The mining industry is quite concentrated at the moment. To help mitigate the risks due to this, it might be useful if many users run fully validating non-mining nodes.
If the hash power is widely distributed across multiple entities and locations, it could be more acceptable for more users to only run SPV nodes.

This sounds like a pragmatic political compromise.  You weigh up what different people want and then have a policy somewhere in the middle.  Is this not how the most prominent currencies like the US dollar already work?  The public vote for a president and representatives who appoint people to manage monetary and fiscal policy.  These individuals try to balance the competing concerns of many people, such as sound money, stable inflation, economic growth, inequality, social good and other factors.  This system seems to work reasonably well, but has some problems, for example conflicts of interest, short term time horizons driven by the election cycle rather than focusing on the long term and the unintended consequences of policy, to name a few.
In my view, most Bitcoiners recognise the strengths and prevalence of currency systems managed and controlled by political factors.  However, to many, Bitcoin is about offering something different, potentially inferior, but different.  It is about having strong and robust rules that cannot easily change, even in the face of political pressure.  In fact it is the ability of rules of the system to remain unchanged despite a powerful political movement to change them, which make the system unique and interesting.  If it didn’t have this quality then to many, Bitcoin would be pretty pointless.  
This is why many do not want a pragmatic political compromise on the blocksize issue, it must be shown that the rules are robust in the face of political pressure.

I think it's also good to factor mining centralisation into this.  If one mining entity has 10% of the hashrate they could easily trick the 100 million SPV  nodes by sending them a payment confirmed in an invalid block with the required difficulty.  Full nodes would not have that problem.
If mining power is highly distributed and fraud proofs are working well, then having a larger percentage of SPV nodes may be ok.

With an SPV node you can validate your own transactions but not others.  Although it is true you have weaker security as the blocks with your valid  transactions in them could be invalid. 
In the future fraud proofs could help mitigate this problem

SPV wallets or light clients can validate the signature of the transaction and that the transaction is included in a block which has the required difficulty.  It is true the block may be invalid, but ensuring work was spent producing the block is better than nothing.
If you are receiving a payment of $10 in a bar, for example, some people may be happy to accept the payment as they think it's sufficiently unlikely anyone would put all the effort in making an invalid block (Let alone 6 blocks) with sufficient difficulty, just to steal $10.

I just want to say thanks very much for work the Core team is doing to increase capacity and improve scaling. Many people in the community really appreciate the hard work and excellent results from the developers, many of whom are still volunteers.
Capacity improvements:
* SegWit - which could almost double capacity
* Schnorr signatures -  which could almost double capacity
* Possible Blocksize increase hardfork to around 2MB - which could be implemented as soon as July 2016, which could also almost double capacity
These three things combined could increase capacity by almost 8x in the next 12 to 18 months.

A system administrator or group of administrators have a master copy of the dataset and have a **policy** of not changing historic data entries.  It really is that simple.  This is a very successful and widely adopted practise.  
Bitcoin is unique in that there are no administrators, which gives Bitcoin some characteristics useful in some niche cases, like strong resilience, censorship resistance and permissionless innovation.

That is not true.  Users who send most transactions will be incentivised to upgrade first, this will have a positive impact on those who do not upgrade, as they will get more space

The switch to libsecp256k1 **is real world scaling** and a **fully delivered result.**  For example my real world node can now catch up with the blockchian, from the genesis block, in about 3 hours rather than 24 hours.  To me this feels like a textbook example of a scalability improvement, I can not understand your complaint.
@_date: 2016-04-20 01:58:27
As you know, unfortunately this is a common misconception. It is caused by some people incorrectly visualizing transactions. I think a good way of addressing this misconception to less technical people is as follows:
* the receiver of bitcoin provides their address to the sender.  
* If the receiver has not upgraded to SegWit, then they will not provide an address which can be redeemed using SegWit. 
@_date: 2016-04-02 03:40:14
* Blockchain = permissionless database
* Permissioned blockchain = permissioned permissionless database = database 
There is nothing "wrong" with a private blockchain or databases.  Databases are already a widely adopted multi billion dollar global industry and tremendously successful in a huge number of fields.  Databases will probably always be more successful and more widely adopted and than Blockchains.

Yes, implementation in July 2016 and then activation in July 2017
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:03:04


Then what do you mean when you say on the receiving side you need a multisig wallet?  Are you saying the sender can't redeem the input of a transaction using SegWit if they send the money to a 1XXXX address, but they can redeem the same input some other way and send to a 1XXXX address?   I did not know that.
@_date: 2016-04-11 11:22:16


Yes that is correct
@_date: 2016-04-11 02:37:16
Great comment.  I think the community should show support for work the Core team is doing to increase capacity and improve scaling. Many people in the community really appreciate the hard work and excellent results from the developers, many of whom are still volunteers.
Capacity improvements:
* SegWit - which could almost double capacity
* Schnorr signatures -  which could almost double capacity

These three things combined could increase capacity by almost **8x** in the next 12 to 18 months.


I am not even sure if that is true.  The great thing about SegWit is even those who do not upgrade get to benefit from more blockspace, as others who do upgrade create more space.  If power users who use a lot of space, like exchanges, upgrade, then this will create more space for lazy/slow users who do not upgrade.
@_date: 2016-04-11 14:35:00
Libsecp256k1 improves the capability of the system to handle a growing amount of capacity in order to accommodate that growth.  It is not directly a capacity increase, that is why it is called scaling.
I did find CPU usage was my bottleneck and it no longer is.  This scalability improvement directly addressed the main bottleneck with an improvement close to one order of magnitude.
Now that the Core team have improved the capability of the system to handle increased capacity.  There will be capacity enhancements in parallel with further scalability improvements
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:15:22


Sorry, I still do not follow.  My understanding is as follows:
* The only way to receive a transaction that can be redeemed by SegWit is to have a SegWit wallet.  Therefore you need to upgrade if you want the benefits of Segwit 
* The output of a transaction which has an input redeemed by SegWit, can be sent to anywhere, just like a non segwit transaction.
Is this not correct?
@_date: 2016-04-11 09:15:22
I think many people will be surprised.  A lot of the transactions are large merchant processors and exchanges, these power users will be able to adopt SegWit and Schnorr signatures very quickly and have the incentives to do so.  In addition to this, these power users often use multi-signature transactions or transactions with many inputs and outputs.  The benefits of these new technologies on these types of transactions are even greater.
@_date: 2016-04-22 07:37:36


The reason they are doing this is because they do not understand what blockchain technology is.  Eventually they will find out it can't enhance their communications with other banks.  Just like how rocket booster technology doesn't improve the nutrition in your breakfast, it is totally unrelated. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 02:04:56
If only a fraction of wallets upgrade, that still creates more room in the blockchain for the wallets who do not upgrade.  The incentives will be structured such that the power users who use a lot of space, like exchanges, may upgrade first, making life very easy for ordinary users.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:30:06


And its more accurate to say that from a user perspective they get more space, which is a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-04-20 02:14:23


Unfortunately this is a common misconception.  I am sorry you feel people are not helping explain this to you.  This issue is highly frustrating to both sides of the debate, as it has been going on a long time and many people are just trying to stir up trouble.
I think your confusion is caused by incorrectly visualizing how transactions work. The best way I can think of explaining this is as follows:
* the receiver of bitcoin provides their address to the sender.  
* If the receiver has not upgraded to SegWit, then they will not provide an address which can be redeemed using SegWit. 
I hope this adequately addresses you concern.
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:38:01


Are you saying if the input in a transaction was redeemed by SegWit, then funds can't be sent to an old format 1XXXX address?  Is that not a large problem for Segwit?  I  am not sure this is correct.
When you say "SegWit transaction", what do you mean? Do you mean the signature of the input is segregated into the extention block data, or do you mean the output can be redeemed when the signature is in the extention block?
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:35:56


Please can you explain this?  If you redeem the input of the transaction using SegWit, then why does it matter what the output is like?  I thought the input and output are separate? 
@_date: 2016-04-10 14:10:41


Old nodes do not have the witness data and do not validate it.  However they do jot need to, since all incoming transactions to old nodes will be in the old format.  Therefore there is no loss in security.


There will already be confirmations as the segwit transaction already happened in history.  This can happen now, your wallet may have coins that were in an any one can spend output in the past.  Old nodes do not receive segwit outputs as they dont provide the sender a segwit address format.
@_date: 2016-04-11 06:42:01


I accept that point, however please realize usage is obviously likely to be heavily skewed towards users who use the network most.  Power users who use the network more will have a greater incentive to upgrade, therefore a high proportion of transactions could be upgraded to these new schemes fairly quickly, even if most of the user-base is slow to upgrade.
The c8x figure is only a potential capacity increase, it doesn't mean we need to reach these levels.
@_date: 2016-04-13 15:16:41

My SQL could certainly do that.  Blockchains would do pretty much the opposite.
@_date: 2016-04-19 04:13:30


No, those that don't upgrade still benefit from more space provided by those that do upgrade.
@_date: 2016-04-10 12:17:42


This is a good point. You are starting to gradually understand the brilliance of the SegWit idea.  After Segwit there will be two kinds of users:
* Upgraded to Segwit - These users fully validate all incoming transactions, but may have to deal with blocks larger than 1MB
* Non upgraded - These users do not upgrade, perhaps because they do not have capacity for blocks over 1MB.  However, **these nodes still fully validate all incoming transactions and there is no reduction in security.**  This is because they only receive non SegWit transactions.
However, thats not all, here is the real genius of Segwit.  **Even the nodes who do not upgrade, still get the benefit of higher capacity and cheaper transactions.**  Since users who do upgrade create more space in the blockchain for the non upgraded users.
SegWit is a win win scenario
@_date: 2016-04-11 08:27:51


That is not true.  If the recipient has not upgraded, then the address the receiver provides to the sender will not be in SegWit format.  Therefore you will not receive SegWit outputs if you have not upgraded.
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:18:10














Well some people clearly "signed up" for these and some didn't.  Cheaper or faster transactions than banking was certainly not one of the things which attracted me.  In the UK, I can send any amount of money to anyone with a UK bank account for free, with a sleek mobile app, in around 200 milliseconds.  Why would Bitcoin ever be any better than that?
And before you say the quality of banking services in the UK is ahead of other regions, that does not really matter as banks in other regions will narrow the gap quickly in the coming decades, way faster than Bitcoin could offer a comparable service.  The related long term problem is inclusion in the banking system, not transaction processing  times or transaction fees.
The point is people are always going to have a different set of reasons why they were attracted to the system.  There is no need to reconcile these differences and having different objectives is fine.  However, the existing consensus rules are the existing consensus rules, no matter what anyone wants.  1MB is a rule, popular or not.  Everyone must respect these rules if they want to be on the same chain.  We should not change these rules unless there is strong agreement across the entire community, the incentives are set up to make this the case.  This robustness of the existing rules is what makes the system different to those which came before it, even if most people hate the rules.

No they have not.  The Core team has already delivered significant scalability improvements.  For example, since the latest version of the software, ECDSA signatures inside Bitcoin transactions use validation using libsecp256k1 rather than OpenSSL, this has improved signature validation speed by around 7x.  This is a huge scalability improvement.  I can not understand why anyone would blame the people who decide to spend a large amount of their time improving scalability, on blocking it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:25:03


That is not true, segwit does not take up less space in the blockchain, it uses MORE space.  Segwit is a blocksize limit increase.  In order to get the benefits of the increase in space, one needs to upgrade, just like for a hardfork blocksize limit increase like BCash.  Segwit has most of the normal advantages and disadvantages of larger blocks.  The main difference with segwit is that it does not create a new coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:24:20
If lower fees is not a customer priority, then why did Coinbase support dangerous hardfork attempts like SegWit2x and BitcoinXT?  I thought it was because fees were such an emergency...
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:56:50
I don't think that's likely.  This analysis is pretty simple, but I think of it like this.  LN will probably be either: 
1. Be a failure and therefore have no impact on fees
2. Become a great success and therefore increase demand for Bitcoin transactions as people want to open payment channels to use LN
I don't agree with the idea that adding new useful technology or features somehow reduces demand

 &gt; There is nothing stopping miners from imposing a soft limit to what they are capable of handling. 
This is not true.  This cartel structure can fall apart as miners defect.  I have explained this again and again
 &gt; it will be harder and harder to create consensus and make a hard fork to remove a block size limit if we need to.
 &gt; If we find growth needs to be limited for whatever reason, there are other ways to achieve that. 
I consider the above two comments a contradiction 
 &gt; I'm not really too interested in debating the merits of BIP101, as that has been done by better advocates elsewhere.
And it was shown to be a very bad idea
 &gt; I really don't understand why you would be willing to take a risk on something uncoded and untested like BIP100
Uncoded is not relevant and you cant test the economic incentives.  I made this point earlier.
 &gt; when the most you're willing to risk on a blocksize increase right now is 2MB. Even SW will create a greater load on the nodes than that.
I mean 2MB + SW.  I was willing to go to 8 MB, however after Montreal and HK I listened to miners and devs and appreciate this risks of increasing the limit too much.
 &gt; impossible if one side continues to demand tests for another 5 to 10 years while transactions have maxed out. 
I said I am happy for an increase now...
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:21:02
Ok fair enough, I agree with this.  However I think its important to also have metrics in place to activate a hardfork and also to give up on activation, to ensure we retain consensus.  I would argue hardforks need strong consensus and at least an 85% level should be used.  The more controversial the fork, the higher the threshold should be. The closer this moves towards 51%, the closer it is to a classic 51% attack.
For example BitcoinXT has a 75% activation threshold over 1,000 blocks.  However, it  does not have a threshold where users give up on activation.  The current threshold being reached is 0.1%.  I think the safe course of action is therefore to give up on the hardfork attempt, otherwise it begins to look more and more like an attack.

Great summary
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:47:10
 &gt; Bandwidth for every single Bitcoin node from &lt;now&gt; until the end of time 
I dont think costs like this can drive fees in many scenarios.  Fees are likely be driven by marginal costs to the miner, i.e the addition to total costs of including **one** extra transaction into the block.  This cost is likely to compromise of a small bit of orphan risk and tiny amount of processing costs.  This marginal cost is likely to be very low, perhaps much lower than for centralised systems like Visa.
In contrast total mining costs, which would include things like electricity, are required to be and are likely to be high.  Therefore we have a significant problem.  I think an economically relevant blocksize limit can address this problem, this would artificially limit supply and push up fees to subsidize hashing costs.  BIP100 may be a good way to achieve this.
@_date: 2015-12-28 00:41:37
How has BIP101 been tested?  The one off increase has been tested, I never had a problem with that part of BIP101.  However BIP101 failed in recent tests with Chinese miners taking minutes to download 8MB blocks in some cases.
BIP103 and many other BIPs are a subset of the increase in BIP101, therefore if BIP101 is the only one that is tested I do not see how that is relevant.  I certainly have not seen robust tests, just a few advocates playing around downloading, propagating and verifying larger blocks.  Non of the tests seem to be BIP101 specific 
Please stop advocating deploying BIP101, this is destroying the community 
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:42:41
 &gt; The point is the idea of not acting without consensus should be abandoned.

This is a top priority, were you at Montreal and HK?  People flew across the world to address this.  Unfortunately irresponsible threats to the network like BitcoinXT are holding things back a bit.
Bitcoin’s future is uncertain and it is a speculative investment whatever happens to the blocksize limit in the short run.  Please value Bitcoin's long term genuinely unique value proposition, which may generate long term investment returns.  Lets not worry so much about the short run, however once BIP101 has been defeated many people may invest more in the short term.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:17:25

1. I don't agree with this, as I believe demand for cheap highly replicated secure storage will eventually prove to be unbounded
2. Even if I did agree, I think we need to consider worst case attack scenarios, which means considering how the network would look with full blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:21:04
I dont see why we should design the network to hit a billion dollar jackpot in 24 hours.  Lets try to create real long term value.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:25:41
I will be presenting on this in HK. Peter is currently reviewing this section of the presentation.
The basic idea is that whatever the relationship between blocksize and marginal orphan risk, total orphan risk will be large in relation to fee revenue.  Infact if there is a linear relationship then fees almost equal orphan risk. This is clearly catastrophic for the network.

 &gt; No money is lost because of orphans. What's so difficult to understand about this?
I mean the gross money lost to orphans.  I assume you mean the net value is much smaller so my point is irrelevant?  This is not the case, larger/better connected miners get the gross advantage.

100% of the hashrate in the last 1,000 blocks is against BIP101, 90% of the nodes are against BIP101, a majority of developers by contribution are against BIP101.  These are far better measures than Reddit comments and Reddit voting.

 &gt; If an alt-coin comes along which actually delivers of the promises of Bitcoin, and has the support of developers with notable names, it has a good chance of taking over
Please have confidence of the uniqueness of Bitcoin’s value proposition.  The security of the network is difficult to replicate and nobody is close.  Remember high capacity is not Bitcoin’s core value proposition, VISA can do up to 80,000 tps, there is no point replicating this.

I meant that there are some circumstances where this will not occur, becuase miners make long term decisions to sacrifice short term cashflow to build smaller blocks, to protect the long term viability of the system.
But ok, lets assume:
**value of orphan risk cost = mining industry fee revenue**




I was being quite conservative earlier, **if orphan risk cost = mining industry fee revenue, I see this as absolutely catastrophic for the network, when the block reward is low**.  This means the amount of money lost due to orphans is the same as the size of the mining industry, to me intuitively this seems bad, however let me try to spell out why.
1. It implies the mining industry is on average loss making. Orphan risk takes up all the revenue, leaving nothing left for electricity, hardware, wages ect.  The mining industry therefore shrinks and network security falls  (Please note, do not think this is fine as miners leaving increases margins, this would be confusing the difficulty adjustment with this revenue problem)
2. Reducing and managing orphan risk would become the key driver in the mining industry.  This would result in mining centralization, let me try to explain:
Remember orphan risk cost = 100% of revenue.  If a miner has 1% of the network hashrate, margins after orphan risk would be 1% better than for tiny miner, since the miner doesn't need to propagate to themselves.  If a miner has 50% of the hashrate, the miner finds 50% of the blocks, therefore propagation risks fall by 50% and margins improve by 50%.  I would therefore argue that by allowing orphan risk cost to equal fee revenue, we lock in catastrophic mining centralization.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:18:11
 &gt; Your argument sounds a bit like a slippery slope fallacy. Accepting BIP101 discussion here, which is a scaling fork, does not mean that the sub is obligated to accept discussion of forks which alter the fundamental economic promise to users.
It was an example to illustrate why censorship might be a good idea in some circumstances and to demonstrate why the moderators have a hard decision.  I have not decided if I agree with the moderators yet.  To me the BIP101 activation threshold should be a key part of the decision.  If it was 50%, then it should be considered a 51% attack and be banned, perhaps 75% is just about ok.  However there is the absence of  a threshold to give up on activation and BIP101 has been stuck at c0% for months.  So I am still undecided on the moderation policy.
 &gt; Even amongst those who disapprove of BIP101, there's hardly a majority who consider BIP101 an outright "attack". 
Nick Szabo - 
 &gt; By failing to make meaningful progress on scaling, we're making a decision to continue with the current limitations without actually coming to a consensus on it.
Fortunately nobody advocates that.  Unfortunately BIP101 is proving to be counterproductive and preventing a blocksize increase.  If the large VC back companies dropped support form BIP101 and switched to BIP102, I am sure we would quickly get consensus.  There are a lot of people in the middle like me, who initially supported Gavin with his proposal to shift to 8MB and was shocked with the excessive 8GB in 2035 idea.  I will still compromise, once BIP101 is defeated.


This depends on the situation.  What about debating whether to go to war, should you start to drop the the bombs before the debate is over?
 &gt; This is what Coinbase is doing: they're signalling that they'll go along with the majority if and/or when it comes to that and BIP101 takes effect.
The point to me is 75% is too low of an activation threshold.  Or more accurately, 25% opposition is too high for a hardfork of this contention.
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:08:52
Please explain your point a bit further.  Are you saying the following:
1. Bitcoin demand increases and usage increases
2. Fees increase
3. Higher fees mean usage falls
4. Equilibrium usage level is reached, at a higher level than the current level 
Why is this even a significant problem?
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:05:30


They did.  BIP103 was released 


There you go, its a dangerous threat.  We should not use this coercive mutual destruction game theory in development.
 &gt; (say to 2MB or 4MB)
There is still a chance we can get this, if companies and Gavin stop pushing for implementation  of BIP101 and instead push for 4MB now.  However it seems there excessive plan has backfired.  Please stop supporting BIP101 now.  You have even admitted its "leverage" aka blackmail.  I cannot think of a worse way to develop software.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:38:51
Yes BIP 100 is more complex, that is why we must stop this panic rush to do something and calmly think about BIP over the next few months or years.
In the unlikely event that a massive distaster occurs, then we can do a one off doubling to 2MB, before calmly thinking of the best long term way forward.  The crazy rush for bigger blocks really concerns me.
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:45:53


I do not think this is true.  If only you open channels then this is true, however if others open channels with you, then  the node can receive more money back than it put in
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:34:46
They wouldn't mine unprofitably.  They could mine up to the point where marginal orphan risk = the fee;  that would maximise short term profit.  
This could mean total fee revenue is around the same size as gross total orphan risk cost.  This means orphan risks are significant relative to the mining industry size, which would be disastrous for a variety of reasons.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:14:19
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:30:49
As a side note, miners and the ecosystem suffer and lose money from higher orphan risk, due to wasted work and lower difficulty.  Although I am sure you agree this is not relevant to our discussion.
Anyway, lets say your correct, the mining industry as a whole does not lose money from higher orphan rates, becauae everytime a miner loses an orphan race another miner wins, right?  This is true, thats why I should use the term "gross orphan risk costs", this figure still exists its just the net figure which can be thought of as zero.  The disadvantages I mentioned before still apply, it still causes mining centralisation, its just that the larger miners win and the smaller miners lose.  It still takes away profit from smaller less well connected miners.  This is why the gross figure is important for this analysis.  
Remember the industry is dynamic, things always change, miners are different sizes and get bigger and smaller.  Its unlikely we will have a situation where all miners are the same and the orphan risk balances out between them such that they dont have a comparitive advantage over smaller miners.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:24:51
Ok. The 32MB message limit.  Sure I would be happy moderately increasing it back to that level, I am sure many people would be fine with that. I just oppose the 8GB in BIP101 
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:07:35
If the relationship is linear, fee revenue = orphan risk.  Therefore the size of the orphan risk will tend to the size of the entire mining business.  This is clearly catastrophic 
Remember miners include transactions up to the point where fee revenue = marginal orphan risk cost.  If orphan risk cost is uniform, then then the fee will fall to this uniform level.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:38:18
This "wasted work" idea is a valid consept and just one of the reasons why a high orphin risk relative to mining revenue is very bad.
Remember "wasted work" is not only the work spent building the orphaned block, but also the work spent trying to build on top of a block that was orphaned, before the miner finds the main chain.
This is actually a big problem today and the cost of wasted work is probably higher than fee revenue today.
Remember this discussion is about Peter's idea of having orphan risk costs drive fees and prevent them falling to zero. There are probably many technical solutions to these problems which will dramatically reduce orphan risk cost in the coming years, this only makes relying on orphan risk costs to generate fees more inappropriate.  If your not conviced orphan riskis a real cost anyway, it can't sustain fees in the first place, you can't have it both ways.  Orphan risk is either a cost or it isn't.
By the way, wasted work reduces the network difficulty, which **is** analogous to security.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:16:03
Sorry I do not follow 
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:01:38
I like Meni's proposal.  It doesn't really add new constants but makes the existing block size limit more "fuzzy".  This is likely to help a fee market develop. 
In an environment where the marginal cost of hashing for an extra transaction is zero, how can a good fee market develop?  In a free market price = marginal cost.  This proposal helps a market by ensuring there is a cost of adding more transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:46:53


Is your plan to implement and activate subchains before or after increasing the blocksize based on it?  If its to increase the blocksize before subchains based in that, its like jumping out of a plane before trying to build your parachute.  I will read your paper in detail in the coming weeks.


That is great news.  I will look into subchains and see if value of orphan risk cost &lt;&lt; mining industry fee revenue.  Out of interest due you agree that if value of orphan risk cost = mining industry fee revenue, than this is very bad for the viability of the network?

Now is the time to talk about it
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:24:39


In a competitive environment price = marginal cost.  Miners construct blocks up to the point where marginal orphan risk cost is equal to the fee.  This **guarantees** orphan risk is high relative to fee revenue.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:51:22
Air is considered a non economic good.  It is useful, however it is not really scarce, nobody owns it and there is no price.
It is true there are costs of adding a transaction to a block.  Currently the largest cost is block propagation time.  Verification is also a small cost, as you say.  These costs should fall over time as technology improves.  It is actually crucial these costs do fall, to help bitcoin scale and reduce the risk of mining centralisation.  I would even go as far to say that it's absolutely necessary for these costs to be insignificant to ensure low barriers to entry in the mining industry.  Once these costs are low enough they will be economically irrelevant.
I know we both agree that it's good if these costs come down, as it makes the network more efficient.  What I think it is important to realise is why we have miners doing the hashing.  Miners do not exist to listen for transactions, verify tranactions and propagate transactions.  These things are relatively cheap, simple and easy to do.  They could be done very easily without miners.  Miners exist to do an extremely complex task, which has many possible attack vectors.  The purpose of miners and core characteristic of bitcoin is to enable the network to come to consensus about the one true state of the blockchain.  The small costs of adding transactions to blocks are not related to this underlying purpose.  The reason there is no relationship is because adding more transactions to a block, does not increase the target difficulty.  If we design the system without considering this misalignment and treat it like a "normal market", then we could lose consensus.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:13:43
Please be patient.  What is the rush?  We need to give developers time to carmly and patiently implement scalling solutions over the coming decades.  Please stop this irresponsible and disrespectful rush.

@_date: 2015-06-12 22:51:10
Do you agree with me that Jeff's proposal could be an improvement over the max block size equals some multiple of the median block size in the last n blocks idea?  Under the median block size proposal any single entity could game the system.  Under Jeff's proposal only a majority of miners can make the policy change.  It is as if the mining industry  has a permanent rolling vote on which blocksize limit will maximise fees based on demand and projected price elasticity of demand.  This may be a good economic idea, but I need to think about it further.
One thing a don't get is why the max blocksize can only increase under this proposal.  What if demand for bitcoin falls and miners feel their revenue will increase if the max blocksize is reduced? (which is possible depending on the price elasticity of demand), Why can't miners reduce the limit in the same way as an increase?

Dear PumpkinFeet
The trouble with Bitcoin is that we need consensus about political and economic issues, often in quite a specific, nuanced and complex mathematical framework and therefore any slight differences of opinion are often difficult to reconcile.
For example take interest rates in the economy, I am sure many Bitcoiners think that the government should not attempt to influence the interest rate in the economy and instead let supply and demand for credit find its own equilibrium price.  This would result in a more robust and flexible system, with a more innovative economy and efficient allocation of capital, than the current manipulated interest rate environment.
However, we need to accept there are some circumstances where, unfortunately, it is necessary for the authorities to intervene in the market where property rights cannot be defined effectively and there are externalities.  For example in the fishing industry I advocate government quotas in some circumstances.  The ownership of fish cannot be defined due to technical limitations as the fish can swim anywhere in the sea and cannot be tracked.  Therefore without quotas, individual fisherman may maximise their own profit, overfishing could occur and then there may be insufficient fish reserves to support society, the amount of fishing would be non optimal as ordinary people can no longer eat fish.  Maybe this logic is uncomfortable, makes too many arrogant judgements about others, creates a justification for a privileged elite and violates peoples freedoms, but the facts might be such that we either have the quotas or never eat fish again.
Bitcoin does share some properties with this hypothetical fishing problem, the property rights of the blockchain cannot be defined for technical reasons.  Nobody owns the blockchain and it is necessary for the data to be widely replicated in order for the system to remain viable.  Without quotas on the blocksize, individual miners may maximise their own profit, too many transactions will be included in blocks and the blockchain will be too large for many people to store the blockchain and ordinary people can no longer fully participate in Bitcoin.
In addition to this, without a quota, the transaction fee would become too low to incentivise mining.   As Meni Rosenfeld brilliantly put it:










@_date: 2015-06-04 21:31:04
Good article.  Clearly subsidies and quotas  often don't work and have unintended consequences.  I am saying there might be a case when they could apply.  Remember Bitcoin is not an evolved part of nature, Bitcoin was designed with a wide range of quotas and subsidies from the start.   If you can design a distributed consensus system without this, please do.  
Bitcoin never had defined property rights for each part of the system from the start either.  They were never disrupted because they never existed. The reality is we cannot define them, there is no point being in denial of this.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:38:33


This is not true, orphaning does have negative impacts on the network as a whole.
1. If blocks are orphaned, statistically fewer blocks are found as work is wasted, this lowers the network difficulty and helps attackers
2. Higher orphan rates risks cause centralisation, since miners dont need to propagate to themselves.  **Therefore higher orphan risks shift the revenue to larger miners**
3.  Larger or better connected miners have lower orphan risks, but they may be less efficient at hashing or have higher energy costs.  The revenue may shift towards better connected miners from miners more efficient at hashing.  This may lower the network hashrate and damage security. 
4. An attacker can produce empty blocks and have a huge competitive advantage over honest miners with larger blocks, since the attacker has lower orphan risk.  Higher orphan risk therefore helps attackers
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:27:19


This is **not** all Greg is worried about, nor all that I am worried about.  Higher relative orphan risk  also causes mining centralisation as well as lower difficulty.  This wasted work point is just one of the causes of lower difficulty. (And the difficulty **is** equivalent of the value of network security by the way)


There is no consensus on orphan rates as this is outside of the consensus process, therefore this is not possible.  Also confirmations would take longer and network capacity would fall.  People seem potentially very keen on improving capacity not reducing it.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:00:13
Havent we discussed these charts already?  Also is your plan to implement and activate subchains before or after increasing the blocksize based on it?
Thank you for praising my apparent knowledge on economics.  
I think your economic theory may be right for some of the time, because miners will not produce blocks where fee revenue is equal to total orphan risk costs, because miners will care about the long term and protecting their revenue and the system.
Please let my try to contextualise my concerns.  I currently work as an investment analyst in the resource mining industry and regularly speak to CEOs of some of the largest mining firms in the world about strategy and how to maximize cashflow. In 2015 the industry is in complete chaos and panic mode, with everyone only caring about the short term and cashflow. I was part of a team that won the award for being the best performing mining fund in the year, returning c10% compared to the benchmark which lost c30%. This was achieved by understanding that industry incentives can change throughout the cycle and different assets are valuable in different ways when mining management teams act differenty. We need to be aware that Bitcoin mining will also go through cycles and we need to be prepared for a scenario where miners only care about short term cashflow. Many people will ignore this cycle and assume thinks will carry on as thet always have done, but we need to be smart and ensure Bitcoin is robust, which means considering all possible scenarios. Despite the fact that the majority may not see these issues, we need to stand firm and prevent BIP101.
Bitcoin needs to be more robust than other payment systems.  We need to think very carefully about the mining incentives and how they could change though cycles.
I  often get questions like:
"In the last 6 years fees havent fallen to the marginal orphan risk cost, so what makes you think this will happen?"
There are a number of reasons the last six years may not be relevant, but my point is industries change, often in ways people don't expect.  I think this will happen to Bitcoin mining at some point.  I have experienced a few cycles in my time in different industries  dont see why Bitcoin will be exempt.
So back to the title:
**"Transaction fees can pay for proof-of-work security without a restrictive block size limit"**
I agree with this, fees **can** pay for PoW security, however in some periods of time they **won't**
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:11:21
Does it make any difference to due whether the competing implementations are compatible, with respect to being on the same blockchain?  Or is this irrelevant as far as you are concerned?
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:52:21
 &gt; Well lets see. Pools that supported XT have been DDOS'ed. Exchanges that support it are now being DDOS'ed.
Well Bitcoin needs to be robust against DDOS attacks anyway, so if the XT infrastructure is too weak to withstand DDOS attacks, thank god it doesn't have wide support.
Out of interest, would you rather XT infrastructure was DDOS'ed before or after activation?


I am not using discussion threads at any of those places as one of my ways of measuring things, I said "These are far better measures than Reddit comments and Reddit voting".  I will list the measures them again for you below:
1. Miners - 100.0%, or **1,000 of the last 1,000 blocks are against BIP101**.  This is the official activation measure in the proposal.  You can claim pools are being DDOSed, but 1,000 out of 1,000 is pretty decisive.  What is the level you are willing to concede defeat at?
2. Nodes - 90% of the nodes are not BIP101
3. Developers - The developers of the code are against BIP101
None of those three things are Reddit discussions or BitcoinTalk discussions or communities.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:36:48

Dear Justusranvier
It is clear you think Meni’s proposal is a solution to a problem you think does not exist.  This is because you and I have a difference of opinion about technical, political and economic issues.  However I am sure that if somebody put you and I in an 80,000 seater stadium, with 79,998 other people, we would find our views on these topics are more similar to each other than the other 79,998 people.  The trouble with Bitcoin is that we need consensus about political and economic issues, often in quite a specific, nuanced and complex mathematical framework and therefore any slight differences of opinion are often difficult to reconcile.
For example take interest rates in the economy, I am sure you share my view that the government should not attempt to influence the interest rate in the economy and instead let supply and demand for credit find its own equilibrium price.  This would result in a more robust and flexible system, with a more innovative economy and efficient allocation of capital, than the current manipulated interest rate environment.  Do you agree with me on this?
However, I accept there are some circumstances where, unfortunately, it is necessary for the authorities to intervene in the market where property rights cannot be defined effectively and there are externalities.  For example in the fishing industry I advocate government quotas in some circumstances.  The ownership of fish cannot be defined due to technical limitations as the fish can swim anywhere in the sea and cannot be tracked.  Therefore without quotas, individual fisherman may maximise their own profit, overfishing could occur and then there may be insufficient fish reserves to support society, the amount of fishing would be non optimal as ordinary people can no longer eat fish.  Do you agree there are some circumstances, at least in theory, where this could apply?  Maybe this logic is uncomfortable, makes too many arrogant judgements about others, creates a justification for a privileged elite and violates peoples freedoms, but the facts might be such that we either have the quotas or never eat fish again.
Bitcoin does have this problem, the property rights of the blockchain cannot be defined for technical reasons.  Nobody owns the blockchain and it is necessary for the data to be widely replicated in order for the system to remain viable.  Without quotas on the blocksize, individual miners may maximise their own profit, too many transactions will be included in blocks and the blockchain will be too large for many people to store the blockchain and ordinary people can no longer fully participate in Bitcoin.  Do you agree there are some circumstances, at least I theory, where this could apply? 
In addition to this, without a quota, the transaction fee would become too low to incentivise mining.   As Meni himself brilliantly put it:










@_date: 2015-06-13 21:03:51
Ok you can have that as part of your definition of a good.  I have another analogy then.
What about music files?  The songs are produced, however with no government regulation, the cost of copying and broadcasting the file is economically insignificant and supply is almost infinite.  I would say that music files should therefore be non economic goods with a zero price.  
This could be similar to transactions in blocks, when there is no limit.   The costs of including a transaction in a block is economically insignificant and the price will be zero.  This is almost a non economic good.
@_date: 2015-06-06 08:40:08
Is it possible to remove the rollover fee pool from your proposal to solve this potential issue?
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:30:40


I totally 100% agree with the above quote.  This is 's idea, my comments here are part of explaining why orphan risk should not and cannot be used in this way.
Part of my argument is explaining that high orphan risks does have network wide negative effects.  Like mining centralisation and wasted work, to name a few.
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:51:32
I never mentioned  $5 fees.  I hope volumes increase and fees fall.  I am only against BIP101, which I consider excessive.  I am in the middle ground on this issue.
@_date: 2015-06-21 16:36:29
Miners do not bare the full cost of their blocks.  Do you run a full node?  Others also bare some cost.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:18:22
Yes, both sides have a somewhat circular argument.  BIP101 supporters say the costs are small, but then they argue these costs will support a fee market.
The correct logic is this:
If the costs are large, BIP101 doesnt work.
If the costs are small, BIP101 still doesnt work for the other reason
BIP101 fails in almost any mining coat scenario, that is why it is very dangerous.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:28:08


Well technology is likely to improve a lot and many people have great ideas on how to reduce orphan risk cost, like IBLT, weak blocks, ect ect


Yes I know, I also tried to explain this above.  My point is the revenue goes to larger miners and we have centralisation.


I have thought about it and explained it. As I said before, somebody has to find the block.


This is largely semantics, I only significantly disagree with this comment to the extent that work is wasted on orphans and security falls, in the interim.  I guess you are correct in the sense that in the medium term the larger miner will have more revenue and therefore invest more in  hardware, so difficultly doesnt fall, mining just becomes more centralised.
 
(Although it could reduce the difficulty as competition falls and hashing moves from lower energy cost or efficient miners to larger better connected miners)
(Also miners could spend more on bandwidth/latency reduction and therefore less on hashing)
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:53:38


Yeah sure, effective hashing power is also a good term. I dont see why this is charitable though.  Using the word difficulty is also fine, in the context of assuming the 10 minute target time is constant.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:55:30
Yes this is a risk if an alt coin has a better feature.  I do not see how increases the blocksize limit reduces this risk 
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:26:18
A year on year 40% increase is an extreme  position when 4/5 of the core devs don't even support a one off move to 20MB.  If Gavin insists on an automatic increase, supporting the other 4 devs is the best way of resolving the issue and achieving consensus.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:19:32
It is great that Gavin accepts there is no consensus on when fees are high enough so that the blocksize limit should be raised.  However, this is inconsistent with a proposal to increase the limit on a fixed schedule to 8GB, without any regard to the level of demand.  It should be clear to everyone by now that BIP 100 &gt;&gt; BIP 101.  BIP 100 has a mechanism where miners vote based on expectations about user demand, in order to maximise mining revenue.  BIP 100 is a well thought out, dynamic proposal which will allow for blocksize limit increases inline with a actual demand.

 &gt; Right now bitcoin, along with all all the altcoins, is charting the cryptocurrency waters. Talking about some kind of end goal is a bit premature at this point.
Great point.  That is why we should focus on keeping our options open and not being forced to choose one of these paths right now.  Luckily right now it looks like there is plenty of middle ground.  I really hope we don't chose an extreme end of the spectrum like BIP101 or 1MB forever.  Lets be pragmatic and compromise.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:08:43
You are making assumptions that the price in USD will increase.  The block reward is guarenteed to half every 4 years, forever.  No price will increase exponentially forever, that is a bad assumption.

Because there is no real marginal cost of including a transaction in a block.  Therefore it could become a non economic good.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:15:37
A miner gets a fee for putting a transaction in the block they found.  The marginal cost of hashing for one extra transaction is zero, where as all full nodes need to verify, download and store the transaction, which has a cost.  There is a fundamental misalignment of incentives here, which needs to be addressed.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:45:49
Ok that seems reasonable.
Jeff what do you think of Meni's elastic block size with rollover idea?  Potentially combined with a median rule.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:27:58

Yes the potential is large.  Lets patiently, prudently and carmly work through the challenges and difficulties we face, to try and build a robust system, which can reach this potential.  However, this wont be easy, there will be setbacks, more debates and crisis.  Please dont rush the process.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:32:49


I agree.  That is why I oppose locking in large limit increases as the block reward falls to 0.39BTC.  Other than that I could support most moderate limit increase proposals.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:27:46
What does optimal for users mean?  This is a subjective question with no precise answer. Isn't it optimal for Bitcoin and its users  for the system to be more secure?  i.e. more mining revenue.  Higher volume may be optimal for some users in the short run.  But over the long run isn't security the core proposition for users?
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:46:46
Will the rollover pool encourage mining centralisation? A larger miner will have an advantage creating bigger blocks, as they can earn back more of the penalty in the future than smaller miners.

@_date: 2015-06-12 22:53:19
This proposal could be an improvement over the max block size equals some multiple of the median block size in the last n blocks idea? Under the median block size proposal any single entity could game the system. Under this proposal only a majority of miners can make the policy change. It is as if the mining industry has a permanent rolling vote on which blocksize limit will maximise fees based on demand and projected price elasticity of demand. This may be a good economic idea, but I need to think about it further
One thing a don't get is why the max blocksize can only increase under this proposal. What if demand for bitcoin falls and miners feel their revenue will increase if the max blocksize is reduced? (which is possible depending on the price elasticity of demand), Why can't miners reduce the limit in the same way as an increase?

There are technically more constants, but the impact is to limit existing constants without imposing new constraints.  I acknowledge more constants, formulae and complexity is a shame, but it may be necessary in this inperfect problematic system.




 
This is correct, but the other costs could be very small and tend to zero.  For example IBLT.

Rachel and Phoebe know that Chandler and Monica are an item, however Chandler and Monica don't know they know.  Chandler and Monica find out that Rachel and Phoebe know, but "they don't know they know they know".  Without a perfect communication system, this iterative process can continue to infinity.  This is somewhat analogous to the Byzantine Generals Problem. (
Bitcoin aims to solve this problem, by adding a series proof of works to the message, with each confirmation adding more certainty in an exponential way.  The brilliant part is one can then look at the hashing power involved and the hashing power available, to conclude that everyone was involved in the hashing.  This ensures that everyone knows and everyone knows everyone knows, to infinity...

Why cant we adopt a proposal that us consistent with  for a few years, but leaves the option of  or  open after that period?
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:40:39
How does adding a transaction into a block require significant time, matter, or energy.  The quantities involved could become so insignificant in relation to hashing that they become irrelevant.  Anyway let’s assume the marginal cost is actually exactly zero, do you admit we have a potential issue then?
 
Mining has a large positive externality, however you seem to ignore positive externality even as a valid concept.  Please carefully consider how having your transaction included in a block is different to the miner hashing.  Do you accept this?
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:26:18
A year on year 40% increase is an extreme  position when 4/5 of the core devs don't even support a one off move to 20MB.  If Gavin insists on an automatic increase, supporting the other 4 devs is the best way of resolving the issue and achieving consensus.
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:01:07
Ok.  But usage would still be above current levels?  That doesn't seem like something to fear or an emergency.  Its just moderate growth.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:53:31
Sorry you must have not read the comment above.  In the whitepaper it says the "incentive **can transition** entirely to transaction fees".  Obviously in the last 6 years we have had a large block reward.  This reward exponentially declines over time, to just 0.39BTC in the BIP101 period.  We will eventually need a fee market to "transition entirely to transaction fees".
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:59:28
I think if big companies like Coinbase abandoned BIP101, and instead advocated compromises like BIP103, we could reach consensus quite quickly

No, I want to allow anything on the blockchain, as long as a high enough fee is paid.  Let the market decide what is a valid use of the blockchain 
 &gt; If I were a programmer, I'd love to submit a BIP.
My point is its completely impossible.  Any data can be encoded into an output address, for example and its impossible to stop this.
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:02:46
Yes I happily support your great compromise proposal, just like I would support BIP202, BIP102 and BIP103.  I am sure moderate and reasonable proposals like yours could easily get consensus, if people on both sides of the argument stopped being so childish and stopped advocating absolutist views that cannot get consensus.  
In particular Coinbase now appears to join the ranks of people potentially trying to initiate a contentions hardfork.  We must stop these attacks on the network and compromise.  Please can Coinbase stop running BIP101 and run moderate compromise proposals like yours, with a 95% activation threshold so it feels less like an attack.
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:42:23
There are only really one trend driving this data.  Bitcoin is growing, therefore both market cap and tx volume have increased over time.

Cost "allocation" is more of an accounting thing and subjective.  Try thinking about it from an industry perspective or what drives investment decisions.  
What if the total value of all orphan risk cost in the industry is approximately equal to mining industry fee revenue?  Although statically most individuals may see the orphan risk cost as an opportunity cost only, on average I think this causes large problems.  Does that seem intuitively like a healthy industry you?  
Remember at some point fee revenue will approach all mining industry revenue, we could therefore have orphan risk cost being around the same size as the entire mining industry, minimising orphan risk becomes the key competitive driver.  The inevitable consequence of this is mining centralisation, since miners do not need to propagate blocks to themselves.

Well do you really want to be on a chain that can be attacked by a coin with a more powerful network?  All exchanges want to be on the most work chain.
Exchanges, users, developers and financial markets can all change their minds.  Miners changing their mind is almost impossible.  Once the miners make a decision, thats it.  This is why miners have the power to make this decision.

 &gt; 2) Anyone should feel free to fork his project, and it would be odd to call that an "attack on Bitcoin," as some have.
Anyone is free to fork his project.  It only becomes an attack on Bitcoin if it deliberately tries to split the blockchain.  For example having a contentions  hardfork with a 50% to 75% activation threshold.  I think BIP101 meets this criteria.  If the BIP101 activation threshold increased significantly, it may no longer be classified as an attack.

@_date: 2015-12-30 18:12:27
 Of course in a classic 51% attack the wasted work issue obviously does not apply to the attacker, as I guess they have 51% of the power locally so don't have orphans, the attacker would be trying to orphan off the rest of the network, so higher propagation costs would help the attacker.
In general high orphan rates help attackers and help with a selfish mining attack.
Also an attacker could mine empty blocks with tiny orphan risk  to help with the attack.
@_date: 2015-06-13 08:08:19
Or to put it another way, in the median idea each miner could selfishly include more transactions in blocks to maximise next block profit, even if it damages long term profits.
The vote is more likely to be driven by longer term profit concerns. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 08:19:16
The reasonable news is that Gavin has confirmed the opposite, he is committed to supporting the most work chain, whatever happens with respect to the blocksize and whether he likes it or not.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:23:35


I agree.  Thats why we shouldn't lock ourselves into any long term decisions about mining incentives today.  We all need to recognise there is a lot we don't know and keep an open mind.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:21:25
This average/median proposal gives miners more power which will cause more problems.  Each miner would make larger blocks to maximise short term profit and Bitcoin as a whole suffers.  This is analogous to the tragedy of the commons problem.  Jeff's proposal is better as miners make a collective long term economic decision to maximise revenue and benefit the entire network.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:27:08
There have been many solutions put forward:
Jeff - BIP 100
Meni - Elastic blocksize with rollover pool
Sergio - CoVar of transaction fee minimum
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:20:44
This is completely untrue.  Have you read the well thought out technical opposition the core devs have?  The core dev team have been involved in this space around 5 years and 4 out of 5 of the core devs oppose this very risky move to implement 8GB blocks.  After all these people have contributed can you not listen to them instead of making false accusations?
We need the blocksize limit to come into play and actually restrict the number of transactions that would otherwise occur.  Without this limit there is no basis for transaction fees and therefore no sustainable reason to mine.  Without mining Bitcoin is dead.  There have great proposals to address this problem like BIP100, which we should consider.
Gavin's aggressive approach to go for 8GB blocks is dangerous and will destroy the network, if growth is not high enough.  Making assumptions about continued exponential growth over the next 20 years is unnecessary and dangerous.  We need to oppose the 8GB fork otherwise Bitcoin's incentive structure is not sustainable and Bitcoin will not survive.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:59:19
Hashing to find a solution (what miners do) and adding more transactions to the block are orthognol.  The market equlibrium you talk of therefore makes no sense.  Please PM me your contact details and we can dicuss this in person.
@_date: 2015-06-14 08:29:47
This is a sensible comment.  Overruling the most work chain to get this fork is mad solution which undermines the whole system .
Miners are part of the economic consensus mechanism anyway.  If miners belive that users, merchants  and exchanges support Mike's fork, they will probably move over to keep the system converging on one set of rules and secure their revenue anyway.

@_date: 2015-06-14 08:59:52
Meni this is a great analysis of Jeff's proposal.  I partially agree with many of your concerns.  Let me briefly comment on the proposals you mentioned. 
Regular flame war.
I actually agree that this solution may not be that bad.  However the problem is that if the system grows the number of people and organisations involved could expand and the debates could become less well informed and highly influenced by government. 
Jeff's proposal.
I understand your concerns and the proposal is far from perfect, but I actually don't think this proposal is that bad. Miners may vote to maximise reveneue in the long run.  The industry will respond in some ways to consumer demand.  If demand increases and fees increase, then more and more people will stop using bitcoin because of the high fees.  The mining industry should notice this change in price elasticity of demand and make a judgement about this when they vote on the blocksize limit.  At the same time if demand falls the fee will start to decline and the remaining hard core users may have a more inelastic demand curve, so miners decide to lower the limit.   The interests of miners and users is not perfectly aligned, but there is a strong relationship in the long run or period for which the vote takes place.  This proposal is therefore superior to the median blocksize rule, when more short term mining interests are at play.
With respect to cellphones, yes there would be less cellphones which cost more, however cellphone manufacturers would vote for a profit maximising limit and there would be plenty of cellphones around.  The trouble is there would be a lack of innovation, profits would be high enough and there would be no incentive to research and make a iPhone.   Luckily we only need miners to include transactions in blocks not design new products.  The mining industry is unique and no analogy is perfect, but I think this proposal is a reasonable compromise.
Bitcoin days destroyed vote.
This is a system run by the wealthy for the wealthy.
On balance I actually prefer your elastic limit plus rollover pool combined with the median blocksize rule.  However Jeff's proposal is far simpler, easier to implement and avoids a "political polynomial" present in you proposal, which could cause arguments.
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:22:38

I didn't say I see no difference.  I said its an example to show censorship is sometimes necessary, to help you understand what is motivating the mods.  The mods have a difficult decision.


Please stop with this devisive and counterproductive staw man argument.  BIP101 locks in 8GB blocks by 2035, this is a huge 8,000x increase.   That 8GB is my problem, I do not care about keeping a 1MB limit and nobody (I know of) thinks its one of the "fundamental tenents of Bitcoin."
In my view establishing a fee market at some point and the 21M limit are actually assosiated ideas.  As the Bitcoin whitepaper says:
"Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the **incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees** and be completely **inflationfree.**"
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:22:03
Yes, scalling is a difficult challenge.  It is great if investors reflect the reality of this challenge in their investment decisions.  If investors are poorly informed and overlook to many serious issues, we should be concerned.

Sorry, i dont understand this.  Please can you try to explain again.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:32:39
That is not a prudent way of looking at things.  We need to consider the actual economic value of the usage, which we can measure by the economic value of the transaction fees users are willing to pay.
Satoshi Dice generated a huge amount of volume in the past.  Who is to say what fringe uses/games are developed in the future which can generate more transactions?  Generating data is not that difficult.  What matters is the value users get form the transactions and how much they are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:27:46
Well, wasted work falls as the miner gets larger.  Therefore it would help the miner get from 20% to 50%
Also reaching 51% of the effective hashing power is easier as the effective hashing power is lower due to wasted work.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:26:32
Thanks.  This debate has been going on since early 2011 and nobody has the right answer.  This is because it depends on the circumstances in the mining industry at the time.  Therefore we should try to design the system such that it is robust in a variety of scenarios.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:30:01
 &gt; Are you saying that anyone that supports Bitcoin should do their best to try to DDOS and otherwise sabotage Bitcoin related services?
Nope, I am just saying you shouldn't use it as an excuse for your failure.
 &gt; removal from Bitcoin-related pages in the name of "coercion".
I agree with you the "coersion" idea is bad.  I do not know who made that comment or whether they were acting as an agent provocateur.  Many BIP101 supporters have a similair philosophy, saying BIP101 is leverage or to run BitcoinXT to "encourage things to move forward" as the Coinbase CEO said on Twitter.  This feels like coesion to me.


As did I, I supported 8MB blocks also, before I was shocked by the excessive BIP101 move with 8GB blocks in 2035.  Perhaps I am still willing to do this, although I feel consensus can only be reached at 2MB now.
 &gt; That they're not mining XT blocks currently only means that they're waiting for consensus, not that they're against it
Did you go to HK?  I spoke to most of the hashpower in HK and they seemed pretty robust in their opposition to BIP101 to me.


The majority of the hashpower was voting for BIP100 at one point.  BIP100 is my favored proposal, but Gavin, the industry and the community did nothing.  So it looks like there might be no hardfork.  Its wrong to now complain that nodes have old software, almost all miners were voting.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:50:21


Any reduction in orphan risk invalidates your initial point in you other paper, that orphan risks stop fees falling to zero.  You cant have it both ways.  Remember fees fall to marginal cost, marginal cost is the orphan risk, reducing ophan risk does not help.   That is precisely why I intuitively  dislike your idea in the first place.


What's the difference?
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:04:59


There is censorship of encouraging people to adopt a hardfork before consensus.  You can still try to build consensus, but you should not advocate implementation before consensus.
The moderators have a difficult decision, I certainly do not necessarily support what they have done, but I recognize it is very difficult for them.
For example, what if somebody had released a client that increases the block reward and gave the extra reward to a particular private individual. Should we allow people to post comments on which advocate the download of that client and the running of that code?  Or should it be censored?  I know this example is different, but hopefully it may illustrate to you the difficulties the moderators face.  Many people consider BIP101 an attack on the network, people are allowed to discuss the attack on but advocating implementing the attack is not allowed.  I hope you can appreciate the point of view of the moderators a bit better now.
 &gt; How can you even achieve a majority consensus when you'll block discussion and start blacklisting anyone who disagrees, like was done with Coinbase here?
I think it is about understanding two distinct concepts:
1. Advocating an idea and putting forward arguments that support your idea
2. Encouraging the activation and implementation of the idea, before you have persuaded others of its merit
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:38:09
The economic value of the transactions could be low.

I agree, if there is going to be a war over this the most conservative approach most likely to win wider support should be used.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:09:58
There needs to be a constraint on the blocksize one way or another.  I don't like having a "size we think it should be" either, but I see no other solution.
There is no supply demand equilibrium, when supply is infinite and price is therefore zero, that is a non economic good.  Miners do hashing to produce a valid block, that is a different concept to supply for transactions, this is the issue.  Supply is orthogonal to the activity miners are doing.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:44:40


I agree, lets provide **some** runway.  Providing an 8,000x increase until 2035 goes well beyond "some runway" and is clearly excessive.  BIP101 is proving to be counterproductive and preventing the creation of a reasonable runway.
@_date: 2015-06-13 16:05:02

So why dont we be reasonable and provide the users with that increase?
 Instead a ridiculous extreme proposal is released to "leverage" other developers into providing the increase.  Please can we use direct and honest tactics, rather than the divisive, dangerous and counterproductive "leverage"/threat of mutual destruction method.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:00:19
 &gt; How long do you think it's acceptable to wait? 
For what exactly?  A blocksize increase? I would be happy if this happens now, but at the same time I would be happy waiting 5 or 10 years.  It depends on many factors, I think being calm and patient is very important, perhaps more important than the issue itself.
 &gt; Other coins have already come out that do more and work better than bitcoin. 
Please name one?  Etheruem has a built in self destruct mechanism to shift to the unproven PoS idea, for example.
 &gt; Is there a point where you think we have enough data to make a decision? 
Yes, I would be happy to increase to 2MB now for example, or even take a risk and support BIP100.  
 &gt; There's already plenty of test data showing BIP101 working just fine.
The main issues I have with BIP101 are based on incentives and therefore cannot be tested.  I consider BIP101 excessive and destructive, as locking us in to an 8000x increase in the limit by 2035 takes us down a pathway where mining incetives may breakdown.  Instead of this we should keep our options open.  Why do you care so much about dividing the community by supporting locking in changes from 2028 to 2033 for example?  We do not know what will happen in this period.  Please be open minded.  If anything, **please could we agree not to make assumptions beyond 2030?**  One would think sensible people could agree on that.
At the same time miners say they can only cope with 2MB right now.  The data actually says BIP101 will cause problems now.  Latency behind the great firewall of China is high and volatile, the test on testnet had massive delays of 105 seconds for block propagation.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:53:01
If you have a market, where the marginal cost of supply is zero and there are no barriers of entry, then it seems to me it could be a non economic good, if it's a homogeneous product.  Now one  thing that supports your point of view is that it might not be a homogeneous product, as some miners may confirm transactions faster than others.  This is why the situation is unique and complex and I don't know the right answer with certainty.  However the idea that if the mining industry is competitive and there is no size limit, miners will eventually accept any fee, seems reasonable to me.
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:05:11
Please put forward your simple BIP that does the impossible then.
By the way I would oppose this as I do not want to censor types of usage.  I think the fee market should be used to ensure the usage with the most economic utility to the user gets on the chain.

In the past zero fee transactions were common and they still are possible  today.  The reality is most current users use the wallet default fee and the fee market is not really working.  Also currently block propagation costs are a real cost to miners, fees need to cover this.

I am using XT as the scapegoat for your claim that investors are staying away.  Personally I am not even sure I agree with the claim that much.

 &gt; the demand for **cheap** highly-replicated perpetual storage is unbounded
Emphasis added.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:40:12
My thinking is as follows:
Under the median blocksize size proposal, a miner with 25% of the global hash rate could send transactions to themselves in 25% of blocks and then target 25% of the other blocks with transactions and fees to increase the median.
Under BIP100, a majority of miners need to make a judgement that the higher demand will continue.  This is far from perfect, but seems more robust than the median idea.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:57:26


With an economically relevant blocksize limit highly, it is highly likely that fee revenue will be much larger than gross orphan risk costs.  This is because the absolute level of propagation costs could be very low due to exponential technological improvements.  Fees could therefore  be tiny compared to today, but still large relative to orphan risk costs.  Orphan risk could therefore be insignificant and centralisation pressure from orphan risk would also be insignificant.  In contrast Peter's idea of allowing orphan risk to drive the fee market, guarantees orphan risk costs are high compared to fee revenue, which locks in mining centralisation.


If all your blocks are ophaned your revenue is zero and nothing goes to PoW.  As the orphan risk increases it gradually gets worse and we are left with mining centralisation.  
I never said I fully agreed with Greg's "contribution" point, its just a way of looking at the situation.

We probably could reach consensus to do this, if large companies like Coinbase put their weight behind it.  However instead Coinbase support the excessive BIP101 idea, which will not get consensus.

thanks for your comments
You mention investors staying away, please try to keep two things in perspective, one is generating investment demand and the other is generating real value over the long term.  These are two different things and I hope we can focus more on delivering real value.
I admit I may not be the most experienced investor, but I try to learn from experienced and successful investors.  One thing I have learnt is to always look for cautious and negative management teams, which are always looking for threats.  Its good to invest when the management team is absolutely paranoid.  This is in contrast two management teams focusing on growth.  In my view, long term success is driven by paranoia and  the successful mitigation or avoidance of downside risks.  Much of the Bitcoin core development team have attributes similar to these, and this is healthy and should be encouraged.
Despite what I said above, I do appreciate the criticism that some of the core devs are too academic and they have never delivered successful widely adopted products.  This is in contrast to who is focused on growth and the user experience, whilst at the same time Mike delivered services used by hundreds of millions of people at Google.
I appreciate both these points of view and what we need is collaboration and balance, rather than implementing excessive increases in BIP101 or failing to increase the blocksize at all.  Please join me in recognizing the value that these developers, with different characteristics bring to the system, and try to ensure collaboration and compromise.

With the right measures in place, if miners use the first seen principle 0 conformation transactions can be used in some circumstances.  This is not perfect but should be fine in many cases.  This does not mean Satoshi's invention is worthless.  The blockchain provides a far higher level of resiliance to double spends.  
Reversibility is not often a problem for credit cards either, credit cards may work 98% of the time, blockchain tries to be more reliable.
This is also analagous to the banking system that works over 99.9% of the time and is very useful, this also does not make Satoshi's invention worthless.  Bitcoin aims to be more reliable than banks and improve the 99.9%.
Steps merchants could take when accsepting zero conf payments:
1. Low maximum transaction value
2. Trusted/known/registerd customers only
3. ID required
4. Use a well connected node and wait 5 seconds to test for conflicting transactions
5. Install security cameras
6. Payment channels
7. Green address multisig idea
8. Reversible merchandise only. E.g. subscriptions, tickets, rent, even a house sale ect
9. Communication channel with miners

Someone else does need to run a node.  Otherwise there is only one miner.  Please tell me how many nodes you run?

 &gt; Because there are other decentralizing factors that balance these out. The extent to which mining centralizes depends on all factor--not just a single factor. 
Please name one way high orphan risk causes decentralisation of miners?
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:43:25


No, there is a difference, it does matter probabilistically.  If an orphan occurs that would have been an extra block and contribution to increasing the difficulty.  If a miner does work but never finds a block, it wouldn't effect the difficulty anyway.  Statistically it all balances out and a higher orphan rate reduces the network difficulty/security.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:40:16
This is why we need a functional fee market reasonably soon
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:43:52


These gross orphan risk costs are already higher than fees.  Which is not currently a problem as we have the block reward.  We need to let technologal advances reduce absolute orphan risk and relative orphan risk, or Bitcoin could fail.


This goes back to my experience in mining and how industry incentives can change.  My point is a majority of miners will maximise short term cashflow at some points in the cycle.  I appreciate this is difficult to see.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:48:32
The reality is of course it is ultimately there will be a vote, by miners.  The most work chain will always win and the miners will prove they are more powerful than the subreddit, the developers, full node operators, merchants and the exchanges combined.  None of the other groups will ever be able to challenge the most work chain, in my view.  Meni's "economic majority" idea is looking less likley as this debate unfolds.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:46:49
How does keeping the limit down improve a miners market share?  If anything larger blocks increase mining centralisation.
Under BIP 100 miners vote to increase revenue
Also fees may not need to increase.  Miners could vote on a limit increase to reduce fees.
Revenue = average fees * transaction volume * FX rate.  Miners may vote for larger blocks to increase volume and price.  BIP 100 is therefore a balanced proposal.

Yes I know Satoshi obviously did not invent either secp256k1 or secp256r1, the k in the curve name stands for the guy who came up with curve, Koblitz.
I think this could be interesting nethertheless, depending on how this system worked in the late 1990s.  If transactions were signed using ECDSA and then added to a central Paypal database, this is very interesting.  If it was based on secp256k1 that would be even more remarkable.  Although I dont know how this Paypal system worked, and usage of secp256k1 is probablly unlikely.

This could be a large issue.  Variations in demand by time, for example a Christmas rush could cause large delays in the network during peak hours.  At the same time mining power could vary by time, for example what if there are large solar mining facilities in one region and when the sun sets the hash rate falls. Network capacity could vary by the time of day.  If this network grows these could become major issues.

Why is it not O(1) if miners are acting in their own self interest?  If miners find a block they want other miners to begin working on it ASAP and therefore would like other miners to be able to reconstruct the block.  In the same way, miners will want to reconstruct blocks from IBLT blocks so they are working on the longest chain.  The proposal seems reasonably consitent with mining incentives to me.
Please explain why self interested may not want to impliment this?

People in the Bitcointalk forum asked for a high resolution copy of the front page. I then decided to take the paper to the scanners and obtain a high resolution copy. Following your advice I kept the full resolution version private. In exchange for Bitcoin donations, I made the lower resolution version available.

Peter, I agree with you here, this doesn’t  completely solve the blocksize problem.  Prior to this proposal I thought that block propagation times incentivising mining centralisation was one of the network's biggest security issues.  I think this proposal could help significantly with this.  Maybe this does tip the balance slightly in favour of a moderate increase in the blocksize limit, however there are still many reasons for a limit overall.
These reasons include:
1.	Bandwidth limits, as the transactions still need to be relayed and downloaded at least once
2.	Issues surrounding new nodes catching up with the network
3.	The need for scarcity in the blockchain to create a market price for transaction fees, which will prevent spam and eventually be required to incentivise miners
4. Storage limits
5. Fast propagation times in the event IBLT block reconstruction fails, due to a deliberate attack or pure accident
I am sure you can think of many more reasons for the limit.

Please can you try to elaborate on your first point a bit more? Why is this any different from a traditional selfish mining type of attack when a large miner finds a block but doesn’t propagate right away? Are the dynamics fundamentally different under this proposed IBLT approach? Why does faster block propagation make this attack any more likely?
Does this give an extra tool to selfish miners trying to hold blocks back? For example, could a selfish miner deliberately include recent transactions which not all miners would have in the meme pool, it would then take other miners more time to reconstruct, giving the selfish miner a slight advantage in finding the next block. Some miners would have the recent transactions, meaning the 30% of hashing power can be reached. This doesn’t seem to be clear to me, but I think there could be some selfish mining attack vectors which IBLT could make more attractive. I just can’t think of them.
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:08:51
I see your point, relatively "bad" propagation could be technically easier to achieve under IBLT and miners could potentially control how bad the propagation is, using “variably poor propagation” to calibrate any selfish mining attack.
Remember this proposal appears to reduce the risks of centralised mining overall, as it reduces the comparative advantage of miners being located near each other as block propagation times are reduced.
Overall, on balance I still think this could be a great idea. However there are many important issues and attack vectors to consider, as you suggest.

Yes, part of the same Bitcoin Unlimited philosophy is that Bitcoin relies on a sort of Emergent Consensus anyway.
Rather than merely relying on math, code or protocol, many really see Bitcoin as a consensus between people first and foremost. People choose to partake in the system, people give it value, and sometimes — like during the August 2010 and March 2013 blockchain forks — people have to coordinate “off-chain” to determine which chain is valid.
As such, BUIP001 doesn’t fundamentally change anything. Users choose to run Bitcoin Unlimited. Node software can already be (re-)compiled. And a social consensus may have to form “off-chain” either way.
But by making this control more explicit and easier to handle, and assuming users actually use these options, Bitcoin Unlimited does rely on the human consensus aspect to a much larger extent. Rather than opting into a protocol once and relying on machine consensus from then on, users need to take on a much more proactive role. As one Bitcoin Unlimited proponent noted, shortly after miners had to reconfigure their nodes in response to a bug that briefly forked the network earlier this week: **“This IS part of how Bitcoin works. It’s not meant for people sleeping at the wheel.”**
It is true that BUIP001 doesn’t introduce anything that wasn’t possible before. As an open-source project, users and miners could always recompile their Bitcoin software to do anything that Bitcoin Unlimited allows. But of course, that in itself is not an argument in favor of BUIP001. Just because users could, that does not mean they should.
So far, Bitcoin has had several forks that lasted for several blocks, caused by technical failures. The August 2010 blockchain fork was needed to revert the creation of billions of bitcoins out of thin air, which required orphaning an hour-long chain. The only reason that the event wasn’t catastrophic is that bitcoin was hardly used as money back then. During the March 2013 blockchain fork, however, the network was unreliable for real users, and at least one person was double-spent, while several miners wasted valuable resources mining an orphaned chain. The same is true for the July 2015 blockchain fork, where miners were urged to switch to fully validating mining pools, and many have learned from that mistake.
Indeed, developers, miners and the rest of the Bitcoin community have generally tried to avoid these types of crisis events as much as they possibly can.  In contrast, Bitcoin Unlimited seems to embrace them as an upgrade mechanism.

If that is true, why doesn't Coinbase use "blockchain technology" for its internal ledger of customer balances?  One would think bitcoin companies would be the first to do this.
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:46:22
What about Coinbase's diverse group of customers across the world using Coinbase for off chain transactions, often interacting with each other.  The VISA network is way too large and complex to try something like this.  Coinbase is already using blockchain as do its customers.  The reason they don't is because it makes no technical sense, it's just classic over engineering.

This is a great essay and succinctly explains the core fundamental problem with Bitcoin Unlimited’s “Emergent Consensus” system.  Bitcoin Unlimited changes the security model, such that it requires human intervention to actively monitor and modify various software parameters (namely MG, EB and AD).  This human (or [bird]( like) process has all the normal pitfalls and inefficiencies of traditional social scalability.  The key (and only) innovation of Bitcoin is “automated security”, that does not require this human intervention:
As Nick describes it:






@_date: 2017-02-09 05:24:31


Well there are two angles to that.  One is the human ideology  angle, some people seem to agree with you and some disagree.
The other angle is how nodes actually behave.  In this case, nodes actually  do enforce validity and do not follow a longer chain if it breaks the rules.
The fact that one group as an opinion more consistent with how nodes behave, may mean they are mostly correct....
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:42:47
  
Classic has its own alternative idea, that is incompatible with BU.  It is similar to BU without AD.
Bitcoin Classic's evolution seems to be as follows:
* Hardfork to 2MB, with new sig ops limit
* New 2nd version of Classic, incompatible with the previous one - 2MB without sigops limit
* New 3rd version of Classic, incompatible with the previous one - Alternative block-size idea, with a complicated "punishment score" mechanism, depending on how large the block is, with a variable proof of work score requirement.  For example a 2.2MB block on a 2MB local customizable  limit is 10% punishment. There is then a factor and an offset making the formula  factor * punishment + 0.5. Where factor is a local customizable  setting.  (Source: 
* New 4th version of Classic, incompatible with the previous one - Like BU, except without AD, making Classic incompatible with BU (Source: 
Despite these all being incompatible with each other, I still think they have the same flag.

If nodes single their acceptance by changing EB, this opens up the "median EB attack" vector, where a malicous miners mines a block with a size equal to the middle of these signalled values, to split the network into two groups.
Whenever I mention this attack, BU supporters say that this is fine as the signalling won't be used.  You BU guys cannot have it both ways, you can't say the signalling is an advantage but also cannot be used.
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:17:11

It is a huge issue...  You could be a merchant and accept an order on 10 confirmations, only to find out there was another longer chain, in the lead with 11 confirmations and then this 11 becomes 12 and now your incoming payment is gone.
If everyone has the same EB, BU is pointless anyway, so why bring this up?


This is a fundamentally different concept to normal orphaning:




We did 2MB with SegWit and BU continued....
Also your logic is stupid, you are saying because you tried at a reasonable thing which failed, you are now trying a flawed and dangerous thing?  How can reasonable people negotiate with that madness.  


Core just did that.  SegWIt is 2MB blocks....


No, it is correct.  Nodes do not NEED to upgrade more than every few years.  Of course we can do a fast upgrade in some circumstances IF nodes quickly upgrades, but they do not NEED it.  That is why we use 95% thresholds.
However BU has the philosophy were it is like driving at the wheel.  We need as a community to unite against this, which makes Bitcoin have all the pitfalls of traditional consensus, where we eventually need police, lawyers, compliance, auditors ect ect to make it work.  Please join me in opposing BU.


We can do a hardfork in a safe way, giving users time to upgrade....


I agree.  I think many implementations make the rules more resilient and therefore support more implementations.  For example Bitcoin Core, BTCD ect.  For example a hardfork would require agreement from the development teams of ALL significant implementations.
Please note BU is NOT a Bitcoin implementation.  All BU does is create a new coin, that happens to be flawed.
 
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:20:46


BU only does this with respect to the blocksize and if AD thresholds are breached.  
BU still enforces other non blocksize related  validity rules  
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:22:09


This is a nice and helpful definition, but we also need to be pragmatic.  In principal it would be great if we could all agree on a definition and that we could always have strong "social consensus" on the chain.  This social process and idea of what Bitcoin is, is very important.  However, what our local node says is Bitcoin, it also very important.  If our local node disagrees with this social idea, we have an actual practical problem, denying the existence of this problem is not helpful, in my view.  Social consensus on Bitcoin without a working implementation, has no actual practical use case.  Therefore when deciding “what Bitcoin is”, what is implemented in software is clearly also an important part of the dynamic.  For Bitcoin to work, we may need both a social idea AND an implementation in software.
Unfortunately the world is not perfect.  There are some occasions when people may have a different view.  Just because this is the opinion of Gavin does not mean everyone will share it.  I understand many people do not like the blocksize limit and would like to see it removed.  However, other people do want the limit and it is an important part of the system to them.  In my view, the people who do not want to limit should be more open minded and try to appreciate that the limit is important to some people and that the people who think the limit is important, may in some circumstances, behave differently than those who do not like the limit.  For example people who support the blocksize limit may continue on a shorter chain if a longer chain removes the limit, this social behavior also happens to be consistent with how the overwhelming majority of nodes on the network actually behave, which is also an important factor.
This is one of the reasons “machine consensus” is preferable in many circumstances, as it is less susceptible to the disagreements humans tend to have.  At scale, human disagreements are likely to become more prevalent, while over time, the software may become more reliable.  Therefore, over time it may become necessary to gradually shift the weight of importance to “machine consensus” from “social consensus”, while still recognizing that both are important.
There is a model that the rules of the system implemented in software, do not change, unless there is broad consensus across the entire community.  There is clearly not universal agreement that this is the best model and this model is far from perfect.  However, the reason I support this model, which Bitcoin Core seems to follow, is due to the process of elimination argument.  I cannot think of any viable alternatives.  I think this model is the only one that has a chance of working, at scale, in an adversarial environment.
In addition to this, at least in the short term, “machine consensus”, is faster, more reliable, more robust, more neutral and a more efficient system than “social consensus”. Relying on humans to interpret a definition and agree on that definition, in a live environment, where money is at stake, in a timely manner, is not likely to be robust or reliable.

Please could you ask some more questions to the exchanges that say they would run BU. For example the following question may be good:
 * What EB and AD settings will your exchange use?
 * Will the EB and AD setting be publicly view-able to users of the exchange?  Or will they be kept private?
 * Will the terms and conditions state the AD and EB settings and will the exchange have the right to change them at any time?
* Has analysis been conducted of the risks of setting the AD or EB figures too low or too high?
BU is a new type of node, you cant just run it like the existing implementation, you need to actively decide on certain parameters which could decide what chain the exchange is on. The exchange will then be required to actively monitor these settings.
Another good question for exchanges operating with BU could be:
* How many confirmations the exchange would require for deposits and how will this compare to the local AD setting?
According to BU advocates, accepting an incoming transaction before AD confirmations is not advised, as for example there could exists a longer chain than this already so the payment would be very insecure. The current recommended AD value is 12, does this mean users would need to wait for 13 confirmations before their deposits are available to use on the exchange?
The BU "Sticky gate" could also be an important issue for exchanges:
Please ask:
* Will your exchange operate normally when the exchange's sticky gate is open or will trading, deposits and withdrawals be suspended?
* Will users be warned that the sticky gate is open?

Of course, “orphaned blocks” do already exist, and users that require more security should wait for more confirmations.
But barring exotic and expensive types of malicious attacks, three orphaned blocks can currently really only result from freak coincidence. Different groups of miners must coincidentally find three blocks at almost exactly the same time, three separate and subsequent coincidences, in order for the network to experience that many orphans.
Bitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, throws a new factor into the mix, adding a reason for the network to experience three orphaned blocks. Miners not only race to extend the longest valid chain, but also vote on protocol rules between chains. This process would also be visible and quite predictable for attackers, and therefore easily exploitable.
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:38:52


Maybe a general disadvantage of softforks is that new rules can be imposed on people and there is no opt out.  However, in the case of SegWit this disadvantage is not really applicable, since nobody is currently breaching the new rules that SegWit would enforce

They do  not want to let the market to decide, that is why they have not forked.
They only want the market to decide if they think they will definitely win.  Which of course is not really letting the market decide at all.

The mechanism used to signal preferences in BU is fundemtally flawed and dangerous.  In BU, nodes set there own blocksize limit, this means a malicous miner can create a block with a size equal to the middle value of everyones individual limit, to split the network into two groups, on seperate chains, at any point in time. This is just one of many critical problems with BU 
Yes, the BU philosophy sounds nice, but the mechanism they use to implement that philosophy in code is ridiculously broken.
When I point this out to BU advocates they say, "Oh, well the signalling won't be used them".  Right, so I guess BU does not let participants signal then...

Unlike Bitcoin Unlimited, this is an **independent** Bitcoin implementation, therefore it does not contain code written by Bitcoin Core.  In contrast many Blockstream employees have written a huge amount of the code in BU.  This software is also segwit ready

I dont think Bitcoin protocol development may be a good area for you to focus on then.  Bitcoin is about being very robust and the community needs to be paranoid about all potential security vulnerabilities.


How is that an effective stance?  If Core doesnt do what we want, we will screw up the system for everyone?  That is a bad and irresponsible position.

Bitcoin on deposit at a bank, or perhaps 2nd layer technologies like payment channels...
Lower case "bitcoin" the unit can still be for day to day, if we can get upper case "Bitcoin" to scale enough for day to day onchain transactions is an open question.   I used to think we could scale Bitcoin onchain a lot, but it will take a lot of hard work and innovation, however the recent failure to get SegWit through makes me rethink if we can change Bitcoin that much, so unfortunately mass onchain scaling may not be possible.
But I still do not think we should give up yet.  There are still a lot of technologies we can build on top of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:45:44
Classic has its own alternative idea, that is incompatible with BU.  It is similar to BU without AD.
Bitcoin Classic's evolution seems to be as follows:
* Hardfork to 2MB, with new sig ops limit
* New 2nd version of Classic, incompatible with the previous one - 2MB without sigops limit
* New 3rd version of Classic, incompatible with the previous one - Alternative block-size idea, with a complicated "punishment score" mechanism, depending on how large the block is, with a variable proof of work score requirement.  For example a 2.2MB block on a 2MB limit is 10% punishment. There is then a factor and an offset making the formula  factor * punishment + 0.5. Where factor is a local setting.  (Source: 
* New 4th version of Classic, incompatible with the previous one - Like BU, except without AD, making Classic incompatible with BU (Source: 
Despite these all being incompatible with each other, I still think they have the same flag.

20MB with or without automatic increases? If it's without, I may follow you, otherwise I think it's prudent to stick with the other 80% of the devs.

So you are happy introducing a 1% attack vector.  This will make Bitcoin extremely weak.  Do you really think nobody will want to attack it?  Remeber a miner with 0.1% could do this attack on average, once per week.
That is the problem with the BU mentality.  BU supporters look for 99.9% uptime and then they think that is fine.  They do not realize that this is money, money that screws up 0.1% of the time (once per week), is very very bad money
@_date: 2017-02-11 04:01:48

Of course I operate nodes...


Whoever the people/organisations that operate the nodes are, they would need to upgrade for a hardfork and they would also need to upgrade to get the benefits of SegWit


No it does not.  It just means they need to upgrade.  In the same way individual users "consciously choose" to use Hierarchical Deterministic addresses.


And after that occurs, you can get the benefits of SegWit.  All you would need to do is upgrade


BU on the other had would be a much bigger change, people would need to set and monitor AD and EB settings...

Yes it does, it literally means there is a known issue where Classic and BU can be on separate chains to each other.   This is a case of incompatibility.

That dramatically undermines the whole point of the system....


Why not just increase the blocksize limit without this emergent consensus stuff?


Perhaps, but the safety checks ensure that  if nodes do not upgrade, then the system still works.  If everyone upgrades quickly we get a short cut upgrade, if not, then we need to wait a few years

One of the best methods of bringing down a distributed system, it to centralise it.  I would recommend the government take the following actions:
* Centralise core development – Offer grants to core developers.  Invite core developers to government conferences, with high fees and paid for accommodation in 5 star hotels.  Give them free office space and staff.
* Centralise mining – Offer tax incentives to miners if they operate in particular regions.  Subsidise mining electricity costs.  Give grants to R&amp;D investments in mining technology
* Centralise merchants/businesses – Create Bitcoin economic zones where businesses and merchant adoption is encouraged or subsidised
* Centralise the full nodes – Offer cloud node hosting services at subsidised prices
* Centralise investment – Encourage institutional investment in bitcoin, by offering clear regulation which encourages investment.  Offer tax advantages.
Then once the network is sufficiently centralised, associate the system with terrorism, drugs, porn or crime and then criminalise development, mining, operating nodes, being a Bitcoin business, holding coins or even using the network.  Then use the full extent of the law and government powers to prosecute the various relevant entities, which should now be within reach.
However the above strategy is somewhat counterintuitive and typically governments do not have enough experience in taking down distributed systems.

No any new outputs will be redeemed by segregating the witness.  Most HD wallets only have one output now anyway.




Well it's strictly faster than a hardfork 


If would be great if nodes did do that automatically.  However that is not BU.  BU is a manual version
This automatic idea is the exact opposite of BU and making it manual is exactly why BU is flawed. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 00:52:16


Not that it technically matters, but SegWit is also a literal blocksize limit increase aswell
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:14:10


BU has not been accsepted by the community, so the incentive to attack is not there.  If BU was used by the miners, it would cause chaos.  One miner would just create a block of median EB value, and then split the hasharte 50/50.  The network could then be down for several hours and many users could lose funds as a result of double spend attacks, the integrity of the system would then take a huge hit.
On a side note:
1. Actually I do not think they are running higher EB
2. BU did recently create an invalid block


What we are saying is users should not make their nodes incompatible, nobody is claiming you are not "allowed" to
It is just like me telling you you should not jump of a cliff, and then you responding by saying "no, I am ALLOWED to jump of a cliff". Whether one should do something and whether one is ALLOWED to, are different things


No we are not.  The developers cannot change the consensus rules.  That is not how Bitcoin works.

You are considering the spam attack from one very narrow angle, of filling a block. And besides filling up a block is not really an attack anyway, as Satoshi said:
At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the other customers
Source: 
Please note Satoshi used the word customers, not even spammers
What about another more realistic spammer aim of "blocking" some absolute number or certain percentage of transactions? Or the more serious aim of spamming the blockchain or UTXO, which is a permanent issue? What about an attack transaction with too many spam signatures to verify? These more realistic and serious attacks become much cheaper and more damaging as the blocksize limit increases.

But miners do have elevated power, in that 51% of miners can impose a softfork on the community, even if others do not want it.
In a sense, the SegWit signalling/voting is binding in **one direction**.  The signalling to activate SegWit by the miners is binding.
In contrast, miners can not impose a hardfork on the community.

The median EB attack requires one miner to find one block once, that is a much lower threshold than the majority of miners


No, EB is different than just signalling.  EB of say 2MB actually no longer enforces the 1MB limit and enforces 2MB.  If you want it to be just signalling like a conversation in public, then let's change it to just signalling then, and nobody will have a problem 


SW SF has safety mechanisms built in like a 95% miner threshold and it's only a softfork so won't create two coins if of a minority of miners upgrade 


This is not Nakamoto consensus.  Nakamoto consensus decides between competing valid chains.  Nakamoto consensus only has doubt about the true chain when a rare coincidence happens and two blocks are found at the same time.  The BU  has doubt as to the true chain in all kinds of scenarios, for example if a block larger than my local EB is in the lead, that has not crossed my AD threshold yet

You seem to be unhappy with the SegWit roadmap though, just because it doesn't "absolutely" promise to do an HF afterwards, which by the way will have almost no additional impact on capacity. (1.9MB to 2.1MB)  Why cause so much division over 200KB?
@_date: 2016-03-11 07:16:14
Core could not do a hard fork to BIP103 during an attack.  If they did that the network could split into three.  The priority was to defeat the attack by sticking together, not dividing the community who was already opposed to XT, otherwise XT could have won.  Its game theory.
I asked Core devs to do a hard fork to 2MB during the XT attack and they explained to me why it was not possible, which was because they didn't want to split up when unity against XT was the priority.

We use the JustGiving API. We control the Bitcoin sent to these addresses which we allocated to 10,000 charities.

This attacker only needs to find one block once, yes this attack can result in a big mess, lowering the value of the system and costing the attacker funds.  However, this is a fundamental change in security model, at present c40% to c51% of miners need to waste a lot of money to cause a mess and chaos on the network.  With this BU EB mechaninism, the attacker needs to only find one block, which can be done once per week with c0.1% of the hashrate.  This is a much cheaper way to attack that it is now.

No.  I'm saying Classic supporters are supposed to run Classic now and wait for miners to activate it.  My Core nodes to not recognise the Classic activation.  The fact that after 28 days the majority of nodes are not looking for the activation implies one of two things:
1. The majority are against Classic (most likely) ; or
2. The majority do support Classic, but require more time to upgrade their node
Therefore one thing we can all agree on is that 28 days is too short

How do you think buses, planes and taxis actually work? Most of these are not free, otherwise they wouldn't exist.  You may want free transport but that would clog up the system and be inefficient.  More efficient organisations like airlines make customers outbid each other to get on planes! This is just what Satoshi described for Bitcoin blocks. 


I just explained that the Bitcoin fee is very low therefore I still pay enough to get my non urgent transactions in the next block.  If the fees increase further I will wait a few blocks.   That is not frustrating at all.

Gavin you have said this to me a few times.  I think this is probably true with respect to one or two of the most extreme less prominent Core devs.  However, when I went to both scaling conferences and then to the HK "consensus roundtable" most developers including the most prominent ones seemed willing to compromise.  The Core devs there seemed happy with 2MB but wanted a longer grace period and higher activation threshold.
Didn't Pieter, Wladimir and Gmaxwell support and propose BIP103, only for you to reject it?  BIP103 seemed reasonable to me and it has a larger increase than Classic.  It could have been adopted by now if you would have taken the opportunity to jump on this proposal, or even try to bring it forward a bit.

Sorry that was not clear, let me try to explain.  Our users donate bitcoin to one of over 10,000 bitcoin addresses in our database, each address is assigned to one charity.  We control and hold the private keys to those 10,000 addresses.  Within 24 hours of the donation being confirmed by the network, we promise to make a donation of equivalent value in pounds to the chosen charity.  Users only therefore only need to trust us for up to 24 hours.  As for the bitcoins, we plan to sweep them periodically and sell them to finance the donations, however at present we have cash in reserves.  In the unlikely event we lose the bitcoin private keys, we promise to use reserves to honor donations.  However of course security is a very important issue and we do not want to lose money.
I am currently doing this on my own account, however if this service is popular and over £1,000 or £2,000 is donated, I plan to register as a charity with the UK authorities, from that point the charity will have its own bank account.

BU requires active user participation from wallets, not just miners
Also the network went through a proper upgrade process to ensure the risk was minimized in the case you describe.  Softforks nowadays require a 95% miner threshold for safety to prevent these problems.
The process is now improving even further with BIP9, where miners are no longer required to upgrade for softforks

There is a possibility this happens, however this issue I bring up may prevent that occurring as miners who want Classic to lose still have hope of winning.  Especially because some miners may have a policy of flagging Classic support but not being willing to mine the first &gt;1MB block.


Please could you explain this a bit more, I do not follow why it is 0%.  Remember all Classic miners (100%) will build on top of &lt;1MB blocks, whilst only c75% will build on top of &gt;1MB blocks.  Therefore as soon at the &lt;1MB block chain has a lead, it wins.  In contrast as soon at the &gt;1MB block chain has a lead, it only has a c79% chance of winning.

You suggested that it's like the Internet where all packets are equal.  Instead transactions are not treated equally, ones with a higher fee are given priority.


Who said I want to force higher fees?  I do not, I hope fees can come down. I think a big problem with this debate is constant misrepresentation or misunderstanding. However the principal of transactions with higher fees being given priority is crucial, that does not imply increases in average fee levels.  It also certainly does not mean arbitrary increases in the fee level.

We have seen huge improvements in fee estimation technology recently. 
If your transaction is urgent set your wallet to the priority setting.   For me I leave the setting on normal, it has never cost more than 4p and it almost always gets in the next block.  I set it to normal even though transactions are non urgent.  If demand increases more then perhaps I'll switch to an economical setting.  This demonstrates the huge slack and spare capacity in the system

FSS-RBF is not practical 
Let me provide two examples:
Example 1
* New wallet set up with 1 BTC and one input
* User unable to use FSS-RBF
Example 2
* Wallet has two inputs, 0.5BTC and 0.4BTC
* User buys a coffee for 0.6BTC
* User unable to use FSS-RBF
One suggested idea is that when a wallet is installed, it immediately creates many transactions with many outputs waiting for use in FSS-RBF. However its unclear how many to make or what size the output should be. This will create many more transactions and damage scalability. Also the outputs will then be merged later on into transactions damaging privacy, as everything is traced back to the initial wallet set up.
As you can see how to manage wallets then becomes very difficult and is a trade off between between three factors:
* Ability to use FSS-RBF
* Privacy
* Resources/fees/scalability (e.g. UTXO bloat)
This makes creating and using a wallet very complicated and impractical. On balance I think this makes it clear that FSS-RBF is not the way to go.

But everyone else needs to verfiy the signatures and get the blocks propagated to them.  Therefore miners might not exercise the option to make smaller blocks, because they don't consider the costs born by others.

The market clears were supply = demand.  There is no such thing as one always being greater than the other in a free competitive market.  This is economics 101.


Yes, currently marginal orphan risk is sufficiently to cause a fee market, but you cant have it both ways.  Either one of the followin is true:
1. Marginal orphan risk cost is significant -&gt; larger locks increases centralization risk
2. Marginal orphan risk cost is insignificant -&gt; fees fall to low levels and security falls
What you are advocating is pushing centralization risk to the limit to drive the fee market.  I believe this is a catastrophic scenario for Bitcoin


It is good to be ambitious, but also realistic.  If you have that long term vision please recognize that won't be easy and it will take decades of hard work and difficult engineering.  That is why it is even more important to build a solid robust foundation now and not compromise that based on apparent short term factors


Nobody is saying that, currently the fee is very low and everyone is working hard on capacity upgrades.  Core has a road-map to nearly double capacity in a few months.


Nobody is killing PoS.  As I said, Opt-in RBF is a great help for PoS.


I am not saying give up on retail.  I am saying VISA has some tremendous insurmountable technical advantages when it comes to propagation speed, capacity and transaction cost.  It is important to be realistic and identify where Bitcoin is strong.  The permissionless innovation quality should help take on VISA.


FSS-RBF would be a good idea if it cannot work.  However it is simply impossible to implement because the network does not know which output is the change address, therefore it is not possible to implement.  That is why we should leave these decisions to technical experts.  Core tried to implement FSS-RBF but it was not possible.


They still are, there has been no material change to this.


Nobody wants to kill it.  Where did this idea come from?  What we need to do is educate businesses about the risks of zero conf and how to mitigate these risks.  For example Coinbase accepted a zero conf payment from me for a hotel stay in 2 months time, why would Coinbase do that when it is unecessary?  Zero conf technologies are constantly improving and being developed.

Retailers need to make decisions all the time, the following actions could be taken:
1. Ask for your ID
2. Wait 10 minutes for confirmation (a 5 cent fee is tiny compared to a $1,500 purchase)
3. Offer to deliver the item
4. Install security cameras
5. Allow the staff to exercise in-store judgement
6. Use a company to evaluate the transaction fee and provide an assessment of the likelihood of double spend
This is already a difficult issue with credit cards.  Bitcoin is likely to help with this relative to other payment options

I agree with you here.  But don't you see how this illustrates the importance of an economically relevant blocksize limit and having full blocks.  In order to avoid the debate about whether a particular use like Satoshi Dice is spam or legitimate we need a fee market.  We  need full blocks and for users to have to outbid other users to get on chain.  That way the most economically valuable transactions to the user get on  chain and all transactions are legitimate.

As I keep explaining, this makes no sense.  When a market clears Supply = Demand, that is how markets work.  Please read an economics textbook.


This logic is false for many reasons:
1. Block propagation costs are currently high and significant, this will come down to insignificant levels as technology improves
2. The mining industry is highly centralized
3. Demand is low and immature as Bitcoin is a new niche product
4. The fee market has been inefficient 


I agree that it would be good for supply capacity to increase as demand increases.  However, unlike you I **do care** how it is done as its a highly complicated issue and important to get it as good as we can.  Just because you don't care how it is done, please respect those who do, and allow them the time and the space to move forward.  I support BIP100 as a dynamic market driven capacity adjustment mechanism.  I also support 2MB (as explained its the 75% activation threshold I do not like)


I think they are great.


Thin blocks do not remove **any** issues no.  This is a complex system.  However I think Thin Blocks are great and that miners use them and this allows us to increase the blocksize.


I keep repeating, I support BIP100 and I support a 2MB blocksize limit now.  Everybody wants scaling and everybody wants capacity increases.  I think you have misunderstood the other side of the argument.  The debate is about when and how to increase capacity.  For example many people are very strongly opposed to Classic's activation methodology.




But how do people know which is the change output?  If your answer is to flag it as a change output, that is exactly equivalent what opt in RBF is!  You just described Opt in RBF.


Again, I feel this line of argument misrepresents the other side and causes more animosity.  Everyone wants high volumes and low fees.

Because all nodes need to upgrade not just miners.  Classic has a 28 day grace period and launched around 28 days ago.  However only around 18% of nodes are Classic nodes.  This is clear evidence the 28 day grace period was far too short.

Can that always easily be done:
* What if the Softfork is done in secret so you do not know what the new rules are?

@_date: 2016-01-05 12:49:28
How can you pay if there is no payment request? The payment terminal needs some mechanism to transmit details, like the address, amount, RBF rules ect, to the wallet. 
A  lot of this dispute is about a different vision for Bitcoin.  Perhaps you are thinking about payments today.  I am thinking Bitcoin is at least many years away from large scale point of sale usage,  I think there are a lot of changes, hard work and improvements that need to occur before that point, so that it works seamlessly with existing point of sale systems.
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:11:40


 Stephen's point is that orphan risk will be high enough to prevent miners making blocks too big.  We would therefore be relying on orphan risk to prevent fees falling to zero.  This means we have a problem however large the orphan risk is in absolute terms.  Therefore relying on orphan risk to manage blockspace is a bad idea.

Nobody is arguing for 100% consensus.  The decision does not need to be unanimous.  It just needs no significant opposition.  One or two people alone are not significant.  In this case we have split the community almost right down the middle and there is clearly significant opposition.

is a private web forum where one person is in charge of the moderation policy.  Everyone agrees the moderation has not been great and should have been better.  However, why do people blame the whole small block side or even the existing consensus rules, for the moderation policy of one person?  I have been debating this issue on and   I understand how the moderation policy can be counterproductive and many users want to prove Theymos wrong.  I get the Streisand effect and how this impacts people on the Internet.  Many internet users and parts of the Bitcoin community like the Streisand effect and want to prove it works by demonstrating that censorship is counterproductive.  For example viewing some Wikipedia page ( inappropriately flagged for child pornography or viewing that photo of Barbra Streisand's house.  I get that, its funny and it proves a point.  I feel people have adopted this same attitude to deciding on Bitcoin's consensus rules.  I apologies, but Bitcoin's consensus rules are far more important than these things, they must be decided on technical merit and only changed with strong consensus.  I am determined not to let politics, the Streisand effect or a reaction to moderation policy impact the consensus rules of Bitcoin.
I have always said could have done much better and was too harsh with the moderation policy.  However he had a very difficult job.  The policy was not aimed at banning or preventing discussion on the blocksize.  The banning was about banning advocation of an attack on the network.  XT was considered an attack as its aim was to do a contentious hard fork.  This appears to go right to the core of the issue and is what we were discussing above.  I appreciate you do not see preventing a contentious hard fork as crucial or core to Bitcoin's value proposition, and therefore you do not see XT as an attack. However, all I ask is that you recognize that very significant proportion of the community does think this way, including a lot of the intellectual capital in the community and that you respect those people and therefore negotiate and compromise.  Please stop the advocation of a contentious hard fork for now, when half the community will oppose it purely on the ground's its contentious anyway, what is the point?
Can we agree on these two points:
 * Some of the harsh aspects of the moderation policy were counterproductive
 * XT and Classic were counterproductive in achieving larger blocks.
Lets stop the counterproductive things and be productive...

No this is not correct.  Drawing from multiple inputs makes the fees higher, that is different from addresses.  If you send two different transactions to the same address and then later you want to spend all the money, you will still have two inputs, even though the money is from the same address.
Also is correct.
Do not reuse addresses, you sacrifice privacy and security, and at the same time you do not make fees lower.  Lower fees caused by address reuse is a misconception.  (Unless anyone has an idea how this could reduce fees that I have not thought of)
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:14:59
You are considering the spam attack from one very expensive narrow angle, which is blocking all transactions.  This attack is unfeasibly expensive anyway.  Increasing the blocksize limit may increase the cost of this unrealistic attack, but it also increases the damage the attacker  causes.
What about another more realistic spammer aim of blocking some absolute number or certain percentage of transactions?  Or the more serious aim of spamming the blockchain or UTXO, which is a permanent issue?  What about an attack transaction with too many spam signatures to verify?  These more realistic attacks become much cheaper and more damaging as the blocksize limit increases.
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:21:35
Let's at least start with competing compatible implementations 
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:14:24
No.  In order to block the transactions the spammer needs to outbid the users, this is true for any blocksize limit.  
We must not keep increasing the limit too much and allow any spammer to fill up all the blocks for such a low fee
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:40:26


Exactly.  Demand is a function of price and demand is therefore not always below capacity.  That is my point.  It seems you are getting it.  However later in the comment you refer to full blocks again.


No I am not.  I am assuming a fee market driven by marginal orphan risks necessarily causes centralization.  This is because it necessarily implies orphan risk is significant in relation to mining revenue.  This means its a significant cost.  If you have 40% of the hashpower you only need to propagate to 60% of the network, if you have 1% you need to propagate to the remaining 99%.  This implies orphan risk costs helps larger miners relative to smaller one.


 I think storage costs are almost totally irrelevant in relation to block propagation issues.  I haven't even thought about the storage problem as I think its relatively unimportant.


As a explained aove, demand is a function of price. Therefore full blocks is not a valid concept.


FSS-RBF is totally unworkable.  As I explained the network does not know which output is the change output.  Therefore its impossible without adding a new input each time, wallets don't have the spare inputs.  If you solve this I will change my mind in an instant and support FSS-RBF.


If you can write FSS-RBF it will be implemented.  Simple as that, its just that it cannot be done.  By expert I mean anyone that can write FSS-RBF


Yes exactly, if you outbid other users you are included.  Could not agree more.

You mean the existing consensus rules?


So using JToomim's numbers Gavin went back to miners and said let's do 2MB now and deal with the rest later. Miners said that sounds good. Gavin builds Classic, and still miners aren't switching.
Miners and the community are probably happy with a 2MB limit, in my view.  Therefore we could go to 2MB.  However this is not why miners are not switching to Classic.  The reason miners are sticking with the existing consensus rules is the highly contentious activation method in Classic.  In particular the 75% activation threshold and small one month grace period.  A majority of he hashing power even stated they would support Classic if a 90% threshold is chosen, however Gavin chose not to respond to concerns of miners and others.  If a 95% figure was chosen the miners would have already switched.  The problem with a 75% threshold is its not even possible for Classic to activate on 95%, as soon as 75% is reached, Classic activates.  This has driven people like me to strongly oppose Classic, even though I am fine with a 2MB limit.


1. HF's cannot be done by Core alone
2. Core are likely to implement code for a HF to increase the limit in July 2016


Ok, I hereby acknowledge this can be considered be a new thing


Improvements in this area have been rapidly occurring.  Wallets without some form of fee estimation technology are now largely redundant


I do not want demand to drop.  I just want people to accept the fact that that demand is a function of price.  Hopefully we can have low prices, high demand and high volume.  The crucial thing to me is that volume * price increases.  Almost everyone shares the vision that volume should grow and prices should be low.  The disagreement is about accepting the fact that we need full blocks for the system to function.  Your mistake is that you think people who want a fee market want the fee to be high, that is not true.  I think we can have a working fee market and lower fees than today.




I thought Gavin said that.
Let me repeat again:
**Why have we just done two soft forks with a 95% threshold?**
This theory is unlikely to be a problem anyway.  I keep thinking the advocates of 75% just do not get mining incentives.  Core to the design of the system is **that miners want to stick together above all else**, do you not get this?  Once 75% of miners flag support for Classic, getting the remaining 25% will be ludicrously easy.  Imagine if 95% goes one way and 5% goes the other way, the pressure on the 5% to switch will be tremendous, that is how the system works, the miners need to stick together.  This is why a 95% threshold will win and why miners are not switching to Classic now.


The target time will still be 10 minutes


No, I am not interest in this.   Please stop misrepresenting my position.  **I am interested in coins in a chain where the existing rules cannot change without strong consensus.**  Core is just a particular implementation that tries to be consistent with the existing rules. To me the principal of the existing rules not changing without strong consensus is nothing to do with Core.

@_date: 2016-03-01 12:00:26
That is because Bitcoin is a new, small, niche technology without a clear use case.  If this changes and Bitcoin is successful and has a strong use case,  demand will be almost unbounded at a low enough fee.  This has already happend to some extent as Satoshi Dice and similiar businesses were priced out of the market.  This is like how demand for iPhones or Mercedes will be extremely high if the price was 1 cent.  Once a normal demand curve develops blocks will always be full.

Under this flexcap idea, if a miner mines a larger block with 10% more work requirement, does that count as 10% more work for the most work chain calculation?

Well I do want change to 2MB.  Therefore no it isn't 
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:51:34
I will try to respond in four sections:
**1 - Consistency with mining incentives**
I appreciate that this point can be difficult to fully grasp.  What we are discussing here is RBF which is a policy with respect to how nodes relay transactions and how miners construct blocks.  This policy is outside of the consensus rules as nodes can relay what they like and miners can construct blocks how they like, in the context of RBF.  Miners and nodes are not required to follow these rules, they are more like suggestions. 
Bitcoin is entirely voluntary, there are no people enforcing the rules, in order for the system to be robust users should be able to act in their own self interest and yet because of the clever design of the system, it still works.  That is the core principle of Bitcoin and what Bitcoin aims to achieve, consensus and order without authority.  This is what is quite unique about Bitcoin compared to any other systems, as traditionally there has been a choice between having a central authority or having disorder, Bitcoin aims to solve this dilemma.
The idea is that RBF is a consistent policy with respect to what miners would do if they acted selfishly and in the absence of any authority.  This is is because RBF allows miners to maximise their short term profits in some scenarios, by switching to include transactions with higher fees.  Therefore we should switch to RBF now, as eventually miners will adopt it anyway.
This viewpoint is controversial.  Many argue calculating miners self interest is a difficult thing to do, because it may be in miners interests to help the system and protect 0 conf, as a healthier system will increase Bitcoin's value and improve long term mining earnings.  The truth is there is no right answer to this, each miner will have their own profitability and expected economic life and therefore a unique calculation.  It also depends on the miners share of the global hashrate, if a miner has a 20% share then its likely to find more blocks in the future and care about the long term interests of the system.  If a miner has a 0.1% share, why should it care about the long term interests of the system, instead this miner could let others worry about the system? This miner may apply RBF to maximise their own short term profits.  
In my view the mining industry will change over time, sometimes a majority of miners will play the long term game and other times the shorter term game.  However, I think we should try to design the system to be robust in as many scenarios as we can.  We should recognise that there may be circumstances in the future where a significant proportion of the mining industry switch to RBF as its in their own self interest.  We should plan for this now and adopt it now, so its not a shock to the system if it does occur in the future.
**2 - Issues with FSS-RBF**
The problem is a lack of inputs, what if the user simply does not have input 2 in their wallet?
Let me provide two examples:
Example 1
* New wallet set up with 1 BTC and one input
* User unable to use FSS-RBF
Example 2
* Wallet has two inputs, 0.5BTC and 0.4BTC
* User buys a coffee for 0.6BTC
* User unable to use FSS-RBF
One suggested idea is that when a wallet is installed, it immediately creates many transactions with many outputs waiting for use in FSS-RBF.  However its unclear how many to make or what size the output should be.  This will create many more transactions and damage scalability.  Also the outputs will then be merged later on into transactions damaging privacy, as everything is traced back to the initial wallet set up.
As you can see how to manage wallets then becomes very difficult and is a trade off between between three factors:
* Ability to use FSS-RBF
* Privacy
* Resources/scalability (e.g. UTXO bloat)
This makes creating and using a wallet very complicated and impractical.  On balance I think this makes it clear that FSS-RBF is not the way to go.
**3 - Future breakdown of fees and volume**
In general I agree with you it would be good if volume grows rather than average fees.  However, we should still try to ensure the fee market is as efficient and as functional as possible.  A more efficient market is likely to mean lower fees.
**4 - 0 Conf concerns**


I agree with you here.  The point about the flight or hotel is that I have booked these services with 0 conf and they are still available.  Merchants and payment processors need to improve their processes, and stop accepting 0 conf when it is not relevant and hopefully RBF can encourage this.
As for your point about bars and restaurants, I think you make a good point.  However, we are in the very early stages of Bitcoin, very few people use Bitcoin in bars and those that do are early pioneers experimenting.  We need to be willing to face difficulties and challenges when using Bitcoin early, in order to help build a robust seamless system for the future.

I agree. If BU gets over 51% of the hashrate and launch their coin, in my view exchanges should insists on an upgrade (softfork) to BU that adds “wipe-out protection” before listing BU Coin on their exchange.  
I have been constantly asking and advising the BU people to add this protection for over a year now.  The trouble is that “wipe-out protection” seems to go against many aspects of the inherently incoherent BU philosophy.  Many BU proponents say they will (or want to) follow the most work chain no matter what, as that was the way Satoshi wanted it and it is what “Nakamoto consensus” means.
Adding  “wipe-out protection" also shines more light on the BU flaw that even with everyone running BU, total wipe-outs are still a problem, due to the AD mechanism.
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:56:46
I think the BU people are angry, vindictive and irrational.  I think they could force a chainsplit
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:10:04


No.  If AD=12, the EB=1MB nodes can have 11 confirmations.  Then the EB=1.1MB miners find the 12th block and orphan 11 blocks at once.  No idea where 6 comes from here 


No. This does not rely on a majority of miners being malicious.  A transaction could be double spent once in the 1MB chain and a conflicting transaction could be included in the 1.1MB chain.  The transaction then cannot confirm again.
Attackers will be able to spot this situation and exploit it by doing double spend attacks.


No it is not, destroying multi conf due to frustration at 0-conf is a very bad move, in my view.
And you are looking at the wrong alternative.  We have many choices:
1. Dangerous hardfork (BU)
2. Safer hardfork (e.g. like the 10 month grace period Saoshi suggested)
3. Stick with 1MB
4. Safe softfork to 2MB with Segwit
Why are you comparing 1 with 3?  Instead why don't we just do a safe hardfork where this median EB problem doesn't exists?


With BU, if a node's AD is triggered, that node increases the blocksize limit to 16x EB for 24 hours.  (This used to be infinity, but was reduced to 16x in the latest update of BU)
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:03:47
There are all kinds of possible reasons.  I think it's because Core has strong majority support.  Either was 28 days was proven to be too short.

You are considering the spam attack from one very narrow angle, of filling a block.  And besides filling up a block is not really an attack anyway, as Satoshi said:


Source: 
Please note Satoshi used the word customers, not even spammers
What about another more realistic spammer aim of "blocking" some absolute number or certain percentage of transactions? Or the more serious aim of spamming the blockchain or UTXO, which is a permanent issue? What about an attack transaction with too many spam signatures to verify? **These more realistic and serious attacks become much cheaper and more damaging as the blocksize limit increases.**

I disagree and think it's good to have a variety of clients and implementations, for code that would not result in a chain split. You may think we need consensus, but failure to achieve consensus on these issues does not split the chain, that is my point.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:46:42
if there is no distribution in values, then BU's mechanism does not function and we have the current model of strong consensus being required to change a rule.

Well I certainly understood it....  To me that is a vital and core property in the system and why I am so interested in it.


Once again, demand is a function of price.


Yes I can see that.  That is why I keep trying really hard to explain to you how its not a problem.


Yes I do, yes.  Also once 90% is reached the pressure on that miners will be absolutely tremendous and they will cave.  You mentioned earlier "it wasn't understood how change-resistant miners were. "  I think you are kind of right but maybe you miss the key point.  What is important is that the miners want to stick together.  I think that is the thing you didnt understand.  Miners wanting to stick together is what makes Bitcoin work and to me is a Core property of the system.  Once you learn this you will appreciate that getting 95% is very easy.  It has happened twice before.


I agree that we won't have 100% agreement, but that is not what consensus means.


Yes.  With a 95% activation threshold and reasonable grace period.


Here you go with the backlog issue again.  I will stay on the Core chain and I want a permanent backlog.


It doesnt hurt to try..
@_date: 2016-03-21 08:16:26


Why not have the change go to a new address?  I do not see how having the change  coins go back to the old address reduces the number of inputs in future transactions.

Yes they were and they still are


Why did Gavin add this to Classic then?


They were all over @_date: 2016-03-16 01:47:27


Yes you raise a problem, it is an issue that mining centralization is high and the potential of blackmail is another associated problem.  These issues are not a unique problem to activating hardforks with a 95% threshold, they apply in a variety of scenarios such as a double spend attack.  The idea is that incentives are structured in such a way to mitigate this problem as large miners want to protect the integrity of the system which generates their income.  Classic has an almost 24 month activation window and 75% is required to be achieved for any 1,000 blocks in that period.  It is not feasible for one pool to stand up to the entire pressure of the system for that length of time.  Anyway where is the evidence that this is even remotely likely?  Remember right now the community is split right down the middle on Classic, so why even mention it anyway, as there is not strong consensus so it should not happen?


I think you misread the community.  As soon as the 75% threshold sunk in, a large section of the community regarded XT as an attack.  Then Nick Szabo, a highly respected member of the community, came out and called it an attack and that effectively killed it.




Ok, lets assume I agree with you that 1MB and full blocks are a much larger change to the behavior of the network and user experience than an increase to 2MB.  That is a reasonable point.  However that is not the point that is important to me.  The point that is far more important is that Classic is a hardfork and change to the consensus rules.  1MB may be a change in user experience, but its not a change in the rules.  A change in the rules is a far more important issue to me.  That is why my language/argument does not apply in reverse.


I mean that in a pragmatic way.  If you continue down the path for Classic, you will lose. I mean what is the point of driving the community apart AND losing.  If smaller blockers keep protecting the existing rules before strong consensus, we protect the integrity of the system AND win.   Instead you can get 2MB in a consensual way (avoid the cliff) AND win, its a no brainier and win win situation.  Just change the 75% to 95% (+ grace period increase) and you get everything you want.  That is what I mean no what is the point.


Gavin could have got a shift to 2MB in Core earlier than that if he compromised earlier.  Instead he never even asked and  went down a more aggressive route.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:00:50
What is a formal plan?
Is this a formal plan:
Why don't the community get together and show support for a safe and patient hardfork and opposition to a dangerous confrontational hardfork?  This will make it much easier on the developers.
For example if 95% of miners had a "safe hardfork" flag on their blocks
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:30:39


But say the BU miners were 75%. Then the split is:
* 55% - Mining BU coin
* 20% - Mining a 1MB coin
* 25% - honest miners
The honest miners would then mine a longer chain than the 20%
@_date: 2016-03-18 06:24:49


Why?  A Bitcoin owner may want to claim Bitcoin’s blockchain is useful.  Claiming private blockchains are useless does **not** imply Bitcoin's blockchain is any more useful.  The conflict of interest claim is based on false logic.
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:53:04


Thank you.  I have spent a lot of time and effort commenting here.  I am driving myself mad.  It is good to know I am having some impact, even a very limited one.


Sure, if miners do that then that is the current system.  The current system is miners to have strong consensus over EB.  If BU is used, then EB is used as a signalling mechanism and there is a distribution of values, this is the part of BU that is flawed.  Of course, if miners all have the same EB anyway (and high AD), there there is no problem, but **then BU is pointless anyway.**


No it is not the same at all.  You do not need 51% for these attacks if there is a reasonable distribution of EB values or low AD values.


Miners having control of the blocksize is one thing, but doing it in a way such that nodes do not have consensus on the blocksize is a flawed idea and different thing.  I know it sounds rude and "condescending", and I am sorry about this, but it is just a very stupid idea.  It means the network does not effectively or quickly converge on one chain, in which case the system is useless and does not function effectively. 
If you want a dynamic market driven blocksize limit totally decided by miners, you can have miners vote on the blocksize in their header and then take the median value over say 50,000 blocks as the limit.  I know this is not perfect, but if nodes adopt this at least means nodes have **consensus on the limit**.  BU's idea of everyone setting their own rules, and hoping the network somehow converges is not robust.  Of course BU's idea will work more than 99.9% of the time, this is where they are confused and thinking inappropriately.  So what it it works 99.9% of the time?  In adversarial conditions BU's system will sometimes breakdown and users will lose funds, then the money will have no integrity.  99.9% is wholly inadequate.
* Miners controlling the blocksize is not the same as not having strong consensus on the blocksize
Now, you probably think this is "condescending" and you do not like the Core people.  This is a complex network and we need to make decisions purely on technical merit.  It doesn't matter if someone producing an alternative idea is a "nice guy" and someone else is a "rude lying bastard".  If we do not choose on technical merit, we fail.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:12:48
 &gt; First of all, users will only know if the fee was too low after the fact, once their transaction didn't get included. That's when they raise their fee to get a better chance for the next block, again guessing a higher fee upfront, and at the same time forcing others to also make higher guesses upfront.
The wallet could continously keep constructing blocks and making assumptions about the blocks miners will construct.  Then as more transactions arrive into the mempool, the wallet can keep automatically increasing the fee to get into the next block, or whatever the user instructions are.  This could result in a lower fee.  This is what a market is all about.
 &gt; I explained the FSS issue, the FSS system cannot be implemented due to this issus   ??
The lack of a continuous supply of small inputs...


Lets be proactive and build a robust network for the future, rather than letting problems build up.


I am being honest.  My point is, wouldnt it be good if payment processors stoped using 0 conf for these kinds of purchases?  I once booked a hotel one month into the future on 0 conf.


As I explained.  FSS-RBF needs a new input each time the fees are increased.   Most HD wallets **do** have less spare inputs, as typically whenever you spend money you spend all of the money and some is returned back as change.  **If you do not think this is a problem, please implement FSS-RBF**, it will be adopted.

You can analyse any competetive market like that.  What about the USD EUR exchnage rate, if you allow Euro holders to keep rasing their bids for USDs then buyers will need to pay even more, as they will need to outbid others also rasing their bids.
When I explain it like that you can see how this is is a logical fallacy, when you consider the actions of everyone.

Well the UASF will need to be enforced by the economic majority anyway.  Currently 0.13.1 to 0.14 seems to have the economic majority and a majority of these nodes would be required to upgrade for a UASF anyway.  Otherwise, if less than 51% of miners upgrade, the 0.13.1 to 0.14 nodes will be on the original non segwit chain

Well, if they all agree to do this with "strong consensus" then sure.  But you need strong consensus, which is what Core have been saying all along.  BU does not do this.  Of course you could do this without code, but that only works if miners are active (non machine consensus and very centralized.  That does not scale and undermines the system.
This is also not how people say BU will work, there is no reason to assume that will happen and its already not happening.
Also, 75% is not an ok number.  75% is very close to the worst case 50:50 probability scenario.  I think 69% is the actual 50:50 number.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:30:27


Please don’t forget that BU also imposes a lot of new technical, operational and legal challenges for exchanges.
In the past, before BU exchanges were only required to run a compatible client (and maybe, in the event of an unlikely catastrophic technical failure, human intervention by exchange employees may be required).  In contrast to this BU requires active human participation which is is a fundamentally different model for exchanges.
Exchanges may need to consider:
* Which AD &amp; EB value to set?
* How often to review the AD &amp; EB values?
* Who within the exchange as the authority to change the AD &amp; EB values?
* How the AD &amp; EB values compares to the values the miners have chosen?
* Whether to make the AD &amp; EB values public, and what are the implications of publishing these numbers, for example if this could assist attackers?
* Whether the AD &amp; EB value policy needs to be reviewed by lawyers for the legal implications?
* What to do in the event that the exchange’s sticky gate is triggered?
* What to do in the event that the miner’s sticky gates are triggered and how to monitor for the triggering of the miners sticky gate?
* How many confirmations to wait for deposits and how this number compares to the local AD value?
* The risks of setting AD &amp; EB values too high or too low?

SegWit is a blocksize limit increase.  Segwit increases onchain capacity and the methodology used to achieve this is literally more data per block.  With SegWit there will be a 110% blocksize limit increase, larger than people supposedly wanted with Bitcoin Classic. 
Increasing the blocksize limit via SegWit is **faster than a hardfork,** since with a hardfork all nodes need to upgrade before the blocksize limit increase, however with SegWit the increase begins as soon as people start to upgrade.
SegWit is a win win situation, as it includes and blocksize limit increase but does not risk creating an altcoin.  It's a no brainer... Please stop, perhaps inadvertently, contributing to the misinformation campaign, by indirectly  implying SegWit is not a blocksize limit increase            
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:50:23
I am sorry, but I very strongly disagree with your approach.  If a service is under attack by spammers which prevents ordinary users from using the system, the last thing you should do is increase capacity and provide the spammers a full service.  This action just encourages more spam.
If a restaurant is full of homeless people/teenagers  who do not want to eat and are just occupying the tables, the restaurant needs to kick them off.  Increasing capacity would clearly be a stupid response to spam.

I agree, I support the Core roadmap which has a main feature of an effective increase in the cap to around 2MB in a few months time.
In the long term I support BIP100 as a dynamic market based solution.  However, I want to patiently try to persuade others of the merits of BIP100,  rather than trying to impose it on others against their will.  Which amoung other things, would be counterproductive.

This makes RBF-FSS unfeasible and it causes UTXO bloat.  I think in the future almost all payments will be RBF, I don't think it will be a niche case.  RBF allows users to get cheaper transactions and save fees.

It is classified as an attack for a number of reasons:
* It felt like XT proponents wanted it to activate even if there was not strong consensus
* XT had a 75% activation threshold, despite 95% being used in the past for soft forks
* There was no expiration for the activation window
* The grace period was too short
* There were schemes when miners were offered bounties to mine XT blocks
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:15:04


Nobody guarantees this, actually it probably will cause fees to fall in the future.  But the point is some miners may focus on next block profit maxization, in some periods, so they wont care about the future and will adopt RBF.
This will happen if mining is highly competitive 
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:47:02


Nothing to do with colluding on mass.  Waht if I am a hope miner with 0.1% of the global hashrate.  If I run RBF I make more money.  Right?  The impact my 0.1% has on the valuable use case is insignificant.  What about the other 99.9%?


Sure, and it will still work going forward.  Opt in RBF actually makes 0-conf safer, as now the receiver knows if there is an rbf flag or not.


Me.  I bought ETC on day one


The maths is complex combinatorics.  I have written about this in the past.  I will not explain it now.  Basically your 1/81 is just one way the 33% can win, by finding 3 blocks in a row right away.  There are other ways it can win, like the 66% finding a block first and then the 33% finding 5 blocks in a row.  Get it?


I agree that is the most likely outcome (assuming the 75% remains flat).  However, for 66% vs 34%, the probability of the 30% wiping the 66% out in the first few hours is almost 50%.


Nope.  It does not assume that no


Well we disagree here.  But if you were rational and made the hardfrok safer just to appease me, we wouldnt have a problem

Why have we just done two forks with a 95% threshold then?  Why don't we shift to 2MB now, using 95%, but if it doesn't work lets discuss the threshold then.  What would you rather do, lose at 75% or win at 95%, please let me know?


I agree there is strong support for 2MB.  I support 2MB.  But again, you are missing the point.  The community is split right down the middle on the 75% issue, not the 2MB issue. 


What has some transaction relaying policy got to do with anything.  If you don't like it create a version without opt in RBF.  When large blockers compare this issue to a change in the consensus rules it makes small blockers think they are clueless on technical matters.  This drives a wedge in the community.  Why mention this?


I thought there is one person running 800 Classic nodes.  Also have you seen data on the proportion of Core and Classic nodes that store the full blockchain.  I think Core is over 60% and Classic is below 20%.


That is expressing a wish financially, but not by running a node.  If someone runs 800 nodes then these are non economic nodes as they are not connected to a wallet.


Just shift to 95% and increase the grace period and you would get me and many others on your side.  We would then form a strong majority.


Yes we each have a different focus.   I want a high capacity cheap network with a lot of users and growth, but this is secondary to ensuring the consensus rules cannot change without consensus.  Ensuring this characteristic is my primary objective.  We already have high capacity easy to use financial systems, making a system where the rules can't change without strong consensus is unique and therefore must be the priority.  The competitive advantage must take priority because that is the best and smartest strategy.  Prioritizing capacity may be the most obvious way forward, but when you think about it preserving the competitive advantage is smarter.


Yes, momentum for Classic is building, and Classic may score a narrow victory.  But a narrow victory is not sufficient, it needs an easy victory that completely destroys the existing rules.  If not we have system failure.  I think we are approaching system failure.


I am not responsible for  moderation policy nor do I advocate it.  Therefore why mention this.  You do advocate Classic.


Why not do it unilaterally?  In my view 95% is a victory maximizing number.  Why not target victory maximization?


**A a one month grace period is too short and an absolute non starter.**  I will not accept such a low grace period with any activation threshold, even 100%.  We must give node operators time to upgrade.  In 2013 Gavin said this period should be at least 6 months.


Nobody wants to make 0-confs worse than they already are.
What if SegWit gives us a capacity increase anyway?  Do you still require a HF then.


Most Core devs keep putting forward proposals but keep being ignored by your side:
* Matt's 1.5MB HF proposal
* BIP103
* The recent agreement and idea of around 2MB implemented in July 2016
* Wlad being "weakly against" 20MB and asking for a moderate proposal

Adding a limit is not a hard fork.  Removing an existing rule makes it a backward incompatible hard fork which splits the network.
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:42:45


Recently, the Core team has made significant actual  progress in the  area of scalability.  For example:
* Segwit, which includes linear scaling of sighash operations, malleability fixes, reducing the amount of data required by the signature generator and a large c110% **onchain** capacity increase
* Libsecp256k1, which improved signature validation speeds by c7x
* A mempool limiting option mode for nodes
* Pruned mode
* Blocks only mode for nodes
* Reducing upload traffic
* Compact blocks
* Opt in RBF - helping the sender increase the priority of transactions 
* CPFP - helping the receiver increase the priority of transactions 
* Headers first
* Script signature cache has been re-implemented
* Assumed-valid blocks
* P2P network refactoring
* Fee estimation  technology that is harder to game
* Continued work on the development of LN and payment channel technology
* Plus much much more
It is great that after all the throughput increases and growth Bitcoin has seen, the Bitcoin Core software manages fine, isn't bloated and doesn't crash, like so much other software seems to do when usage increases.

The reciever could just send the Bitcoin back.  This could be sent instantly before the input transaction confirms and with a zero fee.  Child pays for parent should be working by then.
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:04:42


Sorry, I do not understand.  Segwit is already 2MB, but a SF.  You are saying move the commitment to the header, making it a HF.  I am saying that is both pointless and dangerous.


So now there is one pointless bit added to make it a hardfork and then also moving the commitment to the header?


No.  I think the hardfork should do needed stuff like increase transaction capacity, not just be done for the sake of it.

Well it is not clear how BIP100 is being implemented into BU 
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:18:17


That is false.  Alternative clients can be discussed here.  The controversial moderation policy is about encouraging the adoption of deliberately incompatible clients which would cause a chain split and create a new coin.  Please do not confuse these two different things, the sometimes delibrate confusion can create unnecessary tension.  For example it leads to accusations of a monopoly development team.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:45:35


Does Roger realize that if BU occurs with 60% of the hashrate, assuming the split stays 60% vs 40%, the old chain has a c55% to c60% chance of retaking the lead and wiping out BU coin's UTXO set from existence
Activating at 60%, without wipe-out protection, is ridiculously stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:41:01
Oh is 16MB the default now?  I see most miners have EB as 1MB and many nodes have 16MB.
In my comment above I meant AD of 12 was reccomended, rather than the EB. (However most miners seem to have AD=6 and EB=1MB) 
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:03:23


The problem is there may not be any more spare inputs.  Every time you increase the fee you would need a spare input lying around.  


Please put your proposal forward.  The Core team cannot think of such a way.  One idea is to mark the change address, but this reduces privacy and the merchant will need to reject transactions marked as change, which is the same as rejecting transactions marked as RBF anyway.


Instead of guessing a high fee upfront.  Users can set a low fee and then only increase it in certain conditions, like there are a lot of other transactions coming through or miners have been unlucky, therefore the bid will need to go up to get into the next block.  This allows for a more efficient market and the users should therefore pay lower fees overall.


I explained why FSS does not work.  I agree it would be great if FSS could work.  Maybe you have some ideas?


Firstly miners are currently fighting for the block reward, so this discussion is not that relevant.  However, we are 70% of the way through the block reward, so its important to plan for the future when miners are motivated by fees.  Lets be proactive now and address these issues upfront, rather than be reactive later on.  Historically mining was done out of passion or for a hobby.  These miners cared about the interests of the system and not short term profit.  If Bitcoin is successful, then we are likely to have a highly distributed competitive mining industry.  These miners may only have a 0.1% market share and will want to maximise there next block cashflow, rather than benefit the system.  This is because they never even know when they will find another block.  Miners may eventually look after themselves, in part due to the tragedy of the commons type problem.  "If that other miner cares only about themselves why shouldn't I, I am only 0.1% of the system", they could reason.  The industry may not always look like this, but it might some of the time.  The rational behaviour of these short term miners, will be to maximise fees in the next block and therefore adopt RBF, whether we like it or not. 


That is why RBF is opt in.  Please explain to be why you should be able to order a book or airline tickets from an e-commerce website using 0 conf?  **You can currently do this now.**  It would make these systems, better and more robust for the future if they no longer allowed this.  There is no downside I can think of, other than the time spent improving the systems.


That is why RBF is opt in.  Anyway, I think real store tiny purchases is a very small use case, where Bitcoin lacks some of its competitive advantages.  In addition to this there are a lot of solutions to this problem, for example:
* The coffee shop owner knows the customers personally or makes a human to human judgement as to whether to trust you
* The coffee shop owner installs a security camera
* The coffee shop owner refuses to accept RBF transactions and returns these immediately
* The coffee shop owner uses payment channels, third party escrow or custody accounts

As a Core supporter I have been asking BU to activate and get the split done for a long time now.  I know many Core supporters have been saying the same

@_date: 2016-01-27 03:57:52
Why do you need to use the term "denouncing the censorship"?  Why can't a more moderate and constructive statement be used, for example:
"Deciding on the moderation policy on is an extremely difficult task, and finding the right balance can be challenging, however it can improve.  Whilst the moderation policy of a web forum is independent of Bitcoin core, most members of the core team do not agree with some aspects of the moderation policy.
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:50:08


No, but the utility of the transactions will increase.  The more important the transaction to the user the higher the fee, therefore more of the important transactions to the user gets in the chain.  This is an incredibly effective method of allocating scare resources and this method has been hugely beneficial to society, and is responsible for bringing billions of people out of poverty.  It's called capitalism.

We need to make the system incentive compatible.  It is naive and irresponsible to think that miners will care about what is best for bitcoin, rather than their own self interest.
But RBF is up to the miners, they can do FSS or RBF, its up to them.  They have had their own policies since as far back as 2011 as far as I know.


No I am not. One could even pump it without a chain if an exchange opens a trading pair for coins already in the exchange


Lol, dont be silly now.  I said that is just one way of retaking the lead.


That is another thing I meant, but your basic maths is also wrong.  the 33% could find three blocks in a row, 1/81 or two in a row, then the 66% finds one and then two in a row again.
When yoy run the numbers, (assuming no lead) a 66% BU chain has a c46% chance of winning.  A 71% BU chain has a c50% chance of winning.  That is why 75% is such a bad idea, it is very close to the worst case 50:50 scenario.


Well, the bigger the price differential the greater the upside returns.  For example if BU coin had a value of $500 and Core coin had a value of $1.  I would only need to spend 1 BU coin to get 500 Core coins.
Therefore to get  the rally started, not much at all.
But why leave BU open to this risk?  What is the point of giving Core the asymmetric advantage?
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:07:11


Some of the differences include:
1. With BU the length of each of these forks is likely to be longer, since the other way when miners happen find a different block at the same time is likely to be resolved faster, as it only lasts by repeated coincidence 
2. With BU, an attacker can deliberately instigate the split with less hashrate than would be required by a comparible selfish mining attack 
3. The split and the outcome  is more predictable and observable  for attackers
4. The dynamics of this split in BU are fundemtally different since it is not just about which chain is longer but also about the size of blocks.  For example the smaller block chain has an advantage over the larger block chain 
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:11:57


No I am thinking of a transaction being confirmed and then blackmailing a miner to orphan it.


Remember you can try this all day everyday until the miner you blackmail gets lucky.  5% is sufficient.


But you want to fork away from Core anyway.  So why not get me on your side?


Many have already.  Including the most prominent ones 


Did you think XT would win?  Trust me, to the miners it is the issue.


No it does not.  The Core devs cannot change the consensus rules and they have never done a HF.  You continue to misunderstand the situation.  Developers can only prevent a HF, strong support across all parts of the community are required to do a HF.


With XT, yes I would be angry and would have left Bitcoin.  XT would have been catastrophic for the network.  The Core team probably does have enough weight in the community to tip support for Classic into the strong support category.  Therefore 75% could be ok, a 28 day grace period would still be far too short and I would still probably leave based on that.


No they wouldn't.  As many core devs, including me messaged Gavin before the Classic activation methodology was released informing him he would have are full support if 95% was chosen (and a reasonable grace period).  Gavin decided he did not want my support.


This is not true, Opt in RBF only improves the reliability of zero conf by giving greater clarity.  Secondly, as you said technically it's not a consensus rule.  Decisions need to made on technical merit only.


There is no need for consensus, I think the less consensus on this issue the better.  Core devs are technical engineers not PR people.  Don't blame Core for having bad PR, they are volunteers and don't have to do anything.  They should focus on technical things and technical merit.


"Acting on the desires of hundreds of others", I simply cannot reply to this, if you think this is a reasonable argument then maybe we are too far apart.


Almost everyone on the smaller block side is extremely critical of the 75% idea.


Reality is 75% of miners CAN do a hard fork just fine.
Except they won't. 
 &gt; So if you want a coin that physically cannot be changed by 75% majority
No, I want a coin where 75% of the miners  will refuse to do a hardfork because they think 75% is too low and they want to make sure they stick together, above all else.  Remember Classic cannot activate at 95% but only  at 75%.  It's not a maximum of 25% of miners opposed to Classic, but Classic almost guarantees there is exactly  25% opposition.  This stupidity must prevent miners from supporting Classic.  This is why I oppose 75% so much, because it guarantees opposition.  **If it was 75% or more I could support it** Do you understand this point?


Yes! Exactly! You are starting to understand how stupid the activation methodology is.
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:29:35
It will be a competitive market. 
When you think of game theory like that, you are thinking of it in one particular way, please think of the game from multiple angles.  Remember miners are also optimizing their fee strategies at the same time.  Miners want to include as many transactions as possible in their candidate block, to get as much fees ad they can because they don't know when or even if they will get to find a valid block.
Yes there is a bidding war, but at the same time there is a selling war.  This is a healthy competitive market

A hardfork unfortuntely has a bunch of problems and risks.  Many of these problems have already been solved, but BU ignores all these solutions and just goes ahead with the hardfork in the most danageous way possible, ignoring all the risk mitigation strategies, even the ones that have successfully worked in the past
* XT/Classic mitigated risk by having a miner threshold, BU ignores this idea
* ETH/ETC mitigated risk by having a clean hardfork, such that both chains can survive, BU ignores this idea
* Satoshi/Etheruem and even XT/Classic had the idea of a flag day to allow people time to upgrade and prevent a malicious miner from starting the harfork early and trigger a split, BU ignores this idea
* Core is researching ideas to make the hardfork even safer such a soft-hardfork with header format change or merge mining hardfork idea, BU ignores these
BU is clearly the most irresponsible hardfork attempt by a massive margin
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:35:20
I am sure if you met the Core developers you would think they are very nice.  Unfortunately they have been subject to a well resourced negative propaganda campaign attacking their characters.
However, this is science.  The level of apparent douchebagery of developers  should mean nothing and the software should be selected purely on technical merit.  If not Bitcoin is probably stupid anyway, such that it's not worth worrying about the character of individuals.
A charismatic leader type person with a huge marketing budget  could always emerge and ask people to run crappy code, to screw up the systen. We need to be resilient against this and assess code on merit

No.  That is not how AD works.  AD = 12, does not mean 12 blocks on all competing chains.  It means 12 additional confirmations in a chain with larger blocks, in order to trigger the sticky gate.


Users could send hundreds of deposits to an exchange on the 1.1MB chain, then once confirmed, they send hundreds conflicting transactions on the 1MB chain, in the hope just one of the hundreds of potential conflicting transactions gets through.
The trouble BU people is they don't seem to think in these adversarial ways and just assume everyone is nice.  Sure if everyone is nice, maybe we can have BU, infact we do not even need money at all.


Lets say you increase the limit as follows:
* Step 1 - achieve strong consensus across the community
* Step 2 - release client that still enforces the 1MB limit for 10 months, then at a pre determined block number, increases the limit to 2MB
* Step 3 - Everyone runs this new client
For an example of this see Satoshi's quote, which explained exactly this...


     if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
     maxblocksize = largerlimit
Source: 
If this method is used, then miners are either all enforcing a 1MB limit or they are all enforcing a 2MB limit.  There is no window of opportunity for an attacker.
However, we are now a $20bn economy.  Core is researching all kinds of additional safety mechanisms:
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:53:23


Erik that is not a practical position to take.  Putting the network through this unpredictable period is not acceptable to many people and highly disruptive to businesses.  Exchanges mentioned they want 24 x 7 x 365 uptime, not a protracted and volatile  battle with no clear end date, that could cause loss of funds and damage the reputation of the system.
But above all, the above is simply not necessary.  Instead of that we can get strong consensus BEFORE the hardfork occurs, to avoid all the uncertainty and problems.
Since deciding on which chain is Bitcoin after a hardfork is not necessary for a hardfork, the prudent and sensible thing to do is to always rally behind the existing rules when a contentious hardfork occurs, to avoid the uncertainty.  This ensures the system is always up and reliable, which is absolutely necessary for many businesses, investors and users. **Perhaps this is not necessary for you, but please respect those who consider this a vital property of the system.  I never want a new investor to buy Bitcoin, only to discover later that they bought coins on the wrong chain.**  Therefore please, for pragmatic ressons, only support hardforks that have consensus across the community BEFOREHAND.

I appreciate your comment, and I agree  with you.  The word terrorist is bad.  Emotions are clearly high.
However, this issue has gone on for a long time and we are getting nowhere.  BU is fundemtally flawed at protocol level, full of destructive bugs and contains no safety mechanisms for the hardfork whatsoever (even replay attack mitigation, wipeout protection or a flag day).  This has been explained to BU supporters many times and yet they still push people to run BU.  The exchanges said they would not list BU coin unless they at least fix replay attacks and they refused, some even claimed replay attacks are good.  A bug in BU allowed anyone to remotely shut down all the nodes, yet after that  they still campaigned for people to run BU and the BU hashrate still climbs.
The above should make it clear that the BU people are hostile to Bitcoin.  We cannot let this hostile threat continue to keep lingering over the community.  Negotiation or compromise now looks impossible, with so much of the hashrate running a hostile client.
We need to be realistic here.  It looks like there will be a destructive chainsplit, unfortunately compromise  does not look possible.
Maybe the best thing we can do is get the chainsplit done and then we can all move forward

BU is fundamentally flawed:
1. It removes the core "longest chain" principal in Bitcoin.  With BU, your node can regard a shorter chain as the true if a longer chain has not reached the AD threshold
2. The system is fundamentally divergent, resulting in multiple chains
3. Confirmations are undermined
4. Loads of new devastating attack vectors are opened up, like the sticky gate triggering or the median EB attack.  The median EB attack allows a miner to trigger an arbitrary 50/50 split in the network at will, by only finding one block, simply by choosing the median of the EB values miners flag

@_date: 2017-03-07 04:02:02


Yes, we need everyone to agree on EB beforehand and then set a grace period and then activate the rule.  This is excactly what BU does NOT do.


If 51% can hardfork, then I will stick to USD coin, which is also ruled by 51% in a general election.  Teh whol point of Bitcoin is 51% cannot eliminate existing rules
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:23:11
Sorry not now.  I have written enough on this subject.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:49:34
Exactlty.  And if we stopped being so arrogant and deluded we would realize  how brilliant the USD is in so many areas, and that by "compromising" with BU  we lose ALL Bitcoin has over the USD.
 
@_date: 2017-03-30 00:17:21


That was not me


1. The most important thing to do, is make sure you run a fully validating node for your own incoming transactions.
2. Make your opposition to BU clear in public forums, mentioning that BU is flawed, dangerous and poorly implemented.  Politely explain the issues with BU, such as the poor implementation, the "median EB attack" and broken protocol, the negligence of the developers and the lack of any basic safety measures for the hardfork
3. Write in to Coinbase &amp; Breadwallet, who have said they may follow the longest chain even if invalid, when the validity rules had changed without consensus across the community. ( Make it clear to them that this is not how Bitcoin does or can work, and that they have a duty to protect client funds.  Coinbase said that "Customers should take note that they will not be able to withdraw bitcoin from or deposit bitcoin to Coinbase for a period of up to 24 hours or more following the fork" the community needs to make it clear to them that this is not acceptable and that up-time and reliability are crucial in Bitcoin.  I would recommend withdrawing your funds from Coinbase ASAP.
4. If you are located near Coinbase/Breadwallet or other such organisation, go to visit their offices and speak to junior staff, making your position clear.  In person, face to face lobbying is vital in my view.  BU supporters are doing extensive meetings globally.  We need to leverage the widespread global opposition to BU across the community to conduct these face to face meetings in local areas.  Lets start from the bottom of these organisations and build grass roots opposition to BU.
5. Support a SegWit UASF in principal, if their is strong support across the community. Lobby businesses to get their support for a UASF
6. Lobby light client developers to implement fraud proofs, with respect to the 1MB limit.
I would not recommend mining at a loss.  This battle could go on a while and we do not want to burn our funds.  Lets be prudent and conservative in our expenditure.

Ok.  So what?

CPFP and opt in RBF can work together.
What mess?  Why would anyone use an RBF payment if the terminal says not to do this?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:30:17


Ok.  Well this obviously needs to be properly worked out.  Otherwise the system is just a nonsense.
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:07:56


1. How did they get to 80% without first crossing 50%?
2. Actually a 50/50 split is only a simplification.  80% is actually pretty close to the c70% vs c30% worst case scenario, where each side has a 50:50 chance of winning  (remember the smaller block side has the asymmetric advantage)
3. Even with the 80%/20% split.  You still have 20% of nodes on the wrong chain for 12 blocks (if they set AD = 12).  These 20% of nodes then can have incoming transactions with 11 confirmations wiped from their wallets.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:43:20
How does that make sense?  Leading zeros at the front of the number have the same interpretation whatever the base of the number system....
Right? 
The 256 bit output of bitcoin sha256 hash in binary, will also have leading zeros (around 4x as many), just like the hex output does  
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:29:07


Ok, please write a wallet implementation and I will support it.  I do not know how this is possible, if you do write it.


This can improve privacy and reduce the UTXO set.  Either way, no modern wallet leaves loads of small inputs lying around.
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:49:12
If we are going to play this high stakes game of chicken, why not give everyone at least 12 months to upgrade?
By the way, I do think we can win the game of chicken, but that is not sufficient grounds to support playing.
What is our objective?  To win a game of chicken or protect Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:37:30
There is still a blocksize limit increase as others segregate their witness.
Their plan is FT, which changes ALL transaction types.  This concern is therefore illogical

But don't you see how that's changing the money for political reasons, resilience to political pressure is what got so many people interested in Bitcoin in the first place 
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:31:37
The scenario I am talking about is the following:
* BU has 80% miner support 
* last week a miner tried to launch BU, this caused a failed 10 block orphaned chain 
* the bitcoin price fell from $150 to $100 and sentiment is low
* BU look like there will be another attempt soon
In this scenario I think the UASF may be neccassary
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:21:14


This is wrong.  BU has no threshold
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:43:08
Well thats BU...
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:25:07
I agree.  It feels like somebody saying:


@_date: 2016-03-17 23:53:43


Well unlike packets on the internet, transactions need to be broadcast to, downloaded on, verified by and stored on every node.  I think that's a little different than internet data packets, where only the receiver needs it.  Maybe this misunderstanding is causing some confusion.
In addition the internet does not have an expensive consensus mechanism that needs to be financed by fees for space in packets.


This is why its important to have fees, therefore everyone is neutral and the highest fee wins.  Rather than choosing transactions in the way you suggest.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:27:58
The Core team have strong technical expertise and credentials.  I am not aware of the Classic sides reputation for economics...
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:34:28


Stop focusing so much on Core or the repository.  If Wlad merged something stupid or did a contentious hardfork, we could just move to a different repository.  There is nothing special or magical about Core that you keep implying


People choose to run Core, if you dont like it, run another compatible client like BCoin/BTCD ect.  Then, once Core is an insignificant development team we can hardfork without worrying about what they say or do


Well that has not happened, nor would it, in my view.


But what are the downsides of putting in basic safety features?  I understand you do  not think they are necessary, but so what?  Other people do think they are necessary, so why not?


In your view.  In my view an economically relevent blocksize limit, that makes transaction volume lower than it would otherwise have been is vital.  Please respect others


Where?  When Satoshi told people not to do the hardfork and suggested a basic safety mechanism of the 10 month grace period?  Instead of misrepresenting Satoshi why don't you at least reject a hardfork without the basic safety mechanism he suggested?
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:38:32


Ok sure.  But the threats cause hostility which make the hardfork unsafe


Erik, this is so frustrating. SegWit IS LITERALLY larger blocks.  Your comment somehow implies this is not the case.  Please tell me you understand this now...
Also, we should not change the Bitcoin rules as a result of quid pro quo negotiations and compromises.  We either think SegWit is a good idea or not, once we start negotiating like this the integrity of the system is damaged
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:05:29
RBF is not an alternative security system to 0 conf.  0 conf is not a security measure either

BU devs were discussing the issue and made no public comment.
A non BU person then reviewed logs of their node, saw the invalid block report and then found the invalid block.  They then published the details
Only after this did BU make a comment. After firstly dismissing the issue, for example Roger Ver said "orphans happen all the time" and that it was not an invalid block as the 1MB limit is illegitimate:


At no point did BU devs advice people not to run BU 1.0.0     
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:17:18


Any significant divergence opens up this attack vector.  It doesn't matter how small the limit increase.  Even an increase from 1MB to 1.1MB opens up this attack vector
The median EB attack is just an example of the most obvious attack that is easiest to explain.  There are all kinds of variants to it, some involving AD.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:16:33
You could be right here (I personally don't have a problem with opt in RBF).  My point is simply this is not a chain fork and it cannot create a new coin.  That's all I am saying. We should not conflate any other issue, however serious, with a chain fork.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:35:37


I do not follow sorry.  What if there are 1,000 miners, all with 0.1%


calculating the exact probability requires combinatorics no matter how unlikely it is
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:29:00


That is not true.  The agreement said only to run Core compatible code, e.g. Bitcoin Core, BTCD, BCoin or any other compatible implementation would be fine.


The agreement also said the hardfork would only occur with "widespread support across the entire community".  Miners then started breaking this agreement by dangerously campaigning for a hardfork without the necessary support across the entire community.  Many people, myself included, will always rally behind the existing rules, at all costs, in the event somebody tries  to hardfork without basic safety mechanism or strong consensus, as this is the only model that keeps the network up and running and robust.  This is the only way the rules will be resilient against attackers.
The agreement only said the developers present would provide code, which they did:
This is all those developers can do
The discussion was at the meeting focused on analyzing the usage of the network after SegWit to see how much extra capacity may be needed in the following hardfork.  This clearly indicates that SegWit was supposed to occur before a hardfork
Once the campaign to do the hardfork in a dangerous way becomes insignificant and SegWit activates.  I will support a safe hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:38:30


So now miners change two blocksize variables:
* EB
* The BIP100 blocksize number
Why not just get rid of the EB one?  Also what do nodes do?  What happens when the BIP100 blocksize is different to EB?
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:10:35


So you don't think any broken protocol is possible?  You think **all** protocols must work and be fault tolerant?  Despite the many failed attempts at Bitcoin beforehand?


No BU does not work, nor is there any evidence for that claim.  The "median EB attack", clearly and concisely demonstrates that the BU protocol is fundamentally broken
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:22:04


Maybe wallets can update this every second.  Always trying to keep the lowest possible fee to get into the next block.  You can have sone headroom, but this headroom will be smaller than without RBF.


The memepool is just as transparent as the USD EUR order book.  Also there is guessing and anticipation on the USD EUR market.  You don't know if your order gets filled or what happens to the other bids and offers when you make an order

Illustrative numbers 
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:44:59


Another example:
 * Wallet has 2 inputs, one 0.5BTC and one 0.4BTC
 * Payment amount 0.6BTC
 * Conclusion: **No FSS-RBF possible**
Please work through these scenarios and you will see how difficult FSS-RBF becomes.  This greatly increases the complexity of wallets and introduces a number of difficult trade offs (with respect to privacy and UTXO bloat/scalling).  Opt in RBF is far more simple to implement.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:43:21


Yes, much worse.  Its basically the worst idea I have ever seen.
In contrast Core is researching all kinds of additional safety mechanisms:


I understand you want a blocksize limit increase.  But I do not understand why anyone would support such a vulnerable and dangerous way of doing it, when there are so many better alternatives.  This is why I think BU must be a malicious attack
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:31:19


Ironically that's pretty much how aviation works, but that's not the point.  In aviation the marginal cost of adding an extra passenger on the plane is almost zero, when demand is low the price falls to almost zero, see Ryanair.  That is why the industry needs an equilibrium price, to remain viable.  Large blockists make comments like "capacity needs to be above demand" , don't you see how this doesn't make economic sense?


Antpool currently mines empty blocks when the mempool is non empty.  This is quite strong proof the network is already not coping well with 1MB and that propagation and verification times are too high


Bitcoin is already successful.  However we should aim high and try to build a robust and sustainable core network for the future. 




Sounds pretty good. 
Please compare like with like.  Confirmation is analogous to settlement in the credit card network which can take months.  Propagation in Bitcoin is faster and more reliable than credit cards at the moment.  However ultimately we won't build a sustainable lead against VISA when it comes to speed, cost and capacity.  A centralised system has many advantages.  At the moment VISA is complacent, but the company will react to Bitcoin. Let's be smart and focus on Bitcoin’s unique properties and strengths, which is permissionless payments and permissionless innovation.  Let's not compromise the core strengths for a temporary advantage in an area we will eventually lose in.


RBF was Satoshi's idea and was implemented in the first version of Bitcoin.  Opt in RBF is opt in only, it actually makes the 0 conf double spend harder when not opted in as the intentions are clearer to miners.


This is how Bitcoin works.  If you have a better idea please share it.  Before confirmation it's just a signed broadcast, there is nothing special here.  This should be no problem in most circumstances and there are a variety of tools to prevent stealing, some unique to Bitcoin and mostly already adopted by normal businesses, like CCTV, KYC, basic judgement ect ect


The wallet can automatically pay enough to get you confirmed in the next block if you want.  That is a very effective way of allocating resources, by the price.  This is users outbidding each other just like Satoshi said.


Over the long term sudden demand surges are not likely.  However the wallet can always increase the fee if you want.  But in most cases **nobody will care anyway:**
* buying a cheap coffee - nobody cares it's a coffee and the shopkeeper trusts you enough
* buying a house - nobody cares as the contact is void without payment 
* buying a car - you need to give ID anyway and you can pay enough of a fee when buying a car
* ordering a iPhone - the order takes days to deliver anyway and they have your address so why would you steal?
* Airline tickets - the tickets can be cancelled if you double spend


You were saying you don't want to outbid others....


That's not my point
 &gt; A natural fee market was developing without artificial scarcity. 
Like how Satoshi Dice became unviable?  Good let's keep 1 MB for a while then...


BIP103 was a sensible prudent proposal that had increases all the way up to 1GB and was supported by the three main Core Devs, including the project lead.  Gavin decided to reject it.  It could have been implemented by now, but instead Gavin refused to compromise.


Thanks.  I would also support a move to 2MB, along with a strong majority of the community, if it is done in a respectful prudent way, unlike Classic with the short 28 day grace period.  Ironically we could have 2MB now if Classic advocates were more reasonable in their activation methodology. 


I also support a hashpower vote.  I strongly oppose a binding hashpower flag with a trigger mechanism that boots full nodes from the network, especially with a low 75% threshold.  Let's have a non binding hashpower vote like the Core devs suggested then.  I am sure 2MB will have a clear majority rather than 95% opposition, but some people want a contentious fight.  Like Brian Armstrong who wants to get rid of the Core team due to there poor communication skills.  I am not even joking.


Two softforks activated with a 95% threshold and in 2013 Gavin said a hardfork should have at least a 6 month grace period.  These principles have been abandoned because Classic advocates are worried consensus is not strong enough, they even admit this.  That is why Classic is a clear example of an attack.  Just like how Nick Szabo called XT an attack.


Core devs wrote many of them.  See BIP103.
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:13:57


Sure that would be a crisis for Visa.  I do not see what that has to do with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is not about high speed transactions, it can take an hour for a block to be found.  If you want high speed and low fees we need something like LN.  We do not want to screw up the base layer of bitcoin for something it could never do.


Without a checkpoint, the incentive to wipe out the BU chain is just massive for speculators.


Your maths is wrong.  Yes 1/(3^4) = 1/81, but that is just one of the many ways of retaking the lead.  Also there are other financial factors at play, rather than just hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:32:44
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:02:32


Lol.  Well leading zeros have the same "interpretation" in base 2 and base 16. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 11:52:35
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:40:46
SegWit does exactly that.  SegWit also fixes the quadratic scaling of sighash operations problem, which makes it safer to increase the blocksize limit even further later on.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:37:37
Its not a hardfork 
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:21:04


Then lets put it in code then....  Rather than converting the system to a flawed and vulnerable human system that does not scale and relies on miners being centralized to work.  
What if the mining industry was not structured the way it is now, but instead was 10,000 disperate small miners at home, who rarley monitor the system or keep up to date.  Would you say the same thing then?  Please do not lock in mining centralization into the protocol,


Ok sure, clear majority, i agree.  I would say "no significant opposition"
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:00:26


* allowing lower fees and a more efficient fee market 
* removing stuck transactions 
* consistent with the behaviour of profit maximising mininers in a competitive environment.  Therefore preparing for the eventual reality anyway.
* causes wallets and payment processors to improve their systems.  E.g. ecommerce orders should be marked as paid after confirmation.  This makes the system more robust and deals with issues proactivly now rather than in a rushed reactionary way later on.  If you order shoes on an ecommerce website the website should wait for confirmations.


This was called FSS-RBF.  This does not work as HD wallets typically do not have spare inputs lying around.  Wallets spend all the money and return the rest as change.  Having these spare inputs would bloat the UTXO.
@_date: 2016-03-18 15:41:52
Fees could come down for a variety of reasons:
1. Capacity increases increasing supply e.g. SegWit or blocksize limit increases via a HF with strong consensus
2. More efficient dynamic fee systems 
3. Reductions in the USD value of BTC
4. Falling demand for blockspace 
5. Introduction of dynamic systems like BIP100
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:36:34


The main reason is that orphan risks are currently to high with respect to fee revenue.  This is being fixed with new technology.


No it would not.  Miners are competing with each other and want to get as much fees as they can for themselves versus the competition.
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:30:35


If this proposal relies on the economic nodes to upgrade and reject non SegWit supporting blocks anyway, why do we need to activate SegWit for the non upgraded  13.1 to 14.0 nodes?
Also 6 months may be too quick in my view
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:12:07
Scenario 1 did happen 
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:51:52


As far as I know, Adam's hashcash was the first system to combine something with a nonce and then to keep changing the nonce until the hash of the string has a required number of leading zeros.  This is exactly the scheme used in Bitcoin.
It is true that others may have presented the concept earlier on, with schemes that did not necessarily require the output of a hash function to have leading zeros, but used different cost functions to prove the work, such as extracting the square root.
- Please correct me if I am wrong
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:58:21


I think its great that exchanges have agreed to call BTU an altcoin.
I really hope this puts an end to this campaign to do a hardfork without even the most basic and well known safety mechanisms.
Hopefully we can now quickly more than double the blocksize with SegWit, and then quickly move on to increase capacity even further, perhaps with a hardfork, except this time in a safe, patient, collaborative, calm and responsible way and with all kinds of clever safety mechanisms (e.g. checkpoint, flag day, replay attack prevention, high miner activation threshold, long grace period, soft-hardfork, changing block header, ect ect).  Lets make the hardfork super safe.
@_date: 2016-03-12 02:05:40
But RBF has nothing to do with the consensus rules.  Therefore everyone has there own RBF policy.  We don't all need the same policy. It's therefore irrelevant to complain about a lack of consensus with respect to RBF
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:41:43


Sorry I was confused...
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:16:21
Right.  So because the output of the work function can be measured a bit more precisely than literally "number of leading zeros",  it makes a difference to Adam Back's creditbility?
    
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:03:01


Either EB is used to change the blocksize and therefore this attack vector is opened up, or the EB mechanism is not used.

The clown car was always obviously broken, therefore the fact it blew up makes no difference to them.  This war will continue and intensify, in my view.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:40:40


It is vital we do not compromise in the face of threats, otherwise we are not robust.  What kind of money is it if an aggressive party can point a gun at the community and say "change the money or I shoot"?  If that works, I would rather use the USD or GBP, with their instant free online transactions and their 100% anonymous censorship resistant two way pegged side chain called paper money.


This seems inevitable now. I think we should embrace the split and do it ASAP.  We need a clean break with replay attack mitigation, wipeout protection and light client protection.
Let's get this done and move on
   
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:49:30
I am not aware of any BU attack clients for miners, like "Not BitcoinXT".  Most miners performing this "attack" on BU seem to be doing it inadvertently 
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:36:01


No I am not


This only happens in monopoly environment,  not a competitive one.  Please be positive, and assume Bitcoin works and mining is competitive.  Miners are competing with each  other and cannot demand more fees.   In a competitive market price = marginal cost.  As we can explaining the marginal cost is near zero


No I don't, in the long term I support BIP100
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:02:18


I think its not supposed to be option, but enabled by default for each transaction. Each transaction could have multiple fee increases (maybe hundreds one day).  It is just not feasible to have that many inputs.


Don't HD wallets sweep up all the inputs?  My wallet has one input right now
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:13:59


Also, only private members can propose BUIPs
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:47:48
With respect to a hardfork to 2MB of of non-witness data, I do not think its right to do that in the current climate.
I do not think its right to hardfork in response to the threats of BU.  We should compromise, but in a positive way, not by making threats.  If we give into threats and hardfork we damage the integrity of the currency.
In a few years time, if Bitcoin grows, there are likely to be hostile parties much more powerful and sophisticated than BU, also capable of making threats to try and force a hardfork.  Bitcoin must be resilient against these threats or it is not robust and therefore pointless.
Last year there was a big push for Bitcoin Classic with 2MB, then Core finally delivered a proposal for even more than 2MB blocks with SegWit.  Now people are changing the goalposts and saying Core have not done enough.  This changing of the goalposts feels hostile and disruptive to me.
The Hong Kong consensus agreement said  that the hardfork:


Please can we honor this agreement.  Lets stop trying to hardfork with these aggressive tactics and then finally start the process of hardforking with the necessary support across the entire community that was agreed to.
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:09:48


I have never heard that claim, I think you are misrepresenting this concerern.  If there is no blocksize limit then fees may eventually fall to levels which are insignificant, in a sufficiently competitive mining industry.  This view is consistent with economic theory, namely price = marginal cost under perfect competition.  This is different to your  claim that a blocksize increase will make fees disappear. 
It is true that the current mining industry is far from perfectly competitive. However I do not understand why the large blockers crowd are so pessimistic and think competition can't improve.  Let's be  positive and plan for success.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:48:21


This coordination issue is exactly what the Core side wants.
* Step 1 - get the strong consensus across the community (aka coordination)
* Step 2 - release a client for a flag day with a hardfork, occurring in the future
It is the refusal of the "large blocks at any cost" side to do the coordination, which is the problem.


I am unable to even make BUIP proposals.  Only private members can do that
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:33:03

Nobody has described to me how to get all the inputs and I cannot think of a way.  If you think its trivial do a technical (non code writeup) of how it works and how inputs are generated then I will rewiew or code it.  
 **For example when you first start your wallet you have one input.  Would the wallet split this up automatically on receipt of payment?** Once you begin to try to work it out you will appreciate how complex this is.  Eventually you will see that its not worth it.


Yes, I was oversimplifying, however you may need to merge everything later to make a large transaction, so it can be more effective to merge earlier.  This is a difficult topic, and FSS-RBF could make this much harder.


That is not the only reason 


Its not trivial, if it is, please do a writeup.  If you see something here others dont, you could get this into core.

I cant think of any payments that will only work with RBF, but I think most payments will be RBF to save fees.
0 conf is irrelevant in a wide variety of purchases anyway.  For example:
* ecommerce (since order processing is significantly longer than 10 minutes)
* services (e.g. travel, consultancy ect, since delivery is more than 10 minutes into the future 
* large purchases like a car or house, since the contract can be conditional on payment 
* Exchanges/FX transfer (these services would be mad not to wait for confirmations)
* paying a trusted friend
Non RBF only really applies to point of sale, double spend risk is already very low for in person transactions anyway.  E.g. bars have security cameras

If the miners and community want larger blocks they can just kindly ask.  They could put a "safe larger blocks" flag in their block header for example.  I am sure we would have larger blocks by now if they did that.  The Core team kindly released a client with larger blocks anyway and they refuse to run it and refuse to listen to how SegWit is larger blocks.
Bluffing by threatening the system with a broken, buggy and fundemtally flawed client is not acceptable behaviour and as a community we should not tolerate this, otherwise the system will become vulnerable 
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:41:05
Sure.  But these problems occur even if regular users do not run nodes.  These problems apply to all nodes, including miner nodes
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:54:22
Please ask an actual question?
Do you mean do I think SegWit plus a hardfork to 2MB base data is a good idea?
I would say the following:
1. In general I would support a hardfork to increase the blockszie limit, however a hardfork is risky and therefore needs to occur is a calm, patient way not brought about by any threats.  For example "Hardfork in a safe way now or we will do a dangerous hardfork" is a totally unacceptable stance.  The network must be resilient against these kind of threats, in the future more powerful and sophisticated entities than the BU groups may make threats to try and change Bitcoin, therefore Bitcoin must be resilient against this tactic or its useless anyway.  Therefore I would say the current environment is not safe for a hardfork.  However, if the threats become insignificant, then yes, it may be safe to hardfork.  After-all, this was the point of the HK agreement, it said a hardfork should not be done without "broad support across the entire Bitcoin community".  Once we get back to that, it may be safe to hardfork.
2. Due to the quadratic scaling of sighash operations bug, I think we should stick to a 1MB limit for transactions with quadratic scaling of sighash operations, otherwise a malicious miner could produce an attack block that would take a long time to verify.  As Bitcoin grows, I think it is more and more naive to thing that such a malicious miner will not exists. I still think we should hardfork to a larger blocksize limit, but not for buggy transactions with quadratic scaling of sighash operations or buggy transactions subject to third party malleability.  This is one of the reasons why its good to do SegWit first, lets get these bugs which much larger blocks unsafe fixed first, then get larger blocks.

That means there is no diversity in EB values and BU does not function as a means of changing the blocksize.  Which seems to be the whole point of BU...
This attack vector applies when the EB mechanism in BU is used.  I do not understand the defense of saying, "Oh well, if its a weakness it will not be used anyway".  That defense can be used against any broken system.  My claim in simply that the EB and AD mechanisms in BU is broken.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:35:43
CLAMs had replay protection and wipeout protection.  XT/Classic/BU do not have these.

They can do that.
A majority of hashpower can impose new rules (softfork), they just cannot remove old rules (hardfork) 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:15:07


Yes there is: 
Once we get these hostilities behind us we can focus more attention into this research and getting the safe hardfork done in a calm, patient and collaborative way.
Until then, I think we should all oppose a potentially dangerous hardfork, especially BU, which has no safety mechanisms at all
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:37:20


A Core supporting miner could try to trigger BU earlier


This is a more complex issue than that.  Waiting to half way through could be just as likely to cause problems, as then the minority hash-rate chain would need to wait c1.5 adjustment periods to get back to 10 minute times rather than just 1 period


Ethereum's hardfork had c95% miner support, strong developer support and even the founder/leader supported it.  Yet ETC reached 30% of the price on two occasions.  Also I think the Bitcoin people have been around for longer and may be more patient
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:53:38


That is a very difficult thing to do without merge mining and its also politically difficult to get miners to attack.
Think about it, BU attack miners need to both keep the BU chain in the overall lead AND keep the 1MB attack chain longer than the legitimate 1MB chain at the same time.
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:39:33
Yes.  My understanding is that this analysis shows that in the past almost all BU flagging pools were running Core and "false flag attacking BU", except the Bitcoin.com pool.  Then pools actually started to run BU, now most BU flagging pools seem to run BU, except Slush  I think.
I am not sure what this analysis shows for Antpool.

Indeed.  This is why the UASF chain has the asymmetric advantage over the original  chain.  Therefore the UASF chain may attract investors and win in the end.  BU/XT have the opposite problem with the original chain having the advantage and could go "poof", this is why softforking can be an easier winning strategy.
So if we want to "win at all costs" in the blocksize war, maybe this aggressive UASF is a good idea.  However if we want to minimize risk for and protect Bitcoin, then I would not support this proposal.
 
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:34:47
ok, so there won't be this attack then
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:39:28


Why is that so important to people?
@_date: 2016-03-11 07:00:10
yes as Gavin said, one should wait at least 6 months for a hard fork to activate.  BIP103 was proposed over 6 months ago
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:07:03


Why would this apply to anything similar in the future?  What if the hardfork was done with:
* widespread support across the development community before it occurred, with all significant competing development teams implementing the hardfork 
* 95% miner threshold 
* widespread support from users and businesses before it occurred
* a 12 month grace period
* a checkpoint
* replay attack protection 
* prediction markets plus pre split trading showed the forked coins had 95% of the value
* there was a general attitude of patience, collaboration and respect amoung those advocating the hardfork 
For this kind of hardfork would you call it BTC (original symbol) from the first block?


Why not do the deciding beforehand to avoid all the volatility, chaos and confusion?  Refusal to do so seems hostile to me.


This potentially volatile and unpredictable process  is not acceptable to a considerable part of the ecosystem that relies on 24 x 7 uptime.  Please can we respect those people and therefore unite behind the principal of never supporting a hardfork without broad consensus across the community BEFORE it occurs.  This protects the integrity of the system by ensuring it's always up and available with no confusion for merchants, traders, users, new investors and existing investors.
          
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:33:37


Erik, please be reasonable and rational here.  Pushing for a hardfork without any of the basic and well known safety mechanisms is clearly at least irresponsible and at worst hostile:
* BU has no flag day
* BU has no wipeout protection
* BU has no miner activation threshold
* BU has no replay attack prevention
* BU had a bug enabling the remote shutdown of the nodes, yet not even for a minute do they rethink and advise people that BU is not ready to use yet
* BU’s EC mechanism is totally broken and vulnerable to attackers,  and this has been explained to them on many occasions and yet they keep pushing people to run this software
BU have been told to add these basic safety mechanisms again and again.  BU seem to insist on making the hardfork as dangerous as possible.  I think its clear now that they are hostile to Bitcoin.  Pretending otherwise is just no longer a reasonable position
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:26:59
To be honest the whole thing....
It just seems like a variant of BIP100.  There is no comment on BU
Everyone either follows the same BIP100 rules or not...
   
@_date: 2016-03-15 07:32:44


Well we are talking about two totally different things then.  If that is how miners are behaving they are acting in an inappropriate and irrational manner and I do not defend that.   That would mean Bitcoin incentives are not working.  Luckily there is no evidence that this is the case.  Of course this has nothing to do with the 1MB cap (an existing rule), I continue to hope miners enforce the 1MB and all existing rules until there is strong consensus to change them.


Then why is the majority of the hashrate still supporting 1MB then?  Why not listen to the theories of the people like me, who correctly said XT and Classic would fail, rather than those who incorrectly thought they would succeed?  I am based in Hong Kong/China and speak to the miners often.  I attended the "agreement" in Hong Kong.  The reason miners reject Classic is due to the activation methodology.  This is the same reason I reject Classic. 


BIP101 also had a 75% threshold.  BIP101 was rejected by a strong majority of the community, both due it its content and its activation methodology.  Classic is being rejected only due to its activation methodology and in contrast there is strong agreement on the content of Classic, in my view.


Implementation in July 2016 and then a 1 year grace period to allow nodes to upgrade.  
 &gt; If Core was responsibly handling capacity and scaling issues, and if there was a master plan for full blocks, then we'd be having this conversation back in 2013-2014 back when Gavin first broached the issue.
This debate has been ongoing since early 2011, not 2013.  Core is just a software project, it is run by volunteers and they don't have an obligation to do anything.


This issue has been debated extensively since 2011.  It has been mentioned that its not possible to test economics on the testnet.  The community only needs to accept changes to the consensus rules.


I like BIP100, however I have a different opinion to you with respect to timing.  My preference is for rolling 12 month changes under BIP100.  A longer period helps mitigate against a variety of attack vectors.


**BINGO!!**  Don't you understand, many of us in the community want to **avoid a contentious hardfork at all costs?  To me avoiding contentious hard forks is much more important than capacity increases, as it goes right to the heart of Bitcoin's core value proposition.**  Now clearly you do not agree with this.  All I ask is please be pragmatic, please respect our view and allow the shift to 2MB in a non contentious way, **rather than ADMITTING this is contentious and still pushing ahead anyway**.  This makes people call it an attack. That is driving the community apart and threatening a failure of the system, while it achieves nothing considering you can get 2MB anyway if you try to do it in a non contentious way.


Bitcoin is different from the American democracy.  That is what makes it different from the USD.  If you like that system use the USD, there is no point turning Bitcoin from something unique into something which already exists.


Yes it is, that is why Bitcoin converges onto the longest chain.  This is why PoW is very clever and superior to less convergent systems like PoS.  The incentives are set up to ensure miners work on the longest chain with the most hashing power.  This is why the XT/Classic people keep failing with their stupid counterproductive attacks, because they do not understand incentives.


But Classic cannot get to 75%, because miners want to stick together.


Yes it is.  I am being honest, it is really the root of my and the majorities argument.


I think any significant proportion of any part of the ecosystem should be able to veto a hard fork.


It is not one group of devs.  I am against Classic and I am not in the group of devs.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:39:50
Arguing that the third party transaction malleability bug is a good thing is ridiculous. It is me a bad bug that should be fixed.
Secondally, LN is likely to either:
* be a failure, such that it's irrelevant 
* be a popular success and therefore increase demand for onchain transactions to open and close channels
I do not agree that adding more use cases, such as instant transactions, is a negative or will cannibalize onchain demand.  
The developers  are trying to ensure we have an economically relevant blocksize limit to protect mining industry income, not undermine it.  Jihan appears not to trust the developers and will believe any negative story about them.   
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:31:19


Yes, you support BU right?  Do you know of the AD mechanism in BU?     The problem is some people seem to support BU without even understanding the basics.


That is not at all what I am talking about after BU is adopted, even by 100% of the nodes.  Also, BU has no mechanism to ensure the initial hardfork itself is safe.  Including basic safety features which seem like an absolute no brainer to me.  It seems like some people are ideologically driven to make the hardfork as dangerous as possible.


Lets say you have AD = 12 (the recommended setting), and an incoming transaction has 10 confirmations, yet another (larger block) longer chain is in the lead by 1 block.  If that longer chain gets 12 confirmations, you could have your incoming transactions double spent, despite 11 confirmations.
There are also many other examples like this.


I will try to explain the median EB attack.
A malicous miner could pick the middle value of the EB settings of all the other miners.  The malicious miner could then find one block, this would then split the hashrate 50/50.
@_date: 2017-03-29 05:50:05
In my view there should be two flags:
* BIP148 Support, and
* BIP148 (Active)
The campaign for BIP148 can then occur in two phases:
* Phase 1 - Campaign to get support for BIP148, in this phase the "BIP148 Support" flag should be used by nodes and miners
* Phase 2 - If phase one is successful, and there is overwhelming support across the community for BIP148, then people should run the client that actually enforces BIP148
In my view we should wait for consensus before running a client that enforces the new rule, otherwise this could cause a risky chainsplit with uncertainty.  Perhaps promotion of a client that enforces the new rule, prior to consensus, will be banned here on @_date: 2016-03-01 13:07:16
No the attack would be cheaper.  The worst case scenario of the attack (the spam getting on chain) would be fully realised at a lower cost.
The memory pool is a temporary issue and a line of defence before getting onto the main chain of permanent storage.  Your argument is like saying we should defend against a shooter by getting rid of the shield and standing out in the open so the attacker wastes more bullets by shooting you.

@_date: 2017-03-08 02:55:54


No I am not.  I like non binding miner preference signalling.


Because we need strong consensus across the entire community before a hardfork happens.


Yes.  This is better, because once miners show strong support for something, we can work on getting support from other parts of the ecosystem.  I consider anyone trying to force a hardfrok on the community before consensus an attack and therefore will not support a hardfork if done that way.


Nothing.  A hardfork must not be done without widespread support, or Bitcoin is pointless.


For a hardfork I think we need widespread support across the community.  More precisely I would say there should be **no significant opposition.**
For example:
* No significant opposition from all significant development teams
* Widespread support across the general community, with no notable objections from significant exchanges or businesses
* Strong support from the miners and a high miner threshold as a safety mechanism
* High levels of support from the users and node operators


One month is far too short.  I agree with Gavin in December 2013 when he said at least 12 months, or Satohsi's 10 months example.  As for safe there are various ideas:
* Soft-hardfork - e.g. a softfork forcing miners to upgrade for the hardfork
* Changing parts of the header to ensure upgrades
* Merge mining attack on the old chain
* High c95% miner threshold for safety
* Replay attack defense
* A checkpoint so the new chain cannot be wiped out (i.e. unlike BU/XT with their total wipe-out idea)
*  A long c12 month grace period
BU does none of these, even the most basic safety mechanisms


Not true, only miners do the binding vote. We need to give non mining nodes time to upgrade.


Where was your opposition to the 4 softforks activating with 95%?
They only have the power to prevent change


Sure.....  And to hardfork strong consensus is required across **ALL** groups....


This is your view.  I will do anything possible to revive the old chain if their is a hostile hardfork.  I am probably a lot more patient than you think.


That is not what I mean.  I am talking about things like:
* Segwit is not a blocksize limit increase
* Segwit adds technical debt
* Segwit adds a risk of funds being stolen due to anyone can spend hack
These are malicious clearly false things


* the devastating median EB attack.  This is a very simple attack where a malicious miner chooses the middle value of the other miner EB values, to split the network hashrate 50/50 at will.  This devastating attack causes a c4h shutdown of the network and damages the integrity of the system.  A miner with just 0.7% of the hashrate can make the network unusable.
* Ironic median EB attack using the sticky gate - Triggering the median EB attack then triggers half of the sticky gates.  Now you do the attack again and the larger blocksize miners are on a smaller block chain and vica versa.
* Undermining multiple confirmations
* regarding the shorter chain as the one true chain in some circumstances - For example, if you have AD =12 (recommended setting) and EB =2MB, your wallet regards a transaction in a chain with 8 confirmations as valid, despite a longer chain with say 11 confirmations being in the lead. Then the 12th confirmation occurs and you jump to the longer chain, then the money that had 8 confirmations has been wiped from your wallet
* Making having a wallet or exchange far more complex by needing to set AD or EB settings.  This makes the system unusable.  There are also no safe AD or EB settings to choose.  This is a fundamental change in the user experience, making Bitcoin an active and complex process.
* Removing machine consensus and replacing it with "social consensus", which does not scale
BU is totally broken and fundamentally flawed.  It is the worst idea, which is a result of extremist clever political operators in the Core team undermining more reasonable ideas like Classic and allowing only extremely obviously broken idea to remain standing, to help defend Core.


Based on historic actual transaction data its 2.1MB.


You do not even need to wait for anyone else to upgrade.  You alone can upgrade and get the instant benefits of an 80% capacity increase immediately.
Segwit's capacity increase is **much faster** than a hardfork, where you **actually do** need to wait for everyone to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:54:28


I would like to see a proper more detailed writeup before saying this has been solved.
BIP100 itself solves this problem, I support the core idea of BIP100.  From what I read combining this with BU in the way a link you provided earlier seemed to open up many new attack vulnerabilities without solving the exisitng BU ones.

@_date: 2017-03-17 23:10:41


It is great to hear that.  Please appreciate that c30% of the hashrate is either running BU of false flagging BU.  BU is a very poor protocol idea which is fundamentally flawed. At the same time the BU team has not implemented anything to mitigate the risks of doing a hardfork.  For example ETH had a checkpoint, to ensure a clean break, BU has refused to do this.  Why is it you think they have not done that? 
Such a large percentage of miners running BU is a major security risk.  As a long time Bitcoin holder and supporter of Bitcoin, I feel compelled to speak out against BU and try to protect Bitcoin.  The fact that it has taken exchanges and other industry players so long to speak out resoundingly against BU is a major concern for me and I am therefore questioning the whole idea of Bitcoin.
There is clearly a genuine dispute in the community, over how to hardfork and the risk vs reward of larger block compared to smaller ones.  However, we have allowed the dispute to open up a wipe gap in the community, which opponents of the system have capitalised on by jumping in the gap and pushing very flawed software (BU).  Whatever your stance is on the blocksize, the community needs to take a much stronger stance against BU and show that Bitcoin is resilient against these kind of risks.  If we cannot get together and effectively make the BU risk insignificant, then I have little hope for the long term future of Bitcoin.  The next hostile client may have a better marketing campaign, more resources, a less obviously broken protocol idea, fewer bugs and smarter developers.  I think we need to kill off this attack now and show we are strong, or there is little hope left.  How will we stop the next dangerous client and campaign for people to run that?  How will we stop the goverments and miners aligning together in 20 years time as they try and stop a block reward halving?  We must show contentious hardforks cannot be done, as the community will not allow it.


I would also support a hardfork to increase the blocksize limit beyond the new 2MB limit in SegWit.  However, it should be done in a calm, collaborative and patient way.  The idea of a political campaigns to push for a contentious hardfork must be proven to be ineffective if Bitcoin is to have a bright long term future.
Everyone I have spoken to wants larger blocks.
Lets get to over 2MB with SegWit and then lets work on the hardfork in a calm and patient way.  We should use all the existing safety mechanisms and invent new ones.  We should use the 10 month grace period and flag day idea like Satoshi said (unlike BU). Lets make this hardfork safer than ever.
Erik, please join the campaign for a safe and patient hardfork, only to be done with widespread support across the entire community.  Lets stop these aggressive campaigns for a rushed, dangerous and contentious hardfork.
 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:46:24
SegWit is already 2MB...
When you say hardfork, what do you mean, just moving the commitment to the block header?  What are the advantages of that?
@_date: 2016-03-22 07:02:46


No, the chart shows that as more blocks are found the probability of the chain with blocks smaller than 1MB being in the lead **increases**, gradually building up to 21%.  The combinations and permutations ( get quite complicated, but I think my maths is correct.
All Classic miners (100%) will build on top of blocks smaller than 1MB, whilst only c75% will build on top of  blocks larger than 1MB. Therefore, as soon at the less than 1MB block chain has a lead, it wins. In contrast as soon at the greater than 1MB block chain has a lead, it only has a c79% chance of winning.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:17:01
Yes everyone agreed FSS-RBF &gt;&gt; opt in RBF.  Then people started to try and implement FSS-RBF in a wallet and they could not.  If someone can implement it then great.  Right now there is no implementation and nobody says they can do it, its as simple as that.

Miners add an EB flag to their blocks, this is the limit to the size of blocks the miner will build on if its produced.
In BU everyone just sets their own blocksize limit, there is no mechanism in place to ensure network participants have the same rules

Well Gavin could have brought it forward by say 6 months and then it would be activated in a few months time.  But instead he wasn't willing to be reasonable and negotiate.


This is panic and FUD.  We must make these difficult engineering decision in a calm and patient manner.  We should not rush things.  Do you not see how demanding tings now makes half the community worry and against the proposal, because we want to do things in a careful patient way?  This is counterproductive and causes more delays.


95% activation and a 6 month grace period.  I agree with what Gavin said in 2013, that 6 months was a bare minimum.


Everybody needs to install a new client.  Classic was introduced c30 days ago and around 75% of the network are on Core.  This shows 28 days is ridiculously low.


1. Listen to technical objections
2. Don't accuse the other side of being biased in crazy conspiracy theories
3. Allow a non binding miner vote
4. Increase the grace period
5. Increase the activation threshold to one used before
6. Be respectful and be willing to cancel the hardfork if there is not strong consensus
7. Non binding node operator voting
8. Non binding bitcoinocracy voting
Currently 95% of blocks are for Core, 75% of nodes are for Core, 85% of investors are for Core, 85% of active developers are for Core.  Yet despite this clear majority support for Core, you mention you don't know how to be more reasonable and keep pushing for a HF!!


Once 95% vote then thats a strong indication to implement the HF.


They decided to support Core.  But people didn't accept this and still want a vote.  Lets have a non binding one then.  I would even want mines to flag support for 2MB in this vote.  I would also switch my nodes to support this.  This is how you get consensus and win.  Or would you rather cause division and lose?


Yes! almost everyone wants 2MB.  But almost everyone disagrees with the Classic activation methodology!  Do you not see, a resolution to this crises is so easy!  It is pathetic.


Because most people want to avoid a chain split at all costs.  That is why 28 days and 75% are so dangerous.  To be honest, I personally couldn't care if the current limit was anywhere 200KB to 10MB right now, avoiding a chain split is 1,000,000x more important to me than the current blocksize limit.  Therefore I very strongly oppose the 75% activation threshold ad 28 days for the HF.  Please can you respect my view and others who agree with me, then you will get your blocksize increase.


They wont have the power to ignore it if there is strong 95% support or we go ahead with a 95% activation threshold.  A minority do have the power to stop the HF, if the majority is not strong.  It must not happen immediately as some node operators will not upgrade.  People like me will not upgrade out of principal to defend against HFs with this activation methodology.


He confuses incompatible and compatible implementations.  I read all his comments, including his offensive remarks.


I am a user.  I demand that Core does not implement a HF without strong consensus.  This is also want all data shows the majority want.


100% agree. (dont confuse this with an HF)


Lets have more competing compatible implementation then


Exactly, Classic advocates are scared of defeat because they lack confidence


If the bitcoin protocol can be determined by a majority vote it has failed and I am leaving. It would have lost all its unique properties compared to the USD.


There is already strong consensus for 2MB!


As I said "hitting the limit" or "supply always above demand", is an economically flawed concept.  The market clears wen supply = demand.


Gavin could have asked for that and got it if he wanted

Exchanges should also carry a lot of warnings when listing the BU coin.  This is because BU coin has no “wipeout protection”.  If Bitcoin ever has more work than BU coin, then all BU coins acquired after the fork will vanish from existence.  This makes investing in this coin very risky and exchanges should warn their customers about this risk.
In addition to this, the exchange will also have the difficulty of deciding which AD and EB setting to choose for their BU node.  These settings may also need to be communicated to customers.

If the revokation is successful then obviously this doesnt matter.  The recipient returns the specific coins that were received in the RBF transaction.


No.  The CPFP is to allow the merchant to return the funds with no fee.  If the RBF transaction gets confirmed before revokation, the sender can then spend the merchants zero fee return transaction with a fee, so it gets confirmed

In order not to be a hardfork, all the transaction data would be in the blockchain as an anyone can pay transaction.  I think what trembly was saying was if the softfork was amazingly efficient, then all the transaction data could be in one transaction, saving space.

In a hypothetical version of BU that doesn't exist, yes it could be done in BU.  But it isn't.  BU is a broken idea as it stands and those encouraging people to run it and at best irresponsible and probably hostile to Bitcoin.  It is possible, in theory, for it to almost totally change and become a good idea, but the same is true for any broken idea.


No.  The system would need a lot of other changes to be anywhere near safe.
1. A new signalling system, like you say
2. A threshold for the signalling system
3. A lock in period and then checkpoint, for a period after the threshold was met
Then totally remove the  AD and EB mechanisms, these systems only make things worse, in my view.

Sorry I really do not follow.
What are you trying to say?
The way are see it you mean one of three things:
1. SegWit MAX_BLOCKSIZE softfork to over 2MB, plus moving the commitment to the header to make it a hardfork
2. Segwit MAX_BLOCKSIZE softfork to over 2MB and a hardfork to 2MB of non witness data
3. Segwit MAX_BLOCKSIZE softfork to over 2MB plus moving the commitment to header plus also adding another pointless bit to the header to make it incompatible anyway.
Which one do you mean?  As  far as I can tell, option 3 is just as pointless (if not even more pointless) than option 1.

BIP100, miner voting. 


Classic had unsafe activation methodology.  For example a 28 day grace period rather than 10 months like Satoshi suggested.  If it had reasonably safe activation methodology I would have supported it.  However the irrational insistence on appearing to want to make the hardfork as dangerous at possible was suspicious to me


That is false, it does the opposite.


More simple and logical format....


That is also false. 


BIP100.  That way we have consensus on the blocksize, while it is still dynamic and market driven.  The idea of everyone setting their own blocksize, such that the chain keeps diverging is ridiculous.

The problem is this is a very difficult and contentious issue after various attacks on the network, trying to hardfork a blocksize increase without consensus.  These attacks have forced developers to decisivly rally behind the status quo and defend the network.  Any hardfork in this area now requires an even higher level of consensus than it did before, which is challenging to achieve.  Therefore developers have chosen to keep the 1MB limit for now and softfork a capacity increase instead.

But Ethereum had a flag day, which was effectively "wipe-out protection"
BU has no “wipe-out protection”. If Bitcoin ever has more work than BU coin, then all BU coins acquired after the fork will vanish from existence. This makes investing in this coin very risky and exchanges should warn their customers about this risk.

Great post.  Trying to do a contentious  hardfork and then giving the original chain a massive asymmetric advantage over you by allowing it to wipe you out, is a bad idea, in my view.
Please try to understand how compelling investing in the original chain in an "asymmetric hardfork" situation  is for speculators.  Consider the below example:
Bitcoin Core coins vs BU coins:
* Step 1. BU gets 75% miner support and a 1.1MB block is produced
* Step 2. 24 hours later there has only been 30 Bitcoin Core blocks vs 110 BU blocks. BU people think they have won
* Step 3. An altcoin exchange lists both coins. BU Coin trades at $500 and the original coin trades at $1
* Step 4. Speculators and hardcore Bitcoin Core supporters start to buy the original coin with their BU coins, and the price begins to rally. People say its the "original/real Bitcoin" 
* Step 5. Like Ethereum Classic did to Ethereum on two occasions, the original coin reaches 30% of the price of BU coins
* Step 6. The original coin hashrate begins to climb to match the price. Some miners start using software that automatically mines the most profitable coin
* Step 7. Since the BU developers may not be as smart as Vitalik, they didn't put a checkpoint into the BU software. If original bitcoin ever takes the lead, the BU clients will switch to the original  chain and the BU coins, BU supporters were buying, will cease to exist. The price of the original coins would then rally
* Step 8. Traders start to realize this, there is a huge trading frenzy and then its game over.
* Step 9. Early buyers of the original coins made huge profits. Please note, this community has many short term speculators that like nothing more than large short term gains and don't  care about blocksize politics
             
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:20:29


No, I do not think so.
There was a proposal to do something similar from the author of SegWit here, creating a new additional extended header: 
@_date: 2016-01-05 12:18:52
It could work like this:
* When requesting payment, the paynent terminal could specify it will not accept RBF paymemts
* When the RBF transaction is recieved the payment terminal does not indicate a payment has been received and automatically  returns the money
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:31:42
 &gt; From what I know about it, it sounds like an acceptable idea. Lots of miners have been signalling BIP100 for some time.
BIP100 has 65% miner support at one point


Even GMax said "it was not a bad idea".  However the attacks have been continued so I felt no option but rally behind the 1MB rule until the attacks to HF without consensus stopped.
Instead of supporting a bad idea liek BU, please support a good one...


But SegWit is a softfork, so nodes are not required to upgrade.  Actually segwit is even safer than that, its a new type of softfork when even miners are not required to upgrade


28 day grace period and 75% thresholds.  Then BU with no safety mechanism whatsoever.  At the same time I see no downside of the safety mechanisms. 


They are being malicious or political


This is nothing like orphan blocks, these are invalid (or with BU partially valid) blocks, that is totally different form orphaning.  Orphaning is a random process that only occurs if a rare coincidence happens, this is not the case with invalid blocks.  The invalid block forks therefore last longer and give more opportunity for multi confirmation double spend.
Deliberately confusing people by saying its liek normal orphaning is dangerous.  This is why BU is such a bad and divergent idea.


Please stop supporting BU then.  Lets do an actual working solution like BIP100.  We need to speak out against BU or it may happen and destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:45:03
For a hardfork, I would say "no significant opposition"
For practical purposes, this could mean a 95% miner threshold is ok
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:30:36
Ok thanks.  How do you know?  Is that based on this CPFP analysis?
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:37:09
Yes.  That's what BU's AD mechanism is all about 
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:41:25
There are many ways BU enables this.  But let me give one example:
* You are a merchant and run a BU node with EB=1MB and AD=12 (the recommended setting)
* A miner tries to increase the blocksize limit, and produces a 2MB block
* Somebody makes you a payment, which is confirmed in the 1MB chain
* The payer is aware of the competing 2MB chain, and sends a conflicting transaction which gets confirmed in the 2MB chain
* The 1MB chain is extended by 8 blocks and the merchant wallet sees 8 confirmations and delivers the goods.  At the same time the 2MB chain is extended by 10 blocks and is in the lead, but the merchant's node does not see this chain.
* The 2MB chain then gets 2 more confirmations.  Your local node then reaches the AD threshold and dumps the 1MB chain and your incoming funds are removed from your wallet, despite having 8 confirmations
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:47:17


I would say it is hostile due to the lack of basic safety mechanisms, despite some safety mechanisms being well known.  For example:
* BU has no miner threshold for activation
* BU has no grace period to allow nodes to upgrade
* BU has no checkpoint (AKA wipe-out protection), therefore users could lose funds
* BU has no replay attack prevention
Other indications BU is hostile include:
* The push for BU has continued, despite not before fixing critical fundamental bugs (for example the median EB attack)
* BU makes multi conf double spend attacks much easier, yet despite this people still push for BU
* BU developers/supporters have acted in a non transparent manner, when one of the mining nodes produced an invalid block, they tried to cover it up or even compare it to normal orphaning.  When the bug that caused the invalid block was discovered, there was no emergency order issued recommending people to stop running BU
* Submission of improvement proposals to BU is banned by people who are not members of a private organisation
Combined, I would say this indicates BU is very hostile to Bitcoin


Yes miners are free to run software they want.  In my view they SHOULD not run BU.  However they CAN run BU.  Just because they CAN does not mean they SHOULD

There will not be a hardfork as a result of threats, or bitcoin is pointless and there is no monetary integrity.

In the example there were two chains, then the 1MB chain vanishes and does not survive

@_date: 2016-03-01 22:24:38


Good, I hope we agree then.  At least we both think the Classic activation methodology is not appropriate 
@_date: 2016-03-16 03:40:46


You can do double the UTXO damage per unit time.  Also the cost will be lower as fees may be lower 


This ignores all the externalities.  These are costs of larger blocks not incurred by the miner who mines it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:11:54


Yep, look at December 2015.  Bitfury supported it


Because the XT attack continued.


I like votes.  For example BW.com voting for 8MB.  I think that is great.  XT/Classic and BU are not just votes, they stop enforcing the rule before consensus, I regard that as a hostile attack.


Miner voting would be a good start...


Again.  Please vote. BU/XT are not votes, they actually stop enforcing the rules


Yes.  Not enough consensus for a hardfork.


If BIP100 was implemented and then people started to run it, before consensus or before a safe activation methodology, then yes, I would consider it an attack.


There are so many things one can do:
* Non binding miner voting
* Implementation
* Testnet
* Community discussion
Then, if there is still contention from some developers, make the activation extra extra safe:
* 12 month grace period
* 95% softfork activation, in a soft-hardfork
* Changing the header format to ensure all miners have upgraded before the actual hardfork activation
ect ect


Well that is just nonsense.  You have read malicious propaganda


95% is just very cautious.  Core have done 5 softforks with this 95% threshold.  One was donbe with a 55% threshold in the past, with this same "anyone can spend" none issue.


Which experience?  Remember, August 2010 and March 2013 were not hardforks.  The hardforks which did occur had long grace periods


Without merge mining you need c90% to block transactions in the old chain.  With merge mining is exactly what Core are planning.


51% can technically softfork.  As for a hardfork, 51% means little, unless they do a merge mining attack on the old chain


I am talking about clearly false information.


Just because you are not afraid, doesnt make BU any less stupid of an idea.


Segwit is more than 2MB!!! 
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:50:27

Yes, 12 confirmations from the block greater than your local EB in size


Well the attacker may know the block larger than you EB




No it doesnt, both chains do not need to survive


No they don't.  Also the 2MB chain must always be longer, or it doesnt exist


No, they can do this while the 1MB chain is shorter


In this example yes, but it could work for another EB...


Not really, the cost of trying this attack is almost zero.  Might as well flood the mempool with hundreds of double spend attempts.


This is why nobody should run BU


No reason not to do this...
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:44:29
No it does not.  A chainsplit is not a hardfork 
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:23:12
Well it is kind of better.  For example 2x5 minute blocks, may statistically be "better" than 1x10 minute block in some security respects.  Not that I advocate a target time reduction now, but I don't think its as simple as security being directly proportional to the amount of work.
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:09:26


Well, it would shut the network down for an expected 4 hours when AD=12.  For a network like Bitcoin uptime is absolutely vital.  The ability to shut the network down like this effectively ends the system.  (not to mention all the other problems like double spend attacks ect)


It is not just signalling!!  It is actual enforcement, that is the problem.  Everyone setting their own rules like this just causes the network to diverge and fail
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:35:28
People are used to having a leader.  They therefore look for a leader of Bitcoin, and Core or even you, seem to be good targets for them.
People also like disruption and rebellion.  So after they found a leader, they can rebel against them, unfortunately, in the case of Bitcoin, before they work out their is no leader. 
This is why BTU coin has a president.  That feels about right to a lot of people  as a lot of things have a president.  
Brand is also important to a lot of people.  Many of the BU supporters and Core oponents are not basing the decision on anything technical.  They just like the BU brand, as it's associated with rebellion or something else in their minds.  BU could completely change, even to something sensible, and they could still support it, as they are fans of the BU brand.

@_date: 2017-03-07 04:37:43


Well lets do a better idea then.


I agree, first we get consensus and then we implement it in code.....


Well once we get to that point it could already be a huge crisis that is already damaging the integrity of the system.  But if BU wants this, then why is there no replay attack defense in BU and why does BU coin cease to exist if it loses the lead, making the trading war unwinnable?
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:13:11
One thing you could do is the following:
* Deposit fund's in an N'locked time 2 of 2 multi signature wallet.  The wallet provider has 1 key, the user has 1 key, and the funds will be returned fully to the user in say 2 months time.
* The wallet provider will sign any transaction when the user completes the 2FA, however they promise never to sign a double spend. (Green address does this)
* You can then accept payments instantly, without worrying about double spends
This is an actual solution to your problem. 


Non full blocks does not really help, as blocks can take over an hour to find anyway.


Sounds like you need a payment channel for that.
No offence, but I would rather use cases like this **are** priced off chain.  This is essentially "Gamified eCommerce" (  I would rather not store and verify all your game data on my home PC.  If Bitcoin allowed this, everyone would make games like this and then normal users would not be able to use Bitcoin locally. I enforce a 1MB limit on my economic node, to help prevent stuff like this getting on the chain I use.
You could do this on Ethereum instead.  Maybe put all the game on a smart contract and make it trustless
@_date: 2016-03-22 14:11:36
And that would mean there is no future mining incentives 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:00:58
Err.  It means there is technically less work and more upfront coordination 
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:59:46


No it is not the case normally at all. 
Of course, “orphaned blocks” do already exist, and users that require more security should wait for more confirmations.
But barring exotic and expensive types of malicious attacks, three orphaned blocks can currently really only result from freak coincidence. Different groups of miners must coincidentally find three blocks at almost exactly the same time, three separate and subsequent coincidences, in order for the network to experience that many orphans.
Bitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, throws a new factor into the mix, adding a reason for the network to experience three orphaned blocks. Miners not only race to extend the longest valid chain, but also vote on protocol rules between chains. This process would also be visible and quite predictable for attackers, and therefore easily exploitable.


They essentially DDoS Bitcoin and damage the integrity of the currency.  This is not temporary at all, with just 0.7% of the hashrate you can do this once per day, essentially making the network totally unusable.




What!  I can generate as many transactions as I like.  I can just spend the same 1 btc over and over again, 10,000x.


That requires human intervention, destroying the whole machine consensus invention of Bitcoin


That is why we need a blocksize limit, to prevent this....  Why dont we just get rid of the limit instead of introducing a divergent BU system?


No, totally false.


No, the cost of making the extra data is essentially zero.
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:21:39
Will 0.13 be the first version when the client can send SegWit transactions?  I presume it's vital to prevent people sending SegWit transactions before the softfork activates as otherwise the money will be stolen.

What do you mean by "SegWIt hardfork"?  You mean SegWit but adding a pointless  incompatible bit to the header, just so its a hardfork?  All the extra risk but no benefit


SegWit results in an effective and actual blocksize greater than the 2MB people were asking for
@_date: 2016-03-11 05:47:14
Yeah.  BIP103 could have been implemented or even activated by now.  Unfortunately it just wasn't possible for the Core team to support BIP103 activation while the attacks were ongoing, otherwise the network could have split into 3.

Do you accept in principle that a broken protocol idea is possible?
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:43:26
I agree with you.
However, as you know BU supporters have been pushing for a chainsplit for a while.  BU has significant miner support and many believe that these miners could cause a chainsplit.
If in the near future it looks like the chainsplit appears imminent and this is causing problems, chaos and confusion, yet the chainsplit still does not occur.  Then it could be a good idea to do BIP148 to get the looming threat of a chainsplit out of the way instead of letting it cause problems and division by looming over the ecosystem.  Yes this is a risk, but the BU issue is providing a big gap in the community, allowing enemies of Bitcoin to jump in and cause problems. 
We cannot allow this constant threat of a chainsplit to linger over us indefinitely.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:36:20


BU does not have a threshold... I don't understand what you mean here


The grace  period needs to be implemented.  Announcing it doesn't help much.  As BU stands now it has no grace period and is dangerous, despite this people run it.  Future plans to make it safer are great, people should not run BU now while it's dangerous 


Again,  I am saying BU as it stands is dangerous and hostile.  I am not commenting on a hypothetical piece of software that does not exist.  People should not run the current BU
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:20:58
 &gt; It does not allow for lower fees. All it does it allow for low-balling, then engaging in a bid war for block space. 
This low balling is more efficient than guessing a higher fee upfront.  Therefore fees will be lower as the market is more efficient 


I explained the FSS issue, the FSS system cannot be implemented due to this issue.  If you can implement it please do and I am sure Core will adopt this instead of opt in RBF.


Mining is not competitive now and miners do care about a healthy ecosystem.  What happens in the future if mining is highly competitive and each miner has a 0.1% market share?  Miners may then adopt policies to help themselves in the short term, not the whole system, partly due to the classic tragedy of the commons problem.  I appreciate you recognise these arguments will be relevant in the future.  I think we should plan now, we are already over 70% through the block reward.


0 conf should not be used in certain circumstances like ecommerce or buying airline tickets, for example.  Please let me know why you need 0 conf to order a book on Amazon?


Please implement this then.  It will get merged in Core if it works

It is hostility, I have read comments about:
* punishing Core
* rejecting for political reasons 
* don't like Reddit moderation 
Since these reasons are not in the best interest of the system, it's clearly hostile to the network

No, it stores then in the same way, in the block.  It does help make pruning easier later on, but that is only an option

No.  There was a softfork which Satoshi did to add a 1MB limit which was accepted by the network.  This is now a consensus rule and removing it without widespread support across the entire community causes an altcoin.  
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:59:58
We have not won the argument.  The BU supporters are driven by things such as ego, power, rebellion, brand, censorship on Reddit, emotions ect.  It doesn't matter to them what the BU client actually does on a technical level or how it behaves.  The BU supporters do not focus on technical factors, most of them have not evaluated the AD mechanism and therefore don't care how broken it is.  I do not think we can win by demonstrating technical flaws, showing the protocol idea is fundemtally broken or even all the BU repeatedly  nodes going offline.
Unfortunately I think the best we can hope for is the BU supporters lose considerable funds.  For example, either they install a closed source client that  steals all their funds or there is a chain split and the BTU coin they buy loses value.  Unfortunately the above seems to be our best hope.
However, even if they do suffer economic losses, perhaps this issue will continue and we still won't win the argument

@_date: 2016-01-06 16:59:09

@_date: 2016-01-06 11:26:31
Unfortunately I still don't think you get it.  RBF is Replace By Fee, by definition this replaces a lower fee transaction by a higher fee one.  If a mimer adopts the RBF policy, they get this higher fee and increase profits in the next block.
Yes in the long term is may lower miner profits.   This is why I tried to explain the tragedy the commons issues.

You mentioned they were attack transactions in the comment I was replying to.


If the blocksize limit increases to 2MB and the spammer had the objective of outbidding and delaying say the bottom 40% of transactions, the attack just got much cheaper.  In addition to this the attack also does more damage to the blockchain and UTXO, a far more serious issue than temporary mempool stuff.


We need to accept that when/if bitcoin becomes popular there will always be a lot of "spam".  Therefore all blocks will be full and we need to be very cautious and prudent when it comes to increasing the blocksize, so that only transactions with a sufficient fee get on the chain and the chain does not get too large.  
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:20:26


I thought you said you were not politically attached to a hardfork and just want a capacity increase?  SegWit is a capacity increase and blocksize limit increase.  How can you call SegWit irrelevant with respect to this?


SegWit is a blocksize increase in Q2 2016.  What you want has happened.
In addition to this, what you demand just happened recently to the non witness data in Hong Kong.  The statement said a HF will be implemented and recommended to the Core team by July 2016, with a blocksize increase of non witness data to around 2MB.  Activation will occur as soon as safely possible, which is around 12 months later.  Almost everyone was unhappy with the agreement, but it was a fair compromise in the middle.
Within minutes of the announcement Brian Armstrong of Coinbase began complaining.  Instead he should have taken a few weeks to cool off and think about it like Gmaxwell. 
Core cannot promise a HF as it requires all nodes to upgrade.  Members of the Core team promised to implement the code, which is all they can promise.

The BU plan is to only create their coin if they have more work.  I think thats a bad idea, but an even worse idea is that they automatically abandon the BU coin if it has less work, making BU coin very risky

Firstly AD is now 12.  Therefore EB=1MB miners can get 12 blocks orphaned, which would take an expected 4 hours.  There would be no warning for users and they could see funds wiped from their wallets after 11 confirmations.
After this then all the EB = 1MB miners would have their sticky gates triggered, whilst all the EB = 1.1MB would have their sticky gates closed.  Now a malicious miner can split the hashrate 50/50 again.  This time the smaller blockers ironically on the larger block chain and vica versa.  It would be a massive confusing mess

That is not the attack I meant.  A 51% attack in this context would be malicous orphaning or mining empty blocks, that would be when we PoW change, not just when BTU exists


Also you are wrong in that this is a rejection of the current development team. Core wrote 99% of the code in BU.  If they want to reject that team and code they can run Bcoin, BTCD or some other implementation not written by the Core development team.   
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:10:29
A 6 block selfish mining attack is very different.  This is symmetric and the longest chain wins.  The BU situation is different, some  nodes regard one side of the chain as invalid, while some nodes regard both sides as valid.  That is an asymmetric situation.
There are of course other differences

That is all the "Core supporters" have been saying all this time.  First we have non binding signals, then once we have broad support, we then do the hardfork at a set point in the future.  This is exactly what BU does not do.
This whole argument was caused by people, like BU, changing the rules they enforce before we have such agreement/non binding signalling process.  Then having a policy of banning people promoting the running of clients that do not enforce the rules before we have the agreement/consensus/non binding voting process


Exactly!!!  That is what "Core supporters" have been saying all along.  This is the only known security model that works
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:29:23


These points are potential problems with hardforks that **have** been mostly solved, which are not implemented by BU.
To clarify:
* BU has no miner threshold for activation - This is not a generic problem for all hardforks.  A hardfork could include a miner activation threshold
* BU has no grace period to allow nodes to upgrade - This is not a generic problem for all hardforks, this problem was solved by Satoshi in 2010.  A hardfork could include a grace period.  Like the 10 month grace period Satoshi suggested (
* BU has no checkpoint (AKA wipe-out protection), therefore users could lose funds - This is not a generic problem for all hardforks, for example Ethereum solved this with their contentious hardfork, when they had a checkpoint which was a clean break, preventing ETH from being wiped out
There are of course still many other problems and risks associated with hardforks, many of which have not been entirely solved and the Core team is working on them (  However, BU does not even implement the fixes to the problems which have seen mostly solved

This method is not BU.  The problem with BU is that this is not it.
BU is being run now by miners without this system.  What is your point, if BU changed it could be better?  Of course I agree with that.  The point is, as it stands, BU is very dangerous and irresponsible.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:10:31


That is not true.  There is no threshold in BU
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:47:14


Can you give a real world example of a good or service that costs less than $5, where you need to pay a high $0.70 fee, as you need the transaction confirmed in the next block?
Let me give you examples of when you do not need such urgency:
* Buying a coffee - I am sure the coffee shop owner trusts you enough not to double spend, and give you the coffee with 0-conf.  If you really wanted to you could run out of the shop and run down the street, without paying for the coffee at all.  Getting in the next block is therefore not necessary
* Buying a game online - This is likely to be reversible, therefore the goods can be delivered and the revoked (with an account ban) if you double spend.  Getting in the next block is therefore not necessary
* Ordering goods online - The company typically takes around 6 hours to give the instruction to the warehouse staff.  Getting in the next block is therefore not necessary 
* Hotel Booking - The hotel booking is normally in the future.  Getting in the next block is therefore not necessary.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:03:25


The whole point of Bitcoin is you cannot eliminate a rule by "force".  The opposite of what you say is true, almost everyone seems happy to hardfork, as long as its done safely and not by force/threats
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:34:59


No it doesn't.  The limit can be raised without opening up this vulnerability.


Lets say you increase the limit as follows:
* Step 1 - achieve strong consensus across the community
* Step 2 - release client that still enforces the 1MB limit for 10 months, then at a pre determined block number, increases the limit to 2MB
* Step 3 - Everyone runs this new client
For an example of this see Satoshi's quote, which explained exactly this...


     if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
     maxblocksize = largerlimit
Source: 
If this method is used, then miners are either all enforcing a 1MB limit or they are all enforcing a 2MB limit.  There is no window of opportunity for an attacker.
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:46:18
Please can you let me know which part is half true?
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:40:44


I agree, a miner dictated dynamic size limit like that in BIP100 would be good.


I do not agree with "using" orphan risk.  Orphan risk is bad for many reasons, including the wated work problem.  **Lets let technology make orphan risk low and not try to rely on it being high.**


There is no non complex choice.  Relying on Orphan risk is extremly complicated.  BU is very complicated.  BIP100 is reaosnably simple, the miners decide on what limit they want to apply.  The other complications are the result of complex analysis, if you analyse any system to a high degree of detail, it will be complex.  **Bitcoin incentives are complex, thats by Bitcoins very nature, we cannot avoid this.**

So you are pedantically saying hashcash is different, since apparently hashcash literally and directly used the number of leading zeros, where Bitcoin uses value (almost equivalent to, but less precise than, leading zeros)

Bitcoin also uses SHA2 and not SHA1.  But so what?  That's not the point

The recommended AD is 12 now!  12 confirmations would be unsafe
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:00:47


Block size signalling is fine.  This can be added with a custom field.  Nobody has a problem with that.
The problem is people stopping enforcement of the 1MB limit without consensus beforehand.
The EB setting in BU is not just a signal, its also lack of enforcement.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:46:31
Please post it...
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:51:18


Not only does it occur at a greater frequency.  It is also more predictable and easier to deliberately initiate, which could assist an attacker.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:31:56


For large AD, around 36%, I think.


No.  I think you mean reducing AD, but even then, no.
If AD = 0, then yes arbitrarily small (0%)


Once the attempts to hardfork in a contentious, stupid and dangerous way become insignificant, I think we can get consensus relatively fast


Even assuming step one fails, this method is still strictly better than BU.  


Well Core will do something much better/safer than that.  The first step is ending the attacks, then get 2MB with SegWit and then beginning to work on the safe hardfork

No, a hardfork or the launch of an altcoin can be done with any miner level of support.  There is nothing special about 50%. 
A softfork technically requires over 50%, however we use 95% as a shortcut and for extra safety precautions

Well leaving aside whether they are jackasses or not, since it seems we disagree.  The point is, it should not matter.  You never hear people saying:
* AC current would be the best system for our circuit, it would be cheaper, more efficient and more reliable.  However we will use DC since some of the guys who developed AC technology were jackasses
* The best way to determine the necessary  length of this cable is to use Pythagoras's theorem.  However, since I think Pythagoras was a jackass, I will waste money trying to establish the length using trial and error instead
* I think it would be cheaper and better for our company to create a website for marketing rather than a leaflet.  However since some of the people involved in html standards are jackasses, we will use a leaflet instead.

Err. Only if:
* the BIP148 chain is shorter than the original chain, **and**
* the BU chain is longer than both the BIP148 chain and original chain
do we have three chains.  This is probably unlikely.
(Basically the original chain can wipe out BU and BIP148 can wipe out both BU and the original chain)
If BU launches, we probably don't need BIP148.  But what if BU looks very  imminent, causes problems, but never actually happens?  That is when we may need BIP148 to end the matter.

We already discussed this point on Bitcointalk in 2014 I think.  A supply quota may hurt  suppliers  more than consumers, on the other hand it may not.  It depends on the shape of the supply and demand curves.  Look at monopoly pricing for an example.  It is definitely not true that a supply quota always hurts producers more than consumers, in all conditions 
Yes it would be good for you to put your thoughts here in a blog post.  Debate is healthy


The impact that the limit and price has on total fees is determined by the elasticity of demand.  Please stop trying to oversimplify this by implying a lower price always leads to higher aggregate fees.  It depends on the market conditions.  
This is why I think BIP100 is such a clever idea.  It allows miners to estimate the elasticity of demand to set the limit to maximise aggregate fees.  This solves the debate we are having.
@_date: 2016-06-28 03:16:07
Well it's my node and I can keep running it if I want.  If you or miners want to flag support for 2MB in a non binding way that is fine.  I just chose to support the existing rules during what I consider as an attack.
I appreciate it feels like a todler argument to you, but to me it's a crucial part of the incentive process which makes the system robust
I have always been in favour of dynamic solutions.  I support BIP100 and strongly oppose Bitpays median of the last n  blocks system, as miners can easily game it.  In fact miners can be incentived to just fill all the blocks up and keep increasing the limit.
@_date: 2016-06-27 22:54:26


There are many ways:
* non mining nodes flagging support for HF.  Once the attacks stop, I stand ready to add a support for 2MB flag in all of my non mining nodes.  I am sure many node operators agree with me
* miners flagging support for HF in the block header in a non binding way.  Some miners are doing this, unfortunately XT/Classic took away the momentum 
* People voting with their coins in favour of HF
* businesses writing letters in support of HF, but not counterproductivly saying they will run attack nodes which lock in 25% opposition at the time of activation thereby trying to HF without consensus 
* technical meeting in which there is broad consensus for HF
Once these things start to happen the devs will write the HF code as part of the process.  With a safe 95% activation threshold and 6 month or more grace period, I hope.  Please at least give consensus a chance.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:27:42
No it isn't.  BU does not adopt any basic safety mechanisms.  They even refuse to adopt this example by Satoshi  of how to increase the blocksize limit in a safer way.  BU insist on making the blocksize limit increase as dangerous as possible

I don't think miners have that much say with respect to hardforks.  For softforks miners can quickly activate them, but user wallets can also activate them if they want, it just takes longer as we need to wait for people to upgrade like for a hardfork

Well I think of it like this.  Let's say a company makes cars and there is a debate amongst the engineers as to whether to increase the size of the wheels from 1m to 2m.  One group of engineers says 2m is the correct size, instead of discussing it and getting consensus to change, they begin modifying their part of the production process such that it is incompatible with the rest of the car.  This results in chaos and no cars for anyone.  Instead of this the majority of engineers want an agreement and broad consensus before actually changing things.
@_date: 2016-06-27 22:49:06

It is not clear if people actually believe this or if they are deliberately spreading misinformation
Firstly LN and SegWit are two different things, conflating them like this is wrong.  There is a bad bug  in Bitcoin called transaction malleability, which allows a third party to change your transaction ID before it gets in the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a bad bug for a large number of reasons, for example making it  hard to forward funds  on and SegWit fixes this bug.  Fixing this bug also happens to make LN a bit easier to implement.  Arguing to keep this bug is clearly a ridiculous position.
Secondly LN is entirely voluntary and nobody will be forced to use it.  It may be possible there could be some large hubs, however even if this was the case it would not be as bad as a large bank for example, as the hub would be unable to access user funds, which is the whole point of LN

It is very different.
An invalid chain and a reorg caused by a coincidence of miners finding different valid blocks at the same time, are fundemtally different 
One difference is there are not two sides, with one able to be wiped out and the other immune from wipe out. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:26:54


SegWit2x does have wipeout protection for full nodes (but not for light clients.)
SegWit2x does not have replay protection.
As for "why", I have no idea.  The Segwit2x devs seem to totally ignore this issue every-time I ask.  In my view, the reason this feature is excluded may be because SegWit2x is a malicious hostile attack on Bitcoin.
Please ask the lead dev why he is excluding this.  I want the right to carry on using the old Bitcoin, Jeff should respect that without chasing chaos, just like I respect his right to use and invest in the new Bitcoin he is making.

Potentially very difficult to do and a huge mess right...
And what about normal users not trying to split?
What about attackers trying to exploit others and free replay coins?
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:11:22
If a majority of miners do not upgrade, this client may cause a chainsplit.
In my view we should try to avoid a chainsplit.  However the BU supporters and miners have been pushing for a client that would cause a chainsplit for a while.  It now looks like the miners are now getting ready to run BU and cause a chainsplit.  If we think BU is going to do a chainsplit anyway, then an argument can be made for moving this forward with a UASF, to get this destructive and divisive issue out of the way, sooner rather than later.       
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:48:49


But the plan should be as follows:
* Step 1 - Make good software ready for Bitcoin
* Step 2 - Advise people to run it
What makes BU hostile is that its supporters are encouraging people to run it when these issues have not been fixed.

That is possible, it depends on the elasticity of demand.  That is why I say let the market decide with miner voting
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:06:17


Right, but that is not the argument you were making for SegWit2x, you were making a political compromise argument. 
I think a coin where the rules are highly resilient, is the only model that scales and is sufficiently different to the USD.  If we need to compromise to try and keep people various people happy, I think you will find that model wont scale.  This is a legitimate disagreement.  If we have a disagreement over this, then fine.  You can invest in and use SegWit2x and I will chose not to.  That is my right.


Sure.  Add replay protection (including for light wallets) and let the market decide...
Fail to add replay protection, and the market will also decide, but it will be a lot messier and more destructive to innocent third parties.  Also, this mess won't necessarily help one side or the other, contrary to what many believe.


Core produces technology, I prefer them not to try to "get consensus".  They should just release technology.  It looks like c95% of economic nodes run core, so I am not sure what you mean that they were not able to get consensus anyway.

I think almost everyone would be happy to compromise, in a friendly collaborative way.
  
The trouble is compromising and doing a hardfork as a result of threats or aggression, if that happens it shows one can hardfork bitcoin by making threats and it's integrity as a currency is gone.
For example:
* "lets do a hardfork to 2MB or else we will hardfork to 4MB despite you being unhappy" - not acceptable and unlikely to be effective 
* "I would like a hardfork to 4MB, however I respect your right to veto the hardfork.  What about 2MB,  is that ok for you as a pragmatic compromise?" - totally acceptable and likely to be  effective

There is not overwhelming support for SegWit2x.  Actually the overwhelming majority opposes the SegWit2x hardfork
The economic majority has specifically indicated that they oppose a hardfork without strong 2 way replay protection.  SegWit2x does not have replay protection. 
**Statement from many Exchanges**


   
* Bitbank
* Bitfinex
* Bitstamp
* Bittrex
* BTCC (Also signed NYA, so needs to clarify their position)
* Coinfloor
* Kraken
* ShapeShift (Appears to support SegWit2x, so also needs to clarify position **Poloniex**






**Canadian Bitcoin Economy**


**Blockchainlab in Milan**


Bitcoin Cash (BCash/BCC/BCH/ABC/UAHF) has added replay protection, and therefore I genuinely wish them the best of luck with their new coin.  However, as a community, we have a duty to educate others and strongly oppose Segwit2x, as it is dangerous and irresponsible not to include 2 way replay protection enabled by default.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:54:09


No.  Not sure why one could say that
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:50:06


there might be, but most exchanges say they won't list Segwit2x coin, due to its poor implementation, as it stands


Segwit2x is the hardfork so it's the only one that can add protection, since adding this protection is a hardfork 


I don't think so, exchanges have already come out against an incompatible version without replay protection 


Anyone can call any chain they like Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:01:09
Replay protection needs to be mandatory, otherwise many won't opt in, including existing wallets.
If support for SegWit2x is the majority then the majority will upgrade.
Lack of replay will cause chaos.  Stop recklessly pretending otherwise

Its partly about intentions.  Many pushing for a hardfork openly say they want to do it and leave a significant number of unhappy people.  For example "break away from Core".  Core is one of the Bitcoin implementations, the developers of any significant implementation need to be on board for a hard-fork.  Once people accept this, the hardfork should be easy.  A 95% miner threshold should be sufficient.


Sure, it seem like a commitment to run SegWit if Core releases a hardfork.  I disagree with that, I think miners should only run SegWit if  they think its a good idea based on technical merit.  Nobody, including miners, should ever softfork Bitcoin as a negotiating tactic to get something else they want, if they do not want the softfork
However, the agreement does not say miners will not run SegWit if Core has not released a hardfork

* in BU, nodes can on occasions regard a shorter valid chain as the one true chain and reject a longer valid chain.  That is not Nakamoto consensus

If we want more space, there is an option available right now to double capacity and simultaneously improve efficiency so its safe to increase capacity even further.  Its called SegWit.  However, the community seem to prefer higher fees now instead.

@_date: 2017-01-29 15:29:07


The network needs to be improved and  upgraded.  That is not sad.  For example  Satoshi put in a 1MB blocksize limit, and the Core team have put forward a proposal to increase the limit to 2MB, to improve throughput  for users.  However although Core control one version of the client, Core do not control the Bitcoin protocol rules, so accepting the blocksize limit increase is up to the community   
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:52:23




It is based on both.  2016 blocks in a two week period.  The two week period is calculated from the time-stamps and there are various mechanisms to ensure the time-stamps are not cheating.

Segregated witness is a new major upgrade to the system.  The upgrade is a new way of spending Bitcoin, such that the signature that which signs the transaction is treated in a different way.  This has a number of benefits, including:
* **Large c110% onchain capacity increase (From a user perspective this occurs almost instantly)** - Bitcoin is becoming more popular and therefore fees to use the system are increasing.  This is a major concern to some users.  SegWit implements a large capacity increase of around c110%, it does this by increasing the amount of data in each block from c1MB to around 2.1MB.  This should lower the fees one needs to spend to use Bitcoin by a considerable amount.  The great thing about this is SegWit is a backward compatible change, therefore the capacity increase can occur very quickly.  As soon as a user upgrades, they get the benefits of more capacity without needing to wait for other users to upgrade.
* **Malleability fix** - When you send a transaction, it is possible for a malicious third party to modify it a bit, before it is included in the blockchain.  This can be a massive pain for users and this bug has caused huge problems in the past (See   For example if I receive bitcoin and I want to forward it on right away, its possible for someone to change the original transaction which would break my transaction that forwards it on.  This makes Bitcoin slower and harder to use.  SegWit fixes malleability.
* **Linear scaling of sighash operations** - As a transaction gets larger and larger, the time taken to verify the transaction rapidly increases, in a quadratic way.  For example, you could say doubling the size of the transaction increases verification time by 2 squared = 4 times.  This could be a problem as somebody could make a really big attack transaction, that would take so long to verify, many Bitcoin nodes could crash and be stuck.  There is currently a 1MB blocksize limit in Bitcoin, many people like me are worried about increasing this as otherwise somebody could make an even bigger attack transaction.  If we solve this quadratic hashing bug, this will enable us to safely have a much larger blocksize limit and increase the transaction capacity of the network.
* There are also other benefits of SegWit including making hardware wallets easier to manage, making future upgrades easier and more effective management of the database of unspent transactions.

@_date: 2017-01-25 06:23:26


This is not correct.  SegWit is both an effective and a literal increase in the actual blocksize.  i.e. the amount of data per block will actually increase to over 2MB. 
Of course, old non-upgraded nodes only see up to 1MB of data in their blocks, since some signatures wont be included.  However, there is nothing anyone can do about that.  Even after a hardfork, old nodes will still have the 1MB limit.
@_date: 2017-01-21 07:22:10


I am not sure why 95% is required more for softforks than any other kind of change to the consensus rules.  A hardfork requires even more consensus than a softfork

Satoshi put in the 1MB limit.  Core put forward a proposal (SegWit) to increase it to 2MB AND improve efficiency so its safe for further increases.  
However, Core do not control the blocksize, therefore accepting the proposal is up to the community, not Core

Well firstly I would say assigning no value to B2X coins, if it has value, may be irrational.
Secondly, there is this narrative, which I think you are getting at, which says something like this:


I think this narrative is false.
1. If B2X occurs, which coin has the higher market price may be considered important.  If you want to support Core, actually, ironically, you may need to download the B2X client and prudently sell those coins in the market
2. Custodians, who who hold coins on behalf of others, have an obligation to protect both tokens
3. B2X coin cause massive problems for light wallets, which essentially are exposed to wipeout in both directions.  For example what if a mobile client spends BTC, then B2X takes the proof of work lead?  The coins could appear back in the wallet again. Would be a total mess
So sure, if you are an extreme cypherpunk in your mums basement, running Core and only care about the ultra long term, then maybe you do not need to worry about the chaos B2X causes.  If you are a reasonable person, I think B2X is a concern and something worth fighting against
@_date: 2016-06-28 03:30:52


No it won't.  We can wait it out a while, then the "large blocks at any cost except widespread consensus" crowd will stop their attacks and stop the confrontation.  They will get bored, give up or leave the project.  At that point we can do a non controversial HF.  In the meantime the Core team will deliver an order of magnitude capacity improvement, with Segwit, Schnorr and aggregated signatures.
The Core team will also continue to deliver softfork after softfork without significant  contention and 95% miner thresholds, that you claim are impossible.
@_date: 2016-06-10 06:05:24
But BIP109 is incompatible with segwit, in the sense that segwit has new limit rules, therefore BIP109 will not increase the limit once SegWit activates.

There will be two data structures.  One with a 1MB limit and another with a 3MB limit.
@_date: 2017-01-28 05:21:32


Once 50% are signalling 2MB, then a malicious miner can find a single block and split the hashrate 50:50 into two separate chains.
Then if the larger blocksize chain wins and ADs are triggered, for 24 hours, the 50% signalling for 2MB have a 2MB limit and the 50% who were signalling 1MB have no limit at all.  The miners can then split 50:50 again, this time in a way exactly opposite to miner preferences.  This is likely to be very messy and confusing.
     
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:55:55


That would be a hardfork.  I'm theory a hardfork can steal any funds


Well you could get pre consensus for a hardfork  to avoid an altcoin or you could do it without pre consensus and have two coins.  The same is kind of true for a softfork.  **As far as I can tell it makes no sense to claim you don't need pre consensus for a hardfork but you do for a softfork.**
The difference is that for a softfork you can avoid an altcoin with over 50% of miners and that the status quo clients can be on your side.
 
@_date: 2017-01-30 16:05:33


Yes.  Miner signalling is great.  Add a flag supporting any proposal you like


Doesn't stop miners adding a BU flag to the block.  The problem is running BU or any incompatible version before consensus.  You can still flag anything.


No it is  not..

Unfortunately SegWit2x (B2X) is not really like Bitcoin Cash. SegWit2x (B2X) has a much weaker implementation compared to Bitcoin Cash (BCC).  Therefore it will be a lot harder to get free money and actually it could result in chaos.
This is because Bitcoin Cash (BCC) had a number of vital protections, like 2 way replay protection enabling smooth trading between the coins.  Unlike Bitcoin Cash (BCC), SegWit2x (B2X) is a hostile move, that does not help people trade the coins and instead we could get a total mess.  Selling the B2X coins may be extremely difficult.
For example, with SegWit2x (B2X):
* If you send a SegWit2x (B2X) transaction, this is automatically broadcast to the Bitcoin (BTC) network
* If you send a Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, this is automatically broadcast to the SegWit2x (B2X) network
* If you send a SegWit2x (B2X) transaction, this is automatically valid on Bitcoin (BTC)
* If you send a Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, this is automatically valid on SegWit2x (B2X)
* Light wallets (e.g. the wallet on your mobile) could jump between following Bitcoin (BTC) and SegWit2x (B2X)
* Your light wallet could follow SegWit2x (B2X), with your transactions having occurred on Bitcoin (BTC)
* Your light wallet could follow Bitcoin (BTC), with your transactions having occurred on SegWit2x (B2X)
This is why SegWit2x (B2X) is hostile and irresponsible.  I would urge all responsible actors in the community to oppose SegWit2x (B2X) which is very dangerous, and instead support safe proposals like Bitcoin Cash (BCC)
Also Bitcoin Cash has some technical advantages over SegWit2x (B2X).  Bitcoin Cash fixes the quadratic hashing bug, while SegWit2x leavs this bug unfixed and actually expands the space available for these attack transactions to 2MB.

Yes.  BCash is far superior to SegWit2x in many ways.  Firstly BCash includes the same BIP143 hashing digest as SegWit, which solves the quadratic scaling of sighash operations problem, so BCash has no disadvantage here (apart from maybe freezing pre-signed funds, which is a bit of a problem).
But lets look at where BCash is better than SegWit2x
* BCash has strong 2-way replay protection that exchanges demanded, SegWit2x has none.  Therefore exchanges wont be able to support S2X and many users could lose S2X coins
* BCash changed the difficulty, such that block headers are invalid according to Bitcoin.  This means all wallets must upgrade to follow the Bcash chain.  This is a good thing, as why should a wallet follow a chain where their transactions are invalid?  That would just cause chaos and confusion.
* BCash didn't have a new P2P network, so it is difficult to find peers and there is a lot of wasted traffic.  However the BCash lead dev plans to build this soon. In contrast the S2X coin lead dev, Jeff Garzik doesn't want to build a new P2P network and instead expects the two networks to perfectly split at the time of the hardfork.  Why is that necessary?  Why not build a P2P network beforehand?
* BCash has twice the onchain capacity of SegWit2x
* BCash has a passionate grass roots user movement who supports it (Just like Bitcoin).  This passionate grass roots support is key.  S2X coin has not such grass roots support.
On the other hand, SegWit2x has the malleability fix, but BCash may fix that soon enough, maybe before November anyway.  I support Bcash, but strongly oppose S2X coin.  Without replay protection S2X could result in complete chaos and damage the reputation of the ecosystem.
Why do you refuse to respond to me?  Why do you continue to support S2X despite the massive unnecessary technical flaws?
**Please support free markets and freedom of choice.  Users should be free to buy and sell Bitcoin, BCash or S2X coin, or any coin they wish.  Users will not be able to exercise this freedom if S2X is done is such a poor way without replay protection.**
Please can you at least think about the consequences of the lack of replay protection a bit more before continuing your support for S2X?

What is controversial?  The apparently controversial onchain capacity increase and fixes to malleability and quadratic hashing are inherently linked and cannot easily be separated 
 
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:17:03


And an incompatible change to the block header.  Otherwise mobile wallets could have their transaction occur on one chain while showing another chain to the user.  That would make them unusable.
The hardfork should contain both strong 2 way replay protection and a modification to the block header to be considered non hostile.
A new P2P network and address format are also probably a good idea, but not absolutely necessary to be considered non hostile, in my view.

However,  maybe this is a kind of grey area to your idea.  As global consensus on time is pretty strong and if a block has a timestamp of 2 hours and 1 minute in the future, then we can wait a minute and the block will be valid. (I think)
     
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:00:27
I am not sure what you are basing this 50% figure on, but almost everyone in the community wants larger blocks (probably over 95%).  I would expect  pools to share this view.  
In December 2015 c65% of miners backed BIP100, this was not only larger blocks but a dynamic market driven blocksize limit.
@_date: 2017-01-31 03:57:26
I think everyone is happy for friendly compromise.  The trouble is when one group of people try to achieve compromise by making threats, people do not want to compromise when there are threats or that damages the long term integrity of the currency.  Eventually if Bitcoin becomes big, all kinds of powerful entities may make threats to try and get their way.  Bitcoin must be resilient against that to have significant value.

Segwit literally increases the blocksize.  It does not compress anything
There is a new larger block, with both signatures and inputs, outputs. New nodes include all of this in there larger blocks.
Old nodes do not include some signatures in their blocks.  But old nodes enforce the 1MB limit.  There is nothing one can do about that.  A hardfork does not change that either.
A majority of nodes have already upgraded to accept the new literally and actually larger SegWit blocks

Erik, either we implement the best technology based on technical considerations.  Or we also consider politics and how people hate various people when making these decisions, and therefore make compromises.  If it is the 2nd thing, then many of us here are not interested in investing in that coin.  If you want to invest in it, please go ahead.  Please stop implementing that coin in a dangerous way that will cause damage for both sides.
Since Bitcoin Cash uses BIP143 ( by Core developers, which fixes several bugs.  Where do you stand on that?  Why does that not make Bitcoin Cash a compromise, since it implements a lot of SegWit and has many of the benefits of SegWit?  Why dont you push that as a compromise then?  In my view Bitcoin Cash has a better balance between transaction throughput and the quadratic hashing problem, than the poorly conceived SegWit2x idea. What advantages does Segwit2x have over Bitcoin Cash?

An empty block keeps the difficulty higher so reduces capacity.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:58:40


Yes, I guess you can do that.
For example:
* Send the coins to an address where the public key is not on the curve, so its unspendable on Bitcoin
* Add an OP_return, which is a public key on the new hadfork chain, with a new signature scheme
Counterparty's proof of burn is similar to this

Why do a hardfork just for the sake of it?  A hardfork should be used as a tool to achieve an objective, rather than being the objective itself.
Why was this argument not made for the other c4 softforks in the last 18 months?

Ok we will sort fork first then discuss the hard fork, which btw I support.  Please note this hardfork is better than Bitcoin in 2010, since there will be no rollback, we will just take the money back into your account directly without a rollback.

Well the evidence suggests you are wrong.  What makes Bitcoin great is users are sovereign and can use whatever coin they wish.  If there is a passionate and determined community, they can keep their coin alive


No, no it was not.  Core have been encouraging the large block fanatics to fork away to their own coin for years, as far as I know.
A dangerous split, like XT/Classic/BU/SegWit2x, those should be avoided at all costs.  These proposals had technical details which made them unnecessarily dangerous.  I have been trying to explain this again and again, for years
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:44:15


This attack assumed a malicious miner.  The malicious miner just needs to find one block once.  This can be done daily with just 0.7% of the hashrate.  Then the rest of the miners are split 50/50 on two chains.


Ok sure.  In that case BU' s signalling mechanism is not used.  When identifying flaws in BU, I act under the assumption BU is used.  Of course if BU is not used, no such flaw exists, but what kind of defence is that?


Yes miners CAN do that today.  I am merely suggesting miners SHOULDN'T.   Your defence that merely because something can happen, it should, is illogical and can be used to support anything, no matter how broken it is.

Right...  But it would be grest if industry was aware of this and blamed these empty blocks for the high fees, rather than blaming developers...

I could not agree more.  I wish them the very best of luck and success.  I hope what this demonstrates is that for a coin to survive and thrive, the most important thing is not having the largest miners, the elite developers or largest businesses on your side, its having a passionate and determined grass roots user base.
I think and hope BCash has such a grass roots user base, just like Bitcoin.  I hope both coins can do well.  I hope this puts an end to the aggressive plans (XT/BU/Classic/SegWit2x) of hoping to get business, developer or mining elites together to take over the Bitcoin name and stop the legacy Bitcoin moving forwards.
Bitcoin and BCash may have users that want them, let them keep their coins and thrive their own way.

It is a direct increase in the blocksize limit...
In what sense is it "indirect"
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:36:56


It added some elements of SegWit, such as BIP143, which I explained.  I think this is one of the key parts of SegWit


Indeed, it is possible segwit2x improves, but as it stands, it is hostile


No, your figures are wrong.
* Bitcoin Cash:  8MB blocks
* SegWit2x: 4MB blocks (8MB max)
* Bitcoin: 2MB blocks (4MB max)


Yes, that was done in a poor way, I agree.  But the principal of an invalid block header applies

Demand for Bitcoin is growing a lot right now and therefore transaction volume is increasing.  This is pushing up transaction fees and causing problems for some users.
Luckily, after a lot of hard work, the development team realised a proposal to double the transaction capacity of the system as well as other efficiency improvments.  This should therefore reduce fees by 50%.  This proposal is called SegWit and also makes future capacity improvments safer.
However the proposal is a change to Bitcoin's rules and requires consensus across the community to activate.  Currently c61% of Bitcoin wallets have upgraded.  However unfortunately Bitcoin miners are not supporting this capacity increase, for what appears to be political reasons and a misinformation campaign against SegWit instigated by enemies of Bitcoin.  Unfortunately if this pathetic  political standoff continues, transaction fees may keep increasing, making the user experience worse.
 
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:48:36
Segregated witness is a new major upgrade to the system.  The upgrade is a new way of spending Bitcoin, such that the signature that which signs the transaction is treated in a different way.  This has a number of benefits, including:
* **Large c110% onchain capacity increase (From a user perspective this occurs almost instantly)** - Bitcoin is becoming more popular and therefore fees to use the system are increasing.  This is a major concern to some users.  SegWit implements a large capacity increase of around c110%, it does this by increasing the amount of data in each block from c1MB to around 2.1MB.  This should lower the fees one needs to spend to use Bitcoin by a considerable amount.  The great thing about this is SegWit is a backward compatible change, therefore the capacity increase can occur very quickly.  As soon as a user upgrades, they get the benefits of more capacity without needing to wait for other users to upgrade.
* **Malleability fix** - When you send a transaction, it is possible for a malicious third party to modify it a bit, before it is included in the blockchain.  This can be a massive pain for users and this bug has caused huge problems in the past (See   For example if I receive bitcoin and I want to forward it on right away, its possible for someone to change the original transaction which would break my transaction that forwards it on.  This makes Bitcoin slower and harder to use.  SegWit fixes malleability.
* **Linear scaling of sighash operations** - As a transaction gets larger and larger, the time taken to verify the transaction rapidly increases, in a quadratic way.  For example, you could say doubling the size of the transaction increases verification time by 2 squared = 4 times.  This could be a problem as somebody could make a really big attack transaction, that would take so long to verify, many Bitcoin nodes could crash and be stuck.  There is currently a 1MB blocksize limit in Bitcoin, many people like me are worried about increasing this as otherwise somebody could make an even bigger attack transaction.  If we solve this quadratic hashing bug, this will enable us to safely have a much larger blocksize limit and increase the transaction capacity of the network.
* There are also other benefits of SegWit including making hardware wallets easier to manage, making future upgrades easier and more effective management of the database of unspent transactions.
Please see the following for more information:

What.  Why?
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:26:10


It is not only the absolute value that matters.  What may be more important is the value relative to the value of the system being secured 
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:09:45
Thanks.  In my view, the key point is that if only one user upgrades to SegWit then that one user gets the benefits of c100% more scale (lower fees) almost immediately, regardless of what other users do.
I think many do not understand this and incorrectly think users need to wait for a significant proportion of users to upgrade, to get the  scale benefits of SegWit.  This apparent delay is often mentioned as a reason not to support SegWit 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:38:38
Don't forget the large c110% onchain capacity increase with SegWit.  It is also important to note that an individual user who upgrades to SegWit gets the benefit of the capacity increase and c50% lower fees almost **instantly**, rather than needing to wait for others to upgrade.  In contrast, with a  hardfork one needs to wait for everyone to upgrade, or there will be two seperate coins.
@_date: 2017-01-26 07:24:02


Don't forget the other reason to sell coins on the forked chain. Which is that if its BU it has no checkpoint, so if the forked chain loses the lead, it will cease to exist.

Eric, SegWit2x is hostile.  
SegWit2x could do the hardfork in a responsible way, with replay protection like Bitcoin Cash.  After having this explained to them, and why not adding replay protection will cause chaos for both sides, SegWit2x continues with its plan.
SegWit2x is basically saying that if anyone wants to carry on using the original rules chain, then that will cause chaos for both sides.  It is kind of like a threat.  I am sorry, but that is a hostile attack and we must defend the system against this.
Why don't you support free markets, user freedoms and the ability to trade the coins against each other, to "let the market decide"?
* Bitcoin Cash had c5% miner support when it activated, and it survived and people freedom were respected.
* Ethereum Classic had no developer support and 5% of the hashrate when it launched, yet that coin continued
Please stop being hostile and respect people like me who want to use the original rules chain.  You can use B2X if you want to, but stop structuring it in an aggressive way that doesn't protect my rights.

@_date: 2017-08-22 15:48:13
I agree with you.
The issue is that many people have made very stupid and dangerous hardfork proposals.  For example, stupidly large blocksize limit increases (increases to 8GB blocks, locked in, in XT), totally broken protocols (BU, easily broken with the median EB attack), proposals not including 2 way replay protection, proposals not including wipeout protection, proposals not ensuring popular mobile wallets follow the same chain as their transactions, proposals not bothering to make a new p2p network, proposals not mitigating long signature verification time problems, hardfork  proposals with rushed schedules,  proposals not ensuring widespread consensus from the community ect ect...  Unfortunately these are complex issues and it's difficult for businesses to understand and evaluate them at this point.  
Therefore, maybe a good thing to do is for businesses to temporarily delegate responsibility for assessing these kinds of difficult issues to Core, for now, as they may simply not have the resources to understand them.  With the caveat that we as a community need to get in quick and stop this if Core does something stupid or dangerous.
In the future we can improve education and lock down the base protocol more, so businesses don't put out statements like this, supporting a particular development team.      
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:05:30


No, nothing wrong with that method at all.  The bad thing about BIP148 is the other chain could be wiped out.  That is different from merely choosing to use another chain.


No, BIP149 is different.  BIP149 it opt in for miners, they do not need to do anything.


I think most were bluffing.  Could be wrong though.
I'm not saying bluffing is any more justified than not bluffing.  Actually bluffing is probably even worse.  But, nevertheless, the bluff worked.


Well I said 5% to 10%.  Then you give a 0.3% example.  Not sure why...


Err, not sure I agree with that.  Also I do not think the whitepaper talks about this either.


Sorry, I do not follow.  Not sure why or how non-UASF miners could do that.  Please explain the scenario?  I think that is unlikely to be an issue, as users would probably make sure funds were in a  different output on both chains before using SegWit.  Also, this concept is very different from the wipeout issue.


Why is that asymmetric?  Im not sure miners stealing user funds is likely to be helpful.


Well it is kind of relevant, if the economy wasn't running SegWit clients, doing BIP148 would have achieved nothing.


Well it only worked once.  The old BIP148 like method worked 5 times in the past (using compulsory flags).  I prefer the new BIP9 method.  However going forward, there will likely be a new UASF method opt in for miners like BIP149.  That seems like it may be the best of both.  I guess miner flags wont work any more, due to ridiculous levels of false flagging.


Well the UASF did win...


??  The miners ran BIP148 compatible code...

It is true that Segwit2x has SegWit, but Bitcoin Cash has a lot of the benefits of SegWit and more capacity.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:16:28


Like what?  I have never seen anyone name these things.  I only see false things mentioned.


SegWit is optional anyway. If you don't want to segregate the witness in your transactions, don't.
But if people are really unhappy with 2MB and just want SegWit instead, maybe that will happen down the road

What do you mean purpose?  Purpose can be an abstract concept.  Who cares about the purpose?  SegWit actually does increase the blocksize whether its the purpose or not.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:54:10
why can't markets have the freedom to decide which is the true bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:51:56


Bcoin, BTCD and Libbotcoin are independent  alternative clients.  Satoshi didn't want these, but nobody is hostile to these clients.
BU is a deliberately  incompatible client, that results in a new competing coin.  That is a different thing.  There are already many competing coins and if they want to be another one, fine.  However BU needs to mitigate the risks like add a flag day checkpoint and add reply attack protection, otherwise many see BU as a hostile and potentially destructive client
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:26:19


Hashing only decides between competing compatible blocks, not incompatible ones like SegWit2x
@_date: 2017-01-16 03:20:49


Do you think there is much appetite to deploy SegWit like that?
Perhaps it could be done like this:
* First 12 months - 95% miner signalling threshold
* Next 6 months - 75% miner signalling threshold
* Next 6 months - 50% miner signalling threshold
* Next 6 months - 25% miner signalling threshold
* After the 30 month period - Activation without any threshold
That way the community will know it will get the effective c2MB blocks some people want, in at least 30 months time, whatever the miners do.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:59:09


It also makes it safer to implement onchain solutions like a hardfork to increase the blocksize.  Why would we want to do a hardfork and increase the blocksize for buggy malleable transactions, when SegWit makes these old buggy transactions almost redundant for new payments?
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:30:00


That is not true.  Of course you can implement all kinds of things.  It is only a tiny subcategory of changes, a hardfork, which if done without widespread consensus or basic safety mechanisms is a hostile attack.  This has nothing to do with Bitcoin Core, if Core released a hardfork version without widespread community consensus and without basic safety mechanisms, that would also be a hostile attack.  I would then advise people not to run that version of Core.  It’s a free society and I am entitled to advise people not to run software.


Nonsense.  The moderation policy says you cannot campaign for people to run an incompatible client, before consensus.  You can still ask for a hardfork or campaign for a hardfork with consensus.


No not at all


I would say any significant development team can veto a hardfork.  If everyone is running BTCD and not many people are running Core, then Core devs cannot veto a hardfork.  Yes, then the BTCD devs would have veto power, but if the community did not like that, they could run another compatible client.


They cannot make protocol decisions.  How many times do I need to repeat this, they can only prevent a hardfork…
And to repeat again, if you do not agree with there veto, run another compatible client.


There was not widespread community support.  I think we can get to that point fairly quickly now, we just need a cessation of hostilities and then we can get to work on hardfork.  I will oppose a hardfork in this hostile environment.


So because we didn’t do it in 2012 you don’t want to do it now?  I do not get that…
Also I think we need to hit the blocksize limit and have full blocks.  Full blocks are inevitable once Bitcoin becomes popular whatever the blocksize limit.  Corporates/voting systems/spammers ect ect will just flood the blockchain to make it full


I do not agree he carries more weight


Well they don’t force people to upgrade their nodes.  I will not upgrade to a hardfork in this hostile way


Satoshi never said it was temporary….


The whitepaper said “incentives can transition entirely to transaction fees” and Satoshi talked about “outbidding other users".  I never said lower transaction volume is a good thing.  I want transaction volume to grow.  I feel you try to misrepresent almost everything I say. 


I agree.  I also want cheaper transactions.  That is why I support the c110% capacity increase in SegWit. 
Satoshi also talked about an alternative non “official” implementation being a “menace to the network” and the protocol rules being “set in stone”.   I don't see the hardfork to larger blocks in an unnecessarily dangerous way, despite the existence of safer ways group, talk about these quotes much...
Although of course what Satoshi said is irrelevant anyway, since this is a science and not a religion.


I do not agree they are different as one can do both at the same time (for example 95% miner threshold and then 12 months after the threshold is met the fork activates with a binding checkpoint block).  But I am not sure what you mean here anyway and BU does not do either of these things.


Sorry, I do not follow.

Even if the price did double every 4 years, this would still be a weak model.    I think the value of mining rewards **relative** to the value of the system is also important.  Price increases do not help with that

He is talking nonsense.  With a hardfork in Bitcoin you can do anything,  you do not need to rollback.

Why is this a character assassination?  I think he said great things, that taught me a lot.  When I read his posts I was learning this for the first time.  I am reminiscing in a positive way.

Well kind of.  That is true with respect to BCash.  But BCash was much safer and better proposal than Segwit2x (S2X).  BCash has strong 2 way replay protection while SegWit2x has none. This means that if you transact on Bitcoin, your S2X coins could also be spent, and vice versa.  This may result in many people losing a lot of money and becoming confused.

Not true.  I have made posts praising some of the positive BCash features:

3. Large capacity increase
4. Strong fanatical grass roots user support, who believe in the vision

The naming is part of a secret conspiracy by AXA and the Bilderberg Group, since the name is really vital.  First it was called BCash and now the plan is to switch to Bitcoin Cash.  Before later on, when the endgame is to switch it to BBCash, in a final move to make it really go wild.

This is on-chain scaling...
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:42:56
Well not all those manipulating things and spreading lies work for BU.  This blocksize issue has created a gap for enemies of Bitcoin and trolls to fit in
@_date: 2017-01-17 01:33:43


Yes, I think that is correct.  However, the time-stamp of each block matters as it must move forwards in time, (I think each block must have a time-stamp after the median of the last 12 or something).
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:16:15
I don't know...
Simple as that
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:56:17


I think it includes misinformation and leaves out important parts of the story
For example:


Gavin supported BitcoinXT, a proposal to lock in increases in the limit to 8GB!!  Yes thats right, 8,000MB!!  Had this proposal been implemented the current limit would be 32MB.  At the same time, the proposal had nothing to mitigate various attack vectors associated with larger blocks, such as the quadratic hashing bug.  Had it been adopted, Bitcoin could have failed by now if people exploited the quadratic hashing bug.


That cannot possibly be true.  Many people who oppose reckless blocksize limit increases and support calm safe increases, do not work for Blockstream


This fails to mention that these costs, such as electricity, might or might not benefit from economies of scale.  In contrast, higher block propagation times DIRECTLY benefits larger miners, who benefit by being able to propagate to themselves faster.
Lets say you have one large mining farm, that has a 30% global hashrate share, in one location, you only need to propagate to the remaining 70% of the hashrate.  While a 1% miner needs to propagate to the 99%.  This gives the large miner a direct advantage.  Cheaper electricity costs might (on the other hand it might not be for example smaller miners may have relatively cheaper cooling costs) also be an advantage, but this may be less directly linked to being larger.
Economies of scale directly linked to Bitcoin could have fundamentally different security characteristics to economies of scale unrelated to Bitcoin, like cheaper electricity costs.


I do not think it is fair to say that one company opposed XT, many opposed these dangerous hardforks.
Let me just try to remind you again how dangerous BitcoinXT/Bitcoin Classic were:
* BitcoinXT/Bitcoin Classic had no wipe-out protection - So if the new coin lost the PoW lead, the coins in it could vanish from user wallets.  Users would then lose funds.
* BitcoinXT/Bitcoin Classic had no replay protection - So if users sent a transaction, they could be replayed on the other chain, such that users lost funds
If these points were not important, why does Bitcoin Cash now have replay protection?  Why does SegWit2x now have wipeout protection?  It would be great is these people showed a little humility and now accept that these are necessary safety features for hardforks and stop blaming people for deciding to reject hardforks without these crucial safety features.
All I did was oppose XT/Classic and try to explain the flaws of these proposals.  That is well within my rights and not at all unethical.  I have no conflict of interest.  I merely want the blocksize limit increase to be done in a safe way.
* BitcoinXT/Bitcoin Classic had no modification to the block header - This could mean light wallets jump around between following the new and old chain, it could mean light wallets follow a chain where there transactions are invalid, it would just be a confusing mess


No, it is not true that the hardfork "only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network".  XT and Classic had a 75% miner threshold.  
Even worse, it activated when EXACTLY 75% of the miners supported it.  It was impossible for more than 75% of miners to support at the time of activation, because it was rolling miner voting rather than a voting window.  This locked in a 25% vs 75% split, rather than even allowing the possibility more than 75% of the miners upgrading.  This was repeatedly pointed out at the time, again and again.  But Gavin refused to listen.
Remember the 75% did not have any wipe-out protection.  The condition with each chain having a 50% chance of being in the lead is 69% vs 31% (When the 31% has the asymmetric advantage).
Therefore rather than only being activated "if it was supported by a significant majority of the network", the parameters were such that it was almost optimally the worst possible most uncertain situation.  75% vs 25% compared to the optimally worst situation of 69% vs 31%.  But add in some false flagging, which we now know is very prevalent, and this 75% vs 25% looks even weaker.


I think only promotion of the software was banned, not discussion of it.  I remember being flooded with countless posts promoting XT, despite the lack of consensus.  All my comments pointing out the flaws with XT were down-voted.  The moderators had a difficult decision, but they had to take action to defend Bitcoin and stop all the spam and allow serious discussion
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:39:01
I do not think its an attack on Bitcoin.  At worst BCash is an attack on new BCash investors
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:37:38


There are well funded people aggressively pushing for hardforks and having detailed  discussions with miners.  The campaign may be gathering some momentum as well support from significant sections of the Bitcoin community. This represents a significant risk.
Banning the promotion of incompatible clients on certain forums may not be proving to be an effective or productive way of protecting the network.  Actually the moderation policy on this forum may be unfortunately having a counterproductive impact on the health of the network.
Unfortunately I think we need to put more effort into analysing and criticizing some of the prominent hardfork proposals, to point out the potential flaws.  This may help ensure people don't run these clients.
 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:52:44
But the new S2X token will need a new p2p network anyway.  It's sensible to build one before the fork, not hope it spontaneously comes into existence in one instant when the fork occurs.
@_date: 2017-01-28 05:17:53


The BU logic appears to be that because one can run broken  software, therefore everyone might as well run broken software anyway.
 
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:55:53


I was making these same points when BCH was trading at a 7% price.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:11:10
Well if Core did that, it would be a hardfork, creating another new coin.  It might also be pretty pointless, as I doubt many people would use that coin
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:17:56


Well if there is a hardfork and there is not sufficient consensus, two things may happen, depending on how its structured:
* 1 - The hardfork could fail, 
* 2 - There could be a destructive chainfork, with two prevailing currencies, causing mass confusion, replay attacks, new liabilities for exchanges, uncertainty and loss of integrity in the system
BU, XT and Classic seem to be structured in a way like option 1, they ensure that if they lose the lead, the coins vanish.  Therefore they are very likely to fail if there is insufficient consensus.  I can go into more details, but the main reason they are likely to fail is that they give a very compelling opportunity to speculators to drive up the price of the original chain, wipe out the new chain and make profits.  This process will damage the reputation and integrity of the system as funds will be lost and therefore we should try to avoid going down this path.
Option two is how Ethereum did their contentious hardfork, such that the original chain does not wipe out the new chain if it takes the lead.  If there is appropriate mitigation of the risks this may be ok with slightly less consensus, once the campaigning for option 1 hardforks become insignificant we may be able to work calmly as community together on this option.  However if consensus is too weak, then we may have the mutually assured destruction game theory at play, as confusion damages the integrity of the system and both sides lose.  This is likely to be worse than Etheruem as Bitcoin is more a money than a smart contract tool.
However, ironically, once all the attacks and animosity are reduced, we can probably do the hardfork with consensus easily, without worrying too much about the above.
These above dynamics explain why consensus is required for the elimination of a protocol rule.  Many people in the community identified these dynamics or a subset of them and concluded these made the rules highly resilient, such that a minority is able to veto the removal of a rule.  This is why many became interested in Bitcoin.  This is a very interesting characteristic for money, as its unlike the USD for example, where a majority or small group can impose rule changes on the system a minority may be unhappy with.  In Bitcoin this may not be possible for a group or even majority to impose these changes on an unhappy minority.  This means the unit is robust and stable and therefore potentially a good store of value. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:26:59


Right... And in the mean time ordinary users and exchanges suffer huge collateral damage.  Some of that damage will prevent the market from effectively deciding.
Putting the ecosystem through that, unnecessarily, should be considered hostile.
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:54:14


Sorry I do not follow.  The new transaction type fixes malleability and also has its witness segregated.


I think you misunderstood.  Miners can ignore the suggested "75% discount" when selecting transactions, they still need to comply with the network rules on block validity


It creates two buckets so does require this
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:19:21
The main chain is what you want it to be, regardless of the amount of hashrate, 90% or otherwise.  Actually, if anything, investors and traders as a group may be more important than the amount of hashrate.  Ironically a lower hashrate chain may have inferior market liquidity, due to slower blocks, helping support the price.
Personally, I think the only way to have a long term robust system is that if there is any significant contention, the community should always regard the chain following the original rules rather than the new rules (where possible) as the main chain, regardless of hashrate.  That is certainly how I will act.  If the community does not do that then the rules may be too flimsy, such that eventually money could be stolen or created out of knowhere.  That governance system may not be perfect, and some people hate it, but I think its kind of the least worst viable option.
As for the SegWit2x hardfork proposal you mention, I think it is vital the community oppose it.  I think it is a very dangerous idea, it does not include basic and necessary safety features like replay protection, so it could result in mass loss of funds. BCash was a much better proposal.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:58:16
Sure.  Also using locktime may be a better idea.  Of course I personally can and would do that.
The point is most ordinary users won't 
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:11:52


Like this:
     4 * Base data + witness data  &lt; 1MB
Or like this:
     Base data + witness data &lt; 1MB
     
Do you think we could have a 2 year window, when at the end, SegWit activates regardless of the level of miner support? Or is that too risky?


Ok, you make a good point here
@_date: 2017-01-28 09:45:50
If miners won't do that, why put it in BU code then?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:19:08


Its only up to the market to decide if replay protection is enabled to ensure smooth trading
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:19:12
The Core developers  have just released a proposal to more than double the blocksize limit.  It is now up to the community to decide if they want the increase or  not
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:52:27


I agree.  That is not the issue though.  I do not think anyone has a problem with a  "safe split", the issue is the SegWit2x hardfork is implemented in a particularly dangerous way, that is likley to cause chaos across the ecosystem, such that we all lose.
It the following safety mechanisms are added, I have no problem with the hardfork:
* Strong 2 way replay protection, ensuring the same transactions are not valid on both chains (like Bitcoin Cash did)
* A change to the block header, such that mobile wallets follow the same chain their transactions occur on
* New P2P network, so it doesn't cause clients constantly banning each other
* Wipeout protection (finally included in B2X (not included in BU, XT and Bitcoin Classic))
* Address format change (maybe not completely necessary, in my view)
There seems to be this misunderstanding that people are unhappy with others forking off.  That is not the case.  I just kindly ask that hardforks are not done in such a dangerous and hostile way.  As it stands, SegWit2x should be classified as a hostile attack on the Bitcoin ecosystem.
As for which coin is "called" Bitcoin, I do not care, I will call whatever one I like Bitcoin and so can you. Maybe if we make sure the hardfork is done safely, people can freely buy and sell the coins and the "market can decide"
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:52:03
But the lead dev of SegWit2x said, and I quote:


Source: 


If a minority want to use and invest in the legacy coin, why not let them?  Add replay protection, whether the new coin is called Bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2017-01-17 03:19:07
The target difficulty is the same for everyone.  We need consensus and agreement on block validity or the system breaks down.
Does this mean Bitcoin is not perfectly robust?
Yes!  Bitcoin is not perfect.
In my view, unfortunately, there is a lot of inappropriate complacency in the community.  People think Bitcoin has survived 8 years and therefore Bitcoin must be perfect and will survive even if we do stupid things like run clients that do not have consensus on the rules for block validity.  In my view we must remain cautious, prudent and vigilant.  We should not run clients that do not have the same rules for block validity.  (e.g. BU, where users are encouraged to set their own different rules  on block validity)
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:49:44
Please let me know when you have had time to think some of this stuff through
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:47:34
So as someone, who like the exchanges, insists on basic safety features for hardforks, like BCH's strong 2 way replay protection enabled by default, I strongly oppose Segwit2x.
This means I now have more allies in opposition to Segwit2x, the BCH supporters.  This is great news, perhaps we can defeat Segwit2x really quickly then, and finally get to work on a safe hardfork.   
Erik, please join me, the Bitcoin exchanges and the BCH supporters and demand strong 2 way replay protection.  Please think through the potentially disastrous consequences of Segwit2x without replay protection 
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:55:40


And before the difficulty fell, that coin was around.
I think Bitcoin investors are more patient than BCH holders
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:21:28
How will the super majority smoothly  sell their original rules coins to the minority, without replay protection?
If the super majority don't sell their original rules coins and buy Segwit2x coins, being in the super majority won't have much of an economic impact anyway.  
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:05:18


Well that would have had the asymmetric advantage, so the situation is a little different.
But this is why I opposed BIP148
But what is your point, a group of people did a bad thing, therefore another group of people should also do a bad thing?
@_date: 2016-11-22 04:31:03
Please try and respect those with a different view.  He is a great, smart and nice guy, he just had a different view on scaling and  how to do a hardfork.  We should be happy people have different views and respect those people, while at the same time rally behind the existing rules to prevent a potentially destructive hardfork.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:50:26
Erik, firstly, thanks for finally responding


Indeed, it requires users to opt in for the new coin.  That is what makes it ethical and non aggressive.  If users and businesses support the hardfork, they will upgrade.  People only worry about this, because they doubt if the hardfork really has strong support.
This is why a hardfork requires time, because we need to allow time for wallets to upgrade.
Also there are huge advantages to changing the transaction format.  We can fix the quadratic hashing bugs and malleability bugs ect ect.  This makes larger block sizes safer.  This is a good opportunity to do this.  Bitcoin Cash did it fine.


For the following reasons:
1. Because it is the ethical and responsible thing to do.  That will minimize the risk of loss to third parties
2. Remember its not just the "minority" who replay protection is for, the minority chain will still have value, protecting that value is in **everyones** interest, not just the minority who want to make a long term investment in the old coin.  If the super-majority support SegWit2x, this super-majorty will still rationally want to access there funds on the old chain (also replay is a 2 way problem, funds on the majority chain can still be replayed)
3. Because assuming the new chain has super-majority support without sufficient evidence is arrogant.  Be humble and modest, and kindly ask the community to upgrade.  Appreciate that some members of the community may not want to follow the hardfork, and respect their rights not to.  Don't you see how calling people so insignificant that they do not even matter is insulting?  Do you see why people regard this as an attack?
4. At this point it doesn't matter how much support the new hardfork chain has anyway, replay protection is now necessary.  There is an economic incentive to invest in the old coin as profits can be made.  There is also an economic incentive to attack exchanges to trying to exploit the lack of replay protection.  The cat is out of the bag now, financial speculators will want to speculate on the old coin, no matter how much support the hardfork has
**5. If the majority support SegWit2x, for SegWit2x to be the "winner", SegWit2x supporters will need to sell their legacy Bitcoin to ensure SegWit2x wins in the financial market.  If they do not do that, the old coin will have a higher price, its basic supply and demand.  They wont be able to do that smoothly without replay protection. If SegWit2x supporters cannot sell their coins, maybe Core supporters, even if that is a minority group, will have a larger market cap.  Actually fewer miners on the old chain, resulting in a slower initial block times, may reduce liquidity and make the market price higher.  We saw this dynamic occur with Bitcoin Cash, when ironically each new block sent the price down, not up.  Please think through all the dynamics at play here.  It is a lot more complex than you appear to think.  I tried to write up some of these counter intuitive factors here: 


Almost all the major exchanges have already come out against any incompatible implementation without replay protection.  They know replay protection is in their interest. I will provide the citations below in-case you have missed them.  When quoting levels of support for SegWit2x, please try to be balanced and acknowledge the high level of opposition from exchanges.
Besides, this is an economic/financial system.  It cannot be left to businesses and miners.  Eventually investors will have their say on the markets.  You can either make that process messy or clean.

I dont claim to represent consensus
The point of PoW is to determine the order of valid blocks.  This solves the double spending problem.  I think its naive to claim that PoW also determines the rules of the system.  PoW cant solve political problems, it only decides between competing valid blocks.
Indeed the very start of the whitepaper makes this pretty clear:


The PoW is there to solve the double spending problem, thats it.  No amount of PoW can spend money without a valid digital signature.

Please provide the context for this quote.  Jeff Garzik wrote a patch to increase the blocksize limit.  Satoshi told him no don't do it that way, or it will cause two coins.  
Satoshi said:


Satoshi then went on to provide an example over how to increase the blocksize limit in a safer way, with the 10 month grace period your quote mentions.
Satoshi then said:


That is all we are saying now.
To paraphrase Satoshi:


Instead lets increase  limit in a safer way, like Satoshi said. Firstly with Segwit, and after that, a hardfork with a long lead time like Satoshi suggested, plus other safety features which are now necessary as the network is much larger now.  (e.g. modification to the block header, new p2p network layer, strong 2 way replay protection, longer grace period than 10 months ect ect)
**Incidentally none of the hardfork proposals you supported (XT, Classic, BU and Segwit2x) even include the 10 month grace period Satoshi reccomended in your quote**
Source:                     
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:49:15


Why is it hostile to ask that any hardforks include basic safety features?  Who is that hostile to exactly?  The safety features are win win for both sides.
It is clearly hostile to promote a client like XT, Bitcoin Classic, BU and SegWit2x.  These clients lacked key features like wipeout protection, replay protection and an incompatible modification to the block header.  They would have caused mass loss of funds and been hugely destructive for Bitcoin. Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, which locked in 25% miner opposition at the time of activation and gave the original chain the asymmetric advantage, were particularly destructive ideas.  I could not design a worse idea if I tried, it was almost optimally the most terrible way to do a harfork. 
Why is opposing dangerous hardforks and supporting safe non aggressive hardforks, that let the market decide, like Bitcoin Cash, hostile?

@_date: 2017-01-05 11:40:41


Rusty, thanks for your comments.  Please could you explain the above in a bit more detail?
I was thinking that from a user perspective, as soon as an individual  upgrades to SegWit they get the full benefits of higher capacity almost instantly.  However, from a system wide level, then yes, we may need to wait for the ecosystem to upgrade to get the full macro capacity benefits of SegWit.
Is this correct and what do you think the better way to look  at this problem is?
  
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:45:32
So we shouldn't judge the software on merit but based on the characters of the people that wrote it?
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:06:59


The people who think like that are just confused. Core does not define the rules, Core is just a software project.  If you do not like Core, just run different compatible Bitcoin wallet software.
Neither Core nor another software project can change Bitcoin's consensus rules.  For example, if Core decided to do a rushed hardfork to 8MB blocks, in 3 months, without replay protection, I am sure the community would not run that client, and it would have no impact.  Core do not have special powers to either cause or prevent hardforks.
Please stop confusing the consensus rules of Bitcoin with one particular software client.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:30:48


Yes probably. I am not saying I think that is good, but it happened.


Maybe nothing if BIP148 was a bluff.  If it wasn't a bluff, I think it had enough support for the asymmetric advantage to carry it through and do the destructive wipeout and win.  Perhaps very quickly.
I think the asymmetric advantage can be really powerful, perhaps just 5% to 10% economic support is enough to win. This is a key vulnerability for Bitcoin. I have been a huge advocate of the power of the asymmetric advantage.  This is part of the reason I so strongly opposed XT/Classic and BU
However it is clear the majority of the community  supported SegWit, while at the same time nobody proposed a UASF defense. So I guess there was not much objection to this

@_date: 2017-01-27 19:34:24
In this article a new variant of the "median EB attack" is revealed.  An explanation of the median EB attack can be seen on the following link:
**New variant of the median EB attack**
* Step 1 - Launch the median EB attack.  Successfully find just one block and cause a 50/50 hashrate split, on two separate chains
* Step 2 - Hope the larger blocksize chain wins the battle, by triggering the AD values.  Then 50% of "sticky gates" open, while 50% remain closed
* Step 3 - The attacker now has 24 hours to make an even larger block, exploiting the fact that 50% of the sticky gates are open.  If so, the network is split 50/50 again.   (This is ironic since miners with a lower blocksize limit accept the larger block, and those with a higher limit reject it)
* Step 4 - Hope the larger blocksize chain wins again.  Now  all sticky gates are open. 
* Step 5 - After 24 hours since the first set of sticky gates opened, they close.  The hashrate can now be split 50/50 again.  This process can continue 
Please note, the above assumes all miners have the same AD value  set.  If miners have different AD values the underlying concept still holds.      
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:33:45
well around half of them I guess
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:35:50


This means that as the size of the transaction doubles, the number of hashing operations goes up 2^2 =4.  This is very bad scaling


Well you get SegWit before 2X coin launches


My best guess is that due to the poor implementation of B2X, the ecosystem will send out strong signals they reject it before it happens, such that miners chicken out and it gets no hashrate, but I have no idea.  B2X seems pretty pointless when we already have a larger blocksize with Bitcoin Cash


I think financial markets are probably more important than hashing power.  Hashing should follow markets
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:11:21
Firstly, thanks for not insulting me for giving my view and thanks for not questioning my motives.  I appreciate that.  Like many others I have been arguing the same points again and again for years, I feel like the other side does not listen (as I am sure they do with me) and it gets very frustrating.  If any of the frustration comes off in my comments, and they seem rude in any way, I apologies.


I really think that is highly unlikely.  This is one of the strangest blue sky risks.  What you are asking is what if demand for Bitcoin transactions is so high, ordinary people cannot afford to use it.  That would be a great problem to have and we would all be very rich.  It is a bit like saying, "what if the Fed wants to destroy Bitcoin, so they buy all the coins so that normal people do not hold them anymore?"  People have said that, my response is simply, "in your dreams!!".
Another reason this will not happen is everyone agrees with capacity increases.  Look at Core's roadmap for example:
* SegWit - c110% capacity increase
* Schnor signatures - c40% capacity increase
* Aggregated signatures - c100% capacity increase
* MAST
* Various hardfork proposals to increase the blocksize, to be pushed forward once the dangerous plans to campaign for incompatible clients without consensus end, as during the attempts, which Satoshi called a "menace to the network", we need to rally behind the existing rules for safety reasons.  The hardfork proposals include, BIP103, BIP105 or the 2MB non witness data hardfork the 5 Core devs who signed the HK agreement are working on.
The above all accumulate together to a massive capacity increase.  It is only the "large blocks at any cost, so long as its done dangerously" crowd misconception that anyone does not want massive capacity increases.  We just want capacity increases in a safe and prudent way.


I agree, but this is social momentum.  What can we do about that?  SegWit is a 110% capacity increase and people still complain.


No, I am sure developers would work on them.  But its not only about that, it is about miners, users and merchants adopting these technologies and altering their behavior, so its compatible with full blocks, which are inevitable if Bitcoin succeeds.  Demand for highly replicated immutable storage is unbounded.


The branding as spam is often due to specific evidence of malicious transactions, for example:
* Sudden pickup of transactions, often at the same feerate
* Many small outputs sent to outputs with publicly known private keys (So that anyone trying to pick up pennies contributes to the spam attack)
* Long chains of transactions


Nobody is saying that.  I would be perfectly happy with a large blocksize limit increase.  I am fine with the large SegWit increase and would be happy with 2x that as well.  The issue is how to hardfork in a safe way, nobody knows how to make it safe during a campaign to run an incompatible client without consensus.  Once the BU campaign stops a hardfork can be quite fast.  The confrontation from BU causes anger and stubbornness, these feelings make a long lasting chain-split after a hardfork more likely.  Therefore we need the aggression to end.  Core is working on a solution to this, the "Evil fork" idea.


Yes other altcoins should try to catch up on scalability.  However they have not done that as there is no demand for that, so they focus on other things.  Therefore the one technical area Bitcoin has a massive lead is scalability.  I think this is starting to change as some altcoins come under stress.


No I was not, but the lead here is large to.  I do not think "distributed node numbers" are that important.  What matters is the proportion or number of users who fully validate when they receive economic transactions into their wallet.  This is what needs to be protected.  I think "number of nodes" is a misconception.


That is why everyone agrees on the need to increase capacity.  However I have a long multi decade vision, I am not that concerned over the short term.  I think building a trusted, robust and sustainable platform for the future is important.
Luckily the capacity issues are being addresses at an incredible pace:
* Mass adoption of wallets with dynamic fees
* Opt in RBF released
* CPFP released
* Segwit, which includes linear scaling of sighash operations, malleability fixes and capacity increases
* Bitcoin 0.12 which sped up signature validation speeds by c7x
* Mempool limiting mode for nodes
* Blocks only mode for nodes
* Compact blocks/Xtreme thin
* Development of LN and payment channel technology
* Headers first
* Plus much much more
The people complaining are making out nothing is being done about the capacity problems.  The exact opposite is true, the developers have done a huge amount of work to improve the situation.  We should be thanking them, not blaming them.

In my view this is a strawman argument.  Everyone wants a capacity increase.  SegWit for example is a c110% on chain increase capacity increase.
In addition to this many also support a hardfork to increase capacity even further.  The only question is do we do the hardfork in a safe collaborative way, or a dangerous confrontational way, that may result in stubbornness and a catastrophic chain split.  At the moment it seems to be a choice between a dangerous  confrontational way, or a delay in the hopes the confrontation stops.  In my view it's a no brainer choice, let's wait for a safe hardfork

I am not sure I understand this. Why does it matter what the overall network transaction capacity of the network is? As soon as SegWit activates, anyone who wants to upgrade and get the full benefits of higher capacity for their own transactions, can do so, "overnight". Is this not what matters?
@_date: 2016-11-29 04:29:39
SegWit is likely to lower fees a lot more of it activates.  Therefore growth may take a while.
As for what the absolute level of fees should be, this is a difficult topic.  I think it would be good if there was eventually a market based dynamic system to determine   blockspace supply, like BIP100, within limits necessary for technical reasons 
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:09:35
err..  Maybe, probably a good idea.
Does this not put a ceiling on the price of the hardfork coin, at 100% of the value of the original coin.

The question you should ask is it better than the existing rules, if so, it is rationale to support the protocol change, so long as its done in a safe way.
For example I supported Bitcoin Classic, and the 2MB blocks, however I thought the upgrade would be done in an unsafe way, and therefore rejected Bitcoin Classic.

Campaigning or marketing for people to run an incompatible client, before there is consensus.  For example bribing people to run nodes (Classic Cloud), spamming with comments campaigning, threatening people  that a hardfork will occur in a dengerous way if they don't develop code for a hardfork, or forming a mass movement to encourage the hardfork to occur before consensus.


No, voicing opinions is fine.


This is FUD, discussion is not banned on &gt; The offer of support to developers of alternative clients?
Of course not...


No, only a subset of the bigger block cause is an attack.  I want bigger blocks but I am not attacking Bitcoin to try and get my way.  I respect the right of the minority to veto a hardfork

If they were buying.  Then it seems reasonable to me to leave the ATM as soon as they have a zero conf transaction incoming


Even with an empty mempool, it can still take several hours to get a confirmation.  A large mempool is not the cause of this problem.  Expecting to wait for a confirmation at an ATM is simply not appropriate, regardless if blocks are full or not.


If it great that the ecosystem tries to address these problems now, rather than in a few years time when the ecosystem could be even larger.


I agree, having larger capacity and bigger blocks right now is a great idea.  Luckily SegWit does both of these things.  SegWit offers a massive 100% capacity increase.  However, when it comes to a hardfork, in my view, the right collaborative climate does not exists in the community right now to do this safely.  If people have ideas over how to do it safely then that may help.
@_date: 2016-11-27 14:22:54


I appreciate that and I kind of agree with you.  However, in my view, one of the factors which prevents miners being able to do that, may be the community.  This seems to be one of the most important issues for them.


Sorry, its not targeted at you specifically.  If you took it that way, I apologies.  Many people are very angry about the moderation policy, when I mention a possible issue or flaw with BU, the BU supporters often respond by mentioning the moderation policy.

I agree they only scratch the surface

I support SegWit, however I highly doubt this is true.  The blocksize debate and scalability is only of interest to a small subsection of the Bitcoin community.
I doubt even 2% of participants in Bitcoin exchanges have a basic understanding of the existing transaction architecture, let alone the advantages of SegWit 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:30:07


No, the capacity increase also cones from segregating the witness 


The discount is just to ensure the fees are consistent with the new blocksize limit.  Miners are free to ignore that discount stuff.
The more space for witness data reflects the reduced burden on the network and encourages the use of these transactions.  At the same time it increases onchain capacity, which I thought people wanted

Please note Ethereum's HF plan was much smarter than the BU plan.  BU does not have a checkpoint like Ethereum did.  Therefore the BU chain could be totally wiped out if the existing chain overtakes it.  Remember, despite over 90% of miners first supporting the Ethereum HF, on two occasions the old coin reached c30% of the market cap of the new coin.  The BU chain could therefore be an unattractive investment, since if the old chain reaches 30% of the value, people could fear the "wipeout" and this may help exacerbate its self destruction.

Firstly there is nothing wrong or bad about alt clients.  Alt clients should be encouraged and competition between dev teams is a positive thing.  The issues is deliberately incompatible clients that would result in a chain split and new coin.  The repeated conflation of “alt clients” and incompatible clients by the “large blockers” has caused huge problems in the community.
As Satoshi said:




Source: 
And on a patch to increase the blocksize limit: 


Source:  
That is all the current developers are saying, “Don't use [BU/XT/Classic], it'll make you incompatible with the network”
Secondly, the frustration started in August 2015 when BitcoinXT was launched.  was flooded with posts promoting this incompatible client and encouraging people to run it, which would have caused a catastrophic failure of the system.  Since then there has been no restbite from these dangerous and counterproductive campaigns, as soon as they stop, we can safely do a hardfork.  Unless they continue for several years and willingness to do a hardfork dries up.


BitcoinXT is the cause.  That is when the frustration started.


I do not know.  I had thought it would end much sooner.  I am very frustrated as I feel I have no choice but to rally behind the existing rules to defend the system during these campaigns.  I find this frustrating as I support larger blocks.


What straightforward increase?  This is a misconception.  It is not as simple as changing one number, someone tried to do that in 2010 and Satoshi said no, its more complicated than that.  For example:
* It has to have a safe activation methodology
* We need to solve the coordination problem
* We need to address the attack block scenario, caused in part by the quadratic scaling of sighash operations
SegWit is one of the safest and most simple ways of getting a blocksize limit increase


What stifling?  Transaction costs are c8 cent.  That is not a problem.


I apologies on behalf of those people


Like what, 15 cent per transaction?  The fact is that getting everyone to validate, store and propagate transactions is expensive.  Lowering the fee doesn’t reduce the costs of doing this.


They have been employed by the moderators of private web forums, and these moderation policies have been publicly criticized by the developers.  What else do you want them to do?  In my view its unethical to hold people responsible for the actions of others.

@_date: 2016-11-19 22:45:54
Pretty much everyone is in favour of a moderate blocksize limit increase.  The problem is a coordination problem, which is for a hardfork the community all needs to upgrade together to the same new set of rules.  This is very difficult to do in a confrontational climate, for example when hardfork attempts like Classic or BU are occuring, which do not attempt to solve the coordination problem or mitigate any risks of a chain split.  This confrontational approach makes  it even more dangerous as it can create stubboness.  This means many people feel they need to rally behind the existing 1MB rule to protect the system, despite really wanting larger blocks. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:58:38
I see what you mean, by they need to be careful.  That could be misleading.  People could invest in coin XYZ thinking it a great $20m idea and only has a $1m market cap, when the actual price * total supply (including premine) is $100m.  I think they should therefore be cautious and try to overestimate the MCap, which is the most prudent way.
Your method could be used for ranking, not displaying a market capitalisation figure, in my view.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:31:40
SegWit is a permanent fix to quadratic scaling of sighash operations and malleability, this clears the way for further blocksize limit increases (Which can be done via a hardfork when the aggression and contention falls a bit, the current climate is too adverserial and vitriolic for a hardfork).  Why would we want to increase the block space available for transactions with quadratic scaling of sighash operations  when this has been fixed?
@_date: 2016-12-10 13:26:58


A softfork *could* do that, but in Bitcoin so far they have not.
 For example with the SegWit softfork:
* upgraded miners will build on blocks produced by old miners, so is not an attack on the old miners
* there is a 95% threshold, not 51%
* there will not even be a minority branch, unless miners upgrade to a new client designed  to create one
* The the new SegWit rule does not remove any meaningful functionality or functionality that was ever used, so I don't  see how that can be an attack        
Also a hardfork does that same 51% attack to some light clients.  Except with  hardfork it is worse, since miners can be building on both chains. With a softfork   all miners, old and new ones, are all working on extending the same chain.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:47:25

@_date: 2016-11-14 10:29:02


Perhaps, but again, while being fast and cheap is not unique, having large network effects is also not unique.  There is the USD and online payment networks that already have huge network effects.


Perhaps that actual user benefits from censorship resistance


Currently I only use Bitcoin because I like the technology.  I look at the system as if it is in the very early nascent stages, there is a small amount of use cases right now, but what is more important is building a solid technical framework for the future and building a robust and reliable core infrastructure.  Once this infrastructure is stronger and more established, it can act as an open framework for permissionless innovation and additional layers, this may offer greater flexibility than traditional systems which may ensure the system succeeds in the long run.  At the same time this robustness can ensure Bitcoin is a good monetary type asset.
People paying 8 cent for a transaction right now and the associated uncertainty over confirmations is a good thing to occur now, it helps us address the problem now and makes the system more robust for the future, when transaction levels may be much higher and dealing with congestion for the first time then could be very difficult.  The idea that we will stay at 4 transactions per second forever is a strawman argument put out by large blockers, everyone has a vision of much higher capacity, we just want to focus on making the system robust.
@_date: 2016-11-25 05:48:36


Please note use of the word **ever**


As it happens, I think, I agree with you on this and disagree with Satoshi.  However that is with respect to competing implementations.  With respect to deliberately incompatible implementations like BU, XT and Bitcoin Classic, I totallay agree with Satoshi, we should not have competing incompatible implementations and we should advise people against running these, unless there is strong consensus.
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:52:20


I do not know.  However users and miners are already running software without a checkpoint.  Implementing a checkpoint and getting all their users to upgrade during a dramatic battle with Bitcoin Core, is going to be a nightmare for them.


I have these candidate reasons:
* **Delusion:** BU supporters are highly convinced that they are right and that Bitcoin Core is spreading FUD about risks, they therefore believe this risk is also FUD.  They have a strong belief that once they get some momentum their victory will be resounding and the Core chain will be dead, because they grossly underestimate the passion and determination of those on the small block side to defend against a contentious hardfork, at all costs
* Lack of insight
* Stubbornness
* BU is only leverage anyway, there is no actual real desire for adoption
* Unable to realize they can have a dynamic checkpoint, to avoid the coordination problem of a fixed flag day
* This issue is somewhat inherent in BU anyway, once they admit this flaw, they have to admit the entire premise of BU is flawed
@_date: 2016-11-14 14:30:50
Unlike the August 2015 industry letter ( I completely agree with all the points in the image. In particular I think alternative implementations and competing development teams are great and should be encouraged.  One of the reasons I think competing development teams are great, is that it makes the rules more resilient, since consensus may be needed across many development teams before a hardfork, rather than just one.  This resilience can make Bitcoin a better money.
In contrast, competing deliberately **incompatible** implementations, which will result in chainforks, are probably a bad idea, and may cause confusion, reply attacks, new liabilities for custodians and loss of funds.  Users and miners should be encouraged not to run these incompatible implementations, that don't mitigate these risks.
@_date: 2016-11-02 11:55:39


No they don't.  Fees * volume needs to go up for security.  Some of the extreme large blockers somehow ignore the fee part of that equation, please don't do the opposite and ignore the volume part.
It would be great if more people used SegWit, so there is less malleability and quadratic scaling of sighash operations

Of course any hardfork proposal should go through many rounds of review, criticism, analysis, testing and rigerous skeptical evaluation.  This should ideally be done in a patient, non confrontational way.
Of course it should also be merit based. 
 
@_date: 2016-11-14 15:44:59


I think more competing implentations run by more miners would be great.


I agree.  I think competing for market share would be great. Unfortunately, I do not think competition over the protocol rules works.


The text doesnt say its a new thing.  In my view Bitcoin will eventually need to move into an era of multiple competing mining clients with multiple teams, we are not there yet as one client is dominant.  When we get there, ironically from the point of view of larger blockers, hardforks may be much harder.
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:37:17


No, I was not saying a safe hardfork would be a minority one at all.  In my example above (type 2), I said: 


i.e. it could achieve 1% of the hashrate and be a minority, or it could achieve 95% of the hashrate and be a majority fork.  As large blockers often put it "let the market decide", except they won't.
There were several differences between type 2 and type 3 above.  The main one is type 2 has a checkpoint, where the chains diverge and continue to exists.  Type 3 is asymmetric, in that both chains exists if the new chain is longer, however if the original chain takes the lead, the new chain ceases to exist.
Please try to understand how compelling investing in the original chain in an asymmetric hardfork is.  Understanding this is important.  Consider the below example:
Bitcoin Core coins vs BU coins:
* Step 1: BU gets 75% miner support and a 1.1MB block is produced
* Step 2. 24 hours later there has only been 30 Bitcoin Core blocks vs 110 BU blocks.  BU people think they have won
* Step 3. An altcoin exchange lists Bitcoin Core as a coin.  BU trades at $500, Bitcoin Core trades at $1
* Step 4. Speculators and hardcore Bitcoin Core supporters start to buy Bitcoin Core coins with their BU coins, and the price begins to rally.  People say its the "original/real Bitcoin" 
* Step 5. Like Ethereum Classic did to Ethereum on two occasions, Bitcoin Core coins reaches 30% of the price of BU coins
* Step 6. The Bitcoin Core coins hashrate begins to climb to match the price.  Some miners start using software that automatically mines the most profitable coin
* Step 7. Since the BU developers may not be as smart as Vitalik, they didn't put a checkpoint into the BU software.  If Bitcoin Core ever takes the lead, the BU clients will switch to the Bitcoin Core chain and the BU coins, BU supporters were buying, will cease to exist.  The price of Bitcoin Core coins would then rally
* Step 8. Traders start to realize this and then its game over.
* Step 9. Early buyers of Bitcoin Core coins made huge profits.  Please note, this community has many short term speculators that like nothing more than large short term gains.

Firstly SegWit is a blocksize limit increase, both literally (more actual data per block) and effectively (higher transaction capacity).  This is not a “small” increase, it is perhaps an increase of around 80%, which is pretty large.  In addition to this:
* Segwit fixes quadratic scaling of sighash operations, this makes future blocksize limit increases more likely, since we can increase the space for transactions without the quadratic scaling bug
* Segwit fixes known malleability, this makes future blocksize limit increases more likely, since we can increase the space for transactions without the malleability bug
* Segwit makes upgrades to the signature types easier, therefore upgrades to more efficient signature types, which increase capacity will become easier

I met him on several occasions, he seemed very nice and intelligent.  I disagree with him on how to hardfork and with respect to the blocksize limit.  I like it when I disagree with people, disagreement is a good thing.  Debate is healthy and a good tool for learning.  We should all try and recognize that we might be wrong.
@_date: 2016-11-16 03:32:25
If there is any ability to conduct a successful hardfork politically, then Bitcoin is pointless as it isn't sufficiently different form the USD to be interesting, in my view.
Roger/BU have a policy of trying to apply pressure to "Core" to get them to give in and hardfork.  We as a community must never give in to any kind of pressure to eliminate a protocol rule, which must be resilient against this kind of pressure.  If this happens once, Bitcoin is a failed experiment.
@_date: 2016-11-29 06:37:43


This is exactly what I want, "overwhelming support".  That is exactly my view and the view of most of the Core team.  The hardfork should be done in a collaborative way to get overwhelming support. The whole reason I strongly opposed Bitcoin Classic is because it never tried to ensure it had "overwhelming support". That is why I support the 95% threashold.  Once they agree with overwhelming support, then there is nothing to argue about!  **We all agree**.  This "war" is so frustrating, both sides simply refuse to listen to what the other side is saying.  Ironically the two sides views seem entirely compatible.  If they want overwhelming consensus, why are we fighting?


Then what are they complaining about then?  I thought they say they want to let the market decide.  If they want to do the hardfork in a safe way where they do not lose money.  They should collaborate with Core and end the hostilities.
I simply do not get it.
           
@_date: 2016-11-30 07:30:20


Many Core developers are reluctant to support any hardfork during a significant attempt to hardfork without the pre-condition of consensus.  This is because there is an idea that in the event of an attempt to do a hardfork without consensus, the community should rally behind the existing rules.  This behavior is considered crucial to ensure the rules are robust and to avoid a catastrophic chain split.
The assumption that people should bahave like this has existed for many years, however this is clearly not as widely understood or appreciated as many thought.  I think it is vital for the "large blockers" to at least understand why the Core team is behaving this way, even if they disagree.
I am confident that if both sides understand each others concerns better, we can make progress.

Full blocks are inevitable anyway.  So its good we learn to deal with them as soon as possible, to help make the network resilient for the future.

Please provide the full context, Satoshi was responding to someone who created a patch to increase the blocksize.  Satoshi said:




Then Satoshi went on to describe how a blocksize increase could be done in a safer way, which was your your quote above.  That is all the current  developers are saying now, "don't use [BU/XT/Classic], it'll make you incompatible with the network", instead let's hardfork in a safer way.
Satoshi's example included a c10 month grace period.  Had Bitcoin Classic included a reasonable 10 month grace period rather than 28 days and some other reasonable safety mechanics, I am sure the community would have accepted Bitcoin Classic.   
Please can we end the campaigns to hardfork in a potentially unsafe way and instead  unite behind plans to hardfork in a safe  and collaborative way.  Unless anyone has any disadvantage of making a hardfork safer, this seems like a no brainer to me. Otherwise it's looks like we may get nowhere and be stuck with a small 1MB limit.       
@_date: 2016-11-25 19:30:44
This excuse is smarter than saying the reason is to exert leverage to put pressure on for a hardfork.  As saying that effectively blocks a hardfork, since many in the community are opposed to any hardfork brought about by any kind of threat or leverage, as that is seen to ruin the sound money use case of Bitcoin.

Do not forget that SegWit is also the faster way of increasing capacity.  As soon as SegWit activates, users can upgrade when they want and then get the full benefits of larger blocks almost instantly.
For a hardfork, users need to wait for everyone to upgrade, which can take around 12 months.

But most people will not upgrade!!  What about all the existing mobile wallets!
If you think Core are so powerful that everyone will upgrade to what Core says and quickly, then how will you hardfork the network away from Core?  You cannot have it both ways!

Because there has been a big war in Bitcoin since around August 2015, when XT launched.  People irrationally want to win the war, to legitimise their own actions, regardless of the actual impact on the system.  A hardfork to increase the blocksize represents victory for some.
Ironically for the other side, they also do not mind a hardfork to increase the blocksize, however it is vital to them that the confrontational tactics used are not seen as helping the hardfork occur, otherwise these confrontational tactics are legitimized and can be used again to achieve potentially unwanted changes.  This damages the integrity of the money.

In my view the Ethereum vs ETC split may have been a game changer here.  It demonstrated that one can speculate by backing the unpopular side of the chainfork.  Even if the existing Bitcoin community is united, new speculators could join the ecosystem and start to invest in and mine the other fork, to try and make a profit.

It is not a few random people online.  It is a well financed group with a significant hashrate.
If we need to wait forever, so be it.  Bitcoin was always going to reach a point where forking could not happen.  It's just a shame if it happens while we are stuck at 1MB.

In my view, this underestimates the high level of stubbornness, passion and determination people have to avoid a contentious hardfork.  In addition to this, 40 minute block times do not result in a significantly different network to 10 minute block times.  Also please remember the financial gains the backers of this original chain stands to make, in my scenario.


No it doesn't


Yes, markets can move fast, in both directions.  If one of the two coins falls to a low level, like $0.25, god knows how many people will want to buy it, causing positive price momentum.


Agreed, they may even do this automatically like the Ethereum Classic vs Ethereum situation.


There is also a strong incentive to back the original chain, if it has an asymmetric advantage.  The lower the price of the coins on the original chain, the more the miner could gain by mining it.

 I am not sure I understand the numbers.
 For the 50/50 simulation, this is my understanding of what the results mean:
* 61 times out of 1000 - the upgrade to a 2MB limit occurred without any smaller blocks being mined after the first larger block
* 392 times out of 1000 - the upgrade to a 2MB limit worked the first time, but one or more blocks on the smaller chain was mined before the 2MB block got 4 confirmations (or the 1st upgrade failed, and then the 2nd attempt worked without a smaller block chain block being mined)
* 211 times out of 1000 - the upgrade to to 2MB blocks failed once, then succeeded on the 2nd attempt, but at least one block was mined on the smaller block chain in the 2nd attempt (or the first 2 attempts failed and then the 3rd attempt succeeded without any smaller block chain blocks being mined) 
This means that of each attempt to upgrade to 2MB,  around 76% to 82% failed, even with 100% of miners running BU with AD=4.  That seems like a terrible idea to me.     
Even in the 60/40 split, the upgrade to 2MB fails around 65% of the time   
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:51:05


I agree.  But it is an argument which explains that full blocks are an inevitability.  This is one of the main points of disagreement.  The "larger blocks at any cost" group, seem to deny  that full blocks are either inevitable or necessary.
Once one appreciates full blocks are inevitable, it seems appropriate to go through the process of improving the user experience with full blocks now, rather than in several years time when the ecosystem may be much larger and more disruption may be caused.  Let's work together to build a robust and sustainable  platform for the future, a patient and  conservative long term outlook wins in the end.

Satoshi was responding to somebody who made a patch to increase the blocksize limit.  Satoshi said:


Source: 
Satoshi then went on to give an example of how one could increase the blocksize limit in a safer way.  Satoshi's example had a c10 month grace period.  If Bitcoin Classic had followed Satoshi's example by using some basic safety features in its activation methodology, perhaps we would be using Bitcoin Classic today.  However, now Core has implemented a larger blocksize limit increase than Bitcoin Classic was offering.
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:42:56


I totally agree
And not only that, the Core team has made significant actual  progress in the  area of scalability.  For example:
* Segwit, which includes linear scaling of sighash operations, malleability fixes, reducing the amount of data required by the signature generator and a large c110% **onchain** capacity increase
*  Libsecp256k1, which improved signature validation speeds by c7x
* A mempool limiting option mode for nodes
* Blocks only mode for nodes
* Reducing upload traffic
* Compact blocks
* Opt in RBF - helping the sender increase the priority of transactions 
* CPFP - helping the reciever increase the priority of transactions 
* Continued work on the development  of LN and payment channel technology
* Headers first
* Plus much much more

There are full nodes which validate all the rules, 100% of these would be required to upgrade in a hardfork situation or there will be a chain split.
As for the light clients you mention, these clients may partially validate the rules, therefore they may or may not require an upgrade, depending on the type of hardfork.  As far as I know, nobody has even bothered to check this for a blocksize limit increase 
As for SegWit, the brilliant part is we can get a massive capacity increase very quickly, without waiting for everyone in any group to upgrade, and yet all clients can send and receive funds from all other clients and a chainfork is not possible.  Therefore SegWit is a win, win, win situation.  It is  really a no brainer.

Well unfortunately it is kind of still on the Bitcoin network, depending on how you look at it.
For example turn on a Bitcoin-ABC node and you may find it spends  about 6 hours connecting to hundreds  of  compatible Bitcoin nodes,  before eventually finding some peers on it's own chain.

Why do we use miner signalling for softforks then?  In principal, don't "99% of the economy" have the same ability to impose a softfork, just like a hardfork? Is miner signalling just a pragmatic shortcut?  If miners do not activate SegWit, can we perhaps consider trying to enforce it from non mining nodes using this 2 year flag day idea?
* An economic super majority of non mining nodes can impose a softfork on the network, or
* 51% of the miners can impose a softfork on the network
* An economic super majority of non mining nodes can impose a hardfork on the network, however
* 51% of mining nodes **CANNOT** impose a hardfork on the network

No it is literally an increase in the blocksize

This just makes it difficult to have multiple competing independent implementations, doesn't mean it is something we shouldn't aim for in the longer term.  I think multiple competing independent implementations is a good thing which makes the Bitcoin rules more robust, since consensus may be required from many development teams, rather than just one, before a hardfork.  Ironically not what the large blockers want.
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:53:52


these people typically confuse the protocol rules of Bitcoin (which we need consensus to changes) with one particular client, like Bitcoin Core (when anyone can run whatever compatible client they like with no issues, e.g. Bitcoin Knots, BTCD ect ect)

But a single miner may only mine one block.  Why would they then care about the impact that one block has on the fee market for other miners?  That one miner may want to only maximize fee revenue in that one block.

I think it will take years of discussion, testing and consensus building before a client people should run for BIP100 is released.  Unfortunately The climate in the community does  not seem health enough to effectively do this process.  The same process  should have been true for BU, especially since it is extremely complex and novel.


There are many issues which need to  be addressed and testing the BU team need to do before encouraging people to run their client.  In my view the BU team has been irresponsible in asking the community to run the client, which has many dangerous outstanding issues.


I really don't think so

What benefits does SegWit2x have over Bitcoin Cash?
Bitcoin Cash has:
* Many of the advantages of SegWit since it uses BIP143 (a key part of SegWit).  Bitcoin Cash fixes the quadratic hashing bug by using a new new transaction digest algorithm for signature verification.  Therefore it has better scaling properties than SegWit2x (B2X)
* Twice the capacity of B2X
* Strong two way replay protection, unlike B2X
* Since the downward difficult adjustment, Bitcoin Cash as an incompatible block header, granting protection to mobile wallets (unlike B2X)
* Bitcoin Cash already exists and seems to be going well
What is the point of launching yet another 8MB hardfork coin, technically inferior to the 8MB hardfork coin that just launched?  B2X is utter madness, as well as being a hostile attack on Bitcoin due to the lack of basic safety features.
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:07:09


There is nothing anyone can do about that.  A hardfork blocksize limit increase does not help here either.  Old nodes will still have a 1MB limit, even after a hardfork.

Exactly, 95% has been successfully used many times in the past.  If it doesn't work we may need to review it. If it does work we can keep it. Abandoning the 95% threshold may just mean forking takes a lot longer as we need to wait for everyone to upgrade

I do not agree with this.  The component parts of the code are interrelated in a complex way, involving game theory, economics, computer science and cryptography, in a way in which very few people understand.

Well it clearly does rely on "social consensus" for the scenario Noosterdam mentioned, where there is a toggle option for a checkpoint.  I also think it applies to AD


I think the maximum is 999,999


Yes, looking at the network and seeing what 80% of others are doing, then making a decision, seems analogous to social consensus with your friends to me.  That is not to say this doesn't work, "social consensus with your friends" probably works very well, its just that its not as robust as Bitcoin, its also not new and not unique.  It won't work at scale.
@_date: 2016-11-21 10:57:16


I agree with this.  But we need to recognize that Bitcoin is not perfect and does have vulnerabilities.  An alternative  implementation can be a "menace" (as Satoshi called it) and the community rallying together and advising people not to run this incompatible version is part of what makes Bitcoin robust.


When making comments like this I think its important to recognize that not all hardforks are the same.  Consider three possibilities below:
**1 - "Strong consensus" hardfork - Potentially Safe**
The hardfork occurs on the condition that there is no significant opposition in any section of the community. A minority has veto power. The activation threshold could be a 95% softfork, imposing a new rule that miners MUST flag support for a hardfork, which will then occur after say 6 months.  Bitcoin Core seems to advocate something like this.
**2 - "Chain split" hardfork - Potentially Safe**
e.g. The Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic hardfork, or Bitcoin Clams
One section of the community disagrees with another part of the community and wants to go in a different direction. A flag day or checkpoint is set when the two chains diverge. A strategy is in place to mitigate the replay attack problem. There is no activation threshold and miner support for the new chain can be very small or very high. (Let the market decide)
**3 - Harkfork with large mining split and asymmetric advantage - Unnecessarily dangerous**
e.g. BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic, BU
There is a hardfork attempt that activates at a specific miner threshold that ensures both chains may survive, e.g. 75% vs 25%. (Even worse there is rolling voting, unnecessarily guaranteeing a significant miner split at the point of no return, rather than voting windows, which only makes a large miner split possible). At the same time the original chain has the ability to "wipe out" the new chain if it becomes longer than it, erasing its history and causing loss of funds. The characteristic that people lose funds makes this method dangerous. It is unnecessarily dangerous in that there is no significant advantage in allowing the funds to be erased. However, the new chain can never wipe out the old chain. This type of hardfork is particularly dangerous as the more successful the new chain is, the more compelling it is for speculators to try and erase it and make profits.  This makes victory for the old chain highly likely.  Investing in the old chain can offer large profits to speculators, who can capitalize on the asymmetric nature of the hardfork.  Please note, that despite what BU/XT supporters say, which is the 10 minute target time ensures the 25% chain won't produce any significant number of blocks, exchanges do not need to wait for blocks to be produced to allow their customers to start trading the two coins against each other and allow the price of the old coins to rally, in a speculative, self-fulfilling, highly profitable frenzy.  As an investor, I hope you appreciate how compelling that opportunity is.
The reason many people so strongly oppose BU, XT and Bitcoin Classic, is because they feel its the textbook example of the worst kind of hardfork, that has a very high probability of ensuring people lose funds and the integrity of the system is damaged.  As Satoshi put it, it "can be pretty ugly for the minority version".  
Something very similar to a type 2 hardfork and chainsplit has happened to Bitcoin before, see 
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:46:53




That makes no sense.  You cannot put the USD v BTC exchange rate inside the consensus rules.  
Minimum fees would also be central planning, that could result in demand drying up if nobody pays the fees or lack or mining rewards relative to the size of the system if it grows.  Instead we should have a free floating fee rate, determined by the market, with nodes enforcing the supply constraint, preferably in a dynamic way, like BIP100.  But for now nodes enforce a 1MB rule, until their is consensus to change it.


You ignore propagation and validation costs here.  Also please consider worst case attack validation costs.  We must think  with an adversarial mindset.  Bitcoin needs to be resilient against attacks and we must assume there are attackers (See Ethereum for an example).  
For example BU proponents often assume there will not be attackers.  With BU a miner can create a block of the median EB setting, splitting the hashrate into two groups, of arbitrary size, whenever the attacker wants.  When I point this out, the BU supporters and developers say, "miners will not do that, they are not stupid".
So what is the CPU cost for the worst case attack block, with one massive hard to validate transaction taking up all the space?


No, not at all. I am happy with big businesses using Bitcoin, just like anyone else.  I am just trying to explain why full blocks are inevitable and that we therefore need users to outbid each other to get on the chain.
I still want massive capacity increases and low fees (e.g. 10 cent or less), I just want a fee market, where users compete for limited blockspace.

BU only works when the node operator is present and deciding things, to achieve "social consensus" with their friends (This can actually be achieved with an email distribution list).  Even magically ticking check-boxes which do not currently exists.  The "Core" philosophy is that Bitcoin works when the node operator isn't monitoring the node 24 hours a day.
Every-time someone points out a problem with BU, they indicate they could solve it, however they haven't solved it yet, but recommend people run BU now anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:01:20
Be very careful sending BCASH first, as you may not want to import your "live" private key into a new BCASH wallet.
Instead, send the Bitcoin first, but to yourself, so in the unlikely event you are  replayed, it's not the end of the world.  After your Bitcoin transaction has several confirmations, then import your "old" private key into your BCASH wallet and do the split.
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:47:25


If there is a problem with this, then what stops the BU team from going another layer deeper into complexity?  Each time you get diminishing returns to the time you spend analysing the system.  At some point you have to make a judgement that the level of complexity is too high to be worth digging into. 


 In my view these are not solutions, but they are just an abstraction, making it more challenging to concisely point at the problem.
Are you honestly saying changing AD, so it's now partly based on an algorithm related to blocksize and your local EB setting is elegant?
I thought many BU people do not like SegWit as it is too complex?
      
@_date: 2016-12-05 06:26:26


Yes, but part of that resilience is the community doing something about it.
If everyone just does nothing and says, "oh well, either BU is defeated or Bitcoin is rubbish anyway", BU will probably win.

@_date: 2016-11-16 08:41:46


Yes it is.  One eliminates a Bitcoin rule, the other doesn't.  The is no problem with politics, only using politics to eliminate a Bitcoin rule is the problem.  The rules need to be resilient against political interference to ensure the system works as money.


Whether it makes it stronger or not is not the point.  Not being able to change the rules by politics makes it **unique**


Yes this is a problem.  In private everyone talks, but in public people dont want to be attacked.

1. How do you get to 70%, without first getting to near 50%?
2. You do realize that c70% is around the level each side has a 50:50 chance of winning, it is pretty much the worst level to choose.  I know BU is not exactly the same, due to the complexity of the AD setting, but if AD is large enough, 70% supporting larger blocks and 30% supporting smaller blocks, makes it a c50:50 battle


But AD could be almost any number...

@_date: 2016-11-30 07:56:18


Good question, I think there is no clear definition.
I would say the characteristics of pre-condition of consensus are:
* Do not campaign to run the incompatible client before widespread agreement in the community
* Proponents stating that they will only run the hardfork code if there is consensus.  Unlike XT/Classic for example, when supporters specifically indicated there was an unhappy minority 
* Having a high activation threshold
* If people are unhappy, politely, respectfully and patiently listen to their views and then try to mitigate their concerns
In practical terms, I think the normal 95% activation threshold is fine.  However it could be lower.  The more contentious the fork, the higher the threshold should be
@_date: 2016-11-22 06:21:51


Its most work, I just use the "longest chain" language as a simplification


But as I explained, investors may prefer the old chain, since it has this asymmetric risk reward profile.  Miners may then follow investors.


This is not true in the case of an asymmetric hardfork.  For example:
* in a 55% vs 45% battle, the 45% group will win c60% of the time, when it has the asymmetric advantage
* in a 75% vs 25% battle, the 25% group will win c21% of the time, when it has the asymmetric advantage
 
This just assumes the hashrate remains still and ignores the appeal of the old chain to investors.
The 51% rules idea does not apply in hardfork situations, which can be more complicated.

Luckily everyone agrees with the need for more capacity, so we do not have a problem here.  However as the hostilities and vitriol continue, unfortunately it makes some types of capacity increases very hard.  If this continues for several more years, it may not be possible to hardfork (or maybe if it gets really bad, even softfork).  This would make capacity increases very difficult.  
While that would be a huge shame, its not the end of the world.  Maybe LN developers would need to think of innovative ways around Bitcoin's unfortunate capacity problems.

@_date: 2016-12-10 03:11:17


I do not agree with this.  Having a simple economic majority is not sufficient for consensus to move onto the new hardfork chain.  Please think through these processes  and dynamics in a bit more detail.  In my view an economic **super**majority may be required to hardfork.
Let's look through some of the dynamics in a bit more detail:
* **Miners** - 51% of miners is not sufficient.  If you run through and simulate the upgrade to larger blocks, with something like BU, XT or Bitcoin Classic, you will see that the 51% lose and become the shorter chain c80% of time.  This assumes support for the larger chain remains at 51% of miners.  Even at 70% support for the new hardfork chain, it's a 50:50 battle, to decide which chain has the most work 
* **Investors/traders** - Even if the new hardfork chain has support of a majority of investors.  A hardfork like BU, XT and Bitcoin Classic gives the original chain a massive economic asymmetric advantage to investors on the old chain.  Since the old chain has the ability to wipe the new chain out while the new chain cannot wipe the old chain out.  This ensures the old chain can have more economic value, even with minority economic support, since the old chain has favourable asymmetric investment returns.
* **Nodes operators** - 100% of the full nodes will support the original chain, whilst only a simple majority support the new hardfork chain.  Therefore the old chain has the advantage here, even when the majority of node operators support the new hardfork chain.  A simple majority is not sufficient to hardfork.  In addition to this there will be a sticky tail of slow people who do not upgrade to the hardfork no matter what, crucial allies to those opposed to the hardfork, which supporters of the hardfork do not have. 
* **Custodians and exchanges** - A simple majority may support the new hardfork chain, however custodians and exchanges may have an ethical and legal obligation to support both chains, as their primary duty must be to protect customer assets.  Therefore having a simple majority support the new hardfork chain, from this group, may be meaningless.
* **Merchants** - Rather than taking risks like following the simple economic majority, perhaps sensible merchants would stop using Bitcoin at this point 
* **Developers** - I would hope most developers continue to work on a client version which is solid and robust, as well as having the best technical merit.  Rather than being fickle and switching to a chain that has a marginal short term simple economic majority.  I would hope developers are more resilient than that.
**What I think is hard to appreciate, is that the above factors are interelated and combined they can make the minority opposition to a contentious hardfork very powerful.  This is why, in my view, a minority does have veto power over a hardfork, whether one likes it or not. Personally I do like this characteristic, because I think its quite unique and this is one of the main reasons I became interested in Bitcoin.**
I hope the above demonstrates that 51% majority support from the ecosystem is not sufficient for a hardfork.  Whatever the process for a hardfork is, I hope I have demonstrated to you that it is very different to the normal process of deciding  between different valid competing blocks.
EDIT: (I know my claim about veto power is controversial, so I will try to explain further)
Please see: 
When considering a hardfork attempt like BU/XT and Classic I think the below is true.


This is analogous to:


The Kosher population represents less than **0.3%**  of  the  residents  of  the  United  States.  However almost  all drinks are Kosher. Why? Simply because going full Kosher allows the producer, grocer, restaurant, to not have to distinguish between Kosher and nonkosher for liquids,  with  special  markers,  separate  aisles,  separate  inventory and separate supply chains.


Which explains why many schools are peanut free.
As the author continues:


BU, XT and Classic have this same asymmetric nature built into them.  This essentially hands veto power over to an unhappy minority, in the event of a contentious hardfork. It doesn't need to be this way, we can still hardfork.  There are essentially three choices:
* Do a non contentious hardfork
* Do a hardfork without this asymmetric mechanism built in, i.e. a checkpoint with a flag day, leading potentialy to two viable coins
* An evil hardfork, where upgraded miners censor all transactions on the original chain 
           
@_date: 2016-12-10 00:33:27
Which attack 
@_date: 2016-12-09 01:00:38


There are some things Ethereum has done very well, relative to BU, in my view:
* Etheruem devs were smart enough to put a checkpoint in their contentious hardfork, so they could not be "wiped out" if the original chain becomes longer.  BU does not use such a checkpoint and is vulnerable to a total wipe-out
*  Etheruem devs have been smart enough not to significantly interfere with the core longest valid chain rules idea in Bitcoin, unlike BU in which **validity depends on the number of confirmations**
* Etheruem's gas  limit concept based on miner voting, is significantly better than BU, which has everyone set their own blocksize limit, such that there is no fast and effective convergence on one chain
@_date: 2016-12-09 02:17:48


I really do not agree with that.  This is like a housing company trying to sell houses with poor foundations and no disclaimers, making them vulnerable to a collapse, but then defending this by saying that the houses looked rubbish anyway, so it was unlikely many people would buy them.
In my view that is grossly irresponsible
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:16:39


That thinking is not only wrong, but the opporsite is true.  Segwit makes the system more capable of handeling larger blocks and makes an increase in the non witness blocksize limit far more likely.  For example:
* **Linear scaling of sighash operations** - Before SegWit, as transactions got bigger they would take a longer and longer time for computers to verify them.  With the improvements in SegWit, larger transactions will only take a bit more time to verify.  **This means it is now safer to have larger blocks.**
* **Malleability fixes** - Before SegWit, somebody else could see your transaction before it was confirmed and change it a bit, this causes all kinds of problems, like making it harder to chain transactions.  This is a bug and therefore people wanted to fix this before increasing the blocksize limit, otherwise more space would be created for these buggy transactions. **This means it is now safer to have larger blocks.**
Also, I remember last year many in the community wanted Bitcoin Classic, which was a bump to 2MB blocks.  SegWit is a larger increase than this and the benefits for users that upgrade is faster than Bitcoin Classic.  Bitcoin Classic had a 28 day grace period, Segwit only has a 14 day grace period, and after that point users who upgrade get the full benefits of a c100% capacity increase right away, without needing to wait for others to upgrade to SegWit

I was thinking more of a deliberate attack.  I guess this can also happen by accident.


Yes I do think this is a potentially very serious attack, with severe impacts.  Please see me try to outline some below:
* During this attack, there is effectively network downtime.  All a miner needs to do is produce a block to DoS the network.  In my view, we should try to keep network downtime to a minimum
* The resolution to this attack could take a while, especially if the chain with larger blocks has the lead.  This is because we may need to wait for miners AD thresholds to be reached, and AD can be a large value
* The attacker can get 50% free assistance with a double spend attack.  For example, existing light wallets such as the commonly used Breadwallet all have AD=1 (As far as I understand, or it may be infinity which could be even worse for BU).  As an attacker I could make a payment to multiple Breadwallet users, mine a median EB block and have 50% of the hashrate support my double spend attempt for free
* Other users could see the split and opportunistically try to perform double spend attacks
* This attack vector produces wasted work, this reduces the efficiency and security of the network.  i.e. the total work of the chain deceases.   This may be of particular concern for BU, which may be in a protracted battle with Core, over who has the most work chain


In my view, BU somewhat alters the core "longest chain rule" idea, any changes to this area are probably highly risky and highly complex.  They seem to take us right back to the core principals of the Bitcoin design, which is the highly convergent nature of the system.  I therefore do not see any "obvious" think one could do in this area.
Personally I am strongly in favor of a dynamic market driven blocksize limit.  I support BIP100, which is where miners vote for whether the limit should go up or down.

I know a lot of people do not think storage is a massive issue, however I find it an issue.  If you want to run a Bitcoin node on an SSD VPS without pruning, the storage is likely to be the most expensive item.

I thought using EB as a signalling mechanism to increase the blocksize was a core component of BU.
If it doesn't do that, and instead everyone  runs the same EB and a high AD value, BU appears totally pointless then, since it doesn't do anything.
My point is that if the EB mechanism is used, there are weaknesses and vulnerabilities.   If it is not used, then I have no issues with it.  But that should go without saying.

How does the cartel prevent defections then?


In Bitcoin mining defecting from the cartel is easier than almost any other industry.  Actually the characteristics of Bitcoin mining that make it great make a cartel very hard to enforce. E.g low barriers of entry and exit.


Indeed, in the protocol rules.


I disagree with the fee rules and prefer a blocksize limit rule.  Why not enforce this rule at the protocol level rather than having orphans taking wallets by surprise?  These orphan plans reduce the convergence of the network and increase double spend risk.  It should be a rule.
 &gt; There is no technical limit on the number of miners who vote on the fee. No additional centralization necessary. 
Sorry.  I do not follow
@_date: 2016-11-30 09:37:58
Well I always hoped we would reach a period of significant and permanent tension in the community such that hardforking would not be possible.  I just thought it would happen later on when the community was much larger.  
I think its great if this has happened early and the rules are already that robust.
The only problem is it now means we are stuck with small 1MB blocks, which is a shame.  Unless SegWit happens and we get larger blocks that way
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:19:09


The Bitcoin community has, to some extent, broken down into two rival groups.  The dialog between each group is poor and each group has their own inconsistent narrative.  Part of the narrative on the “larger block” side is that the other side does not want competing alternative implementations.  They do not deliberately say this to stir up tension knowing it’s false, in my view, they genuinely believe this.
For example look at the recent presidential election in the US between Trump and Hillary.  Each side has their own narrative which seems to include the idea that the other side is evil and stupid.  The quality of dialog and debate between these sides is extremely poor and people tended to consume media that was only reporting things already consistent with their existing narrative.  The gap between each side grew wider.  Even after one side lost, many on the losing side, continued their narrative and became depressed, claiming evil and stupidity have now taken over.
Bitcoin has a similar problem, if the “large blockers” lose, many will become depressed and think the side that doesn’t want competing implementations has won.  This is the largest problem in Bitcoin at the moment, far more serious than actual scalability or capacity issues, in my view.
I think it is therefore important to keep trying to improve the dialog and quality of debate between the two sides and emphasis again and again, that competing implementations and competing teams is not seen as a negative, by the “small blockers”.  At the same time, I recognize that I am personally very bad at doing this and probably not helping.

The existing chain cannot implement strong replay protection, all this would do would be to create another hardfork and a new coin.  (I doubt this coin would be very popular)

People can start using SegWit 2 weeks after it activates.  No grace period is required, like c12 months for a hardfork. 
I have spoken to large exchanges who are responsible for a huge amount of TX volume.  They plan to upgrade right away.  That will free up huge amounts of space for the rest of us who do not upgrade. 
After everyone  upgrades we get a c110% capacity increase

I used to find this easy, however after network throughput increased this became almost impossible and the RPi kept crashing.

But the Bitcoin Core team never improves anything and has done absolutely nothing to respond to greater Bitcoin usage.  /s

I sure the community is happy to follow on the 2nd part.  As long as the hardfork is not the result of any kind of threat, that would be intolerable, because the integrity of the money would be compromised.  Bitcoin's rules must be resilient or the whole system is pointless.

Specifics of what?  Specifics of why BU is a drastic change?
 One example is that with BU, each miner sets their local EB parameter and puts it in their blocks.  A malicious miner could cause disruption by finding a block that has a size equal to the median of these EB values, splitting the hashrate into two equal groups, whenever they like.  This has a number of negative effects, including:
* the ability to DoS the network at will,
* reduce the mining difficulty,
* lack of convergence onto one chain,
* making the system harder to use (especially for people not keeping track of all the complex AD &amp; EB dynamics or light client users), and
* assisting with conducting double spend attacks.
Is that a drastic and specific enough change in BU for you?
Now the chief developer of BU says an AD setting of 10 is a good idea to address the vulnerability described in this post.  This makes BU even less convergent in the face of this "median EB value" attack.

As the ecosystem matures and more people and businesses  are interested in blockchains, demand for  blockspace is essentially unbounded.  This was not the case for the first 6 years or so, when Bitcoin was a small niche thing, but now it's coming out of its small libertarian geek niche and businesses will try to use the blockchain for a large range of things.  It is therefore inevitable that blocks will be full, whatever limit is set. (Many also consider full block necessary and some disagree, but this is a moot point, if you understands its inevitable anyway)


This is exactly why we need full  blocks now.  We need to mitigate or solve the negative consumer experience of full blocks now, rather than later, since full blocks are eventually inevitable.
I have been very impressed with the progress we have made:
* adoption of dynamic fees
* child pays for parent 
* Opt in RBF 
However there is still a long way to go.  For example improments in merchant processes, like hiding delays in confirmation from the consumer, in the c98% of use cases when speed is not relevant.  (For example delays are not relevant for subscription services or contract service, any service with ID verification, ordering when the fulfillment time is long, buying tickets for events in the future, buying when the retalier knows you or has security cameras in store, ect ect)

Sorry, this is a difficult issue, and using the right language to explain can be challenging 


I'm sorry.  I need to repeat again.  Some people are reluctant to even put foward a proposal during an attempt to campaign for users to run an incompatible client without consensus.  The strategy is to be prudent and rally behind the existing rules to ensure the hardfork attempt without consensus fails and then put foward  proposals
Putting forward one proposal while there are other proposals are made  is of course fine.


I totally agree.  I think that's great.  I think non binding miner voting is great.  Bw.com is voting for 8mb, which is great.  In contrast via btc is running incompatible code before consensus, which could be dangerous.  At one point 65% of miners were voting for my favourite BIP100 solution.  However, unfortunately nobody seemed to listen to the vote and the XT/BU aggressive campaigns continued.


Yes they have.  They even put forward BIP103, which would lead to 1GB blocks.  However the large blockers seemed to refuse to compromise  and the aggressive campaign to hardfork without consensus continued.
   
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:27:53


Yes exactly.  My point is, if  its political then one may assume any upgrade will be rejected, not just unpopular ones.  In that case it looks like there may be no more protocol changes.  This could be a problem, as for example increasing capacity would be much harder.
Of course many had always assumed we would reach this state eventually, however I thought this would happen much later on and the developers would have many more years to do much needed upgrades to the protocol . 
@_date: 2016-11-21 12:07:39


As a Core supporter I would say do nothing.  With 25% that is not much of a problem, one block every 40 minutes is fine.  Remember, exchanges can list the coins even if no blocks are produced.  


I would advice against this.  I think Core supporters tend to be more patient than BU supporters.  I would say we keep the asymmetric advantage in the back of our minds and patiently wait and start slowing selling our BU coins for Core Coins.

In this case, since everyone is assumed to have AD=4, the maximum fork is 4 blocks.


That did not stop the following being mentioned in the results:






Of course the maximum cannot ever be greater than 4, yet mentioning how great it is that there was only ever a maximum of 4 in the simulation, was done three times in the blog

I had never thought of that.  This seems interesting.  (Users may want to do some kind of replay defense before using large fees)


Implementing a checkpoint and getting their users to upgrade, right in the middle of a dramatic battle with Bitcoin Core and the speculators, may be challenging.

As AD settings increase, the system is more resilient against this attack, however it makes the system less convergent and more vulnerable to the median EB attack.  This trade off requires more analysis before people are recommended to run BU, in my view.
You mentioned people should have AD = 10.  


If you run your simulation at that level, you will see there are far more orphaned chain forks.  For example a 50/50 split would result in a c80% failure rate for larger block upgrade attempts.  This point needs to be addressed as many BU supporters and advocates seem to think, 51% means they win.  Well actually, 51% means the larger block chain is wiped out 80% of the time.
Also please note that the BU miners and node operators tend to use a much smaller AD setting than 10.  Perhaps further education about the risks associated with the AD setting is required before people run BU.


Which change?  Removing the sticky gate or having the AD adjustment algorithm?
For the "sticky gate", why was the local EB not increased to the size of the excessive block for 144 blocks, rather than the limit being totally removed for 144 blocks?
**Side point**
Also, FYI, I do not actually think I agree with your point about removing the sticky gate makes BU that much less convergent.  I think it may be nearly as convergent as before, which is not very convergent, in my view.  Your simulation is for miners constantly trying to increase the blocksize every block, therefore removal of the sticky gate is massively divergent, however I do not think miners will do this, to the extent in your simulation.  I think you should also simulate other miner strategies.  Then you may find BU fails to converge effectively for almost all non uniform variations of AD and EB settings.

The reason for this is it takes too much time to receive and validate the previous block.  This is causing validationless mining, which reduces network security.  This shows we are already suffering some negative consequences of  large blocks.  I do think the blocksize limit should increase, but it's important to do it in a conservative and cautious way. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 09:58:15
In the first few years, Bitcoin was a niche product for cyberpunks, innovators, geeks or libertarians.  We need to be realistic and appreciate that the Blockchain essentially provides a highly replicated and robust storage solution, demand for that is essentially unbounded, at a low enough fee.  There is now considerable corporate interest in Bitcoin, Banks are doing R&amp;D, supply chain companies are thinking of projects, the largest mining company in the world, BHP, apparently wants to put a rock database on the blockchain.  We may not like it, but we need to face up to the reality that whatever the blocksize limit is, the chain is likely to be full, at some point.  Instead of putting our heads in the sand, lets deal with that.

Can miner signalling for a hardfork still be helpful for light clients that only partially enforce the rules?  If the hardfork breaches a rule that a light client is not enforcing, then miner signalling could help let these light clients know which side of the fork they will follow.  (Although I guess the support miners give to each side of the fork could change after the flag day, especially if financial markets and traders start to get involved)

The speed of segwit adoption may be roughly proportional to how much people care about fees.  If they care about fees there will be more incentive to upgrade.
In my view most actual users don't care that much about a 6 cent fee, and even that may fall quickly as large exchanges quickly upgrade to SegWit, freeing up more space for others.
@_date: 2016-12-22 02:09:19


I am not sure I understand this.  Why does it matter what the overall network transaction capacity of the network is?  **As soon as SegWit activates, anyone who wants to upgrade and get the full benefits of higher capacity for their own transactions, can do so, "overnight".**  Is this not what matters?
Why is a hardfork solution to increase the blocksize limit any better than that?  
* **For a hardfork** -  anyone that upgrades gets higher capacity "overnight" and anyone that does not upgrade is on a separate chain, with a different coin
* **For SegWit** - anyone that upgrades gets higher capacity "overnight" and anyone that does not upgrade can continue on the same chain

I couldn't agree more.  A split like this may reduce the ecosystem size by at least 90%
@_date: 2016-11-19 22:51:46
Pretty much everyone is in favour of a moderate blocksize limit increase. The problem is a coordination problem, which is for a hardfork the community all needs to upgrade together to the same new set of rules. This is very difficult to do in a confrontational climate, for example when hardfork attempts like Classic or BU are occuring, which do not attempt to solve the coordination problem or mitigate any risks of a chain split. This confrontational approach makes it even more dangerous as it can create stubboness. This means many people feel they need to rally behind the existing 1MB rule to protect the system, despite really wanting larger blocks.

I see, so your comment is not about the vulnerabilities related to the sticky gate or lack of the sticky gate, instead you think critical vulnerabilities are not possible?


Indeed, its a massive stretch.  It is also a massive stretch for any database administrators in the traditional banking system to act maliciously.  In-fact traditional database operators in the existing widely adopted financial system perform very well over 99.999% of the time.  After all these database administrators get fees, why would they want to act maliciously when their business depends on these fees?  They are also tightly regulated and have well established compliance and monitory procedures.  These traditional database administrators are far more reliable than Bitcoin miners.
The only effective difference between Bitcoin and traditional financial databases is there are extra mechanisms and incentives preventing miners acting maliciously which do exist for traditional banking database administrators.  This makes the system more censorship resistant than traditional database architectures.  Bitcoin users pay a huge cost for this one feature, the system is slower, less efficient, more difficult to use and more expensive.  If you do not think censorship resistance is unique, valuable or important, do not invest in or use Bitcoin.
Assuming miners will not be malicious, which may be true for c99.999% of the time, is therefore pointless.


Many BU attack vectors do not require that at all.  Take the "Median EB blocksize" attack, a **miner only has to find one block once**, to split the hashrate into two equal groups, every single day.  Effectively totally  grinding the system to a halt indefinitely, with just 0.7% of the hashrate.


This has not been fixed.  The lead developer just suggested a fix that completely changes BU and makes is far more complex.  This doesn't fix anything but only obfuscates the issue into deeper more complex layers.  Did you even read his comment, he said AD could have an algorithm relating it to the size of the block.


No it is not.  BU can be easily halted by somebody with just 0.7% of the hashrate, as I explained.


BU is a private members organization, non members are not even allowed to submit proposals.


No i do not.

Ok, I didn't realise that.  But you see my point, it can be done.


I am not sure this point matters all that much, in terms of the dynamics of the hardfork.  As long as you have the UTXO set
@_date: 2016-11-14 09:01:04
I think the smart thing to do is to prioritize unique features over more generic ones.  Fast and cheap transactions are not unique, censorship resistance and robustness are.

The launch of XT seems to have had a very negative impact on the community.  I think if we actually focus on the protocol rather than some web forum, it's likely we can make  more progress to consensus
@_date: 2016-12-07 03:51:31
Yes.  It also depends on what the objective of the spam attack is.  If the objective is to put as much spam as possible on the Blockchain, then 2MB blocks make the attack far cheaper.
@_date: 2016-12-04 12:34:07


Lets say that in ten years time we have the following:
* 50MB blocksize limit
* 40x the number of Bitcoin users
* Typical blocks are 40MB big, with 10MB of spare space
* Then, a large bank, IT company, mining company or supply chain business decides to put a large percentage of their business on the blockchain, they generate 250MB of data every ten minutes
Then we suddenly have full blocks.  All the users and merchants start complaining.  The user wallets do not have dynamic fees, miners are not using CPFP or RBF.  Merchants do not give the consumer an instant experience on zero conf and then revoke the goods if the transaction doesn't confirm.  There is no fix to malleability, no fee market, people still using 0-conf, no merchants using CPFP, no schnor signatures, no fix to quadratic hashing, no MAST, no payment channels, no segregated witness.  We then cannot increase the blocksize to relive  fee pressure, since it will cause too much centralization.  The users will then complain about the "new normal" of full blocks.
Is it not better to start sorting these issues out now, while we are smaller, to cause less user pain in the future?  I am investing in Bitcoin because I think it can be a robust and sustainable system in the future.  Smaller blocks now is not the most obvious decision, but it is the smart strategic decision.


I am referring to a lot.  Mostly the difficulties users currently get with full blocks


Other coins come close to Bitcoin in many ways.  One area Bitcoin has an absolutely massive technical lead is scalability!!!


I agree.  But if Bitcoin starts competing over the speed of the transaction, throughput or how easy it is to use, with centralized systems, Bitcoin is going to lose.  We should not risk the one thing Bitcoin can win at in the long run, censorship resistance, for areas Bitcoin has no sustainable competitive advantage.  Lets be smart.  Lets priorities what is unique.
@_date: 2016-11-29 04:36:23
One difference is we get larger blocks.
I think some dynamic solutions can heavily mitigate this problem.  For example miner voting on the blocksize in the block header with 51% required to vote for a change, miners vote as a group and benefit as a whole from the result.  The voting period could be very long, e.g. 100k blocks, to mitigate the impact of various gaming strategies.  This is like BIP100
This is in contrast to the median of last N blocks idea, as miners benefit from filling up their own blocks.  The voting seems to solve many of the tragedy  of the  commons type problems with the median of last N blocks idea, however unfortunately many totally deny these problems exist, which is delaying progress.

Bitcoin has no sustainable competitive advantage in micotransactions.  The smart move is to focus on censorship resistance, an area Bitcoin has a sustainable lead over competing payment networks.  Then we can try to build microtransactions on other layers.
It doesn't seem like a smart long term move to sacrifice an area Bitcoin has a sustainable competitive advantage for an area it doesn't.  We need to think strategically here.

Well it depends.  It you agree with the BU, XT and Classic people, that the most work chain is the one true chain, even if it violates existing rules, then the 21m is only an expected rule.  
If you think the one true chain is the most work valid chain, and your node enforces validity, then yes you can ensure there are never more than 21m coins.  This is why people are taking such a tough stance on the block size issue.
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:28:22
I thought new versions of LND check the counterparty before closing a channel, to check if the other party has a later state. If both nodes are honest and the counterparty is online, the node won't broadcast an earlier state even if it lost the later state.

I think if most of the community actually patiently listened to each other in a respectful way, they would realize there is actually no significant difference of vision and a hardfork leading to a permanent chainsplit is not necessary.  However, if we continue to refuse to listen to each other in a responsible way, perhaps the BU/XT people could consider a type 2 hardfork.  However, when one suggests this to them, they typically say no, as they do not want the market to decide, they only want to hardfork if they have at least 51% of the hashrate, due to a misconception about how "Nakamoto consensus" works, they think 51% is the winner in a hardfork situation.  They don't seem to understand that 51% only determines the winner in a softfork situation or conflicting transaction situation.  BU supporters typically only want to win and become Bitcoin, rather than fork into two viable coins.


There is plenty of debate about this.  After the Milan Scaling conference many Core developers discussed these issues in the next couple of days in Milan.  The trouble is it is difficult for developers to discuss these issues in public, or people may misinterpret what they say and they may get attacked from both sides of the debate.
It seems to me many people are happy to use a poorly executed hardfork as leverage to try to get their way.  Unfortunately the other side has a very different viewpoint, that one must never hardfork in response to leverage, otherwise the integrity of the system is damaged, since the rules are not resilient against threats.

I am sorry, but I feel this it a mischarecterisation  of the debate.  Both sides want short term on chain scaling.  SegWit is short term on chain scaling.
In addition to this both sides want a larger limit on non witness data in the short term.  It is just that one side wants to ensure any hardfork is done in a safe way, while the other side has a different view of the risks of a hardfork or is happy taking greater risks.
Unfortunately both sides seem to misunderstand the position of the other, which causes a lot of the problems. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:21:48


Most work chain yes


That is how XT and Classic are configured.  Since a larger block is invalid according to Core, yet a smaller block is valid according to XT/Classic.  This gives Core an asymmetric advantage.
BU is way more complicated due to AD, but a similar principal applies

Not for me it isn't 


This is a point I have probably made over 1,000x on reddit.  This cost is lower for  larger miners.  Therefore if this cost is significant in relation to revenue, it encourages mining centralisation.


Sorry I do not understand this


No, because if mining is centralised the entire system can be censored.  Making individual transactions censorship resistant can be solved by various anonomising tools.  We also need to make the entire system resilient against being totally shut down.


From the wikipedia summary:


We cannot rely on a cartel naturally forming as that implies centralisation.  **BIP100 has a cartel like impact on transaction fees, except it is enforced by the non mining nodes, rather than just the miners.**  Its not a cartel, in that its not only a agreement between suppliers, but enforced by all nodes.  This ensures we do not require mining centralisation.  I therefore support miner voting for the limit with all nodes enforcing the vote, but oppose a cartel where the miners impose the cartel rules on each other.  A miner cartel will only be able to prevent a defection from the supply agreement if mining is centralised.
     
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:43:44


ETC vs ETH did have a checkpoint.
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:52:27


Those other costs are real costs to.  They also matter as well as storage 


Mining is therefore required to be centralised.  In my view Bitcoin is pretty useless then




I strongly agree with this.  There are technical issues and problems with the 20% thing.  Jeff is open to changing it to 50%.  This is especially important for reductions in the blocksize, that needs to be 50%, since 50% can force a blocksize limit reduction anyway, via a softfork.


I do not agree.  Why do miners voting imply they are in a cartel?


I totally agree.  Please try explaining this to BU supporters.  They are not friendly 


I agree with a lot of what you said, apart from this bit.  At some point, the limit, even a flexible one, has to "get in the way", otherwise it is pointless 
      
@_date: 2016-12-02 07:38:31


I think as a community we need to improve how we explain and articulate some of the potential problems in BU


Many people are highly frustrated about the lack of progress with respect to a hardfork in Bitcoin.  I think this is somewhat justified, although patience is also important.  BU may be a reaction to this frustration in a way you describe.
 
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:27:08


You do know 95% was used successfully 4 times in the last 18 months for  softforks right?
If the miners decide SegWit is to controversial as they do not want both effective and literal larger blocks, I respect their right not to activate it
@_date: 2016-11-15 08:44:33


I don't think anyone has a problem with that, but I do not think that is what large blockers seem to want.  They want to hardfork but they also want to take a majority of the hashpower and SPV wallets with them.


Well let's try for 95% and worry about what to do later if 95% doesn't work.  It is  better getting to say 75% first, then push for an additional 20% from a majority position, rather than start with a 75% target.  I also think we shouldn't increase capacity without support from the community, 95% is a proxy for such support.


Well to many of a hardfork occurs without consensus, in a non emergancy situation, then Bitcoin is pointless anyway as one may as well use the USD.  Therefore this position is rational.
@_date: 2016-11-27 07:07:14
Out of interest, from the current SPV wallets, do you know of any particular ones that are either compatible with or incompatible with a very basic hardfork, of just "moving a 1MB to a 2"? 
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:02:54
Perhaps it is childish, but let's not forgot actual critical vulnerabilities that exist in BU.  For example:
* **Median EB blocksize attack** - a miner only has to find one block once which has a size equal to the median EB value, to split the hashrate into two equal groups. Effectively totally grinding the system to a halt indefinitely, with just 0.7% of the hashrate, which can cause a devastating chainfork everyday.
* **The sticky gate** - whenever a blocksize limit increase occurs in BU, nodes will accept blocks of **any size** at all for 144 blocks.  
When these issues are mentioned to the BU team, all they say is "Nakamoto consensus works, therefore vulnerableilities don't exist, since if 51% of miners are honest nothing can  go wrong."  In my view this is an irresponsible attitude.  Besides, the attack vectors above require 0.7% of the hashrate to work once per day, not 51%.
        
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:18:09

@_date: 2016-11-23 04:35:14
BU is a limit which is determined by a social consensus mechanism, of miners all looking at flags, and then the node operator deciding.  This type of mechanism is not unique, not robust and does not scale.  BU is equivalent to social consensus with friends, a very inappropriate system for money at scale where disputes occur.
When BU increases the blocksize limit, there is a period where mining is split in two chains, this is a terrible idea, in my view.
Unlike Core, **BU is a closed  private members organisation**, in order to submit an improvement proposal one needs to be a member, which means you need to agree to the highly political BU articles of association and become approved by existing BU members.  It looks like a group of people who want power and control over the Bitcoin protocol.  This is in stark contrast to Core's open philosophy and idea that the existing rules prevail if there is a dispute.
@_date: 2016-11-16 07:55:06


For example people advocating running deliberately incompatible clients, like BU, before consensus is reached.


Perhaps it never goes away and we are stuck without being able to do a hardfork.  I think it is important to be patient.  However, if in 5 or 10 years time significant attacks remain, perhaps Bitcoin may not succeed as it would be stuck with limited capacity, this would be a huge shame for the project.  


I think people do not want to do this, since it may appear to be a response to the political pressure of some to do the hardfork without respecting minority rights to veto the hardfork.  If a group, even a majority, can force a hardfork through despite some people being unhappy, Bitcoin’s rules are not sufficiently resilient for it to be different enough from the USD to be interesting, in my view.
I am not claiming minority veto power over a hardfork is a "better" system than majority rules, its just an interesting idea for money, and makes Bitcoin different.  Having something different is interesting and potentially valuable.
@_date: 2016-11-30 09:18:48
This proposal was rejected by the large blockers.  That is why there is no momentum behind it.
As I keep repeating, many are reluctant to push for proposals during these "alternative ways to push the agenda forward", which are considered counterproductive.  As soon as they stop, we can begin to push hardfork proposals.  Why do you continue to ignore this point?
Remember before the XT launch all that was proposed was 20MB, a more moderate proposal, like 4MB, would easily have been accepted.  Since XT there has never been any restbite, with constant aggressive campaigns.  We are just waiting for a calm period, to hardfork. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:19:48

Great point, I couldn't agree more. Low fees are great, but anyone may be able to offer low fees.  Censorship resistance is something unique, we should not compromise significantly on something unique, for something banks may already be able to offer.
It is a shame some people may have found Bitcoin under the misconception low fees were somehow unique to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-11-29 14:26:40


Just make it clear that you won't actually do an increase until consensus is formed and the argument is over.
The people on the other side of the argument do want a blocksize increase, they just want consensus to be a condition before it happens, to avoid problems.  Apparently large blockers also want it
So let's just do it then...

This signalling may unfortunately contribute to some confusion and may be seen as circumstantial evidence of possible false flagging at a later date, by some, but at least there are no known direct victims  of this (As long as this won't turn out to be actual false flagging).  When BU and other nodes did false BIP109 signalling, they tricked actual Classic clients during an active voting period.  On the testnet BIP109 triggered and these clients were booted off the network.
@_date: 2016-12-10 13:05:22


By orphaning their blocks.  This would create a new coin and then the market can decide who is the winner.
BU, XT and Classic do not do that.  They regard the kosher chain as valid and if it takes the lead they will build on the kosher chain.
If the non kosher people really want to win, they need to temporarily  refuse to buy the kosher products.  Or the kids without a nut allergy need to go on hunger strike, until nut contaminated food is served.  This requires a high level of coordination. 
In Bitcoin, that means something like setting a checkpoint and demanding that a particular block is over 1MB, or reject it as invalid.    Then we will have two coins, and the market can decide the winner.  In my view the "large blockers" should just do this, and stop complaining.  Currently the large blockers design their upgrade mechanisms in this asymmetric way, giving their "small blocker" opponents veto power, they then complain when the veto is excersized.   It they don't like the veto, they should get rid of it.

Indeed.  Oracle and IBM have great sophisticated  database products one can use.  They even introduced dynamic  hashing of entries back in the early 1990s.  Much more flexible than the hashing of blocks Bitcoin does. 
Many details are available here:
Oracle is far simpler, cheaper, faster, higher capacity, more reliable  and even more secure, than blockchains.  Plus Oracle has the added benefit of users not needing to go on Reddit and be rude to other users.
Even if what you really want in your database is buzzwords, Oracle has you covered there to.

I do not think you can softfork more coins, from the point of view of  existing nodes, although I could be wrong.  You could create a new protocol that interprets what existing nodes consider as valid transactions as new coins, but existing nodes would not accept those coins.

A fix has only been proposed.  The developers should not encourage people to run BU until the fix has been completed.
This problem goes right to the core of BU, how to increase the blocksize.  The proposed solution is a fundamental change to how BU works.  Rather than addressing the issue directly, that having users set AD settings may not work, a complex algorithm for the AD setting is suggested, making BU too complex to evaluate. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 13:59:47

Thanks for your comments.  Have you thought much about the financial and economic impacts of the ability to do the wipe out?  In my view it could be very dangerous, as it provides an incentive to speculate and invest in the original chain with the ability to wipe out the new chain and earn large investment returns.  This may be very compelling to some traders.
@_date: 2016-12-09 09:07:02


The BU features like AD, EB, MG ect have not been used.  Sure BU may work when its new features are not being used.  My claim is that if the features are used, it will not work.

At the same time it is important to recognize Bitcoin has no sustainable competitive advantage when it comes to speed or cost of transactions, compared to centralized systems.  If Bitcoin is fast and has low fees and then becomes very popular as a result of this, centralized payment systems will respond competitively by reducing their fees and reducing the transaction times on their centralized systems.  This is a battle where Bitcoin will always be the loser.  This may be hard to hear for some people, but it is a reality of the technical limitations of distributed systems, it is just inherently slower and more costly than centralized systems.
In contrast, if Bitcoin is censorship resistant, and becomes popular because of that, there is **nothing the centralized systems can do about that to compete.**  Bitcoin will therefore be the winner.  This is a real sustainable pathway to long term success.
While I think speed and low transaction fees are important, the smart strategic long term thing to do is priorities censorship resistance over an area Bitcoin will never have a sustainable advantage.

Many of the reasons people seem to have for not supporting SegWit appear potentially political, for example to use as leverage over Core developers or to send a message of protest about the moderation policy on a web forum.  If this is the case, do you think it could be an end to the era of protocol upgrades?    
I am concerned we haven't yet reached a stage where the protocol is efficient, secure, robust or flexible enough and that if we can't upgrade any more, the long term outlook for Bitcoin may be poor.  For example I have concerns about transaction capacity.    
Even if SegWit activates there could be lot of pressure on the Core team to act fast and get needed upgrades through in a rush, as the era where upgrades are possible may end sooner than many people expected.    
@_date: 2016-11-16 07:24:40


Yes of course.  Everyone is in favor of additional blocksize limit increases in the future, after the SegWit blocksize limit increase.  However, if it is done a a hardfork this must occur with consensus across the community and without significant political pressure.  If political pressure can eliminate a rule in the system, the integrity of the system will be damaged and Bitcoin will not be useful money

Sure hardforking is possible:
* Type 1 can happen if the arguments mostly stop.  Perhaps in a few years Roger will finally give up and we can do this hardfork.  I am happy waiting, I think being patient is important 
* Type 2 has happened  (Bitcoin Clams for example) and nobody cared
* Type 3 is a really bad idea and we need to unite as a community to prevent it from happening.   Even if XT activates, Bitcoin Core and the 25% should still be able to win and wipe XT out
When you analyse the fork, you can see Bitcoin is quite resilient.  We are going through the process of proving this resilience right now.  As  you can see, a lot of people on both sides are getting very annoyed (to say the least), but as long as the type 3 hardfork attempt keeps failing, it shows Bitcoin works.

"Nakamoto consensus" is a mechanism for deciding between competing **valid** blocks.  It does not decide between competing invalid blocks.  51% of miners cannot steal your funds or create unlimited new coins, since they cannot hardfork.  If they could, holding Bitcoin may not be a sensible idea.  51% of miners can double spend their own coins or censor transactions.
When it comes to hardforks, there is no particular significance of the 51% miner level.  Believing this is a misconception 
    
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:58:21
Greg, I agree with many of your concerns about bigger blocks, in particular that fees will decline too much and then mining may not be incentivised.  Do sidechains not have a similiar problem?  If sidechains become popular, users wont need to pay fees on the main chain and mining incentivisation would be too low.
If sidechains are merge mined with bitcoin, the sidechain can have lower fees and then these users free ride on bitcoin security.  Therefore the sidechain could succeed with this advantage.

How do you know there will be exponential growth?  In the future growth could be linear or non existant, we just dont know.  Its important to be prudent in growth assumptions and not too optimistic.  If demand increases rapidly, changes can be made then, hopefully dynamic block size limits like BIP 100.  I hope bitcoin doesnt grow too quickly so the network and technology can mange ok.  For now bitcoin is still a small, niche, technical project

@_date: 2015-08-28 21:54:06
Why is it not safer to have at least N% support a change in any direction?  E.g. the 20th percentile for an increase and 80th percentile for a decrease, therefore each change has at least 80% support.  This removes some of the politics from the number.  I interpreted Jeff's proposal to mean this and then spread the idea around, but I think I was making too much of an assumption.

Dear Yuilleb
The trouble with Bitcoin is that we need consensus about political and economic issues, often in quite a specific, nuanced and complex mathematical framework and therefore any slight differences of opinion are often difficult to reconcile.
For example take interest rates in the economy, I am sure many Bitcoiners think that the government should not attempt to influence the interest rate in the economy and instead let supply and demand for credit find its own equilibrium price. This would result in a more robust and flexible system, with a more innovative economy and efficient allocation of capital, than the current manipulated interest rate environment.
However, we need to accept there are some circumstances where, unfortunately, it is necessary for the authorities to intervene in the market where property rights cannot be defined effectively and there are externalities. For example in the fishing industry I advocate government quotas in some circumstances. The ownership of fish cannot be defined due to technical limitations as the fish can swim anywhere in the sea and cannot be tracked. Therefore without quotas, individual fisherman may maximise their own profit, overfishing could occur and then there may be insufficient fish reserves to support society, the amount of fishing would be non optimal as ordinary people can no longer eat fish. Maybe this logic is uncomfortable, makes too many arrogant judgements about others, creates a justification for a privileged elite and violates peoples freedoms, but the facts might be such that we either have the quotas or never eat fish again.
Bitcoin does share some properties with this hypothetical fishing problem, the property rights of the blockchain cannot be defined for technical reasons. Nobody owns the blockchain and it is necessary for the data to be widely replicated in order for the system to remain viable. Without quotas on the blocksize, individual miners may maximise their own profit, too many transactions will be included in blocks and the blockchain will be too large for many people to store the blockchain and ordinary people can no longer fully participate in Bitcoin.
In addition to this, without a quota, the transaction fee would become too low to incentivise mining. As Meni Rosenfeld brilliantly put it:
    Suppose all the miners form a cartel. They will have no problem funding themselves; they can all agree not to include any tx that doesn't pay high fees. The users would pay this fee because they have no other choice.
    Some users will try to pay a fee lower than the cartel's threshold. One miner decides to defect from the cartel; he includes in his block all these low-fee transactions. This costs him nothing, so this is a net profit for him (he benefits).
    Seeing this, users will know that even if they don't pay the cartel's high fees, they can still get their tx included eventually. Thus, their willingness to pay high fees is lower (that is, the miner consumed their willingness). Thus, more users will try to pay low fees, and the total revenue of all miners decreases.
    But it's not just the one miner. Every miner will, individually, have an incentive to include low-fee txs. This means that even with a low fee, it's easy to get a tx to the block. Thus, no user will want to pay high fees, and the total revenue of miners will be low (this is the tragedy - for the miners, and due to the effect on network health, for all Bitcoin users).
    This is completely analogous to the classical instance of tragedy of the commons, where all herders would benefit if they all grazed just their fair share, but everyone is incentivized to defect and overgraze, depleting the resource and causing everyone to suffer.
Also, this from G Maxwell is a good explanation of the block size conservative side to the debate, with the main arguments below:
One is that the long-held argument is that security of the Bitcoin system
in the long term depends on fee income funding autonomous, anonymous,
decentralized miners profitably applying enough hash-power to make
reorganizations infeasible.
For fees to achieve this purpose, there seemingly must be an effective
scarcity of capacity.  The fact that verifying and transmitting
transactions has a cost isn't enough, because all the funds go to pay
that cost and none to the POW "artificial" cost; e.g., if verification
costs 1 then the market price for fees should converge to 1, and POW
cost will converge towards zero because they adapt to whatever is
being applied. Moreover, the transmission and verification costs can
be perfectly amortized by using large centralized pools (and efficient
differential block transmission like the "O(1)" idea) as you can verify
one time instead of N times, so to the extent that verification/bandwidth
is a non-negligible cost to miners at all, it's a strong pressure to
centralize.  You can understand this intuitively: think for example of
carbon credit cap-and-trade: the trade part doesn't work without an
actual cap; if everyone was born with a 1000 petaton carbon balance,
the market price for credits would be zero and the program couldn't hope
to share behavior. In the case of mining, we're trying to optimize the
social good of POW security. (But the analogy applies in other ways too:
increases to the chain side are largely an externality; miners enjoy the
benefits, everyone else takes the costs--either in reduced security or
higher node operating else.)
This area has been subject to a small amount of academic research
(e.g.  But
there is still much that is unclear.
The second is that when subsidy has fallen well below fees, the incentive
to move the blockchain forward goes away.  An optimal rational miner
would be best off forking off the current best block in order to capture
its fees, rather than moving the blockchain forward, until they hit
the maximum. That's where the "backlog" comment comes from, since when
there is a sufficient backlog it's better to go forward.  I'm not aware
of specific research into this subquestion; it's somewhat fuzzy because
of uncertainty about the security model. If we try to say that Bitcoin
should work even in the face of most miners being profit-maximizing
instead of altruistically-honest, we must assume the chain will not
more forward so long as a block isn't full.  In reality there is more
altruism than zero; there are public pressures; there is laziness, etc.

This is why the BIP100 vote is over 3 months.  Driving up the limit to lower fees to force out the competition, only to then lower the limit to increase fees, would be very expensive and take a long time.  I agree this period should be longer, perhaps 12 months, to mitigate this risk and the risk of similiar shenanigans.
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:36:49
Why are either of those 2 points reasons to support BIP101 over BIP100?
I disagree with some core devs for not negotiating and sticking with small block sizes, but at no point could that impact my support of BIP100.  I support what I think is best, rather than taking a more extreme position on the other side of the argument to force the opposition to give way.
In the same way, the censorship will not change my strong support for BIP100.

Dear Paul
Thanks for this interesting essay.  Please could you expand on your views the economics of Bitcoin heaters a bit more.  This is still an area which continues to confuse me, to some extent.
Let’s assume that the marginal cost of heating your home is $10 per day.  The marginal benefit of heating the home is zero in the summer and then gradually increases, peaking at $50 in the middle of the winter.  One only turns the heater on for periods in the winter when the marginal benefit is greater than $10 per day.
Let’s then assume that you make a one off capital investment and convert the heating system into a Bitcoin mining heating system.  Let us also assume the heater is “100% energy efficient”, this is probably a reasonable assumption, as in theory all the energy is ultimately is given off as heat (We will ignore factors such particles changing structure).  The system still costs $10 a day, has two settings (on and off) and is expected to mine $1 worth of bitcoin per day when switched on.  The benefit curve over time, of heating the house remains unchanged.
With this new heating system, it is now switched on for a slightly longer period, which is when the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost, now only $9 per day ($10 minus $1), compared to $10 per day for the old non Bitcoin mining system.  During this $9 to $10 range, there is a small marginal cost of mining Bitcoin.  Once the benefit of heating increases above $10, the marginal cost of mining bitcoin could be considered as zero.  Is this a reasonable way of looking at it or should the cost be split between the benefits of a warmer house and the bitcoin, pro rata according to benefits?  If the marginal cost of mining is zero, does this have any impact on mining economics?  
The resulting economics could ultimately depend on the comparative size between global Bitcoin mining revenue and global surplus heating benefits, admittedly both of these change unpredictably and dynamically over time.  If surplus global heating benefits are significantly higher than Bitcoin mining revenue (probably likely), then there could be a small number of dedicated commercial miners and most of the miners could mine bitcoin with a zero marginal cost.  This could be a security risk, since there is limited marginal cost involved and the benefits to each miner could be minimal, miners could be less interested in the security of the network and could allow various vulnerabilities to be exploited.  
For example, in the above scenario, in any given day, if the heater has a $50 benefit of a warmer house, generates $1 worth of bitcoin and costs $10 in electricity expense, bitcoin only represents 1/41 of the net benefit of turning the mining equipment on and the miner may not care sufficiently about Bitcoin security. 
Please let me know your thoughts.

BIP100 can create a price that would occur as if there was a cartel.  An actual cartel could be avoided with BIP100.  Under BIP101, its likely that only an actual cartel would work, which is very dangerous.

Raising the 21m limit may not be as damaging as BitcoinXT.  The 21m limit could be increased in a soft fork, which could be ok, as all nodes and miners, whatever their stance on the 21m issue, could still work on the same chain, they would just have a different interpretation of the number of coins.

Couldn't agree more with this.  I think its still game theory.  Mike is pushing for an extreme position to get a compromise more towards his end of the spectrum.  He may not actually believes specifying an 8GB block limit now is a good idea.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:31:09
Yes, I do know why fees are not zero now, despite blocks not being full.  That is another great question.  It is for the following four reasons:
1. Orphan risk costs are high, however in the long term these may fall due to bandwidth improvements and other technology like IBLT.
2. Mining is not competitive enough.  There are currently a few large pools, however if Bitcoin is to succeed in the long term, there needs to be many miners and a high level of competition.
3. Miners are not mature businesses yet.  Miners are often pro bitcoin people or bitcoin speculators, miners often care about the health of bitcoin.  In the long term they may be more focused on margins and profit.
4. The block reward is high, therefore miners dont worry much about fee income as it is small relative to revenue.  The block reward will fall in the long term and miners will therefore focus on maximising fee income.
As you can see, if Bitcoin is to succeed, each reason will gradually become less important over time.
With BIP100, if miners think higher volume will not reduce average fees, they will vote for bigger blocks.  Over time miners will become better at voting.

I would rather steady long term growth.  Yes, I would prefer a country to go elsewhere.  Do you really think the network is ready for a country to come onboard?
Of course it would be good if Bitcoin could scale faster, increasing one number isnt a magic solution to scalling.
Think of the following example.  What if a music festival was in a small field and 1,000 tickets went on sale, 400 of which were sold.  Some people who enjoy the festival start saying it needs to scale, management are asked to increase the ticket limit to 8,000,000.  What if the whole country want to attend the festival?  
Just increasing the limit is not scalling.  Scalling would be about transport infrastructure, getting more land, fences, licenses, more artists, improving ticketing infrastructure, financing, marketing, hiring more staff, security teams, medical staff, more safety experts, more food, ect...  Planing for the whole country to attend is unrealistic, that would require many decades of hard work and actual scalling.
@_date: 2015-08-26 21:02:27
Well I think the voting period has not formally been decided yet.  I would favour a longer voting period, which would ensure more conservative gradual change and make the system less vulnerable to attacks.  It would also ensure miners consider the long term health of the network and vote less on selfish short term considerations.  I propose a 1 year voting period.

In the catastrophic scenario where full node operators, users, merchants, exchanges and investors are split on the 21m issue, then yes, miners will meed to decide.  Please note this is a hypothetical scenario, currently there is consensus over 21m.
The mining network is Bitcoin's consensus mechanism, for determining the one true chain.  When all else fails, we may need to use Bitcoin's internal consensus system to reach consensus about something else, about the rules.  Its either that or the system fails.  The economic majority method may seem better, but we need a fail safe system in case that fails.

The great thing about BIP 100 is that miners vote over the long term as a group to protect industry wide revenue.  The tragedy of the commons type situation where miners make big blocks for short term profit shouldnt impact this vote.  Miners will not always vote for bigger blocks, miners vote to maximise mining revenue.
Mining revenue = bitcoin price * transaction volume * average fee.  This is why BIP100 is a brilliant balance between these three parameters.

This is not like miner voting.  Miner voting is better than this.  Under these median + x% ideas each miner could benefit by making a larger block and getting higher fees in that block.  All miners could do this and this could then cause the limit to increase at the wrong time.  
With voting each miner does not individually benefit from their own vote, therefore the vote is made to benefit bitcoin as a whole, this avoids tradgedy of the commons problem above.  More specifically, miners vote to maximise:
industry revenue = exchange rate * volume * average fee
Many people want these things maximised, therefore BIP100 &gt; &gt; the unresponsive median + x% idea.

Indeed, Bitcoin wont last forever as a distributed system.  Its merely a question of how long it lasts.  This still doesnt mean we are wasting our time.
There are many technical reasons for a limit.  Is slower block propogation not technical?  Also technical and economic issues are deeply integrated and cannot be split.  Even if all the reasons were all economic, that doesnt mean we should get rid of the cap.

Unsurprisingly , I do not think your assertion that I have “misunderstandings over how bitcoin works on a fundamental level” is completely true, however I do understand why you say this.  Analysing how the network can reach consensus over a change in the rules can be looked at from many different angles and under some of these angles the comment you made makes complete sense, consider the following assertions:
* **Claim A - Miners -**
*The Bitcoin mining network wholly determines the rules in the network, because miners determine the most work chain and the chain with the most work is most valid.*
* **Claim B - Full Node Operators -**
Claim A is false, it doesn’t matter which chain miners work on, full nodes will never accept an invalid chain, therefore it is the full nodes which determine the consensus rules.
* **Claim C - Investors -**
*Claim B is false, it does not matter which chain has more full nodes, the Bitcoin network can manage with only a fraction of the nodes anyway since there is large amount of redundancy in the amount of nodes.  Miners don’t mine for fun, they mine for profit and the ability to sell the bitcoin they make, therefore it is investors which determine the rules, as miners will mine on the chain with the highest value.*
* **Claim D - Merchants &amp; Companies -**
*Claim C is false, because fundamentally investors are only speculating about fundamental demand for bitcoin, therefore it is merchants and companies in the ecosystem which determine which version has the higher value, as demand is driven be potential use of bitcoin.*
* **Claim E - Users -**
*Claim D is false, because merchants and businesses ultimately cater for their customers, at the end of the day it is users who determine real demand and therefore the one valid chain.*
As you can see all of the claim above can be seen as valid, however the reality is there is a complex and nuanced relationship between them and none of the claims are completely true.  Actually time plays a huge part in this, in the short term Claim A is most significant and over longer time periods the other factors begin to come into play, with Claim E only becoming relevant over a longer more sustained battle over the consensus rules.  Another point of interest is how the expected block time will vary depending on the split of the mining network, until difficulty adjusts.
The reason I think mining could prove to be quite significant is because of its convergent property.  Once miners make a decision and a one chain is longer, it may be relatively difficult for the mining network to change its mind.  This could be very crucial as miners need to make a decision as soon as the fork occurs, they literally cause the fork.  By contrast:
* **B** - Running a full node can be quite easy and these can shift from chain to chain, infact many people may run multiple nodes on different chains.
* **C** – Investors can change there mind, one chain could have a higher market capitalization and then this could swing around, remember for every buyer there is a seller.
* **D** – Merchants and companies can also change their mind, or simply step back and shut down during the disruption.
* **E** – Users can also be very fickle.

Rethink the confrontational idea that there is a competition for power/control between developers and miners.
The whole point of Bitcoin is that nobody is in control of the rules, neither developers nor miners...
You said:


This implies that the forces are coming to a head and we will find out the winner.  Now that SegWit2x has been abandoned you might draw the wrong conclusion.  You might now think that developers are the winner and are the most powerful force.
That is totally the wrong lesson to learn.  Neither developers not miners can do a hardfork.  Nobody controls the system.  That is the lesson to learn.
Had Core tried to do a hardfork like SegWit2x, they would also have failed.  This issue has nothing to do with **who** was behind SegWit2x.  This misunderstanding and misconception is driving the community apart.

It would create market driven dynamic block size limits
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:38:56
Ok lets contrast BIP100 with the blocksize limit is the median of the last x blocks plus y% rule, for example.  In the median rule case each miner may try to maximise there own revenue by including more lower fee transactions in blocks, at the expense of the industry as a whole.  Median block sizes therefore increase and the limit will increase.  Industry wide fees decline and the equilibrium difficulty may be too low.  BIP100 is superior to this, as although each miner votes, the impact of the vote effects the whole industry, a miner can not individually profit from their own vote for bigger blocks.
Do you see how BIP100 may address this tragedy of the commons type problem?

The BIP says:
"Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top

I agree that this is not clear.  I agree with you and that in your example 4MB should remain as the limit, and it should not fall to 3MB.
My understanding is that 4MB would be the most common floor.  The word "minimum" in this case may mean that the limit can not increase unless 80% of votes support it.  Although I could be wrong.  If I am wrong then I think BIP100 should be changed.

I think many amateur miners is fine, as long as they mine for profit and not some other reason, like heating or toasters.
I think your example of a security patch is really good.  The economics of the theoretical 21 inc mining toaster really fasinate me.  It may be a nice way of lowering the cost of turning bread into toast or leaving the toaster always on in some cases, getting more utility from faster toast.  However if you know the toaster has been hacked and will try to attack Bitcoin, but a guest comes over and requests toast, you would probably use the toaster and therefore attack Bitcoin to keep your guest happy, before applying a patch.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:26:21
I do not think the cap is a magic bullet that can reduce mining centralisation that much, there are other reasons for the cap I mentioned.  However a cap will help.
In the short term the cap will help, as larger blocks could help miners clusterd together, because propagation times will increase for miners away from the cluster.  In the longer term the cap could reduce the incentives for a mining cartel as fees could be driven by supply and demand.  Without a cap a cartel may be needed to restrict supply, this will be hard to run unless mining is centralised.
Mining centralisation is a large problem today, but it is improving.
In 2009 there was basically one miner.
In 2010 there were at most 5 miners
In 2011 one pool, deepbit had a majority of the power.
In 2014 one pool, Ghash, came close to a majority
Hopefully in the future it will improve more.  The improvement could be driven by better internet connections, IBLT, slower ASIC upgrade cycle, more competitive energy markets and higher proportional cost of cooling larger areas.

If the seller of a stock has no significant economic benefit of holding it, the price will go down to low levels.  Stock holders hold on to it for dividends of expectations of selling it at a later point.  If these two things are economically insignificant the price will be zero.
Miners have no significant economic costs of adding a transaction to a block.  In the short term there are orphan costs, but in the long term these costs will significantly fall as a proportion of revenue due to technological improvements.  Therefore the price will fall to low levels.
I wish the market for transaction fees was like a normal market, but it is not.  There is a misalignment in the market.  Users pay for their transactions to be included in blocks.  Miners exists for security reasons, to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.  These are two different consepts.  A blocksize limit is required to reconcile this difference.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:12:03
I think miners are the single most important constituent group in determining this.
Analysing how the network can reach consensus over a change in the rules can be looked at from many different angles, consider the following assertions:
• Claim A - Miners - The Bitcoin mining network wholly determines the rules in the network, because miners determine the most work chain and the chain with the most work is most valid.
• Claim B - Full Node Operators - Claim A is false, it doesn’t matter which chain miners work on, full nodes will never accept an invalid chain, therefore it is the full nodes which determine the consensus rules.
• Claim C - Investors - Claim B is false, it does not matter which chain has more full nodes, the Bitcoin network can manage with only a fraction of the nodes anyway since there is large amount of redundancy in the amount of nodes. Miners don’t mine for fun, they mine for profit and the ability to sell the bitcoin they make, therefore it is investors which determine the rules, as miners will mine on the chain with the highest value.
• Claim D - Merchants &amp; Companies - Claim C is false, because fundamentally investors are only speculating about fundamental demand for bitcoin, therefore it is merchants and companies in the ecosystem which determine which version has the higher value, as demand is driven be potential use of bitcoin.
• Claim E - Users - Claim D is false, because merchants and businesses ultimately cater for their customers, at the end of the day it is users who determine real demand and therefore the one valid chain.
As you can see all of the claims above can be seen as valid, however the reality is there is a complex and nuanced relationship between them and none of the claims are completely true. Actually time plays a huge part in this, in the short term Claim A is most significant and over longer time periods the other factors begin to come into play, with Claim E only becoming relevant over a longer more sustained battle over the consensus rules.

That is why the transaction fee market is important.  Let the market decide what is economically valuable enough to get into the blockchain.  A higher price should be indirectly considerd a good thing, as it indicates more demand and more uses of bitcoin.

Why not remove the 8GB part of the proposal then?  I have told Gavin if he does this I may support a one off move to 8MB.
A well funded malicious attacker could have a similiar impact on the memepool with 8MB blocks than with 1MB blocks.  The main difference would be that more of the damage would end up on the blockchain.  For example, on chain spam is currently capped at 1MB.  I dont want to host 8MB of spam every 10 minutes with my nodes right now, sorry.

I thought Gavin favoured the IETF model.
Working groups make decisions through a "rough consensus" process. IETF consensus does not require that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the working group shall prevail. (However, "dominance" is not to be determined on the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any other means on which the WG agrees (by rough consensus, of course). Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as "rough consensus" and 99% is better than rough. It is up to the Chair to determine if rough consensus has been reached (IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures).

@_date: 2015-08-29 18:25:55
Please let me explain three points on the idea that orphan risk could create a marginal cost of adding transactions, which could finance mining: 
 * Some have argued (Gregory Maxwell^1) that if the only significant marginal costs of including a transaction is the orphan risk, then equilibrium difficulty will be too low.  The reason is because average transaction fees will be equal to the marginal orphan risk increase and therefore there is no additional revenue to subsidies the cost of hashing. Therefore the equilibrium difficulty will be too low and we have a problem.  I am not sure if this is correct because the marginal cost of orphan risk will be unique to each miner, therefore one could draw an industry marginal orphan risk cost curve and some miners would make more profits than others, this dynamic could be sufficient to ensure high enough equilibrium difficulty.  Although it implies better connected miners are more profitable and therefore may increase centralization.  Although this does make this idea significantly superior to the ideas about arbitrarily fining miners a uniform amount for larger blocks, because this cost is the same for all miners there will be no cost curve and therefore no cross subsidy for hashing, which will result in equilibrium difficulty being too low. 
 * Gavin and others have argued that computer science has come a long way in the last 20 years.  For example bandwidth speeds and increased and storage costs have come down.  This is often cited as a reason supporting BIP101, because transferring 8GB is expected to be much cheaper in 20 years time.  I broadly agree with this line of thought.  However ironically this makes me more concerned about BIP101, because these technological improvements may mean the marginal cost of orphan risk, when including an additional transaction into a block, will get closer to zero over time or at least become insignificant.  Therefore I consider this point a large negative when evaluating the viability of a fee market without a blocksize limit.
 * I am also concerned about using orphan risk as the mechanism for ensuring a fee market.  Operating this way may imply the orphan risk will constantly be pushed to the limit.  This is not good for the health of the network and reduces the ability of the network to effectively and decisively come to consensus about the state of the blockchain.  I also consider this point a negative when evaluating the viability of a fee market without a blocksize limit.
*1 - The fact that verifying and transmitting transactions has a cost isn't enough, because all the funds go to pay that cost and none to the POW "artificial" cost. -

@_date: 2015-08-26 22:52:29
Great question.
For example, a miner may prefer smaller blocks so that fees are higher. i.e. the miner thinks the negative impact from a reduction in volume would be smaller than the positive impact of a fee increase from the smaller blocks.  Therefore the miner wants smaller blocks.
However, the miner makes a large block anyway to benefit from larger fees in the short term, from that block, in the hope other miners make smaller blocks.   This plan will fail because each miner will also operate in their own selfish interest and make larger blocks.  Fees then downwardly spiral to zero and network security falls. 
This is happening in the oil market right now, loss making oil companys are pumping more and more oil to get cash in the short term and the oil price keeps falling.  Oil firms then get more desperate for short term cash.  Each oil company hopes other firms will reduce production so the price increases, but the nash equilibrium is for each oil producer to keep pumping.  We must not allow this race to the bottom to occur in bitcoin mining.  Lets learn the lesson from oil production and the mining of other commodities.
For oil of course this does not matter, eventually oil firms go bankrupt and shut down, then supply falls and the oil price rises.  This correction can not occur in bitcoin because supply does not correct.  Bitcoin miners keep the network secure, they do not supply capacity.  One remaining miner can provide all the capacity we need, but not the security.  Due to this imbalance, a blocksize limit is required.

Scarcity is required to create a viable market resulting in fees, which are required to incentivise miners.

I see XT as a dangerous fork that could lead to a catastrophic event.  I am conservative on the block size, but this is a moot point now, consensus is all that matters.
SPV clients will use the longest chain.  I will use Bitcoin Core, however if XT gets a large lead I will consider switching.  I dont want to be on a chain with lower difficulty, because it could be vulnerable.  I also state this position publically to help ensure the most work chain plays a key part in consensus.  Mining is a highly convergent process, we should accsept the most work chain to help maintain consensus.  A wider forking war with investors, exchanges, merchants ect entering the debate could be more catastrophic, with no clear winner.  Miners always have a clear winner.
Lets agree to support the most work chain in this case.

Ok thats a good point, sorry I was not clear.  Although of course if Bitcoin is useful and block propagation costs become low enough (a positive thing), then its safe to assume all blocks are full.  Why would users or attackers not just use up all the space if it costs nothing?  (If propagation costs become low, which is desirable, there will only be a fee if the cap "comes into play", implying full blocks)

I explained in this thread.
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:04:57
BIP100 is like a cartel for price fixing in some ways.  What BIP100 does is allow the price to be fixed as if a cartel like structure existed, but actually have many competing miners.  This is why BIP100 is quite clever.  It is ironic like Bitcoin in a way.  Bitcoin is about achieving abosolute order, while at the time ensuring everyone has freedom to do what they want.  BIP100 has cartel like pricing, but with many members who have freedom to do what they want.
Without BIP100, the only way for price fixing to occur is if there was a very small group of miners who controlled the network, like you said.  BIP100 would not be needed then and the price would be fixed.  Without BIP100, if there were too many miners the cartel would fall apart, as members would defect from the cartel. 
BIP100 kind of provides a framework for a cartel like structure to apply, but with many competing members.  As Meni pointed out when BIP100 was released, under many assumptions as to what bitcoin is for, this may mean volumes are too low or suboptimal.  I still think BIP100 is the best proposal out there, although its far from perfect.
A small percentile range of the previous maximum is vague and its not clear how it relates to demand.

@_date: 2015-07-08 21:00:26
I agree that that is very high, and we should probably patiently discuss blocksize increases at that point.  I agree with you, I want fees to be low.
However, from the point of view of monitoring network data, I wish fees were that high though, because it would indicate Bitcoin is extremely successful, useful and popular, causing high demand for using the blockchain.  This would be an indication of success.
For example, if we start a business making a new type of shoe and we have a grand vision of everyone in the world getting them for just $2, thats great.  However if in the first few years we have production capacity issues and cant supply everyone and prices go to $500, that is fine.  The high price shows we are successful and there is demand.  In the long run, we still aim to address our capacity problems and make cheap shoes for all.

Increasing the block size limit will make  more of the spam end up on chain, with lower fees.  How does that help?
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:00:46
If they dont lower the limit then how do the miners benefit by getting higher fees?  What would be the purpose of driving out competition?
Under BIP100 miners may vote for a lower limit if fees are to low, this would be to ensure their revenue increases.  Miners vote for the optimal size.
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:35:32
How will those costs be important?  Validation costs are very low.  My RPi validates everything and it cost me £10.  Orphan costs should also fall as IBLT and assosiated technologies become more widely used.  By the way if these other costs like orphan risks are too large, mining will be centralised.
With no blocksize limit, supply is effectivly infinite and the marginal cost of production is insignificant.  That does not result in a functioning market.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:16:30
I kind of agree with you.  The point I am trying to make is that IF other elements in the economic consensus process fail, then rule by miners is the reality.  Miners are the ultimate backup in the consensus process, because the mining network will reach a consensus no matter what.  The rest of the ecosystem will then need to rally behind this if it is to survive.  As you know, without consensus Bitcoin is nothing.

The framework for this MR, MC type analysis is for evaluating decisions.  If a wealthy family is freezing in the winter, they will turn the heating on.  The tiny additional bitcoin profit may not factor into the decision, because its a complete no brainer anyway.  When we evaluate the Bitcoin network, might it not be appropriate to consider MC = 0, in this type of case as the temperature crosses a threshold?
I guess technically the marginal cost would be the additional cost of the next hash, and my argument is a kind of technical way around this.
Currently Bitcoin mining is dedicated to one task.  If Bitcoin mining economics and costs become integrated with another larger purpose (heating), there may not necessarly be a dedicated special interest managing the mining which adhers to the Bitcoin security assumptions.

Why should we assume bitcoin will keep growing and growing? No system in history only grows, there will be periods of growth and periods of decline, like any other system, its great that BIP100 has the flexibility to allow for this.
Miners will vote to maximise their revenue: 
Mining revenue = the economic value of network security = bitcoin fx rate * transaction volume * average fee.
BIP100 is great as its a balanced, dynamic and market driven compromise, which maximises the product of these three important metrics.  Many people are arguing about the relative importance of these three metrics, BIP100 could be the long term solution to this we are after.
BIP100 enables capacity to adjust to meet demand, this is better than estimating what demand will look like now for the next 20+ years, which is very difficult for anybody to do.

This average proposal is worse than BIP100, as miners would each individually benefit from including more transactions at the expense of bitcoin as a whole.

Under BIP100 miners do not individually benefit from their vote for larger blocks, instead the ecosystem as a whole will benefit and miners get their fair share of the benefit.

Bitcoin is new and has only really been used in a very niche way by geeks. In the future, Bitcoin may continue to grow and more people will find it useful, as it matures it moves out of the very niche environment and begins to have actual uses. This could be as a payment network, proof of existence, some kind of game, who knows... I think its reasonable to assume the following:
Bitcoin is successful =&gt; Bitcoin has utility =&gt; there is demand to use Bitcoin, such that if fees are too low demand is very high, equivalent to infinity
This is similar to the following:
iPhones are successful =&gt; iPhone has utility that consumers like =&gt; there is demand for iPhone, such that if fees are too low demand is very high, equivalent to infinity
Once bitcoin becomes a more normal economic good, we need fees to restrict usage, otherwise usage will approach infinity.  Just like Apple can't give all the iPhones away for free.
Please note:
I am not making a value judgement about the level of the fee. Perhaps the current fee could be 0.1 cent, who knows.  I merely assert that **a** fee is crucial to the operation of the network.
On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails, has no utility and no real economic demand, then fine increase the blocksize limit and blocks may not fill up.

This basic writeup is quite good:
However the issue is complicated and making this decision is not easy.  The writeup above definitely does not contain ALL of the arguments, no such place exists.  BIP 100 also has a very good writeup.
We need to carefully read opinions of people from both sides.  I think its also important not to decide in a rush, we may need to carefully consider the way forward over a reasonable period of time and perhaps wait for more detailed evidence based acedemic work.

Why is the dSHA2 comment not  partly correct?  Meni's 2011 economic majority comment is very clever, but how relevant it might be is another question.  Once the first block over 1MB is published who knows what will happen, it could be complete luck who wins.
1. If version 4 is accsepted by 75% of the miners they could be too chicken to publish a 1.1MB block.
2. If the first 1.1MB block is published, what happens if its orphaned? Even by luck?
This debate could be decided by miners in 20 minutes with luck playing a huge part.  
In my view miners are THE single most important part of the "economic majority".  The other parts like investors can change their mind more easily.

Please just be a bit more patient and withdraw the "fire" from the arses of the core devs so they can calmy work on a solution over the long term.  Would you work with fire in your arse? Why is there such a rush?  If it takes 10 years I will be happy.  I actually think BIP 100 is the clever dynamic solution we need.  It just takes time to analyse.  In addition to this huge progress has already been made, signature verification is now much faster, for instance.

If fees are increasing that is because there is more demand.  Your argument seems to be:
More users -&gt; higher fees -&gt; fewer users.
That is an illogical process.  If demand falls then so will the fees. 
Instead of rushing ahead with 8GB blocks, lets try to patiently and respectivly discuss the issue and compromise on more moderate increases.  I favour BIP 100.

With the right measures in place, if miners use the first seen principle 0 conformation transactions can be used in some circumstances. This is not perfect but should be fine in many cases if the right steps are taken.
Steps merchants could take when accsepting zero conf payments:
1. Low maximum transaction value
2. Trusted/known/registerd customers only
3. ID required
4. Use a well connected node and wait 5 seconds to test for conflicting transactions
5. Install security cameras
6. Payment channels
7. Green address multisig idea
8. Reversible merchandise only. E.g. subscriptions, tickets, rent, even a house sale ect
9. Communication channel with miners

Increasing the blocksize makes this worse.  Good point.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:36:45
I dont think the limit has helped with respect to the issue in the past.  Actually the limit is likely to have had no impact since it has not really even been used, with demand below 1MB per block in the past.  It could help in the future compared to the counterfactual of larger blocks, but that doesnt mean the situation gets any better in absolute terms.
Yes many of the reasons for the cap are theoretical/economic.  The same is true for many parts of the network including the currency or unit bitcoin, why do we have the currency? To theoretically economically incentivise miners.  Bitcoin is based on theoretical economic incentives.

Different people have had different visions for this technology for years.  One thing I think all the core devs agree on is that Bitcoin should become a high volume low cost of transaction system.  The difference of view, is how to get there and the time frame.  Security needs to take priority and we have no need to rush.  Please be patient.  In the long term waiting a few more years for better scalability makes no difference.

Three weeks after this comment, I was wondering if you may be willing to rethink the above.  Please try and understand its individual end user sovereignty that matters.  We must end this destructive nonsense of a batter between developers and miners for control/power.
Users verify the rules for their own funds and are the ones in control, if not the system is entirely pointless.  Miners, businesses and developers should respect that and stop fighting it.
@_date: 2015-07-09 07:00:44
As Meni Rosenfeld brilliantly put it:
Suppose all the miners form a cartel. They will have no problem funding themselves; they can all agree not to include any tx that doesn't pay high fees. The users would pay this fee because they have no other choice.
Some users will try to pay a fee lower than the cartel's threshold. One miner decides to defect from the cartel; he includes in his block all these low-fee transactions. This costs him nothing, so this is a net profit for him (he benefits).
Seeing this, users will know that even if they don't pay the cartel's high fees, they can still get their tx included eventually. Thus, their willingness to pay high fees is lower (that is, the miner consumed their willingness). Thus, more users will try to pay low fees, and the total revenue of all miners decreases.
But it's not just the one miner. Every miner will, individually, have an incentive to include low-fee txs. This means that even with a low fee, it's easy to get a tx to the block. Thus, no user will want to pay high fees, and the total revenue of miners will be low (this is the tragedy - for the miners, and due to the effect on network health, for all Bitcoin users).
This is completely analogous to the classical instance of tragedy of the commons, where all herders would benefit if they all grazed just their fair share, but everyone is incentivized to defect and overgraze, depleting the resource and causing everyone to suffer.

Blockstream is a new company and was founded years after Greg made his views about blocksize clear and it will not benefit if Bitcoin is crippled.  Both sidechains and lightning benefit from a better Bitcoin, with more adoption, value and capacity.
I haver never questioned Gavin or Mike's integrity and it would be crazy of me to do so.  This is a genuine disagreement.  Peter Todd, Gavin, Wlad, Greg, Mike, Adam, Jeff and Pieter all have Bitcoins best interests at heart.  These attacks on integrity serve no purpose.

Yes, as I said BIP100 is not perfect, but its the best proposal we have.
It also matters what the objective of the system is, if its to maximize utility for users, then BIP100 may have a suboptimal blocksize limit.  If it is to maximise network security, then BIP100 may be optimal.

EB/AD is not a sensible idea. With nodes setting their own consensus rules, there is no reason to suppose they will converge on one chain.  Of course nodes COULD all set the same EB, but then the EB mechanism is pointless anyway…  Either there are chainsplits or the EB system is pointless.
Anyway this EB mechanism can be trivially broken by a miner deliberately mining a block the size of the median EB value, splitting the network into two.  There is even the “ironic median EB attack”, when a miner can exploit the sticky gate rule and do a median EB attack when larger block nodes are on the smaller block chain and smaller block nodes are on the larger block chain.  This is so laughably stupid, one could barely make up a more stupid protocol idea if one tried.
Then there is the AD mechanism.  This is very dangerous and pointless parameter that dramatically undermines confirmations.  The recommended AD setting is officially 12.  Would you accept an incoming transaction with 10 confirmations, knowing there might be one more block found on an alternative chain (already in the lead with 11 confirmations) that you do not know about, which could orphan all 11 of these blocks?  AD effectively totally undermines the whole idea of a confirmation and thus the entire system

Great point Opec is a cartel.  The impact of Opec is weakening right now and oil prices are faĺling.  Oil producers are failing and may go under.  **We cannot allow this to happen in Bitcoin because unlike oil, the market cant correct.**  If miners start failing the supply of space in blocks does not fall.  This is the economic reason a block size limit is necessary.  I have tried for years to explain this.
Under BIP101 miners may need to form a cartel and orphan larger blocks to remain solvent.  This is why BIP100 is clever, cartel like prices can occur without an actual cartel.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:56:12
Great post. 
There is a difference between BIP100 requiring 80% to reduce the limit and a cartel of 51% orphaning blocks that are too big.  Under BIP100 there is less incentive for each miner to defect from the group.  With the 51% smaller block cartel, the risk is the cartel cannot be controlled and the incentive is for each miner as an individual is to defect and build on larger blocks.  I think in a healthy mining industry this cartel will fail.
@_date: 2015-07-18 20:37:59
Thanks for your comments and sorry about the delay in responding, I was traveling.
I appreciate your view and I am not saying you are wrong, you could be totally correct.  The limit may not help with the economics of the system.  However I disagree in your claim that this is trivial.  Bitcoin is both an extremely ambitious and extremely complicated project.  There are many unknowns about incentives and different assumptions people have had which have built up over years.
For example, with respect to the size of the mempool I think this is actually a desirable property for it to never be empty, for the following reasons:
* It is much better for spam to be in the mempool (temporary issue) than the blockchain (permanent issue)
* When the block reward drops to low levels, if there is an empty mempool there is no reason for miners to move forward and increase the number of confirmations.  Miners would instead be incentivized to orphan blocks.
* A large mempool means there is a larger level of demand for Bitcoin and users need to bid higher fees to get included in the chain. This is a market based approach ensuring users with more utility from their transaction get onto the chain whilst some less economically significant transactions are not included.  We cannot let an infinite number of transactions on the chain, as the recent spam attack shows anyone could fill it all up with crap.
I completely deny that I  want to limit the growth of Bitcoin to move into secondary systems.  For the record I have doubts over how sidechains can work and think they can mess with mining incentives on the main chain.  If a two way pegged sidechain is merge mined then can't users free ride on Bitcoin secuirty by using the sidechain, resulting in the classic free rider problem?  I want Bitcoin to succeed and grow, however I recognize that progress will not be in a straight line and its important to get the long term incentives right, rather than rushing ahead with apparently trivial fixes.  If the solutions take many years to develop we should be patient and wait.
If you are still concerned about these issues please PM me and I would be happy to meet in person.  I assume you are much more polite in real life.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:16:17
Why should it take priority?  Blocks being full is not a negative issue.  If Bitcoin is successful blocks should be full whatever the limit.  Non full blocks and an empty mempool is a negative issue for me.

This is both a security risk and a philosophical difference.  This proposal represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the protocol.  The core protocol cannot reference external data like an FX rate API.  
Which API will be chosen?
What happens if the API goes down or is hacked?
What happens if the API has errors?
What happens if different nodes get different readings from the API?  
This approach is inconsistent with everything else in the protocol and defeats the whole objective of Bitcoin.

Make costs higher for the spammer to do what?  
If a spammer wants to increase the UTXO size 8MB blocks will make this far cheaper. 
If a spammer wants to flood the memepool, the price of that might not even change.  The fees the spammer would need to pay on the spam transactions would fall.

For example if demand for using Bitcoin declines over a period of a few years.
If you dont see how it might need to fall, why even have a max limit?
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:11:54
BIP100 does reflect adoption/demand. If demand increases the price elasticity of demand may fall, therefore miners may vote to increase the limit.  Miners vote to maximise their revenue and they therefore need to evaulate the price elasticity of demand when they vote.
The previous blocksize method may result in a limit that is too large as miners include more transactions to selfishly earn more revenue for themselves at the expense of the network as a whole.
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:08:39
Of course succeed and scale.
Neither of these things will be easy and neither have simple quick solutions.  Increasing the block size limit will eventually be part of scalling, I think everyone at Blockstream agrees with this. Lets just try not to rush the discussion over how, when and by how much.

Outbidding everyone is an extremely expensive attack vector.  Investing billions in mining hardware or buying everyones coins are also expensive attacks.  I think its unlikely anyone will try these as there are cheaper ways of causing problems.  
If this occurs, and fees are increasing to very high levels, we can raise the blocksize limit then.
Also I accsept you make a good point here.

No, i do not think either are ok.  But I do not know.  That is why Theymos was asked.
Maybe its not a black and white issue.  It depends on several factors.  XT for example was particularly dangerous and several factors combined make it very dangerous and suitable for a promotion ban.  For example:
* Guaranteed 75% vs 25% split
* No wipeout protection
* No replay protection
* General hostile way it was promoted


No reason this needs to be a softfork.  This can be done without a soft or hard fork, and is therefore not that interesting

I do not think the "above demand" part of the question makes sense.  Typically people talk in terms of a demand curve, where as the price tends to zero demand tends to infinity,  therefore the concept of supply being "above demand" is flawed.  Normally we have an equilibrium where supply/capacity equals demand.
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:54:48
No! I never said I favour 1MB blocks forever!! Personally I support BIP 100.  I am opposed to a contentious hard fork, locking in 8GB blocks, at this point.  My position is moderate.  I have told Gavin I may support a one off move to 8MB.
Hashing is an economically resource intensive process.  The other costs you mention will be insignificant compared to this and irrelevant in the long run.  Also as we saw last Saturday, most miners dont even bother to validate.  Validation is a network cost on all nodes and not miner specific.
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:52:12


What about a statement from Core that it will propose a potential hardfork blocksize increase to the community and then let the community discuss the issue over several months?  Core will then make a value judgment on whether the community is happy and decide if the level of contention is insignificant.  If this occurs, then Core will implement a hardfork in the code, with a large activation threshold of over 95% and a long grace period of over six months.

A **hashrate minority** softfork is **safer** if its impossible to create an invalid block using the old client

* Firstly this is not an optimization.  This trick reduces the amount of work a miner needs to do, rather than making the work more efficient.
* Secondly this technique is patented.  Therefore there is a risk that the patent holder could have too much control over the network, we should therefore change the protocol to ensure this technique does not work
* The key point here is that SegWit would prevent this covert mining shortcut.  This means the motivation to stop SegWit has been a secret and selfish reason all along and the reasons put forward were made with malicious intent.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:21:14
Why does this address my point?  Please can you actually address my points I have been making. 


Personally, I am and always have been a large blocker and I want 2MB blocks (or more (my personal preference is a market driven dynamic limit like BIP100)), however if miners decide to stick with 1MB then I am fine with that too, we need to respect people's rights to keep blocks small if they want.  Its a bit disappointing, but at least the small blockers will be happy and we can test out more fee pressure and make the system more resilient against spam attacks
What I find frustrating is misinformation about SegWit.  Such as people like you indirectly implying its not 2MB.  Perhaps that is confusing miners.
@_date: 2016-02-04 01:58:38
 &gt; Interfering with economics means that bitcoin has already failed. If bitcoin is subject to political influence then it has failed its missing
All we need is consensus on the rules.  Everything else is insignificant compared to that.  Therefore in a dispute the existing rules must prevail.  Characterizing this as developers being dictators of economic policy is wrong and misleading.

Setting the limit based on the median has all kinds of incentive problems.  Each miner could just make larger and larger blocks to maximise profits, hoping other miners make the smaller blocks.

You said that "July 2017 is right around the corner", I agreed with you.  Now you say its "a long time".  I think its really important to have a long term outlook in development, economic and engineering decisions.  It is very important that developers should not get distracted by short term considerations.
Or perhaps you disagreed with my comment about "building a strong robust platform for the future", would you prefer a non robust platform?


If Bitcoin is to succeed, then we need to reach a stage where there is genuine economic demand for Bitcoin transactions.  We have not quite got there yet, but I am optimistic we will achieve this success.  Once we have genuine economic demand for space in blocks, then the concept of non full blocks, with any blocksize limit, becomes meaningless.  Demand will be a function of price and for a low enough price demand will essentially be unbounded, therefore blocks will be full.  If we fail to achieve full blocks, Bitcoin has not succeeded.
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:22:20


Hmm.  Yes.  But what is it that is censorship resistant ?  I think it's the network rules....
Consider the following system :
* open source client wallet software, with a chain of blocks
* p2p network
* Monero like currency system, with very strong anonymity driven by stealth addresses and ring signatures 
* nominated supernode, that has a private key that needs to sign each block for it to be valid
Here we have an electronic monetary system.  Transactions are censorship resistant as they are anonymous, so cannot meaningfully  be blocked.
The only advantage Bitcoin has over this is the whole system cannot be easily taken down or replaced.  I.e. nobody can easily change the rules.  If we allow people to change the rules by making threats, we have nothing of substance

The change you talk about is technically no change to the consensus rules.  If we lose consensus over the rules, why on earth does economics matter at all?  Also its not a change in policy at all, over 70% of the coins have been issued, therefore as the whitepaper described, incentives transfer to fees.
And by the way, this is not just "core":
 
 * The overwhelming majority of developers are against the fork
 * Users are split
 * Businesses are split
 * Investors are split -  (In this case majority is against classic)  Also (
 * Miners are split
 * Node operators are split
 * Users are split
In my view doubt over any one of these groups should be enough to stop a hardfork.  In this case the community is split right down the middle, its a no brainer, we should oppose the hardfork.

Do you have data on the block height for Classic vs other and by datacenter?
That could be interesting
@_date: 2016-02-29 01:23:18
Consider the following:
* Miner "A" has 1% of the global hashrate, blocks it finds need to be propagated to the remaining 99% of global hashpower.
* Miner "B" has 40% of the global hashrate,  blocks it finds need to be propagated to the remaining 60% of global hashpower.
If orphaning costs are very significant, such that they drive transaction selection policy, which miner will have higher margins, A or B? (All else equal)

People agreed  to SegWit as a friendly compromise.  E.g. people saying I would like larger blocks 
What is not acceptable it threats/bargaining.  For example:
* we like SegWit, but won't activate unless you do a hardfork, or
* do a hardfork, or we else will run very stupid dangerous buggy code
The point is Bitcoin is an ambitious project that will attract attackers.  We need to be immune from threats and intimidation.  That is different from not doing friendly compromise, by considering the views and preferences  of others, which is of course fine

I am looking for evidence of contention.  Right now a strong majority support the current rules. If it becomes a significant minority we should still support the current rules.

**Examples of large successful global complex systems with no leadership**
* The English language (who is the leader of English?  If the leadership team at the Oxford dictionary all disappeared, I think most English speakers would be able to continue communicating in English.)
* HTML (as far as I know, html will work ok if the president of html gets hit by a bus)
* Gold (If the leader of the world  gold council jumps off a cliff, the global gold trading and gold investment systems should be just fine)
* The metric system (rulers and other measuring devices should continue to work without leadership)
* Hotels (I think the successful complex global network of thousands of hotels operating across the world will be ok if the president of the global hotel association is shot in the head)
* Books (thousands of authors across the world should continue to write, publish and distribute  complex and interesting books, after their leader gets locked up for murder)
* Global jihad (The idea of global Jihad and terrorism will continue, even if the US special forces kill the leader in a house in Pakistan)
Humaninity has successfully built many complex global systems without leadership, but based instead on **ideas**, standards  or evolutionary type mechanisms.  I'm my view, **the best ideas tend not to require a leader in order to succeed.**
I know it's difficult to wrap your head around.  The promise of Bitcoin is to make electronic money like these major successful  complex global systems, where there is no leader, in contrast to systems like the USD or EUR, which have leaders.  I think it can be done, we just need to be a bit more imaginative and open minded, and stop looking for a leader

What does 2MB in addition to 2MB mean?  You mean 2MB of non witness data?  
Why would we want more blockspace for buggy malleable  transaction data with quadratic scaling of sighash operations?
@_date: 2017-04-11 23:53:24


I think the theory is:
1. They first try with empty blocks
2. After they have found collisions using other methods, they try and mine with larger blocks
This explains why Antpool has more empty blocks than peers

The extension blocks proposal is not a smooth upgrade like SegWit, as far as user wallets are concerned.
For SegWit there are no significant issues for upgraded wallets sending funds to non upgraded wallets, and vice versa.
For extension blocks, payments from upgraded wallets to non upgraded wallets require 100 confirmations and payments to upgraded wallets, require two addresses being shown.  This is a huge deterioration in the quality of the user experience and makes extension blocks a non viable upgrade mechanism in practise, in my view.
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:13:31


That is nonsense.  What makes you say that?  The exact opposite is true.
SegWit solves the quadratic scaling of sighash operations bug.  This makes further blocksize limit increases safer and therefore more likely!
@_date: 2016-02-10 04:27:32

4 of the 5 core developers are against the rush for bigger blocks.  These people have contributed a lot to Bitcoin over many years and we should carefully listen to what they say.  We should also respect their honest motives.
Remember if 75% of the miners accsept a 1.1MB block as valid, 100% will still accsept a 0.999MB block as valid.  The advantage is with the status quo in a contaversial fork like this.

@_date: 2016-02-08 09:58:28






My point is each measurement that can be taken, that has even a low level of sybil defense, is in favor of the Core road-map and against XT/BU/Classic.  I am not claiming these measures are perfect, but they are all we have.  In contrast there are no measurements that show a majority of any constituency that are against Core, perhaps the exception of VC funded firms.


We just had a large round of miner voting, there was very strong, almost unanimous support for Core.


Please provide any data for these.  I don't see how exchanges count, as in my view exchanges have an obligation to their customers to support all forks and not participate in the consensus process.
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:36:24


I condemn that


I thought it was for promotion of running those clients before consensus.  Discussing ideas was always fine.  I think this goes right to the core of the issues.  To many people it was never about whether to hardfork, it was always about how to hardfork. Some people were VERY sensitive on this, as it goes right to the core of the sound money idea.  Unfortunately many people did not understand this and it caused a lot of mistrust.
As per this subreddit policy, can people promote running a client that enforces a UASF before widespread consensus?
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:39:30
The difference is that in the event of a dispute, the existing rules must prevail, this is core to Bitcoin's value proposition and prevents changes to other people's money occurring without their consent.  Adam Back is arguing in favor of the existing rules.

Flexible Transactions (The BU alternative fix to malleability)


Transactions that don't redeem the input by segregating the witness also get a capacity increase, as space is freed up by those that do segregate the witness.  Therefore all transactions get an effective capacity increase, even from non upgraded clients.  Although those upgrading to SegWit get a larger capacity increase.
**This is in contrast to a hardfork that requires ALL clients to upgrade anyway.**   Therefore SegWit's 2MB of capacity is **strictly faster** than an equivalent hardfork to 2MB of capacity.
SegWit is also **strictly more respectful to older transaction formats** than BU' s method of totally banning all old transaction types with FT
Do you see why there can't be further  compromise now?  SegWit is strictly better than what BU are proposing, in terms of achieving faster capacity increases

Does this confirm covert ASICBOOST or overt ASICBOOST? 
Please can you send a link to the code 
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:56:16


That is also true for the monero type system, with one validator who signs blocks, I mentioned above


Yes I do think it means that.  But not for all changes, just for hardforks, without overwhelming consensus across the entire community 
Who do you think appoints the head of the FOMC?  It's somebody appointed by the President, who is basically elected by a majority.  We already have a majority rules currency.  It's called the USD.  Bitcoin is  resistant to a hardfork, even if the majority wants it.  That is all that makes Bitcoin different 
But the above comparison to the USD and majority rule, merely explains our different views on what an ideal Bitcoin SHOULD be, not what Bitcoin actually is.  
* In my view Bitcoin would also be even better if a majority couldn't softfork without overwhelming consensus across the entire community.   However a majority CAN impose a softfork on an unhappy minority, whether I like it or not.  This is a weakness in Bitcoin I have to learn to accept. In my ideal world Bitcoin would be resistant to a majority softfork, but it isn't.  That's a fact 
* You also may need to accept that a majority cannot impose a hardfork on a significant unhappy  minority, without overwhelming consensus across the entire community, whether you like it or not. You may regard this as a weakness, however it is also something you may need to learn to accept.  In your ideal world a majority could do a hardfork, but they can't.  That's a fact

FYI. 
I never seem to have to pay a fee of more than  $0.03 at most, typically I set a fee of $0.01 and my transaction gets confirmed pretty fast.

As I explained, the faster it is needed the faster it will come in to play


They can upgrade at their leisure

Its necessary to upgrade, no upgrade method is perfect.  I think its relatively fine compared to other methods


No you implied this.  "And if all transactions were forced into SW via the fork, then we'd have 100% use right away anyway"


This is completely wrong and a total misrepresentation of my position.  My position is that in the event of a genuine dispute, the existing rules must prevail.  That has nothing to do with Core.  In addition what you say implies Core can do a contentious hardfork and I would follow, that again is totally false.  Please stop misrepresenting my stance.


No, clients can continue to do exactly what they do now.  When you receive a payment the client does not verify old signatures, it just traces the coins back to the genesis and verifies new signatures.  After this softfork, non upgraded clients can do exactly the same thing.  In addition, Anyone can pay is a valid transaction now already.
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:45:04


Well they will be working perfectly fine if nobody uses the new transaction type.

Please could you let me know the before AB date?
Sorry, I actually did produce a lot of charts on this, but they are on another computer I do not have access to right now.

To repeat again, this does not prove anything with respect to ASICBOOST.

Yes, after which the 1MB rule was not enforced, regardless of whether there was consensus across the entire community or not.  At the same time there was no replay protection or wipeout protection.  This made Classic dangerous and reckless and therefore promotion of it, before consensus, was very sensibly banned on As far as I was concerned at the time, a hardfork to 2MB was something I would have supported and I am sure the community would have supported this as well, had the proposal not been such a dangerous and reckless one. 
Remember the miner threshold was very stupid, it was not even **over** 75%, but **exactly 75%**, this almost guarantees a 25% vs 75% split.  In retrospect thank god decided to ban promotion of incompatible clients before consensus, otherwise Classic may have activated and it could have been total chaos and a huge destruction of system value


Sure, a client implementing this and **enforcing** the new rule before consensus, should not be promoted on r/bitcoin just like Bitcoin Classic.  In contrast a flag saying 8MB (e.g. BW pool), UASF or "crazy reckless HF to 100MB" are flags that would not be banned.  How many times does this need to be explained?


Well, that is why they should not run it in the first place, therefore they will not need to stop running it before consensus


But people were promoting the running of it BEFORE consensus


As I explained, promoting the running of a UASF enforcing node before consensus is NOT allowed on r/bitcoin, as far as I know
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:45:13
That is not scaling.  That is a capacity increase.  That was the whole point of my comment 
@_date: 2016-02-24 00:13:08


I think it is important, it exposes the key point and the whole concept of an equilibrium price where the market clears at a level where supply = demand.  **Why don't Toyota produce cars at the level where capacity is above demand or why don't Apple make iPhones at a level where capacity is above demand?**  The reason they **cannot do this** is because it makes no economic sense.  If the price of an iPhone fell to just 2 cent, the quantity demanded would be astronomical, I myself may demand millions of iPhones to use as a cheap building material.   Its not a trivial point about a definition.  


You have just picked the 2 cent level yourself, this is a a centrally determined price control measure.  Luckily this type of policy cannot be implemented in the consensus rules because there is no way for the protocol to know the FX rate.  For example what if 2 cent is too high for somebody doing an "actual legitimate" transactions, but not sufficient to prevent a "spammer"?  Who decides if fees are "very low" or not?  We can't just all agree that 2 cent is a sufficiently low price for a car so that everyone who wants one can get one, apart from spammers, then order Toyota to increase production until the car price falls to 2 cent.
It is clear there needs to be discussion in the community about this topic and to decide on a blocksize limit; before we can hopefully implement dynamic solutions.  The limit needs to be based on balanced and discussion of a suitable supply demand equilibrium for the next few years.  I do not think we can have this discussion in a reasonable way, if one side has the incomprehensible idea that somehow capacity must be above demand.  An economic system simply cannot work like that, **demand is a flexible type of quantity, that dynamically adjusts depending on capacity, therefore capacity cannot be above demand.**  In a more literal and obvious example, if X and Y are positive integers and X = 2Y, then it cannot be true that Y &gt; X.
Personally I could be ok with a dynamic minimum price level in the consensus rules, determined by miner votes. I would prefer BIP100 style voting on the blocksize, however if this is easier to get consensus, I would support BIP100 style min fee voting, within the bounds of technical limitations.

You make it sound like some say they support further hardfork's as a kind of trick to get support from others for SegWit.
I don't think you understand my point of view.  I dont want to trick anyone into supporting SegWit.  If people don't want SegWit I respect that and therefore don't want it either.
I only want others to support SegWit due to merit.  If I thought others were supporting SegWit as leverage to get others to support a hardfork, whether those others are being tricky or not, then I don't want SegWit.
I **only** want SegWit If it has the necessary support on merit.  If it doesn't have that necessary support  I don't want it either
Do you understand ?

If you want on and off chain scalling that is fine, I want that to.  What is not acceptable is trying to force this on others by attacking the network.  Instead you should have discussed and then compromised on the issue.   We could have easily had consensus by now on 4MB or BIP103.  Instead the large blockers rejected the deals and carried on trying to attack the network.  These attacks created a lot of tension and animosity which now make a hardfork very difficult.  Core then united behind a clever and effective scalling path.  The only reasonable thing to do is rally behind this.  Once people stop advocating attacks, then maybe we can increase the blocksize.  I do not think a blocksize increase is possible during these attacks as it's too risky.
@_date: 2016-02-29 01:28:03
Consider the following:
* Miner "A" has 1% of the global hashrate, blocks it finds need to be propagated to the remaining 99% of global hashpower.
* Miner "B" has 40% of the global hashrate, blocks it finds need to be propagated to the remaining 60% of global hashpower.
This gives a large advantage to B, merely on the basis of being larger, this is not a technical efficiency.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:56:49


No, even that irrational argument would make no sense.  As when you do that hardfork, you could always add more safety restrictions, which could remove that 8MB spam concern

It consensus rules of money can be or are bargained in this way, then I see no fundemental value in it and will use the USD instead.

I am not asking them to that.  I just consider any judgement made not on technical merit, but for political reasons to manipulate people,  as illegitimate and will assign it zero weight.
I am entitled to do that.  Hopefully enough economic  nodes also think like that, so the integrity of the money is strong enough to be sufficiently different form the USD to have sustainable  value.   


**You may think this is naive.  I think it's naive to think Bitcoin has any other interesting characteristics, other than the rules being immune from political interference, or features deriving from this potential charecteristic**
Or, perhaps we are both naive, and Bitcoin has no fundamental  utility.

That sounds like an annoying problem, people may not be happy with this.  Some existing users may get annoyed that they cannot send the funds.
I guess upgraded wallets could have a display old address switch/button.

What matters for orphan risk is the probability of a block being built on top of it.  It is only the hashpower that builds blocks.  Therefore it is the speed of propagation to the hashpower that matters.

A hardfork which causes a chain split and means existing nodes do not recognise the new blocks as valid.  This is a classic and textbook attack, not new arbitrary conditions like you imply.


No we need strong consensus amoung all constituent parts of the network to change the rules.  Why was 95% chosen in the past for uncontroversial softforks,  but 70% is chosen for a controversial hardfork?  The reason is the attackers are afraid of failing to get strong consensus.  This clearly demonstrates Classic is an attack rather than a consensual move.  Therefore despite the fact I personally support 2MB, I regard Classic as an attack and will try to defend Core.


No.  This is about ensuring the existing rules prevail in a dispute, otherwise the 21M cap means nothing.

It's an attack on the whole chain not just the rule.
I don't recognise the concept of the limit being hit.  If Bitcoin is useful and the price is low enough, demand for blockspace is unbounded.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:37:59


These are all good points.  However another good point about SegWit compared to EB, is that the upgrade is easier for wallets, since transacting between upgraded and non upgraded wallets has no significant issues with SegWit
With jl2012's EB idea, non upgraded users need to wait 100 blocks before spending funds from upgraded users.  This is a large reduction in usability and change in the user experience.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:28:27


I think patience is a very important quality to have.  If SegWit does not happen before November this year, I think we should just try again.
As for BU happening, I think Jihan has shown he is hostile.  My view on this has changed now.  Lets call their bluff.  (Just hopefully they add replay protection and wipeout protection for their new coin like CLAMs has)  We have already had Bitcoin Clams, I do not see why BU will be all that different to Bitcoin Clams, and that did not cause system problems.
@_date: 2016-02-04 00:03:39


That already happened.


Not necessarily true, for example BU clients.  I dont see the advantage here anyway.


This is a very bad idea.  What about SPV wallets?  You force them all to upgrade as well.


No it is not.  1. Many other than "core" oppose the previously proposed increases.  2. Veto is not a dictatorship, it is a preference for the existing rules.


No, in the face of ANY threat or argument over the rules, we must stick with the existing rules.  If not we fail


Not true at all.  If a soft fork occurs, you can carry on with the old security model and non seg-wit if you like.  Just dont accept seg-wit payments.

I don't know.  I hope so.  I would encourage people only to flag support and discourage people enforcing the rule.  I think that's what almost everyone is doing with the "comment flag"


I have no problem with clearly flagging support as I made clear up in on this thread.  What BW with the 8MB flag is fine.
The problem is enforcement before consensus

You could be right here.  However if you look at this website:
You can see that PwC is the auditor, Swissquote is the custodian and Ganado is the legal advisor, these reputable companies are likely to be expensive.  Also, according to the Malta company register setting up this fund company cost EUR100,000.
Whoever is behind this, it looks like an expensive and sophisticated operation

No it is not the same risk for **any** TX.  If a block containing a mainchain transaction is orphaned (e.g. Segwit), then the transaction can just get in another block.  In this extension block case that cannot happen and the funds are guaranteed to be lost

If blocks are 8MB, the fees will fall, therefore the cost of getting 1MB of spam on the blockchain will fall.  Moving spam from the memepool (a temporary issue) to the UTXO (a permanent issue) is a bad idea.  Increasing the blocksize makes the spam problem worse.
Anyway in the medium run, if the blocksize goes to 8MB, spammers will NOT need to spend 8x more to flood blocks.  The necessary fees to outbid normal users will be driven by the economic demand for genuine transactions, increasing the blocksize will not necessarly increase this threshold.

As a community we need to take a stronger stance against potentially hostile actors like Gavin, Jihan Wu and Peter Rizun who promote or advocate such malicious attacks.

It is not because its my own actions.  Its because the "threat" you are talking about is not threatening to change the consensus rules.  You seem to keep ignoring the point, its about monetary integrity.


Well I do not really  know what you mean here.  I have never heard of Core developers complaining that too many people are running BTCD, BCoin, Libbitcoin or other clients not written by them.
Please note, BU, XT and Classic were 99% written by Core developers.  The problem with them is they are incompatible without getting consensus BEFORE people run them.


No.  But BU is nowhere near the bury line.  WIth c40% of miners flagging something like BU, I see little hope of friendly compromise


Firstly this is not true.  The point is not whether we hardfork.  But whether its done in a safe sensible way, or a stupid reckless and unnecessarily dangerous way.  The reason there has not been a hardfork is the aggressive pushing for a dangerous hardfork
@_date: 2017-04-21 00:41:28


I agree.  And at the same time we should be humble and realistic and therefore recognize that the state's financial system is much better than ours overall.  The USD systems are:
* faster
* cheaper
* more reliable
* have higher transaction capacity
* easier to use
* more widely accepted, globally
* more liquid
* more distributed
* more anonymous (it has a very effective and widely used 2 way pegged sidechain called paper money)
* better at censorship resistant transactions (again using the sidechain), and
* even better suited to reliably do things like smart contracts (e.g. direct debit)
Bitcoin offers a niche alternative, that may only offer real value to a minority of people.  The only thing Bitcoin has going for it (other than hype) is that the rules of the system are highly resistant to change.  Lets remember that when we discuss changing the rules

Running or promotion of a client that just flags support for a consensus rule change is fine, even a hardfork.  For example BW having an 8MB flag is fine.
I think what is not allowed is promotion of a client that enforces new rules or no longer enforces existing rules,  before consensus

The BU people have been doing this for over a year now, especially on the issue of Xthin.

No, BIP101 went from 20MB to 8GB in 2035.  It is that excessive and shocking move which caused huge animosity from the community.  Core devs then put forward various compromise proposals like BIP103, which were rejected by Gavin and the large blockers.  This gave Core little choice but to defend the status quo until the attacks were defeated, otherwise the network could split in 3.
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:56:14
Gavin rejected 2MB and attacked the network with XT instead.  Gavin could have built consensus and instead he attacked.  As a result Core had to unite behind the existing rules to defeat the attack.

Think of two types of softfork.
1. New rule - If the coinbase transaction contains the word "Rabbit123", then it must also contain the word "Mouse"
2. New rule - The coinbase transaction MUST contain the word "Rabbit123"
If less than 51% of the miners upgrade to a type 2 softfork, then yes, this will cause a chainsplit.  Upgraded nodes will enforce the rule that there must be the work "Rabbit123" and by default non upgraded miners will not do this.
However, SegWit is like a type 1 softfork, it only matters when there is a word "Rabbit123", otherwise there are no extra rules.  Non upgraded miners do not have the word "Rabbit123" in their  coinbase, therefore even if less than 51% of miners upgrade, it will not necessarily cause a chainfork.  A chainfork only occurs if miners upgrade to a new special client that includes the word "Rabbit123", but not "Mouse".  Since miners need to upgrade to a new client to make these incompatible blocks, this is really just a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 01:57:48
Erik, SegWit is already more than 2MB.  Why do you indirectly help spread divisive misinformation by calling your proposal "SEGWIT2MB", when its already over 2MB?
Also, the community either wants SegWit or they don't. If people like SegWit, but instead of supporting it prefer to use it as leverage to obtain some other objective, we should reject that stance.  One should never put Bitcoin in jeopardy by rejecting a proposal one supports, as a tactic to achieve other ends.
@_date: 2016-02-23 06:28:56
We need to maximize the product of these three things.  Which individual ones becomes too political, therefore we need a neutral way of maximizing the product of the three things.
This is why BIP100 is so smart, it allows miners to vote on the block-size limit to maximse the product of these three variables.
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:14:35
I have tried to provide an explanation of the theory here:
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:33:22
People either want SegWit, based on merit, or they don't.  If people don't want it, fine, I accept that.
Damaging the integrity of the currency by doing a quid pro quo style compromise, with people using one consensus rule change  as a negotiating tactic to achive another one, is not acceptable to me.
   
@_date: 2017-04-03 06:08:26


That is your opinion.  Some people share your opinion and others don't share it.
However, since there is no client or software that implements this vision, there is little practical significance to your opinion, in this case 
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:42:33


If you want to generate 4MB of spam, you still need to pay up for that space.
Secondly, there are more complex ways at looking at the cost of spam rather than just simply looking at space.   For example the impact on the UTXO, verification times, ect ect
This is the point of block weight, it **improves** the metric, so its more aligned to the cost.
Also, the maximum potential throughput of SegWit enabled blocks, in terms of number of inputs + number of outputs, is way larger than the 2.1MB expected average effective throughput.
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:54:32
No its not true of "either side".  Personally I would prefer 2MB, blocks.  However I will fully support Core and the existing rules as there is no overwhelming consensus (or even a clear majority) in favour of changing the rules.  I do not support imposing my personal preference for 2MB on a significant number of other people against their will. In the event of contention over the rules we must rally behind the existing rules, or Bitcoin has failed.
@_date: 2016-02-27 15:57:48
And that's without contention.
One would think you would need a lot of practice at this before going ahead knowing the passengers had a passionate disagreement about which wheels to change.

That is very expensive and why would anyone want to do this? If you think a hedge fund would short bitcoin and do this remember, the attack is transparent, risky, unsustainable and involves buying/owning large amounts of bitcoin.
For $650k a hedge fund could short bitcoin and lease the entire mining industry for 100 blocks.  They could then double spend and crash the price.  (If such a leasing market existed).

In these discussions I think it is important to keep in mind what is going on here.  A disparate group of miners across the world perform billions of SHA256 hashes a second, in hope of generating a huge amount of leading zeros, which meet a necessary target and the miners compete with each other over who is first.  Other miners then build on the chain with the highest cumulative difficulty targets.  This process is crazy, absurd, resource intensive and complicated.  It is truly remarkable and amazing that it has worked for so long.  Expecting this process to be faster and cheaper than centralised systems, which have a huge variety of far more basic and simple mechanisms for choosing the one true version of the dataset, is unreasonable in my view.
 
That is not to say I don’t think technological improvements can result in reasonably cheap and fast transactions.  I think we can achieve this and hope we do.  However, please do not think we can get anywhere near what centralised systems can achieve, especially if they are being pushed back by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:47:27


**Let me give you an example**
1.   Alice has upgraded to extension blocks and needs to make a payment to Bob (who has not upgraded), who then needs to make a payment to Charlie.  (Alice -&gt; Bob -&gt; Charlie)
2.   Alice pays Bob using the resolution transaction.  The resolution transaction is confirmed in a block
3.   Bob sees the incoming payment, with one confirmation, and then uses the output of this transaction to make a payment to Charlie
4.   Charlie then receives his payment, and delivers the goods or services to Bob
5.   The block with the resolution transaction is then orphaned, by another block, also from a miner who has upgraded to extension blocks.  This new replacement block also contains a resolution transaction, which still includes the payment from Alice to Bob.  Bob therefore still receives his funds
6.   However, since this new resolution transaction is different than the previous one, the TXID has changed.  This means the payment from Bob to Charlie is now invalid and will never confirm
7.   Charlie now needs to ask Bob to pay him again
 
The above is a severe reduction in the quality of user experience for Charlie, who is likely to be very confused and attackers have the opportunity to double spend.  This is very different to how Bitcoin works today and as such extension blocks are not practical. 
This is actually the same problem that we have with the block reward and why miners must wait 100 blocks before spending this. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:18:58


No I am not.  And that's also not the point, we must never change the rules as a result of a threat.  Keeping the rules the same is fine 


Miners where saying they would attack.  PoW change is a last resort, to be used only when necessary to keep the coin working.


That is not a threat... Developers don't get paid from people running their code.


Sure.  What is wrong with compromise out of choice, not need?


What is your point?  I am not saying threats don't result in change in society.  Or in the USD....
That would be a very  stupid thing to say...
I am saying the only interesting characteristic Bitcoin has is resilience to changes in the rules, as a result of threats...
   
@_date: 2016-02-29 01:12:12


That is not true, as far as I am aware everyone who believes a fee market is an inevitability and necessacity thinks we need more effective block propagation for the following reasons:
1. This is already an issue now at 1MB
2. Improvements increase the range of values that could be allowed in a fee market driven blocksize solution
3.  Improvments are always good anyway
I detect some cynicism in your obviously incorrect claim that fee market proponents don't want the network to get better.
@_date: 2017-04-04 07:57:05
Ok thanks.   I think that's a good idea to keep this voluntary for miners (like SegWit).  A miner could also choose to upgrade and enforce the new extension block rules, but not actually create an extension block or put in the commitment.  That way the miner has no extra risk.
**User Wallets**
Please can you explain how this will work for user wallets?  Can non upgraded wallets receive funds from an upgraded wallet where the inputs of the transaction is in the extension block?  What about a non upgraded wallet creating a transaction where the output goes into an extension block and some outputs do not go into the extension block?  Are these processes seamless for users?

Yes I deny it now.  I hope demand for bitcoin transactions increases such that blocks will be full and then remain full.  Full blocks is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:31:17


Yes, I have tried to do this.  These are my suspected reasons for opposition to SegWit:
* malicious intent towards bitcoin
* Stubbornness.  People already decided they want a hardfork, and are unable to be rational and do what is best for Bitcoin, even if the larger block  size people wanted has been solved without a hardfork 
* passionate hatred over the Reddit moderation policy somehow stupidly influencing  their view of Bitcoin protocol decisions 
* desperate desire to win an argument at all costs
* irrational belief that increasing the blocksize limit reduces the pressure to increase the blocksize again, which makes a hardfork less likely in the future (this is particularly odd as the exact opposite is true, since SegWit solves the quadratic scaling of sighash operations bug, making further blocksize limit increases more likely).  This is in effect wishing to hold users hostage, with higher fees, so they can be pressured more easily into supporting a simplistic  blocksize limit increase.  I would classify this as malicious 
* genuine lack of ability to understand SegWit, caused by a lack of intellectual curiosity, which causes frustration and anger 
* ego driven desire to be in control of the system and force changes on it
* to pursue a vendetta against ones enemies
* believing false information by malicious entities spreading lies about SegWit.
List of lies about SegWit:
* SegWit is an efficiency gain and doesn't actually increase the blocksize. 
* SegWit is not onchain scaling.   
* SegWit is a slower capacity increase than a comparable   hardfork. 
* SegWit is compulsory for miners
* SegWit takes away from the space available for old style transactions
* SegWit allows funds to be stolen by using anyone can spend kludge.  
* AXA and Bilderberg put in SegWit as a backdoor to destroy the system.   
* Malleability is not a significant problem.  Malleability is actually a feature
* Core laugh at Jihan behind his back and say there will never be a hard-fork
Why do you think people oppose SegWit?


Of course changing opinions is ok.  But to launch an aggressive campaign for 2MB blocks in a dangerous way and then to have developers deliver it in a safe way, but to oppose it, and to start pushing for BU. Something about that seems hostile to Bitcoin to me.
How else would you explain that?  I used to think like you until recently, I didn't think that many BU supporters were hostile.  But after they had it explained to them again and again how broken BU was, after all the nodes were taken down due to bugs in Xthin twice, after explaining the median EB attack again and again, after explaining the ironic variant of the median EB attack, after explaining the need for wipeout protection for over a year, after begging them to add replay protection for 12 months, after showing them the  BU developers were motivated by hatred and had BLOCKSTREAM_CORE_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE as a constant in their code, after asking for onchain coordination for the hardfork, after explaining how BU fundamentally destroys the core machine consensus property of Bitcoin and replaces it with human consensus, after demonstrating that BU makes multiple confirmation double spend attacks far easier, after being refused BU membership and therefore unable to propose fixes (despite spending a day reading the BU main.cpp file and finding problems), ect ect ect
After all this, they still campaign for BU and c40% of miners still mine with the BU flag.  If I don't believe they are hostile now, I'm clearly a total moron. Sorry.
Please join me in calling BU what it is, call a spade a spade.  BU is dangerous, stupid and, above all, hostile.  If as a community we cant call out something like this, then I just think we are too weak to succeed.
Lets campaign to end the BU flag from the miners.  Once this gets low, then we can finally patiently start the campaign for a safe hardfork, like Johnson Lau's spoonent (

If technically inferior changes are made to Bitcoin for political reasons, why is Bitcoin any better than the USD?
The resistance of the rules to political change is the only reason Bitcoin may have good characteristics as money.  
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:01:58


It can be done: 
* No significant opposition from developers 
* Implementation and support from **all significant development teams**
* Letters of support and commitment to run the client across industry
* Node flagging
* Miner flagging
* No significant opposition at conferences/meetups
Ironically, very similar to the strong demonstration of widespread ecosystem opposition to BU, just in reverse.  
Actually many industry players have recently come out and said what they expect from a hardfork, in order to consider supporting it and calling this new coin Bitcoin:
* Replay protection
* Onchain coordination process
* Wipe out protection
Please note that BU does none of these things.  Even the most basic.

Splitting the string into 64 byte chunks is an inherent part of sha256
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:25:35
One 64 byte chunk of data remains the same for multiple hash attempts and part of the solution to that chunk can be used for multiple hash attempts.
This means the miner does not need to do all the operations in the hash function to provide a hash attempt.

How do we know that?
This assumes profit margins at 1%, but what makes us think this is the case.  Average profit margins in the industry could be c50% not 1%.
There is this misconception going around, that because of the difficulty adjustment average profit margins in the mining industry are low.  This is not true, the difficulty adjustment just means that the profit margins of the most marginal miner are low.  If a large proportion of the global hashrate has costs much lower than the most marginal miner, these lower cost miners can maintain high margins.

No you just said if all *core* gained consensus.

That is not what this is about.  This is about developers sticking with the existing rules.

A softfork is a consensus change.  But it's less extreme than a hardfork.
For example, even with less than 51% miner support, in a chainsplit the softfork  has the asymmetric advantage so it's less risky.  With 51% miner support a chainsplit is avoided
A softfork can't create new coins or steal funds like a hardfork

You seem to have ignored my point about soft vs hardfork 


Also what is unique about PoW blockchains compared to the USD or an anonymous blockchain with a single signer.  I was not talking about bitcoin vs Litecoin 


Also it's not that I prefer inimitable rules.  I prefer the USD.  I just think an alternative model is good as an alternative  
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:10:17


I don't understand why that would be the case.  Are you saying we should make the existing transaction formats invalid in one go?  I think that would be a large unnecessary risk that nobody is proposing. (People do propose moving to seg-wit as a hard fork, buit I think this is to make it cleaner with respect to the blocksize limit and avoid the anyone can pay hack, it won't force behavior like you suggest)


It allows for an effective increase in the blocksize without a hardfork.  This is because a hardfork is difficult due to the extreme behavior of many participants and the perception that the network is under attack.  During this kind of attack it is vital to support the existing consensus rules to defend the system integrity.  If a political attack or political movement of any kind can change consensus rules where there is contention, the system is as good as dead.

Why do you want to increase space for buggy malleable transactions with quadratic scaling of sighash operations when these issues have already been fixed with SegWit?
One of the main points of SegWit is to fix the quadratic scaling of sighash operations bug, so that we can do large increases in the blocksize  limit.  This is one of the main reasons some people have been opposing a blocksize limit increase for years.  What is the point in now opening up the quadratic scaling attack vector, which people have been trying to avoid, just as the problem is solved?
How do you know some Core developers have not worked out large quadratic scaling attack blocks, that they are keeping private as they would cause problems even at 1MB, but would be devastating at 2MB?


Please explain this in a bit more detail.  What would the block weight limit be?

Neither of these are a permanent solution to the blocksize....  For example a simple hardfork and bump is certainly  not a long term solution.  A longer term solution may be something like BIP100

Or just spend the altcoin to a different output...  You do not need to "sell" it
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:11:05


So what if the fee goes down?  What matters is total fee revenue, which miners will vote to maximize


I agree, that is why BIP100 is an economic policy.  For technical reasons we may still need an upper bound.  Until eventually, due ot technological improvements, the economic level is well below the technical upper bound such that it is safe to remove the technical upper bound.  This may be a long way off though.

I think Antpool now has c3% empty blocks  compared to most peers at c0.5%.  Antpool also has a lot more smaller blocks
I think the drop in March 2016 was caused by a large memepool after that point.  Which caused an industry wide drop off in empty blocks.  I think Antpool had like a c12% rate then, compared to peers on 5%
Please check all this yourself  
@_date: 2017-04-03 06:36:07


Well it did not.  The original Satoshi client had many rules which blocks needed to follow to be valid.  You are mistaken


Yes, it is my opinion.  I do think longest **valid** chain is a good idea.  However there are also nodes I run that implement my opinion, therefore how I think the network should run actually exists in practise.  In contrast there is not now, nor has there ever been, a piece of software that only follows the longest chain without checking for any other rules.  Therefore your opinion for how the network should run has no basis in reality, at present anyway, it's just a philosophical idea.
 
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:14:11


Waiting one block seems like a small pain, but I agree, it's not that bad.
But what if the block with the resolution transaction gets orphaned? Then will the new block with another resolution transaction be different, such that the next transaction spending the output is invalid?
Doesn't this mean one should not spend the output of the resolution transaction until it has 100 confirmations, like the block reward, since the risk is the same? (Is it the same?) Otherwise chains of transactions could be wiped out.
This seems like a very  large usability issue.


Sure.  But I am thinking of ensuring a smooth and non disruptive transition period.  And also a proposal humble enough to ensure the system works well even if a lot people don't use the new system, would be good.

SegWit is an increase in the blocksize to over 2MB, despite some people preferring to to keep 1MB.  Actually I thought a blocksize increase to 2MB was EXACTLY what the large blockers wanted!!

This is the biggest concern with EB for me.  If upgraded wallets cannot send funds to old wallets in a reasonably seamless way, then this idea is more of an interesting academic excersize than a practical solution.
For some reason, in contrast to jl2012's January post, the new EB proposal seems to also break seamless payments in the other direction (old wallets to new wallets).  But I do not really understand why this needs to be the case.  Does anyone know?

Segwit is a faster capacity increase than a 2MB hardfork.  For SegWit the increase occurs as soon as people start upgrading.  For a hardfork the capacity increase only occurs after everyone upgrades

If blockspace is plentiful then seg-wit uptake may be slow.  If your ironic doomsday scenario of Bitcoin suddenly becoming massively inherently popular plays out (which has never happened before and growth has always been reasonably stable), and fees increase to $0.5, then there is an incentive to switch to seg-wit.  Therefore there is no issue here either way.

That is why Core is not trying to force or threaten anything.
Core put out a proposal for 2MB blocks, its up to the community whether  we want it or not.  Core listened to the community and many said they wanted larger blocks, however Core put in a 95% miner threshold to try and make sure it would not happen if some people did not want it.
What is not acceptable to me is threats to achieve a hardfork.  Core are not doing that

There is plenty of strong evidence of Antpool having more empty blocks and smaller blocks than other miners.  Just get the data and make a chart for yourself.  Here is some data from Bitfury:

By adding a new transaction you get no more efficiency that just changing the extra nonce.
The idea, is that, for example, by swapping the same transaction in and out, you save hashes, as you have already hashed that transaction and perhaps hashed up the tree from it already.
The simplest example, is shuffling the higher level branches on the right hand side of the tree.  I do not think this is the best method, but its the simplest way to see how one saves on hashes (only two extra hashes required), therefore I included it in the illustration

Yes, Adam has been talking about this for a while. has also done a lot of work on extension blocks. (jl2012 proposed it in 2013 - 
I think one of the issues is that upgrading to extension blocks could be confusing and difficult for users, as upgraded and non upgraded wallets will have issues transacting with each other, in both directions.  One way (old wallet to upgraded wallet) requires showing two addresses and the other way (upgraded wallet to old wallet) requires 100 confirmations before the next transaction can be spent (I think).  This will damage the user experience or as jl2012 called it, a "huge limitation".  Is this right?
In contrast, Segwit has no significant issues when upgraded wallets and non upgraded wallets transact, in either direction. This  is a big positive and results in a smooth, easy and low risk upgrade.
I think this is why SegWit was chosen.  Extension blocks/side chains are probably a very good area of research and experimentation for the longer term or smaller risky opt in area.  But they are might not a great shorter term scaling idea, as a system wide upgrade could be disruptive to the ecosystem/users/businesses.

No its not.  It is about making a gradual change with little risk.  This is a very good way to do it.  Even if it is a hardfork, I think we should still use the anyone can pay method, to achieve this.  You cant expect all payment types to switch in one go?


Core are not "in".  The point is the existing rules must have priority in a genuine dispute, that principle has nothing to do with Core.


It was acceptable for me as well.  However Gavin rejected it and carried on pushing for bigger blocks.  Therefore we were left with no choice but to keep the existing rules.  Core now has a very good scalling programme which many developers support.  This is now the best way forward.  Personally I would be happy with 2MB, but there is too much contention.  I will not force imposing my preference on others, the existing rules MUST prevail in a genuine dispute, or the system is as good as dead.

Bitcoin has only been a highly specialized niche technology for the last few years, with extremely limited demand for its use.  Its essentially been a non economic good, with no real economic demand.  If this situation continues and demand remains low, a 1MB blocksize limit is fine.  If demand increases and becomes economically relevant, then demand becomes a function of price and there is no concept of capacity being above demand.  I still think we may need to increase the blocksize and have low fees, but this needs to be discussed in the framework of demand dynamically changing as the price changes, otherwise the discussion makes no sense and a reasonable capacity expansion is unlikley to be achieved.


The question you ask is an economic question about demand for a resource (blockspace).  As I tried to explain above analyzing an economic system with the idea that capacity should be above demand is flawed.  In this context it is clear your hypothetical question makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:04:00
This is not what I mean, let me try to explain:
1. Lets assume Bitcoin is useful, a reasonable assumption since otherwise this whole thing is pointless.
2. If something is both useful and free then demand will be very high.  For example imagine if iPhones where free, demand would be very high and it would be totally unfeasible for Apple to supply enough iPhones to meet demand.
3. If fees are sufficiently low it is therefore reasonable to assume blocks will be full, whether this is 1MB, 20MB or 100MB
Bitcoin is new and has only really been used in a very niche way by geeks.  Bitcoin may continue to grow and more people will find it useful, as it matures it moves out of the very niche environment and begins to have actual uses.  this could be as a payment network, proof of existence, some kind of game, who knows.  I think its reasonable to assume the following:
Bitcoin is successful =&gt; Bitcoin has utility =&gt; there is demand to use Bitcoin, such that if fees are too low demand is very high, effectively infinite if prices are zero

Please read this:


That is exactly what Core has done.  Faster signature verification improves the **capability** of the system to accommodate more growth.  If you are looking to describe capacity increase try not to use the word scaling or scale, which is something different and causes confusion/animosity.  For example your chat with @_date: 2016-09-14 04:18:22
Mining rewards represent the economic value of network security.  The higher the rewards the more secure the network.
Therefore we should seek to maximise:
     Bitcoin price * (average fee * tx volume + block reward)
Where the block reward is the only part of the equation that is known.

There is nothing wrong with putting out an alternative implementation.  The problem is putting out an implementation with incompatible rules, without consensus.  Not only is there no consensus, a clear majority of developers, node operators, miners and investors have come out against the attacks.  Then the attacking client chooses a 75% activation ratio, almost guaranteeing a catastrophic dispute.  If this is not an attack I don't know what is.


It is not a small committee of central planners.  It is a basic principal that in the event of a dispute, the existing rules prevail.  This is how Bitcoin defends the 21m cap.  It is not being rules by anyone, but just a strong bias in favor of the existing rules.  However ironically a vast majority of nodes, developers, miners and investors support Core (the only groups that can be measured), so calling it a small group is wrong in two counts.


Again, nobody has control, it is merely supporting the existing implemented rules.

Why does the fact that private blockchains don't seem to make much sense imply anything positive about Bitcoin's blockchain?  In my view private blockchains are a bad idea all on their own and this fact has no significant  implications (positive or negative) for Bitcoin

Being resilient against double spend is the *only* unique characteristic of the network.  All other potential features seem to derive from this.


Rising fees are a positive indicator,  it indicates stronger demand.  As for blocksize policy, I agree the aim should be to maximise the product of fee, the price and volume, while also ensuring the limit is low enough not to cause technical problems and mining centralisation.  I disagree with the idea that a smaller fee automatically implies the product of the fee and volume will be higher, although this could be the case in some circumstances

I do not think its because they invested in significantly less risky assets than most of their peers.  It is probably because they were one of the main deposit taking banks in the system, such that JP Morgan's liquidity improved in the GFC, as concerned depositors withdrew from other smaller banks and money market funds.
For example:
* In December 2007 JP Morgan had $741bn of deposits, more than the $520bn of loan assets, a ratio of 1.42x
* In December 2009, JP Morgan had $938bn of deposits, more than the $633n of loan assets, a ratio of 1.48x
I think JP Morgan did engage in illegal practices, including having bad, fraudulent and over valued mortgage assets on its balance sheet, just like its peers.  The government effectively bailed the system out by introducing new liquidity into the system, which pushed up the value of these, as well as other, assets.
I would not say its true that JP Morgan has had significantly fewer  violations than its peers:

@_date: 2017-09-07 03:36:02
Why not oppose 2x and support better hardforks with new P2P magic, new address format, wipeout protection for light clients and strong 2 way replay protection? For example Core just rolled out new P2P magic and new transaction types, why on earth should the hardfork coin copy these things and cause problems for both sides?  This applies whether the new coin is supposed to be "THE TRUE BITCOIN" or not. 2x is therefore clearly a hostile attack! 
Constructing hardforks in a dangerous and destructive way, like 2x is a lose lose situation, that will cause mass destruction of value.  We all should oppose 2x.

Roger Ver:


I could not agree with Roger more.  What a brilliant philosophy.  I have no problem with Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash is Roger's vision and he should be free to use and promote it.  Lets respect that.
Such a shame 2x (along with XT, Bitcoin Classic and BU) do not share that vision and do not respect those who would prefer to keep using the existing system.
Bitcoin is about user choice.  As "large blockers" often say, they prefer hardforks over softforks because it gives users choice.  Therefore please add strong replay protection to 2x and allow users to make their choice.
There is a degree of authenticity to Roger.  He says he wants larger blocks, and now he has forked away to a new coin with larger blocks, I respect that.  Good on him.  I genuinely wish him and his coin the best of luck.  On the other hand I have little respect for the 2x people trying to force their will on others.  If people want to follow the existing chain, just let them.  Just like Roger is allowed his larger block chain.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:57:14


What do you mean?  Core developers have put forward safe hardfork plans....  See Johnson Lau's Spoonnet.  What is your problem with Spoonnet? 
However many hardfork advocates are not rallying around this and instead keep supporting wave after wave of poorly implemented coercive hardforks
Erik, please leave the NYA and join the list of Spoonnet hardfork supporters, which includes Core developers  
But regardless of what Core do, please can you respond to my question.  Why don't you support and promote a hardfork with the friendly opt-in philosophy I mentioned?


Yes it's frustrating for all this time to pass.  But we need people to stop supporting these dangeous ideas like 2x/BU/XT ect.
Let's rally behind Spoonet.  Then once there is strong support, let's have a patient period of coding, review, analysis, testing, game theory analysis, criticism ect ect.  If rigorous standards are met and there is widespread agreement, then we roll out the upgrade.
The 2 years of frustration have been caused by companies supporting such dangerous hardforks meaning the community had to be on the defensive.  Remember how Coinbase, Xapo and Bitpay committed to run XT?  XT was a ridiculous idea locking in increases to 8GB blocks, giving the smaller block chain the asymmetric advantage and locking in 25% miner support for the smaller block chain. This was almost guaranteed to result in a total chain wipeout, as financial speculators would join the 25% of miners and make a huge profit wiping out the XT chain.  This proposal was almost optimally stupid. After people explained these problems, XT support from companies  stubbornly remained.  Then they supported Bitcoin Classic which had the same flaws. You brought up the last 2 years, but don't you think XT supporters like Coinbase deserve their share of the blame for all these delays, rather than who were forced on the defensive to protect the system and oppose XT/Classic by rallying behind the existing rules?  It's time these companies actually listened to experts when they explain how bad the hardforks they support are, then put an end to these dangerous ideas and start to support safe hardforks.
Please join me in the safe hardfork camp Erik.

Your logic appears to be that because anyone CAN do something irresponsible, they SHOULD do something irresponsible.  I had the same issue with BU, my argument is that BU is a bad idea and people SHOULD not support it, this was constantly misrepresented as me saying "BU CANNOT be supported."


BTC is more widely adopted than ETH.  As an ETH user, the hardforks did cause disruption

I am fine with that


Sure, just ignore those people and move away to a new chain
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:22:11


I agree.  Hardforking away without key safety mechanisms, such as strong 2 way replay protection, is arrogant, reckless irresponsible and hostile.  However, **2x will happen and is likely to cause mass disruption and loss of value, unless we the community fight against it**.  If the community cannot be bothered to fight against 2x and stop it, it is naive to think we will be strong enough to ensure Bitcoin succeeds in the challenging and bumpy road ahead.
I kindly ask all members of the community to join the fight against 2x.  We must do whatever it takes to make sure the hardfork is safe.
Please contact the NYA signatories and ask them to either demand 2x is made safe or abandon it:
* bitFlyer - 
* ANX - 
* Bitfury - 
* BitPay - 
* Blockchain.info - 
* BTCC - 
* Coinbase - 
* ShapeShift - 
Let them know that as implemented, 2x is dangerous and that is not what they signed up for.  If these companies want to fork away, that is fine, but they should do it in a safe way that respects those who choose not to follow them.  Let the NYA signatories know that the person who proposed the idea, cited in the NYA, supports making the hardfork safe ( but the developer irresponsibly team refuses to do so. 
The NYA signatories are under no obligation to support a dangerous hardfork and instead should demand a safe one.
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:47:39
Well there are bad softforks like freezing funds.  Hope that doesn't happen.  There are also opt in softforks, which are less coesive  
But luckily a softfork can never steal money or create inflation, from the point of view of those that don't opt in.
A softfork is a lot easier to do, for example miners can force it on users.  That is a statement of fact, even though it's unethical, miners can do it.  I oppose unpopular softforks just like I oppose unpopular hardforks.
But what is your point?  How does any of that justify causing chaos?
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:59:32


Ok hashrate minority...  But what about price? 


Because those transactions would be invalid, so that would be a hardfork and create a new chain
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:23:20


Doesnt make it not an attack.  Im not saying it cannot happen, I am saying those that do it are hostile.


Thats a threat...  I personally will ONLY agree to 2x if there is no threat.  If we give in to threats and change Bitcoin's rules due to them, Bitcoin is useless.  The 21m cap is meaningless


Right..  I am saying what we SHOULD do is defend against attackers and what we should NOT do is attack.  If we do not defend against attacks, the system fails.  
Saying everyone is free to do what they want doesn't add any substance.  
* "Everyone is free to jump of a cliff", so what?  
* "Everyone is free to use BU", so what? The fact that one CAN run BU, doesn't make it any less of a stupid idea.  It doesn't mean we shouldn't try to explain to people why its a bad idea
Your argument is totally spurious
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:54:35


Lets forgive those who renege on the NYA and support those companies.
Many of the signatories were tricked, the NYA did not say the hardfork would be constructed in an irresponsible and dangerous way without strong replay protection and without strong wipe out protection for mobile wallets, therefore to some extent its not their fault.  I do not think many of the companies knew that.  
Actually even the [NYA]( itself linked to Sergio's [proposal]( and even he supported making the hardfork in a [responsible &amp; non aggressive  way]( therefore I do not think its fair to blame companies that much for signing.
Coming out and admitting to a mistake can be very difficult, I have the utmost respect for Wayniloans now and totally forgive them  
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:56:56


Exactly, so lets not assume anything..
 &gt; I think there is no choice for Segwit1x supporters. They can fork at the same time as well, add replay protection at the same time and go their own way if they really want
Right, but most people wont upgrade.  Many just will do nothing


You do not know the level of support....  But even if its 6.8%, so what?  Let the 6.8% follow their coin.
Don't you get it, the "6.8%" support the CURRENT rules, not Core!!!
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:35:01


I appreciate the tone here is a bit aggressive.  But please try to understand why people are so angry.  From their point of view you committed to a vital safety feature and now have abandoned that commitment and are pushing for an unnecessarily dangerous hardfork.  In my view it is correct to say you are not following the statement
If 2x coin really has strong majority support like you claim, after the hardfork it will be the majority hashrate and majority market cap coin, even if it adds strong 2 way replay protection.  However, those that choose not to follow should be respected.  There is no basis for your assumption that nobody will choose to continue to follow the existing rules.  **However, maybe you are right, maybe nobody will want to follow the original rules Bitcoin.  But perhaps a smart and modest person should prudently plan for scenarios in which they are wrong.** 
At the very least, I think you owe the community an explanation for changing your mind.
I am trying to continue dialog with you, as although I think your actions are hostile, I do not think you have hostile intent.  I kindly ask that you reconsider you decision to abandon your pledge to insist on strong 2 way replay protection.     
EDIT: When I say "follow the original rules Bitcoin" above, I mean the rules that existed pre hardfork, not rules going back to 2009
EDIT 2:  I am editing again since Erik changed his comment


BitGo did not sign the NYA


Not once in that essay is replay protection, something Erik committed to just 2 months earlier, mentioned.
Sergio, who is cited many times in that piece, now sees the need for replay protection. As he wisely said:


Source: 


Nobody is saying that.  What I am saying is that even several thousand people have a right to continue on the existing rules chain, should they choose to do so.  Add replay protection and press ahead with the upgrade.


The wording in that statement is clear.  is **literally twisting the words around, from  "consensus breaking IMPLEMENTATION" to "breaking consensus".**  The 2x client is a consensus breaking implementation.  The original statement clearly means breaking with the existing consensus rules, i.e. relaxing the rules, a hardfork.  Claiming otherwise is totally disingenuous.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:21:42
This is about demonstrating the community opposes 2x.  For my relay nodes I have added "No2x".  Does it help to use consistent capitalization of the "O" and "X" so we all club together in node ranking websites, or does that not make a difference?
Ironically, if it really comes down to it, the real way to demonstrate opposition to 2x is actually to run the 2x client in order to sell the 2x coins.
I run a 2x client for this purpose, as I tried to explain here (  Currently I do not have any 2x peers.
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:20:54




1. Why is it most beneficial to the minority?
2. You just said you like HF as it's opt in.  Replay protection is required to make it opt in 
3. how do you know which side is the minority?
4. The existing rules side cannot add replay protection anyway 
 


It is opt in.  Do you support opt in or coersion?


If a majority want new relaxed ruleset, they need to leave and create a new coin.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:36:01


Segwit2x is a hardfork....  These words are a bit confusing


You seen to be assuming that replay issues disproportionately negatively impact a minority hahsrate chain, compared to a majority hashrate one.  I do not know where this idea comes from or how it makes sense.  Please could you explain it to me?
As far as I can tell, broadly speaking, the negative consequences of replay impact both chains in an approximately equal negative fashion.
But even so, your argument is that hashrate should be hostile to a minority group of users?  Why should they be hostile rather than friendly.  Please stop with this aggressive hate.  If a minority wants to do something, let them.


Its not force.  If they want to opt in to the new coin, they can do.


Its ok to disagree, but that doesn't change the fact you are pushing ahead with destructive action.  Instead of just saying "we disagree", a more responsible attitude would be to carefully re-think and re-evaluate.  Are you at least doing that?
At least read my other response about Sergio.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:12:05
Seems you don't understand my point...
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:09:02


What would an attack look like then?
2x is grossly irresponsible:
1. 2x transactions are valid on the current chain and current chain transactions are valid on 2x.  Not only that but the 2x client broadcasts its transactions, by default, in the exactly the same way as the current clients, to the current peers.  This means that by default, users will lose fund
2. 2x does not have replay protection for mobile wallets. Many people use wallets like Breadwallet.  If 2x has the hashrate majority, then loses the majority and the current chain takes the lead, Breadwallet will switch chain.  That way if somebody received a payment, it could vanish from their wallet
2x is constructed in a dangerous and irresponsible way, such that it could cause chaos.  2x is constructed this way deliberately as a threat, i.e. "join us or we screw up the system".  In contrast it could be made in a friendly way, "please join us if you like".
I am sorry for being blunt, but I am calling it like it is, 2x is an attack.  Please can we stop deluding ourselves and admit that 
If 2x happens, ordinary users will have no idea what is going on and be totally confused.  They will lose funds and then generate anger towards Bitcoin.  Many users were confused and didnt know what to do when Bitcoin Cash happened.  Manually exporting keys from one wallet and importing to a Bitcoin Cash client was and is very difficult for many users.  2x will be far worse.  Despite this most of the community are complacent and just assume 2x will fail.  The only way it fails is if we fight against it.  Wake up people!
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:43:43


In contrast to you, I plan to patiently and conservatively sell my 2x coin.  Therefore the 2x side will be the minority.
The problem is your stupid insistance on causing mass destruction and loss of value in this process by refusing to add basic safety features, like strong replay protection, to your hardfork.  This makes you actively hostile to Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:42:48


Like Bitcoin Cash?  That had 5% miner support and remains viable, despite very stupid difficulty adjustment making it a joke
Or like ETC, which had tiny support when it launched
Please look at the evidence, a dedicated community is enough to keep a coin alive.  The "Core" supporters are the most dedicated and patient people in the space


Right, this subreddit represents the views of c2000 hard core Bitcoin supporters.  To be very generous, same with Then there are another c100,000 Bitcoin users and investors who have no idea what is going on and support neither.
The c2,000 here should be respected....  Just like the people with their coin (Bitcoin Cash)

* P2P network opposition (I have c200 peers, only 1 of which supports 2x)
Also it is possible for an idea to be inherently poor on merit, regardless of what other people think
If you think there are no user metrics, why not support strong replay protection?  Then let users and investors decide which coin is more valuable, without causing mass losses for third parties?
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:38:45


What do you mean?  Core developers **have** put forward safe hardfork plans....  See Johnson Lau's Spoonnet.  What is your problem with Spoonnet? 
However, many hardfork advocates are not rallying around this and instead keep supporting wave after wave of poorly implemented, dangerous and coercive hardforks
Erik, please leave the NYA and join the list of Spoonnet hardfork supporters, which includes Core developers  


Yes it's frustrating for all this time to pass.  But we need people to stop supporting these dangeous ideas like 2x/BU/XT ect.
Let's rally behind Spoonet.  Then once there is strong support, let's have a patient period of coding, review, analysis, testing, game theory analysis, criticism ect ect.  If rigorous standards are met and there is widespread agreement, then we roll out the upgrade.
The 2 years of frustration have been caused by companies supporting such dangerous hardforks meaning the community had to be on the defensive.  Remember how Coinbase, Xapo and Bitpay committed to run XT?  XT was a ridiculous idea locking in increases to 8GB blocks, giving the smaller block chain the asymmetric advantage and locking in 25% miner support for the smaller block chain. This was almost guaranteed to result in a total chain wipeout, as financial speculators would join the 25% of miners and make a huge profit wiping out the XT chain.  This proposal was almost optimally stupid. After people explained these problems, XT support from companies  stubbornly remained.  Then they supported Bitcoin Classic which had the same flaws. You brought up the last 2 years, but don't you think XT supporters like Coinbase deserve their share of the blame for all these delays, rather than who were forced on the defensive to protect the system and oppose XT/Classic by rallying behind the existing rules?  It's time these companies actually listened to experts when they explain how bad the hardforks they support are, then put an end to these dangerous ideas and start to support safe hardforks.
Please join me in the safe hardfork camp Erik.


Erik, this is a total misrepresentation of what is going on.  Firstly SegWit2x increases the blockweight from 4M to 8M!!  **Please can you stop spreading false information about people opposing 2MB blocks.  As this thread says, its about user sovereignty!!  Yet you keep causing confusion and division by claiming those that will never support 2x, do so because "2MB blocks".  This confuses large blockers into thinking people want 1MB forever and then drives the community apart.**  Please can you stop doing this.


Indeed.  But many users won't and instead will lose money.  Sure the few thousand people here reading this chat will split their coins, bu the hundreds of thousands of others will not.  Most people will just carry on using the wallets they are already using.  Please protect these users and stop taking action that will cause them loses.


This is not true.  Why do you keep repeating this?  Core do not control the protocol.  If Core proposed a rushed hardfork without strong replay protection, I would oppose it just as vigorously as I opposed XT/Classic/BU/2x.  This is not about personalities or teams, its about technical merit.  2x is flawed and dangerous based on technical merit regardless of which teams or personalities support it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:18:25


No they do not.  The side supporting the existing rules cannot add strong 2 way replay protection. You are spreading false information


This doesnt help if people do not upgrade


This is false.  The Core devs just added a brand new transaction format, called SegWit....
That is exactly what opt in replay protection is...
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:09:55
Exactly.  As a mobile wallet user you at least need the following:
* replay protection, such that transactions you send are valid on only one chain
* wipeout protection, such that your wallet sticks with one chain and doesn't see funds vanish and re appear
* Feature ensuring you follow the same chain as the one your transactions are valid on
2x does none of those things.  It's a terribly implemented hardfork.  I do not know what NYA signatories agreed to.  Any hardfork no matter how stupid?
And none of this has anything to do with, which coin is the true Bitcoin.  The market may decide that regardless, all the poor 2x implementation does is make the process messy  and massively destructive 
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:52:50
I totally agree that 2x is a pure attack.
Why do 2x people not oppose 2x and support better hardforks with new P2P magic, new address format, wipeout protection for light clients and strong 2 way replay protection? For example Core just rolled out new P2P magic and new transaction types, why on earth should the hardfork coin copy these things and cause problems for both sides? This applies whether the new coin is supposed to be "THE TRUE BITCOIN" or not. 2x is therefore clearly a hostile attack! 
Constructing hardforks in a dangerous and destructive way, like 2x is a lose lose situation, that will cause mass destruction of value. We all should oppose 2x. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:40:56
Please can you respond when you have time?
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:22:47
When forking away from Core, why refuse to add replay protection on the grounds wallets need to upgrade, when not even adding replay protection for the new transaction type Core just added that only newly upgraded wallets send?     
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:51:35
What did I avoid?
The NYA people can follow the NYA, add replay protetction and launch there new coin
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:32:35
Bitcoin Core 0.15 does disconnect from 2x clients, improving the 2x P2P network by ensuring better connections between peers.  However this is a relatively minor safety feature.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:28:40
Do you have 2x peers?
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:29:01
2x should also modify the block header to ensure light clients don't follow the 2x chain unless they upgrade to the new transaction format.  Otherwise light wallets could follow 2x, with their transactions being invalid on the 2x chain.
 
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:59:34
I will stick to the existing rules chain.  If 2x happens a lot of people will lose money
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:52:17
NYA does not kindly ask the community to opt it.  It's an ultimatum 
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:20:04
Based on block signalling Antpool and BTC.Top are running Bitcoin Unlimited.  Last I checked Bitcoin Unlimited has not implemented 2x
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:27:11


Erik.  The network has already upgraded to a 4 million unit weight limit, which means 2MB blocks.  Please can you stop constantly spreading misinformation?
Secondly, stop blaming Core.  If Core put forward a rushed and dangerous hardfork plan, for example without replay protection or without listening to people's technical concerns, the community would not upgrade to that new Core client either.
The community wants a patient safe hardfork, without any of these stupid threats/ultimatums.  Core cannot force a dangerous hardfork on the community any more than the NYA signatories can.
Erik, I read you blog again (  It ends on a friendly note:


The current NYA client clearly was not built with that peaceful philosophy in mind.  I strongly urge you to abandon the NYA and join me in the safe hardfork movement, with the "Please consider it" philosophy.  Lets do a HF and then kindly ask the community to opt in to our new token.  If we do that I am sure they will....
**Please let me know what is wrong with this 2nd friendly approach?**  So far you appear to be refusing to respond to this basic question.  Why do you think the community won't opt in if you do this friendly approach?
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:45:37
Bitcoin is not just some magic technology that is guaranteed to work.  In order for Bitcoin to work effectively, it needs an active community behind it, willing to defend it.  When people try to take irresponsible or hostile action, the community needs to fight against that. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:19:54
Probably not when all the Bitcoin transactions are replayed on it
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:47:54
oh, so like me you support the legacy chain, and run S2X to sell the coins?  Do you have any S2X peers?
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:54:17


But what about the SPV wallets that DO upgrade to Segwit? Those new transactions are valid on 2x and can be replayed on both chains. Why doesn't 2x ban these transactions?  
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:25:51
I can, but others will lose money, such that the system is damaged....
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:56:06
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:49:33
But I will not follow the new chain, as it doesn't share my philosophy, of never relaxing the rules on block validity unless there is widespread support across the entire community.  The same is true with many people.
I have the right not to follow that chain
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:25:28


1. Nobody knows which chain has "least consensus"
2. The existing rules chain cannot do so, all that would do is create a new coin
Also Core just added a brand new transaction format (one that require both a consensus rules change and all wallets to upgrade to use), called SegWit....  Despite this 2x copied this, and SegWit is valid on the 2x chain.  Therefore there is nothing Core can do, if Core adds new transaction formats, 2x may just copy it. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:10:28
Continuing as the same, on an existing coin, is not being irresponsible.
If someone launches a new coin, they should be responsible 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:53:39


In principal of course I agree that users are in control and support safe and patient UASFs
However, I strongly opposed BIP148 as it was rushed and dangerous. I made my position clear at the time.
Unfortunately the community were angry and could not be stopped.
However, a hardfork like 2x is much more dangerous than a rushed dangerous softfork like BIP148
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:28:05
How could I do that?  Could I use Bitcoin Core?
My plan was to do the following:
1. Run both Core and SegWit2x clients &amp; get my cold wallets ready
2. Wait for the last common block between 2x and the original rules chain
3. As soon as one of the chains gets the next block, whichever chain it is, send an nlock time transaction of the chain in the lead to myself. If that gets confirmed first, then try to move my coins in the lower proof of work chain also to myself (If this doesn't work, try again)
4.  Once successfully split, start sending my 2x coins to exchanges
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:18:59
Thanks 
I am also on mobile.
I kindly ask for you to try to re evaluate the decision to support a hardfork without strong  replay protection, objectively based on the evidence available.
Please try to ignore the rudeness and the politics and be objective. Please remember that we can all be wrong at times and it's often important to mitigate risks as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:50:31


2x is clearly a hostile move, they do not add replay protection so that users lose funds.  This is a threat, basically saying back us or we cause chaos.  Instead they should add strong replay protection and kindly ask users to voluntarily join them, if they want to
I am sorry to disappoint you, but Bitcoin is not a perfect technology, it can be attacked.  The only way for the system to work is if users defend against these attacks
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:07:12


What about a SF that bans an error, where one could steal somebody else's money?  Is that coercive?
It depends on the type of softfork...
But I agree this is a problem. Sidechains are supposed to mitigate this.  If miners do an unpopular softfork, the community can move to a sidechain.  Not sure what solution you propose to this problem?


Sure, but them replay protection is needed, to ensure users do not lose funds and have to actively decide to opt in.  You cant claim its opt in and at the same time claim the old chain will be destroyed.


Yes, that is a weakness.  I have the sidechain idea, which is a way to mitigate the weakness in the long term.  What idea do you propose


Who is suggesting that?
Core did a blocksize increase to 2MB, exactly what the large blockers (Bitcoin Classic) wanted.
But in general, if people want to stick with a smaller block chain, they should have the right to do so.  We need to stop trying to force people into things.  If someone wants larger blocks, fine, fork away with replay protection.  If someone wants the current rules, fine let them have the current rules.
Lets stop trying to be hostile and force people into things.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:54:23


Exactly.  Bitcoin is much larger than in 2011.  The 2x upgrade model may have worked then, but now the ecosystem is much larger.  No matter how large the % support is for the new coin, there will always be some people wanting to use and invest in "original Bitcoin".  With Bitcoin at this scale, it is not responsible to do a hardfork without strong 2 way replay protection, regardless of the level of support.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:56:48
That is not my point.  My point is what about the wallets that have/do upgrade to Segwit...  The transactions these new upgraded wallets send are valid on both chains and can be replayed.  That is the hypocrisy from 2x.  2x should ban those new format transactions  
You are forking away from Core, you refuse to add replay protection and you even copy the brand new transaction format just added by Core...  Why?  That makes no sense, other than hostility. 
Do you understand the hypocrisy now?
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:20:29
Exactly.  And that is precisely why the split needs basic safety features.
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:32:39

Please stop misrepresentation by claiming these features are not required for a Bitcoin upgrade but only a new alt spinoff.  
Besides users will decide which coin is Bitcoin, not the intention of the proponents of 2x.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:27:12


I'm pretty sure it is quite complex. Certainly if they want to to the hardfork in a responsible way
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:18:50
What advantages do 2x get from making this change, from their point of view?   
I can't work it out.  Does this improve peering in any way?
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:59:09


Right.  And if SegWit was activated earlier (e.g. November 2016) we could have 2MB blocks by now.  We could be weeks away from the activation of Schnorr signatures giving us c3MB equivalent capacity.
However, high fees are not the largest problem right now.  The largest problem for Bitcoin is people trying to increase capacity, by hardforking in dangerous confrontational ways.  We need to make that threat insignificant by explaining that the core property of the system is that the rules cannot be relaxed using confrontational means, otherwise Bitcoin's monetary supply cap is effectively meaningless and Bitcoin will have limited value.  In my view it is inevitable that if Bitcoin succeeds, that at some point in the future, there will be massive pressure to do a contentious hardfork to increase the supply of Bitcoin.  We must therefore be resilient against a confrontational hardfork, at all costs.
Once we have decisively addressed the above point, by preventing a contentious hardfork, we can move on to focusing all our efforts on another large issue, the high transaction fees.  Luckily for now fees are falling, but I agree they could go up at any time.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:38:26

Are you running Core, or have you not thought all of this through properly?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:55:41
The contract includes terms to protect B2X investors in the unlikely event that Core merges a hardfork to support B2X 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:41:04


Ok, but my concern is how to find such a web interface with good 2x peering?  If I have my own node, I can try and get the best peering.  My experience with Bitcoin Cash at the very start was to keep re-broadcasting the transaction again and again


I do not want to do this.  I am not sure if that will have as much impact on price post fork, which is what my main objective is here
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:37:16
Why not add replay protection then?
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:50:17


Nonsense.  If it has the majority is still does need replay protection.
Also making such an assumption is arrogant
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:44:25
Notice how Jeff refuses to add strong replay protection, but does make an exact copy of Core's brand new transaction type....  How is that not hypocrisy?

Given the lack of replay protection, I do not think this will be peaceful at all.  Even at 5% of Bitcoin's market cap, that is pretty big nowadays.  B2X may be around causing a mess for users and businesses for years.

@_date: 2017-09-23 08:11:16
it's hostile to all users by not adding replay protection
We measure the majority by adding replay protection and then seeing if the majority of users and investors opt into the new coin   
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:28:07


Who cares anymore?  I do not care how substantial support for 2x is or not.  The safety features should be added regardless.  Even those who believe 2x support is very strong, should be modest and prudent enough to appreciate that they could be wrong and take the necessary safety precautions.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:44:43
After all your time in Bitcoin, you are supporting what many believe to be an attack on the system.  Please an you at least do us the respect of responding to our comments and defending your aggressive position against the coin I want to use, by refusing to add strong 2 way replay protection.
If you will not even engage in discussion and debate, because deep down you know your position is totally untenable, do you not see why many call you an attacker?
Please respond...  Or at least respect my right to continue to use the coin I want, if you want to safely launch a new coin, please do so, and let people chose to opt in.
What you are doing is unethical.
Many thanks
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:16:36


Please can you withdraw your misleading remark that Core devs are not proposing hardforks?  This causes division


I have been pushing it for ages now.  Please can you join me and stop pushing hardforks without key safety features?


What do you mean there is not time left?  You are saying that people are so angry they would rather screw the system up than do a safe hardfork?


No.  As I explaiend I do not care one jot about Core.  I judge ideas on merit.  If Core put forward a hardfork I thought was dangerous, I would argue against it just as vigorously.  Actually in 2013 to 2015 I had a strong bias in favor of Gavin.  Despite this I did not support XT, as I considered it a bad idea on merit.


Firstly, as it happens, I think the Core developers like Cory Fields, Johnson Lau and Pieter Wuille are some of the calmest, kindest and most modest people I have ever met.  Perhaps their views and attitudes have been misrepresented, in a malicious attempt to achive some nefarious means.  But perhaps not.  I don't know.
However, you have personally contributed to spreading false information about Core:
* You claim Core has not put forward any hardfork proposals, when they have (e.g. Spoonnet, BIP103).  This contributes to the division
* You claim SegWit is not a blocksize increase and you want an increase to 2MB, when SegWit is already an increase to 2MB.  This contributes to the division
* You claim Core have been stalling for 2 years and have "done little".  When actually Core successfully rolled out a blocksize limit increase with SegWit, fixed the quadratic scaling of sighash operations with SegWit,  improved signature verification to speed up scaling speeds by 7x, re-engineered the database to improve sync speeds by c2x, implemented pruned mode, compact blocks, CPFP  ect ect ect.  I could go on and on and name tens of large scalability enhancements.  If it wasn't for them, Bitcoin may not be working at all right now as it may be unable to handle the traffic.  Its a little disrespectful to claim they have done little
But fine, lets assume the Core devs are nasty people.  Lets assume they are toxic and have done nothing for businesses but "have done little but insult their intentions, their talent, and their role in the ecosystem".  If that is the case, please do the following:
* Do not use the code they have written, if you hate them so much.  Re implement Bitcoin and use that. 
* Or if you hate them even more and do not want to be on the same chain as them, re-implement a new coin with Bitcoin's UTXO and call that Bitcoin, just do it safely with replay protection ect
It sounds like you hate Core so much, you have a vindictive agenda, with the goal of punishing Core rather than helping Bitcoin.
Regardless of what you think of Core, there is no excuse for doing a dangerous hardfork without replay protection.
If Core is hated so much, why does 2x copy:
* The p2p magic Core built
* The new transaction formats Core built
* SegWit that Core built
Exactly copying these new Core features, contributes to the chaos of a dangerous hardfork. 
One more thing, I have noticed what you said above: 


Are you sure you have thought all the game theory through here?  You do realize that 2x does not provide mobile wallets wipeout protection right.  This leaves the option open to hostile users to attack mobile wallet users.  One could split their coins, send a mobile wallet user 2x coin, then **help the market** to decide to reject to 2x and the mobile wallet user will see the coins vanish from their wallet.
This is an unnecessarily dangerous way to do the hardfork.  Actually if 2x initially has the majority hashrate support, but the original chain has the market support, refusing to add mobile wallet wipe-out protection gives an advantage to the "toxic" Core side, since attackers may be incentivsed to support Core.
Please carefully think through the game theory and implications of 2x's stubborn refusal to implement safety features.  Are you sure you have thought them all through?
Once you have, I am confident you will decide to join me in the safe hardfork camp.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:26:49
I hope Core would not do something as irresponsible as that.  A hardfork requires, testing, review, preparation, new transaction format, new address format, long grace period, a modification to the block header, new p2p network ect ect
I would hope Core would do effort and make a strong robust hardfork, otherwise they would demonstrate total incompetence by not learning any lessons over the last few years.
Hopefully the community would reject a dangerous and stupid hardfork no matter who supports it, including Satoshi

@_date: 2017-10-26 01:26:08
The best thing you can do to help, is to meet the remaining NYA signatories in person and explain to them the issues and problems with B2X. Face to face meetings are far more effective than Reddit or Twitter
A list of the remaining signatories can be found here:
Look through the list and see which company is closest to your location. Then send them a polite email or give them a polite call. Ask to meet them for coffee, beers or dinner to discuss your concerns with B2X. Not just the CEO, junior employees are also important. The more you can speak to them and educate them, the more they will be able to educate their colleagues.
The dangerous hardfork campaign has mostly been about well financed face to face lobbying. 
Dangerous hardfork advocates have been flying around the world meeting companies and asking for support for their dangerous hardfork proposals. We need to do the same, in a more distributed way, in support of safe hardforks.

There are only 56 signatories not over 80.  Stop spreading misinformation

33 of the 56, that's 59%, are  Digital Currency Group portfolio companies.  This is the organisation that orgnaised the event

Neither.  Please stop this false and misleading narrative, which contributes to the division you complain about, that is not how Bitcoin works.  By framing this situation in this false way, you contribute to the antagonism of group A vs group B competing for power. 
Bitcoin is defined by the rules on block validity and within that rule-set, the most work chain.  The 2nd part, the most work part, is decided by miners.
Nobody, including developers or miners, can relax the rules on block validity (hardfork).  **Relaxing** the rules requires widespread support across the **ENTIRE community of USERS.** 
This characteristic is what makes Bitcoin unique.  Only individual end users can relax the rules of the system.  That is what gives Bitcoin users "financial sovereignty", which is the whole point of Bitcoin.
However, unfortunately, miners may be able to **tighten** the rules (a softfork), without user support.  They cannot do this for a hardfork.

Why wouldn't reneging on such a policy do more damage, relatively speaking, to B2X compared to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:42:29


That would simply create a new coin.  There is no reason to assume people would follow that 3rd new coin.
Many people want to support the current rules token
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:32:33


Two wrongs don't make a right, I opposed BIP148.  However Segwit is a softfork, if such threats work for a hardfork I am not interested in Bitcoin


Firstly we already have a larger blocksize limit with segwit, we have now moved on to block weight 
Secondally, they are NOT **asking** for larger blocks, they are demanding it with threats!  If they actually did kindly ask, I would immediately respond by saying "absolutely yes".


No they did not!  Please read it


So you are wrong on two counts.  Firstly it's 4MB not 2MB, since we already have 2MB.  Secondally it is only if there is broad support across the entire community.  Miners breached that by aggressively pushing for dangerous hardforks without such broad support like Bitcoin Unlimited or 2x ect.
Once miners actually honour the HK agreement and commit once again to only support a hardfork with the broad support across the entire community, we can actually safely hardfork.
        
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:50:13
I honestly don't know, I'm just asking 
Same with the B2X plan to mask their nodes, it also seems self destructive, but I'm not sure
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:15:00
Sorry I do not understand....
The B2X futures price represents the future price of B2X, including the probability it totally fails and is worth zero, just like all futures contracts.
I would love to buy Bitcoin futures, that excluded the possibility of Bitcoin failing.  I would also like to buy futures in Footlocker or Exxon, that excluded the chance of Footlocker or Exxon failing.  Such a thing does not exist in normal investing (except with maybe credit default swaps or something).  By investing in something, you take a risk as to whether it fails or not. The same is true with everything, including B2X.
@_date: 2015-04-02 00:43:08
Yep.  See my comment on just how unlikely it is that Bank Of America (BoA) will be a customer above.  Why would BoA even need a hash in every block, once a week should be fine?
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:28:21
I, and I am sure almost anyone would be happy for a patient sensible hardfork blocksize increase, for example Spoonnet.
However, I would absolutely oppose any hardfork that is a result of a bargain to end these dangerous hardfork attacks.  We must never give in to threats and do a hardfork as a result, otherwise the Bitcoin rules are not robust and the 21 million cap will eventually be breached.
In summary:
* Yes to a safe hardfork increase in block weight
* No to any hardfork as a result of bargains, attacks must cease unconditionally    
You can claim this is not how the real world normally works, but isn't the points of  Bitcoin to be something different?

And after they spend the $100m, will we then be able to use the chain we want?
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:06:07
We should not get complacent.  Yes many companies oppose 2x, but how do you think we got there?  This was because of community concern.  Bitcoin is not some perfect technology that just works, it needs a community to defend it.
We need to keep defending the system against these threats and not become complacent after each minor victory. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:14:40


Right, so it doesn't disproportionately impact either, which was my point


Investors and traders decide the market cap.
Not sure 2x has greater exchange support
But maybe I am wrong.  Who cares... Lets add replay protection and let the games begin


I have never made such an arrogant claim.  Each side should just accept that they could be wrong and do the split.


At this point, I agree


But doesnt it depend on the type of softfork.  Some can be bad (e.g. freezing funds) and some can be a very miner opt in upgrade
Also, if someone wants to take hostile action and freeze funds via a softfork, not sure how telling them "do a hardfork with strong replay protection instead", will help much

A website or online platform is great at publishing.  Take Google Mail for example.  This is backed up multiple times on many servers worldwide.  I don't ever remember Google losing data.  I also have no recollection of a scandal where Google tampered with historic email records?  Do you remember any such event?  Twitter is another great publishing tool, BoA can just tweet  each week.  This will be simple, accessible and Twitter is already robust against most attacks.  Twitter are not taking any "responsibility", they are just offering their normal service.


They are not taking responsibility for anything, they are merely storing hashes.  If I back up my mortgage on Google Drive and then have a dispute with the bank that ends up in court, I can download the document from Google Drive and use it as evidence.  Google are not taking responsibility for anything, they are just hosting files.
Of course Bitcoin's blockchain is technically better and more secure, however that level of security is necessary in a tiny minority of cases.  In these cases, as I keep repeating, Bitcoin will be fine.  Are you actually claiming BoA cannot afford to put a hash in the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:12:37
Yes databases are faster.  Yes of course databases can use timestamps.  Have you ever seen or used a database?
Are they encrypted?  Bitcoin does not use encryption, but databases are much more flexible than blockchains, so they could use this.
Have you read anything I have said?  Private blockchains with mining make no sense!!!  Mining only helps an attacker, it doesnt improve security in a Private Blockchain.
I cannot believe you mention the 3 days again!  This delay is due to legacy legal and regulatory issues, not technological factors.  Please let me know you understand this now?

I read this again.
Firstly, the article makes no mention of why strong replay protection does not need to be included, something you committed to a few months prior to this.  It is unreasonable now to suddenly start abandoning replay protection.  
Indeed, doesn't Sergio, who you cited many times in that piece, now sees the need for replay protection.  As he wisely said:

Finally, your article ends as follows:  


I think that is a great way to end, and is the right approach.  It highlights it's a proposal and not an aggressive act attempting to force others.  This tone is missing from the NYA itself 
If you ask people to consider a proposal, I kindly ask that you listen to and carefully consider the feedback, rather than pushing ahead regardless.
At least listen to Sergio, the guy who made the proposal

Please can you explain how Factom creates "one system of record".  Why cant BoA upload multiple records into Factom from multiple accounts, just like any other database?


The bank has the master "system of record".  If someone wants to verify this record, they keep their own local copy and then compare it to the banks.


Why cant this work across multiple systems?  Each bank publishes the hash on their own websites.  Anyone is then free to backup the hashes.  People who care about BoA will check the BoA website and people who care about JP Morgan will check the JP Morgan website?


What is the problem with records changing hands? Twitter, Facebook, the New York Times and Google cross many boundaries and one can reliably publish the hash on these websites or platforms.  **Anyone can offer a simple service very easily, a website with an API that just publishes a list of hashes.  Anyone can then run a script to check the website never makes changes.**


When bank A publishes the hash on Factom how does Bank B know its the right one?


Why are many signatures required.  The bank and customer need to sign, that is it.  The bank and customer then need to sign any changes.  Why would the signature of a third party help?


Please respond to this last point..

That is wrong, ECDSA signatures are required to be valid in BIP101.  A 1MB limit is still valid under BIP101.
BIP100 does not give miners more power to keep the limit lower than any other option.
Its like giving a group of junkies, with an unlimited supply of blow, an open framework to vote for restrictions on blow usage.  Of course there are many ways to end addiction, BIP100 is just a tool they could use, it doesnt increase junky power as they could stop anyway.

You have not shown me how banks can benefit from blockchains.  I have explained to you that these banks should just use better databases.
Think of the following analogy:
You live 5km from school and there is a straight road between you and the school.  You walk everyday and want to save time using technology.  The airplane has just been invented, its a marvel of enginering and science and we are all very excited and keen to use it.  You propose flying to school everyday.  Despite my shared excitment, I am trying to explain to you that it is actually more effective to use a car.  An airplane is only effective over longer distances or to pass obsticals.
In the same way blockchains are only effective when the system is permissionless, which is not what banks want.  Applying blockchains to permissioned situations is a classic example of over enginering and not effective.

Beayeteebeyubebeelwy, I agree with you on this.  I could be wrong, but I think that services like Factom are extremely unlikely to have a significant use case.  Let’s consider one area I have heard mentioned as a potential use case, which I think is a bit ridiculous.  Apparently Bank of America could use Factom to prevent mortgage fraud, by hashing all the new mortgage documents and securing them somehow using Factom to prove to people no fraud was committed, this would of course prevent a global financial crisis like in 2008.
Here are a proposed list of potential alternative, more simple, solutions:
*	Solution 1 - Bank of America provide their customers the documents directly, at the time the contracts were signed, such that the customer has proof of the mortgage document.
*What if the customer loses the document?*
*	Solution 2 - Bank of America uses a trusted third party to store a backup of the documents in a centralized database?
*But trusted third parties can become corrupt?*
*	Solution 3 - Bank of America sends the documents to multiple trusted third parties.
*But multiple third parties can become corrupt and it’s not publicly cryptographically secure, which would prove to everyone there is no fraud.  "Why should we have to trust anyone?" I hear their customers demanding*
*	Solution 4 - Bank of America uses hash functions, a basic cryptographic technique that a tiny minority of their customers understand.  Every week the bank publishes a hash of their mortgage database on their website?
*But why do we have to trust their website as they could alter the records?*
*	Solution 5 - Don’t worry, Bank of America will respond to the demands of an even smaller minority of their customers and publish the hash, every week, using the following mechanisms:
a.	The bank sends an email to its customers with the hash
b.	The bank tweets the hash
c.	The bank takes out a small advert in a national newspaper a prints the hash in the newspaper each week
d.	The bank uploads the hash as a torrent file on the pirate bay
e.	The bank puts it on pastebin
f.	The bank posts a letter containing the hash to customers
g.	The bank engraves the hash on a five metal plates, they send one to China, hide one in the desert, put one at the bottom of the ocean, send the one up into space in orbit and send one into outer space like Voyager.
*What if the US government, the bank and the Chinese collude together to commit fraud?  What if they pass a law to burn all the newspapers with the hash, delete all the emails using super NSA technology and send the cops round to your house and burn your copies of the letter?  What if they recover the metal plate from the bottom of the ocean, dig up the one in the desert, shoot down the one in orbit and send a recovery mission for the other one?  What if they take down all the torrents and make twitter corrupt?  Then the bank destroy all back ups anyone has made of the tweets? This is course will be easy, as we know suppressing a short piece of text on the internet is very simple and always successful.*
*	Solution 6 - The bank put a hash of the mortgage database in the bitcoin blockchain each week.
*What happens when bitcoin becomes so expensive that a giant global banking conglomerate cant afford to put one transaction into the blockchain a week, because its prohibitively expensive, but somehow still used by ordinary people?*
*	Solution 7 - Simple, Bank of America uses Factom, to secure its mortgage documents.

Thanks for your kind and helpful responses. 
Would it be possible for a large company like a bank to integrate Factom into document creation?  Such that each document has the date in the corner, where Factom proves the document was not produced in the future and a  hash of the previous bitcoin block header proves it didn't take place in the past?
I can see that this might be a good idea and make the old scheme of printing a date without any proof seem laughable.

You have mentioned various reasons for supporting the NYA.  Please can you now respond to why you abandoned your previous commitment to insist on strong replay protection?  Demanding strong replay protection  does not breach the NYA.

The best thing you can do to help, is to meet the remaining NYA signatories in person and explain to them the issues and problems with B2X.  Face to face meetings are far more effective than Reddit or Twitter
A list of the remaining signatories can be found here:
Look through the list and see which company is closest to your location.  Then send them a polite email or give them a polite call.  Ask to meet them for coffee, beers or dinner to discuss your concerns with B2X.  Not just the CEO, junior employees are also important.  The more you can speak to them and educate them, the more they will be able to educate their colleagues.
The dangerous hardfork campaign has mostly been about well financed face to face lobbying.

Please can you explain the difference between a permissioned blockchain and a database?  I never could work that out.
A blockchain is a database without permission being required to create entries.
Blockchain = database - permission
Rearranged (by adding permission to both sides):
Permissioned Blockchain = Blockchain + permission = database
That is not say banks cant make databases better and faster, or use more merkle roots and hashing.  It just has nothing to do with blockchains.
EDIT:  I now understand the confusion.  Some people seem to think the slow banking system is due to some flaw in the fundemental principles behind databases, it isn't.  Let me explain:
* Database: very fast confirmation
* Blockchain: slow confirmation
* Banks: very slow confirmation **(due to legacy issues, not a fundemental problem with databases)**  these legacy issues can be solved using databases.
Do you guys get it now?

Ok.  I do not see how that is any different from a database.
How will the blockchain help with faster transactions?  That is like adding an 80 meter wing span to a car to make it corner better.  The only possible thing I can see is this slowing transactions down.
Why would this help shorten confirmation times?  I think I know the confusion now, people seem to completly misunderstand databases.
 * Database: very fast confirmation
 * Blockchain: slow confirmation
 * Banks: very slow confirmation **(due to legacy issues, not a fundemental problem with databases)**

It would be far faster, cheaper, more simple, more secure, easier to implement and logical, that the banks club together and make one central database, in a new entity, to do this.

I will happily support XT if it has a fixed 8MB limit.  I may even run a node.  Unfortunately XT commits to 8GB blocks.  Maybe some people support XT because they think its only 8MB.

51% of miners already have the power to reject blocks they dont like if they collaborate in private.  BIP100 is an open framework, where 80% of miners can change what kind of blocks the mining industry accsepts.  Please note that 80% &gt; 50%.
Therefore, under BIP100 users dont give any more power to miners than they already have.  We just provide a framework or toolkit to miners, to help encourage them not to from a secret mining cartel, that could do what it likes to block sizes.

@_date: 2015-09-06 23:45:40
Using a 50% voting level gives miners too much power.  Requiring 80% votes for any change prevents miners having too much power.
@_date: 2015-09-06 23:42:51
I said BIP100 does not give miners more power to lower the limit, not increase it.  This statement is true because under BIP100 80% can lower the limit, whilst with any proposal, 51% can always lower the limit and all nodes will accsept these blocks as valid.
@_date: 2015-09-06 22:42:39
How can you say there is nothing wrong with BIP101?  This is a complex and difficult issue, at the same time there are many clever and interesting proposals out there.  However no proposal is perfect and each has many problems.
For example, I support BIP100, but I accsept there is plenty wrong with it.

Please explain why it would make economic non technical sense to vote for smaller blocks now?
We always have a problem of miner short term vs long term intests.  BIP100 exists to mitigate this problem.
 &gt; so long term miner profits are zero
Please explain what you mean here by the word miner?  Do you mean each individual miner or the industy as a whole?  Remember each miner is different and may have different costs.  Some miners may have relitively stable long term profits driven by strong managment teams, for example.
If anyone can enter and exit the mining industry.  What you can assume, over a certain timeframe, is that the costs of the most marginal miner is equal to marginal costs.  Therefore the profits of the most marginal miner or highest cost miner, should be zero.
However it is possible in some unlikely scenarios that a lower Bitcoin price could benefit some miners, if the industry cost curve has a certain shape.  This is why in the very long term the voting period may need to increase as a mitigation strategy.

In general an increase in supply results in a reduction in price, in that sense one could argue assuming this doesnt occur could be "retarded".
The theory of prices being unaffected by supply is called "Perfectly elastic demand".
This theory only really works if the price of something is very low or zero, such that it is insignificant for consumers.  These good are typically said to have very low utility.
This essentially means fees fall to zero.  Which is what many people with a cautious stance on the blocksize have been saying.

Ok this is the most basic argument I can think of, as to why BIP101 is not perfect.
How long does it take to download 8GB?  Lets say you are a miner and have a very fast 1Gb per second connection operating at 100% capacity and totally focused on Bitcoin.  At this speed it would still take 64 seconds to download a full block.  The target block time is 600 seconds, therefore the headstart for other miners could be on average 64/600 &gt; 10%.  This could mean profit margins fall 10%.  In an indusrty with low margins, often below 10%, therefore this could be very sigificant.
Do you see why this could be a problem?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:29:10

I am sorry, this makes absolutely no sense to me.  That is still just a database.  Databases are much faster and more secure than blockchains.
Its like saying "grounded aircraft" is a great idea, because it has the speed and security of an aircraft but works on the ground.  A grounded aircraft is still a car!  You say there will still be mining, that is like adding large wings to the car to help it fit through narrow streets.  It offers nothing but adds a huge amount of cost and complexity.
Aircraft = car + flight
Rearranged (by subtracting flight from both sides
Grounded Aircraft = aircraft - flight = car

As you can see its not a 1MB forever vision.  It is a vision for large onchain capacity expansion.  There is just a slight difference of opinion with respect to timing.


This is not recent.  Core developers have been talking about a soft-hardfork for ages.  I have been advocating it for a while to.   **I think its a great idea**, with a 95% threshold and sufficient grace periods of course.

Bitcoin does not use encryption anywhere in the protocol, it uses digital signatures and hash functions, which are other related cryptographic concepts, but not encryption.  Databases can easily use all these cryptographic techniques and many of them do.
The delays are due to the legacy architecture of the system, which was designed when everything was done on paper.  This is why it takes so long.  A lack of competition and tight regulation has meant that financial institutions were very slow to move into the digital age.  Yes blockchains may be slightly better than the old system designed for paper, but that is not relevant, because a whole range of modern database solutions are available.  Blockchains are a particularly bad choice for many reasons.  Blockchains are extremely complicated, slow, have scaling issues, difficult to implement, have few experts available for hire, are unproven, expensive and are vulnerable from a security perspective.  Why on earth would a financial institution choose this option over a database?
**Explain why banks and Blythe are interested**  
This is the classic "Argument from authority" fallacy (  Firstly Banks and Blythe are not experts on Blockchains, they probably do not understand it and just thinks it sounds cool or is geeky.  The banks are starting to realize this now anyway and are moving away from Blockchains.  Banks are now focusing on and investigating better databases, more integration between systems and better use of digital signatures.  In around 12 to 18 months banks would have worked this out.  As for Blythe, maybe its part PR to make her project sound better to banks and part misunderstanding.

Yes.  If it was proposed in a calm, patient, prudent, collaborative, non confrontational and respectful way, while being open minded and listening  to peoples concerns, then yes of course.  See BIP103 for example.
I think many Bitcoin Classic opponents really disliked the implementation methodology and aggressive nature of the proposal, which made it unviable.  I think everyone is fine with 2MB itself.   Hardforking becomes very difficult in a confrontational environment.  That is simply the practicality of it.
@_date: 2015-09-06 20:18:56
That is not correct.  80% approval is required for a change in either direction, up or down.
In your example 4MB would remain as the limit.
For example, vote = {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 8} would be result in a fall to 3MB, from 4MB
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:17:00
I agree, we should be skeptical and require a high bar.  That is why it would be better to analyse BIP100 over several years.  However some people are aggresivly pushing for quick changes.  This is a huge shame, it may mean we need to implement BIP100 without enough analysis.
Also that image is wrong:
BIP101 has aggresive exponential growth, yet in the image its a straight line.

Exactly, Microsoft stops people giving their software away for free by using the fact that doing so is illegal.  Only Microsoft and organisations it authorises can sell the software, or they may need to face Law enforcement.  There is no law or law enforcement agency preventing people from producing bitcoin blocks and adding transactions into it.  Therefore in a competitive environment the price will fall to the marginal cost.  As technology improves this marginal cost could be near zero.

Yes maybe you are right.  But after all this time, to see a miner with 10% of the global hashrate, mine BU, which as far as I can tell isn't even convergent with itself and most of its proponents do not even seem to think BU nodes converging on one chain matters, I am quite pessimistic.
@_date: 2015-09-06 23:03:18
A blocksize limit of 1MB is a subset of rules BIP101 nodes are already ok with.  51% of miners could impose this 1MB limit rule on the network by refusing to build on blocks over 1MB.
Strictly speaking, BIP100 does not give miners more power to lower the limit compared to the current status quo 1MB or compared to BIP101.  It does give miners more power to increase the limit.
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:51:00


BU does not always follow the longest chain of hashes.
* BU does not enforce the blocksize limit, but still enforces other rules.  For example if there is a longer chain with a 100BTC reward, BU will not follow
* BU actually has a default value of 4 blocks, whereby it accepts a chain of any blocksize as long it has a lead of 4 over another chain.  When the lead is 3 it follows a shorter chain before jumping 4 blocks.  That is not the longest chain

I am not sure I follow you here.  I am not advocating "issuing all types of valuable assets on top of these services".  The Bitcoin blocktain is a phenomenal technological breakthrough that allows large group of people, who not not trust each other, to have consensus about the state of a database.  This property enables the issuance of assets on Bitcoin blockchain.  In order to prove a document existed at a point in time, to a reasonable standard of certainty, we do not necessarily require this high level of consensus.  I am not advocating that we run the banking system on Google Mail. 
Google Mail is likely to be sufficient, to store data when we don't require extremely strong consensus.  BoA can email the hash to a mailing list each week, to anyone who wants to receive it and the users can store it on their mail servers.  This is likely to be sufficient enough to prevent BoA tampering with the records, otherwise it will be evident to the world.  This does not make mail servers crucial system critical elements of the system, as the level of redundancy is extremely high.  If BoA tampers with the records anyone can publish the email headers and the email proving the anomaly and BoA will lose all their integrity.

This is a conservative assumption, I do not really like it but Peter R insists on it.  The less exponential the worse the outcome.  If the relationship is linear then orphan risk cost is almost equal to fees, as the chart shows.  I think it could be more linear than many people think.  Obviously sub linear would be a complete distaster and perhaps result in zero fees.

It could be done that way I guess.  Just have a rule that the sum of witness and non witness data is less than 1MB. Many people just want a capacity increase.
Combining it with a blocksize limit increase the way it was done, makes SegWit transactions cheaper, which incentivses usage.  This encourages people to use non malleable transactions with linear sighash scaling, which is a positive

What I mean by "false flag", is flagging support for a fork, without actually enforcing the rules of the fork.  For example "Not BitcoinXT" (
This normally has two objectives:
1. To attack clients which actually do support the fork, by "tricking" them so that they trigger early, such that they are booted off the network or their blocks are orphaned
2. To cause confusion about the signaling mechanism, preventing activation due to uncertainty
In my view the above is unethical.  BU had a "false flag" for BIP109, by flagging support for BIP109 rules but not enforcing then, however apparently there was no malicious intent.

There are many examples of off chain solutions.

Eventually, when the block rewards is low, we may need a permanent stock of transactions in the memepool.  Otherwise there may be no incentive for miners to move forward and they may just keep trying to orphan a previous block to capture the fees.  For now I would support a moderate blocksize increase to address the current demand, however I do not support an excessive 8,000x increase like BIP101, which could create problems in the future.  Did you know the block reward may fall as low as 0.39BTC in the BIP101 period?
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:53:34
Here is an earlier comment I made, with assumptions.
I am suggesting orphan risk cost will be significant in relation to fee revenue. I agree that fee revenue will be greater than orphan risk cost, but my argument is that it will be a significant percentage, which is a huge problem. I have not decided if I agree with Greg Maxwell’s idea that fees will therefore not contribute to security, I think he may be right in some circumstances. However that is not the main point to my argument.
I have constructed my own image (link below) to try to illustrate my thinking. In my diagram the orange area represents orphan risk costs, while fee revenue is represented by the orange and yellow area. As can be seen the orange area is significant in relation to the yellow area, which I think is a large issue, which could cause a catastrophic failure of the system. This guarantees that orphan risk costs is significant in relation to the industry size, and therefore incentivises a high level of mining centralisation.
The green lines cross where marginal orphan risk cost of a transaction is equal to the fee. The miner then chooses to make a blocksize where the lines cross. Each user is aware of this and therefore keeps increasing the fee, as time passes, to ensure their transaction is on the left of this point. As can be seen the “profit” or yellow area is not an order of magnitude larger than the orange area.
The chart makes the following assumptions:
1. The underlying assumption is that users and wallets are operate a mature environment and engage in sophisticated strategies to ensure they pay the lowest possible fee.
2. User wallets analyse the memory pool, have good knowledge about orphan costs and even construct live dummy blocks every few seconds in order to determine the lowest possible fee which ensures the transaction makes it into the next block. Wallets regularly automatically increase the fee as the memory pool grows, to ensure the transaction is likely to get into the block.
3. The block reward is low and insignificant. This is a reasonable assumption as the block reward declines exponentially over time and I am looking at this problem from the perspective of Satoshi’s vision of fully incentivising miners from fees.
4. Uniform orphan risk across the industry. This assumption is likely to be false, however this makes the analysis more simple and I am not sure it affects the conclusion.
5. Only one round is considered. Due to the inability to decrease fees, if a block is found quickly the miner can include higher fee transactions that did not make it into the previous block. This is likely to have a material impact on the analysis. However I do not think the conclusion will be impacted, since this may only be relevant if a block is found in less than 10 minutes and the cases in which this does not occur are likely to be significant.
6. I assume orphan risk increases exponentially as the blocksize increases.  This is the key variable that impacts the severity of the issue

Think of the following analogy:
You live 5km from school and there is a straight road between you and the school. You walk everyday and want to save time using technology. The airplane has just been invented, its a marvel of enginering and science and we are all very excited and keen to use it. You propose flying to school everyday. Despite my shared excitment, I am trying to explain to you that it is actually more effective to use a car. An airplane is only effective over longer distances or to pass obsticals.
In the same way blockchains are only effective when the system is permissionless, which is not what banks want. Applying blockchains to permissioned situations is a classic example of over enginering and not effective.

Great post
I do not think the point about low bandwidth miners producing smaller blocks due to higher orphan risk costs is a good one.  The system is designed to ensure consensus about the one true chain i.e. prevent orphans.  We must not "use" orphan risk to drive block creation policies and therefore fees.  Otherwise orphan risks are pushed to the limit and orphan risk costs are then guaranteed to be a significant cost for miners.  This is a dangerous idea and causes centralisation, as miners dont propagate to themselves, therefore larger miners have a comparitive advantage.

How did you make that assumption with the 1 gbps line in 2032, things would be comfortable.  BIP101 could have 2GB blocks by then.  At 100% efficiency miners would therefore spend 16/600 = 2.7% of the time downloading the block.  How do you know 2.7% is not significant in relation to their profit margins?  It sounds like a lot to me.  Remember mining margins can change over time, in sone scenarios this 2.7% gap could be catastrophic for the network.
@_date: 2015-11-06 15:56:19
Lets assume that miners want to maximise short term cashflow.  Do you then agree they will keep including lower and lower fee transactions, to get as much income as possible ?
Now you probably disagree with the assumption, which is fine.  However my point is the industry goes through cycles, and during some periods this assumption could be mostly true.

What if its implemented in a highly risky way which is a major security threat?  For example no activation deadline and only requiring 75% miner support to activate.

Satoshi said "the incentive **can** transition entirely to transaction fees".  He didnt really explain how, that bit is left to us.  I think Jeffs BIP100 is a brilliant solution to this.  
If we increase the blocksize limit too much, we will be unable to have a working fee market, since supply will be almost unlimited.

Yes, I talked about how reliance on orphan risks like that will result in the failure of the system.  For example how technological advances may mean orphan costs fall over time, and therefore fees fall over time to low levels.
Even with a minimum fee level, a block limit lowering volume can still increase revenue.  This is because users may need to pay higher fees offsetting the volume decline.

It might **seem** just different and not stupid, but that is not the case.  Not activating SegWit using bit 1 causes a lot of problems and issues.  For example needing to build a new p2p transport network to send around the blocks with witness data, despite a new transport network already being in use.  On the other had there is **no disadvantage of adding bit 1** to the other bit 4 flag.  Therefore I would say that this is not "just different", but somewhat stupid.

This amazing thing has been achieved because people across the world all run consensus compatible code. If people all start running different code, that results in different chains being considerd valid, like you appear to advocate, then the whole project has failed.
This is why we need to achieve consensus first, before we start running code which splits the chain.  Appart from this, everyone agrees on open discussion and debate.
I appreciate the frustration you feel. Bitcoin is an ambitious project and it was never going to be easy.  I hope you understand these difficulties we are facing.
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:56:29
I agree.
But you see, if there is no economically relevant blocksize limit, then this will be a major issue regardless of technological improvements.
Let me try to explain:
1. Peter R's idea - Orphan risk costs drive fees, as there is no economically relevant blocksize limit
2. Therefore - Miners make blocks where marginal orphan risk cost = fee
3. Therefore - Fees fall to the level around marginal orphan risk cost
4. Therefore - Total orphan risk cost is significant in relation to total fee revenue
5. Therefore - Since miners do not need to propagate to themselves AND orphan risk cost is significant relative to the industry size,  larger miners have a significant comparative advantage over smaller miners.
6. Therefore - Larger miners have larger profit margins, all else being equal
7. Therefore - Mining centralization occurs

No we should not pick the size for 2036 now...

@_date: 2015-11-08 00:58:34
I am responding to you questions.  If you want a summary point, it is this:
Bitcoin needs a relevant blocksize limit to ensure a fee market works when the block reward falls. (i.e. not like the last six years) Therefore we should not tolerate BIP101, as 8GB could be too large.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:53:53


Please could you name one?


We can.  Segwit will double throughput.  The other great thing about SegWit is not only that its a softfork, but also upgraded and non upgraded wallets can seamlessly transact with each other, so we do not create two classes of Bitcoin.  This makes SegWit an incredibly fast blocksize limit increase, as one wallet upgrading gets an instant 80% capacity increase without even waiting for others to upgrade!!
After this activates we can move on to technologies like Schnorr signatures, MAST and perhaps a hardfork to increase the limit even more.  The onchain throughput can be huge.


Not at all.  There is a roadmap to go well beyond just 6 to 10
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:23:23
I see, so they will use both bits?  Will the softfork then require one or both bits after 80%?  Otherwise how do old SegWit nodes get activated?

It's from there BU video.  They say emergent consensus is like a flock of birds
@_date: 2015-11-29 09:26:54
Increasing the blocksize limit is a hard fork. If a new 1.1MB block is produced, then existing clients will regard that block as invalid.  Newer client's which accept larger blocks may regard it as valid.  We could now have two versions of the blockchain.  There are now different coins and the network is split, consensus has been lost.  This is a catastrophic failure and Bitcoin may be finished.
RBF is just a new type of transaction and behaviour nodes adopt.  It is not a rule that can change how nodes accept blocks or reject  blocks as invalid.  Therefore this change cannot result in different nodes accepting different versions of the blockchain as valid.
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:19:20
I agree we should consider the situation where individual miners have a negligible percentage of hashing power.  We should also note that this is also a desirable characteristic of the network and something we should  aim for anyway.
 &gt; This way you don't have to argue about whether or not miners have a long term strategy or a short term strategy, because their individual actions have no influence on the market, so only selfish immediate performance matters.
I do not think this is totally right.  It is true they may not have any influence on the market, however this does not mean only "selfish immediate performance matters".  There are a number of factors which determine this, including:
 * Attitude and philosophy of mining management teams
 * The remaining useful economic life of the mining hardware
 * If the mine is debt financed
 * Current profit margins
 * If mining management teams have ownership of the mining assets or are on a fixed contract
There is no clear way of determining how long the outlook of miners is, this is often a subjective matter.  My principal argument is that these factors may vary over time in cycles.  Therefore we need to construct a network resilient against both the long term and short term game theory logic.
@_date: 2016-10-12 16:28:49


I think this is a good point and I agree with a lot of what you say.  The line of thought here is that Bitcoin can be a really transformative technology that can change the world.
However, in the last 18 months or so I have slowly began to change my view.  The community is divided and many people do not appreciate the desirability of an apolitical currency, or at least have a different vision of what that means to you or I.  This is a significant part of the community and they have continued to try and conduct a contentious hardfork via political means.
Therefore I consider that in some respects, Bitcoin has already failed.  We need to be a bit more pragmatic and recognize that failure.  We also need to be less ambitious in how transformative this technology is.  It is probably less likely to change the world or become as valuable as we once thought.  This is a huge shame.  I admire the commitment of people still fighting for this vision, however it looks like the project is failing.
Once we recognize this failure, perhaps we can be pragmatic and do a hardfork, partially driven by a political campaign.

Please can you stop talking about the rate of technological improvements in storage and bandwidth.  I listed mentioning that smaller block advocates lack vision in this area as a common misconception, because I sometimes find these comments frustrating, divisive and patronising.  Small blockers do not, in general, lack vision in this area.
As I explained, these very improvements are actually a reason I have against larger blocks.  This is because Peter R's idea of financing mining with orphan risk costs cannot work, as these costs decline with technological improvements.
At the same time, we should be cautious and not extrapolate historic growth rates forward.
Please also respond to my other point that BIP100.5 is not consistent with the existing power structure so could be undermined.  This is with respect to an increase in the limit with just 35% of votes.  50% of the miners can impose a lower limit and prevent this, if they collaborate and orphan all blocks above a certain size.  This fact needs to be reflected in the voting mechanism, otherwise the voting system ignores reality.  Please note this is not true for a vote to decrease the limit, as non mining nodes will enforce this rule, so 50% of miners cant overule it.

The block rewatd is currently large so this discussion doesnt apply to the current system, obviously without this reward the system would have already failed.  This is why I can tolerate almost all the current blocksize increase proposals.  I oppose BIP101 because it keeps increasing the limit up to 8GB when the reward may fall as low as 0.39BTC.

Well is about priorities.  Security  &gt; &gt; cheap transactions.  That doesn't mean we can't have cheap transactions, I think we can.  For example BIP100 is a good balance that should ensure low fees.
@_date: 2015-11-07 00:16:07
I also like BIP100.  Not only is BIP100 a brilliant proposal, Jeff is also humble and modest and doesn't try to force it on people. Please see the following advantages of BIP100:
1. BIP100 is a pragmatic, balanced compromise proposal
2. BIP100 has the support from the majority of hashing power
3. BIP100 maximizes network security.
4. Miners vote to maximize their revenue. Revenue = block reward * FX rate + fees * volume * FX rate. This ensures miners vote to increase both fees and volume and the FX rate. This is an almost perfect compromise between competing priorities for the network.
5. Many say the limit is too small, BIP100 will result in larger blocks faster, since the block reward is currently high and fees are small, miners will vote to increase the FX rate and volume. i.e. larger blocks now
6. BIP100 is dynamic and avoids making predictions well into the future. Instead miners adapt their supply dynamically to meet demand. This occurs in most industries.
7. BIP100 ensures a fee market can work, as when the block reward is low, miners vote for an economically relevant blocksize limit, to avoid the tragedy of the commons problem where each miner keeps on lowering the fee until revenue nears zero.
8. BIP100 is pragmatic and has a 32MB limit.

 &gt; I mean BIP 100 is terrible and seems dangerous. Why do we waste so much time talking about it?
Great question.  BIP100 is primarily discussed due to its brilliance. Please see the following advantages:
1. BIP100 is a pragmatic, balanced compromise proposal, in contrast to the excessive BIP101, which is a white wash at one end of the spectrum
2. BIP100 has the support from the majority of hashing power
3. BIP100 maximizes network security.
4. Miners vote to maximize their revenue.  Revenue = block reward * FX rate + fees * volume * FX rate.  This ensures miners vote to increase both fees and volume and the FX rate.  This is an almost perfect compromise between competing priorities for the network.

I briefly talked through the issues at a presentation at a SF Bitcoin meetup.  I have chatted to Peter R about it on Reddit.  Peter R seems to somewhat agree, but says he doesnt care as he wants to assume a significant block reward.  I consider an insignificant block reward.  It is difficult for me to find the time, as I have a day job.
I hope to talk about this issue in Hong Kong.  Where Mike doesn't even want to listen, instead he wants to push ahead with BIP101 anyway. 
Do you understand my point as to why bandwidth costs do not matter?
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:38:37
 &gt;  Which chain is the one true chain? 
Well currently its pretty clear which chain, once that is not clear, then we have a problem.


I am sorry but I think this is wrong.  Firstly consider the "network effect" idea.  The idea that the value of the system is proportional to the number of connections between users.  Then consider the chaos and confusion involved, damaging the credibility of the system.
 &gt; It's just like for each Dollar in each pocket in the world the one Euro appears.
Think about how complex the split will be.  Initially there will be coins on both networks, then coins from the coinbase transaction in the first 1.1MB block will be invalid on the less than 1MB chain.  Then any other outputs merged with those coinbase outputs would also be invalid on the less than 1MB chain.  I have thought about this and there are at least 12 types of coins, all potentially trading against each other on the market.  This will be a total mess.  The 12 types are listed below, but there are probably even more difficult situations, not mentioned below:
* Coins valid on both chains
* Coinbase coins from the &gt;1MB chain
* Coinbase coins from the &lt;1MB chain
* Outputs merged with coinbase coins from the &gt; 1MB chain
* Outputs merged with coinbase coins from the &lt; 1MB chain
* Coins on the 1MB chain, spent to a different output on the &gt;1MB chain
* Coins on the &gt;1MB chain, spent to a different output on the 1MB chain
* Coins spent on the 1MB chain, output  unspent on the &gt;1MB chain
* Coins spent on the &gt;1MB chain, output  unspent on the 1MB chain
* Coins on the 1MB chain, spent to a different output on the &gt;1MB chain and merged with coinbase outputs on the &gt;1MB chain
* Coins on the &gt;1MB chain, spent to a different output on the 1MB chain and merged with coinbase outputs on the 1MB chain
* Coins valid in both chains, spendable with the same private key, but with a different history
Then of course there is the issue of hashing power moving back and forth between the chains and at the same time miners attacking rival chains.
The entire objective of the system is to converge on one chain.  If we fail to do this, then people will assume the failure can happen again, we have then failed.  Simple as that.

I agree with you that it would be good to support larger volume and I do not support keeping a 1MB limit.  I am very confident that almost everyone involved in Bitcoin wants higher volumes.
I think we need higher volumes and a working fee market.  A supply constraint is therefore required, which can be much larger than 1MB.  However I think commiting to an 8,000x increase now is excessive.  Therefore I oppose BIP101.
A more balanced, dynamic and demand driven system like BIP100 would be good.
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:19:06
It doesnt really increase their power that much at all.  They have no extra power to lower the limit, since 50% can already orphan a block that is too high.  BIP100 gives miners some extra flexibility to increase the cap, relative to the 1MB limit.  Miners should control this since they provide the service, they should control the quantity of goods they supply.

No they would not.  One can flag anything.  There has been enough false flagging in the last year


Adding a bit 1 flag, does not make it any easier for miners needing to say "fuck you", in the way you say, if you require both bits. That of course still doesn't force a hardfork, since miners cannot do that.  But it isnt any less forceful with the  bit 1 flag


Miners forcing the threshold to 95% despite some miners not wanting to support it is a separate issue to SegWit2x not having the bit1 flag at all.
I agree its unethical, only because BIP9 improves this and this is why I support BIP149.  But I do not remember anyone complaining when the previous softforks forced miners to flag

I agree with this, but BU supporters clearly do not.  For example in the BU FAQ it says:




Source:  
Note: * This will also require SPV clients to upgrade, although I thought preventing this was one of the main reasons for opposing SegWit
BU supporters seem happy for a period where the network is unusable and people need to wait for more confirmations and should expect re orgs of large depth.  Actually predictable 4 block re orgs are built into the BU implementation.
I agree this is a bad idea and network uptime is important.  However look at Ethereum, recently c80% of nodes were booted off the network and then 80% of nodes were effectively DoS attacked.  The network was essentially down for most node operators, however people seemed not to mind, because:
1. Ethereum is not used as an actual currency that much, so network upside is not vital
2. The community still have a shared vision and sense of community, even if the network is down
3. Running full nodes is not an important part of Ethereum culture
4. Many people like to use exchanges to speculate and network uptime is not required if you keep your money on deposit at exchanges

My point was simply that the 1MB limit is a consensus  rule.




It's not my rules, it's called Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is full of all kinds of arbitrary rules and constants.  For example reward schedule, 10 minutes, 100 block period, 2 week difficulty adjustment ect ect


Please fork away, set a flag day and be done with it.
Please stop insisting on taking a majority of miners and SPV wallets with you, while at the same time ensuring that if Core gets the lead over your chain for even one block, all your coins vanish.  What an unnecessary and odd proposition for you to give investors.

 &gt; I still consider Full RBF as vandalism far more dangerous than the hardfork.
There is nothing inherently wrong with hardforks, these may need to occur from time to time.  The dangerous part is a contentions hardfork splitting the chain.  
Do you think opt in RBF is more dangerous than a chain split?
To me the most dangerous thing that can happen, is a loss of consensus about which chain is the one true chain, I would categories that as a catastrophic failure of Bitcoin.  Every other risk is small compared to that.
In my view, potentially double spendable zero conf transactions, without relying on other trust or security measures, is a very small part of the system.  Therefore anything that either makes this significantly better or worse, it not likely to be important or dangerous.   Compareing the magnitude of the risk in this area to a catastrophic chain split is not sensible.
Lets think about zero conf in a bit more detail:
 * Online physical items or services  - not relevant as the furfillment time is longer than confirmation time
 * Online Digital goods - one should be able to reverse the product or service in the event of a double spend
 * Exchanges/gambling/other online/high value - Would always wait for confirmations 
 * Point of sale - use mechanisms such as security cameras, basic in person trust ect
 * Person to person - normal personal trust
Please tell me when this zero conf double spend problem actually arises?  The only things I can think of are layer two technologies like Counterparty, these layer 2 platforms can easily spot the RBF flag

Its difficult to tell when consensus has been reached. Therefore in general I think we should be more open and move to the position of not banning things.

@_date: 2015-11-08 17:00:51
 &gt; Only if the use case is microtransactions or something like that
Who knows what the use case could be?  If the fee is low enough then Bitcoin could be used for anything, a game, data storage, ect ect.  We simply do not know so we need to be open minded and flexible, rather than locking in high growth for 20 years.
 &gt; For most users, the difference between 98% certainty that it would confirm in 1 hour and 99.9% certainty that it would confirm in 1 hour is worth a lot more than $0.05.
I make the following assumptions:
1.    The underlying assumption is that users and wallets are operate a mature environment and engage in sophisticated strategies to ensure they pay the lowest possible fee.
2.    User wallets analyse the memory pool, have good knowledge about orphan costs and even construct live dummy blocks every few seconds in order to determine the lowest possible fee which ensures the transaction makes it into the next block. Wallets regularly automatically increase the fee as the memory pool grows, to ensure the transaction is likely to get into the block.

We can discuss a hardfork.  For example "BIP100 is a hardfork and I think it is a good idea because it results in a market driven balance between volume and fees".  We can discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different hardforking proposals.  Another example, "I think BIP101 is an excessive hardfork, because it raises the limit by 8,000x over 20 years and I think this is too far out in the future to plan for right now."  I am sure these comments will be allowed.
What you are not allowed to do is encourage adoption of a hardfork, before consensus.  For example, "I support BIP100, therefore I would like to encourage node operators and miners to activate this hardfork now, against the will of other users."  This type of comment may be banned.
I do not necessarily agree with the rules, but I understand the mods have to draw the line somehwere.
For example maybe posts offering miners bounties to switch to a hardfork that increases the block reward should be banned?  What do you think?

Cant we solve this problem by flagging the payment output as FSS and allowing the value of the change output to fall? This may be difficult to implement and damage privacy, but its kind of a full RBF and FSSRBF hybrid.

No, people are saying they want segwit, but they will only activate it to get people to agree to a hardfork, that is not acceptable.
Also the agreement is broken, since it wants to activate SegWit using the wrong bit, which makes no sense.

Why would it say miners will switch to the limit in 3,000 blocks?  Why would that be true?
Maybe we could let users type in the message themselves in another GUI box.  On a serious note, I think the consensus client should include consensus code. We shouldn't add features like this, as it is not part of the Bitcoin consensus process.  For example it has no convergent properties and could therefore confuse users.
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:23:51
If the price is higher...
You are illustrating exactly why we need a limit.  From the point of view of the next block, the miner will mine the full 10,000 transactions, then fees will be too low.  We need a limit to prevent this for the long term health of the system, which cannot be achieved without a limit, as the miner will want to maximize revenue in the next block.
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:18:03
If there is no fee market then there is no fee...
Miners are competing with each other in a competitive environment for fees.  Miners should keep adding more transactions to their blocks to get more fee revenue.  They will keep adding transactions to the point where fee = marginal cost of adding the transaction.  This marginal cost is very small, its almost only propagation costs, which may decline over time as technology improves.  Therefore the fee revenue will be low.
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:15:39
My answer is I do not know...
I have written before about how mining is more important in the consensus process than many people think, due to the fact it is more convergent.

I don't know.  Authors of the messaging system told me about them when I was asking for BIP149.

@_date: 2015-11-07 22:11:13
 &gt; I believe that constantly falling mining revenue (due to halvings) will cause centralization
I do not necessarily agree with this.  I do not see how a shirking industry size always results in a comparative advantage to larger players over smaller ones.  Although this is very possible.
 &gt; If miners could have an increasing revenue through transaction fees I think we would see more miners able to be profitable and less centralization. 
I agree with this.  However, **in order to have a working fee market, we need an economically relevant blocksize limit.**  Otherwise fees will go downwards towards marginal orphan risk costs.  The security of the system then fails.  We must stop BIP101 in order to save the system.
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:34:27
Yeah I saw that.  Luckily there is no rush.  We can revisit this issue in a few years time.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:18:07
Marginal cost is the cost of orphan risk.  Therefore orphan risk cost is large relative to fee revenue.  This is obviously very bad for the system.
List of reasons this is bad:
1. Low network security 
2. Mining centralization
3. Wasted work
4. Falling network security as technology improves
5. High orphan rate
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:15:52
 &gt; Can you put some estimated numbers behind your qualitative arguments? 
My analysis is based on basic economics.  Price = marginal cost in a competitive industry.  Therefore the price will fall to the level of marginal costs.  It is as simple as that.  However much bandwidth improves, the price will keep falling to the marginal costs.
 &gt; You are arguing for a future based on a theory when the past doesn't match that theory.
The past is not relevant for a number of reasons.  Most notably the existence of a large block reward.  The whole point I am trying to address is how to finance the mining industry from fees.  Therefore why do you bring the past up when the mining industry was not financed by fees?

@_date: 2016-10-26 11:31:30


Why not for long?  There are plans for massive capacity increases and as supply increases this will put downward pressure on prices.  Examples of large onchain capacity increases l include:
* SegWit +c85% more capacity (imminent)
* MAST
* Schnorr signatures 
* aggregated signatures 
* a hardfork to increase the limit on non witness data (once this dangerous confrontational stuff mostly stops, otherwise it may be to risky to do a hardfork)
* plus much more

The core devs have a wide spectrum of views on the subject
Please see this thread from 2011 on the subject:
Mike Hearn - April 22, 2011, 07:26:12 PM
 &gt; The death spiral failure mode seems plausible.  Putting a floor under fees by artificially limiting the scalability of the network leads to the obvious question of how to set those limits? Today they are chosen rather arbitrarily just as a hack around the lack of client mode. If they are the answer to how the entire system supports itself later there'd need to be some real logic behind it.  When inflation drops significantly, we'll end up with this nasty dynamic whereby the only way to get a more secure network is to lower the artificial limits and so force people to pay more, but that makes BitCoin less attractive as a competitor to existing systems. You can choose either adoption or security but not both. That seems like a recipe for failure.
The very next day Mike seems to have made his final decision: "I think there is a model that lets us solve this problem without any artificial scalability limits." 23 April 2011

I do not like the idea of being a able to propagate blocks quickly being a comparitive advantage.  Since miners do not need to propagate to themselves this helps larger miners and increases centralisation.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:56:30
I agree with almost everything you have said here, especially the cartel point.
The issue I have with BIP100.5 is that an increase can occur without a majority of miners agreeing.  I both think this is inappropriate and think this undermines the voting system.  50% of the hashrate can collaborate and prevent this increase anyway in most circumstances, simply by orphaning these larger blocks.  Therefore the voting system should reflect this reality.

This is because there is no real demand for transactions right now, Bitcoin is not that useful and a niche product where people play around becuase its very interesting.
**If** Bitcoin becomes successful and useful, demand will be huge and real.  People and businesses will therefore look to save on fees.
If Bitcoin is not successful, then this discussion doesn't matter anyway.  Therefore lets assume we do have this problem.  What kind of market are you relying on where people just pay because they cant be bothered to lower the fee?  Software will do this for them anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:25:17
The fees are high because the blocksize limit is quite small. The developers have released a proposal to increase the limit and lower fees (called SegWit).  Activating this is up to the community not developers.
So far the community has not activated the blocksize limit increase.  That is not the fault of developers 
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:31:42
For example I support BIP100.  However, I want to persuade the comminity of its technical merits before advocating its activation against the will of the community.  Doing so would be destructive for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-23 14:00:19
There is a track record of 95% working.   It worked 3x in 2015. There was even an incident of miners false flagging to get to 95%, this shows we need to be really cautious with this stuff.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:59:09


That is not true.  You seem to be confused.
1. Promotion or discussion of software forks (e.g. Bitcoin Knots) is allowed
2. Discussion of hardfork clients, is allowed
3. Promotion of hardfork clients is allowed, if there is consensus across to community for the hardfork 
4. Then there is a grey area.  Which is promotion and campaigning for hardfork clients without consensus.  My understanding this can be banned, but it's a difficult issue. If the activation methodology is particularly and  unecessarily  dangerous, for example Bitcoin Classic with the asymmetric disadvantage, short grace  period and rolling 75% voting threshold, locking in 25% miner opposition at the time of the hardfork, then promotion, but not discussion, of that client is banned.  I know some people do not like it, but this subreddit is called Bitcoin, I do not think it should allow itself to be used as a platform to attack Bitcoin
     
@_date: 2015-11-07 00:23:17
They maximize short term revenue by including every transaction, even ones with tiny fees.  Then all users keep lowering their fees and we get a downward fee spiral, revenue gets lower and lower.  This then gets to a point where orphan risk cost is large relative to fee revenue and the system eventually breaks down.  This is a catastrophic failure of the system and must be avoided by a blocksize limit. 
I try to explain it a bit in this video:
Please note, this does NOT mean I want either higher fees or 1MB blocks.  I think we can have both lower fees and larger blocks.  I just think we need to act in moderation in a pragmatic way, without locking in an 8,000x increase now.  This 8,000x increase must be avoided at all costs, other than that, I am pretty happy with almost all other blocksize proposals.

I will respond to your question.  But just to confirm this doesn't followvon from the above and is just a new point?  Right?
Read the Wikipedia article on monopolistic prices and it will answer your question.  It is possible for volume to fall and revenue to increase.  Its depends on the price elasticity of demand.

You are correct, in your reply to I dont agree.  I think we *could* need an artificial cap at a rate below demand to help the fee market function.  Especially since I think if Bitcoin is successful the level of potential demand could be absolutely massive or even considered infinite for all practical purposes.
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:30:19
Mike, I agree with almost everything you say on this topic.  However, isn't Peter right to raise the issue up and discuss potential countermeasures like RBF?  You are right this is not an issue now, however there is a risk that the dynamics in the mining industry could change and that this issue becomes a serious concern for the network.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:55:02
 If miners accsepted the 0.01 BTC transactions, then why would anyone waste money and pay 0.1 BTC again?  Future revenue may fall.  So it is possible for a smaller blocksize limit to increase revenue.  It depends on the price elasticity of demand.  That is why BIP100 is so clever, miners assess the price elasticity of demand and vote on a limit to maximise revenue.
@_date: 2015-11-22 19:50:46
I do not fully understand the proposal either, at this point it seems quite vague.  However Peter said:
 &gt; Basically, the idea is that nodes will always track the longest persistent chain, but they won't immediately accept a block greater than their block size limit until it is buried at a certain depth in the longest persistent chain.
I think this "buried at a certain depth" idea violates the core convergent property of Bitcoin, such that nodes would no longer converge on one chain. It appears to me that nodes switch their view on the one true chain depending on their particular blocksize limit preferences and therefore by design, different nodes have a different idea of the blockchain at the same time.  To me, this violates the core convergent/consensus principle of the system. Sticking with the longest valid chain rule is preferable, since it gives one version of the blockchain a clear lead, where possible. 
As I said in that thread:
 &gt; For example:
 &gt; There could even be say 3x 5MB blocks with a five block lead, and 2x 2MB blocks with a 2 block lead over a 1MB block chain. Each version could have conflicting transactions. Then a 3MB block built on top of the fork with 3x 5MB blocks and a 6MB block built on top of the fork with 2x 2MB blocks. What a divergent mess with no clear leader.
 &gt; You do realise the point if the system is to converge on one version of the chain as quickly as possible, dont you? This core innovative property was extremely difficult to achieve and cannot be messed with without a new and significant scientific breakthrough. Your proposal is a divergent system and not a consensus system at all.
@_date: 2015-03-20 23:57:04
What happens if a miner wants to change their mind about which chain to work on?  In Bitcoin miners can change their mind for perfectly legitimate reasons and this is a good thing because this is part of forming consensus, this can be crucial, especially in times of crisis.  Under your proposal it seems that if a miner changed their mind about which chain to work on they would be punished.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:24:15
That is not a change to how a user opts into a hardfork.  This is exactly what is happening right now.  You are just making it worse by having a sliding scale causing more destructive splits

This is a complex problem and we need time to come to a solution.  Your just focusing on the number of kids that can carry boxes, this is an oversimplification of the issue, what about all these other issues:
 * Do you realize if you increase the width of the box by n times, you could increase its mass by n^3 ?  This is a non linear problem, therefore we need to be very cautious with increases.  I know many people say this is not true and just because we increase the size of the box they may not be full and therefore the mass may not change as much.  This is not the correct philosophy, we need to assume the worst case attack scenarios of full boxes.
 * Currently these boxes are on sale at some small Mom-and-pop stores across the globe.  I admit there are not enough stores and this needs to increase.  If we increase the box size the boxes will no longer fit in the smaller stores and may not be available on display.  The boxes may only fit in large out of town stores like Walmart or be available online from Amazon, where your order can be tracked by the NSA.  Is that the future we want?  I thought this project was about helping the little guy and not large greedy corporations or the government.
 * What about the factories which make the boxes?  Why should they make boxes that are so big that they are not full.  I have a vision for the future where most boxes are full.  We should not increase the box size too much right now, to allow the possibility of full boxes one day.
 * Maybe kids could carry boxes which are a bit larger, but what about the box producers?  There are already only a few factories globally that can make the boxes,  but if the boxes are larger then an even smaller number of factories will be able to make boxes.  We need to ensure there are many potential box producers.
 * Why are we making the boxes 8,000x bigger by 2035?  How do you know what kids will be able to carry then?  What kind of business ever makes such detailed plans that far into the future?  Lets double the sizes of boxes now and worry about 2035 some other time.  Please stop advocating such an excessive increase in the box size.
 * There is too much focus on simple things such as what today's kid can carry.  We also need to consider how fast they can carry the boxes around.  How are the children going to have fun if they spend all their time carrying boxes and do not have enough time to actually use and enjoy them?
 * Also what about increasing the risk of dropping the box.  If the box becomes too large, fine the kids can probably carry it most of the time, but there is a larger risk that it is dropped and then damaged.  This is bad and the risk of dropping the box should be minimized.  We need actual data on the risk of a kid dropping a box and how it changes with respect to box size.

90 days after release or activation?
Also I have been thinking recently it may not be a good idea to increase the  blocksize space limit for non SegWit transactions that much.  SegWit offers great benefits like reduction of malleability and linear scaling of sighash operations.  It is not clear to me why we would want to dramatically increase the block space available for malleable transactions with quadratic scaling of sighash operations.  In the future me may need much higher capacity and much larger blocks, if we allow quadratic scaling of sighash operations in this extra space we could open up new attack vectors.

The key concept here is "Price elasticity of demand"

The image assumes that as the supply increases, there is no impact on price.  This is an extreme scenario called "Perfectly elastic demand".  This normally occurs when prices are extremely low, almost zero.  In normal circumstances prices fall as supply increases.

I dobt agree we should assume such technological improvement, and if I did, I would still oppose BIP101.
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:49:57
The opposition to SegWit does not seem to be based on the blocksize limit increase,  despite it being controversial.  
Some people oppose SegWit because they want to persue an irrational  vendetta against Bitcoin Core developers who wrote SegWit, because many incorectly associate these developers with an unpopular moderation policy on this subreddit.  SegWit opposition is kind of a vindictive or stubborn way of trying to win an argument, rather than being based on technical grounds  related to the risks of the larger blocks.
While I don't agree with opposing SegWit on these grounds, unfortunately we can all be stubborn or vindictive at times.
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:37:40


Yes sure.  Not BU for example, but Bitcoin Classic (or even up to 4MB of non witness data) like that, with a 6 month grace period, certainly, I would happily support it.
@_date: 2016-10-27 01:16:39


We are not doing nothing, there are many many improvements being done to mitigate and solve these apparent capacity problems:
* Replace by fee, allowing users to bump up the fee
* Wallets improving fee estimation technology, massive progress has been made in this area, with dynamic fees very widely adopted
* CPFP, allowing the receiver of a transaction to bump up the fee
* SegWit, with a c85% capacity increase and improved scalability, so that further capacity increases can occur down the line
* Businesses becoming more efficient with blockspace, for example Coinbase no longer sending two transactions everytime a user sends a transaction
ect ect
Ironically there seems to be a negative correlation between the people solving these issues and the blame they get.  If you have a solution, please implement it.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:05:00
Agreed.  But I think its important we are careful and do not make the mistake of the XT/BU/Classic movements, we do not want to go nuts and start to enforce stupid rules before proper calm technical analysis.  Lets make the UASF as safe as possible.
But do not forget, devs are also part of the community.  They can speak out too.
@_date: 2017-05-02 01:08:47


The Core development team have made massive progress on scalability, in the last 20 months alone.  For example:
* Segwit, which includes linear scaling of sighash operations, third party transaction malleability fixes, reducing the amount of data required by the signature generator and, above all, a large **c110% onchain capacity increase via a blockszie increase** (wallets can get the benefit of an 80% capacity increase almost **instantly**, as soon as activation occurs without even waiting for others to upgrade, unlike a hardfork which may require a 12 month grace period).  Perhaps the most impressive thing about SegWit is the speed of the blocksize increase, it can occur incredibly fast.
* Libsecp256k1, which improved signature validation speeds by c7x
* Pruned mode 
* Mempool limiting option mode for nodes
* Blocks only mode for nodes
* Reducing upload traffic
* Compact blocks
* Opt in RBF - helping the sender increase the priority of transactions 
* CPFP - helping the receiver increase the priority of transactions 
* Continued work on the development of LN and payment channel technology
* Headers first
* Plus much much more
The only issue we have now is a small wealthy minority (who are clearly hostile to Bitcoin) are spreading lies about the blocksize limit increase* (AKA SegWit) and preventing it from activation.  As members of the community, its up to all of us to rise up against these hostile actors and get the blocksize limit increase we need.  In my view, we need to act now, or we could be stuck with the small 1MB limit for years.
Note:  *Please note, when its mentioned that SegWit is a blocksize increase, this is true for every conceivable meaning of the words "blocksize increase".  SegWit is both an effective increase in transaction capacity and a literal increase in the amount of data per block.  (Of course old nodes still only see 1MB of data, but its totally impossible to do anything about that)
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:37:28
Yes we are allowed to talk about full blocks and ideas about how to address the issue.  What is not allowed is encouraging a hardfork before consensus.
For example, I support BIP100, I would like to persuade others of the benefits of BIP100.  Then if consensus is reached, we can enourage a hardfork on this sub reddit.
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:56:11

Good, we just need to ensure that propagation costs remain reasonably small relative to the revenue of the mining industry.  This is why I oppose BIP101, because will create a fee market where propagation costs drive fees.  Then fees fall to levels around propagation costs, and the mining industry fails.
@_date: 2015-10-22 01:01:45
Sorry I am not necessarily talking about orphan rates.  I an talking about the orphan risk cost to miners (a related concept).
If there is no blocksize limit, then users will lower the fee level to the  extra orphan risk cost to the miner, of including that transaction.  This necessarily guarantees that the cost of orphan risk is very high in relation to industry revenue.  Bandwidth cost improvements will not change this.
If O(1) is fully achieved then fees will be zero and mining industry revenue will fall to zero.  Either way we need an economically relevant blocksize limit.

Miners want to remain profitable, but in a competitive environment they have no choice.  Miners are competing against each other for fees.  In some circumstances the nash equilibrium is to keep including lower fee transactions to get as much revenue as possible, even if it lowers future fees, because the individual miner benefits themselves at the expense of the industry.  Its just like the classic tragedy of the commons problem.
None of this ignores anything on page 1 of the whitepaper.  The whitepaper mentions high costs and issues with other payment systems, such as trusting intermediaries.  With a working fee market the fees could still be lower compared to the costs mentioned in these other systems.  My comments say very little about the value of the fees, they could even be lower than today.

If he wants to be responsible about it, his hardfork should change formats so light wallets need to upgrade to follow him (even if he has more than 50% of the hashrate).

What difference do the new numbers make?
 &gt; a fee market cannot increase revenue 
Do you mean "lowering the block limit cannot increase mining  revenue"?  If so, yes most small block people probably disagree with this, as its established economic theory and mathematical fact that it's untrue.  I repeat again, it depends on the price elasticity of demand. 
If demand is price inelastic then the statement is false.  A smaller limit increases revenue 
If there is unitary elasticity, then changing the limit has no impact on revenue. 
If demand is price elastic, lowering the limit reduces revenue.
This is basic math...

I agree that may be too long


If BIP148 has strong support, I would support it.
However, this is a delicate issue.  If we manage to successfully pull off a UASF at short notice, which requires miners to upgrade. Perhaps miners will feel angry and they could do an unpopular MASF at short notice, like extension blocks, in response.  Then maybe users will be annoyed and do a PoW change or "anti extension blocks" UASF.  We should try to avoid this kind of fighting if possible.
I think we should try to respect miners as much as possible.  I think we should try to activate SegWit and still accept blocks from non upgraded miners as valid, just like the original SegWit plan.  This is very friendly to lazy miners or miners who do not like SegWit and keeps the ecosystem together on one chain.  Afterall, by accepting blocks from non upgraded miners after SegWit activates, we take advantage of SegWit's friendly opt in nature.

 &gt; The fact that orphan blocks exist doesn't decrease revenue from the mining industry.
Without an economically relevant blocksize limit, fees would fall to almost zero, since price = marginal cost and there is no marginal cost of adding a transaction.  Then people say that orphan risk cost is a cost.  This means that instead of fees falling to zero, they fall to orphan risk costs.  This may be true, but it still represents a catastrophic failure for bitcoin.
Let me try to explain:
1. Peter R's idea - Orphan risk costs drive fees, as there is no economically relevant blocksize limit
2. Therefore - Miners make blocks where marginal orphan risk cost = fee
3. Therefore - Fees fall to the level around marginal orphan risk cost
4. Therefore - Total orphan risk cost is significant in relation to total fee revenue
5. Therefore - Since miners do not need to propagate to themselves AND orphan risk cost is significant relative to the industry size,  larger miners have a significant comparative advantage over smaller miners.
6. Therefore - Larger miners have larger profit margins, all else being equal
7. Therefore - Mining centralization occurs
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:17:42
Where does it say that?
@_date: 2016-10-21 13:13:20


In my view we must not allow this propagation cost to be too large relative to fee revenue.  Otherwise centralisation pressure could be too high.  A fee market where spenders lower the fee to expected marginal orphan risk cost, guarantees orphan risk cost is very large relative to fee revenue, which is industry revenue.  This must be avoided, in my view.


Yes there may be a lot of miners with that long term outlook.  On the other hand there may not be.  
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:42:07
If people change the setting how will miners know?  Miners have to keep risking splitting the network to find out.
If this is in the GUI, there needs to be big warning messages.
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:21:37
 &gt; BIP 101 doesn't abolish the block size
No, my point is the limit needs to be economically relevant.  I think there is a risk 8GB could be too large
  &gt; you want to say the effect you're hypothesizing is (5) "significant", it's not enough to do it from first principles
I am not hypothesizing, I have put a lot of work into this.  It depends on how marginal cost of orphan risk varies as the block gets larger.  With almost any curve, orphan risk cost comes out as at least 25% of industry fee revenue.  When the orphan risk increases proportionally with the blocksize, then the orphan risk cost comes out as at least 98% of industry fee revenue.
 &gt; bandwidth is B
Bandwidth is not relevant in this calculation.  For example say bandwidth speeds double, orphan risk falls, then users bid lower fees.  Orphan risk cost as a proportion of fee revenue remains unchanged.  Understanding why bandwidth is irrelevant is key to understanding the severity of the problem.
@_date: 2015-11-09 03:03:59
Broadly speaking I agree with all your comments here.  I think the 50th percentile is the best, most fair, most simple idea that avoids this potential battle.  Thanks for listening to and understanding  my points, most people on Reddit completely ignore my technical points. 
By the way, the same criticism can be made about BIP100 with respect to a vote for a reduction in the limit.  BIP100 requires 80% approval for a reduction, when 50% could impose it anyway.  This could result in a dispute between for example 79% and 21%, such that the 79% force a reduction anyway.  In conclusion 50% votes or less should be required for a reduction and 50% votes or more should be required for an increase.  Therefore to avoid the perception of small block bias, I think a simple 50th percentile rule is best.
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:12:29
 &gt; you have to pay at least $0.01/kB in fees for that transaction. 
How does the system know the bitcoin price, in order to set this?
Also a fee floor is even more of an intervention than a supply cap.
 &gt; That way, miners can negotiate with themselves about what an acceptable minimum fee should be. It's collective bargaining, or a miner union, if you will. 
The nash equilibrium is to defect from an unenforceable agreement.  Read about price cartels.  They only work with one major producer who is the enforcer.  We need mining to be distributed and competitive.  That is why BIP100 is needed as a cartel enforcement framework.

That is interesting but outside the scope of the field of distributed consensus systems, since nodes no longer converge on one chain.
Miners could also set their preferred block reward in the header, and then choose what block reward to give themselves.  Full node users could then set the maximum block reward they would be willing to accept.  All this would do is split the chain.

 &gt; There are probably not "the smallblockers" as a homogenous mass. Everybody is an individual.
Yes, I am just saying these are often misconceptions.  They are not misconceptions in all cases.
 &gt; What are you talking about? BIP101 proposes 8x, not 8000x !
If BIP101 only had 8x increases, I would not feel the need to oppose it.
 &gt; BIP101 proposes 8000x by 2036 only
Yes, if 2036 is so far away such that it doesn't matter, then lets remove this part from BIP101
 &gt; note I support BIP100.5 because I am thinking looking that far into the future is not possible - a predefined schedule like BIP101 or BIP103 might be too conservative or too optimistic
I think this is a sensible comment,  I support BIP100.  In BIP100.5, why do we need a default growth rate?  Where does this desperation for growth come from?  Lets be patient and let miners decide how much space they want to supply.
 &gt; Yes, but apparently only very slowly. Probably too slow in case of BIP103. Same for BIP100, where a 20% minority can block anything.
BIP100 can allow for faster growth than BIP101, I will negotiate on this 20% point, if people have such strong views about it.  BIP103 allows for exponential growth for a long period of time.  I do not consider either of these as very slowly.
 &gt; How could fees fall if adoption grows faster than block size?
Firstly adoption may not grow faster than the blocksize.  Even if this does occur, then yes fees could still fall.  It depends on the nature, depth and elasticity of demand.
 &gt; Why does it not merit a response? Because conflict of interest is something that is against human nature in the first place?
This is clearly untrue.  People claim Blockstreams business model needs small blocks and lightning needs smaller blocks.  Blockstream only recently pivoted to lightning and lightning needs larger blocks.  At the same time Blockstream staff have had this same view for years.
@_date: 2015-10-21 22:14:39
Yes that is the quote I was refering to.
I see no reason why we need to maintain mining revenue during halvings.  I have no problem with a 50% fall in mining revenue in 2016.  I have heard people say the Bitcoin price needs to double in 2016 to balance out the halving, I do not get that.
I dont understand your question about 2MB  transactions and 1MB blocks, sorry.  It depends on the depth of demand.  There could be 1TB of demand with very low fees or 1.01MB of demand with high fees.

A miner could do that anyway.  A miner can flag bit 4 or not, regardless of not signaling bit 1.


That could happen anyway. It makes no difference.  The softfork rule could even require bit 1 AND bit 4.  So it doesnt make any difference.
Also miner signalling for a HF doesnt make much difference anyway.  Miners can only enforce Softforks, not hardforks

These have already been rolled out on the mainet. After years of testing to make sure everything goes smoothly.

The Core team work hard to make the blocksize limit increase as smooth as possible, with loads of tests, deployment of the new messaging systems in advance, ensuring upgraded wallets can seamlessly transact with old wallets, ensuring no chain split ect ect.  What is it that makes people obsessed with making the blocksize limit increase as dangerous and reckless as possible?

Nope, I do not think that is a claim and I do not recall ever seeing somone make this claim.  Often larger block now supporters try to characterise the other side of having more extreme posotions than they do, which polorizes the community.  I support a moderate blocksize increases when appropriate, as does almost everyone, including fee market advocates.  However, I oppose plans to lock in large exponetial increases for 20 years.
I do think its important Bitcoin always has an economically relevent blocksize limit, which is one of the reasons we should be cautious when increasing the limit.  Personaly I support BIP100, with technical upper bounds.
In general more hash power is better.  I am not concerned by short term reductions in hash power.

I have thought a lot about this question.  I reluctantly put disagree.
This paper influenced my decision here:
In my view in order for economics and markets to work, prices may need to be significant for consumers.  If you pay $0.0004 to view a news article on the New York Times website, the amount may be too low relative to your net worth, or too small for consumers to visualize.  At this level I do not see how markets can work.
Therefore I think, unfortunately, ordinary Bitcoin users will eventually need to worry about fees, in order for markets to function

The key concept here is "Price elasticity of demand"

The image above assumes an extreme case of "Perfectly elastic demand".  This never actually occurs in reality, but is normally associated with very low prices, of almost zero.  In general, prices tend to fall as supply increases.


An increase in supply results in a increase in total revenue, if and only if price elasticity of demand is greater than -1, i.e. price elastic.  This is by no means a fundamental truth.

Lets take a step back.  Bitcoin is an amazing achievement of economics, computer science, mathematics and engineering. Its amazing because users across the world, who dont trust each other, have consensus about the content of one true database, the blockchain, without a central point of failure. This amazing thing has been achieved because these people across the world all run consensus compatible code. If people all start running different code, that results in different chains being considerd valid, like you appear to advocate, then the whole project has failed.
This is why we need to achieve consensus first, before we start running code which splits the chain. 
I appreciate the frustration you feel. Bitcoin is an ambitious project and it was never going to be easy. I hope you understand these difficulties we are facing.

I agree that now is the time for users to get active.  We should get active and release a client/rally behind a plan now.  But we can still have a long grace period until the UASF activates.

What if transaction don't conflict but block headers are different?


Yes that always happens anyway.  The court is the ultimate master of the database.  Or I guess maybe the military is the absolute ultimate master.  However obviously that is not efficient.  Therefore you have a master adminstator of the database and only if you disagree with the decision of that administrator do you need to go to court.  That is how database systems work.


 miners do that in Bitcoin.  


Doesn't mention it


It seems you don't understand or can't express the problem you are trying to solve.  I can express the ordering problem Bitcoin solves, it is the ability to order entries in a database without an administrator or a court.  If you go back to having an administrator or court in charge, that is great, it works very well and is what databases have done incredibly well for decades.


That is what a backup is...

*“Whilst rational economic actors do attempt to maximise their profit, the argument ignores that this takes place in the context of varying time windows. In effect it argues that it’s “rational” to take a tiny increase in profit today even if that destroys your business and all the potential long term profits you could obtain tomorrow and the day after. This definition is absurd and no actual business works that way.” – Mike Hearn*
It seems to me part of the disagreement between Mike and Peter is a different understanding of mining incentives resulting in a different analysis of the game theory involved.  Let’s consider two types of miners:
**1.	Low cost miner** – This miner is at the bottom of the mining cost curve, (i.e. they have one of the lowest costs of hashing in the industry) perhaps they have cheaper electricity.  This miner is likely to have a long term perspective and behave more consistently with the way that Mike expects.  The miner is likely to be around for years and cares about the long term health and sustainability of the network.  Even if bitcoin prices fall, other higher costs miners will exit the industry first and the fall in the network hash rate may mean this miner sees only a minimal (if any) impact on profitability.
**2.	High cost miner** – This miner is at the top of the mining cost curve, perhaps they have the most expensive electricity costs in the mining industry.  This miner may have a more short term perspective and behave in a way more like Peter expects.  The miner could be struggling, making losses, running out of cash and desperately trying to remain operational, in desperate hope of either an increase in bitcoin prices or fall in the network hash rate.  This miner may not care about the long term sustainability of bitcoin operate in a RBF type manner.
In summary both Mike and Peter have valid points and are partially correct.  Hopefully there will always be many miners on different parts of the cost curve, with different behavioral incentives, resulting in a more robust network.  If one were to draw a mining cost curve, the shape could be very interesting.  The level of convexity or trend in bitcoin prices could determine the proportion of the hash rate producing bitcoins close to the marginal cost and therefore a risk of RBF type activity could increase.
Whilst I agree with almost all of what Mike says, he appears to be only considering this from a micro perspective.  There are macro situations which can impact on the behavior of miners across the industry.
**Healthy mining industry** -  
The image above is a typical mining costs curve, from the resources industry.  I think this is a healthy state which results from stable commodity prices.  However if bitcoin is in a long term bear market, such the the price moves towards the saddle point in the curve, large parts of the industry could come under stress and the RBF scenario could apply.
**Miners under stress** - 
This image illustrates the current cost of mining gold, after the price of gold has fallen, some of the largest miners in the industry are now producing with costs at or near the gold price.  These miners are focusing on short term profit maximization and could be forced to implement RBF type measures by their owners.  I think this could be a a genuine long term risk to the bitcoin network.  Although I acknowledge bitcoin mining has some very different characteristics from mining for traditional resources, most notably that as the higher cost bitcoin miners exit the market, the cost falls for everyone else.

I think significant means that it is enough to cause mining centralisation, since miners do not need to propagate to themselves.  Therefore larger miners comparatively benefit more, from higher orphan risk relative to industry size.
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:34:20
I keep saing we cant rely on orphan risk in this way.
 &gt; The risk of orphan does not decrease revenue for the mining industry because when a block gets orphaned another block is accepted.
You keep making this totally irrelevant point about the mining industry not losing revenue due to an orphan.  Why do you keep saying this?  It has nothing to do with this topic, although ironically this is a large problem anyway and orphans reduce network security.
Without orphan risk costs fees fall to zero.  With orphan risk costs fees fall to orphan risk costs.  I do not know why you are talking about orphan risks reducing revenue, either at the industry level or individual miner level.
The correct words you are looking for is revenue will increase or decrease with smaller or larger blocks, depending on the price elasticity of demand, not if "demand for larger block space exists."  **Smaller blocks will *increase* miner revenue, if and only if demand is inelastic.**  That is a mathematical fact.

I am not necessarily thinking of miners illegally collaborating with fraudsters, merely miners prioritizing conflicting zero conformation transactions with the one with the highest fee.  That would not be a criminal offense or illegal.
I think you are right in that some people are thinking of this in a more abstract manner (myself included), rather than considering real business happening now.  However we must realize Bitcoin is very small and we do not know how this system could develop and there could be other bitcoin use cases for which users changing the fees to try and double spend would not be criminal or theft.  However I appreciate you are probably right on this.

 * Include the ability to view details, like inputs, outputs and txids.

The basic point is simple and well understood.  We need an economically relevant blocksize limit.  Otherwise, fees will fall down to marginal orphan risk costs.  This is clearly a major problem for many reasons, analyzing how major of a problem this is, is not actually that important. 
List of reasons:
1. Low network security 
2. Mining centralization
3. Wasted work
4. Falling network security as technology improves
5. High orphan rate
Is it not apparent to you that we must avoid a situation where orphan risk costs are high relative to fee revenue?  Why does this need a paper?  The idea of relying on orphan risk costs to drive fees is not at all sensible.
@_date: 2015-10-03 10:59:05
Ok good point.  I mean the **long term** economic value of network security is currently around 25BTC per 10 minutes.  This therefore includes both capital and operating costs.  If one was to invest this amouny over the long term, you could control 50% of the hashrate and therefore control the network.  My initial point assumes a perfectly competitive mining leasing market, which is not necessarly realistic.
Sorry I am on my mobile and do not have data now.  However from a cpu perspective, verification time increases non linearly with the blocksize.  A normal 1MB block can take a fast i7 desktop PC up to 10 seconds to verify.  8GB could take over an hour.
Also are you aware of an attack block?  A block constructed to maximise verification time.  A 1MB attack block  could already take more than an hour to verify.  We need to sort this issue out before even thinking about increasing the blocksize limit.

There you go, that is how the headers can be different.  They could be missing a transaction




This does not make it immutable, the hash of the blocks can just change....


Just build a new chain of new different blocks. That makes nothing immutable


Yes what if the bank doesn't have the key, because the end user has the key?  


Then what makes each bank have the same database??  You have not provided any detail or idea about how this works.  You just magically it assume it works by somehow using the magic of bundling entries into blocks.


Yes it is nothing like Bitcoin.  What do you mean verifies existing blocks?  You mean it checks for valid signatures?  It has nothing to do with Bitcoin because there is nothing to ensure that the nodes each have the same dataset, without an administrator or master copy of the data.  There is nothing wrong with that, it just means it has nothing to do with Bitcoins or blockchains.  You do not solve a transaction ordering problem.

Mining is a competitive business.  In a competitive industry, price = marginal cost.  If orphan risks are the only significant marginal cost, marginal orphan risk of including on extra transaction = price.  Miners will then compete over the orphan risk, every tiny reduction in orphan risk improves margins and increases profits.  
At the same time miners will push and stress orphan risk right up to the same economic level as their revenue.  For example if the orphan risk is low, miners will increase the marginal orphan risk by including more transactions in their blocks, to ensure the marginal orphan risk is equal to their marginal revenue.  
This is a bad scenario for Bitcoin.  We need to minimize orphan risk, not make it the core factor that miners compete over and drives success or failure in the system.  
**At least with an economically relevant blocksize limit, we can hope that propagation costs become insignificant due to technological improvements.  Using propagation risk like this guarantees that we have relevant propagation costs and therefore mining centralization.**

BIP100.5 means 65% of the hashrate is required to prevent growth and therefore a minority (35%) of miners can increase the limit.   I think this is too risky, please can we make it fair such that at least 50% of the miners are required to increase the limit?
Allowing less than 50% of the miners to make a change and circumvent the majority of miners is not smart anyway, since 50% can always take control and veto sny change.  BIP100s voting is a subset of the existing power structure and can therefore be implemented.  BIP100.5 could break down if the will of the majority of miners is ignored.
What if we reduced the 80% majority required for a change  in BIP100 to 65%, would that be ok for you?
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:34:04
You are thinking about it from the point of view of the next block only.  You need to look at the issue from two angles.  The next block way you look at it from and the long term impact on fees.  If miners always include more transactions, fees will fall to very low levels.  As you say miners do always include more transactions, to get more revenue, X + Y.  However, this means users keep lowering the fee, since however low it is, its always included. Then fees become too low.  This is why we need a blocksize limit.

Firstly, I would not necessarily agree that this makes Bitcoin better than fiat money, I think this makes Bitcoin different or unique.  Whether this is better than fiat is more of an ideological or economic theory type of question, but being unique may be sufficient to ensure Bitcoin can have significant value.
I do not agree that its Bitcoin’s resilience to control by any person or privileged group is sufficient to be different enough from fiat.  In my view Bitcoin is resilient enough such that it cannot be controlled by anyone, even a majority of users and miners combined.  
In the last decade or so, central banks have undergone a campaign of aggressive quantitative easing, which is the purchasing of government debt by the central bank by simultaneously creating new bank reserves to finance these acquisitions.  Many people were unhappy at this policy, claiming the policy was conducted by people with a conflict of interest, that it reallocated resources unfairly to bankers or the asset owning classes, created too much inflation (prevented deflation), or prevented the economy from naturally correcting.  However, whatever you think of this policy, it was enacted by people that were appointed by those who won democratic elections.  If the majority people were sufficiently unhappy with this policy, it was within their power to elect representatives who could have stopped the process.  Perhaps one could argue there was a coordinated propaganda campaign to distract the public from the policy of central banks, but the fact is the number of people unhappy with the aggressive quantitative easing are in the minority and the majority do have the power to prevent it.  In my view, fiat paper, at least in democracies, is a majority rules system.
For Bitcoin to be unique or interesting, it must be resilient against not just a small privileged group taking control, but even a majority being able to change the rules and create new inflation.  Luckily I think this is the case, even if Bitcoin grows and a large wave of users enter the system and there is a successful coordinated propaganda campaign which convinces the majority of users and miners to create new inflation, the system may still be resilient enough to prevent this rule change.
A hardfork requires more than just majority consent, it requires no significant opposition to succeed.  This is because any significant opposition is able to cause disruption and uncertainty around the period of a hardfork, which will be unwelcome and troubling to businesses and users in the ecosystem, who value uptime and reliability.  Businesses and users are therefore incentivized to oppose contentious hardforks.
For example, many businesses have futures contracts where Bitcoin is the collateral, and these contract often trade 24x7.  These businesses are growing in size.  Any uncertainty during a contentious hardfork is likely to cause huge administrative, operational and legal problems for those involved in these futures contracts.  As the ecosystem grows, more users and businesses will depend or Bitcoin’s reliability and therefore a contentious hardfork will be harder to execute as time progresses.  Until eventually a tiny minority in the community has veto power over a hardfork.  This process ensures Bitcoin is unique when compared to fiat money, and a unique form of money is likely to have significant value, whether its better than fiat's majority rules system or not.

No.  If you wait until November, you do not need new code for the SegWit P2P layer, which is the complex and difficult bit.
New code to activate a blocksize increase in parallel with SegWit, may be required, but that is much easier than the P2P layer stuff.
If bit 1 was used, either at a 95% threshold or an old style softfork with compulsory signalling after activation, then we can use the existing p2p layer code, even before November.  That has nothing to do with whether a hardfork activates in parallel or not

I think its more about "making a point" that relying on zero conformations is less appropriate than some people think.  However I think there is a potential problem here and therefore this is worth discussing.
Consider the following process:
1. Bitcoin grows and becomes successful, the price of bitcoin increases considerably
2. Large mining companies enter the industry to profit from the booming bitcoin mania and speculative price increase
3. The bull market ends and bitcoin prices fall towards the marginal cost level of these large miners
4. These debt ridden miners struggle to make profits and the lenders take control with the hope of stripping as much cash as possible in the short term
5. These miners adopt RBF type behavior, undermining the security of the network and bitcoin experiences a downward spiral of further price reductions and more miner bankruptcies
Analyzing and addressing the impacts of RBF type behavior now, could help mitigate the impact of this potential crisis.

The entities financing these things are clearly hostile to Bitcoin, since they continue to support BU, despite BU being proven to be totally broken.  In addition to this they even admit that they oppose various Bitcoin protocol upgrades due to moderation policies on third party websites.  This is clearly hostile to Bitcoin, since protocol upgrades should be decided on by what is best for Bitcoin, if you bring your personal vendetta about a private website into it, you are clearly hostile to Bitcoin itself.

What I am trying to explain is that the miners total cost should be at most equal to total mining revenue.  Therefore an attacker could then spend this same money again and attack the network with 50% of the power.  I am ignoring the destinction between capital and operating costs as I do not see how that makes that much of a difference to this.  There are certain assumptions I make in my claim which might not be realistic.  For example what if the chip manufacturers are operating at full capacity and it would cost more money to convert more plants or what if the lowest cost power is already allocated to Bitcoin mining, so that the next unit of power costs more.  However in theory **any rational miner should be willing to sell out for their total revenue, therefore I think the claim that mining revenue is equal the value of network security is reasonable.** In theory one could lease the entire mining power for the mining revenue in any period.  Do you see why mining revenue is potentially such an important security metric?  Much more revealing than hashing power.
It is better to have consensus on the definition of an attack block to reduce orphan risks.
In Bitcoin's past there has been growth in both transaction volume and transaction size.  I see no reason why this would change going forwards.  Especially with multisig and lightning potentially becoming more popular.
I do not agree with your fee assumptions, with 8GB blocks fees are likely to be much lower per transaction.  Just because blocks are bigger does not mean the economic value of the network is increasing.  We could for example have full 8GB blocks because two people are playing a very niche game with each other that generates a lot of transactions, the economic value of the network could even be lower than today yet all 8GB blocks could be full.  To prudently evaluate the economic success of the network we should look at the USD value of mining revenue.  This is far more prudent and revealing than looking at transaction volume, which could have tiny economic significance.  Like you (I assume), I hope that one day Bitcoin transactions are on average as valuable and important as the VISA network transactions or banking system transactions and volumes are also as large, but we do not know if this will be the case.  We could have higher volume and lower value per transaction, this is very possible and typically internet systems work like this.
Also if optimisations like verifying transactions before the block arrives are so trivial, they should be implemented before a block size limit increase.  Is this not prudent?
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:42:39


That is not how BIP91 works. BIP91 requires 80% signalling bit 4 to activate.  Sure miners could only signal bit 1, but then it would not activate.
Of course this does not lock in a hardfork, since miners cannot do that whatever they signal.


I will not follow the HF if activation is tied to SegWit, on principal, ironically pairing the HF with SegWit ensures it fails, rather than succeeds.  But if they want to lock in failure then fine.  However adding support for bit 1, doesnt reduce how its tied to bit 1


Yes you are.
BIP91 requires 80% at bit 4 to activate.  (But to repeat again bit 4 doesn't guarantee a hardfork anyway)
Another thing a softfork could do, is require both bit 1 and bit 4

Your suggestion means Bitcoin is no longer a consensus system as each node will have a different valid chain.

How is an 8,000x increase careful and responsible?  BIP101 is excessive and risky and makes predictions well into the future when the block reward falls to 0.39BTC.  There are other more moderate balanced proposals out there like BIP100, BIP102 and BIP103. 
Even if you think BIP101 might be a good idea, please listen to the concerns of others and be willing to be pragmatic and compromise.  Please support a more balanced proposal, rather than one which will drive the community apart.

My point is that this violates the security assumptions which ensures we converge onto one chain.  Bitcoin' security model is built on the fact that miners mine for profit.  Mining costs and revenue need to drive the decision making process of miners, otherwise Bitcoin's security fails.

Please carefully think through the dynamics of a competitive fee market.  If orphan risks are the only significant marginal cost of including a transaction in a block, then users will lower fees to the level of orphan risk cost.  It is a basic principal of competitive markets, price = marginal cost.  This then lowers mining industry revenue to the point where orphan risk costs are high relative to fee revenue. (Please do not misinterpret this has me saying the absolute orphan risk will be high, I am not).  The outcome here does necessarily imply centralization, since we are guaranteeing that orphan risk costs are significant in relation to the size of the mining industry.
 &gt;  We aren't "using" them for anything.
Please explain what stops the fee falling to zero then?  What is the marginal cost of adding a transaction into a block?  There is this idea people have than we can "use" orphan risk as the cost.

There are two things to consider:
1. System wide fees
2. Your own fees
If you upgrade to SegWit, you can get the benefits of c80% lower fees almost instantly.  For supply and demand dynamics to change and system wide fees to fall, we need to wait for others to upgrade to SegWit, weighted by their transaction usage. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:55:20
Do not forget, if SegWit activates and then you upgrade, you can get a c80% fee reduction right away, even if nobody else upgrades.
SegWit can be activated in just 4 weeks if miners signal.
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:44:57


In my view miner activation is a shortcut mechanism.  All softforks should be decided on by users.  However it can take around a year for users to upgrade. Therefore miner activation was used as a shortcut to get softforks done faster.  I think we should keep the shortcut in place, but then if miners have not upgraded within say 12 months and users have upgraded, the softfork should activate anyway.

Bitcoin is an amazing achievement of economics, computer science, mathematics and engineering.  Its amazing because users across the world, all have consensus about the content of one true database, the blockchain, without a central point of failure.  This amazing thing has been achieved because people across the world all run consensus compatible code.  If people all start running different code, that results in different chains being considerd valid, like you appear to advocate, then the whole project has failed.
This is why we need to achieve consensus first, before we start running code which splits the chain.

It is such a shame that Mike wont engage with this process and instead continues with the divisive and excessive BIP101.  The campaign for BIP101 risks destroying the system and causing delays to a real or interim scaling solution, which we both want.  We both agree predicting the situation in 2036 is inappropriate, so lets take BIP101 off the table now.

@_date: 2015-02-09 22:25:35
Sorry, I was not clear, let me try to explain.
This could increase the number of nodes. Currently miners are often pools and the pools outsource the hashing to other companies who own large amounts of hardware.  These miners or hashing services companies (whatever you call them) typically don't run a full node and the pool operator sends most of the block header to hash.  **If the nonce deterministically generated some historic block and then a hash of this block was required to be in the block header, each hashing entity would be required to store the full blockchain.**  This could encourage more hashing entities to become full nodes and increase the number of full nodes.  This would be easier to implement than your market suggestion, although perhaps not as effective.
I am sure Peter will quickly point out that the above does not require "you to distribute the data to others", but at least it doesn't make things worse.

Exchanges may have a legal and ethical obligation to support both chains, putting the power back in the hands of users and investors 
At least if there is no replay protection, exchanges must support both chains, otherwise they can lose customer funds and become insolvent.
I kindly ask that you add compulsory 2 way replay protection to your hardfork proposal (btc1) to avoid chaos.  Just like the exchanges that you think are so powerful demanded:


However, replay protection is not only about preventing chaos and insolvency of exchanges.  It also makes the hardfork more ethical, it means the hardfork is opt-in for everyone, so everyone needs to opt-in to the new coin and call it Bitcoin if they want, which feels more respectful.
As it stands, I oppose your BTC1 hardfork and plan to sell my holdings in that coin, if possible.  However, if I feel you are being more respectful to users.

I am not assuming the number of blocks per day is constant, for each miner.  But this is a fair industry wide assumption.
I am looking at this issue from the perspective that there is a fundemental problem here.  Miners exist for hashing, yet hashing costs do not increase when adding more transactions to blocks.  The mining industry can not increase hashing as demand increases and then find more blocks, because the difficulty adjusts.

My point is that if there is no blocksize limit, then miners will keep including more transactions in their blocks up to the point where marginal orphan risk cost = marginal mining revenue.  This pushes orphan risk costs up to unecessarly high levels.  This necessarily means orphan risk cost is a large proportion of mining revenue and a significant cost.  Orphan risk costs smaller miners more than larger miners, therefore this policy locks in mining centralisation.
If we have an economically relevant blocksize limit, mining revenue is likely to be much higher than orphan risk, therefore this problem may not occur.
**You say orphan rates will not go crazy huge.  My point is that with no blocksize limit, the economic costs of orphan risk will be necessarily large compared to mining revenue.**

Yes I watched Peters presentation in Montreal.  Please let me explain three points on the idea that orphan risk could create a marginal cost of adding transactions, which could finance mining: 
• Some have argued (Gregory Maxwell1) that if the only significant marginal costs of including a transaction is the orphan risk, then equilibrium difficulty will be too low. The reason is because average transaction fees will be equal to the marginal orphan risk increase and therefore there is no additional revenue to subsidies the cost of hashing. Therefore the equilibrium difficulty will be too low and we have a problem. I am not sure if this is correct because the marginal cost of orphan risk will be unique to each miner, therefore one could draw an industry marginal orphan risk cost curve and some miners would make more profits than others, this dynamic could be sufficient to ensure high enough equilibrium difficulty. Although it implies better connected miners are more profitable and therefore may increase centralization. Although this does make this idea significantly superior to the ideas about arbitrarily fining miners a uniform amount for larger blocks, because this cost is the same for all miners there will be no cost curve and therefore no cross subsidy for hashing, which will result in equilibrium difficulty being too low. 
• Gavin and others have argued that computer science has come a long way in the last 20 years. For example bandwidth speeds and increased and storage costs have come down. This is often cited as a reason supporting BIP101, because transferring 8GB is expected to be much cheaper in 20 years time. I broadly agree with this line of thought. However ironically this makes me more concerned about BIP101, because these technological improvements may mean the marginal cost of orphan risk, when including an additional transaction into a block, will get closer to zero over time or at least become insignificant. Therefore I consider this point a large negative when evaluating the viability of a fee market without a blocksize limit.
• I am also concerned about using orphan risk as the mechanism for ensuring a fee market. Operating this way may imply the orphan risk will constantly be pushed to the limit. This is not good for the health of the network and reduces the ability of the network to effectively and decisively come to consensus about the state of the blockchain. I also consider this point a negative when evaluating the viability of a fee market without a blocksize limit.  Peter R seems to not even think this is a problem and says there is nothing wrong with orphans.

What are you talking about?  This theory only applies when the block reward is insignificant.  What distributed low emission PoW tokens are there?


Why?  Segwit is even the equivalent of an 80% instant increase for a lone upgrader, let alone others upgrading 


What happens if you don't upgrade for a hardfork?  Why do you make the unfair comparison of people upgrading for the hardfork but not upgrading for segwit?  That is a spurious comparison...


How is it a lie?
Assume 65% of a transaction is signature data.  Assume 100% adoption.  So now you get a 95% system wide capacity increase.
Then add average multi signature equivalence and you can get even more capacity.
I want even more capacity than that to.

Please could you fix this too?  As it misses the key point about users benefiting right away and confuses people?
If everyone upgrades, there is a c110% system-wide capacity increase.  If just you upgrade, you also get a c110% capacity increase benefit (c90% if you use "normal" transactions only).  You do not need to hang around waiting for others to upgrade.  Others upgrading just lowers fee rates.

Dear Peter
Thanks for your detailed reply.  In particular thanks very much for the very interesting chart drawing, which while fantastic is certainly not simple.
I am suggesting orphan risk cost will be significant in relation to fee revenue.  I agree that fee revenue will be greater than orphan risk cost, but my argument is that it will be a significant percentage, which is a huge problem.  I have not decided if I agree with Greg Maxwell’s idea that fees will therefore not contribute to security, I think he may be right in some circumstances.  However that is not the main point to my argument.
I have constructed my own image (link below) to try to illustrate my thinking.  In my diagram the orange area represents orphan risk costs, while fee revenue is represented by the orange and yellow area.  As can be seen the orange area is significant in relation to the yellow area, which I think is a large issue, which could cause a catastrophic failure of the system.  This guarantees that orphan risk costs is significant in relation to the industry size, and therefore incentivises a high level of mining centralisation.
The green lines cross where marginal orphan risk cost of a transaction is equal to the fee.  The miner then chooses to make a blocksize where the lines cross. Each user is aware of this and therefore keeps increasing the fee, as time passes, to ensure their transaction is on the left of this point.  As can be seen the “profit” or yellow area is not an order of magnitude larger than the orange area.
The chart makes the following assumptions:
1. The underlying assumption is that users and wallets are operate a mature environment and engage in sophisticated strategies to ensure they pay the lowest possible fee.
2. User wallets analyse the memory pool, have good knowledge about orphan costs and even construct live dummy blocks every few seconds in order to determine the lowest possible fee which ensures the transaction makes it into the next block.  Wallets regularly automatically increase the fee as the memory pool grows, to ensure the transaction is likely to get into the block.
3. The block reward is low and insignificant.  This is a reasonable assumption as the block reward declines exponentially over time and I am looking at this problem from the perspective of Satoshi’s vision of fully incentivising miners from fees.
4. Uniform orphan risk across the industry.  This assumption is likely to be false, however this makes the analysis more simple and I am not sure it affects the conclusion.
5. Only one round is considered.  Due to the inability to decrease fees, if a block is found quickly the miner can include higher fee transactions that did not make it into the previous block.  This is likely to have a material impact on the analysis.  However I do not think the conclusion will be impacted, since this may only be relevant if a block is found in less than 10 minutes and the cases in which this does not occur are likely to be significant.
6. I assume orphan risk increases exponentially as the blocksize increases

I am not saying we need to keep mining revenue at 25BTC.  I am trying to explain that mining revenue is equal to the long term economic value of network security.  If the speed of mining chips double, then from a computer science/mathematical perspective network security has doubled.  However, from an economic perspective, which is also very important, network security is unchanged.  Larger mining revenue therefore implies more economic security, regardless of the hashrate change.
I will try to address your other points later.  My calculation has some assumption that the average transaction size in a larger block is larger, this is the main driver of the non linearity.  i.e. my calculation assumed block size growth was driven by both more transactions and larger transactions, I think using historic trends pro rata accross the c8,000x growth.  Even a linear relationship implies 22 hours to verify.  By the way, I dont know about you, but I do not have clusters of computers at home.
I dont see why your attack block fix is simple.  It requires a precise definition.  Do you agree this should be prioritised ahead of larger blocks, especially if there is a simple fix?
@_date: 2015-10-02 23:47:20
I am not thinking the price per transaction needs to increase nor did I ever say that.
Improving the efficiency of mining hardware is not relevent in the way you describe.  How do the hashing improvments you mention impact the economic value of network security?  Please remember to consider both computer science and economic factors when analysing this. For example the current economic value of security is around 25BTC every 10 minutes, regardless of what happens to mining technology.  This non economic framework you appear to be using may explain most of our apparent disagreements.  The consept of sufficient economic security drives most of my points.
With respect to the G Maxwell quote, I did mean equilibrium difficulty.  Whatever phrase I use people get annoyed.  G Maxwell's idea is that if, for example, all the costs are for orphan risk, which is a real cost, there will be no left over compensation for hashing and the network hashrate will be lower.
Also when I said cost of transmission that includes orphan risk.
If we had 8GB blocks today, the CPU and broadband costs would be huge.  They would be so large they would drawf the tiny fees, the oppersite of what you claim. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:05:28
I think this depends on the price elasticity of demand.  Yes there is a demand curve for which a 1MB limit maximises mining revenue.  I do not think the people in that thread think this will always be the case.
Also your comments in the thread about demand being 10% greater than supply meaning prices increase by 10% is wrong.  This depends on both the price elasticity of demand and supply.

They are complaining the BTC1 hardfork client seems to  activate if Segwit activates **WITHOUT** the bit 4 flag, not with it.  Therefore the description on the BTC1 client is incorrect and confusing


What do you mean it does not exist?  It does.

What???  That makes no sense.  It is about the **actual** rules being resilient to change.  So that new money cannot be created out of nowhere and funds cannot be stolen.  That is it....


Full blocks are both inevitable and necessary whether people want it or not.


I said "significant" minority, not extreme minority.  Yes, want I want is a system where a significant minority can prevent a hardfork.  


What!! You are being stupid now.  What does "hard" money mean?  I want "good" money or "unique" money.  This means your funds cannot be stolen, if money can be stolen from you why is that "hard"?


I never mentioned immutability!!  I am talking about resilient rules.


Please respect those with a different view...


Right...  But I think the incentives may be such that the software people run for their wallets enforces the rules, until there is not significant opposition to enforcing a particular rule.  Either that is the case, or it is not.  Saying its a "social agreement" doesnt change anything.


Well either it keeps succeeding or it fails.  Why would it be good to leave BEFORE it fails?


Me.  For example I oppose a hardfork without replay protection and a 6 month grace period, therefore I oppose SegWit2x.  Many Bitcoin exchanges also said they want replay protection before supporting a hardfork, so there is the exchanges to.

If a hardfrok doubling the blocksize limit from 4MB to 8MB has replay protection, a 6 month grace period and a new bit to avoid confusion for light clients, plus doesnt try to force it on people, I will support it.

Sorry the link is broken.  I do not have another link, but here is the context to the quote saved on my HDD.
 Greg Maxwell:
"To elaborate, in my view there is a at least a two fold concern on this particular ("Long term Mining incentives") front:
One is that the long-held argument is that security of the Bitcoin system in the long term depends on fee income funding autonomous, anonymous, decentralized miners profitably applying enough hash-power to make reorganizations infeasible.
For fees to achieve this purpose, there seemingly must be an effective scarcity of capacity.  The fact that verifying and transmitting transactions has a cost isn't enough, because all the funds go to pay that cost and none to the POW "artificial" cost; e.g., if verification costs 1 then the market price for fees should converge to 1, and POW cost will converge towards zero because they adapt to whatever is being applied. Moreover, the transmission and verification costs can be perfectly amortized by using large centralized pools (and efficient differential block transmission like the "O(1)" idea) as you can verify one time instead of N times, so to the extent that verification/bandwidth is a non-negligible cost to miners at all, it's a strong pressure to centralize.  You can understand this intuitively: think for example of carbon credit cap-and-trade: the trade part doesn't work without an actual cap; if everyone was born with a 1000 petaton carbon balance, the market price for credits would be zero and the program couldn't hope to share behavior. In the case of mining, we're trying to optimize the social good of POW security. (But the analogy applies in other ways too: increases to the chain side are largely an externality; miners enjoy the benefits, everyone else takes the costs--either in reduced security or higher node operating else.)
This area has been subject to a small amount of academic research (e.g.  But there is still much that is unclear."
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:29:04


it is literally more data per block.  what else do you mean by blocksize then?
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:17:27


SegWit increases the amount of data per block.  AKA blocksize limit increase.
The current blocksize limit is 1MB.  SegWit increases it to the following:
     Non witness data (in bytes) * 4 + witness data (in bytes) &lt; 4 million
Therefore the absolute cap on blocksize has increased from 1MB to 4MB.  However, based on estimates of actual transaction usage, this should result in blocks around 2.1MB in size, a 110% systemwide capacity increase.
Please note around 63% of transaction data is witness data.
Please also note that SegWit is a much faster way of increasing capacity than a "simple hardfork to 2MB".  For a simple hardfork we need to wait for everyone to upgrade before we see capacity increases.  With SegWit, each upgraded wallet benefits from a c80% capacity increase as soon as they upgrade, without needing to wait for others to upgrade.  These wallets can then still seamlessly transact with non upgraded wallets, making the upgrade smooth.  This is a vital property as there is likely to be a small long tail of old style transaction lasting many many years.
After SegWit, upgraded nodes see larger blocks, for example 2.1MB.  Old non upgraded nodes see 1MB blocks, which are blocks without the signature data, but still with the inputs and outputs.  Some may think this is a shame as they are totally obsessed with everyone seeing a blocksize limit increase.  However, it is **impossible** to do anything about this, old nodes enforce a 1MB limit, if they want to see larger blocks, they need to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:58:16


But miners are supposed to be running it from Friday this week....
You do know you cant easily make consensus changes after miners are running it right?!!


The concept of doubling capacity is fine (except why double capacity for buggy quadratic hashing transactions?).  The issue is the rushed schedule, lack of a hardfork bit, lack of replay protection and lack of asking for community consensus ect ect ect

 &gt; Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest my chart was "better than yours," only that it was better than the scribbled whiteboard version I showed you from a few days ago. 
Yes, thats what I assumed you meant.
 &gt; The curves in my chart represent the integrals of your marginal curves. Have you read my fee market paper? If you look at just Sections 4 - 6 I think it will be very clear how our charts are related. 
Yes, I read the paper.  It seems our charts are entirely consistent them.
 &gt; I don't know. It's sort of unavoidable, isn't it? 
I do not think its unavoidable that orphan risk cost is significant in relation to industry size.  An economically relevant blocksize limit may mean users need to bid for limited space in blocks, therefore the fee revenue can be &gt; &gt; orphan risk costs. 
 &gt; A block size limit just bends up the supply curve at the limit so that the orphan risk cost is ~infinity for Q &gt; Qmax. 
Sorry, I do not understand this, please explain further?  
If there is a low limit does that not mean orphan risk costs will be low?  For example if in 2030, broadband speeds improve by 100x, the bitcoin price and ecosystem grows 20x, we have a healthy fee market with $20 transaction fees and yet we keep a 1MB limit, does this not mean the orphan risk cost will be very low in relation to the size of the mining industry?  **I am NOT saying we want a 1MB limit and $20 fees in 2030, just giving an example where the orphan risk cost will be low.**
 &gt; I think it might be a problem if the real orphan rates, were, for example 95%, but I don't think that would ever be the case.
 
I am pleased we agree, which just have a different opinion on the size of the problem and have a different assessment on how applicable it is.  Do you agree that orphan risk cost could vary over time as a proportion of revenue?  For example if the cost of propagation becomes more linear with respect to the blocksize, then the orphan risk cost will increase in relation to industry revenue.  **We need to ensure Bitcoin is resilient in all scenarios, as metrics within the system change over time and through cycles, I regard this as a potentially catastrophic risk to the system and must be prevented.**
 &gt; I don't know what will happen when the block reward goes away or **even if it will go away**
Are you suggesting that we keep a permanent block reward?  This is a bad idea for several reasons:
 * The interests of miners and users will not be aligned.  Miners may be less willing to respond to users demands and could even make empty blocks
 * A block reward ensures the mining industry is arbitrarily large and an arbitrarily high level of environmental damage occurs.  We need to ensure the mining industry is eventually limited to the size which supports real transaction demand.
 * It is not clear from a game theory perspective how an inflationary coin can "beat" a coin with a limit of 21 million.  Many users will not be happy.  How can the more inflationary coin "win"?
 * Economists often debate about the merits of inflationary systems versus deflationary systems.  Both sides have a good list of advantages and disadvantages of each system.  One of the main disadvantages of deflation is that with debt based money, the real value of debt increases, which can have a devastating impact on the economy.  With chain based money this problem is unlikely to be significant.  Therefore a deflationary system may be superior, from the point of view of resource allocation and real growth, with chain based money.
I am pleased that you admit you have not thought about the issue of what happens when the block reward becomes insignificant.  Please can you think about this and then review your analysis and potentially re-evaluate.

The reason the Bitcoin blockchain is so unique is becuase there is a distributed consensus algorithm to determine the conent of the database.  By removing this you remove the blockchains unique characteristic.  It then works just like a traditional database.
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:57:37


This is wrong.  The agreement did not commit to do that.  It said, and I quote:


It would be highly unethical and aggressive  to launch a new coin and call it Bitcoin, when there is already a coin called Bitcoin.  That is why a hardfork needs "broad support across the entire Bitcoin community" before being adopted and becoming known as Bitcoin.  A hardfork cannot be arranged in a closed door meeting, without also asking for support across the entire community.
Secondly there was no understanding to do the hardfork 6 months later.  Much of the meeting was spent discussing how post SegWit usage would be monitored and then evaluated for the coming hardfork.  It was expected to occur at least a year later (**or around 15 months later as the timeline in the agreement suggested**)
**HK Agreement Timeline**
 * SegWit is expected to be released in April 2016.
 * The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.
 * **If there is strong community support**, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017.
Source: 
However, unfortunately miners breached the agreement by launching a campaign for a ridiculously stupid hardfork proposal called Bitcoin Unlimited (See median EB attack).  This increased tension in the community and unfortunately  made the   "broad support across the entire Bitcoin community", the agreement committed to, impossible to achieve.


After SegWit the blocksize will already be larger than 2MB.
 
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:51:05
I am not arguing for smaller blocks.
Bandwidth does not determine orphan risk cost as a proportion of fee revenue, in a competitive fee market.  
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:33:21
This has nothing to do with anything I am saying...
However this wasted work is still a problem and major issue.  Although its nothing to do with the point I was making.  My point is about users lowering the fee, to the level where price = marginal cost of including the transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:39:42


YES!! A 100% increase, YES


Using actual data, its 2.1MB equivalent AND 2.1MB of literal data per block


Ok.  But why would you use Bitcoin if your funds are stolen?


How will it attract more money and hashrate if you call something else Bitcoin? Clearly you think its not Bitcoin and that is why you think something else will "get more money".


Yes.  And SegWit uses exactly the same address format as current non SegWit wallets.  It is actually 100% mathematically impossible to determine if its a SegWit address or not.


That is not relevant to SegWit.  Also I would hope you cannot do something like that on the command line for any reasonable wallet


Wrong.  The new address thing is very recent.  It does not increase the amount of data per block.  I also have no idea if it increases capacity either.
The 2MB is for using old address formats


There are currently various transaction formats of various sizes.  SegWit introduces new transaction types.  Some of these are a tiny bit larger and some are a tiny bit smaller than other types.  Overall, its about the same.


I didnt call you a moron.  I am saying "IF" a total moron designed a ridiculous definition of 2MB that made no sense, specifically for the purpose of you winning this argument.  Blocks after SegWit have a data limit over 2MB and an effective size of over 2MB.  There is no getting around that SegWit is literally more than a 2MB limit.


The address thing is new and not relevant.  I am assuming 0% use of those new addresses.


No I do not.  For comparison purposes, SegWit is a faster blocksize limit increase than a simple hardfork to 2MB, for ANY level of wallet adoption.  For example 1%, 8%, 50%, 55%, 92%, 100%.  I do not need to assume 100% adoption.
Of course you can assume people do not upgrade at all, but then ANY blocksize limit increase is impossible
In reality adoption will be skewed towards those that generate transaction data, so we can get to 2MB very quickly.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:32:55


If possible, I will sell my SegWit2x hardfork coins and invest in the legacy chain.  The lower the price of the legacy coins the more potentially attractive it is for me.  
However, this type of trading, uncertainty and swings could be a huge shame for new investors and therefore the integrity of the system.

No BIP-91 can only force a softfork, it can't lock on a hardfork.

Indeed.  But a similar principal applies.  Allowing trading to continue, when its not clear if the Bitcoin is BIP148 or not, is not responsible in my view.
If they suspend trading aswell, I would say that is fine.
However many exchanges have a track record of allowing trading to continue when USD deposits and withdrawals do not work, which makes me concerned they may do this with Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-06 01:53:52

Well its up to us to convince them that supporting a new fork, without replay protection is stupidly dangerous.
If we want Bitcoin to succeed this is it.  Bitcoin won't succeed on its own, it needs a community to support it and fight for it.  Bitcoin needs us now more than ever.  I strongly urge you and other "Bitcoiners" to put in big efforts now, to contact all the exchanges, by email, telephone and even in person.  To travel the world and speak to miners, businesses and exchanges in the next few months.  This is it, this is Bitcoin's big moment we can either give up, or **do whatever it takes to win.**
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:16:29


Ok sorry.  Let me put it this way.  Do you understand why that may be seen as hostile and inspire a defensive response?


And you think this new chain can do replay protection since its a hardfork anyway?  But what if the legacy chain doesn't hardfork?


Competing clients and competing protocol rules are two entirely different things.
Satoshi didn't even want competing clients for wallets, I do not agree with that.  But I certainly think people should rally behind the existing rules to prevent competing rules, which would mean the system does not work as money.

@_date: 2017-07-10 14:10:10
Well Andreas's definition is clearly useful from a policy perspective, as doing anything other than relying on a  market to determine whether a transaction gets into the chain is difficult.  However, we can still **discuss**  people creating transaction data with "malicious intent", for example to drive up fees or bloat the UTXO.  This has certainly occurred, for example people sending small amounts of Bitcoin to outputs where the private key that can spend the money is widely known, creating even more data

@_date: 2017-05-05 14:21:03


If this occurs this will be a huge reduction in the user experience, which won't meet expectations.  Users will not want funds unspendable for 100 blocks with no explanation 
This is why SegWit is such a clever way of increasing the blocksize limit, as transactions can be seamless between upgraded and non upgraded wallets

I am sorry, but please don't be ridiculous.  CWS has come forward saying he is the creator of Bitcoin, and is using this creator status to dangerously try and help encourage people to run incompatible Bitcoin software. CWS is insulting Bitcoin's development team and driving the community apart by manipulating people like Roger Ver into stupid ideas.  At the same time CWS has come forward with either very stupid or obviously fraudulent proofs of being Satoshi.  For example:
* some  kind of confusing webpages with an apparent Satioshi signature as proof, that was just copy pasted from the blockchain
* fake documents claiming to have c1 million Bitcoin, with with PGP keys fraudulently backdated
I think its entirely reasonable for people who support Bitcoin to point out that the guy is clearly a fraudster and try to minimize the risk this conman has on the system.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:54:27

Why not at least allow Bitcoin to work if the cartel breaks down?  Why rely on a cartel to exist, whne we dont have to?
Cartels breakdown all the time.  If we need there to be a cartel for Bitcoin to work, its not sustainable.


The new segwit block weight limit is as follows:
     Non witness data * 4 + witness data &lt; 4 million
If we have a block with 0.38MB of non witness data and 0.62MB of witness data, then the block weight is:
     0.38MB * 4 + 0.62 = 2.14 million
The limit is 4 million, so we have 1.86 million units of spare space
1.86/2.14 = 86.9%
So we have 86.9% more capacity
Get it?


Its a comparison analysis.  P2SH transactions are comparatively more efficient with SegWit than without.  So the relative capacity increase is even larger for these increasingly popular transaction types


But what is 2MB transaction capacity if its not a simple hardfork to 2MB?


Thats a biased view.  And why would they no longer receive blocks?  I will do whatever it takes to ensure the old chain survives if the hardfork is contentious.  I treat that comment as a hostile threat that you somehow dont want me to continue using what I want to use.  Do you not see how that is offensive and hostile?  Please respect what others want to do.  I am happy for you to harfork, so please let me not hardfork away.


They either want more capacity or they dont.  Stop complaining so much about capacity and then say people wont upgrade for more capacity.


No!! I do get an INSTANT 80% fee reduction.
My transaction data is 60% signatures.
If I upgrade, I now take up 40% * 4 + 60% = 2.2 units of block weight, this compares to  4 units of block weight before hand.    So now I can do 1.8/2.2 = 81% more transactions, for the same price!!
This would mean i can almost get 81% more transaction data for the same price, INSTANTLY even if fee market conditions remain EXACTLY the same because nobody else upgrades.


Well that would depend on overall market conditions.


I do not!!  I keep proving the number again and again.  SegWit is more capacity and a faster blocksize limit increase than a simple hardfork to 2MB.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:00:07


Sure.  And if you did measure it in bytes, SegWit is still a blocksize increase.  However you measure it, SegWit is an increase


65% of the data is witness.  Why is the bulk of the data considered non typical?


yes it can...


The same is true for a hardfork blocksize increase, that  also ONLY applies "for those running it".  The old nodes, which by the way barely exists anymore have a 1MB limit, it is impossible to do anything about that.  You are asking for the impossible.


No.  For any definition its an increase.  What about the amount of data per block, is that ok?  On that basis its an increase.

But I guess it doesnt matter, since we know the BU flag is false anyway, why bother discussing any other false flags from the same miners.
By the way, Bitmain also said on "social media" that they are running BU.
(Btw there is also transaction selection policy from Core 14.2 that miners are still apparently running, which even SegSignal is not using, therefore some say some miners are running Core behind a SegSignal or BTC1 gateway node)


That is a consensus change!  Are you saying miners should run one consensus change, then before that change activates run a different set of consensus rule changes?  Is that all part of the SegWit2x plan? 


How is that biased and not facts?
Also I forgot to mention the BTC1 test, where it took c26 hours to mine a block on the testnet, because the devs forgot to update the block production code to match the validation code.  They they blamed an attacker, after admitting the miner was probably running BTC1, is that biased?

Segwit2x does not have overwhelming support.  Actually the economic majority and specifically indicated that they oppose a hardfork without strong 2 way replay protection.  I oppose Segwit2x and will not follow that chain if it forks away.  Doing a hardfork without strong 2 way replay protection right now is highly irresponsible and could cause chaos.  Why do you support this?  Please try to be responsible and demand basic safety mechanisms for a hardfork, like Johnson Lau's Spoonnet.
Please join me in supporting the overwhelming majority of exchanges who  have already insisted on strong 2 way replay protection before listing a hardfork coin of Bitcoin. 


    
Bitcoin Cash has done this, and therefore I genuinely  wish them the best of luck and unlike you won't be "dumping as fast as I can".   However I strongly oppose Segwit2x and see it as dangerous.
Look at another exchange with a recently announced policy:
* **Strong two-way replay protection, enabled by default, such that transactions on each chain are invalid on the other chain.**
* A clean break, such that the new chain cannot be “wiped out” by the original chain.
* A modification to the block header such that all wallets (including light clients) are required to upgrade to follow the new chain.
* A minimum of three months of open testing and review, before the client is formally released and a further three months after this, before the fork activates.
Please join me in the safe hardfork camp and stop supporting these rushed and dangerous hardforks, without basic safety features.

Right, if the miners block these, then the blocks are still essentially full....




Well that is the fair like for liek comaprison for a hardfork!! As that needs everyone to upgrade aswell
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:26:27




Well the softfork could require both bit 1 and bit 4, making your point invalid.  Isnt that what BIP91 does?
To repeat again, miners CAN force a softfork and CANNOT force a hardfork.  But adding bit 1 support does not make that any more true.
 &gt; Please don't try to make communication difficult by pretending that you don't know what I mean.
What?  There are people maliciously spreading false information stating that segwit is not a blocksize increase.  This misinformation is driving the community apart and stalling blocksize increases, resulting in high fees and damaging the user experience.  It is vital to tackle this misinformation


No, not those people, luckily there are not many of those people.  I am talking about the people like me who do want a hardfork


I oppose ransoming the network in principal.  The logic of stalling the network and punishing bitcoin users with high fees, as a levering tactic must be opposed.
Remember, I think that:
1. Everyone DOES want a hardfork
2. The only reason people oppose a hardfork to to protect the network from these aggressive ransom tactics.  If we capitulate the next upgrade could also be used as a ransom, then progress could stall

Despite my response above, unfortunately I feel I have no choice but to put **strongly agree** here.  Given the tension and sentiment in the community, I think the asymmetric advantage this chain has will be too powerful for me to successfully to oppose.  I will feel the need to move my coins to the BIP148 side.  This is a huge shame given the problems this will cause.  Like the wipe-out and loss of funds, particularly damaging for new investors who invest in the non-BIP148 chain.

The RBF stuff is not part of the consensus code, so yes please feel free to do what you like and use alternative implementations.
The blocksize issue is different, as it is consensus critical, if we do not have consensus on the rules of the system, Bitcoin has failed. We need to agree on one version of the chain, this is the core characteristic of the system. Please try to discuss this issue,  but do not implement and adopt a change here before consensus is reached.

That is total nonsense.  The "SegWit address format" is a new thing and you can use SegWit before that new address format is adopted
You CAN spend an output by segregating the witness with the funds going to a new output that CANNOT be spent by segregating the witness.
What you said is totally false.


To use SegWit coins must be moved to a new output which can be redeemed by segregating the witness.  That only needs to happen once!!!  Some people use the network everyday and this can all happen in the first day.  Others use Bitcoin for long term savings, in which case capacity is not much of an issues.
Your need for more capacity is proportional to the transaction volume you do.  **You cannot have it both ways.**  You cannot claim users will take a long time to move their output AND they are doing lots of transactions and need a capacity increase!!!
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:38:28
No horse trading.  Either one likes SegWit or they do not.  The idea of holding the network to ransom, by using an upgrade as leverage to achieve some other objective, must be rejected.  If the community cannot stand up to this, then the system has no monetary integrity.
I support SegWit and I support a hardfork blocksize limit increase.  I do not support any horse trading of this kind, and reject this proposal on those grounds

So you are saying there could be some kind of "defensive" softfork?
Well I guess there could also be a "defensive" hardfork, that required that block to be over 1MB and then enforced the 1MB rule again.  That way this "defensive" chain would retain the wipe-out advantage
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:36:06
That makes no sense.
The Core team has worked hard developing a method of safely increasing the blocksize limit. 
SegWit has many tests, been running on a testnet, deployed the p2p messaging systems in advance on the mainnet, ensures old and new wallets can seamlessly transact, ensures no chain split occurs, ect ect 
Then there is this group who seem obsessed with making a blocksize limit increase as dangerous and reckless as possible.  Now by trying to implement SegWit in a way that results in all the nodes banning messages from the upgraded nodes and banning those clients.  Why do that?  If they hate Core why try activate SegWit?  Either they think it's a good idea or they don't.  Trying to deploy it in a stupid way is unjustifiable.  If you still believe their intentions are good, I am sorry, you are naive.
It is clear now that Jihan and many others are acting maliciously.  Why else does he keep pushing for unecessarily dangerous and stupid methods of increasing the blocksize?

Perhaps we can have a moderate blocksize increase then.  Hopefully it can be done in a patient and calm way.
If Bitcoin succeeds, demand to use the  system could be massive, then we would need a limit and fee market to reduce transaction volume.
@_date: 2015-10-22 21:55:21
Dear Peter
Thanks for your reply.  As one of the leading people behind the idea that orphan risk can be an effective the marginal cost to miners of including a transaction in a block, which ensures a working fee market, I am pleased you have replied.
Firstly a minor technical point, I am strictly speaking about the additional expected orphan risk cost to a miner, of including an additional transaction in a block.  This is slightly different to "orphan rate".
My view is driven by the basic idea in economics, that in a competitive environment price = marginal cost.  I think this is very likely to occur in the market for transaction fees.  For example, in a competitive environment users will only be willing to bid a transaction fee up to the marginal cost to miners of including the transaction, in your case, the marginal orphan risk cost.  This then necessarly implies that orphan risk costs is approximately equal to revenue.  Therefore the orphan risk costs are guaranteed to be hugely significant in relation to the industry size.
You are completely correct in saying this is not how Bitcoin has worked in history.  This is due to the following reasons:
* There is no working fee market
* The mining industry is not that competitive
* Bitcoin is very new and has not proved itself useful yet, therefore currently there is very low demand for transactions and its a niche area.  If Bitcoin is successful, then demand for transactions will be almost infinite, with a low enough fee.
@_date: 2015-10-22 00:44:13
No those additional costs are not relevant here, you need to understand what marginal cost of adding one extra transaction into your block means.  Hard drive cost is not related to that.  The fact that you mention these illustrates that you dont understand my point.  Think of it this way, if there is no blocksize limit and you are a user, you should lower your fee level to just over the marginal cost of orphan risk for miners.
I do not know what is too large, my point is in this case orphan risk cost is necessarily too large, because its almost equal to revenue.
In history demand to use the system has been low, because Bitcoin has not succeeded that much yet.
@_date: 2015-10-21 06:58:38
Power costs do not increase when adding a transaction into a block, orphan risk does.  This is they key point you are missing.
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:36:45
What is too cheap then?  He is those that upgrade will have transactions that are too cheap.  ANY capacity increase requires upgrades.
How else can you interpret that? 
@_date: 2015-11-30 22:54:11
 &gt; Miners will always destroy Bitcoin for short term profits if given the ability to
If miners only care about the short term, they will include all the transactions they can,  however low the fee,  to scoup up all the available fees and maximise short term cashflow.  This potential desire for short term profits is exactly why we need a blocksize limit 
 &gt; This deviates from the original idea 
Incentives transitioning to fees is mentioned in the whitepaper
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:06:05
This is called a market.  There is no "correct" fee.  What if **everyone** paid the correct fee to buy an iPhone or a house?  Wouldn't that price end up being too low?  In the real economy there are not infinite resources and market driven variable prices are used to allocate scarce resources based on who pays the most.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:00:01


Yes, but if you have an HD wallet and use Bitcoin everyday (e.g. businesses), then the next day, you should have all your coins in outputs which can be redeemed by SegWit.  Of course not everyone uses Bitcoin every day like this and some people have long term savings.  But obviously the people using Bitcoin generate the transaction volume...
Either you spend your outputs, in which case they can now be redeemed by SegWit, or you do not spend them, in which case you have no problem with fees.
You only need to spend your outputs once, and then you can fully benefit from SegWit


No,  that is not true.  The person you send funds to does NOT need to have upgraded for you to benefit from SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:20:59


You have to COMPARE it to 2MB!! That is what that statement is.  Its a comparison.  SegWit is strictly a FASTER capacity increase than a simple HF to 2MB.  That is a comparison.  If you dont compare then you cant reply or say anything


No, nonsense.  Firstly that 50% get at least an 80% capacity increase each.  Seocndaly if its weighted by volume, that a c100% systemwide capacity increase.


What are you on about.  Who doesnt get blocks and who gets a full capacity increase?
You get two coins.  Then the smaller block chain maybe wiping out the larger block chain, if its one of those MEGA dump wipe-out hardfork ideas like Bitcoin XT, BU or Classic (ect).  Then you get loss of funds and back to 0% capacity increase.


My wallet does


Well if this doesnt become known at Bitcoin, I consider Bitcoin a failed experiment...  Of course it can fail.


How does that make any sense.  That has no use at all.  For example we at least need coins and transactions right!!!  You speak total nonsense.


You are lying!!
That is a total lie.  Stop spreading lies about SegWit.
1. It has nothing to do with what people you transact with do
2. I go through my UTXO several times a day for non savings
3. Your comments about format are also nonsense
I mean instantly




Average capacity FOR ME, up 80%.  If otehr do not want more capacity fine.  Most of the capacity whining is FUD, so maybe they dont care that much.  It matters to ME, so I will upgrade.


No.  SegWit is a strictly FASTER capacity increase than a simple hardfork for any like for like upgrade schedule.  Its a fair like for like comparison.  You are being unfair trying to assume upgare to a hardfork can be faster.

@_date: 2015-11-06 01:50:24
In a competitive market price = marginal cost of including the transaction.  As technology improves this marginal cost tends to zero and therefore the fee tends to zero.  We therefore require an economically relevant blocksize limit.  This argument does not necessarily imply I think fees should increase from current levels.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:04:58
BIP101 may be better than the status quo to you, but it would still drive the community apart.  But you mentioned you prefer other solutions, I assume you mean BIP100, BIP102 and BIP103.  Please support these consenual moderate proposals instead.  This is the more responsible thing to do, rather than arguing for a more extreme proposal like BIP101.
There are also positives to this debate and many people have been educated more.  We are reduced the amount of unreasonable speculation and expectations about faster or cheaper transactions than centralised systems.
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:49:33
Its difficult to tell when consensus has been reached.  Therefore in general I think we should be more open and move to the position of not banning things.
However in the case of BIP101, it is very clear consensus has not been reached.  For example almost all the major experts and devs, apart from Gavin and Mike favour a more patient stance.  For example:
Wlad (Lead maintainer)
Adam Back (inventor of proof of work)
Nick Szabo (author of the origins of money shelling out)
Cory Fields
Peter Todd
Warren Togami
Pavil Janik

@_date: 2017-07-06 03:02:19
50% guarantees no chain-split, it is still possible to avoid a chain split with less than 50%.


A variety of reasons.  
* In 2012 the P2SH softfork activated at a 55% threshold.  For the next few months this caused several problems with blocks being orphaned as miners were slow to upgrade.  Then 95% was chosen to be **extra safe**, to ensure almost all miners upgraded before the softfork activated and avoid orphan risks
* The 95% threshold has successfully been used 4 times in the past, and for all the activated softforks after 2012.  BIP34 (2012), BIP66 (2015), BIP65 (2015) and CSV (2016).  Therefore, by convention, 95% was chosen for SegWit.
* The 95% threshold is also on "ethical" grounds.  The developers do not want to impose rule changes on the community, its up to the community to ensure they want it by upgrading.
Please note that SegWit is a new safer type of softfork.  The SegWit softfork does not require miner signalling like P2SH, BIP34, BIP65 and BIP66  did.  Therefore the orphan risk is much lower and 95% is even less necessary.  However, in my view a high miner threshold is necessary as a shortcut mechanism to allow the softfork to activate before the community upgrades, if we are willing to be patient and wait, then a high miner threshold is not necessary.  However, the community has already upgraded to SegWit.  Therefore BIP149 could be a safe way to softfork SegWit next year.
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:44:49
At last.  I cannot believe the UASF/BIP148 worked...
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:20:22
No segwit does not do that.  Segwit literally increases the size of the block.  The seat analogy is wrong
Segwit is literally a blocksize limit increase for ANY reasonable definition of blocksize:
* Onchain capacity - segwit increases this 
* literal size of the block  - segwit increases this    
I understand that the capacity and size can be different things, but Segwit increases  BOTH.  
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:17:04


Sure, if people do not generate transactions, then it wont be 2MB.
The LIMIT is OVER 2MB
We are talking about the limit
If people upgrade then over 2MB.  Upgrading is exactly the same assumption for a hardfork
@_date: 2015-03-22 19:58:51
Thanks for your kind response.
Distributed consensus is a new field and has many nuances that are difficult to fully appreciate.  Allowing miners to decide on which chain to work on, is ultimately what Bitcoin is all about.  If miners are punished for changing their minds, such that it becomes unreasonable to change, then miners are not really deciding anything and are not contributing to consensus at all.
The Proof Of Stake proposals, which attempt to solve the "nothing at stake problem" by punishing miners who change their minds, actually destroy the most fundamental part of Bitcoin's consensus mechanism, in my view.
The main potential advantage of Proof Of Stake, as I see it, is that the cost of attacking the network is known and proportional to the value of the network.  In Bitcoin this is not necessarily true, although mining revenue is reasonably related to the value of bitcoin, therefore Bitcoin does have this property, to a limited extent.  In the long run, the hope for Bitcoin is that mining revenue is proportional for demand for security by the entities transmitting transactions, although its unclear to me if the network can ever reach this ideal status.

* For each point we need to have a large campaign about why the HF is unnecessarily stupid compared to spoonnet and say why not just adopt what spoonnet does
* They gradually cave in, point by point
It will be a painful process
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:42:20


That is a good thing.  It makes the hardfork opt-in for everyone and therefore less controversial.  I personally may support that kind of hardfork
Also you could also just ad a bit/string that didnt require light wallets to upgrade.  For example a rule that said miners must include the words "Jihan is the king" in the coinbase.  Non upgraded nodes would not have that in the coinbase and that would provide wipe-out protection 
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:19:11

They should care when customers ask for that money back!!
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:08:37


Well it does free up space for them.  But a hardfork or extension blocks also don't provide an increase for old wallets 


No.  Just large exchanges may quickly upgrade, for example 


No that would be terrible situation.  SegWit avoids these problems and results in a smooth seamless upgrade 
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:04:37


Right...  But so what?  Nobody is stopping you from measuring it in bytes, and if you do, you will see the blocksize increases over 1MB!!!


Right... But 65% of the current bytes are signatures....  And all proper transactions have signatures...  So what is your point? 
65% of the data weights 1, and the new limit is 4 million...


Where did you hear this nonsense from.  I am telling you, this is factually wrong.


Right, they are on a different fork and still only see 1MB blocks!!!
For SegWit, the 95% of upgraded clients see larger blocks and the insignificant minority who havent upgraded see smaller blocks.  This is the same as a hardfork, except these non upgraded clients can seamlessly transact with the upgraded clients for SegWit, so the upgrade is far smoother.


Its factually wrong.  Yes there has been a misinformation campaign, but that does not make it correct


That is the same for any blocksize limit increase, even a hardfork.  As I explained, old clients enforce the 1MB limit, there is nothing we can do about that except ask those people to upgrade.  You are asking for the impossible.


No, for any definition, its a blocksize increase.  Its literally more data per block, that is pretty clearly a blocksize increase.
Let me state a simple fact:
* After segwit the maximum amount of data per block is greater than 1MB
Do you agree with this fact or not?
See this testnet block
It is 3.7MB in size.  3.7 &gt; 1....
How in gods name, is that not a blocksize increase?
One must be almost totally insane to claim that 3.7MB of data is not an increase compared to a 1MB data limit

Well I wouldn't think it is "the most exciting innovation of our lifetime" if a contentious hardfork can take the Bitcoin name...


Yes.  In my view a **significant minority** should be enough to prevent a hardfork becoming the new Bitcoin, for Bitcoin to be unique.  After-all, only a minority of people were unhappy with quantitative easing.  Quantitative easing was imposed on a minority by a super majority, Bitcoin needs to be resilient to that.


If that is true and Bitcoin does have this property, then why should I leave?  I should only leave if Bitcoin does not have the feature.
You may think that's a narrow perspective.  I think all other interesting characteristics flow from this. 


Many oppose the change, and some people are trying to impose this on them.  That is the point.  
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:47:34


1. That is not true.  Non mining nodes that enforce the existing 1MB rule do need to upgrade, or they will follow a different chain
2. Actually, if replay protection is implemented, which is absolutely necessary for a hardfork to avoid total [chaos]( then yes, ALL wallets, even light wallets do need to upgrade and opt-in to the hardfork.  Actually exchanges demanded exactly this:


Source: 


That is not true.  For a "normal " transaction c62% witness data.


The more volume you do, the more you pay in fees, the greater the incentive to upgrade.


As I explained, you can do c85% more volume for the same price, even if you assume nobody else upgrades to SegWit and fee levels remain unchanged.  Is 85% minimal?


Roll back risk is not unique to SegWit!! If miners are going to do a big roll back, deactivate SegWit and then steal loads of funds, then MANY people will lose funds, not just SegWit users.  For example any exchange that received user deposits in the period, ect ect.  Or miners could transfer funds to exchanges, buy Ethereum or USD (then withdraw from the exchange) and then do a roll back and make profits.


No it is not!!  That is why SegWit is so great.  Users opt-in to the change to get more capacity.


I was talking about an 80% capacity increase, I was not talking about hashpower


To repeat again.  I personally get a large capacity increase, even if nobody else does upgrade.


It does make sense.  I segregate my own witness therefore I get more capacity.  It means I get to do more transactions for the same price.
For example if an amusement park added more rides, users can opt-in to riding the new rides and benefit from more capacity.  Of course, guests do not have to use the new rides 


No, I mean you get the main bulk of the SegWit benefits.  Actually everything expect a feerate reduction
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:45:58


This is a huge oversimplification and there are many issues, but I am not sure why you have an /s there
Lets say a miner has a 40Mb/s connection, with $30 a month (That is 5 MB/s)
    10MB/5 =  2 seconds to download a block
    2 seconds / 600 seconds (target time) = 0.33%
If one does a proper Poisson analysis, that could increase to 0.6% (since its the FIRST 2 seconds)  In a low margin industry, 0.6% lower margins can be significant.
Of course this ignores a whole set of complex things such as:
* Worst case latency
* Block verification times
* Firewalls
* Compact Blocks

Thanks for this.  I think Yanis makes a very interesting point about the 1929 crash and how with Bitcoin there is no safety net for banks, which could be a large problem.  However, this is analysing the banking system using the conventional framework.  What Yanis fails to appreciate is that Bitcoin has some characteristics which make it fundamentally different from other forms of currency and thus a totally different analysis of the banking system may be required.  I will try to explain below.
The core characteristic of the traditional banking system, is banks’ ability to expand the level of credit in the economy, by creating new loans and increasing deposits.  This is a core driver of modern economies and a key reason for financial regulation.  There is a risk banks lend out too much money in a credit boom and thus a safety net may be required to bail out the banks.  In the context of Bitcoin, it is important to understand the reason banks have the ability to expand credit, which is because users treat bank deposits in the same way as cash, enabling banks to expand loans and therefore deposits, at will.  People treat banks deposits this way for perfectly reasonable and logical reasons, in fact banks deposits have some significant advantages over cash, which I will try to explain below.  Many of these advantages either don't apply or only partially apply in Bitcoin.  There is no conspiracy or master manipulation by the financial elites; it’s very much a product of the nature and characteristics of most forms of money that bank deposits are simply better than cash.
Bitcoin has at least five properties (listed below) which provide some level of natural resilience against credit expansion, which traditional money does not have.  This does not mean there cannot be a few dominant Bitcoin banking institutions engaging in credit expansion, it merely means Bitcoin may be more resilient to this than more traditional forms of money.
**1. Security**
Keeping money on deposits in financial institutions, increases security relative to keeping large physical cash balances at home
Bitcoin can allow a high level of security, whilst the user maintains direct control of the money without using third party financial intermediaries
**2. Convenience**
Using the banking system, it is possible to send money effectively over the internet or by phone, for example.  If physical cash is used, then a slow, inefficient, insecure physical transfer must take place
Bitcoin can allow users to efficiently transmit money over the internet or even phone, whilst maintaining direct control of the money and without using third party financial intermediaries
**3. Easy to exit**
In the traditional banking system, withdrawing physical cash from a financial institution is a long administrative process which takes time
Bitcoin can allow users to withdraw money from deposit taking institutions quickly, which may encourage banks to ensure they have adequate money in reserve at all times
**4. Auditability**
Traditional banks offer the ability to track and monitor all transactions, which can help prevent fraud and improve accountability.  This is important to many businesses and physical cash cannot offer this
Bitcoin’s blockchain can allow users to effectively audit all transactions, without using third party financial intermediaries
**5. "Hybrid banking" models** (perhaps the most significant)
In traditional banking models there are only two fundamental choices, 1. Physical cash which provides full user control of the money, and 2. Money on deposit at a financial institution
Bitcoin allows a wider spectrum of deposit and security models, resulting in a more complex credit expansionary dynamic
Please see some examples below of "hybrid banking" models:
* Full user control of the money, where only the user holds the private key. e.g. Bitcoin Core, Blockchain.info
* 2 of 2 multi signature wallets, such that both the user and financial intermediary must sign a transaction	e.g. Greenaddress.it
* 1 of 2 multi signature wallets, such that either the user or the financial intermediary must sign a transaction	 
* 2 of 3 multi signature wallets, such that two of the user, a hash of the users password and the financial intermediary must sign a transaction e.g. Coinbase Vault
* n of m multi signature wallets, such that…	 
* Hierarchical deterministic wallets, such that a root private key can generate branches of junior private keys…
* Hierarchical deterministic multisignature wallets, such that...	 
* Traditional banking model e.g. Circle, Coinbase

Justusranvier, ok, I agree that the 21 million bitcoin or 2.1 quadrillion satoshi limit cannot be considerd an arbitrary constraint or limit, as any number could have been chosen.  In a sense it can even change in that perhaps the divisibility could be increased.
However there are many of examples of arbitrary limits which were chosen, as I said in my response to your essay. 10 minutes, 2 weeks, four years and the block reward amount, for example.

Lets say there is a crisis or ambiguity, like the August 2010, March 2013 or July 2015 Bitcoin crisis.  Miners are incentivised to fix the problem ASAP to avoid losing money.  If miners are not doing it for profit and instead just have a small device they dont really care about.  They can just sit around in the pub and not bother about fixing their mining device.

Please try think about this issue very carefully.  With respect to XT, XT nodes accept a 1.1MB block as valid, whilst existing nodes regard this block as invalid.  We could then have a chainfork, where the network catastrophically splits into two.  Then we have two coins.
Do you see how this is a fundamentally different concept to any concerns one has about RBF?  RBF is just a methodology for handling transactions.  RBF has nothing to do with the consensus rules for determining the valid blockchain.  Anyone can be free to implement whatever RBF or non RBF policies they like and this won't impact consensus.

I was thinking of comparing new P2WPKH and P2WSH to old pre segwit transaction (either P2SH or not).  Are you saying P2WPKH and P2WSH transactions must be much larger than 250 bytes and therefore the comparison does not work?  What is your point here?


But do you need to use this new address format in order to get the benefits of more capacity?  I thought this new address format is to improve user convenience and error detection.  I didn't know this also helped capacity.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:51:28


It is about the rules being resilient to change, such that arbitrary changes cannot be made to the money without widespread support across the ecosystem.
Just like the whitepaper said:


The ability for users to verify the rules and prevent arbitrary rule changes, so that for example their money cannot be stolen, is the only thing that makes Bitcoin unique or interesting, as a form of money.  Without that property, I might as well use the USD.
If a contentious hardfork like SegWit2x succeeds and becomes known as Bitcoin, it is very naive to think that one day another hardfork, to steal user funds or create more inflation wont also succeed.  In that case, what is the point?
@_date: 2016-05-30 06:15:21
Well Brian (The Coinbase CEO) produced this slide, to describe what he thought was healthy competition between Classic and Core, by comparing it to web browsers.  Despite the fact that web browsers do not need consensus, like Bitcoin.
In this slide he makes it seem compatible implementations like BTCD are equivalent to deliberately incompatible clients like Classic:
Brian seems to totally misunderstand how Bitcoin works, he doesnt understand that we need consensus on one chain, which is the whole point of Bitcoin.  Yet despite this he attacks the Core team and is attacking the network and encouraging others to participate in his attack.
@_date: 2017-07-18 09:39:46


Errr, I don't think so.
It could just be a flag day or make the upgrade linked to the "flagging".  For example for SegWit, instead of a flag there could be a witness commitment or something.  Sure miners could still fake it, but that would take more effort.  If one is so skeptical that one thinks miners would fake even that, then I guess miners can't really assist with making upgrades smoother. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:23:49


No its a fact.  I will store MY music files on the blockchain


How?  By charging a fee?  By having a cartel?  If we rely on a cartel, then we NEED mining to be centralized.  I am not interested in that Bitcoin either.
But this is STILL full blocks.  If we have a cartel doing this and setting a limit, blocks are still full.


So we NEED miners to push orphan risk cost right to the limit?  Such that total orphan risk cost is large relative to total fee revenue?  This guarantees that larger miners have a significant comparative advantage due to lower propagation costs.  This locks in mining centralisation unnecessarily. I am not interested in that Bitcoin.  I won't invest in it.  That is my right.
Also this is still full blocks.  If blocksize is pushed right to the limit of marginal orphan risk cost, they are still then full.  There is still a limit that is reached.
Also orphans are a negative on the network and we should try to reduce them not increase them.  For example the negative consequences of wasted work lowering security.




It depends on the type of transactions people use for your comparison.  Both with current blocks and the new larger block.
Based on current actual data, it is both the equivalent capacity of 2.1MB blocks and 2.1MB of actual data
   
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:28:37


No.  After segwit the blocksize increases.  Why would you not count signatures as part of the block?  Currently blocks are around 65% of block space is signatures and this is counted in the old 1MB limit.
After Segwit the old 1MB limit is removed and there is a maximum  of 4MB of space available. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:39:08


I doubt that.  It seems like the signatories had no idea what they were signing, which is why James Hillard had to save them

So are you saying custodians can just discard customer Bitcoin and that customers have no protection?
I do not see why anything needs defining.  If a custodian holds something on behalf of someone else.  The customer legally owns the asset and the custodian must protect it.
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:09:20


This is wrong.  Segwit does not reduce the transaction size.  Segwit introduces new ways of spending Bitcoin.  Some of these new ways are slightly larger in size and some are slightly smaller in size, depending on what you compare it to.
On average there is no reduction in transaction size
Segwit literally increases the amount of data per block and is an ACTUAL &amp; REAL blocksize limit increase.  This blocksize limit increase is the only way Segwit improves capacity 
       
@_date: 2017-07-10 10:57:13


Well, its expressed multiple ways.  Both are valid concerns.  However, do you not see the point that anyone that wants to benefit instantly, can do so?


That is a spurious comparison.  A "straight max block size increase" also requires users to upgrade, exactly the opposite of what you assumed when saying the SegWit blocksize increase is slower.
In reality SegWit is much faster, as those responsible for more transaction volume are likely to upgrade faster.  This then has a greater impact on capacity.

 &gt; I agree. [Here]( is a better chart I recently made to illustrate this point.
Please explain what the two lines on your chart are, you have "available revenue" and "production cost"?  In my chart I distinguish between marginal cost (MC) (dark green) and average cost per byte (yellow).  At the same time I distinguish between marginal revenue (MR) (light green) and average revenue per byte (orange). Miners produce where MC = MR, however the total costs and total revenue are determined by the rectangle formed from the average cost per byte and average revenue per byte lines at that point.
I am pleased you agree that orphan risk cost will be significant in relation to fee revenue.  Do you consider this a major problem?  Many advocates of larger blocks now claim technological improvements may make orphan risk low, however this system ensures orphan risk is significant in relation to the size of the mining industry.
  &gt; I think the orphaning cost is the area under the dark green curve, while the fee revenue is the area under the light green curve.
Yes this is completely correct and completely consistent with my chart.  My chart contains the average cost and average revenue curves, which allows the areas to be displayed as rectangles.
As for  as I explained I am looking at this problem in the context of Satoshi's desire to have "incentives transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free".^1  I think this is desirable for a number of reasons, mostly to align the interests of miners and users and the block reward does decrease exponentially over time.  If you do not like this assumption then maybe we are trying to solve different problems.

Yes, its also important to point out, that making a 4MB block full of signature data, is exactly the opposite of what a spammer would want to do.
Lets look at what the objective of a spammer may be:
1. Drive up transaction prices (The attack vector "big blockers" seem most concerned about) - for this objective, the spammer is NEUTRAL (at worst) between choosing witness and non witness data
2. To bloat the UTXO - for this objective, the spammer prefers NON WITNESS DATA
3. To increase verification time - for this objective, the spammer prefers NON WITNESS DATA
4. Take up long term storage - for this objective, the spammer prefers NON WITNESS DATA, since witness data can more easily be discarded with no loss of security relative to the current model of not checking old signatures. (Al;though some may disagree with this point, long term storage costs are cheap)
Also, remember if a spammer wants to make 4MB blocks, they still need to pay up and outbid other users.

What no!  I have not been pushing an aggressive blocksize limit increase, which has blocked a safe blocksize limit increase
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:25:15
Many people discussing Bitcoin or associated distributed consensus mechanisms may have some kind of financial interest or bias and this is a valid concern.  Personally I hope I am not biased, but I am pretty confident I have no particular financial interest against the block size limit increase, by investing in some other system, either intellectually or with real value.
I accept that many valid counterarguments have been put forward, that is why I say many of the disadvantages are speculative or outweighed by positives.  My personally opinion on this issue changed dramatically after I learnt about IBLT, for example.  With respect to the free market idea, I cannot remember many robust counterarguments against the “mining is a positive externality issue”, please can you remind me of the main ones again?    Remember I am not saying this will cause a lack of mining incentivsation which will be catastrophic to Bitcoin, merely that it is a valid concern which requires consideration, although I acknowledge that on balance the advantages of increasing the block size limit are larger, in my view.  We need to always be looking for potential risks in the network, particularly security risks.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:04:58
BIP149 does not orphan blocks that don't add a segwit flag.  This is just like segwit itself.  Segwit is not compulsory for miners 
I tried to explain this here:

I will be fighting hard to ensure that hardfork coin doesn't become known as Bitcoin.
I kindly ask that you please join me.
When we do the hardfork let's have a year of testing, a hardfork bit, compulsory two way replay protection and a calm collaborative environment without threats     
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:28:33
You:  In the absence of the actual code, though, "the community" can't decide shit.
Me: Please stop spreading the fake divisive rumors that Code developers are not writing hardfork code.
You: I've said nothing of the sort
Yes you did, you did imply Core developers have not written hardfork Code....


It is not just about being "successful", if it does that in a way I think destroys any interesting properties of the system, then I am not interested in the system...
Me: Why choose one without replay protection?
You: Simply because I honestly don't believe we'll need it. The FUD campaign against 2x will continue to be quite ruthless
Me: You think replay protection is FUD!!
You: I said no such thing.
You did say exactly that, as the quotes above show.  If you believe replay protection risk is not FUD, please join me in supporting safe hardforks with replay protection...


I never said that.  Stop twisting my words.  I find it offensive that you think my chain will not survive and therefore replay protection is not necessary.  That is not the same as saying your new coins wont be successful.
But then perhaps you do not mean that replay protection risk is FUD and you do think its necessary now?  Which is it?


I am being realistic.  If you support dangerous hardforks based on the ridiculous assumption the legacy chain will not survive, despite others telling you they will support the legacy chain, that is arrogant.
Instead why not support a safe hardfork based on the assumption that the legacy chain MIGHT survive.  If you are cautious enough to do that, you may be seen as less arrogant and your hardfork is more likely to succeed.


Good, I have no problem with that.  What makes you think I have a problem with that?
You seen to assume MY chain won't even survive!!  Why?
If we want to move off in different directions why not?  Lets just peacefully divorse!!
Why do people insists on making the divorce as messy and stupid as possible, first without wipe-out protection and now without replay protection.
But dont you get it, if everyone commits to making the hardfork safe and clean, WE DO NOT EVEN NEED A DIVORCE!!!  The divorce is completely pointless. Why do you guys insist on making the hardfork as dangerous as possible?  Just commit to a **safe and patient** hardfork and end this stupid war!!
You do not need Core to do anything.  Lets just sign a basic statement:


What is wrong with that?  Why do we need "Core" to do anything to agree to that?
Please stop these dangerous rushed hardforks and lets get a safe hardfork done

To me this sounds like jumping out a plane and then saying there are thousands of possible unknown options.  I would prefer to have a solid robust option before jumping out of the plane


Everything I say is my opinion.  Facts and opinions are not mutually exclusive either.  I said something  the idea of non full blocks is a nonsense.  I stand by that.


No SegWit is faster.  In any like for like percentage upgrade scenario segwit is faster.  Stop spreading lies about a hardfork being faster.
If you assume 100% upgrading for the hardfork, assume 100% upgrading to SegWit.  If you assume 50% upgrade for SegWit, assume 50% for a hardfork.  That is the fair way of comparing.  Your analysis is spurious


I sure hope so.... Otherwise we need an emergency PoW change.  Would be a huge crisis


Only because the majority hashrate could softfork to ban me!! they cannot hardfork me


What! Instant when it happens!! Obviously!!!  Not instant now...


There will be a very long tail.  But the bulk of volume can upgrade very fast.  e.g. to c2.1MB in a few months


What lie?  This:


I stand by that.  It is literally totally faster, for any given level of like for like adoption.  Of course you could assume 100% upgrade to the hardfork and 2% upgrade to SegWit, but that would be an idiotic comparison.
But even if 2% upgrade to SegWit, I still benefit from 80% lower fees!

Well BIP148 can be very powerful and coercive on those that don't upgrade, due to its wipe out advantage.  This can cause a wipe out of the non BIP148 chain and a loss of funds.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:11:11


Perhaps, but as a custodian I think they **should** do this type of thing.
For example, if you are a custodian of stocks and shares, on behalf of retail investors.  You should not complain, "oh its so difficult, there is constant mergers, acquisitions and share splits, companies are doing this all the time, we cannot keep track."  I am sorry, but that is their responsibility as custodians.
At least if Bitcoin Cash includes strong 2 way replay protection and other basic safety mechanisms (a modification to the block header such that all wallets need to upgrade), then I think custodians should at least try to protect it for customers.  I think a good policy could be as follows:
1. Take a snapshot of all balances at the hardfork date
2. If in a few months time the new coin is still around and has a market capitalization of c5% of Bitcoin or more (and significant trading volume), then the custodian should transfer all the Bitcoin to new outputs
3. The custodian can then run the client of the new coin, with no risk to Bitcoin since keys cannot leak.
4. Then, if it is reasonably safe to do so, allow customers to withdraw their new coin from their accounts
This policy has greater clarity, and makes it clear the custodian has no intention of stealing customer funds.
For example, I think this BitMEX statement is good:
In contrast, since the SegWit2x hardfork has no replay protection, I think custodians should refuse to support this new coin, since it may be too difficult to protect client funds
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:40:25
That is not what the devs said
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:30:54


Well, my suggestion is that they only do this a maximum of say once every 3 to 6 months, no matter how many coins are launched.
I also suggest they move the BTC first, ensuring no risk to the actual Bitcoins.


That may be the point of Bitcoin, but if some other forked coin has value, that is reality and exchanges should reflect that reality.
If exchanges do the following:
Demand all fork coins do the following:
* Modify the block header such that **all** wallets need to upgrade to use the new chain
* Implement strong two way replay protection
And then, only make efforts to return client funds after 3 months, if these policies are followed, that should discourage forked coins.
This way exchanges avoid customers complaining at them saying they are stealing their money
@_date: 2017-05-08 07:12:50
No....  The statements used to demonstrate opposition to BU, are a good example to follow for support for a UASF
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:36:00


That is not true either


There is not such thing as a "SegWit transaction" like you imply, an output is either redeemed by segregating the witness or not.  A transaction can include spending coins from many outputs, some or all of these outputs could be redeemed by segregating the witness, or some or all of them could be spent without segregating the witness.  You get the full benefit of SegWit regardless of where you send the coins to.  Actually, at the time of creating the transaction, you may not even know if the receiving address can spend the coins with SegWit or not.


Yes.  Some people will having coins in savings accounts for decades.  So what?  As I say:


@_date: 2017-07-28 07:18:23


Don't they also have a wider duty of care to their customers, to distribute any asset you have rights to, if safe and practical?
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:31:35
In my view that would be irresponsible.  Also the NYA never said they would de-list the original coin, only "support the activation of a 2 MB hard fork within six months".  Who knows what that means, they could just "support the activation" of it and then continue to list the original coin as Bitcoin. 
The agreement also said it would be a parallel upgrade with SegWit, this is now out the window, since the BTC1 code at the time BIP91 activated was nowhere near good enough for a new coin launch and the lead developer has even mentioned a lot of changes to occur.  It looks rushed like Bitcoin Cash, except Bitcoin Cash has much better safety features.
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:30:34


I am not sure if that is true, apparently there was a large mempool on the testnet.  By default the miner would not construct a block bigger than 1MB

Yes you do:
THIS IS AN OPTION: 
(Please note, I do not support BIP91 or BIP148, but they are options)


What lock-in?  SegWit2x will apparently follow the HF chain and Segsignal will not.  But neither lock anything in.


Well there is an issue, if miners all claim to be running BIP91 and then don't produce the BIP91 chain.  The ecosystem looks stupid....


Yes you can, there are various ways:
* Transaction selection
* Not using the deafult bits for BIP91/BTC1, but still using bit 4
These things appear to be going on

I sent some Bitcoin to an exchange that says they support BCH already.  I do not know if this will be possible, but my plan is to try and sell some BCH even before the first block

There already is a 1MB limit
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:59:15
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:14:07


Really?  It looks like many are false flagging and not running BIP91 software.  Even from looking at the version bits.  
For example look at Antpool, what BIP-91 client has the v20000010 flag? (neither BTC1 or SegSignal right?)  Also Antpool still has the BU flag, are you claiming BU has implemented BIP91 or SegWit2x?  Also Antpool added this flag that BTC1 doesn't produce before BTC1 was released, so who knows what they are running! How does that look like a success?
But then again, miners have been false flagging for ages, so I guess neither of us can draw any conclusion other than version bits no longer work for upgrades as miners just false flag all kinds of contradictions.
But a hardfork also requires non mining nodes to upgrade.  Both relay nodes and user wallets.  If they do not want to, perhaps because of a lack of tests, they will not. I certainly will not.
BIP91 is not very contentious either.  Both sides of the scaling war seem to support BIP91. (Although I oppose it)


Consensus rule changes?  You want to rush out more consensus changes?  This illustrates why I oppose SegWit2x!!  First you do all the development and tests and THEN you get people to run it.  That is how you keep the network working safely!!!


Really?  Garzik first attempt kept the 4M weight limit in the validation file and didn't even know that meant it wasn't a hardfork.  Then the SegWit2x notes and proponents keep saying the hardfork is activated by bit4, even though the code activates the hardfork WITHOUT bit 4 being used, causing confusion and demonstrating the devs don't understand how their own hardfork works !  Then today the BTC1  team seemed to forget they need a P2P network for their BIP91 blocks and Matt/Greg had to remind them and update the relay network!

So a fee cartel?  Where miners orphan blocks with low fee transactions?


Getting somewhere


My point is SegWit is both a larger AND faster blocksize limit increase than a "simple hardfork to 2MB".  When people say "SegWit is not really 2MB", what do they mean?  Are they not comparing it to a simple hardfork?


Why does SegWit give any less of a hint.  Actually its less hostile and people do not like being told what to do.  So they may upgrade faster.


I think transaction volumes weighted percentage matters, since wallets that do more transactions have more of an impact and these wallets are also more incentivised to upgrade.  On a transaction weighted basis, I think the upgrade can be very fast.  e.g. equivalent 2MB blocks within a few months
But I care about is my INSTANT 80% fee reduction.  That is why I want SegWit.  If other people take a few months to give an extra 30% or so of bonus system wide capacity, I don't really care.  80% &gt; 30%

I mentioned compact blocks in my comment.  I said my comment was a simplification 
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:01:14


If miners impose a 3MB limit and we have 3Mb blocks.  Blocks are still full


Lets call it 62%
4 * 0.38MB + 0.62MB = 2.14M of block weight
This allows for 4/2.14 = 86.9% increase, or 1.87MB blocks.
Then add P2SH comparison, and it doesnt seem that hard to climbe a tiny bit more to 2.1Mb does it?


My point is, you say 100% upgrade is unrealistic.  I say, ok, well 100% upgrade is also unrealistic for a hardfork then.  


Its MORE than 2MB

Absence of what code?  Please stop spreading the fake divisive rumors that Code developers are not writing hardfork code.  There is loads of published code for countless hardforks.  Your fake rumors are driving the community apart.


Why don't you join me, and we can promote safe hardforks together without waiting for Core.  But NOT as leaders or champions, if you want money with a leader, use the USD.  The USD not only has leadership, but the leaders were elected in democratic elections by the people that use the currency, a currency with unelected, unaccountable and illegitimate leaders has no chance compared to the USD.
What makes Bitcoin unique is that there are no leaders or champions.  The rules can only be changed in a bottom up way, peer to peer, with no significant opposition from the community.


You think replay protection is FUD!!
The Ethereum hardfork had c95% miner support at the time of activation and developer support, as well as support from the "leader" (Vitalik).  And yet exchanges lost funds due to replay.
This Bitcoin hardfork does not have developer support, and people are much more patient and passionate in Bitcoin than Ethereum.  Of course two viable coins will come out of the hardfork.  Not only this, but the "cat is out of the bag" now, everyone knows you can make profits doing replay, which will just encourage it.
I find your comments, both complacent and offensive.  I find it offensive that you think the coin I know and love will have such little support that it won't even exist.  Why do you feel the need to be offensive.
I can promise you this.  I will do whatever it takes to ensure my Bitcoin continues, no matter what.  I think I will succeed, but if I fail, then fine, Bitcoin has failed to me.
And anyway, even if you think replay vulnerability is FUD, what is the disadvantage of adding a fix to it?  There isnt one!!  I hope that this kind of arrogance and stupidity ensures this latest dangerous hardfork attempt fails to be known as Bitcoin, just like XT, Classic, BU and ABC.
Then finally hopefully you will join me in campaigning for a safe hardfork
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:11:02


But they reached an apparent resolution without discussing it with the technical community, resulting in an unnecessarily dangerous hardfork.  For example:
* It is rushed, with only apparently 3 days until the final version is released, when a safe hardfork should require at least a year of development and testing.  For example all kinds of issues need to be addressed, activation logic, hardfork bit, replay protection, wipe-out protection, new seed nodes, testing of new blocksize limits, testing new worst case verification times, changing validation code, changing block creation code ect ect.  Why rush this so quickly? It is grossly irresponsible
* There is no replay protection, which may result in chaos.  Especially since the "cat is out the bag now".  As soon as the hardfork happens, people may try to replay attack and get free money.  I personally get emails from people who do not understand Bitcoin asking "how can I profit from the hardfork".  Why are we planning for such an unnecessary chaotic mess?
Please join me in supporting safe hardforks, with a calm and patient testing schedule, with strong replay protection, with a hardfork bit so light clients need to opt in for the fork, ect ect
Its called Spoonnet, by Johnson Lau.  Lets end this madness of choosing technically inferior hardforks for stupid political reasons, and do a safe hardfork with consensus.

Right.  But even if fee market rates remain the same, typical lone upgraded users benefit from c90% more capacity and DO NOT need to hang around waiting for others to upgrade.  Right?

It is a fact if I fill them up...


Both are important


You cannot force people to update...  I thought you want a hardfork to be opt in?


No it does not.  The more upgrade, the more capacity.  Just one upgrader creates more capacity.


2.1MB based on actual historic data


Its more capacity.  Waht do you want, more capacity, or larger blocks for the sake of it.
What if we "compromise" and add the same 4MB mp3 version on John Lennons Imagine to every block.  Would you be happy with that large 4MB increase?


I told you, its based on ACTUAL data
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:58:35


Miners have been clearly been irresponsibly been false flagging all kinds of bits for years now, often in some kind of apparent political move.  This method no longer works as an upgrade mechanism for soft or hard forks, in my view, whatever "bit 4" means. 
For example, many people are currently doubting if miners are either running btc1 software or other BIP-91 compatible software, despite the flags.
We need to find a new way of doing upgrades, perhaps involving miners in a different way without adding bits to the block header or avoiding using miners at all.
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:21:30
OK.  After arguing with you I have decided to review the actual BTC1 code:
As you can clearly see [here]( the BTC1 client DOES indeed flag bit 1 **before** BIP91 activates:
        // Deployment of SegWit (BIP141, BIP143, and BIP147)
        consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_SEGWIT].bit = 1;
        consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_SEGWIT].nStartTime = 1479168000; // November 15th, 2016.
        consensus.vDeployments[Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_SEGWIT].nTimeout = 1510704000; // November 15th, 2017.
Do you finally accept this?
BTC1 is a software fork from Bitcoin Core, which does flag bit 1.  This flag was NOT removed.  New code was added to also flag bit 4 and then if BIP91 activates orphan non bit 1 flagging blocks.
But the original code from Core flagging bit 1 remains in the BTC1 client.

No, this assumes transactions are 60% signatures....


I do transactions everyday.  As soon as I upgrade, within a few hours, all my outputs will be in new UTXOs


Yes, my savings have UTXOs that are many years old!!  But I do not care about the fees on my long term savings, yes it may take me many years to upgrade the UTXO of my savings. This is exactly why we need to make sure old and new wallets can seamlessly transact and why SegWit is such a brilliant and non disruptive idea.  Because people will make a small number old format translations for many years to come and SegWit is fine with that. 
I care about the high fees I pay today, almost $40 a day, that I pay on my day to day transactions, not my savings.  For these transactions, I save 80% right away with SegWit


Yes SegWit does help, as others upgrading to SegWit creates more fee space for your old redemptions!!!  SegWit is truly a perfect Win Win!!  There are no losers.


That is not true.  SegWit makes a future blocksize limit hardfork both safer and more likley.  For example it solves the quadratic hashing bug, which many feel makes a blocksize limit increase unsafe.
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:45:27
Miners should follow financial markets  more than some closed door agreement   
And even if the legacy chain doesn't retake the lead, spv wallet users still get replay attacked

Selfish mining risks may be substantially increased in this scenario
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:22:35


I do not think we should PoW change unless miners attack the main chain such that  malicious orphaning occurs, for example.  I do not see why we should do a PoW change just because some miners will not enforce new rules the community wants.  If the community wants these new rules, we should, in a well coordinated and planned way, begin enforcing them.
If miners do not want to enforce SegWit's rules, then users should enforce these rules.  With BIP148, we require miners to add a flag saying they will support SegWit's new rules and non upgraded miners, by default, do not have that flag.  If a majority of miners do not upgrade, this would necessarily cause a chainsplit.
If the users just decide to enforce SegWit rules, then even if a majority of miners do not upgrade, this will not necessarily cause a chainsplit.  To cause a chainsplit miners must upgrade to a new "Not SegWit" client.  This is basically a hardfork.  We have already tested the game theory/incentives out here, this is kind of like miners doing a blocksize increase without community support, and miners seem not to want to do that.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:52:02

No idea what this means or how you calculate some kind of ratio from one figure!!


Nope, not at all.  We can get to 2MB is a few months.  Of course there could be a long tail of old UTXOs lasting hundreds of years, but from a capacity standpoint that would be insignificant


Well it depends.  Replay protection and therefore 100% wallet upgrades are necessary for any save hardfork idea


Yes and what do you use your keys with, a wallet that is also a verifying node. What is the point of a node if you don't verify for your local wallet?  Do you think I run my node/wallet for fun?


Because those old format transactions can quickly becomes insignificant in terms of volume


SegWit makes a hardfork more likely and safer


No, a future blocksize increase could only apply to SegWit transactions.  Why increase the blockspace for old buggy transactions?

We have BIP9, which does not orphan old style blocks.  Therefore I do not support unnecessarily dangerous softforks like BIP91 or BIP148.  If possible we should make upgrading voluntary for miners, whether we have a mining threshold or not.

In my view this is a potentially irresponsible policy, basically choosing option 6 or 7 below.  In my view, allowing trading but suspending deposits and withdrawals is not responsible.  How can people trade if they do not know what they are buying and selling?
**Policy decisions for exchanges and custodians**
Below are outlined the main policy choices exchanges could consider implementing, in the event of a contentious hardfork or chainsplit:
**1. Allow trading, deposits and withdrawals of both coins, with a “neutral” naming policy. For example Bitcoin 1 (BTC-1) &amp; Bitcoin 2 (BTC-2). Clear the order book when the hardfork occurs**
This policy may be the most “neutral” between the two coins, although it may be a bit confusing, with no coin called Bitcoin.
However, some exchanges who offer Bitcoin futures contracts or use Bitcoin as collateral for lending may not have this choice. Since they may be required to pick one coin for the loans to be denominated in.
**2. Allow trading, deposits and withdrawals of both coins. Decide to call one coin Bitcoin (BTC) and choose an alternative name for the other coin (The coin designated as “Bitcoin” will retain the order book and continue to act as the currency for any debt instruments and futures contracts)**
This could be a reasonably responsible policy.
If the new hardfork coin is designated as “Bitcoin”, there could be negative legal consequences for the exchange, if the debt instruments are re-denominated in a new coin/new software client with different rules.
**3. Allow trading on only the smaller block/original rules coin, because the hardfork coin doesn’t include strong 2 way replay protection, but still allow deposits and withdrawals for the new larger block coin**
Perhaps the smartest move for the exchanges would be to release public statements stating they will follow this policy beforehand. This is likely to encourage the hardfork proponents to go away and then come back in a few months time with a revised hardfork proposal, this time with strong 2 way replay protection. This would make life for exchanges far easier and solve many of the problems mentioned in this article.
In-fact, many exchanges have already done exactly this:


I would advise these same exchanges to clearly reaffirm this message.
**4. Allow trading on only the larger block/hardfork coin, but continue to allow deposits and withdrawals of the smaller block/original rules coin**
This is potentially similar to option 2, except trading of the smaller block/original rules chain is not enabled. One significant disadvantage of this policy, is less potential earnings for the exchange compared to following option 2.
There may be legal issues associated with converting the orders and debt to a new token or new client, without the permission of the customers.
**5. Allow trading on only one coin, while not allowing deposits and withdrawals of the other coin**
One issue with this policy is that customers may not have access to their funds. The exchange may have a legal and ethical obligation to at least allow withdrawals on both coins. The exchange may want to discourage deposits on both chains, but they could have little choice, a customer may accidentally deposit anyway, perhaps due to inadvertent replay and then the exchange will have an obligation to protect these funds.
Therefore supporting deposits and withdrawals for both coins may be a necessity for exchanges and this may not be a responsible policy. As mentioned above, replay attack protection is also a must, since malicious users are probably waiting to profit from this situation on this occasion.
**6. Suspend all withdrawals and deposits, until the “dust settles”, but allow trading of one (or perhaps even two) of the coin(s)**
This policy could be considered grossly irresponsible or perhaps negligent on the part of the exchange, especially for unstable assets such as a new coin. This would allow customers to continue trading an asset without it being clear what the asset represents. This could encourage market manipulation and there could be significant liquidity issues.
**7. Shut down the exchange, suspending all trading, deposits and withdrawals until the “dust settles”**
This may be an easy option for an exchange to take, however the risk for the exchange is they could lose potential earnings or lose market share.
Another problem is that the dust may not settle, or at least if the market situation does somehow resolve itself, the exchanges following this policy certainly didn‘t help contribute to that resolution.

Firstly it doesn't matter whether they are "genuine" transactions or not.  There may well be genuine demand, but a miner with 30% of the hash rate may just include too many transactions in blocks, even when the fees are low, as there will be limited downside for the miner since the orphan risk is too low.  The miner can make the blocks as large as they like without negative consequences and would actually benefit if some other miners took longer to receive it.
Secondly, to arbitrarily increase the block size, you could just send your own coins to yourself and it would not be expensive.  0.1 BTC is plenty to generate loads of transaction data, I don't see why this would be expensive.

You keep mentioning 100% upgrades.  Even if just one lone user upgrades, just one user, that user gets an 80% capacity increase for themselves even if nobody else upgrades

You are clearly lying here.  Segwit is not disruptive.  That is the point.  Non upgraded and upgraded wallets can seamlessly transact and at the same time upgraded wallets benefit from more capacity.  This is why Segwit was chosen.


Right.  Don't assume everyone upgrades for a hardfork then

@_date: 2015-10-27 10:36:35
In my view this is a devastating vulnerability.  Please let me know if you considered this risk in your analysis?
Let’s calculate the following:
 * Assume we have orphan risk costs which are 20% of mining revenue (excluding the impact of propagating to yourself)
 * Assume we have one 10% miner and 90 1% miners
 * The orphan risk cost to the 1% miner is 99% * 20% = 19.8% of revenue.  The orphan risk cost to the 90% miner is 90% * 20% = 18% or revenue. 
 * This is a 1.8% difference as a proportion of revenue.  In a low margin industry this is potentially very large and will cause centralisation.
 
If orphan risk costs are used in the way you suggest, it could reach a level far higher than 20%.  I believe this will be catastrophic to the network.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:55:11
What costs? Paying who? The fee could be zero and the miner could include the transactions to increase the block size and help with a selfish mining type of strategy

What else did I say!!  FFS!!
If people want more capacity they will upgrade to SegWit.  If they dont they wont.  Either Way SegWit is strictly faster than a simple hardfork to 2Mb for any given level of adoption.


No, I have absoltely no idea what you mean


That doe snot solve the problem.  But if implementations have solved it like you say, why mention this?
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:34:30


Those changes do not change anything about using the bit1 flag, which is already used.  The changes enforce the bit 1 flag.  (I disagree with this unnecessary new rule)
Actually come to think of it, of course BTC1 software signals bit1.  This is because BTC1 does include BIP141 and does enforce SegWit if activated.  Therefore had it not included the bit 1 flag LukeJr and Peter Todd would be whining about it, saying its misleading.  After-all a client should flag the rules it enforces right?  
They have already complained about the misleading BTC1 release notes which claim the "hardfork" is activated by bit4, when BTC1 does the hardfork even WITHOUT bit 4 being used at all.
Don't trust what the BTC1 devs say, they don't seem to understand how their own hardfork works.
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:16:37


Firstly, it is important to point out that SegWit is a larger capacity increase than a "simple hardfork to 2MB", for ANY given level of wallet adoption.
* If 10% of wallets upgrade, SegWit is a larger capacity increase
* If 40% of wallets upgrade, SegWit is a larger capacity increase
* If 100% of wallets upgrade, SegWit is a larger capacity increase
To get more capacity people need to upgrade, the same is true for any increase proposal.  The unique thing about Segwit is that users benefit from more capacity BEFORE waiting for others to upgrade.  In addition to this upgraded and non upgraded wallets can seamlessly transact 


In reality upgrading will be skewed towards those that do more volume, therefore the upgrade may be very fast.
However, the 2.1MB is a new limit, if people want more capacity they will upgrade.  If people prefer lower capacity (because for example fees are insignificantly small like Litecoin), then fewer people may upgrade.  But the LIMIT is still 2.1MB.


This is a misleading comment.  Those that care about the increase, can upgrade their wallets and get an 80% capacity increase immediately, without worrying about if anyone else upgrades.
80% is already 73% of the increase to 110%, which is the bulk of the increase.  Saying it will be nowhere near 110% is disingenuous.
Personally I want more capacity and lower fees.  I will upgrade and get 80% more capacity for myself.  I couldn't really care about the extra improvement to 110% others may get.
Also an 80% increase assumes no P2SH or multisig usage, which would make the increase even larger.
(Although if everyone else upgrades that may impact fee market conditions and lower prices, however the 80% increase assumes flat prices and is good enough for me)

Please let me explain why relying on orphan risk to ensure miners make smaller blocks may not be a good idea. Remember an orphaned block can contain a conflicting transaction, which is a double spend, exactly what Bitcoin was created to prevent. Please let me outline the four main reasons below:
* The orphan risk idea implies better connected miners are more profitable and therefore this may increase centralization. 
* Some have argued (Gregory Maxwell^1) that if the only significant marginal costs of including a transaction is the orphan risk, then equilibrium difficulty will be too low. The reason is because average transaction fees will be equal to the marginal orphan risk increase and therefore there is no additional revenue to subsidies the cost of hashing. Therefore the equilibrium difficulty will be too low and we have a problem. I am only partially convinced by this, because the marginal cost of orphan risk will be unique to each miner, therefore one could draw an industry marginal orphan risk cost curve and some miners would make more profits than others, this dynamic could be sufficient to ensure high enough equilibrium difficulty.
* Gavin and others have argued that computer science has come a long way in the last 20 years. For example bandwidth speeds and increased and storage costs have come down. This is often cited as a reason supporting BIP101, because transferring 8GB is expected to be much cheaper in 20 years time. I broadly agree with this line of thought. However, ironically this makes me more concerned about larger blocks, because these technological improvements may mean the marginal cost of orphan risk, when including an additional transaction into a block, will get closer to zero over time or at least become insignificant. Therefore fees will also become insignificant.
* The amount of orphan level should be minimized and not stressed. Operating this way may imply the orphan risk will constantly be pushed to the limit, to drive up mining margins. This is not good for the health of the network and reduces the ability of the network to effectively and decisively come to consensus about the state of the blockchain.
1 - The fact that verifying and transmitting transactions has a cost isn't enough, because all the funds go to pay that cost and none to the POW "artificial" cost. - 
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:45:53


Well it is certainly inevitable.  For a low enough price, demand for a useful service is essentially unbounded.  For example if transaction fees are low enough why not store my music file collection on the blockchain?  All it takes is one person to do that and blocks are essentially full.  The non full block narrative is technically nonsense.


A hardfork can steal funds.  It hardfork succeeds with minority opposition.  Then a harfork to steal my funds could also succeed.  (Actually BU people talk about doing exactly this).


That is not respect...


But there has not been a successful contentious hardfork.  If there is, I leave.  If not, Bitcoin works for me.


I am not doing that.  People can run what they like.  I want BU to happen.  I want them to have their chain.  The reason they do not do that is because they think they will lose and have a lower market cap.  What are you saying, that I should be forced to invest in their coin and my refusal to do so is stopping their freedom?  I do not want to invest in SegWit2x coin or BU coin and I will not do so, that is my freedom.  That is not restricting the freedom of anyone.


I am not.  You asked who.


It is literally 2MB of data per block.
Stop spreading false information such as SegWit is "more efficient".  The only way SegWit increases capacity is increasing the amount of data per block.
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:28:00
How is Segwit2x a compromise?  I want one thing, a safe hardfork to increase the blocksize patiently with well tested code.  Segwit2x is just as  rushed and untested as XT, Classic, BU....
Although the protocol seems far more reasonable than BU, why should we compromise on testing and patience?
What is the advantage from compromising on safety?
Instead of compromising with the hostile  group irationaly insisting on making the hardfork as dangerous and rushed as possible, we should ignore/defeat them and work on a safe hardfork

Ok.  Thanks for clarifying.  Does release mean included in a Core release or activation on the main network?
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:01:37
Of course you are completely correct.  A database can be very flexible, for example:
 * entries in databases can be digitally signed, by authorised entities 
 * databases can contain a field which is a hash of a previous entry
 * databases can be updated in milliseconds 
 * databases can be replicated and have many redundant nodes
 * databases can be connected to by many devices 
 * databases can track changes 
 * databases can use multiple mechanisms to decide the one true dataset.  For example, hierarchy of nodes, round robin rules, time based rules, randomness based rules
Why do these "private blockchain" people think databases are so useless?
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:38:55
95% has been successfully used c5x in the past.  95% is used as a fast track mechanism, if we want to lower the threshold we can, it just means the softfork takes longer as we need to wait for users to upgrade before activation

Bitcoin is an open platform, transactions could be for anything. Someone could make a game that sends loads of one satoshi transactions around for any reason, generating a huge amount of data. Remeber the one satoshi marketing thing (or however much it was)?  Without a block size limit a miner with 30% of the hash rate could just include all of these low fee transactions without suffering any real negative consequences.

Dear Justus


Externalities are a common concept in economics, however I am aware that some on the free market/libertarian end of the spectrum don’t consider these as “valid” concepts.  Instead one could argue that externalities exist only because property rights have not been defined well. I assume this is what you mean.  For example there is no negative externality from pollution from a factory, if property rights are well defined and the factory operator pays all the rights owners impacted by the pollution a market driven compensation rate.
My personal view is that this interesting line of thought can become more relevant as technologies improve and the ability to manage property rights improves.  For example a pet cat could have a chip in it a that has a bitcoin wallet with a tiny balance in it, the wallet could open a micro payment channel with each streetlight on the street as the cat walks by and pay the streetlight to light up the street.  One could therefore make the argument that the positive externality problem, of everyone benefiting from the street light can be partially technically solved.  However there is likely to remain many areas where externalities remain “valid”.
Nevertheless I think one needs to be extremely careful when applying ideas, such that externalities are not "valid", to Bitcoin and in particular Bitcoin mining incentivisation.  Bitcoin is a new concept and potentially an economic theory game changer.  The Blockchain itself is a unique type of good, in a sense it’s a public good.  The argument that the existence of a Blockchain cannot be a positive externality, because one needs to define the property rights of the Blockchain is dangerous, in my view.  The property rights of the Blockchain cannot be defined.  Everyone is able to have access to the Blockchain and be able to participate as a full node in an equal way, without some having more “rights” than others, if this occurs, Bitcoin has failed.
A similar argument can be made about bitcoin the units.  The “property rights” to bitcoins are not defined in law and do not really exists.  Instead one has control of the bitcoins by having exclusive access to private keys, this is not a right but more of a fact.  This is a potential change in concept relative to the existing property rights framework many free market thinkers advocate.  Therefore applying theories such as there are no externalities if property rights are well defined, may not be applicable inside the Bitcoin ecosystem.

There is a Core roadmap with many technologies which will cumulatively  keep adding more and more onchain capacity:
* SegWit
* Schnorr signatures
* Aggregated signatures
* Plus more e.g. MAST
On top of this we can hardfork to increase the blocksize limit for non witness data, once we have widespread consensus across the community.
Everyone wants large and continuous capacity increases over many years.
Claiming people are against capacity increases is a misconception spread by "large blockers".  There are two real differences of opinion:
1. Disagreement over what type of consensus is necessary to hardfork.
2. Large blockers, who want a limit so big that how ever much demand there is, blocks do not fill up, so that a fee market becomes unviable (in my view this doesn't even make sense, since demand is potentially unbounded, e.g. data backup)
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:07:46
On balance, like almost everyone, I think Gavin's proposal is better than the current system and agree the 1MB limit requires an increase. I do not agree that there is nothing to worry about or that "Bitcoin Wizards" are being disingenuous. There are real advantages to increasing the block size limit, however please recognise there are also real disadvantages and genuine concerns. Especially if the limit is in the multi gigabyte range or even removed as you suggest. The concerns, some of which are valid, **some are speculative and most are outweighed by the benefits** include:
* Increasing the cost of running a full node, reducing the number of full nodes and increasing the ability to censor the network
* Potentially helping some selfish mining attacks
* Failing to ensure appropriate mining rewards in the future when the block reward is low
* Increaseing block propagation time if IBLT cannot be implemented and therefore increasing mining centralisation risks

But Bitcoin Unlimited will always work, because if the BU mechanisms do not work, then people will choose not to use the BU mechanisms.  BU is  about freedom, people choosing not to use BU is part of the freedom BU provides. Therefore not running BU is still BU.  BU can therefore never be broken.

Yes, you have to compare it to some other 2MB idea...
SW does give 2MB of capacity BY any definition..
* Literal blocksize - check
* Equivalent of a 100% capacity increase - check
What metric are you claiming SegWit is not 2MB?


My statement is true either way.  Any 50% benefit from 80% more capacity themselves. 


Ok, if you want people to use your fork, you need strong consensus!!  But "your side" refuses to do this and insists on doing it without the necessary consensus, do to pure irrationality.
But even with 100% consensus, SegWit is still FASTER, than a simple hardfork to 2MB for any given level of upgrades.  If you assume 100% for a hardfork, well assume 100% for SegWit then...


Even if your funds are stolen?  What a  stupid definition


The white paper specifically mentions a shorter chain being Bitcoin.  This is not arbitrary at all.  The existing rules prevail.


Rubbish!! The sender has no idea whether the address in question can redeem the funds via SegWit or not.  You are spreading dangerous false information.
With SegWit, non upgraded wallets can seamlessly transact with upgraded wallets.  This is exactly why this method for a blocksize limit increase was chosen, because it is very smooth.
If SegWit didnt work like that, and non upgraded wallets needed to upgrade so that upgraded wallets could benefit from more capacity, I would not be supporting SegWit.


There are new address formats being released.  THESE ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR SEGWIT.  You are lying again.  You can use EXISTING address formats for SegWit...


Nonsense.  The size is about the same, depending on what you are comparing it with


Yes SegWit is 2MB, by any definition of 2MB.  Even a stupid convoluted definition of 2MB designed by morons

Well no, that is missing the point.
Any one user who upgrades gets this 89.5% benefit for their own transactions.  You do **not** need to wait for others to upgrade.  Others upgrading just gives a "side benefit" of lowering system transaction fee levels.
If you assume actual usage data (like I mentioned), for other transaction types, like multsig, where the relative benefit of SegWit is very high, then you get to 110%.

SegWit locks in 25% miner opposition at the time of activation.  A grace  period does not change that

@_date: 2017-06-07 03:36:52


Yes, it is a big problem.  That is why I strongly support onchain capacity increases:
* SegWit the fastest way to increase the blocksize limit and reduce fees.  (The upgrade is also very smooth, old and new wallets can seamlessly transact).  Please note, as soon as SegWit activates, upgraded users benefit from 80% lower fees **immediately**, even if no other users upgrade.  This is different to a hardfork, where we need to wait for other users to upgrade before getting a higher blocksize limit
* Schnorr signatures
* A safe well planned hardfork to increase the blocksize limit even more
* MAST


Nodes do not exist yet...


No.  We must not tolerate SegWit being used as ransom/leverage like that agreement indicates.  Otherwise future blocksize increases could also be stalled or held to ransom and the integrity of the system is damaged
Also, the SegWit2x proposal WIP looks dangerous.  For example it plans to do a hardfork with a tiny c1 month grace period after the client being released.  Expecting adoption from zero to a high level in just one month, despite a contentious climate, is irresponsible.  It also seems to exclude many of the technical developments aimed at making a hardfork safe, for example Johnson Lau's safer spoonet hardfork proposal. (
The proposal is also aggressive, for example nowhere does the agreement state:


Instead the agreement looks like it is trying to impose its will on the community.  That is therefore likely to be rejected by the community.
**If the agreement participants want people to upgrade, they should be pragmatic, maybe showing respect and accepting the communities ability to make the ultimate decision to hardfork would help persuade people to upgrade.  The Bitcoin community does not want to be forced.**

Almost everyone wants higher onchain capacity, including Blockstream employees.
For example many support:
* SegWit - Doubling onchain capacity, much faster than any other idea
* Schnorr signatures - increasing onchain capacity
* A safe hardfork to increase the blocksize limit even more than SegWit
Of Course, most smart engineers strongly oppose stupidly dangerous hardfork proposals like XT,Classic, BU and SegWit2x ect ect.
Instead, lets listen to the engineers and rally behind a safe hardfork like this one:


Again, more nonsense
Recently, the Core development team has made significant actual  progress in the  area of scalability.  For example:
* Segwit, which includes linear scaling of sighash operations, malleability fixes, reducing the amount of data required by the signature generator and a large c110% **onchain** capacity increase
* Libsecp256k1, which improved signature validation speeds by c7x
* A mempool limiting option mode for nodes
* Pruned mode
* Blocks only mode for nodes
* Reducing upload traffic
* Compact blocks
* Opt in RBF - helping the sender increase the priority of transactions 
* CPFP - helping the receiver increase the priority of transactions 
* Headers first
* Script signature cache has been re-implemented
* Assumed-valid blocks
* P2P network refactoring
* Fee estimation  technology that is harder to game
* Continued work on the development of LN and payment channel technology
* Plus much much more
A hardfork is up to the community, not the developers.  The developers have proposed countless hardforks ( unfortunately some are spreading misinformation causing people to support stupid hardfork proposals instead, which is stalling progress.  Please support the engineers.

This may be the case.  However, I think we need to wake up to reality here.  There is a hostile, well funded and aggressive campaign to spread misinformation about Core and scaling.
Recently, the Core team has made significant actual  progress in the  area of scalability.  For example:
* Segwit, which includes linear scaling of sighash operations, malleability fixes, reducing the amount of data required by the signature generator and a large c110% **onchain** capacity increase
* Libsecp256k1, which improved signature validation speeds by c7x
* A mempool limiting option mode for nodes
* Pruned mode
* Blocks only mode for nodes
* Reducing upload traffic
* Compact blocks
* Opt in RBF - helping the sender increase the priority of transactions 
* CPFP - helping the receiver increase the priority of transactions 
* Headers first
* Script signature cache has been re-implemented
* Assumed-valid blocks
* P2P network refactoring
* Fee estimation  technology that is harder to game
* Continued work on the development of LN and payment channel technology
* Plus much much more
As community members we need to tackle the malicious misinformation campaign head on, and defend the developers, who have done a fantastic job defending Bitcoin and scaling it.  If the community cannot effectively do this, perhaps Bitcoin is doomed to fail.
Developers have not dismissed the opinions of those in industry.  The developers have focused on delivering safe and well tested scalability and capacity enhancements.

You can't do that unless you create a new witness block p2p messaging system, which would take perhaps 12 months to develop and test. 
Such a plan would be pointless anyway, if miners want segwit, they activate it,  if not, they don't. 
Miners can't force a hardfork whatever bit they use.

It was made very clear at the meeting that this was not about an official Core release.
It was also made clear that the developers would be unable to persuade people to run their code in a hostile environment.  Therefore the purpose of the meeting was to ensure a calm environment without miners supporting or pushing for dangerous hardforks, that would then be a good climate for safe hardforks.  Miners clearly breached that, making a safe hardfork too difficult.  There is nothing anyone who was present at the meeting can do about that

Stop spreading lies:
1. The HK agreement said the hardfork would only occur with "broad support across the entire community."  Which part of that do you not understand?  Nobody can force people to upgrade and Bitcoiners do not like being told what to do, if the HK agreement tried to force a hardfork it would backfire.
2. The miners breached the agreement, by continuing and accelerating an aggressive campaign to do a ridiculously stupid, almost laughably stupid hardfork without consensus
3. The developers DID honour their end of the agreement and code up countless hardfork proposals.  See:
* BIP-MMHF, draft patch last updated 2016/7/17, discussion, Luke-Jr, 2016/2/7
* BIP-MSMMHHF, ML discussion, James Hilliard, 2016/2/23

However, despite all the great progress the developers did in making a hardfork safe and coding it up, they cannot force people to run it.  **Perhaps once all these stupid hardfork proposals stop causing such a large distraction, people will start running these safe hardfork clients.**

Why not add replay protection for the hardfork then.  That is what exchanges asked for.
The [NY Scaling agreement] ( proposal for SegWit2x hardfork client does not include 2 way replay protetction.  The development team for SegWit2x recently refused to add this vital safety feature to the hardfork.  Stating that it is too [challenging] (  
This makes the hardfork unnecessarily dangerous, since important research has already been conducted into replay protection.  For example Johnson Lau’s safe [Spoonnet] ( hardfork blocksize limit increase proposal already includes 2 way replay protection.
Many exchanges and businesses in the ecosystem have already demanded that a hardfork contain some basic safety features, and specifically asked for replay protection (see below).  I kindly ask that the exchanges continue to insist on the inclusion of this basic and vital safety feature before supporting trading of the SegWit2x hardfork coin on their platforms.

Well f2pool mined using bitcoin classic just a few days after the agreement (
Then Jihan launched an aggressive campaign to do a very dangerous and very poorly thought out hardfork without consensus (called BU).  This ruined the prospect of a calm collaborative environment necessary for a safe hardfork with consensus  and was a total violation of the agreement, both in principle but more importantly completely against the spirit of the agreement.
However, just because miners breached their side of the agreement, so what? We should do what is best for bitcoin regardless...  I would never advocate being so petty as to care about the terms of the agreement such that we damage Bitcoin. 
That is why the devs released these safe hardfork proposals.  I strongly support spoonnet as a safe hardfork, to increase the blocksize limit even more than segwit.
Spoonnet has wipe out protection, strong 2 way replay protection, change in header format, long grace period etc etc... why don't we just get behind that rather than another technically inferior proposal? 
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:40:28


Which is what exactly?  One block over 1MB mined by a miner flagging BU?  So did this happen in March when Bitcoin.com mined a block over 1MB that was orphaned?  There is no good way to define it, other than if there is a BU client, which is on a different chain
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:23:31
Err.  I don't like either 
I think bip148 is probably more responsible on balance, since it's only a softfork with the asymmetric advantage and if 51% of miners adopt it a chainsplit is avoided 
I  don't like bip148 though

sorry.  I still do not understand what you are saying.
Yes, you interpret "segwit2x" to not signal bit 1 until activation of bit91, I get that bit. 
I was making a specific point about the btc1 software client.  that client does signal bit1 before bip91 activates? 
Do you understand now:
* Whatever you mean by segwit2x, no bit 1 flag before bip91 activation 
* Software made by compiling the btc1 repository, does add a bit 1 flag before bip91 activation 
do you get it now ?

I would like to point out that **ALL meaningful transactions have a signature/witness**.  Typically the signature accounts for c65% of the data in each transaction

As I explained, it can't be done without reflecting reality.  Otherwise coins cannot be delivered to parties to the futures contract 
And if you did have a USD cash settled contract on whether BU happens or not, how exactly would that help seeing how valuable BU coins are?  (Please note, this contract cannot have BTC as collateral either, which means BitMex cannot offer this)
If the market said there was a 1% probability of BU happening, and BU  futures  contacts for BU tokens are trading at $100, then what?  Would you say the market was pricing  BU coins at $10,000 (100*100), which means it's a winner?  I would say that is stupid. 
Please think the logic through.  These futures contacts only mean something useful if the underlying token can be delivered on expiry, therefore the contract must reflect reality.    Bitfinex had limited choice in how they structured those contracts

A soft fork could reject bip148 blocks 
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:06:11


No, and it cannot do that anyway.  Yet if it did, that would not be malicious.  I can chose what I follow...  I do not want to follow the Barry agreement hardfork
But if SegWit could activate on bit 4, which it cannot, then SegWit would activate on bit 4 and wallets could upgrade to enforce the rules.


No it isnt.  But thinking that is reasonable does not help anyone.




No it is not.  Let me explain:
* Due to the contention and arguments in the community, Bitcoin Core and the community are very keen to make sure the upgrade to larger blocks is as safe and smooth as possible.
* Therefore SegWit was chosen as a method to increase the blocksize limit, that way 2 coins would be avoided, while at the same time and ALL upgraded and ALL non upgraded wallets can seamlessly transact.  This is very important in a contentious environment, when many users have no idea what is going on, and all kinds of old wallets are used.  This is unique for SegWit compared to a hardfork proposal and even Extension blocks.  It is the smoothest and safest blocksize increase idea ever proposed, therefore the technical community supported it.
* In order to do this, a new p2p layer was needed, an updated one to send around larger blocks and the original p2p layer for the small block version for old wallets would see, until they upgraded.  (By now c82% of wallets have already upgraded)
* To make this transition to the new p2p network as smooth as possible, it was rolled out before SegWit activated.  Code for it was in Core 0.13 and then it was used in Core 0.13.2
* This means 82% of the network already use the upgraded p2p network, for SegWit.  The old transport network is not used much anymore
* Currently the network will ban segregated witness data on the p2p network, as a spam defense.  Segregated Witness data will only be allowed if SegWit activates via bit 1
* Therefore, to get around this, if the Barry agreement wants to activate a variant of SegWit on a different bit, a third p2p transport network needs to be created for these blocks.  However, this will be very complicated, since the most logical way of doing this wont work, as there already is a transport network set up and used for SegWit.  The data network needs to be rolled out beforehand, a huge unnecessary complication.
Therefore the Barry Agreement is almost impossible.


Sure, it can have a new BIP and new bit, but it must also use bit 1

There is no possibility of 100%, that is my point.  That is exactly what the **rolling** voting in Bitcoin Classic did. It locked in 25% miner opposition at the time the hardfork "locks in"

@_date: 2017-06-20 14:18:43

@_date: 2017-06-05 13:42:46
I think its a tactic on their part.  From there point of view a big "risk" is that signatories defect/backtrack after SegWit activates.  This way SegWit activates at the same time the hardfork activates, from their point of view, removing the risk.
From my point of view, it does the following:
* Makes the hardfork more dangerous, as its even more rushed
* Gives a very short window for people to upgrade after SegWit activates, ironically making the "defection risk" potentially even worse from their point of view
But there plan is clearly only activate segwit if it "looks like" the hardfork will work.  This way, the period will be too short to change what it "looks like"
Also, in my view the more "opportunity" they give for defection, the less likely defection is.  People do not like being forced.

Are you being serious?  **c40% of the miners were mining with BU** (or at least claiming they were).  This put the ecosystem in crisis mode, the community had to come together warn  of the dangers of BU.  That was a total and massive breach of the agreement.  To claim otherwise is ridiculous.


What do you want me to do?  I have spent thousands of hours of my time explaining how bad BU was and encouraging miners not to run it, in an attempt to resolve the issues.  40% of the hashrate is still running BU now.  Please let me know where you want me to go to "resolve" the issues by meeting miners.  Then I can try again to explain the massive flaws in BU
1. no wipe out protection 
2. no replay protection 
3. the median EB attack
4. the ironic variant of the median EB attack 
5. DoS flaws in XThin
6. Collision flaws in XThin
7. Why AD is a flawed system, with users jumping chains
8. Why EB has problems for exchanges 
9. Why light wallets have AD = 0, and the problems that causes
ect etc ect
I have done just as much to try and point out the devastating flaws in BU, and promote safe hardforks like spoonnet as anyone else.


People are angry.  I am sorry you feel that way.  Bitcoin means a lot to people.
I oppose BIP148 as I think it's too rushed.  I still oppose a PoW change and think we should give the mining industry more time to increase onchain capacity in a safe way.  However many in the community are losing patience, fees are increasing and we need more onchain capacity as soon as possible.  However instead of using safe ways like segwit, which users have already upgraded to, some miners keep pushing untested dangerous ideas that users have not upgraded to.  Do you see why some users are angry at some miners now?
      
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:22:03
Why don't they include reply protection in the hardfork then?
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:38:33

Why not at least allow the possibility of more than 75% miner support at the time the hardfork locks in?
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:28:05


That is why we can keep the 1MB limit for these old buggy signatures


False, as you can just have more transactions 


What does this have to do with bip32?


No.  You could only support SegWit.  That way the hardware wallet does not need to store the transaction inputs or hash them, therefore it requires far less memory and processing power


No.  It makes adding new signatures far easier


First point I agree with 
 
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:38:20
SegWit has a a new blocksize limit, which is as follows:
     4 * Non witness data + witness data &lt; 4MB
This is a new block and new data structure.  The signature/witness data is stored with the non witness data, side by side.
There is another format, a serialized block, that excludes the witness data and includes the transaction inputs, outputs and values.  Only old non upgraded (before Core 0.13) clients see these blocks.  New clients do not need to worry about this old format and it causes no issues.  Please note Core 0.13 is from **before** SegWIt activation logic was included.  Almost c95% of the network has already upgraded, so **almost nobody will see these smaller 1MB blocks.**
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:03:51
You say Segwit changes how it's measured, which is fine.  But even if you use the bytes method (not the new weight measure), Segwit still increases the number of bytes per block.
In the future Schorr signatures could be s softfork to further increase the effective blocksize (capacity).  However unlike Segwit this may not literally increases the size of blocks in bytes.
Whatever you think of future increase, please accept the basic fact that Segwit literally increases the size of blocks in bytes 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:06:33
Many reasons  
1. witness data can more easily be pruned
2. witness data doesn't impact the UTXO
3. witness data is the bulk of the data (c65%)

SegWit is a blocksize limit increase to 2MB.  The difference is its a faster increase than a hardfork, since users get the benefit of more capacity before others upgrade and that it is a much smoother upgrade, since upgraded and non upgraded wallets can seamlessly transact.
The HK agreement said:


Which part of that did you not understand?
The miners said they would only run Core compatible systems, yet just two weeks after the agreement one of the large pools who signed ran Bitcoin Classic and mined a block.  Then an aggressive campaign to hardfork without consensus occurred (BU), which effectively blocked the broad support for a HF.
The agreement said:


Perhaps you interpeted this to mean:


Had the agreement meant something as ridiculous as that, then many would reject it.  The idea was that the community WANTS Segwit.  I do not want anybody to run SegWit BECAUSE of some agreement, despite thinking it was a bad idea.  That would be ridiculous and damage the integrity of Bitcoin.


How are we far apart?  Both sides want more capacity.  What is the difference?  The only difference I seem to spot is once side insists on making upgrades as dangerous as possible, despite well known safer ways of upgrading, and one side wants to ensure upgrades are reasonably safe.  Do you really want to cause a split because of that?
 
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:05:21

The comments made about 2 conflicting fee markets are nonsense.
Old wallets without SegWit can use the old per byte fee metric, it doesn't conflict with SegWit, miners just want to maximise revenue per block.
However Jeff seems to assume everyone will upgrade anyway, since its also a hardfork

if you make the same wallet upgrade assumption, then it is also immediate.
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:36:44
The reason SegWit was chosen is because it's a win win solution.  There are not many disadvantages.  The main disadvantage is it increases the blocksize limit, and this has many problems like slower block propagation and longer verification times
Of course there are many fake disadvantages:
* SegWit uses anyone can spend kludge
* Segwit is not a real blocksize limit increase (it is)
* SegWit requires users to upgrade to validate new rules (true of any proposal)
* SegWit introduces technical debt (when the reality is it removes technical debt)
* The people who wrote it are liars (If true, so what?)
* Segwit fixes transaction malleability, which is a feature not a bug
* Segwit makes a future blocksize increase hardfork more difficult (the reverse is true)
* SegWit allows 4MB of spam and only 2MB of capacity (this is misleading, 4MB is also available for capacity as well as spam, just like the existing 1MB, except the 4MB will be less damaging)
If SegWit had real significant disadvantages, then why spread this fake nonsense?
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:36:25

@_date: 2017-06-01 01:20:12


I agree.  Maybe even more.  Maybe 95% of use cases.
But building a distributed censorship resistant system, better than higher throughput and cheaper centralized alternatives 5% of the time, is pretty cool.
If that 5% can be replicated across the centralized financial system, Bitcoin may be pretty valuable one day.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:19:54


Let's compare Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Classic for example.  A 1.1MB block would be considered valid by Classic but invalid by Core.  In contrast all Core blocks are considered valid by Classic. 
This means that if Classic is the most work chain, there are two coins.  In contrast, if Core is the most work chain, there is only one chain, Core.  Therefore Core has the ability to wipe out the Classic chain 
Now let's think through the financial markets implications of this.  Investors should prefer to hold the safer coin that cannot be wiped out.  Speculators are likely to want to invest in the safer coin, drive up the price and then cause the wipeout, and make profits.
This gives Core what I call the asymmetric advantage.  This is why the community rejected Classic, people do not want to back a losing side.


In my view 10% hashpower and 30% economic support is sufficient 
 
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:38:11
Why is wipeout or replay protection not relevant if 95% of miners upgrade?

Well if you are a regular user, once you upgrade, then **all your new outputs** will be redeemable by segregation of the witness
If you dont use Bitcoin much, then it doesnt matter anyway

I am saying, it is not Bitfinex's fault for making the BU contract "unfair".  Bitfinex had to follow reality to ensure the contract results in something which can be delivered
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:20:01


Yes.  Jeff initially confused me with his "two limits" and "two fee markets" criticism  of SegWit.  However after a few weeks I read up further and finally realised SegWit has one new larger limit.
It is amazing Jeff is now implementing some kind of SegWit variant, if he still has this misunderstanding

If BU had a flag say and checkpoint, the coin would exist  and a futures contract could be written


Then what is the incentive to buy "Core coins", if they also expire worthless if the event doesnt happen.  An "if" condition in a futures contract is hard
Just think it through, it does not work 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:49:35


Well people are not forced to run code, but the policy and statements from the aggressors indicate they are trying to force people:
1. Statements indicating the legacy chain will not survive
2. Statements indicating [attacks]( will be done on the legacy chain, such as orphaning
3. Hardforks without replay protection, due the assumption the old chain will not survive and thus people are forced to upgrade
4. No hardfork bit, forcing the change on some users with light clients, such that they do not need to upgrade to opt-in to the hardfork
5. Asking exchange and businesses to label the new coin Bitcoin, without first seeking strong consensus from users
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:19:20


Well, a deluded BU backer might be ok with this.
However, maybe there are more moderate BU backers, who would rather the timing and nature of the launch of BU wasn't done tactically by Core supporters, to ensure the maximum chance of failure
Anyway, defining such a launch is very difficult.  And I do not see why Core supporters would want to have counterparty exposure to Bitfinex, when the fork may not happen and they make no money.

Its basically come down to this:
* Jihan wants to use SegWit as leverage to make sure there is a HF, without letting the community decide.  Jihan is willing to make the HF much less likely and less safe, to ensure there is no risk of SegWit without a HF
* The community may only want a HF if its allowed to decide and if its safe
This then allows Jihan to misrepresent others as not wanting a HF at all

Who said 100% benefit in 24 hours?
You only get an instant benefit if you assume the same adoption as an instant benefit hardfork!!!

A 3rd p2p network is not feasible to implement, the pull request has already been merged...
As I explained this does not make it any easier for people "planning to scrap the hardfork".  Believe me, I am potentially one of those people, if there was an angle  to help to scrap the hardfork by using bit1, I would see it.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:18:06
The way this code is constructed, I think it is as follows:
* The hardfork can only happen if SegWit activates
* The hardfork can only happen after 15th September
* If its after 15th September and SegWit is active, then the HF is active
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:48:05
Yes.  Maybe people receive and spend everyday
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:42:31


When did I do that?  My point is with the asymmetric advantage, minority economic support is sufficient to win


Once again you have totally ignored the asymmetric advantage 


Yes that is another positive advantage for the minority hashrate chain some people mention.  I don't think this will prove that much of an advantage, and who knows, these high fee transactions could be replayed on the majority hashrate chain, which could cancel out some of the advantage.
But whatever  happens with fees, in my view, the ability for financial speculators to wipeout another chain, is too compelling    
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:20:37
You are refusing to respond to a simple question.  Why not have a voting window, so that BETWEEN 75% and 100% support is possible?  What is the disadvantage of doing that?
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:07:11


Default option for who?  Users run whatever client they want?
Changing the bit activation for SegWit does not make it any less default


That may be needed as a security measure if SegWit2x is done very badly.


And changing the bit doesnt make that true...
Also BIP91 already exists
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:36:23


It doesnt really.  **SegWit is both an increase to 2MB blocks AND has most of the centralization disadvantages of a simple hardfork to 2MB.**  The community asked for a blocksize increase, so the Core team delivered, despite the disadvantageous of larger blocks


That does not solve it....  Why not actually solve the problem?


Yes they can.  They just cant benefit directly by sending SeWit transactions


Right, you need to upgrade to an LN client to do LN channels.


What?  Stop comparing LN and Segwit, they are different things you are confusing....
SegWit is an onchain blocksize limit increase, it has many of the scaling disadvantages as any other blocksize limit increase
LN is a payment channel system, that is totally different to SegWit
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:48:12


I kindly ask that you please join the exchanges in asking the SegWit2x client to include strong 2 way replay protection, before supporting the hardfork.  As of now, the SegWit2x team refuses to include any replay protection, stating "it is too challenging'.  However Johnson Lau's spoonnet 3 already contains code for this.  Why do people insists on making the hardfork dangerous?  Lets not compromise on safety when we don't have to.  Please support Johnson Lau's safe Spoonnet hardfork instead of the dangerous and rushed SegWit2x

If everyone thought and acted the same way, as "larger blockers", then yes I agree, the conclusions in my post are false. The Bitcoin Classic upgrade would have been very smooth and the concerns I raised would not have materialized.
However, I think it is very important to appreciate that different people think and act differently. The real world is made up of many different types of people, who have different perspectives. Therefore, when deciding on the most robust upgrade methodology, it is important to evaluate not just how you would act, but also how those who may think differently than you will act. Part of being able to effectively do this, is being able to listen to and collaborate with others, especially those who think differently.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:51:49


Finally 




Indeed.  Bitcoin is not perfect.  We should try to mitigate problems, not pretend  they don't exist 
 
But there are some advantages of this characteristic, for example it ensures a hardfork requires strong consensus across the community, which protects the 21 million cap  
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:31:43


Nakamoto consensus, or most work chain rules, is a methodology for determining the order of transactions, to solve the double spending problem. It is unrealistic to claim this solves other problems in society like political problems.
Obviously some people intend to follow the most work **valid** chain and others intend to define **validity** by most work.  Intentions are important and determine how people may behave.  It is important to recognize that different people think differently and therefore may behave differently.  Just because you will act one way, please be open minded and recognise that others may act a different way.  Then let's work collobaratively together to build a safe hardfork, which will work even of others behave differently to how you would behave.
Does that seem fair?
But the above is a bit philosophical.  Pragmatically speaking, whatever people intend to do, there is no actual client that follows the longest chain without checking any rules.  Perhaps building one would be an interesting experiment...
 You mentioned a lack of follow up attempts to resolve the issues.  I ask again, what would you like me to do?
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:23:19


Exactly.  That is how the bet was structured.  But you were complaining saying that was unfair.


Yes.  The only logical way it works is the way Bitfinex structured it.






Are you assuming BU has wipeout protection now?
How does one make money from these terms:
* If you back BU, the only way to profit is the value of Core going up
* If you back Core, the only way to profit is the value of BU going up
That is stupid, in my view.


No it didnt.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:49:16
My comment does not imply a lack of understanding of "lock in".  Lock in could mean, don't upgrade and these other clients will be forced away.
I also note how you refuse to respond to my question.
Why not at least allow the possibility of over 75%?   What is the disadvantage of it?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:44:28
At the time the hardfork "locks in", 25% of miners have not upgraded.
Then there is a short 4 week grace period 
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:12:31
with a long enough grace period, I think so
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:20:29

I suspect most transactions are initiated from large businesses and exchanges.
But a light client is no harder to upgrade than a full node, actually it's easier

No.  Experts decide, after considering many technical factors passengers do not understand
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:32:49
Jihan basically said that if  some some people run bip148 and others run a client supporting the existing rules, such that there is a chainsplit,  Jihan will secretly mine a third incompatible hardfork chain and not publish those blocks.  
Why on earth would anyone run the hardfork client that cannot even see the third secret chain?
This is the dumbest idea I have seen.  It makes BU look smart in comparison.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:22:17
Also the SegWit2x client does not have 2 way replay protection 
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:14:50


A full memepool is necessary for a variety of reasons:
* Ensuring there are incentives for miners to move the chain forward and not just re do the previous block, when the block reward is low
* Ensuring there is a fee market, such that users need to outbid each other to get space in the blockchain.
* Also there are technical constants, such that the need to ensure ordinary users can verify the transaction data, which means blocks need to be small enough for ordinary users to verify
Luckily the Core team has done a huge amount of work improving scalability recently:
* Segwit, which includes linear scaling of sighash operations, malleability fixes, reducing the amount of data required by the signature generator and a large c110% **onchain** capacity increase.  (this is a faster capacity increase than a simple hardfork to 2MB)
* Libsecp256k1, which improved signature validation speeds by c7x
* A mempool limiting option mode for nodes
* Pruned mode
* Blocks only mode for nodes
* Reducing upload traffic
* Compact blocks
* Opt in RBF - helping the sender increase the priority of transactions 
* CPFP - helping the receiver increase the priority of transactions 
* Headers first
* Script signature cache has been re-implemented
* Assumed-valid blocks
* P2P network refactoring
* Fee estimation  technology that is harder to game
* Continued work on the development of LN and payment channel technology
* Plus much much more
A hardfork is up to the community, not the developers.  The developers have proposed countless hardforks ( unfortunately some are spreading misinformation causing people to support stupid hardfork proposals instead, which is stalling progress.  Please support the engineers and safe hardforks like Spoonnet
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:11:55
Yes.  They flag bit 1....
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:28:36


Right, ok, so if you assume 100%, then SegWit is a larger blockszie limit increase than a hardfork
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:09:20


Please stop ignoring all the financial and economic implications of an asymmetric split.  Dont you get it?  Investors and speculators will want to back the side with the asymmetric advantage and make profits 


No!  That is a a totally different type of chainsplit, not an asymmetric one not a symetric one.  That is when both chains are considered valid by all nodes.  That is not a hardfork.  For this split to continue there needs to be some kind of p2p network partioning or some incredibly unlikely event (blocks being discovered at the same time), needs to keep repeating.  Therefore this chainsplit is likely to be over soon.
This is so frustrating.  I must have explained this over 2,000 times over 2 years
      
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:06:09
I don't think that is how bip91 works.
If it did, that would not fix the issue, but it doesn't anyway 
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:20:18
I would say the ordinary user needs to ability to cheaply run a full node, otherwise bitcoin has no unique characteristics 
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:14:12


No it is not.  The current hardfork is set to occur on 15th October, if SegWit is active by then 
I suspect Jihan plans to activate SegWit as close to 15th October as possible, leaving an almost zero grace period 
   
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:54:42
No it is not.   Which part of rolling voting do you not understand?
You are simply wrong, Bitcoin Classic had rolling voting not a voting window

@_date: 2017-06-05 00:30:35
This was an inherent property of BU, rather than a fault of those writing the futures contracts.
BU was constructed as follows:
* If a mining majority support BU, it exists
* If a mining majority does not support BU, BU does not exists
A futures contact had to reflect that reality, otherwise it wouldn't follow reality and would be open to arbitrage
If exchanges were to make conditional contracts:
* If BU exists at a date Y, then the price will be X
That would be open to all kinds of manipulation and there would be no delivery mechanism for that contract.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:04:14


110% based on actual transaction data.
Upgraded users can unilaterally get an 80% increase, even if nobody else upgrades.  80% &gt; 70%.


*  a quick and smooth hardfork to larger blocks would be a faster capacity increase than a slow upgrade to SegWit
*  a quick and smooth upgrade to segwit would be a faster capacity increase than a slow upgrade via a hardfork
However, both of these are a spurious way of looking at the situation.
* a fair like for like upgrade comparison, would mean a faster onchain capacity increase for segwit


Yes.  The 80% fee reduction assumes that supply and demand conditions remain unchanged.


That is not true.  Old wallets still see all the inputs and the outputs on the blockchain


False.  A softfork can be forced by 51% of miners, unlike a hardfork


Please show me.
SegWit is opt in, which is therefore less intrusive than the alternatives


Really?  Which witness data?
    
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:51:39


You asked about bip148


Sorry.  I dont understand this 


I'm obviously referring to the hardfork element of it 


I was talking about the technical merit of bip148, not assuming what miners do.
I think it's very  unlikely bip148 happens, but if it does happen I think more than 50% miner support is very likely.  Jihan Wu controls a lot of hashrate  and he recently announced he would  not oppose bip148, but instead he would mine on a new chain, a very friendly move (perhaps in secret for some reason)


Well I think they think miners will follow the money.
As I say, I'm opposed to it
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:31:10
There is no 2MB hardfork.  SegWit2x changes the weight limit from 4MB to 8MB, that is the hardfork 
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:53:09


No, I think their idea was, have it look like segwit activate after the UASF, to kill the UASF as it makes the UASF look pointless.


I think that time would be good, but Jihan seems not to.  I also think that time would be good to build support for the hardfork
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:38:55
What if:
1. This happened but the block over 1MB was mined by a miner not flagging BU
2. What if this happened twice?
And this is just a betting contract, settled for cash (e.g. USD).  It cannot deliver coins, which is what the exchanges wanted to deliver
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:42:39
Unfortunately, I dont think it will ever be easy.  We need to keep fighting the FUD, especially to newer users and businesses 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:34:14
But if we want the hardfork to be safe  we need to put the work in to upgrade.
Otherwise light wallets will have replay problems.  To avoid these problems we need to make effort and users need to upgrade.  Let's not assume all users want to upgrade, but leave it up to them.  If we give them a free choice and ensure they have the ability to safely make a choice, they will choose the hardfork.  This is how you persuade people.  If you say everyone must upgrade, or there will be replay chaos, people will feel forced, and may be less likely to upgrade.  It's kind of a catch 22, we need replay protection to ensure there isn't a 2nd coin.
Please can you send a link to the field data?

Perhaps this paper from 1996 may be relevant (It is written by the author of Bitgold, a project which Satoshi said Bitcoin is based on):
The paper argues there is a mental accounting barrier to using microtransactions and therefore economics break down at very low levels.  I agree with the paper, we need economic meaningful transaction fees, otherwise normal markets and economics will not apply.

Bitcoin transactions take around 1 second to propagate around the network.  That is pretty fast.  This is equivalent to a credit card payment.
Then there is a "confirmation" process, which as an ordinary user, you shouldn't really need to worry about.  For a credit card payment this period is around 90 days.  For bitcoin this can be around an hour, most other crypto currencies take longer than this for the same level of security.  However maybe the shorter blocktime in Litecoin lowers **variance** of the time.
But as I said, ordinary users should not worry about it and should only be concerned with the 1 second time.
With the lighting network, we could get a high security transaction in as little time as 0.1 second

it is literally an increase in the amount of data per block 
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:41:29


Yes its is possible that nobody upgrades their wallets to support SegWit transactions.
But lets compares two scenarios:
* A simple hardfork to 2MB at block X
* SegWit activating at block Y
If we assume, that by block X, Z% of wallets have upgraded for the hardfork, why not also assume that at block Y, Z% of wallets have also upgraded for SegWit?  This is the only fair way of comparing.
For any given Z, SegWit is a faster blocksize limit increase than for a simple hardfork to 2MB
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:19:41
I am trying to explain that everyone supports higher onchain capacity.  But we must ensure upgrade proposals are robust, otherwise, quite rightly, the community will reject them
