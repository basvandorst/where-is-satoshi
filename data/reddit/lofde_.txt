Money is a tool you set its value when you jew around with people, i have 4 banana's but you have on orange and thats unqiue or special so i trade 2 of my banana's for your one orange now you have two things... same with money, same with btc, or anything like Gold, just try getting exactly SPOT price from someone at any store. Theyll laugh and try to take 20% for turning Gold into Cash. :/

a video i watched said that more money has been stolen in the name of "'God"" than any other crime ever in the history of man.. While I do believe in intelligent design, I feel wow if you built this amazing 100 sun trip life experience youve given and shown me how many people either dont care or are the evil you speak of, its mind moggling instead of curing hunger, and doing the things the world needs we have to have the newest everything, but i guess thats how economys work, but i hope trump never figures out we make money off war. If he watches war dogs or lord of war were all fucked.

plus try to leave the country with 10,000,000$ of currency held in a US bank account, or do a wire transfer ect.. btc wouldnt be where it is today without issues with banks

i could do local bitcoins and trade walmart to walmart if i have to just going to take more time 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:03:48
do you have a url 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:08
No some people, esp in the south, due to the history of the world and the 20s' colapse quit using banks all together there was a huge distrust and they switched back to what they knew. trading in gold and silver, or bartering and said fuck a bank.

I remember watching the show American Greed, there was this guy that was worth a FORTUNE, because he had a network of people, someone would get info on what AMD, intel, ect was doing and pass it along to time... they got busted bc they were using voice calls and got those recorded caught red handed, now imagine they are using PGP GPG or whatever to communicate and BTC also, it really creates a situation where you ask yourself can insider trading even be stopped at this point?  Because of crypto if they had been using it i doubt they would have been caught!  Crazy times we live in as rich chinese flood into Canada buying up land 5x-10x its value forcing those candians to sell and move on but i think they recently closed this loop hole.  Never in the history of the world has any on person been ale to carry so much cash with them, a chinese businesss man looking to go on the run and divert several million into crypto and all he needs to remember is a long passphrase to unlock his wallet, and it only takes 7 full bitcoin to = $100,000 USD. In my state if you were driving with that much cash even if it was your own in your own hands it would be taken away, and probably never returned; civil asset forfeiture (google : policing for profit tennessee) :(

What we're seeing now is just supply and demand, bitcoin is still strong because of its wide use, I am excited for monereo tho.. i feel btc is actually at its best time to buy in a long time.. 
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:37:03
I see your correlation between the two said items, which adds a smudge factor into the idea.
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:00:14
Gotcha, not good enough at math but I wonder with only 21 million distributed around 8 or so billion people what happens when just one stashio becomes more valuable than a very high usd note, ie it's not as divisible anymore... However it is a very small amount so I guess it's probably never going to be a problem
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:45:03
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:21:31
Yeah the first day your going to have to get some of that "God's trust" writing written bigger on the note with the bankers address so you can go kill him if he steals your gold
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:41:27
Would that be 3.14 stashios?

I wonder how often btc stays in Flux with multiple currencies at once, if there were big differences between say 3 you could trade around and make nice profits
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:24:14
Ahh gotcha well that's kewl then.
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:03:03
Actually when I first bought a btc it was about $50-100 usd for one Bitcoin. Don't I wish I could go back, but at the time I was just buying it when needed, using it as an exchange just figuring when I needed more I could buy more because I was still converting... The same item I bought for $50 (1btc) ended up being the same $50 even tho it was now only (0.2btc) so for me it didn't really matter. But yes I wish I could go back and load up.

Good point on converting stock into cokes and mortgage equity into coffee. As one of my mentors taught me, diversification is key.. So I feel like anyone interesting in money, politics, government, etc would be interesting in hedging risk with btc.
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:37:19
As the price of gas is 'unstable' or mortgage prices etc.
@_date: 2019-12-23 11:57:18
Good thing is as things change, like gas prices change daily you can also re-evaluate your estimate of bitcoin ultra fast which is kind of cool... Get some bad news on things cost drops 10%, things going worse drop it more. Cost and price as an economic study makes things a lot more fluid, but with normal prices things don't Flux as often. I tried to explain it to a bar owner like this, say you have 6 pack of beer for sale and they're selling fast you can raise the price so the last 2 are almost double normal cost maybe the last is a 3x premium because it's the last beer and you know if you drink that at that point it might not matter. That kind of flexibility is really resounding. Just shows you how even a 100 dollar bill is just a nice peice of paper, it hold no value at all except what you place upon it. BTW those 500 euro notes look pretty awesome wish we had a 500 $usd bill.

Imagine us looking back mad we didn't buy as many coins as we could at $7k a coin, when they hit $1m per coin. I def think it's possible. I'm just broke! =)
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:40:37
Well with a lambo currently at 66 btc it's not too far from there. My car would sell for about 5 btc, kind of feels like I should be getting more for it than 5 whole bitcoins tho! I'd have to haggle a little bit. Lol
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:58:39
I always heard that more US currency is held "overseas" and when it comes back to the US it causes "demand-pull inflation" which is good for the US.  Not sure how this would change with crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:54:25
That would be pretty cool
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:27:32
Yeah I really liked the fun antics that people were doing with doge coin.
@_date: 2019-12-23 20:03:06
Nah not in that scenario. Lol
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:44:27
Wonder how it will be with other currencies, also you have to imagine the learning curves for people. Like old people who got confused when their debit card has to be inserted now instead of swiped
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:19:29
Yeah for only 66 btc just digitz and hex on a computer somewhere I have a sweet lambo I'll sell you! Crazy that some transaction like that will actually occur and no middle men or banks or government taxes to worry about. Power to the people!
@_date: 2019-12-23 20:05:58
Reminds me of how people do here so often buying a car with cash for 5 grand asking the person to leave the value field blank and writing down like 500 bucks saying it's a fixer upper.
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:21:23
So that's about 262,500 per person with 8 billion people, not really sure how things would work out on a huge scale. Would we just add more divisions if needed. Kind of surprised 21 million was set as the high limit. Still interesting to contemplate how it could be used maybe a 100 years from now
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:26:24
If there were some major war the guy with guns and ammo and food won't probably need any more fire burning material.
