....I can't believe I didn't see that one coming. 
Obvious in retrospect. I salute your dirty, dirty mind, wickedcold.

I responded to my original post, but have realized that you aren't going to see that. So this is just to let you know I said more stuff before you responded.

Just watched your 'how to buy bitcoin' tutorial. If I understand correctly, I have to go to a bank to deposit money into your account. Will this change in the future? 
Will this be problematic as a Canadian? I mean I'm in one country, you're in another. I've never passed money across a border before. 
Best of luck with the company, I really like the idea of bitcoin and would like to be more involved but as a layman I'm still hearing stories of lost, stolen or bungled bitcoin transfers.
Educate me, okay? Thanks!

Okay, gotcha. Thanks for the reply. I'll look to Canadian sellers then. Again, thanks for the tips and best of luck with your venture.

I heard about you here, and now.
You're new to me, so I'll investigate.
Does that answer you sufficiently?

Edited to add: After a quick look at your site I can say as a Canadian your "How to buy bitcoin" tutorial isn't terrifically relevant.
I'm new to bitcoin (I got a tip account to see what the haps are) so I could use some information relevant to my situation. I realize that a new company might not have all the laws of all the countries in the world, but still.

Yeah I saw your reply to someone else after I had posted. Thanks though, I hope your friends/family appreciate your gifts and thanks for the reply!

I've been looking at Bitcoin for a while now and it looks like this is the future. Ever read 'Cryptonomicon' by Neal Stephenson? He uses virtual currency in the book and it's an excellent if somewhat confusticating introduction. Everything I've read about bitcoin and how virtual currencies work is a little confusing but Cryptonomicon lays it out in a way that makes virtual currency seem at least as stable as fiat currencies. 
P.S. I like your piece! It will enjoy its view I'm sure.

If you're wanting to give some out, I'll happily take some! I don't have any bitcoin yet (because life) but it's something I have been wanting to get into for a while. 
Anyway... happy holidays either way.
