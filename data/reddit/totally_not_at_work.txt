A good thing, but you're proposing a miner that would intentionally choose less payout. 
And of course, it could easily be forked to do just the opposite.

I'm working on scripting setting up your own node as well. My biggest barrier to running p2pool was that there are limited instructions on how to set it up (compared to the avalanche of tutorials on setting up cgminer of slush's pool.)
The basic idea is:
* Download the latest Ubuntu
* Download the bittorrent blockchain
* run a variation of [this script]( [from this thread]( (or likely, a few of them) to install the reference client, a stratum proxy, cgminer, p2pool, set up merged mining, and provide a very basic firewall for the box.
Ideally this new node could mine with usb sticks attached directly to it, or supply a connection to older getwork devices.

yubikey man, yubikey. even if they break into your safe, they'd still need your keychain -- at which point we're talking about some serious Alias level espionage

Better yet! Buy on btc-e and sell in person through localbitcoins for 30% markup!

Solo-Miners and pools can configure their bitcoin client to only accept transactions with a fee above an arbitrary amount. The larger a percentage I have in the hashrate pool, the more incentive I have to only allow higher transaction fees (considering my capital costs of hardware, electricity, etc).
I only need to worry about my profit margin if I preclude a transaction fee level that is readily accepted by a larger percentage of the hash rate pool that I represent.
There will likely always be miners who are hashing only for zero fee transactions, but those hits will be fewer and further in between, because there will always be a limit to people's charity. 
also, the difficulty can adjust downward too.

That sounds like some serious prisoner's dilemma action.

if not, one could submit the same work to all the pools, cashing in on that sweet PPS, all while withholding actual block hits for themselves.

Okay, how about this:
A non profit exchange that pays for it's existence through donations and arbitrage, providing zero fees for conversion between fiat and bitcoin in both directions.

I don't believe anyone said anything about "any" negative consequences. Just the big ones, like living in the streets dying from starvation.

you are precisely the opposite from correct in your statements.

Were I to run this non-profit, I would expect the value of bitcoin to go up because it exists. I would then hold bitcoins in my wallet as a personal investment.

Transferring bitcoin to cash takes a long time for the average user (less of a problem for large merchants).
This means there is a pool of people holding bitcoin and looking for a place to spend it as bitcoin.
Also, like all things tech, most people who hold bitcoin are single males.
If I could spend coin on, say, some sort of streaming performance, I would.

Am I right in assuming that less friction in exchanging fiat to bitcoin would serve to increase the value of bitcoin? as in, a business could make more money by holding some bitcoin as "profit" and providing 0% fee exchange?

I'm confused. Wouldn't a change like this require full adoption from the miners?
