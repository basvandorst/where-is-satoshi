If LN is really that great but why not just use USD if it’s available and avoid transaction fees that eat up a huge amount of Venezuelans pay checks. BTC price is very volatile so you could end up loosing even more money on top of transaction fees.

I’m sold

I agree. My father for instance bought at $6500 because he saw the price action and wanted in on the action. Despite this he doesn’t see crypto currencies as somthing that will stick around.

There are some interesting posts about this by people who actually live in Venezuela. From what They have explained allot of people just use usd. They use bitcoin but it’s more of a hassle to do so since they are paid in cash any way. Not only that, they aren’t exactly in any position to be saving their money as most of it is spent to keep the essentials flowing. Bitcoin isn’t really a solution to the problems Venezuela is facing.

I’m not talking about you. I’m talking about the point you brought up 
                             “Investing more than you can afford to lose”
What I was trying to articulate was that people who are prone to making poor financial decisions will do so regardless of this post. I understand the purpose and perhaps you prevented someone from investing more than they should. Despite this possibility it takes a certain type of person (a moron) to decide against putting their retirement into something as speculative and volatile as bitcoin simply because a stranger on the internet advised against it.
              
If not today than tomorrow. You can’t prevent people with poor judgment from making poor decisions forever. And why would you? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:58:36
I think you're right
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:30:48
If you dump your retirement into bitcoin at 10k then it’s clear that you didn’t deserve it in the first place. If you work your ass off your entire life or even hit it big while your young and put it all on red then you shouldn’t have so much as a frown on your face if you loose it all. If you invest any amount of money in anything and aren’t prepared to loose it all then you are a fool. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:04:23
 I’m confident it will go above 10k but I’ve invested a sensible amount of money that if I were to loose wouldn’t have a major impact on my life. All I’m saying is that you can stop stupid people from being stupid.

How would government operate without a banking system or traceable currency? How do we collect taxes effectively to afford things like public education and military spending if the vast majority of the world starts using a decentralized cryptographic currency?

Insanely easy to trigger people in this sub. Thank you for your common sense.

That’s your basis for optimism? It happened once so it’s bound to happen again. Best of luck to you my friend. I’d recommend an ice cold shower and a glass of whiskey to get your head back on straight. I guess I’ll go prepare for the next holocaust and civil war since human behavior repeats itself so consistently that you can literally bet on it.

If you don’t care about the price then you are in the minority.

Yeah I never really cared about changing the world. I just wanted to make money to buy fancy hats so people would think I’m more interesting than I actually am.

You’re exactly right. Neither are useful when applied to crypto.

No utility is a bit much but there ar more reasons not to use it than to use it.

You’re full of shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:34:46
Spot on. Didn’t even realize this simple fact until 2 months ago. If you want crypto to replace fiat currency then you must be either stupid or an anarchist. A supplementary currency to fiat at best. Its utility will never be fully unleashed on the scale many hope it will because it would end society as we know it.

I find a very healthy amount of criticism in the equity investing subs I associate myself with (excluding Robin Hood and penny stock subs) in fact it is welcomed and encouraged there. For that reason I don’t find them as deserving of my condemnation as crypto cult members.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:18:52
Why? Seems a bit dramatic on your part. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:55:26
I concur. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:12:50
Stop this technical analysis nonsense. You can not predict the future based on the past. If you aren’t using fundamentals then you are picking numbers with a blindfold on. Don’t even kid yourself with this garbage.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:24:06
I think allot of the HODL cult members are starting to sweat and are looking to do what they do best; misrepresent crypto currencies and encourages (even praises) reckless behavior as a means to convince themselves that every thing will be alright. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:10:47
That is sooooo cool! I'll be sure to give you my business next build I do. I'd love to see more vendors doing what you're doing.

I will definitely check that out. The fees really add up on Coinbase...

Bitcoin actually has little to no utility in Venezuela, ironically USD is used wayyyyy more than the bolívar or any other crypto currency for that matter. In this circumstance BTC proves to have more disadvantages than fiat USD. This technology is not a solution to the problems that country faces (capitalism is).
