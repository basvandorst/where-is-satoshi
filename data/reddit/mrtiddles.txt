The richest man in Asia's name is "Ka-Shing".
You can't make this stuff up, folks.

Ok, that's rad and now I want one. Perhaps a music studio? 
@_date: 2014-05-15 19:09:56
Yeah no joke. And they're cheaper than I expected too. I might actually have to consider this when we buy our next house lol

People selling Ferraris have weird expectations. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:23:54
Exactly! Congratulations, also, mate.

I kinda want that M3

I blame Glenn Beck.

That's weird that they would specifically call out "no bitcoin" on that Safflower oil. I wonder if they got scammed, lol

Beautiful car, but I'm just not a fan of the El Camino for some reason. Can't even explain it.
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:24:29
oh wow, lol

I uh...wish I still worked in IT at my college. For reasons.

Stefan Molyneux pointed out that governments will be more likely to accept it and less likely to regulate it if the politicians start realizing they can accept what basically amounts to anonymous donations. 
I mean, since they do it anyway through other nefarious means, why not lend some long-term viability to the system which will, as we know, could be the support system to prop up the economy when the US dollar fails.
It's not like politicians understand technology. If someone tells them they can get anonymous donations via Fartcoin they'd jump at the chance until someone gave them real money and said Fartcoin was made up "techno money" and told them to legislate it, which hopefully by then they'd have received enough money and converted it to fiat that they'd just take the lobbyist money and run.
Sidenote: I just got a new idea for an altcoin.

Makes sense. Thanks for the response.

I'm not far, next time I'm in town I'm going to swing by and buy some bits. Where can I find the ATMs?
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:20:29
I'm not questioning you, but genuinely curious: what are the main sources showing merchant sales numbers?

I think there's a fair-sized crossover between bitcoin enthusiasts and R*** Paul supporters
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:29:57
Yep, same here. Maybe this is how microtransactions can start to matter. dime
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:25:16
"Dear boss" lol
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:39:46
My buddy and I talk about this often.

Exchanges are handy for new adopters who aren't necessarily anti-government us-dollar-is-bad sensationalists like a lot of us tend to be.
It's a safe analogy to a regular bank, and it removes the responsibility of managing your own "bank", which is appealing to Joe Everybody. 
You don't have to argue the validity of holding your own private keys to me, but the real hurdle to mass adoption, in my opinion, is holding up a few pillars of the bitcoin community in the form of major exchanges that hold their heads high and don't scam folks.
Bitcoin is like cash. If you want to keep all your cash in your house, or buried in a box, you can, but MOST people will think that's too much work and too risky and would rather find a reputable (ha) bank to hold it for them. Convenience and all that.
Just my 0.02 BTC

A few people mentioned this already in replies but it's worth noting that SquareSpace uses Stripe, which might make this the first consumer-friendly implementation of bitcoin acceptance on that easy-of-a-scale that I can think of.
This is really exciting.
