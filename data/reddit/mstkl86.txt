I take 100 at 2.5k each.

The only thing you need to think about for every single investment is the risk profile and if there is any risk assymmetry.
For BTC it is quite obvious.
Forget the predictions, the analysis and all the noises. Focus on the assymmetry of the payoff and keep calm.

In Switzerland we have the same things in place.
I took DBK as an example of big magnitude. It is not your average landesbank that poses systemic risk.
From an empirical perspective, every deduction is compensated by an other party.
In any cases, we are on the same page. There are limited guarantees for cash and cash is on tje balance sheet.

This is false.
All the CASH held in bank accounts IS actually in the bank balance sheet. Investments are not.
If the bank defaults, files for bankruptcy etc etc the government CAN secure the deposits up to XXX amount. It is not the banks that guarantee the deposits. It is tax money that will eventually cover those guaranteed deposits.

I would use GDAX. 
Litterally 10 minutes to be verified and 1 day (open business day, thats what it took from a Swiss Bank) to send 89.75 EUR, for example, to have your bank account verified.
You sell and you withdraw. Ask for a 100K daily withdrawal limit. They give it easily. You are not limited on sales amount.

Underrated comment ;)

Assuming it is not deutsch bank that is defaulting. In that case, it is ultimately tax money that will compensate the lack of funds in the institution.
In any cases, cash is in the balance sheet. Instead of the government it is your mentioned institution or the government that secure the deposits. Not the defaulting bank itself.
As a final tought, one may argue that the contribution made to the institution are tax deductible. Hence, it is, at the end of the day, the tax payers that are paying it.

But but but I thought that we were ready to welcome institutional money ?
Rofl !!!! Delusional kids are not realising that the market is way to tiny to welcome any substantial orders without crashing/pumping it.
Let the "BTC volume is 6bn a day you dumb fuck" comments flow.

It is essentially because BTC has a max supply that it has value or has a perceived value.

There are not any big money here. Just few so called frustrated "whales" that are not big enough to rule the traditional markets and that try to play tough.
Stop dreaming. When the big players will come, we won't see double digits monthly returns anymore.
Crypto is a kindergarten sandbox for them for the time being.

Good read, thanks.
on the gold bars:
You can buy Physical Gold Bars, that have a unique identification number tag &amp; a corresponding certificate, starting 10 GR (~0.3 Oz) all the way to 12.5 KG.
I do not think any individual can purchase bigger Gold Bars. You can buy lots of 12.5KG though.
I do not understand your 5.7mio figure / 486Oz.

If it is at the market, immediately. If it is limited, when the price reaches the limit you set. Binance and crypto in general work 24/7

Thanks to that, there is a market.
It would not be possible to trade otherwise xD
When you sell, someone is buying and thinks he is smarter and vice versa.
