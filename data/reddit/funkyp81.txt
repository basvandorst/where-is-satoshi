How comes you couldn't see that someone was giving you there Bitcoin address for refund and it wasn't even me talking to you on support tickets. Absolute joke 17 Bitcoins you sent to someone i even told you i got a email saying attempt made on my account from unknown ip and ignore if not me  and 15 mins later the same person with that ip address is messaging you asking for a refund and got my 4 digit code even telling you exactly what he's doing in my account archiving old bitcoin address.

Tell me about it Frankeh because of this i got hacked over email and someone messaged Blockchain support with my id and passsword and while im waiting for a reply from them this person is asking for a refund to his Bitcoin address .. oh and he got it 17 Bitcoins

What about when on 15th Dec i got email from you Confirmation Required An attempt has been made to login to your My wallet account from ip address 80.243.180.98. Enter the confirmation code below to access your account. If it was not you who made this login attempt you can ignore this email.
2014-12-15 23:32:21     and  15 mins later this same ip address is messaging your support asking for a refund to his Bitcoin address not only that telling you he's taken off my 2fa but i didn't get any notification it was done. ive seen messages now and he left his ip address on one of them as it had attachment. Looks like ive done the investigating for you 17 Bitcoins ive lost not once but twice. 
Very unhappy customer Paul R

I wish i saw these messages before on 15th Dec when they ask for wallet id and password from me i just thought it must be ok to do that.
17 Bitcoins down to a Hacker now i know different but then you don't expect your messages to there support to be intercepted pretending there you and asking for a refund. Problem is they have all your passwords to quote to them  :(

On the 15th Dec i reported a hack of 17 bitcoins to Blockchain and i got email asking for my wallet id and pass i didn't want to   to be honest but they requested to investigate. what happened after i had someone pretending to be me messaging there support saying he took off my 2fa giving my wallet id and pass and transactions in my wallet and worst of all giving his bitcoin address for refund im so upset they let this happen and i didn't even receive any notification my security was taken off. Shouldn't i have got an email??    ive even seen this hackers ip address as he put an attachment on a message which left a ip marker and Blockchain refusing to help me.

I didn't have any funds to move 17 bitcoins got taken from this johoe fella then Bitcoin on a support ticket refunded to someone else pretending he's me giving his bitcoin address. Of course he's got my wallet id and password as i just sent Blockchain the info over email why did they request it to investigate my account???  ... Honestly you couldn't make this up so i basically got hacked twice everything i owned in bitcoin gone

yes it was that johoe hack originally cleared me out and when i reported it asked my wallet id and pass next day had to contact support said they sent refund to some new bitcoin address and thats when i saw all the fraud messages going on through the bloody night when im asleep :(     
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:57:17
No i replied to Blockchain over email/support ticket my wallet id + password see there message to me  Hi Paul! 
It is likely that the recent security issue is why your wallet is showing a zero balance. In order to properly investigate, we will need your wallet identifier and your password, so we can verify that the address that was stolen from was generated within your wallet.

No mate i had 17 BTC in my Blockchain wallet until this Joehoe had me on his hack list i reported it as soon as i realised it was gone thats when it all went wrong somehow messages were being intercepted by a hacker. what annoys me i stated 3 times im missing 17 BTC to support now look at one of his message below completely different amount.
How many times I must provide it.. Tihis is third time:
ID: 8000
Password: gren
On December, 3 I had a backup amount what I had in the account.
$ 6,201.87 16.38236162 BTC
After that date I had 2 incoming payments of total: 2.2 BTC. 16.382 + 2.2 BTC = 18.582BTC is missing totally!!

The funds were sent via this transaction -  You can see the funds were sent there.  The refund was sent to the exact address you specified. There is no way for us to resend this. 
3    yes using BCI Generated address 
4    Using OS Windows

@_date: 2015-07-04 18:34:22

Thanks NotHyplon i spoke to a crypto consultant last week who works for company im in he said no way should they have asked for my wallet id + password over email / support ticket and they could have investigated without he said he will check the taint analasys for me on transaction ??
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:54:15
n1nj4 sorry mate not sure what that means??  That was the hacker talking to Blockchain going through my transactions and requesting a refund
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:37:57
To be honest berra i was a newbie to BTC i was getting paid my wages and Blockchain my first wallet. Having 2fa thought that was ok 
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:12:01
100% correct my friend about 11.30pm last time i spoke to there support to give my id + pass left it to morning i had to contact them only to be told refund been sent where i specified obviously not me messages going on through the night. Also about the support conversation he was definitely riding off the back of mine look below top one is mine and underneath is the hacker  Hi Kevin im so worried right now my wallet identifier is 8000a68b-a890-4541-bfdc- my password gren really annoying i even setup the 2 factor authentication i never expected this to happen

Thanks rydan for reply if that johoe just gave everyone's bitcoins back to owners i wouldn't be in this mess Leaving it up to Blockchain to refund has lost me 17 BTC .. so ive literally lost this twice!!   
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:06:35
Exactly what i mean to be hacked once is unlucky but for someone to get my Johoe refund acting as me is just crazy!! 
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:02:19
Cheers gw for reply  i was reading someones comments on here and he had it spot on about asking wallet id and password.   what if someone else intercepts the email and then sends it to blockchain themselves, claiming that they control that account? I can see using PGP or something similar to communicate and send username/pw but just sending it through regular email is absurd.  
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:01:04
I had 2FA  also why didn't i receive notification this hacker took it off in my back office he messaged support that he done it this is below message.    
I was just wondering how can you access my wallet if I have 2step verification added (Code to Email) !?? I have removed it now and BTC address with security issue effects moved to Archive.
