I think by


they mean wallet.

Or Spanish, or American... it's more about the politicians.

Did you really think these stupid mantras that have been repeated since the cold war would add anything new to the conversation? Read up a little instead of just babbling. Communism is about worker ownership of the means of production. It is about fair compensation for one's labour. It is about the people controlling the state and its affairs for the general welfare instead of the profit of very few.


Funny you should say that considering the egregious human rights violations that have been carried out and continue to be carried out everyday in the name of capitalistic "freedom".

They crave that currency.

If you have an offline wallet the government can absolutely seize your bitcoins. If you have an online wallet it depends on whether the server is on the government's jurisdiction. It may not be on yours', but you can bet your ass it's in some government's jurisdiction.

this is the best free market you're gonna get because the government can't let millions of people die of preventable causes so it funds the adoption of the system

Wut? There are no special regulations on crypto markets and coinbase is still the biggest player despite being crappy and having huge fees, as seen here. The free market is bull and it doesn't ensure best quality at all. Just higher profits for the people owning the machinery and worse conditions for workers operating them everywhere.

It's a series of words you input into a wallet that gets turned into a bitcoin key through an algorithm. Seeds as a general concept are used in many other areas of computer science.

No doctors are refusing care. Single-payer is possible and it is done in many places, more efficiently managing the expenditure than the private system. Your anarcho-capitalist delirium simply doesn't apply, sorry.

you kinda are though. don't expect u to realize it.

People not dying &gt; people dying. It really is that simple.

Let me do it this time:

This is such a bad argument. The system is bad so we shouldn't do anything about people literally dying because they can't afford to live?

Ok dude, you don't even know what communism is, I gave you the main policy point of a socialist system that looks to transition into communism (which has nothing to do with everyone being a servant to everyone else you fuckin moron, it's just taking away corporate dominion over government and production). I made no appeal to emotions in my entire comment. I'm done.
