I feel exactly the same as you but smaller scale went from 23 000 to 13 000 in a week. I felt the pressure but not going to sell. However i did brought with borrowed money. 3000 to be exact.  Sometimes in life you have to take changes and not every one has some 10k laying around to lose. We students deserve a change too.
You just have to know that if it goes zero you got a way to repay the depth.
Once it's about 20 000 in euro's I'll get rid of half to pay this depth and some pocket money. Then keep playing with house money.
