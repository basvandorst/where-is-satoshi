So accurate lmao
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:12:20
May I ask why?
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:56:57
Look at decentralized exchanges. It works better with decentralized coin and greatly improve your privacy.
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:33:44
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:26:46
It makes me laugh so hard thanks
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:19:09
I'm a normal Guy, I see boobs I upvote.
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:09:25

@_date: 2019-07-23 16:35:50
Your dad seems so encouraging, I'm jealous.
@_date: 2019-07-24 22:33:14
I'm PROUD to also get it son !
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:56:50
You won't avoid Bitcoin to drop in price, even Chuck Norris cannot remove nor ignore the incoming bear market.
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:02:56
Thank you, this sub looks more and more like Kids looking daily at the price. Sad world.
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:01:49
OP don't this is a scam.
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:47:06
Just use Bisq ? PayPal is not recommanded for what you are trying to do.
@_date: 2019-11-20 06:45:49
You're welcome mate
@_date: 2019-11-19 22:25:18
Bisq is anonymous and decentralized
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:39:02
BTC ?
@_date: 2019-11-26 15:26:45
Don't die of hunger please, uh ?
@_date: 2019-11-30 10:01:10
It's an awesome idea !
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:11:53
He's right sorry
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:00:33
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:18:21
For all folks here please invest in an hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:07:14
Why a fight? Can't both coexist ?
@_date: 2019-08-01 23:06:50
Why, if I may ask ?
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:00:38
@_date: 2019-10-13 08:37:12
I would say the most objective answer would be to tell you to look what is Bitcoin, blockchain, how they works, what is an hardware wallet, an exchange, how they work, and then if you have any questions come back to us, but at this point it seems you didn't do any search by yourself which is your first mistake.
@_date: 2019-08-01 23:06:16
Claro que si (that's all I can say sorry)
@_date: 2019-08-10 20:38:07
Interesting thanks for your comment.
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:59:23
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:32:27
C'mon just why ?
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:08:33
Am I the only one bored to read this kind of question of no interest about price ? As if the people didn't care about all the tech behind, come on.
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:46:49
Just buy a Ledger Nano S/X or a Trezor. And please do not give your seed to anyone.
If your house burn or your Ledger Nano is destroyed you can get all you coin back using your seed.
@_date: 2019-10-01 07:20:24
Cringe af to be honest.
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:05:13
It looks like another dumb fork of BTC, something like LBTC. 
But more seriously well done !
@_date: 2019-10-13 09:03:49
THIS, try to learn the technologies and how it works, not to ask any financial advices, because people are sharks.
@_date: 2019-10-14 17:35:51
I personally prefer GMT 09:17
@_date: 2019-08-24 02:00:03
Thank you sir
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:19:32
Sorry can someone explain me ?
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:28:24
Please can anyone provide me sources of this vidéo, at least who is this fantastic Guy ?
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:38:45
I feel embarrassed.
@_date: 2019-10-29 11:26:35
You could've ask Google first I guess, check what is an exchange and then which suit the best your needs.
@_date: 2019-10-14 21:05:44
Well said !
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:36:10
First do your own research on the internet. Then don't believe any strangers that pretend to help you. Don't believe anyone, even me.
@_date: 2019-12-24 09:22:12
I agree.
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:47:35
It looks interesting, thanks for sharing, I see a great TA here.
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:14:49
What does it mean please ? Do you earn some BTC like mining ?
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:55:23
I'm happy for you, of course, how could I be jealous uh ?
@_date: 2019-12-15 10:23:10
I agree so much
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:55:17
Much wow ! Nice doge
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:42:06
Why ? You can own Bitcoin and still buy instead of renting nah ?
@_date: 2019-09-15 15:58:46
Ledger Nano, the hardware wallet yes
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:36:30
THIS kind of bullshit.
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:13:51
Much wow!
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:22:40
Of course, it is a decentralized exchange. What we should all be using instead of the centralized crap owned by compagnies.
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:58:30

@_date: 2019-09-20 05:37:41
