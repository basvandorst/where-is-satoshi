i'm sorry what world did you come from?
because on Earth, Microsoft has a 90% + market share since inception ....
Apple has't had a over 10% market share EVER


maybe in silicon valley, but not "The World"

bill gates sold MS DOS to IBM long before woj made apple
please bro, i've been alive long enough to know this
MS has a desktop monopol since ever and it will continue to have it for a long time to come
edit: this is not true, but still MS is still and has always been the king of desktops whether we like it or not

maybe so, but in the next 3 decades or so, MS has a 90% market share
who gives a shit about first 30k units? the OP said THE WORLD to which i replied world within silicon valley which 30k units fits more nicely, no?

is it though?
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:57:20
banks are thieves for creating money out of thin air and charging you for using it, ie interest
that's the real theft
the fact that they manipulate every market they participate in, is just a side effect, they're all corrupt and they all manipulate, but interest are the real theft. and crypto takes away that.

lmao at people who think a few bitcoin hodlers will replace banks
motherfucking banks
and yes i know about satoshis whitepaper, fuck I even read it, but look around bro, does it appear to you banks are a dying bread? they control everything, they're not going anywhere in any foreseeable future.

cia&amp;nsa with the intention to make as much black money as possible for financing black ops
satoshi is probably dead already (either Hal who was sick or anybody else, they got rid of once he served his purpose)
heck bitcoin even survived because of silk road
and now we're seeing "the oldest wallets" with 800 million $ of bitcoins being moved and liquidized 
right .....
and that's not CIA ?
convince me otherwise
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:49:40
member when somebody called bitcoin a stablecoin? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:28:45
why would you dump your parents?
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:08:09
you did see me mention "black ops"?
why not? where do you think they get money for black ops and why do you think they say CIA is one of the biggest drug dealers in the world?
*right mind* lol
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:17:39
because black ops are usually illegal, like funding rebels to overthrow governments and such, these things cannot be funded from budget, hence black ops
and bitcoin is not a threat to central banks lmao
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:46:31
didn't they? when all this broke loose maybe 6 months ago? didn't they show some bank accounts from some tax heavens they didn't want public?
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:38:33
a bit ? you can crash bitcoin price with probably less than a million dollars.

i never got this, what exactly does it mean to eat a dick
cut it off and litterally eat it
or just suck it, like Marilyn manson style, remove a rib and voila, eating dick
not that i think McAfee will do either of these things, but just wondering
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:18:37
If that were true we wouldn't have so many lambos driving around.
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:48:40
Some would argue that inflationary currency is what brought us the progress in the last decades. When the dollar value was tied to the gold value back in the 70ties we did not see such exponential progress growth
  
Bitcoin does not offer this, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I'm not an economist.

he's already done it
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:15:18
we owe so much money, nobody will pay that back, *ever*
so if we know this, why do we support a system where debts don't have to be payed ... and if debts don't have to be payed, why not give a billion $ to everyone?
why someone people yes, most people no?
it's hypocrisy at it's finest

some have lower withdrawal fees than others but yeah it's just business but it doesn't mean we should tolerate it 
it costs them nothing, small withdrawals are automatic or at least should be and it litterally costs them nothing to send you your coins/tokens
it's like mobile operators charging for SMS ... it costs them 0 when you send it, unlike a phone call which burdens their infrastructure, SMS does not, which it makes this one of the biggest telecom scams
just saying, if it doesn't cost them anything, they shouldn't charge it. and it would be better for the users. sometimes you gotta compromise, why do you think google has most of their products for free ?
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:23:24
that looks fine imo, but i still don't get curved edge
what is this like a 4th generation curved edge?

so, what's your moon?
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:15:30
they make millions off trading bro every day, i think they could survive the withdrawal fees
and what this does is, it discourages users from withdrawing which makes them keep coins on the exchanges
which just attracts scammers and hackers, why you think every day some exchange gets hacked? 
so they should ABOLISH withdrawal fees altogether so we can move coins freely and be safer because of it
but please let's excuse binance which makes 2.3 million $ a day .... those hefty withdrawal fees, they will sure be left hungry because of it huh ? poor exchanges really ... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:40:04

some would argue that humans saw the big industrial revolution mostly because of inflationary currency
crypto don't offer that ... capitalism needs loans to work best.
i'm not saying crypto is bad, it's just incompatible with current system and thus big changes will be needed
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:24:54
this is so wrong it's stupid
so decentralized way to move assets from one person to another has no intrinsic value ?
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:55:02
this is silly, of course there is not enough paper money and not because it's a scam but because the ratio of circulated supply vs all supply
that's intentional
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:56:29
What's the difference ?
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:12:18


No, they're *literally* printing money -.. and that means on paper AND digitally in the computer . so yes they DO create money out of thin air.
BUT not every bank, only central banks. A government takes a loan. The central banks create the money. Every time.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:24:04


paper comes in, money comes out

Tea, Eal Grey, Hot ... 
Money, 200 billion, greeeeeeeen , hmmmmm
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:58:20
you're partially right bro but chose the wrong words
money does get created with new debts, but not every bank does this, only central banks which control the currency supply, inflation and so on
if i lend you 1000$ , the supply will stay the same, if the government borrows 100 million, FED creates it.
you are right tho, that crypto doesn't offer this mechanism but whether inflationary currency is good or bad is a different debate entirely
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:21:13
That's what happens when nobody wants to help you in this day and age.
Is it right though, that we let whole countries starve just because we don't like their oil policy. or they won't let us buy their oil companies and banks?
yeah fuck them let them starve to death, we'll take their oil after!

yes and regular banks don't create money when lending out deposits


this is just wrong
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:43:13
what's the difference? bank spent my money and now are using my money to bail it self out which means pay me back ...
it's literally the same

you heard of greece, malta? cyprus?
in fact deposits are only insured up to 100k i believe in EU

so many economists itt
i'll just say this, everybody looking up to Switzerland
they've been *literally* laundering money for the mafia ever since the Roman Empire times . They laundered money for the nazis, the jews, ALL OF THEM
So when you tell me, look what's Switzerland is doing, i don't really hold very high regard.
If banks are evil, Switzerland is their home land!

stock trading is not gambling lol ....
