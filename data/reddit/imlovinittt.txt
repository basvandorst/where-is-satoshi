Make sure you are using google chrome and that you have a phone number connected to your account.

Damn Idk then, I was able to send my crypto back with no problem after I switched my browser.

It kind of worked, the bid ask spread kind of destroys your profit margins but I was able to make a quick 13%. if you actively watch the spreads and just put in some limit orders you can actually get a decent return.

The only crypto/crypto pair they have is BCC/BTC, otherwise you have to sell the crypto to get USD then buy another crypto and transfer it. I’m gonna exploit it as much as I can but I have to watch the spreads and make the trades accordingly, it’s not as simple as just buy, sell, repeat but if you monitor the premiums you can get a guaranteed decent return. I personally sold BTC bought Litecoin and moved it out but right now that pair isn’t profitable.

It looks like you can trade Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Litecoin on golix (all at different premiums). I haven’t tried it yet but the crypto withdrawal feature looks pretty sound, I’m gonna try it with a small amount tomorrow (like $20) I’ll let you guys know if it works.

This is what I was going to do. On their support page it only says you can't transfer USD outside of the country, it doesn't say anything about other cryptos. In looking at the price of the cryptos they offer they all are trading at different premiums so its's just a matter of finding the currency pairs with the largest premium (to sell on the golix exchange) and the smallest premium (to buy on the golix exchange and transfer to the U.S.)
