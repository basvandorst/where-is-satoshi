unless of course am downloading the code and compiling it or even consume via a continuous build with Travis or the like with hash checks on GitHub.
therefore trust is retained, as is the the transparency of process


please see [Overcast]( as a worthwhile example
ps: am not begrudging your OSS contributions - THANK YOU for these. Merely when dealing with folks' sweat-earned $'s - and the fact that it is 2017, closed source seems the antithesis of the mantra of blockchain and associated technologies.

to speak of transparency throughout the "movement", and to leave out the entirety of the source code, seems odd
don't misunderstand, it is beautiful, and highly functional - but given the lack of recourse in dealing with digital assets, the need to have as much audit trail through verification of code in the public domain is paramount.
commercially, building a community around a product which folks love, share and get behind - can turn to then a source of revenue via donations. can't speak for all; but personally spend nearly 1k per year on open-source software donations / subscriptions to remove ads, and so forth
please make this 100% open source
