Not saying I agree with the premise of the article, but many Africans have SMS-based dumb cell phones and there are services in Africa that allow for bitcoin transfers using such tools. This is largely how M-Pesa functions. Again, not saying bitcoin will change the game in Africa, but there are smart people attempting to work around the technological limitations there to make bitcoin transfers easy and feasible.

You may be right. I'm by no means an expert but I've been invested in bitcoin since late 2013 and the whole experience has taught me that there's no predicting the future. I always said if something else came along that might have some added or separate value from bitcoin, I'd invest a little in it, which is what I just did with Ethereum. I'd rather risk losing a small investment and be wrong than miss out on a potential opportunity. It's a big if for sure and could be rendered useless.

Mt Gox and skirting taxes are irrelevant to OP’s point. The real point is that exchanges and brokers are for buying coins and should then be immediately offloaded to a wallet in which you yourself control the private keys or else you’re not taking full advantage of the decentralized, censorship free aspects of Bitcoin, the very features that make it special. Sure, most people probably will, sadly, leave their coins with custodial services in the longterm and I assume in the present. But if you’re a remotely above average user, it’s worth using bitcoin as intended.

I see your point. To play devil's advocate, I think a lot of people are speculators first and then become more excited and decide to dig deep into the tech and transform into people who appreciate the value of bitcoin.

I’ve been around the same amount of time and I think they are delusional and it’s a slippery slope when you increase blocksize. One days it’s 2mb then it opens the door for future blocksize increases and centralization risks. I respectfully disagree

Right now, a lot of sites make you sign in with your Facebook account or Amazon account to establish identity and ensure you don’t have to re-enter all of the identification information (ie name, birth date, place of residence) those two sites already have on you. But they are centralized services prone to hacks, and they sell your data for the price of efficiency. Microsoft and others are working on decentralized means of establishing identity using a blockchain (and the tweet may imply the Bitcoin blockchain is the one chosen for this project) to replace those services—the goal is to create a more private, decentralized and efficient means of identification.

I think it's too soon to declare that "alts are simply eating into Bitcoin's market share"--let's see where alts like BCH are in a year or two. Again, I think the rise in price for those coins has more to do with marketing and people trying to get in on "the ground floor" and thinking they missed the train with Bitcoin. I think many of those holders will get burned.
I agree, the timeline is not ideal for LN. I imagine things would've been different had SW been merged two years ago. But the fact is, this is the situation we're in and there's no solution out there right now imo. I don't believe blocksize increases are the answer, let alone an answer, for longterm scaling. If you're advocating for a block size increase in the short term, I'm curious to know what the increase would need to be to handle the current transaction load? I genuinely don't know, but I think it's more than 2-4 mb. Then how soon is it before we're risking centralization due to low node counts? There are tradeoffs. Roger Ver likes to say that many "small blockers" don't use Bitcoin often. It's true of me, I'll be honest. I'm happy to wait for the right solution and send limited transactions in the interim. I respect that others feel differently, but I think the majority of users who even care about the scaling debate share my view.

I don’t live in a fantasy world where I think Bitcoin’s, or even more generally cryptocurrency’s, success is a guarantee long term. But I don’t view Bitcoin’s total crypto market share dropping as being majorly affected by Bitcoin’s current fees. I think it has much more to do with the creation and rise of other coins, some that are worthy innovations that garner real communities and others that are shitcoins that people buy cheap because they think they missed the BTC train. I think it’s ridiculous to think Bitcoin could maintain such a dominant market share in a new industry where competitors were bound to pop up. That’s like saying Facebook is at fault for not having close to 100 percent dominance of the social media space because Twitter, Instagram, and others have humongous user bases. The fact is that there are alts w different value propositions that led to BTC’s decline in terms of market share dominance. Just my two satoshis.

While I would NEVER recommend day trading or even trading in general, I used to be a huge skeptic re: TA yet my friend has been studying it for the past 3 years and consistently uses it to great effect to make a profit. And I've seen great improvements in his price predictions--I used to dismiss him 3 years ago and by this year I'd say he's successful 70-80% of the time. I know nothing about TA, but judging solely by the results, he seems to use it well. I think most people who dismiss TA probably have never studied it long enough to understand how to utilize it effectively.

Because there is such little volume on BCH. This is why BTC fees were cheap up until recently. If BCH blocks ever filled up, fees would get high and then they’d up the blocksize again thus increasing centralization due to fewer people being able to run nodes. This is short term and if you don’t understand that you need to do more research. I don’t mean to be harsh and apologies if you knew this already but it’s scary seeing the amount of uninformed noobs in both subs, especially those getting duped in rbtc.

He is the most eloquent speaker in the space and has an incredible ability to distill complex concepts into their simplest form.  And he speaks in a way that in inspiring and educational. I do not exaggerate when I say that I would estimate his generous explanations over the years have likely persuaded an indeterminate number of people to invest in bitcoin (through education, not shilling or selling), totaling what’s now worth hundreds of millions, possibly billions in gains. In 2013, he was a large reason I came to understand bitcoin’s potential and took the plunge.

Also, applications like this are a strong reason to support layer two solutions because blockchains, even with blocksize increases, simply cannot scale to the level needed to allow for such use cases.

First, thank you for your contributions. I'm not a coder, but I have been closely following Bitcoin every day for around two years now so I keep up with the technical aspect as much as I can, but bear that in mind. How close are most of these solutions to being workable AND user friendly? I.e. lightning network, sidechains (I know the alpha was just released, but I'm talking for use en masse), etc. that could bring about off-chain solutions to the scalability issue. I ask because AFAIK most devs in the 8/20 MB camp seem to argue that the network will face issues/potentially full blocks regularly well before those solutions are deployable. Do you agree with that assessment? If so, do you agree a blocksize increase of some sort is necessary in the short term to mitigate the risk of those issues absent off-chain solutions being workable in time? Or do you think that risk of network cloggage is overblown? Thanks in advance.

That's obviously true to a large degree, but the core devs are working on open source software, on a public email chain, on a public coding forum that is transparent and visible to the public. There's really no helping that at this point, and they are vulnerable to checks like hard forks in case things get out of hand and the majority of the community is not content with the pathway they are taking Bitcoin down. 
I also feel that the fact that this is effectively their technological baby that they want to see succeed, and don't have business interests at stake (I don't count personal investment here as the same thing), so it is my belief that they want to do whatever they think is most likely to help the tech succeed. But mining pools on the other hand are businesses that want to grow as large as possible, and GHash has made it clear from their statement yesterday that they want to grow infinitely and do not care about breaching the 51 pct barrier, despite the fact that they are clearly hurting Bitcoin (at the very least the morale of the user base) in doing so. I, like many others, propose all P2P mining, and that's obviously easier said than done, and I'm not technical enough to know how to push that, so perhaps you could call that a cop out, but that is the solution. We NEED decentralization in mining or Bitcoin is not Bitcoin. Just a note, I'm not an anarchist, I just believe that companies are understandably self-interested, and an industry cabal of mining pools is necessarily going to be self-interested. It is in their nature to protect the protocol to a degree, of course, but they will understandably try to balance that with their endeavor to make as much profit as possible, and that will often come at the expense of the former as witnessed last weekend.

I think he's just saying that Bitlicenses effectively create a scenario where you have "clean coins" that are held by people who use those businesses with Bitlicenses versus "unclean coins" that are held by people who are "evading" the so-called regulated bitcoin businesses. The "clean coins" are NYCoin in this scenario, and could threaten the fungibility of bitcoin in a sense.

That's a fair point, but I think a "game-changer" is a bit too strong. Ultimately, in my opinion, adoption will come if people have very obvious incentives, as a consumer/financial participant, to own bitcoin, not through ease of purchase/acquisition. Just me two satoshis.

I see your point, but, though I respect the developers, I have no need to trust them. They are working transparently discussing things out in the open on the bitcoin dev email chain, merging pull requests on Github, and effectively doing as much as possible in an open-source manner. Are things going on behind closed doors? Sure. But, ultimately, the open-source nature of Bitcoin renders trust unnecessary; the code is out in the open.
I think this sort of aspect needs to be better understood by the public and regulators, yet it will take time and much educating. New things tend to face skepticism from those who don't understand them initially.

New rap: Enter Satoshi- 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:42:01
I met him once a few years ago at some event Barry Silbert was speaking at. I asked him why he was so bearish and his answer essentially boiled down to how he’s seen his students lose a lot of money speculating on other risky assets in the past, I think particularly during the 2008 market crash, and he didn’t want the same to happen again. But he wasn’t as anti-bitcoin in person—it was more of a don’t invest more than you can afford to lose attitude. But I was both a tad amused to meet professor bitcorn and intrigued and when he gave me his card we started emailing a bit. It quickly became clear he was a perma bear and when I pushed him a little too hard he eventually stopped responding. That’s my Professor Bitcorn story. 
Edit: I just dug up those emails for fun and I forgot something important—he told me at the event that he invested in Bitcoin and thought it had upside but felt it was critical to talk about its weaknesses. I pressed him as to why his journalistic persona was so much more bearish than his in-person persona. But he told me he invested back in early 2014!
Edit 2: He ultimately revealed himself to be a “Blockchain not Bitcoin” kind of guy.
Edit 3: Finally, I politely called him out on the false claims he made in the testimony he gave at the NY hearings in 2014. I then asked him if he would be willing to do an AMA in rbitcoin. He never responded to that part of my email. I reiterated in another response, respectfully, and asked if he still stood by his $10 prediction and he never responded again. :)

I am not his student, but I met him at a MarketWatch event earlier this year. He is a nice enough guy to be honest, and I spoke to him extensively, and emailed with him a bit (he encouraged me to, which was a nice offer) because he said many positive things to me about bitcoin--he even owns bitcoin. But then when he gets on stage or is quoted in the press, he totally becomes an extremist. He told me that some of his students lost a lot of money in the December crash, so I think that might be part of why he acts the way he does. He really is extremely uninformed, though. He was telling me how he'd heard of paper wallets at the event like it was some novel thing at the time. He is all about risk aversion and for that reason, he just follows that theme along ad nauseam, and it clouds his views imo. I think he comes from a good, yet quite misinformed place where he feels protective, though obviously we are all headed to the moon and he will know that he is wrong eventually. The last email I sent him was in March asking if he still stands by his prediction, and he never responded.

1) Practically speaking, they depend on the core protocol and thus it is in their best interest financially to contribute to an underfunded, under-resourced group of developers who could make or break these companies' livelihood depending on whether or not core development can keep up with network growth.
2) Personally I think contributing to the core project that makes the existence of your business possible is the "right" thing to do. That's my opinion, but I'm sure many disagree. Either way,  seems critical from a business standpoint.

You're a bit off here. I'm not going to claim to be an expert on this, I'm far from it, but I've been writing an article on Bitcoin's potential impact on remittances recently and devoting a lot of time researching the internet/mobile climate in the developing world, particularly East Africa. Though you're right that some nations have populations that are largely internetless, computerless, etc, MANY, possibly most people in Uganda and the rest of East Africa have sms-based phones, and use them in conjunction with existing mobile banking infrastructures. Check out M-Pesa if you haven't heard of it. It's usable from any sms-based phone and it now comprises around 40% of the GDP in Tanzania and Kenya only 6 years after it was really launched. 37coins and other bitcoin companies are creating mobile wallets that are usable from SMS-based phones. Other companies are creating other solutions that don't involve internet connections. What you're saying is certainly true in many places, but it's something that is changing, and I wish there were more companies like 37coins specifically designed to serve populations at certain technological levels that might be lower than the rest of the world. Good work is being done nonetheless, and it's quite encouraging. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:30:58
I'm not circle jerking over anything, I'm merely pointing out that you are absolutely incorrect. It's not a victory for Bitcoin, the price itself is largely unimportant. You are also picking a given time range--I could do the same and point out a humongous increase. My point is that he is factually incorrect--his prediction was exact in both price and timing, and it is wrong (though I guess he has thirty days). My other point is that this is a pointless debate.

Calling for decentralization in money transfer and with Bitcoin-related entities is not at all the same thing as advocating anarchy.

These things will either fall into line or they won't, but aside from number 1, the others are aspects simply must fall into line, and they either will or won't depending on the apps that develop, the progress of Bitcoin Core, and other non-technical factors falling into place.

I posted a thread a few weeks ago which got downvoted. Apparently people thought I was trying to promote Bitcoin via charity rather than just help a charity take on an alternative means of payment which could generate additional donations. Worldbuilders is a charity run by Patrick Rothfuss, fantasy author of THE NAME OF THE WIND (incredible book). It is affiliated with Heifer International, which gives livestock to people in developing countries instead of food or money donations, so that these people can have a source of income whether it be eggs from a chicken, milk from a cow, etc. It's a great charity and Pat seemed interested in Bitcoin. I contacted his support staff and they are intrigued, but not quite there. It'd be great if people sent a short message to questions urging them to accept Bitcoin for donations. I told them that Bitpay processes for free for charities already.

I'm sure that wasn't your intention, but it comes off that way to me. I'm more enticed by a company telling me they have a feature instead of saying their competitors do not.

Agreed. And I was speaking to remittances yet people are bringing up making purchases which is a different animal, though is making a valid point here regarding that. It also wasn't economical for people to remit $20 or less to family and friends before Bitcoin. This is a new possibility. I know people in Uganda/US who are remitting at this sort of financial level already.

His prediction wasn't vague. He didn't say "the market will crash a huge amount." He said that the market would fall 99% to $10 by Q2 2014. He made a very specific prediction. He his blatantly wrong. Not to mention I have spoken to him in person, and emailed with him on and off, and I can tell you he clearly doesn't understand Bitcoin, and generally doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about. It is a simple fact of numbers, and specific predictions, but more than that as well. He is an old-school, traditional currency guy trying to make predictions about a whole new animal that is an experiment that could certainly fail, but it is unchartered territory. Predictions are idiotic in general, and he had little to no basis for his, which makes it even stupider. He basically picked a random number and a random date, so excuse me if I don't put much stock in what he said. He gave little to no analysis for his prediction.

Additionally, many people who are aware of the charity, but live abroad and don't have means of donating due to lack of credit cards or whatnot might have an alternative means of donation if Bitcoin were to be accepted. The fact is, it stands do no harm and might even do a lot of good. Why wouldn't they accept it and why wouldn't I suggest it?

Satoshi certainly foresaw some potential expansion/bitcoin 2.0 applications of the blockchain. I don't care to go through the original bitcoin talk forum chains again to be honest, but with respect to digital property and whatnot, he absolutely foresaw future possibilities. That is inventing something to offer more possibilities and innovation in my mind. And I didn't say why it was invented, I said what it is. You can apply your ideology here, but the fact that people who don't share your views still embrace bitcoin is proof to me that it is open to other beliefs.

Yet the cigarette smoker (I am not one fwiw) has at least done a rudimentary job weighing the costs vs. the benefits, and has decided to smoke. Or they are just plain old addicted and unable to overcome that addiction despite knowing the health risks. I just don't think this analogy works at all. Not saying that Bitcoin will ever be widespread, but your comparing a case where being informed has not caused people to quit smoking vs. a case where being uninformed has caused people not to partake (yet). They don't seem to relate. Making a point about understanding not driving a change in behavior is a huge generalization.

Hmm, I guess that $500 billion remittance market is inconsequential. Not to mention the $50 billion in fees that could be greatly reduced. I said under $50, I didn't say under $1 first of all. Secondly, many people would like to send less money more frequently, but can't do so because of the existing fee structures. Many expats/immigrants would send back $20-$50 weekly to their home countries instead of $200+ monthly if they could do so affordably. This is a world of possibility that Bitcoin could unleash.

If you feel such strong hate for Bitcoin, go work for Lawsky. And if Bitcoin has inherent flaws, then it will fail, but it will only lead to the next development of blockchain tech that will improve upon the previous model, perhaps specifically within the parameters you criticize. I'm not saying some of your criticisms aren't fair, but they are potentially conditional upon transaction volume not increasing. And if mining continues to be unprofitable, some miners will drop out, the difficulty will lower, and an equilibrium point will be found once again. That's a beautiful piece of technology in my opinion.

Worldbuilders opened up a changetip and collected as well. To tell the whole story, I'd been emailing with them back and forth to try to get them to accept btc donations for the past few months. They seemed interested, but not ready to commit. When a few of us sent tips to their Twitter account last week, they emailed me inquiring about Changetip, curious to see if it was a scam, and when I let them know it was legit, the act of tipping put them over the edge and they opened up a changetip. Not sure if it will happen, but I recommended they reach out to BitPay and they said they plan to do so. Moral of the story: it's good to try to find someone to contact at the charity so that they can use you as a resource for any questions they might have. Especially considering that a few people, including me, have reported that some charities/individuals initially worry that changetip is a scam when they see the tip pop up.
@_date: 2014-10-08 13:51:33
Centralized, third-party off-chain solutions like Changetip for micropayments/small tips don't seem too problematic for such small amounts of money. Concerning for larger amounts for sure, but tips should be fine. I don't mind trusting Changetip to hold on to $10 of bitcoin for me so that I can send hundreds of small tips with that amount.

Definitely a risk, but if a bunch of people chip in, then it won't take too much time for any individual, and worst case we all waste a few seconds of our time and we learn from our mistake. I think going with a medium-sized charity that doesn't get inundated with Tweets, but still has a public presence is the way to go. Personally, I am a huge fan of Worldbuilders.  
They work with Heifer international, which is a great charity that tries to end world hunger by following the "teach a man to fish" philosophy. They give farm animals to people in the developing world, i.e. a chicken to supply eggs to sell so that people can start their own "small businesses" of sorts using the products their livestock produce. Worldbuilders is headed by  bestselling fantasy author Patrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind/Kingkiller Chronicles). I messaged him on Facebook months ago about accepting btc, he seemed willing, but then his team didn't seem to fully get it when I mentioned how Bitpay could process their donations for free and give them money in local currency. They said they'd bring it up at their next annual meeting, so it could be cool to donate to a great charity that is headed by a nerd, that has considered the idea of accepting btc. Just my two satoshis. 
EDIT: Patrick Rothfuss has a nice following by the way, and a dedicated legion of fans. He's only been on Twitter for a few months and already has 53 K followers.  He's more popular on Facebook (roughly 150k likes on his page).

I agree with that, but Brock isn't targeted for his association to Bitcoin, but for his association with an alleged crime. Like you said, the haters are fierce, and we have enough battles to fight for Bitcoin without fighting battles for people within the space who have fights unrelated to Bitcoin. I'm not saying to throw the guy in the gutter, but rather that a special interest group shouldn't bring unnecessary PR battles upon itself by electing him to its board. That being said, I am torn, a good part of me feels that, if he was truly wrongly accused, he shouldn't miss out on opportunities. But he could've remained a successful entrepreneur in the space without getting heavily caught up in the politics of the foundation. It's a complicated situation.

I'm saying there's a difference between saying drug laws are bad, which I believe they are because they are ineffective and I don't believe someone has the right to decree what drugs I should use, but to totally support drug dealers who are often selling to addicts is another thing imo. I believe a bit of personal responsibility should be employed, and a bit of care for others' well-being should be thought of. I'm against a pure free-market stance when it comes to drugs because it often becomes a situation where drug dealers are taking advantage of an addicted clientele that do not have the faculties to decide when enough is enough. If your view is purely Libertarian, and that everyone should have a right to make their own decisions, I think it's naive to think that a drug addict is capable of making responsible personal decisions.

What is with this fucktard pumping out articles that have nothing to do with the real worth of Bitcoin the technology, and citing issues that are temporary and currently being resolved. It is so fucking uninteresting to cover the kinks that come with a new environment for a nascent tech that will be worked out versus the actual underlying worth of the technology. Journalism click culture is a cancer. He's published one or two semi-decent articles, but how this guy is continually allowed to write about Bitcoin is beyond me. 
Publish things with long-term value, Rob. You think anyone will go back and read this nonsense in few years except to have a laugh? It's like citing how it's hard to send an email in 1993 for the average person. Not apples to apples, but it's something that has nothing to do with the underlying tech, but rather it's a user experience issue that will be smoothed out with time.

An extremely well-done podcast spun-off of NPR's This American Life, separated into 12 30-45 min episodes, that is digging deep into the facts of a murder case from 1999 in which a high school senior outside of Baltimore, Maryland was convicted for strangling his ex-girlfriend. The case was very shaky at best and so a journalist was intrigued and decided to explore further and interview the convict by phone from prison, his friends and family and people who knew the victim to find out more about what actually happened. The guy had an unconvincing motive and doesn't seem like a murderer on the surface. 
However the show will follow a new story next season if they get the funding. The journalist who does it is excellent and arranges a highly compelling narrative.

Perhaps I identify with these sorts of ideas more than I realize, but I definitely think I'm no purist. For example, I'm really against pretty much all regulation with regards to Bitcoin with the exception being that I think exchanges should have to prove solvency in some way, preferably using crypto tools, but then again that's the on-rails and not Bitcoin itself. I don't want another Mt. Gox and I think it's unnecessary to say that the market rooted Gox out of the picture when we can most likely adopt systems to prove solvency and avoid these episodes altogether. 
EDIT: I guess the counterargument to this form of regulation is the development of those tools by individual players in the market, but I don't think it hurts to have a bit of oversight in this area, though regulators get out of hand.


Beautifully said.

I'm none of those things. Bitcoin is more efficient, open, transparent and presents a significantly greater number of possibilities for innovation than the current system. It also potentially allows access to financial services to the unbanked. And the whole remittances aspect. Plain and simple. I think it isn't a myth, but it should be. Nothing against Austrian libertarian anarchists, I just don't identify by labels, and don't see why the system should/is exclusive to those groups.

People  also use those technologies  in different ways, manipulate them, change them, co-opt them for their own purposes. People  also utilize them for different reasons and when a host of people  w varying views adopt a technology for various  reasons, I  would argue the neutrality of a tech has won out in favor of the subjective value of a tech as in intended by the original creator(s) and early users. Neutral in that it is open to a multiplicity of views and beliefs. Perhaps that's stretching  the definition of neutrality but in my view, I think it's appropriate.

He's a moron because he thinks the Mt. Gox failure was a technical issue rather than a management issue that caused technical/security issues. He clearly doesn't know the facts and yet he is speaking with such certainty and passion. He is uninformed and a talking head. And I'm not in favor of regulation, and this seems particularly poorly conceived, but if there are supposedly cyber security checks that would be run, then Karpeles couldn't have sat in a room by himself running the entire operation with poor security mechanisms. He also couldn't have run a fractional reserve bank as it seems he did given the new clauses about proving solvency.

Demand that is exercised through the value someone is willing to pay to buy bitcoin w fiat. Over time demand has increased as more people have become bitcoin enthusiasts and owners. The more people that want in and/or the more people are willing to pay the more the fiat exchange rate increases. Or the opposite. And there is a certain amount of bitcoin produced per hour, day, week etc because of the block reward paid to miners for processing transactions (currently 25 btc per block, though it halves every two years roughly (production is algorithmically controlled)). Therefore demand per day week month etc must exceed the supply of btc produced per day week month etc due to block reward for price to increase. This is oversimplified but a good start I hope.
TL;DR Supply and demand.

I see your point, but in my mind, the issue is related to one of the main reasons why Satoshi created Bitcoin to begin with: from what I can interpret, he believed (as do I) that humans should have less control over financial decision-making where technology can replace such need and allow for greater efficiency, security, and freedom. There are technological safeguards that can be employed to block fraudulent users. Multi-sig escrow services are perfect for this sort of thing. Bitcoin and the ancillary aspects of the protocol already self-regulate. Some companies may use a list of blacklisted users in a responsible way, where others may not. There are misunderstandings and mistakes which lead people to have bad credit and lose out on opportunities to have access to financial services. If there is a technological way that is more efficient than the human model, then I say we don't need the human intervention in this particular area. That is by no means a universal statement, but I tend to feel that way when it comes to money in general.

The speech might not have been the most lively, but it was highly informative, concise, and somewhat engaging. I think this is quite a harsh/overly dramatic response.

@_date: 2014-10-08 14:25:05
Just a thought: if Bitcoin follows the path that Amir hopes it will, that would most likely result in smaller adoption levels, no? And, if that is the case, the volatility will still remain high, as greater liquidity would prevent whales and bitcoin-wealthy individuals from being able to manipulate the market/price. That being the case, would bitcoin be valuable if it was continuously this volatile? We often talk about how the volatility should inevitably decrease over time with greater adoption. But if Bitcoin remains niche, and adoption doesn't increase drastically, you really couldn't feasibly live off of such a volatile currency given the relative stability of fiat currencies such as the dollar (I'm not talking fiat from developing countries/third world). Which would inevitably mean people would be holding on to fiat or transferring btc to fiat often to keep their wealth somewhat stable. Isn't this problematic? Just food for thought. And I understand the flip side is Bitcoin becoming so centralized as to be a shell of its former self.

"The algorithm that controls supply prevents the amount of Bitcoin to expand to meet increases in demand."
A bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal points, and it can be rolled back even further if the time comes when it's necessary. Which would be like $1-10 million a coin. 
"Design flaws in the model are set in concrete."
Uhh wrong, the code can be altered.

When I realized there was a better, cheaper, easier, faster and more efficient means of money transfer that anyone could use without permission that totally destroyed the conventional model. Not only does it cut out a middle man, but it provides greater security, speed, and ease than services that have put middle men in place to improve those very attributes. Then I realized what it could do for some of the hardest working people in the world who earn very little and still send home money to their families. 
And then BTC 2.0 potential became apparent, and the question switched from "What other functions could the blockchain/Bitcoin be used for?" to "What can the blockchain NOT be used for?" The possibilities are endless. That is fucking exciting.

I think is saying that there's no evidence that Gavin's suggestions are based on his associations versus his own opinions on the best way forward.

And yet, that wasn't his prediction. He predicted that it would essentially be worthless, which it is currently far from being. I really don't care about the whole prediction--to be honest, I've spoken to him in person at a MarketWatch event and via email and he is a nice enough guy, but he is not knowledgeable about Bitcoin based on my conversations with him. He understands the basics, but he is limited in his understanding. That's more problematic than whether or not his prediction was spot on, which I still think it absolutely was not. 
Furthermore, given the price spike in November, in such a short period of time, a drop was anticipated by many people, this was no great prediction. His prediction was much more extreme, and much more specific in timing and price as I have repeated over and over. Lastly, there was news (i.e. China supposedly banning Bitcoin, the incompetence of Mark Karpeles) that has nothing to do with Bitcoin/the blockchain itself that greatly led the downturn. I can tell you from speaking to him that he essentially thinks that Bitcoin is a worthless entity and his prediction is based on the construct itself and not on anticipating some ancillary news story as a catalyst to cause a dramatic price decrease.

Of course, but if bitcoin is more "useful" in that it can be used to purchase more things and spent to buy more services, it will conceivably bring in more consumers. Many people will buy btc because they take the time to understand the value of the tech, but (most) others will need to see some basic advantage to care enough to buy in. It would really help if these companies provided a small discount for paying in BTC. BTC is obviously about way more than paying smaller fees, but it's an obvious advantage, and a lower price will entice people.

I am absolutely against jailing people for drug use, but saying that "people own their own bodies" is a big oversimplification imo. Many people are naive or too young to appreciate the long-term effects and addictive nature of drugs. And once addicted, addicts cannot control their usage. I'm for a Portugal-like system (though I don't live there so it's all from a semi-informed outside perspective) where you provide rehab facilities to people if they choose to take advantage. No jailing. That's a horrible approach.

GO TIPPERS!!
I have spoken to Worldbuilders in the past about accepting Bitcoin, had a few back-and-forths, but they said they would keep it on the table yet weren't interested at the time. I just received this email from them:
Hi [my name]!
Sorry it's taken MONTHS--I did read the article and brought it to everyone's attention, but we all decided Bitcoin integration couldn't be a priority for this year.
Which actually leads me to a question: Now that the Fundraiser is underway again, we've been getting tweets at the Worldbuilders Twitter account mentioning that various users (many from Reddit) are sending us small Bitcoin donations through ChangeTip. What we can't figure out, due to our inexperience with Bitcoin, is if these are legitimate or a scam.
Have you heard of ChangeTip? Is this the window we need to dip our toes in the Bitcoin pool? Or are there piranhas?
Thanks for all the information--we may move slowly, but we get there eventually.
Needless to say I explained the deal to them, and mentioned that they could set up a Bitpay account for free being that they're a nonprofit. I'll keep you posted. 
EDIT: UPDATE: Just received this reply to my email.
"Thanks for the reply, [my name]!
Also, thanks for dragging us kicking and screaming into the 21st century. ;)  I'll pass the info on to Amanda and see if she can get our Twitter account linked to ChangeTip and start an account on Bitpay.  It just makes sense that Bitcoin adopters would be the geek community...

I'm not sure what transpired so I wouldn't presume to pass judgment on Charlie, but if he was laundering money for profit, then he was in it for profits, and not for supporting free market ideals or decentralized currency. And further it would mean he was profit seeking at the risk of causing some degree of damage to the public perception of a young, growing, beautiful tech that supports those ideals. That would piss me off,  but I don't know what happened. I just think people should be a little more cautious before throwing their full support his way.

My point is that if he was prioritizing making a profit through knowingly breaking the law and laundering money through silk road instead of prioritizing building a business that easily facilitates the buying and selling of bitcoin,  then that is not someone who cares more about those ideals than making a quick buck in my opinion. Whether or not you think those laws should exist, when you set up a business in new York w venture capital money, you are implicitly making it known you aim to follow the law whether you agree w it or not. Which I dont for what it's worth. But if his goal was to launder money he didn't need to start a business, hire lawyers, and make public attempts to follow compliance laws. 
And who are you to say who passes or fails a so-called litmus test for supporting the ideals of bitcoin? Get off your high horse. Bitcoin does not represent a singular viewpoint. I support fungibility but I would also hope one of the earliest bitcoin business pioneers would care more about facilitating buying bitcoin for the masses over making money off silk road. Which, for the record, is a hypothetical I'm not saying necessarily transpired.

Your hyper-emotional speech, and your "you'll learn one day" attitude really make you seem like the young one in this scenario to be honest. Not to mention your username...That being said, I largely agree--this guy facilitated the sale of tons of harmful products (weapons and drugs) and potentially tried to arrange an assassination. I know someone who died from drugs purchased via Silk Road. You can say it's a thing of choice, but addiction is a sickness, and people who facilitate the sale of addictive, harmful drugs to addicts deserve to be punished in my opinion. 
However, the facts are unclear as always, but the support for him is quite disappointing to be honest. Especially considering that there are much better uses to an underground (and in the future, decentralized) marketplace beyond drugs, weapons, and other such things. I.e. vaccinations, and medical products that might be difficult to procure locally or expensive through legal channels.

Hey OP, thank you for sharing this. I knew about Aaron Swartz, but not enough. This was an incredible documentary.
Anyone have any concise articles about Aaron's story that are more framed as human interest pieces? I work for a Young Adult publisher and I'd like to propose a biography about Aaron to my boss, and he usually tends to be more partial to the human interest side of stories. This doc is great, but I obviously need to show him something short, in written form to begin. Any suggestions would be great. I've found a few, but not quite what I'm looking for yet.

Be that as it may, it's a crappy part of society, but the reputation of an organization trying to advertise itself as a representative of a young, growing tech is something to think about (all opinions of the foundation's value aside). Charlie Shrem clearly doesn't think he did anything wrong, but he resigned given his legal situation as to separate his troubles from the pursuits of the foundation. My point is that I think the foundation should've thought about its reputation before electing Brock, regardless of the truth of those claims. I'm not saying the guy should be rejected for the rest of his life, but maybe  the foundation shouldn't have welcomed such a PR battle in this instance given its questionable status and the young, growing state of Bitcoin.

I'm not saying the longterm picture in terms of what is beneficial to the world/society in general, I'm saying what is beneficial to the business. If people lose faith in Bitcoin over this issue or others, then GHash is screwed. That's what I'm referring to--the sentiment of the community is important to Bitcoin, and thus GHash's longterm profitability and sustainability.
This sort of answers your second point as well. I'm not saying CEX should care from a moral standpoint, but rather a business standpoint. If the community stops using Bitcoin, mining becomes worthless, and CEX's investment goes down the drain.

No, personally I think Circle is absolute dog shit, but as long as you are creating things like dark wallet, and other innovations arise, and I don't need to use centralized 3rd parties, then people can do as they please. I would not choose to use them myself, but I believe that people who have different opinions should have different options afforded to them. To be honest, perhaps I was harsh in my criticism of your name choice for your project, but I really care about this spreading to underdeveloped areas, and I hope it can really take over the remittances space, so I think good PR is needed to reach that level of adoption, but maybe I'm wrong. And clearly we disagree on what good PR means, and a few other things, but I respect your passion and your position despite my comments not coming off that way previously perhaps. Part of what I love about this community is the diversity of reasons for people being involved, nearly all are welcome. Good day to you, Amir.

Probably because he was invited to the NYDFS meeting to testify, but also because he sets himself up as the Bitcoin Bear and travels around the country seeking any opportunity to speak on it possible.

I'm an editor at a major publisher, and I don't think micropayments are really that relevant to book publishing. Much more so to journalism. As an aside, a large majority of the editors who are editing self-published books on a freelance basis are hacks, or the rare semi-retired gem. But mostly hacks, and so obviously I'm biased here, but editors do a lot more than proofread, they are the lifeblood of a publishing house. But for those who self-publish, this could be an interesting way to employ Bitcoin/micropayments with serialized content perhaps.

So in other words you are criticizing the community's response (a claim which is totally unfounded: dark wallet, open bazaar and mixers), yet your  own response is to create a company which aims to enable other companies to further break down the level of anonymity the protocol allows, thus intentionally pushing measures that may lead to fungibility-destroying decisions.

Fair point, but I'm by no means trying to pick on Mike, and apologize if it comes off that way. I'm more singling out Circle in light of Allaire's recent comments which are quite alarming in my opinion, and clearly many others here agree. I have the utmost respect for Mike, and that's why I am trying to engage him. I won't deny, though, that I'm a bit alarmed by his redlist proposal, given Allaire's past comments that seem to allude to coin validation. That worries me, but I don't jump to conclusions. I ask questions. 
Jeff Garzik for example works for an open-source company and so I'm necessarily less concerned about him than those who are advising companies that have been incredibly non-transparent, in this case Circle, a company that often spouts discourse contrary to what many here feel is the right direction for Bitcoin to move in. That being said, I understand how it can come off as me singling him out, but that isn't my intention in creating this post. It's for the sake of transparency given Circle's closed model.

The credit-card industry is accelerating efforts to keep sensitive customer information out of the hands of merchants, as a rash of data breaches at major U.S. retailers erodes confidence in electronic payment systems.
Visa Inc. V -0.30%  and MasterCard Inc. MA +0.58%  are rolling out technology that replaces cardholder information such as account numbers and expiration dates with a unique series of numbers that validates the customer's identity.
The new technology is expected to get a big boost next week because it will be part of Apple Inc. AAPL -0.83%  's latest iPhone, which for the first time will let customers make payments with the device in brick-and-mortar stores, according to people familiar with the situation. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
The move is part of a broader push by card-issuing banks and merchants to improve security for electronic payments. The vulnerability of merchant systems was highlighted again this week when Home Depot Inc. HD +1.04%  said that it might have been the victim of a data breach.
Called "tokenization," the new technology can be used for online transactions, payments made in a physical store with a smartphone, and with merchant applications that consumers load onto a smartphone. By getting rid of the sensitive card information, banks and merchants can leave hackers with nothing of value to steal if they break into their computer servers.
"There is a recognition that we all need to evolve the payment standards to embrace what is going on around us," said Jim McCarthy, Visa's global head of innovation and strategic partnerships. Hackers increasingly are going after brick-and-mortar stores. Target Corp. TGT +1.06%  last year suffered a data breach in which thieves stole 40 million payment-card numbers and the personal information of 70 million shoppers. Criminals recently have stolen card data from consumers who used plastic at Asian bistro chain P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc. and a string of grocery stores that operate as Albertsons, Acme and Jewel-Osco.
Target suffered a breach in 2013. Getty Images
All told, fraud losses on existing bank accounts and credit-card accounts rose 45% in 2013 to $16 billion, according to Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, a consulting firm that is a unit of Greenwich Associates LLC.
Separately, merchants already are installing new terminals at cash registers to accept cards embedded with computer chips that are more secure than traditional plastic cards with magnetic strips.
Financial institutions are expected to issue 575 million of those cards by the end of next year, reducing the ability for hackers to create counterfeit cards if they break into a merchant's computer system.
But as transactions become more secure in physical stores, there is concern thieves will migrate to online transactions, as they did in countries that have already switched to chip cards.
"Anything we can do at this point that speeds the process of getting the card data off the merchant system is a positive," said Julie Conroy, a research director at Aite Group, a card industry consulting firm.
In the U.S., the rate of online fraud is rising as more consumers shop online. It represents 16% of U.S. card fraud, according to the Members Group, a Des Moines, Iowa, company that provides card processing and other payment services to credit unions and community banks.
In the tokenization process, the merchant can conduct a normal transaction without seeing or storing the customer's account number, expiration date or other information contained on a card. The actual card data is stored by the card issuer or processor in a "virtual vault."
Although it has a similar name, the latest push is different from programs launched by some banks about a decade ago in which they issued physical security tokens to customers for use in online transactions.
Card industry executives said tokenization is particularly useful for merchants who store account information for recurring transactions, such as a monthly gym membership.
"We continue to hear from retailers that they don't want to be in the security business, that they want to get the card data out of their environment," said Craig Hoffman, a lawyer at BakerHostetler LLP in Cincinnati who advises merchants on data breach issues.
Unlike other security measures that involve new cards for consumers and updated payment hardware for merchants, the token process takes place only between the merchant and the card processor or issuer. Consumers are unaware that the merchant is receiving a unique number for a transaction instead of the card information.
The industry's effort "isn't solely about putting chips on cards. It's about making sure the underlying systems can make all of these transactions more secure," said Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard.
Industry executives said the new process usually adds a penny or two of cost for merchants each time a token is generated for a transaction.
Many merchants are hesitant to discuss security measures.
Dustee Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Target, said the retailer isn't using tokens, but "it is a topic that we, along with many other participants, are actively engaged in with the payments industry as a potential feature of future payment processing."

I met Professor Bitcorn at the MarketWatch event in NYC last month. I had a long conversation with him, and have since emailed with him a couple times. He spoke to me about how he finds the technology promising, but needs more regulation/safeguards volatility needs to go down, blah blah. I keep emailing him asking him why he has to be such a bearish douche when he says different things privately. He seems to be a supporter from a general standpoint, but then presents a totally different viewpoint in public forums. By the way, he owns Bitcoin and admitted it to the whole room at the event, including Barry Silbert who joked about that fact. Anyway, I'm going to send him another email after this. What would you like me to ask considering he actually responds? (please trolls and nonsense-speakers, do not waste your time or mine.)

I said it was an oversimplification, I didn't say it wasn't true. My point is that there are young teens who are badly influenced or who suffer and turn to drugs in a destructive manner, and understandably so. Said destructive manner is obviously not the case for all or even most drug users. I'm not against drugs, but I'm for providing treatment in the case that drug addicts need help. And I don't know if you've ever seen/worked with drug addicts before, but people in that state of mind are not necessarily in control of all their faculties, and fully able to make decisions about getting treatment. It's a difficult issue, but to say people should just be alone on this issue, without help from medical professionals is irresponsible in my mind.

Ok, let's talk in a few years when the tech reaches its maximum adoption rather than 5 years after its creation given that it's still in a nascent state. Your arguments rest on the fact that it won't grow substantially over the next few years, and that's short-sighted as user growth and business investment are increasing exponentially. Let's see if that 2.2 million transactions number still stands in 3-5 years.

I'm a huge bitcoiner but I do not think merchant adoption will be the thing to drive mass consumer adoption. When merchant adopts new payment methods (i.e. credit cards back in the day and now apple pay/Google wallet) there is still a clear incentive to the consumer in the form of credit or ease of use/convenience. Innovation and creating products and services which allow people to use bitcoin in ways they cannot use other payment methods or in ways that are superior to current options will drive adoption. Micropayments is one option. Cheap remittances is another. But there's a whole host of innovations to come, most of which we can't forsee yet.

I usually make it a rule not to waste my breath on trolls. However, the argument is not apples to apples. It's a bit overused at this point, but the Napster to BitTorrent comparison with egold/Liberty Dollars/etc to Bitcoin is more apt in my opinion. Bitcoin is not the first digital currency. That being said, I'm not naive as to think it's success is guaranteed or even likely. It's just a stupid point by that is lazy in my view, mainly because Bitcoin is not the first, second or third attempt at a digital currency.

I don't care too much about the price or long term gains. And I'm more than aware that Bitcoin is not a payment system. The endless possibilities course through my head for hours each day, and yet I have no programming ability, so I can only imagine what developers must be conjuring up. And like I said, I'm less interested in what Bitcoin will do in America (I'm American) and other developed countries than what it can do for the unbanked. I oppose those centralized measures wholeheartedly, and for this reason I don't use those services, but others don't agree with you, and I am not of the belief that we need a singular opinion here. To me, it seems pointless/antithetical to centralize a beautifully decentralized construct, but there are currently barriers to entry for the majority of the non-tech savy population out there.
What can I do to stop these things from happening aside from supporting the initiatives like yours that seek to follow an opposing trajectory? I'm doing just that, and I will protest in front of Circle's offices the day they make some nefarious plan known that might actually come to fruition. Perhaps I'm naive, but that is my position right now, I believe Bitcoin can have things like dark wallet and Circle coexisting with each other, though that is not a fixed view that won't possibly change over time. I watch every day and I am on the look out for those things that seek to undermine the decentralization, but as long as I have the opportunity to use the blockchain as it was "meant" to be used, I see no problems with what others do until they encroach on that territory.

And we're not talking about what was Bitcoin in 2009 or how it was conceived. We are talking about what is Bitcoin today from a political standpoint, and my point is that even if you see things that identify with anarcho-capitalism in this technology, that doesn't mean that other ideologies don't find aspects they identify with. I guess by that point Bitcoin isn't politically netural, but it also isn't exclusively anarcho-capitalist. My point is that it is open to varying perspectives, and also not ideological in one sense. Distributed systems of trust by consensus are not inherently exclusively anarcho-capitalist.

So in other words it's like setting up any method of receiving payment, but once it's been set up, it's cheaper, faster, and easier to use. Charities can sign up for free processing with BitPay or Coinbase, who will convert the next business day for free. That doesn't include Changetips they've already received, but Changetips might motivate them to sign up for these services. When your agenda is getting charities to utilize a payment system that allows them to keep a bigger cut of the donation, then I don't see a problem with pushing said agenda by giving money to good causes and content creators. 
EDIT: I also give to organizations in fiat, I'm not trying to deny good causes funds just because they don't accept bitcoin, but I think it's a worthwhile task. Agree to disagree.

Dollars can't travel across borders and be exchanged as cheaply. Bitcoin is huge for international transfers, particularly small amounts sent as remittances. People always say the average fee for Western Union/MoneyGram is around 10% which is already ridiculous, but if you send $50 or less, you can pay upwards of 25% (or you just would not do the transaction at all). Bitcoin allows for international transfers of small denominations at little to no fees. Nothing can compete with Bitcoin in that space right now as far as I know.

I said addicts, totally different from drug use which I condone wholeheartedly. Choice is fundamentally important and at the heart of personal freedom, and my point is drug addicts don't have the wherewithal to choose if sufficiently addicted. Go talk to former drug addicts, they'll tell you it's a sickness they couldn't control. Furthermore your gun comment speaks to the possibility that you just spew whatever rhetoric you've heard countless times and automatically label people with opposing views as evil statists. I totally disagree with the current approach but I think saying that a drug addict should have the right to choose to take drugs is fundamentally ignorant in that addicts aren't exercising choice.  That was my point. I'm not advocating that I should take control of how you choose to live your life but rather that it's bullshit to say a drug addict is choosing anything and the alternative of absolute anarchy is the definitive answer to our society's flaws. And it's funny because you're accusing me of trying to prescribe how the world should function yet you yourself are actively prescribing a way the world should be. Not everyone agrees with your philosophy and thus to achieve your utopia you'd be overriding some peoples wishes in the process yourself. To have an opinion as to how society should function necessarily means you're implying you know what's best.

A lot of people who receive remittances in Africa, Southeast Asia, etc. do not have smart phones, laptops, and consistent internet access. If companies like Circle allow sms-capabilities, that would be great. I'd say that's doubtful, though, because they obviously care more about making money by catering to westerners than they do to solving the remittance problem. I'd love to see a big player like Circle or Coinbase try to make an SMS-based wallet/service.

@_date: 2014-07-07 20:47:36
This is a liquidity issue that would be solved if adoption increases--either Bitcoin will catch on or it won't so this is really a short-term issue imo. But in case you're curious, I am writing an article on the story that was detailed in the fantastic "Bitcoin in Uganda" documentary that Bitcoinfilm.org created: 
I've spoken to Ronald, featured in the video, for example, and he managed to find people in Uganda who bought his bitcoins ranging from the market price to a 4% markup. He is receiving small amounts of money and he absolutely would be paying a $10 fee on $100 transfer, so there's tangible proof right there.  
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:00:01

You are assuming I merely publicize this charity on Bitcoin forums and no where else.

We just raised tons of money for Dorian Nakamoto, Sean's Outpost's lifeblood exists largely because of this reddit, I'm hoping that it will be more than a few donations, but worst case, isn't a few additional dollars/Bitcoins worth it versus nothing if I hadn't said anything?

If not at the protocol level, then we need easier, more enticing ways to bring the majority of the hashing power to p2p pools. There doesn't need to be a centralized authority for mining--for the core development team, sure, there's no helping that, but decentralized mining is what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin to a large degree. If that doesn't happen, then I might as well go to a centralized bank that insures my money up to a certain point, has more of a "reputation" of reliability than GHash, and a proven track record. Fuck that. I want decentralized Bitcoin because decentralized systems with p2p efficiency and no central point of attack are markedly superior. That's why I'm here.

This. I'm no anarchist, believe me. I'm in favor of efficient systems. Bitcoin is self-regulating, and I trust crypto/math more than humans when it comes to certain aspects of society, particularly money transfer. I absolutely see the need for regulation, but it should use the cryptographic tools available, and the Foundation legitimately has no sway in terms of informing how Bitcoin progresses imo. So they are essentially a centralized system that does little good beyond paying Gavin (which I for one would donate to his salary if it was crowdfunded) and talking to regulators, and I have no clue how they conduct those conversations. I'd say they've done much more bad than good for Bitcoin so far from a PR standpoint.

I pretty much have the same opinion. I'm for legalization with a heavy emphasis on awareness and availability of free treatment centers for drugs. Easier said than done but a goal worth working toward in my opinion. With respect to sugar I think we need more education, but more importantly, we need to find a way to make healthy food cheaper. Lofty goals, but I think they're worth striving for.

What about showing a "rebittance" or global transfer in action. Maybe have a person in a non-Western country who needs money fast from a family member/friend in the Western world. Person A asks for a Western Union transfer, saying they need the money fast, hopefully they can get it in a few days. Person B says, "Days, how about minutes?" and sends some bitcoin to Person A. Obviously need more details, but just a basic idea. Remittance/global-reach should be highlighted. 
Thanks for volunteering!
Edit: Forgot to mention that of course you should mention the fees. Might even be better if it's a small transfer, under $50, so you can also show that transfers of that value are cost-efficient with BTC and not with Western Union/traditional money transmitters.

I didn't get the sense that he was saying that employer payroll adoption should precede merchant adoption, but maybe I missed that point. I got the sense that he was saying now that we have a decent level of merchant adoption, we need salaries to follow to cut down the barriers to entry for individuals to get a hold of bitcoin. We need both. I quite agree as most people's main aversion to acquiring bitcoin is the need to jump through hoops and pay fees to exchanges in order to do so. While I have no trouble with that, I imagine many people who haven't seen the benefits of Bitcoin will not buy any through existing methods. Just my two satoshis.

I was waiting for this reply. No doubt, but that doesn't change the fact that the statement that any perceived "design flaws" are set "in concrete" is incorrect. Even if it will not happen, the changes are possible. But, if a real design flaw threatened Bitcoin in a serious manner, and it was fixable, miners would be incentivized to accept the changes or it would mean their livelihood.

The regulators are going to regulate no matter what because they are ignorant and do not understand how Bitcoin works. Not to mention, Lawsky clearly thinks regulation is needed from NYDFS for everything on the planet. They understand a bit, but if you read the regulations, you must determine that Lawsky and his department are either woefully ignorant or attempting to hurt cryptocurrencies. Either way, they will do what they will do no matter what the community does.

question for you. I assume the answer is no, but considering all of the Tipping Tuesday action going on, I figure it's worth asking. I ask because I've been trying to persuade [Worldbuilders]( a fantastic charity that has raised $300,000 so far this year for Heifer International, to accept BTC donations. Say a charity does not currently accept Bitcoin, but then receives Changetips via Twitter and decides they want to start accepting bitcoin donations. Would BitPay provide payment processing for the tips received prior to the charity signing up with BitPay? 
I have been in touch with someone at Worldbuilders, and they are now accepting Changetip as of two weeks ago. They are interested in accepting btc donations, I told them to reach out to BitPay, but they are very understaffed and that sort of contact is probably low-priority for them as they have tons of giveaways to organize and ship. PM me if you would like the contact info of the person I've been speaking with.

It's more of a libertarian bias, not a pro-drugs-specific bias.

Again, get off your high horse and stop assuming based on my limited statements that you know my opinion on Silk Road and that I am a slave to the thinking of papa government. It just makes you sound like an ignorant ideologue. I don't think Silk Road was bad, in fact I agree with your statements on it, both the point about it providing a safer context to buy and sell drugs in, but also the point about addiction taking away the ability to choose. But, you also overly glorify Silk Road in my opinion, as well. My ex-girlfriend's friend died from using drugs he bought on Silk Road. Deaths and horrible occurrences came out of Silk Road as well, but largely on the whole, it was positive given that drugs are necessarily going to exist and be taken.


I am a critical thinker who doesn't regurgitate the garbage "I'm fed" and you sound really silly attempting to extrapolate my world view based on a paragraph I wrote. I am also not discussing the merits of Silk Road, but rather the fact that you can't start an exchange that you want to be seen as "legitimate" (bs word, but take it as you will) with VC money from notable investors (the Winklevoss') and also help launder money for an illegal marketplace and expect to get away with it. Again, I'm not saying this is necessarily what Charlie was aiming to do, but if he was, then he is not very bright for thinking he can get away with it. My apologies about taking this hypothetical further than it should probably be taken, but I personally take a cautious stance without knowing the full facts.


Did I say that Bitcoin was non-political? No I said it does NOT represent a SINGULAR viewpoint. Clearly you disagree, but to me, that difference only proves my point. And Dark Wallet, etc., is one product out there being developed versus a product like Circle which I wholeheartedly do not support, but again, shows that there are different views on how Bitcoin can and/or should progress. There is not a singular opinion on what Bitcoin should be, and what it means to the world. You seem to care more about the anarchistic and anonymous properties of it, which are great, but I tend to focus more on it being a source of empowerment to the unbanked when possible, a great means of doing remittances, etc.


Again, I never expressed any negative thoughts about Silk Road, you are assuming without much basis. I think Silk Road was good overall, but you can't both start an exchange you hope to become a top exchange in the space and expect to comply with regulation, and then try to launder money for an illegal marketplace. Again, I'm not saying that was Charlie's intention, but you seem to be arguing that that is an intelligent course of action, and I think you need to either do one or the other or you're going to get caught. And if you truly care about Bitcoin, and find yourself in that position, I think you should focus on purely facilitating buying and selling bitcoin for the masses, make your money off fees (as all the big exchanges do these days), and be content that you are profiting and building the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:43:40

I guess the plan is for Reddit to act as a Changetip-like centralized service for tipping? But that doesn't seem to make sense with a receiving address being listed in your profile.

On Saturday, at a family party, I sat around explaining Bitcoin and decentralization to a group of 6 of my mom's 60+ year old friends as my girlfriend listened on. My girlfriend is very open to Bitcoin and I talk to her about it often--naturally she found the audience and act hilarious. The ladies were actually quite receptive. I explained it from the perspective of the recent Sony hack being a product of centralized data storage and how decentralization comes into play. I almost didn't menton bitcoin...but then I couldn't help myself of course. 2 of the women in particular seemed quite intrigued. Small victories, eh?

A somewhat fair yet expected response. Roger says the same thing (not lumping the two of you together, just an observation).


Agreed. But when engineers say that a change you want to make in the interest of business is unsafe for Bitcoin, and could potentially compromise its core properties/values, then I think it becomes an engineers-only decision. We're not talking about a change with limited repercussions. We're talking life or death. That level of technical understanding regarding critical decisions is out of our respective ranges. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:37:09
Eric, would you let Jeff, Gavin, Peter, Rusty, Greg etc. have a large say in how Shapeshift is run from a business standpoint? No, because they are devs, not entrepreneurs. And that's rational. So why should you and a handful of other business owners have a large say in how software is updated when you're entrepreneurs, not devs? Everyone has their expertise. It's just hubris to think you know better than a legion of developers who have made this ecosystem so successful, and safely developed it in amazing ways. 
For the record, I know my analogy isn't perfect as some of the devs are also entrepreneurs and vice versa, but the larger point stands.

Exactly. u/justhereforthepuppy, since you're a new investor, and I imagine less comfortable than more experienced users, I would wait for the tool Trezor will likely create, as they did with the BCH fork. They will also likely provide a step by step tutorial to walk you through the process, as they did with BCH. I'll be honest and say it might still be a tiny bit tricky, the usability of these things isn't quite at total noob level yet, but Trezor does a great job and there will be plenty of people on reddit who can help w further instruction when the time comes

Get it off of Coinbase well in advance of the split (if one even happens, we'll see). Either buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger or use a web wallet like Electrum. If you don't, then Coinbase can decide to support one side of the split and not credit you the other forked coin. The wallets I mentioned will guarantee you get coins from both chains. Exchanges are a crap shoot and you should never store money on them long term. Good luck!

@_date: 2015-08-19 00:34:41
Thanks for the great explanation! I apologize but I should've been more specific. I'm on the subreddit daily so I was aware of everything you said. To be more specific I'm basically wondering about  I interpreted OP's post as saying Slush mined a block with BIP 101 implemented but doesn't it only come to fruition after January if there's at least 75pct support? My initial interpretation was that Slush mined a block larger than 1 MB but thats obviously not possible until after January pending other conditions. So in other words does this post mean that Slush just mined a block w the XT and that BIP 101 is implemented already but the increased blocksize is still up in the air? So if no 75 pct support comes then BIP 101 essentially is an empty new rule that changes nothing correct? 
EDIT: In other words I think I answered my own question with your help, and apologies for overcomplicating. But I guess I thought that the way the BIP was designed it would only be implemented if there was a 75% acceptance of it after January 2016. But I guess I'm misinterpreting how BIPs work so basically the BIP is already implemented, but it does nothing if 75% isn't achieved starting from January on? It's just a BIP that does nothing if it's not "activated" yes?

There are enough people in this sub who disagree with that statement. Such censorship is unacceptable.

I think you've been a great mod, but that response seems unlike you. People should be allowed to put out calls to test code that relates to bitcoin even if you and other mods disagree with the approach. I say that as someone who doesn't have the necessary foundation to have a meaningful opinion on the block size debate so I don't side with XT.

The most important point IMO, which no one mentioned yet, is that the Bitcoin core devs have guided a multibillion dollar system wisely over years now vs an unproven dev team at BCH which already made a huge fuckup with the original EDA.

To be honest, if you never thought of it, that means you should probably do a lot more research. Unless you have access to a cheap or free source of electricity, it's likely not worth it.
There are a lot of overeager people in this sub, many newer to bitcoin than others, who will tell you some things are guaranteed (price going up, price going down, btc pullback will translate into an alt boom, etc.) and I would be wary of those opinions as they're largely uninformed. The best bet is to buy some bitcoin, an amount you could comfortably afford to lose, and then sit on it for the next decade without letting short term fluctuations affect you. 
Been doing that since 2013 and it's worked pretty well.

Disclaimer: I'm not terribly informed on this subject, but I saw someone bring this point up on Twitter and it seems valid: the total market cap for Tether is currently $645 million and BTC's market cap is $131.5 billion. That means that even if all USDT flowed into Bitcoin, Tether would only comprise 0.5% of the total BTC market cap. That's not an earth-shattering amount. So why worry? Am I missing something?

Block propagation in BTC had been very consistent for 8 years before bcash came along. Not sure what “bug” you’re referring to. Maybe educate yourself a bit more before commenting on things you don’t seem to understand well.

The NYT certainly has issues, and I'm no fan of Krugman. They didn't report on the Bush wire taps at the White House's request, until they found out the story was going to be announced in a book, so they finally released the info only to beat the book to market, which is incredibly pathetic. But to say the paper has a liberty-opposing agenda is straying into tin foil hat territory.

If only as much effort and attention was being given to helping women who are involuntarily involved in the sex trafficking trade, forced against their will. 
Cue the libertarian downvotes and rants. 
EDIT: You can downvote in ignorance or you can educate yourselves. 
Bitcoin is amazing, but do we want to enable sex traffickers with it? As much as you hope bitcoin will help liberate the women who are not being forced into the profession it's probably more likely to enable the sex traffickers posting ads and exploiting women.

That was true in the few decades after the Revolutionary war when the 2nd amendment was still relevant because militias formed that actually had the power to challenge the military. This is the constant argument of the pro-gun side, but I don't see how a group of citizens with shotguns are going to band together ever to create a reasonable challenge to government. The world has evolved since the 18th and 19th centuries, as have the ways of challenging government.

I doubted BTC-e for 2-3 years. I don't doubt them any longer. If I had to bet, I'd say they'll come back fine. But, as always, that doesn't negate the following: DO NOT LEAVE YOUR COINS ON EXCHANGES OR THEY'RE NOT REALLY YOUR COINS.

Can someone point out a source that says this is conclusively a private blockchain?


That leads me to believe it's using colored coins on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.

I disagree, but even so, there's a vast difference between paycoin and bitcoin--one is a clear scam and the other is an incredible innovation. Regardless there are solid debates going on in this sub reddit to cut through the circle jerk nature...and circle jerk threads are often fun and entertaining.

Though I see your point, and while there's no denying that is true of many degrees/schools, I did not personally have that experience in any level of schooling through college. I learned a lot and I think such a blanket statement does more harm than good.

I thought this for years. Your parents and grandparents are likely fucked, as you said, and certainly a lot of progress needs to be made for easy safe storage. But for a vaguely tech savvy person, buy a trezor or ledger, and it's incredibly intuitive and easy. Don't wait around until an exchange goes belly up and you're screwed. 
EDIT: I should add, only if the cost of a trezor or ledger hardware wallet is worth it for you relative to how much btc you own.

No doubt, and I agree with everything you said. But Peter Thiel, unlike you, did not give any explanation for his statement. When stated as a blanket statement that the payment system is flawed, it means nothing to people who are laymen on the topic of bitcoin. He should do a better job explaining what he means. To me, I interpreted it as him questioning the efficacy of the transaction system, yet I've never had a single issue initiating a btc transaction. Your explanation is probably more to his point, but he was quite vague.

I respectfully disagree. I could do the same thing with Venmo or Chase Quickpay. The amazing qualities of bitcoin go way beyond the ease of paying friends for dinner. How about paying for their dinner from a bitcoin-accepting merchant from the other side of the world, instantaneously? Or even something cheap, less than $5, to show how it is a cost-effective payment method for small transactions. But the explaining, patiently, over time, persistently yet respectfully, leads to talk of potential Bitcoin 2.0 innovations or even the cost-saving effects of bitcoin on 1.0 things like remittances. Explaining takes time but if you catch someone's interest, it goes a long way.

I feel like it’s more complicated than that. He’s a sociopath. I don’t think his mind is a rational place that thinks in those terms. I think it’s more an egomaniacal faith in his own bs more than that he believes others are gullible. But who knows.
