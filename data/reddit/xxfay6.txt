Coinbase was certainly not instant with bank account. Last time I checked it took almost a whole week to clear.

Mexican here, our ATMs have a daily $5000 MXN limit and regularly are stuffed with $500 MXN notes, although they go as low as $50 MXN. Yet a $1000 bill is considerably uncommon to see since you almost never need to use that much, so $500 is the norm, practically equivalent to a $50 USD bill although actually worth around $40.

That explains it. I was wondering myself "Hey, when did we get a fourth airline" and then saw it was a small one.
Well, it's not like I've been to the inside of the local airport in a while.
@_date: 2014-12-19 22:56:17
Wow, that's cheaper than the ATM by ~$200 MXN, closer (ATM is a 15 minute walk, OXXO is across the street) and impressive on it's own.

It's shiny so people want it (that was the entire premise of money before reserve banking). Breaking it up is easy, and prices would have to be reconverted to gold if one were to restore a gold-based economy. Exactly the same thing with Bitcoin, prices would have to be defined, but try and get your grandma to set prices for her cake shop without making her head implode.
And while you can also not carry tons of gold like nothing happened, you can carry a standard amount of what's considered safe without any problem.
Also, gold is tangible while Bitcoin is not. This means gold would be accepted *anywhere* and has a guarantee that it will not disappear suddenly. Bitcoin has the blockchain, it's the only guarantee that it works which so far it has done. If it has a fork, a delay, an intentional 51% attack, etc. it dissolves.
Also the simple fact that it requires access to the blockchain means that an internet or elec drop can cripple the *entire* economy. My city had one less than 15 years ago and while the banks had hiccups and such, everyone could still just go and buy food using cash, so we held off for a day or two without much incident. Imagine being unable to do that, chaos would ensure extremely quickly (exactly like currently Greece is experiencing, yet they know it's not actually returning nationwide, so even worse).

While it can never reach the status of official coin (like recently AuroraCoin tried) it is possible for it to see it a lot more publicly, yet it still can't be used to do simple stuff like going out and rent a car or something.  
  
Truth is, pretty sure checks are more widely accepted than bitcoin, and it's not going to change anytime soon.

You've got it easy, in my case it is:
Walk 10 mins. to an ATM with a 6% fee.
Or wait 4 days on the internet. (At least Coinbase doesn't need SSN)

Out of curiosity, are you doing this over here?

I agree. The problem lies with then not actually fulfilling their promises and underdelivering. This would only work if the internet were stable.

That's why I said "What if?", I know this isn't what they're doing but something I came up with.
Also, Verizon does this, it hadn't worked out that well for them.

That's why it's rediquette, it's not really a rule and more of a social norm.
It is enforced pretty thoroughly, sometimes a bit too much, but it's not really official.

Am I the only one here that would use these?
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:32:30
Yep, there's one by Banamex/Inbursa that's directly tied to the Telcel network (biggest MX carrier), and there's the one being used by Bancomer that's just a code redemption system.
Haven't tried them, they're rather new but have prompted tons of old ATMs to be reconditioned not to look like from the 90s.
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:29:48
Perhaps you could try and go to the Bitcoin ATM here in BIT Center, deposit some and then walk over to the Bancomer across the street to try and redeem them.

Now sure how many DMCA bots are crawling ~~Google~~ Facebook, but it's still a possibility it was just a bot, right?
Also, Does Facebook actually give DMCA strikes ala YouTube? IIRC that was a YT system, not part of the law.
@_date: 2014-11-26 03:06:20
What matters is the intention, and while they haven't shown interest in fixing it, it might've not been it's original purpose.
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:35:02
With that I meant use it as a coin, I don't plan to go out of my way to use bitcoin  
  
also, even if the thing I just bought with bitcoin was almost immediately transferred to fiat, it is still counting towards a positive statistic thay may allow future places to actually use and manage bitcoin

16 yr. old living close to the US, coinbase only required a bank account, while I don't remember if it had to be an US account (which I ended up using) they just asked for a bank account and a phone for 2factor (+52 worked). No extra verification, if you can use PayPal you can use Coinbase too.
@_date: 2014-05-24 05:25:00
PayPal requires you to be 18?

@_date: 2014-03-31 03:42:48
The 2 main orders of magnitude are:
* Reached the tech mainstream
* US sort-of considers it money
That means there's 2 more foreseeable bumps:
* Wall Street and such jump in (very likely).
* Reaches general public mainstream (doubtful).
Pretty sure we have at least 1 jump ahead, because it does look like it's going to become traded like stocks.
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:15:50
Not exactly close nearby, but close enough.
Did it work?

Recent 600 here, I have been really tempted to sell it but I simply cannot see myself doing that. I really want it to become big and be able to use it properly (only thing right now I can use: HumbleBundle).  
  
Nice inspiration is the new ATM's on my city, haven't gone there but sure as hell gonna use them.

Yes, I know about that, it's just that I'm not sure if getting a DMCA on Facebook is as bad or worse than YouTube.
Since YouTube has the strikes system, nowadays a DMCA is like throwing a huge FUCK YOU at your account since it's only fully removable by court. That's why they created their own strikes system that's not DMCA that doesn't get you a penalty outright, but DMCA does.
I know the strikes system is 100% a YouTube thing, so I don't know if facebook has it as hard as YT if hit with one, or if they don't have to because their volume is much lower.

p2pool.org is a real node, the only thing people are pissed off is that it has a 2% fee.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:10:19
I wonder, what if this extra "fast lane" is used to add speed only on top of the already paid bandwidth only for the sponsored site?
This could make a very cheap internet service viable for people that just want to Facebook, Netflix, etc. while maintaining the (supposed) quality of service for better-tiers. Netflix adds some ads for the extra speed and makes it opt-out.

The operator shares access to p2pool as an easily accessable serve that works like any other stratum pool. This helps if people are too lazy to setup a full p2p node / instance which requires a bit more configuration than just stratum.

I think is more about the precedent of being forced to give up their signature keys or make them easily accesible than being able to use them at all.

Can't see the "Trump farts" post but your point still stands. Holy shit this might be one of the biggest stories to break since the start of the year and yet all stuck in the same old Trump and Russia articles that don't really bring anything new to the table other than filler.

It would be a fork, not an alternative blockchain. That's the difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin Classic.

Point is they have no responsibility to do so, unlike PayPal's responsibility to account for the money (if not for you, for the government).

I recently got a 50% return after dropping from 100% to 0% with the ETH mining crash, and cashed out. Personally, the waters have been a bit too rough as of late and I may have to use the money sooner than later so I think I can swallow any inactivity losses.

Or set up priority correctly.
When using AMD OverDrive I set it up at high priority during testing, It only gave me 2 to 5 seconds each time it upped the multiplier to try and so it.

Wasn't supposed to be a miner, but meh running in the background
(APU) is an A8 3570K
(GPU) is an 6670
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:27:09
It was just a random problem may I imagine with GUIMiner, the GPU is just a 6670 (originally planned for budget gaming, but since not all games support it I decided to mine with it while I reddit and such just for fun), so the speeds shown are ok.
[Currently, it works pretty much OK]( CPU was pretty active but when there's no CPU tasks the APU makes only a bit more heat than idle.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:13:07
So, is it worth it?
@_date: 2013-04-20 07:31:23
With GPU running close to double the speed of the APU, the GPU only has resolved 2 shares
