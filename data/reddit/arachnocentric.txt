So the value can rise, but aren't we talking about price?  That feels a bit strange to me - the s-curve shows up in a chart of value, which doesn't actually have a price on it and isn't even something measurable.  But you do agree that some part of the price isn't from adoption (not the only factor, in your words).  How can you tell the difference between a fluctuation and an actual move then?  
If every rally is increased adoption and every dip is just random fluctuation, to me that's just dismissing points that don't fit with the S-curve theory. My "sketchy logic" detector lights up when I hear that!

Many of them did and have sold since they thought the time was right.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:12:11
So many hodlers selling today. Panic could get worse in the short-term. It's a really, really bad sign when panic hits the early adopters. The worst case scenario IMO is falling to around 8000 - but it could be really fast if panic spreads too much. After that there's other points of resistance but most are a long way down. But this is kinda expected given the huge rally last year.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:27:33
My point still stands IMO. Adoption of anything has never resulted in the price of the underlying asset following closely with adoption. The S-curve shows up in some equities (WalMart is probably the "cleanest" one -
  but only ones that are growing quickly with earnings also growing to back up the price.  
The price of Bitcoin (or any other crypto) isn't where it is because of adoption, but rather whatever people will pay on the open market.  Some food for thought - if the price does what you say, aren't you concerned that adoption has fallen rapidly and hasn't recovered yet?  I know you aren't saying that explicitly, but that's the only conclusion if the price is linked to adoption and the price is down 45% from the ATH.

You're also describing stock exchanges wrt ETFs.  You aren't seeing what you call "manipulation". You're seeing what happens when big money is either trading using crypto ETFs or have their own in-house algorithmic platforms that buy/sell all currencies at once to mitigate risk.  This is definitely happening but it's nothing new. For example, when Coca Cola and Pepsi are up, you can be pretty sure Dr. Pepper Snapple is as well. People buy funds that hold tons of different stocks within the same sector.

Bitcoin's been trading on emotion for awhile now, and coupled with a recent downturn it creates an unstable market. This isn't unique to bitcoin - it applies to anything that rises this quickly. Crashes can be triggered by the dinkiest things. The problem isn't the news, but rather the market itself.

He makes it sound like nefarious networks of bots manipulating prices but it's not really like that. "Whales" = the people that are actually influencing the price.

Bots will always be better than humans at trading short-term because they make faster decisions.

Your bubble analysis is a bit disjointed. It's better to see it as 1 large bubble if you want to see a bubble. The last spikes and dips were inflationary phases. The most recent one may also be - or it may be the top. That's how bubbles look - the growth looks pretty much like the top and you can't tell until after the fact. So you may be 100% right. Or you could be getting in at the top. Just only invest what you can stand to lose and you'll be golden.
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:42:12
I have no idea. But it seems strange to me that so many people would be completely confident that the China news is meaningless, noise, and fud; yet still believe that it's the reason for the drop.  That would imply that only people here know the true story, since if the fud *is* the reason then clearly almost everyone else believes it otherwise the price wouldn't be going down.  And that's just too insane a concept for me - that people who have only read articles and blog posts about Bitcoin are the ones that have the 100% true version of reality.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:42:00

The blowoff started at 8000 and really ramped up at 10000. Since we've broken the latter, the former is almost inevitable. After that we'll get a bounce followed by more steady declines to the next resistance level, between 6000 and 7000.  After that, who knows - the pattern of decline+rebound can go on for a long time or it can stop and use that resistance level as a floor, and it's impossible to predict which will happen. There are examples of times when it went on for waay longer than people thought it would, so any price predictions would just be wild guesses.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:31:04

Coupled with low Weekend volume I think you can probably infer some things about who is buying and who is selling lately.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:21:15
If this is a bubble, it'll follow a pattern.
Concern first, then worry, then denial + anger, then fear - and it'll hit pretty much everyone simultaneously.  Then panic and capitulation (selling), along with more anger directed at everyone else.  And in the end? All of the people that got trapped will claim that they knew it was a bubble all along. It is extremely predictable, again - if it's a bubble
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:08:09
That's right. But I'm not thinking of supply and demand - only looking at charts and resistance points.  This pattern is not a new one, so I'm using some historical knowledge to make predictions. Still, they are just predictions!

I get where you're coming from, especially having experienced Enron second-hand (a good story for not for this place!).  The potential for malfeasance here is large. But I still have the same response for you as the last poster to take the same stance. Because it's possible or easy doesn't mean that it's happening. It's not proof, basically. I agree that it does happen though, so maybe I'm just being pedantic. I also don't have proof.
What I did spell out though is a reasonable cause for price correlation. As it stands, I think it's a better explanation than "Some other things must be happening but I don't know what, but I know it's manipulation" due to how vague the latter stance is.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:11:57
That's true. Can you say the same of rises? Can they also be pumps or buying frenzies that aren't connected to adoption?  I don't understand how people can conclude that every rise is warranted, but every drop is noise/fake news.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:34:15
Remember that this technical analysis stuff is kinda voodoo, but in this case I'd say no. At least, not yet - I see 3 bottoms in that chart around the same level, but no breakout. I'd want to see one in the near future before I'd feel confident.  What's more obvious is a double-top, which I'm sure you know can be a bad signal.  But we're [stuck in this trend]( lately. It'll break soon, and while I have some suspicions as to how and when, nothing is certain.

Hence the "for fun" point. Walmart did what it did because of extremely rapid growth that slowly tapered off - but was still growing. When the price flatlined it wasn't the end of the growth - it was just that as earnings rose, growth rate fell - so the P/E ratio came down but was offset by real earnings. Pfizer didn't do that - Viagra made them rich, but earnings growth stopped faster than it did for Walmart. So the price dove - the premium due to high growth wasn't offset by still-growing earnings. Enron was Walmart's opposite - earnings growth stopped, but there was literally no real profit underneath, so the price went where it deserved to be.
Bitcoin doesn't have earnings, it's a different asset class. So the price is more a reflection of whatever people will pay. It's almost impossible to use traditional metrics to justify its price.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:48:50

No one knows where a bottom is, but from a technical pov I agree. Bitcoin can surprise you though.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:03:26
They didn't actually undersell it - it was a market order. So it filled from the top (market price) all the way down to where the order was totally filled.  The "end" price is just the lowest/last one, you don't see the rest aside from looking at order history.  Market orders are pretty rare though, they only happen during volatile times - like when panicking :(

This is risky with a volatile asset like Bitcoin. Wild swings happen with Bitcoin much faster than with stocks or any traditional investment.  By zooming too far out you lose granularity.  The candlestick chart is a culprit as well, showing intra-day movements with a very skinny line rather than a bar, causing it to me ignored more often than not.  The price simply moves too quickly for the chart to be an accurate representation of the price.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:35:59

I'm not. People that claim that the price always tracks adoption *should* conclude that if they are being honest with themselves.  
Price goes up: "It's not a bubble, it's an S-curve because adoption is rising it brings the price with it".
Price goes down: ?  
If price tracks adoption and price is down, adoption is down. I don't believe that myself of course! Price and adoption aren't linked like people believe.

Why are bitcoin futures prices linked with bitcoin prices? That's the whole point. Futures don't exist in a vacuum, they represent what people value bitcoin at.  So selling in 1 doesn't cause the other. Selling in both is happening for the same reasons.

I follow what you're saying, and it seems to make at least some sense. From my point of view, you're still ignoring the price movements that don't fit with your position on Bitcoin.  And it still feels to me like any big increases are never questioned. Nobody steps in and says: "Man, the price rose 20% overnight! Maybe this is a temporary pump?". Like a correction in reverse.  Yet every drop is questioned, discounted, or completely ignored.  I believe that confirmation bias is clouding judgment.

Yes, that's one way to reduce anxiety and stress.  But you couldn't do it "collectively" since every person is different.  I'd even say that some people are doing this already. But the people doing it are framing the issue differently.  To them, suddenly price does not matter - it's all about intangible value. Value is what *really* counts, and value isn't dipping.
It's sketchy logic though, since one of the big arguments supporting Bitcoin's booming price was that it's linked directly to adoption and value creation.  But when the price goes down the link is completely disregarded.

When a price falls under high volume and rises under low volume but not all the way back, it's a sign that the bounce won't last.  The low volume indicates that the bounce was more caused by a lack of selling than an influx of buying.

GDAX is my go to for real-time chart watching. I'd expect volume to fluctuate like that during slower times. During fast times, all exchanges should have strong volume. I don't know what the low volume means though (for GDAX that is). In general low volume can be taken at face value - not many people want to buy at this price and not many want to sell either.  Bitcoin is so new that there can be so many reasons for that being the case, so I can't speculate.
I just know that when this low-volume pattern breaks it tends to happen very abruptly and leads to wild swings. Last time we hovered at 14K and suddenly found ourselves at 9K for a short time. That's what I don't like - the instability.  It feels stable but it's almost surely temporary.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:42:21
Very temporarily, not that it doesn't count for that reason, but the amount that actually traded at 12,750 was a fraction of a coin.  And these charts are just guides. Technical analysis is for the most part guesswork and finding patterns after the fact.

Reference:  - 6 month chart
Takeaway: Exponential growth eventually stops - but what happens afterward can vary, and you can't infer anything from the prior price movement.  Sometimes the asset holds for awhile, sometimes it sells off and recovers, sometimes it just sells off.  Accelerated downward movement after a spike is extremely difficult to predict and time.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:02:57
I remember a 25% drop intra-day (but it recovered) on December 22.

Neither I nor anyone else can prove you incorrect, but I think you should know some history. When something always goes up and always recovers from dips, it looks like it'll do it forever. Historically, 0% of these things have actually done it forever. 100% of them had many supporters that believed they would, however.

I have a great investment opportunity for you! Give me 100 bucks today and I guarantee 150 back in 12 months! So I get tons of investors, say 100.  I collect $10000. After 12 months I send you all statements saying you're up 50%.
Want to cash out? Ok, but isn't another 50% gain more exciting? That's $225 after another year!  Most people agree.  The ones that just want cash? Cool, I have $10k to give out!
By the way, I didn't actually invest the money, I just spent some on a new TV.  All I'm doing is paying out new investor money to earlier investors. As long as I can get people to hold and I can attract new investors with more promises of gains I can keep this up.

It seems to me that you just implied it now. Any increases are because of adoption, but short-term fluctuations have have nothing to do with adoption but instead are caused by tons of temporary things.  I think it comes down to your belief that the S-curve exists and is being followed. As such, dips in the curve are by definition temporary. I don't hold that belief, so for me the dips aren't easy to dismiss. 
Going back to my prior question - what would it look like if adoption actually did crash and the price fell with it? Would it *look* different than a short-term fluctuation? If not, then it doesn't seem possible to change any minds - every bit of evidence will be written off as blips on the radar.

Double bottoms always count IMO, but you need to read it correctly or you'll get burned. What you want to see is 2 bottoms, the second one higher than the first (think of a 'W' leaning to the left a bit), strong volume off the lows, and a rally after the second bottom that gets the price above where the 'W' started.

Adding to this, when you have something that has risen this much, news has to remain good. The tiniest bad news can trigger a selloff. And it's not the details in the news that matters - just that it's bad.  The market is primed for large declines, all it needs is a trigger.

If it's a bubble then the capitulation takes longer than most people expect and there will be many false bottoms along the way.  Once popped there's no going back until the bad blood is all gone.  It might take a few years.

You normally get symmetry in the rises and falls - a steady rise, then a blowoff (started around 10K and doubled) and lots of choppy action for a bit, then the blowoff happens in reverse. After that, the decline pauses and when it resumes it's slower - like the rise from 6K to 8K to 10K.  I expect the full capitulation to take longer than a few months. My source is... every other bubble out there.

It's no different than daytrading penny stocks in terms of the wild price movement. And the price movement is wild for the same reason - there are lulls during the days in which almost no buying or selling is happening. When they stop, buyers or sellers tend to flood the market before the other can get back in.  You need alerts sent to your phone if you want to daytrade this stuff.  Otherwise you'll miss most of the short-term opportunities.
To answer your questions, you can't. You live sick. You are up and down like a schizophrenic who is *sometimes* off his meds.  That's the life of a day trader.

The actors that move the price are the ones with big money - banks, hedge funds, etc.  They like to diversify - so they buy and sell everything at once.  This selloff isn't a Bitcoin selloff, it's big money dumping crypto across the board.  
The same effect is visible in the stock market with sector ETFs. These things are tiny pieces of many different companies that are all in the same sector. Example: Coca Cola, Pepsi, Doctor Pepper Snapple.  When people buy or sell the ETF, the administrator of the ETF will buy or sell the underlying stocks, so they all move together.

It's more that the thing rose 1000%+ in a year, spiked to 20K, then has gone back down to 10K almost as fast as it rose. That's what bubbles do. It's exactly what they look like. And it's possible that this isn't one, but it currently fits the pattern of one pretty darned well.

@_date: 2018-01-30 18:14:02
Probably, but without seeing it I can't say for sure. But let me give an example of what it might be (numbers made up):
Bids (people wanting to buy): 100, 99, 98, 97, 96.
Asks (people wanting to sell): 101, 102, 103, 104, 105.
Current price: 100~. 
I come in and place a large market sell order: It consumes the 99s, 98s, and 97s, pushing the price to 97. For a split second, the order book looks weird - the highest bid will be 96 but the lowest ask will still be 101 (this is the "spread" - higher numbers mean more volatility). If 1 person comes in and buys 0.000001 coins at the market price, it'll get filled at 101 and the "last price" will be 101. Then the order book will fill out - so it's a temporary "blip".

You are correct IMO - this pattern happens, and throughout history every time it does the price becomes a momentum thing. BTC rallies, news reports it, people get excited and buy.  BTC falls, news reports it, and suddenly people want out.  Media causes a feedback loop. And it will eventually end, like you said - after all of the negativity has been purged.  History tells us that part takes longer than we'd expect. But once people finally capitulate and are afraid of Bitcoin, that's when a floor will form and fundamentals rather than mania will take over again.

Many smaller walls = time for buyers to get back in as the price falls, mitigating wild swings. But one giant wall? It'll take so much momentum to get over it, which could spill over - You don't get little breaks for buyers to reenter, so the price could nosedive really really fast. 
Just worth looking out for, I have no idea if it'll even get close to being filled any time soon.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:44:13
It looks that way but you're misreading it a bit. (This is from GDAX, so it could be different from what you're seeing). At that level there just aren't any buyers. Buying stops, sellers bring the price down, and repeat. Suppression would look like active sellers stepping in at that level.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:05:22
That wasn't my point at all. Why is the price down? You say noise, but how can you distinguish that from 'not noise'? If the price rises due to adoption, what else can result in a lower price other than less adoption?
If you have a theory and every example that confirms it is "proof", but every example that refutes it is "noise", then there's a fundamental problem with the theory.

@_date: 2018-01-11 22:20:03
I find this logic dubious. Why is adoption plummeting? Why are all of these people that bought into the Bitcoin revolution abandoning it?
That's not my logic - that's the S-curve, adoption logic. The price is down 33% from the ATH, so it stands to reason that adoption has gone negative.

This analysis is solid! But it's analysis of a parabolic asset, which is fraught with peril. To be very specific - gains like this have a pattern. They continue - every time you can do what OP did here and it works out to be a good prediction of the next leg. Eventually the pattern breaks, the analysis fails, and the asset tumbles. That's the downside of expecting endless exponential growth. The one time that it stops tends to undo years of growth.
So just be careful and don't have all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:59:19
I get the long-term concept, but I think that you risk completely missing a pattern that lasts significantly less time than the scales that you're looking at.  And the psychology is what's moving the price - so I think longs and short alike should care.  But that's personal opinion there.

Once BTC stabilizes the money dries up over there and the price tanks.

Look at a 3-year chart, and it's nothing but gains. Consider that many here are new investors. So all they've seen are rallies. It makes sense (to me at least) how they'd interpret the price in the context of what they know - a temporary dip which will inevitably turn into a rally.

And in 2010/2011, right? Both times it spiked and then fell 80%.  There's certainly no reason that something can't go through multiple bubbles. As long as you have excited people investing in droves it can happen.  It's just that this one is so much bigger because it's everyone buying now.  The first one was geeks and nerds buying. The second was techies who work in the IT field and some institutional investors. This time it's... people watching Big Bang and buying their Trezor from Walmart. When something hits the public, that's when *real* bubbles can take shape.  Sadly those same people will flee in droves, panicking if something goes wrong.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:56
That's just what happens when a large market order goes through during a "thin" market.  By thin, I mean there's not a ton sitting in the order book.  If you see a high bid at 18000, then between there and 17000 there are only bids for 100 coins in the book, it only takes a sale of 100 coins to drop the price $1000.  
Note that 100 coins weren't sold for $17000 - instead, fractions were sold for various values from 18K down to 17K.  In general, larger markets (the NYSE for example) doesn't get impacted by moves like this.  That's because there are so many orders out there, eating through $1000 takes TONS of money.  But for Bitcoin, the market is small enough for that to happen.
Note that the price often comes spiking back afterward - that's for a similar reason. The price falls so fast that people can't get sell orders into the book fast enough. So when a buy order for a large number of coins does hit, it eats through the red and we jump.
Finally, almost all trades are limit orders.  You only see tons of large market orders (Saying "I want to sell or buy NOW regardless of the price!") during 2 times - frenzy, and panic.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:54:56

Yeah, a longer-term exponential growth trend has existed pretty much since 2011. That kind of growth I like to see. The short term exponential growth spikes along the way are a bit different, I don't trust these kinds of rapid rallies (as you could probably tell!).
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:49:11
That works in reverse too? Because this drop came right after a spike.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:26
I don't know about what happens afterward. Hindsight will tell us in the end, but for now we're still in a pattern of monstrous increases, rapid and sharp declines, then bouncing back to where we were at before the drop. 
If we fall, then bounce back above the last high (13400ish) then there's more room to run. The next "leg" in this increase from a charting pov is like... 18500.  If the bounce fails to get back to 13400, then we'd be in a new pattern and there's just no telling what would happen next. Sorry to sound so vague, but that's investing for you!
Edit: Even in the event of a BIG crash, I do think that a recovery to the same position or higher would still happen. It would just take longer.

This place remind you of t_d too?  Dissent and you're a shill and get shouted down.  Everyone is attacking them. If you use any other coin you're a troll trying to bring down Bitcoin.
But at the same time: "Bitcoin is antifragile! It can't be defeated!"
And then again, at the same time: "We must attack these trolls or they'll defeat us!"
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:25:10
I think there's still lots of room to run.  Mathematics ensure that it can't last forever, but there's lots of investment money sitting on the sidelines, and now easy access to debt to buy BTC is having an impact.  That last part is pretty key, since it tends to cause a collapse *very* quickly once people start going underwater.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:40
It's hard to move money from fiat to BTC.  It's hard to move money from fiat to BCH.  By "hard", I mean that there's a delay involved somewhere in the process.
It's easy to move from BTC to BCH and vice-versa.  So when 1 sells off, people move from 1 to the other.  BCH is actually *more* prone to spikes and crashes than BTC.  So I think it's risky to buy BCH.  If you do, you're either playing a risky game, or you believe that BTC is dying and BCH is the "real" Bitcoin.  Take that as you will.

Most people that own it don't see it that way. They see it as something that always rises in value.  If the psychology of people wanting to get rich was different then bubbles wouldn't even exist. If you speculate responsibly or hodl for a very long time, then it doesn't really matter. But to the newbies out there? I feel terrible for them.

He didn't say "death".  Just a price collapse. And a temporary one at that.  You know, Bitcoin *has* fallen 80% before? Twice actually!  I don't buy the idea that adoption rates are somehow directly linked to prices.  Did adoption get cut almost in half, then shoot back up last week?  There's also no telling what that adoption rate will reach.  It's not the case that *everyone* needs to be involved for inflated prices to happen.

It's good to see that people here are starting to see the bubble with more clarity. We're mostly all going to make profit no matter what, but it really helps when people see that taking some of that profit is a sound idea.  The people buying now however, I am a bit concerned for.  I don't feel like newbies are assessing risk properly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:30:31
Pretty much, the currencies that you can trade directly for BTC on various exchanges seem to be declining the most.  And when BTC went from like 7000 to 5500, those same alts rallied.  If people had to cash out and then re-buy elsewhere, you wouldn't see this kind of correlation. Trading coin for coin though happens much faster.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:47:55
A Ponzi scheme is a pyramid scheme - when you make money from the people you recruit into the scheme. It requires an infinite supply of people to keep going, and as such is unsustainable.  Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. It may have spawned some pyramid-ish scams, but the asset itself is not.
Greater fool is a different scenario. You don't need a growing number of investors, you just need the belief that there will always be someone else to buy your coin.  That's probably happening to some extent with newer buyers.
But even if that's true, there's no telling where a top might be.  Maybe it was 20K. Maybe it's 60K. Maybe 150K?  The point I like to stress is that timing this thing can't be done.  When we went from 20K to 12K it *looked* like the top of a bubble. When we recovered to 16K, same deal. But the next step would have been to turn lower - since we haven't (yet), then I'm inclined to say that there's more room to rise.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:32:28
That s-curve stuff is total nonsense.  Adoption is not tied to price with a 1:1 linear or N:N^2 quadratic
relationship.  And even if it was, most people aren't adopting it. They are buying it to make money. So for me, stuff like "network effect" is just a price rationalization.  If you want to, go look up cases where any asset had exponential growth that stopped and smoothed out.  There aren't many - and the ones that there are were stocks of companies that were themselves growing profits more and more rapidly.

Every time BTC doubles, it does it faster than the last time.  This is great right now, but a very large decline is all but inevitable at this point. It's just a matter of when, and how long the recovery will take.  We've gone parabolic and are now looking *almost* vertical.  It's going to be a bumpy ride!
That said, I see more short-term upside. It's all going to happen *very* fast. We could be at 15K TODAY and 20K in a couple days.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:25:31
What they'd need to do is buy tons right now, taking a large long position.  Then on the futures market they'd place a leveraged bet on a downturn, then come back and sell the BTC on the market.  They'd gain far more than they lose because of their use of leverage.  Unless they fail to drive the price down, then they'd *lose* tons more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:33
This one is... sharper. I think this may be "the one".  But it's too soon to tell.
There's a spread of damn near $1000.  That's a 1K difference between the highest someone will pay and the lowest someone will sell for.  That's a freakish and awful sign for trading.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:06:07
But the article discusses specific price points and a well-known pattern.  It's more than what you're saying it is.  But it is an inexact science - there are several patterns that all look like this (what we've seen so far), so there's lots of uncertainty.  And this particular chart is... "busy". It looks like modern art with the shaded triangles all over the place!
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:55:19
Go to gdax, look at the 1-day zoom.  Watch the "legs" up.
Late Oct -&gt; Early Nov put us at around 7000 then back to the recent low around 5500. Then there's a bounce - the slope increased and we got to 8000 around Nov 25. Then a bounce to around 12K around Dec 7.  These legs are more or less the same length (and since the slope is increasing, that means less time between legs).  From 12K we shot vertical to 20K (which I thought was the high at the time), but now we can see a more reasonable leg from Dec 7 to today around 20K.
So if nothing breaks in this pattern, just add another leg. Get a ruler and put it up against your screen, increasing the slope and keeping the length the same.  It's a crude method, but it's great for predicting exponential growth in the short term.  I used it to call the rally from 12K (I told many people to not blink, it would be fast!).
This time will be very fast.

That's a big long shot, but if it happened then any established cryptocurrency that people actually transact with (meaning not the altcoins that aren't used for anything yet) would soar. Along with gold, silver, and other precious metals.  For now this is just hypothetical of course.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:07:56
I think you're mistaken about bubbles.  One fact that is true of 100% of them is that you can't predict the top.  It's actually pretty logical if you think about it and look at charts.  Exponential growth has "hiccups" along the way. While the overall trend is higher, there are 20-30% pullbacks (see: this summer).  The top of a bubble looks exactly like a rally, followed by a pullback.  What makes it a top is what comes after - there's no rally to get back to another record high.
You're totally right in that anyone claiming a top is pretty much guessing.  But not so much with your call that there's a long way to go.  How long it lasts is a complicated thing influenced by many factors.  You just can't ever know for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:26:33
You're probably overthinking the situation.  But the price is staying where it is specifically because that isn't happening.  If buyers wanted to wait until a crash they could do so - then sellers would have to discount their price to find buyers and the price would go down.
For now, that's not happening. And even if it did, there's no way you could do anything about it.  As for a coordinated dump, that's always a possibility. But it's really difficult to pull one off - and the decline would be temporary.  So I wouldn't worry about it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:16:40

You can't tell - that's why it's so cool to watch. Every step along the way could be the top.  Yet people still try to call that top!

We've broken a trend line today, the next leg up is going to be pretty fast. Do not be surprised if we see 30K this year!  Exponential growth remains BTC's MO, at least for the short term.
Edit: Can I adjust my call? 27-28K.  I counted incorrectly the first time, oops.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:37:40
That I can't say. If you buy now in anticipation of a spike, you're trying to time the market. Timing the market is very difficult and you're more likely to be wrong than right.  I don't like to give buy/sell advice, I just look at the activity and charts and say what I think is probable. I'm no psychic though!

In response to the several comments about getting over or holding 16K - look at GDAX and move to the 15-minute view.
You can see what's going on with the price level. Volume was very low until last night when you can see a clear upswing in both volume and price.  The 14K figure wasn't special - it could have been any number. The lack of trading is what kept it there.
Now look at the 1-minute view.  Between 3:00 and 3:20, buyers entered, and the volume and price rose. But now, the price looks like it's stuck.  But it's not stuck in the sense that there's too much selling to get over 16K.   It's stuck because buyers and sellers are both absent at the moment.  You can see this in the volume.  
So my advice is to not put so much weight in the specific price level that we "can't get over".  Just give it time - Bitcoin isn't heavily traded, so there will be lulls like this.

This is called a "flash crash", and it's been taken to it's extreme here.  Someone sold so much at once that it consumed the entire bid chain.  That 14K figure may have traded for like... 0.0000001btc, but it was in no way a real price.

It's fascinating from a psychological standpoint.  If a person buys something and it goes up in price, they can choose to sell it and make a profit.  But if you take away that ability to sell at any time, there's a sense of unease among investors.  That's gravy as long as the price is rising- but when it falls, the stress on the investor is so strong that he/she will move into literally any other asset regardless of that asset's value simply to alleviate the negative emotions. Maybe that's psychobabble but it makes sense to me at least.
And from an economics pov it might be even more interesting.  If you are like me and believe that BTC has been forming a bubble lately, then it's no surprise for BTC to fall this quickly.  But unlike prior bubbles, there are tangential assets that became associated with the primary ones that can share in the influx of investor money.  That's why I don't trust BCH for anything other than day trading.  Eventually they'll suffer the same fate, and money will actually leave the cryptocurrency space (not many investors experience 2 back-to-back crashes and decide to stay in the game). 
So for now we get to play ping-pong! Money will just bounce around, hindered only by Coinbase's ineptitude and propensity to crash at inopportune times.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:09:36
A great rebuttal. Unfortunately you're rebutting actual historical fact.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:08
There's a similar pattern there to take note of.  Looking at the anatomy of historical bubbles, the final phase before the pop is when the average Joe gets involved.  Newbies all suddenly realize there's money to be made and buy, pushing the price up. 
Newbies also have no concept of HODL, so they scare easily. And when they all sell, they drive the price down so fast that it starts to scare even more people.  So the rapid user growth is a double-edged sword.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:33:08
It could be triggered by many things.  And if/when it does, I really expect it to be something new. None of the things that's happened so far.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:23
This is hilariously crooked IMO.  Insiders had to know the BCH timing on Coinbase, and they just made gobs of money.  All they had to do was wait for a dip here and then suddenly give everyone another coin to move to if BTC went down. 
BTC is going to crash hard tonight.  BCH will initially benefit, then it'll crash too.

I'm not saying anything about random numbers, I don't get what you mean there. I just used example numbers for calculations. "Throw out" doesn't mean "discard", but "put out on the table for sake of math"!  And you kinda... just ignored my argument with a "blah blah blah". That's a pretty weak way to refute a point.
I'm clearly not going to convince you that your last point could be wrong.  I mean, I believe it is - and that there are many other ways to explain the price increase.   For me, it's wishful thinking and a quirk of human pattern matching that leads to seeing that 94% that you mentioned.  It's not "proof" like you say. At best, it's evidence. So no hard feelings personally!  Thanks for the discussion.

I'm not seeing signs of stopping at 20K personally. Things are just  moving too fast to assume that it'll stop where you expect it to.  So don't try to time this perfectly. You're more likely to *lose* if you try to do that. That's just investment advice in general.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:34:46
Then why even reply?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:10
Much less. If you asked me when we'd get there, I'd say "don't blink".  This is not hyperbole - the potential for insane price increases is there. I'm talking above 20K within a week or so. Maybe higher.  Check my other post  where I linked a chart.  The next rally will be extremely steep.  As in, flying off the top of your screen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:39
You know what would be really crazy?  If Coinbase was deliberately freezing trading in BCH to keep the value high while they waited for BTC to nosedive again.  
I'm not saying they are, so don't take this as an accusation. It's actually pretty smart (and very simple without any regulations on trading).  If you expect some asset X to drop significantly and you control the only other asset Y that can be traded for X, you could just sit back and only allow trading once X had become so toxic that investors in Y wouldn't want to sell. Y could in theory stay at $9500 since the market would be effectively cornered.
Edit: That's... what they already did today.  Open up trading and send out the tweet as BTC is tanking.  This would have the effect of pushing the price up further. Not that I'm accusing them or anything.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:55:12
I agree, but I think tomorrow when investors (professionals that is) are working again (some, but not all of them of course) the price could move.  It's such a thin market that any big traders could have a large short-term impact (at least until other traders re-enter the market).  
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:00:44
This is a very classic argument, so please don't take what I say the wrong way. I'm not trying to offend or call anyone out.  While I may not know as much about Bitcoin as you, you don't know enough about bubbles.  There's something that happens with every single one. In summary: "It's different this time". People always think that their situation is different and new. That rules don't apply to it.  Regardless of how many justifications one can present, the overriding factor is that when people speculate on prices and cause a bubble, logic no longer matters. Bitcoin isn't immune to that, no matter how much it may "feel" like it is.  I can follow along just fine - it's just that the reasons given for Bitcoin  being truly different are flimsy.
Edit: The real reason you don't find many investment terms is that the investors are common people! Bitcoin has attracted non-investors in the last month especially. Of course they won't talk investing! They are just here to see that number go up, which they have been told always happens.
And 1 final thing! Thank you for the congeniality. It's nice to see here!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:17:10
Ah, yeah. I misinterpreted the question.  The answer is still the same, but it would be far less severe. There'd still be a big jump in BTC though, as people move their money out of the stock market as happened in 2013.

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:01:06
Not at all, I'm nearly certain that we're watching an amazing asset bubble, but that's not a reason to be bearish. It's a reason to be careful, that's all. If you called the top say at... 8K? You'd have been badly burned.  That term gets a bad rap here. It doesn't mean anything other than the price got too high too fast and can't be sustained forever.  But how high will it get before it pops? That's something that no one can answer.  So there's no way in hell I'm shorting BTC, I'd likely end up homeless if I did!
When the pattern does change and we sell off, then fail to get back to the prior high I will be more bearish. That's a sign that a big downturn is ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:59:47
I think you misunderstood that first point.  I didn't call the formula a random number. I didn't even use the word "random" in my comments! 
Welcome. And I really can't refute your point the way that you're looking for.  The fact that so far, 94% of the gain can be attributed to Metcalfe's Law is compelling.  That said, it's still a prediction of what's to come (that the increase will continue to follow v=u^2). Not to beat a dead horse, but it's bad logic to assume that past performance will continue.  That's not just true here, but any investment.  Only time can refute anything, so I don't see any great reasons to debate it now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:43
While I still am of the opinion that we're bubbly right now, I don't think it's popping yet. Sure, if the bottom falls out again it may be the case - but the volume is too light.  A true top would have lots of selling volume all at once.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:28:21
v = u^2, yes. I'm going to throw some numbers out for sake of maths.
1000 people hold BTC.  The price is $1/coin.  They are buying stuff - pizza, coffee, drugs (darknet markets).  The coin has utility to them. Some time later, 10000 hold BTC. They are doing the same. It's not mainstream yet, so it's really just people that want to use it to make purchases.  The price goes to $100 (a tenfold increase in users leads to a hundredfold increase in price.  
Now it catches fire! New investors pour in, up to 100000. Most want to make money - their limited knowledge of bitcoin is that it always goes up.  You'd then expect another 100x in the price, to $10K.  But many of these investors aren't transacting. Their interest is just in selling it to another person after it goes up.  Say that 50% of them are just HODLing (some forever!).  The actual value of u isn't 100K - it's 50K.  The ones that aren't in the network can't be counted.  So the price, by the same logic, would be $2500 rather than $10000.
We just don't know how many people this applies to. I used 50% because it's a nice number for math - but it could be less or it could be more.  But it is *at least* greater than 0%.  Not considering this leads to inaccurate price projections.  How inaccurate? Well, we just don't know.
Metcalfe's law has also never been applied to an asset before.  This is primarily why I see it as a rationalization.

Isn't that just *bad* for this place though? They all say they hodl, but when things turn sour they bolt.  What's that going to do with genuine newbies?  They'll see the panic from people that claim to be old-school holders for life and it'll influence them.  They aren't going to view post histories or anything, they'll just panic if the situation seems to warrant it.
Not to mention the post quality. So many memes... So many.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:58:22
The walls tend to be ephemeral - big players like to put them and get people to buy or sell in large quantities in an effort to tear down the wall.  Then the orders are canceled - and the buying momentum suddenly has no counter, and the price soars. Then, like magic, the same "wall" appears at a higher price.  Now when a wall really gets eaten, it's a beautiful thing to watch!
I see that getting to 25K will be easy if we get above 20K and hold there for a bit. What I disagree with is that the price would be flat for any substantial time period beyond that point. Exponential rises just don't go flat like that - they always overrun and have to come back down before stabilizing. 
Disclaimer: I don't advocate using this primitive method for much else! Only rapid exponential growth.

"Little dip". Have you looked at any charts? This week's price activity is not at all normal, even for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:13:43
Oh, sorry there. My mistake.  The order book looks like this now, but there's no way to predict what it will look like if we do rally toward 25K.  When we were at 12K, the order book stopped at 18K or so. And that didn't prevent a rally to 20K!  How fast they get put in I don't know. But now institutions are involved and they tend to operate very quickly (on the order of microseconds when it comes to the stock market).  So I think that the book would fill out in no time flat.  That's pretty new for BTC, since before recently there simply weren't enough whales in the market.
I have no real idea what happens after 25K (well, I still like my 28K call).  What history tells us is that it'll continue to rise exponentially faster and faster, then at some point it'll fail to do so, then it'll drop off a cliff.  It's almost impossible to imagine going to 20K when you're at 8K and just doubled from 4K like this summer. The chart just looks too steep, like it can't keep rising.  
But it definitely can! Even if 28K looks insane when it happens (and it will *look* like a bubble top, much like 20K did a couple weeks ago), there can almost always be another leg up.  The time when we went from 8K to 5.5K looked like a crash when it happened, but now if you zoom out it's a hiccup, barely.

I don't believe that's the case. At least not without more evidence. A bunch of new accounts can be explained much more easily by the fact that there are a ton of new buyers showing up because of the growing media attention.  I'm not saying you're wrong exactly.

I don't disagree.  I  do however think it's a good idea to know what *may* happen.  Too many people genuinely believe that Bitcoin can never go down despite evidence to the contrary.  They are almost assured to lose money when they panic sell.

Yeah, it is. Sorry to say, but all the signs are there.  Every bubble grows logarithmically until it doesn't. Every one looks consistent until it doesn't.  Every bubble claims that it's "different" and "not normal", so the old rules don't apply.  Every bubble has sketchy explanations to justify a high price. Every bubble has experts calling much higher values. Every bubble has greed and non-investors wanting to get rich quick.
But here's the thing. You can't call a top. It may be at 20, 30, 50, 100K or even higher.  So there's reason to be excited but also reason to be cautious.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:45:03
Still in the 14K to 16K zone, but it's close to breaking out. Getting above 16K would be a sign of a short-term bottom.  Just a little further!
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:58:02
I mean this year, and though it sounds crazy, I used the same logic when we got to 12K. People were saying "14K by 2018!" and I looked at the pattern of growth and said "14K by... tonight. And higher. Don't blink!".  We got to 20K within a day.
Logarithmic increases surprise you, especially when we've just hit support and are at the end of the most recent leg up.  This won't continue forever of course, but if it holds for now, the price is going vertical.  You can see my most recent post (check my history) to see a brief overview of what I'm seeing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:06:50
I have been thinking about it for the last few months!  Now I don't mean this about Bitcoin in particular, but what you're describing is well-documented.  While you may not like the "bubble" label, that's precisely what causes them. Some people that think it can't go down won't cause a giant price spike. Almost everyone thinking the same thing *can*.  A bubble "popping" is nothing more than a feedback loop of:
Price is high, some people sell -&gt; Price falls fast -&gt; Price is now lower, triggering more selling -&gt; and so on until a reversal happens.  The longer it goes, the more panicky newbies, and the bigger the chance that the initial slide will start.
I'm not predicting this here - at least not now. And I certainly won't have any timing predictions.  What you should take away from this is that historically there's an extremely high chance that at some point, the "it always goes up" belief will stop.  If nothing else, you're too naive IMO in assuming that everyone will always HODL like you and many others do.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:25:57
There's literally no way to know.  What I can do somewhat reliably is make calls on where it goes given that a certain price level was hit, but... it's like forecasting the weather. Sometimes it surprises you, and Bitcoin is so freaky that it always surprises.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:46:09
That's right, and as new people enter Bitcoin the price should rise. But there's also a competing force that becomes more and more problematic as the price rises. That force is investor fear and emotion. The higher the price goes, the more likely we are to have attracted droves of flaky investors who panic at the first sign of trouble.  Once a price tumbles, it becomes hard to stop, as each tick downward also moves some number of people from the "Long term hodler" camp to the "fearful novice" camp.  
So you have strength from investor growth growing while potential for a crash also grows.  If growth keeps up (historically fueled by easy access to debt), the former force can dwarf the latter for a surprisingly long time.  I still just don't think we can actually predict when this balance of power breaks down.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:59:47
Despite that it's still an asset that can be speculated on.  You're expecting bitcoin to somehow be immune to this but it's not. 100% of bubbles think that they are different. Please, research this! If you're confident that this time is different then there's nothing to fear from informing yourself.
What's happening with the price is textbook bubble growth. It seems convenient that the adoption curve you mentioned looks exactly the same during the growth period.  It's just a bad idea to assume that this growth can continue forever. It's mathematically impossible in fact!
So please don't take offense to this, but you're using wishful thinking.  When thousands of people with 0 investing experience suddenly understand exactly how things work and repeat the same rationalizations, I think one should be skeptical.  And while you may have tons of experience, your logic is carbon-copied from the newbies here.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:22:36
There's tons of money held by investment firms and individual wealthy investors sitting "on the sidelines".  There's also easier access to debt by way of futures trading- with low interest rates supporting the cash flow into BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:33
Yeah, all volume has died down though. That doesn't mean anything bad really, but it does hint that when one side gets back into action there won't been many active traders on the other side for a short time. This just means more volatility once it does happen, at least for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:08:00
That's the bid/ask spread! The buying and selling happened so fast that at one point the highest offer from a person wanting to buy was $600 lower than the lowest offer for sale. So even trading 0.00001 coins can seemingly move the price $600. All the market price is is the last price that was transacted. It doesn't matter how small that volume was.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:25:33
This is all really nice, although it won't matter. I mean, it'll matter to us. To the hodlers. But not to the newbies.  Logic didn't bring them here and logic won't keep them if a downturn happens. It's all emotion for them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:10
Hello there Zeno!  I'm not sure what you mean though.  All you can really say with any certainty is at some point the pattern stops and the price falls some amount. Who knows when/how this will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:47:53
That's so far from the truth it's almost funny!  A bubble is such that you can't say for sure if it is. It doesn't mean that because you think it is that it can't be. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:15:48
Volume is again much lower today. Lower than yesterday even, which was low to begin with.  It's looking like even the big players are taking some time off to enjoy Christmas.
As for future action, the chart looks like it puts us in "no mans land".  I feel like a big move is coming in the next couple days, depending on which direction we break out of this channel in.

No asset rises exponentially and then just smooths out to a flat line. It just doesn't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:57:50
That's just a silly rationalization. Adoption of a technology and the value of the network can increase like that but you cannot extend it to a price level increasing the same way.  Look at the price and the number of users over the last 3 months.  Clearly, one has risen MUCH faster - so much that the math doesn't work out. There just aren't enough users in the network yet.
And speaking of the network effect - if people are HODLing and not transacting, they aren't in the network.  Most people buying now just want to make money, not to use bitcoin the same way that they use cash today.

It's not just the end of a chain of messages, it's a specific cryptographic key that you and only you have the rights to until you decide to transfer it.  It's a bit more tangible than you make it sound!
I agree though. If there's trust in that idea, it can hold value.  "Trust" is different for fiat v crypto, but it's still the case that they both have value because people trust that they have value.

Most of the people that smugly dismiss any idea of a bubble don't have a strong grasp of what a bubble is.
"If Bitcoin is a bubble then the Internet is a bubble lol!"
No, one is an asset. With a value determined by the market.  A bubble refers specifically to asset prices.  A bubble doesn't mean something that is growing quickly.

To some extent it definitely is. We have all these unregulated exchanges, nothing is stopping institutional traders from throwing their weight around. I'm not much for regulating anything crypto-related, but if it's going to be bought and sold like any other currency then I don't want to rely on the stuff we have now.

So if BTC crashed today, BCH, BTGold, Eth, LC, and others would shoot up incredibly fast (Just look at BCH's rally when we went from 8000 to 5500).  This only applies to established currencies that people are really transacting with.  The smaller alts that had a recent ICO? I would not touch them with a 10 foot pole.  If BTC crashes it'll bring most of the alts with it. Confidence in them will be totally shot.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:55
I don't think so, GDAX trade history only goes back so far.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:40:03
The pattern we were in was one of exponential growth, short pauses, then exponential growth at a higher slope.  So you see the chart getting steeper and steeper and steeper, the rallies happen faster (20% increase in a day), and faster (40%!), and faster (80%!) and so on. 
But there's a problem with a pattern where the growth rate keeps doubling. Mathematics. Eventually the rallies happen so fast that the chart goes vertical and there's nowhere else to go but waaaay back down.   This is why the long-term [Bitcoin Chart]( is worrying to me and many others.
Where we are right now, who knows. I can't give advice for your investments. But I can say that you're right to be slightly skeptical.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:56:27
Your stance is that they don't really speak much English (they live on the other side of the world and were paid to copy+paste stuff here)?  That's effectively the same as a bot IMO.  You can't communicate with them.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:25
Please don't read too much into this. It's just a matter of price and media attention.  If you've noticed, the news has been good lately. Stories are reporting on price gains so of course they'll be positive and people will be bullish.  But media isn't really doing anything big - they are just telling people the price.
If the price falls, media turns negative.  Again, it's only because they don't do anything but repeat the price back to us.  And if that scares people, you'll get more negative comments. It's a feedback loop - the media can then take it and run the price down further.
If you try to concoct some theory about what "fishy" stuff is happening you'll end up chasing your tails.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:23
Well shit! I didn't buy into many of the pump-and-dump theories so far, but now? Look at GDAX! 2900 (and rising) coins for sale at $9500, and no one is biting. No one has for several minutes.  The price is only holding at $9500 because that's the last price a sale took place at.  In actuality, the market there *does not exist*.  
When sellers start to enter orders that will be filled, then that value is going to fall apart in a blink.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:01:38
How can you be confident with that price prediction when it's pretty clear that people buying now have no real idea what a good valuation is?  These numbers just feel made up to me.  I can understand general up/down calls though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:16:54
Same here.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:58
Exponential growth / going parabolic. You hear that lots here, but it really shows on GDAX right now. 
This is a very very basic piecewise linear curve. We get a rally, then a selloff, then go flat for a bit, then begin to rally again.  This latest rally is quite a bit steeper.  
If the pattern holds, then you can imagine another trend line starting shortly in the future, about the same length, and steeper - about twice as steep.   That would mean 19K or so looks like the next short-term high.  You can keep doing this if you'd like - double the slope each time.  
Just be aware that this pattern is unsustainable. That's not really my opinion, but rather a matter of mathematics.  You can only double faster so many times before you're talking about doubling in a day. or hours, or minutes.  In theory (not practice of course) the price could tend toward infinity as the rally duration tends toward the Planck time.  After that, the universe itself forbids continuation of the pattern.  In practice the duration never gets that small and the trend is broken before going to infinity.
tl;dr: Just watch the price, everyone. This is a one-in-a-lifetime event!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:18:57
There's resistance at 15700...ish. Could be a near-term base to rally as far as around 18000. But who the hell knows at this point, it's too chaotic.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:00
This move down has been a bit odd.  There was no buy-side activity for like 1000 points. Just red eating at the order book. No real buy orders were even entered into the book during that time.  This primes us for more volatility in both directions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:30
I tend to agree, but I'm also skeptical.  Consider this - if someone who never invested before came and bought BTC at $1000, they'd be very very happy today.  During the rise they'd clearly be bullish, and they'd continue to predict higher prices.  It's hard to *not* act like this when you see your investment doubling 2, 3, even 4 times over.  Chances are, that person would still be bullish today.  
Now if that newbie was calling the price movements the whole way, he/she would have been right all along, every time, consistently - but accidentally!  
My point is to just be a bit cautious, since during a period of repeated rallies and new highs, the newbie using wishful thinking and the cryptocurrency expert will look and sound exactly the same.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:31:36
Fair enough! But I can't take your bet. Not because I don't plan to pay out, but because your bet effectively says "I bet no one else gets within 50 bucks". You'd probably win that bet!
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:53:52
If it's scary, you might have too much invested. Treat it like a speculative bet.  That way you won't ever be disappointed.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:45:11
That's not necessarily true. There are people buying now despite transactions being backed up big time.  That increases the price.  The price is decoupled from the utility of the asset - that's one reason it's impossible to predict.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:29:13
Sure, but on the futures market they could have more success moving the price than they do today. No one has yet been able to short BTC in this way. It's certainly not something i'd hang my hat on, but it's worth watching.
Edit for a goofy typo =/
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:42
The last time it got really backed up it was like 12 hours or so.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:08:30
That's not correct. Every asset bubble pops eventually. It's mathematically impossible for one to last forever.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:23:45
And now, about... 90 seconds later, it's broken down. The next resistance is waaaaaay far off, like thousands of dollars. We're in no-man's land.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:25:19
That's all well and good, and well might be 100% true. But how does that make the asset immune to speculation?  Because as it stands, it's just another asset. It's exciting new technology, but most cases of speculative buying are.  I'm not interested in trash talking BTC so please don't take this that way.  Just want to hear some other opinions.
Your description works for the internet too!
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:09:03
I have to go against the tide of people saying that BTC is down for dozens of reasons, most of which are related to being "attacked" in some way.
It's getting more and more obvious that too much speculation drove prices up, now people are starting to panic.  This isn't 1 person dumping all at once, it's all the newbies that bought above 7000 getting scared and selling.
So the price falls to 6500, and it scares the people who bought between 6500-7000. Fear-based feedback loops are bad juju for asset prices.  This is going to take out dozens of altcoins too, they are a baaaad place to be right now.

What it is is software trading. In the stock market, exchanges allow you more access to the inner workings of the exchange - like order feeds coming in for example.  When you're making a program to trade for you, you need to teach it how to handle different events. To do that, it needs to know where prices are down to a fraction of a second. So it puts out pings - little bids that probably won't be filled, and in fact might be canceled immediately after hitting the exchange. See how the highest bid often goes up 1 cent at a time very quickly? That's the pinging. After 1 gets filled, the software knows exactly where it's at.  
I wouldn't even be surprised if bots are trading against bots. The way it worked on wall street is that competing algorithmic trading firms had a perfect handle on how to beat the market, with 1 exception. The other trading firms.  So they started to look at each others orders in their data feeds, then try to position themselves so they'd always "win".  Well, that went on for a bit - but some firms got smart. They decided to bomb the market with millions of tiny orders and immediately (like, microseconds later) cancel those orders.  Other bots would have to look at every single garbage order and therefore be unable to see *real* orders.
That's my take, at least.

@_date: 2017-11-21 18:10:28
I agree with most of this. I do have a problem with bubbles though - they can ruin lives. Imagine if you were drawn in by Bitcoin's rally. You bought a coin at $7000 and are now ahead.  If you keep seeing nothing but big gains, you're more likely to want to buy more.  If you believe that gains are a sure thing (a very big red flag when too many people believe this), why would you NOT put your life savings into BTC?
But there are always people that decide to do that at the near-term top. And when the price falls 75%, they panic, liquidate, and suddenly their lives and the lives of their family members are damaged.  Thats the human side of asset bubbles.  It happened to people that bought at $1000 and saw the price fall to $250. Now that Bitcoin is hitting the mainstream, the nice time a decline like that happens it's going to hit many more people.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:53:47

My opinion is that it's got further to go. Take that as it is, 1 opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:08:22
My position is that BTC formed a speculative asset bubble, peaking at around 7800. Historical examples suggest that the action after the high can be grouped into 3 phases. First, accelerating price declines, ending in a sudden downward spike as the first bit of fear wins out. We went down to 6000, then sharply down to 5600.  Second, a bear trap bounce. Sentiment changes on a dime, prices soar, and everyone expects a rally back above the all-time highs.  We went from 5600 to 6300, now 6100.  Everything has been in-line with history so far.
Phase 3 is extremely ugly.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:50:21

You've got the right idea. I personally don't like buying anything at an ATH (there's always a better entry if you wait!), however I'm probably older than you so take less risk.  But I'm a bit mixed up. You said you sold all your stocks, but you still own AAPL?  
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:32:38
I don't know how to say it without sounding bad, but whatever. This is a trap, buying here thinking it's a bottom is a poor idea.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:30:57
It's the human factor, but not as much related to news as you'd think. Once many new investors pour in, the most minor negative news can scare them out.  People that HODL from the early days aren't selling - they are more resistant to news. The guy that put $10K in yesterday and sees that he's down $600? He gets out at the first sign of trouble.  There are dozens of historical examples of this happening if anyone wants to go do some research.
Major players are selling because they want to take profits. Newbies are the ones buying from oldies.  Both of them are in fact determining the price/value. It's a free market, so everyone "controls" the price to some extent.

You can see the entire list of people looking to buy and sell there. Other exchanges are similar but I like GDAX the most. You can zoom way out and see where all the bidding activity is. Right now between 6200 and 6220 there are about 200 btc worth of sell orders sitting out there. For the price to get past 6220 you'd need to find 200 in buyers.

This is a pretty important point to hold. If there's a bounce from here, 7000 tonight wouldn't be out of the question.  If we start to move too much lower the next point of resistance looks pretty far off.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:38:09
It's going to move soon (if charts mean anything, that is). Who knows where, but it's a good time to watch for rapid price moves.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:32:04
If you expect the price to fall 50% before soaring, then it's pretty obvious. Would you rather have $500K in 5 years, or $250K?

5700 is stout because of the buyers at 5700. That's worth watching too, but I think 5700 to 5550 if it happens will be in a blink.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:17:40
That doesn't look anything like a bubble to me. 1999/2000 does, but the rally recently doesn't. It's growth but it's steady growth - not doubling price faster and faster like it did in 2000.  Bubbles can take place over a very long stretch - and Amazon may end up to be in one! But there's no indication of that right now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:15:41
IF, I'm not saying that it is, but if we're in a bubble, we can look back to the 2013 bitcoin bubble to get a handle on what we might expect.
That rise from $50 to $200 happened very quickly. After the pop, prices fell under 70, then stabilized in the 100-125 range, about 50% of the value from the top. Of course, it recovered and continued to rise to get us to where we are.
But a fall to the 3000-4000 range (while I am NOT predicting one) would not be unprecedented.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:33:35

Look at the dot com days - the last few years of the 1990s into 2000 and 2001. The Dow Jones is the "major" stock index, but the Nasdaq is also a big one. It's full of newer companies (tech-heavy), and in those days people wanted internet companies no matter what. Even companies that never made money.  The perception at the time was like:
"It doesn't matter if these companies make money! That was old economy, this is NEW economy!". And it made people rich!  The last thing I'll say about it: Look at this stock chart of the Nasdaq:
Another: The Nikkei, Japan's exchange:
2 takeaways. One, the exponential curve of growth isn't sustainable.  Two, we've recovered - higher today than ever before. But it took 17 years.
The first thing about BTC that scared me is the chart. It looks really, really like the one I linked.

This thread seems to have died but I don't see another. There have been lots of positives in the last 24 hours, and we're on the verge of another potentially. Gotta get back above 6750 IMO.

Been following this for a couple years during the rallies and crashes. You're totally right at this point. It's not until a much larger decline that people here start to panic. And there are a few stages that happen between here and panic, too. We're still very far off from that happening.

Good idea, but you're vastly overestimating the knowledge that most people here have. A month ago this would have really been interesting, but we're getting flooded with newbies asking questions like:
"What is this fork? How do I benefit?"
"What is blockchain?"
"When should I buy and sell?"

Everyone has their own level of conviction, but if you were watching new posts during last night's plunge you'd see what I mean. People came out of the woodwork asking questions like "I don't want to sell now, but how do I sell quickly?" or "I'm selling a very minor portion of my BTC" or the soon-to-be infamous "I'm HODLing, but there's no reason not to sell now and buy at a lower price later". That last one isn't HODLing at all of course. But fear can change minds fast.
I don't claim that you, personally, will get scared and sell. But many people will.

Most of the people dabbling in these currencies don't have any preference of coin. It's just a way to get rich quick for them.  So I wouldn't take this as an indication of how the public feels.  It's actually rather unfortunate, because while people are trading based on emotion, their actions will have real long-lasting effects.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:09:57
Yes, pretty much out of nowhere and seemingly for no reason. Psychology and emotion are driving movement now. Just like the plunge from 6000 to 5600 and the bounce back to 6400.  That wasn't "EU waking up". That was a few gigantic trades over a 30 second period that rallied btc above 6000. A common response to too much short-term selling.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:30:15
You cannot time those dips and rallies.  You think you can, but it's not as easy as it seems.  This isn't saying anything about you as a trader (you may be a hotshot superstar!), but rather the market. You're trading against movements determined by other traders. You can be brilliant but your trades will always be at the whim of the other non-brilliant traders.  If those traders act irrationally, you cannot predict what they'll do. This makes timing short-term moves nearly impossible.
Give it a shot with a small dollar value first if you want to try.

@_date: 2017-11-24 02:38:04
On  Do you expect the parabolic rise to continue? How long? Exponential growth without bounds is pretty darn rare. And assuming growth in the past will continue to the future is a classic investing mistake.
No argument on  - it's clearly not dying, and probably not at its ATH. But it won't necessarily only go up - there may be better entry points. Is now a good time to buy? I don't think it's 100% clear either way.
Number 4 doesn't mean much. Bandwagon investors signing up is a classic indicator of unsustainable gains. Not always the case, but it's not always positive.
Number 5 is pretty simple but doesn't say much. The market cap is rising because the price is rising, yes. That's not a reason to not sell however. Some people may have a good reason to sell even with increasing prices. 
I get that you love your new investment, but you bought in a week ago. And you're trying to convince yourself that the price will always go up. I hope you are right, because I want everyone to come out ahead! But there are just so many posts exactly like yours this week - new accounts talking to themselves about why their investment was a good one.  You want reassuring answers and upvotes, which you'll get.  From... other people in your shoes.

I used GDAX,  but there are others.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:16:53
I think it's still a very nervous market despite what you see here (HODL mentality tends to push negative and nervous sentiment out of the way).  That kind of plunge like the one we saw always comes with more volatility. Smoothly strolling along past 6800 isn't at all what I'd expect afterward.  I think that the volume decline today (cut in half, about) is from shorts and sellers not trading much. So there's my concern, there may be more selling pressure. But for most that'd not a problem (just buy more!). 
I hate trying to time tops and bottoms though :/
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:56:23
It depends where the next high is. When is the fork happening? That will complicate things.
We're also nearing the end of a tax year. People often sell assets for tax purposes (selling losers and winners to offset) and it's hard to find a bigger winner than BTC.  If that happens then there will be a marked decline followed by a bounce to start 2018.  
You can see this especially from 2012-2013 when some top-end temporary tax cuts expired. People sold so they could get taxed at a lower cap gains rate and then immediately bought back in in 2013.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:18:05
"Something has always done this, therefore it will always continue to do the same" is one of the fundamental logical traps that investors need to be aware of.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:17:00
Allow me to give some advice. You know all those wild price swings, like 50-100 points at a time? Those aren't "real" prices for the most part. The transactions going through are all for tiny fractions of a coin.  Given the right market conditions, buying or selling a single coin can move the price significantly. 
Once you see that fact, the anxiety watching the live chart tends to go down.  Instead you'll look at trends, which on top of being less stressful actually tell you more about what BTC is doing.

Pretty much, since post-fork there will be lots of 2x coins out there - some people want those coins so they are holding BTC until then, after which they will sell. Other people want to sell the 2x and buy BTC - which will look more appealing if it gets beaten down.  Just gotta wait and see (unless you are in one of those two groups, which means you can't wait - gotta act!).
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:47:45
5600 will come faster than you think, in my estimation. Unless there's a rapid bounce here. It's a mistake to think that because btc has retraced similarly after each high that it'll continue to do so forever.

The dot com bubble, after it popped, led to a moderate length recession. It didn't implode the industry... but it did negatively impact it.  Additionally, they did try to prevent it (by raising interest rates), and having the chairman of the Fed come out and say to watch out for "Irrational Exuberance".
Long term investors don't care of course, like you said.  But as long as people want short-term gains, prices can get out of hand.

Start from 7200 - the 7800 was very temporary (and not many bitcoins actually traded at that value).  And yes, it's sharp. But these kinds of drops cannot be predicted. It's the combined psychology of thousands of people all at once - too chaotic to figure out.  Where it turns is anyone's guess.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:38:32
I think you have it backwards. BCH didn't soar because people were pumping and dumping it, causing BTC to fall.
BTC was just too high, and sellers panicked as they often do. BCH just benefitted from these bandwagon investors. Think about it - they came here very late trying to get rich quick. What will they do when they see BTC fall and BCH go up? New bandwagon time. They'll get cleaned out there too (sucks to be them).

The rapid influx of investors that have never invested before is one of the red flags. Booming interest in media is also one.  Bitcoin is the new gold - stuff like that is setting off alarms for me.  That's not balancing out, it's reinforcing!  These new buyers will be scared out of the market very quickly. Remember that they didn't buy in at 500, 1000, 2000, etc. They are buying at 7000-7500. The early investors aren't going to sell at this point, but the bandwagon ones will.
The CME will add a wrinkle but I'm not sure exactly how. So I'm in a holding pattern for now. Keep in mind that futures contracts have daily limits - a 12-15% daily move in BTC will trigger those limits and trading will halt on the CME.  This may lead to a disconnect with actual prices, causing frenzied trading the next day, which can also trigger limits, etc. It could be a very rapid feedback loop.
ETFs next year will clearly increase demand and lead to higher prices. But first we need to have a handle on what a fair value for BTC is. And that's very difficult to pin down right now.
Edit for everyone: I could write up tons more, but just use Google or Bing or whatever. If this isn't a bubble and you think prices will go higher, you have nothing to lose by informing yourself.

@_date: 2017-11-22 19:09:30
That was a good investment.  Risk is good when you're young, but you should also know 100% that you won't panic sell if say, AAPL got cut in half.  Not every risky trade is a big winner. If you've got the nerves for it, you're good.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:33:30
You can't compare value between a stock exchange and 1 asset like that, they are too disparate imo. And I know I'm going to sound like a broken record, but "It's different this time" is (you guessed it) a red flag, one of the biggest indicators of trouble. It's also the title of a really famous book about historical bubbles:
The pattern is always the same. The arguments for why it's different start good, but get weaker and weaker as time goes on. Again, it's just worth watching more closely. I wouldn't panic yet if at all. But I really don't want to see people get blown out here.
Edit: The factors that prevent a correction are ephemeral. In the face of falling prices, those factors tend to disappear.

Breaking under 6000 looks to be difficult, but if it happens then the bottom is sadly going to fall out.

They can hurt the technology in the short-term, but only because people have a bitter taste in their mouths when it comes to that technology.

Don't group me in with other people here please. I didn't call for any crashes until very recently. Because until recently there were no warning signs.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:42:44
Can it be both? Bitcoin has seen 1000% increases in the past, and each time it has pulled back a large amount (30-50%) before resuming the rally.  Yes, it's going to gain more monetary value compared to fiat in the long run. But even with all the things that make bitcoin different, it can still be used as a risky short-term investment by people that don't trust it or even understand it yet want to make a quick profit.
I'm not calling for a crash or anything, because I'm not psychic.  And I don't want for anyone to read too much into what I'm saying.  I believe that any short-term decline will be just that - temporary, with more growth to come.  But this recent run-up is hitting many of the marks for identifying an asset bubble.
"Bubble" does not mean that BTC is worthless or going to 0 - just that it's run up too quickly. I still expect exponential growth to continue for years into the future. But I also expect a pullback from these recent highs. I intend to buy on that pullback.
For reference, here's the wiki article section that I'm looking at.

It's not boring on Gdax. Sure, the price isn't moving much but volume keeps going up and up.  There's an off the wall amount of sell side activity, "YUUUUUUGE" (to quote a certain someone) open orders.

They were bubbles. They ran up too fast, crashed, then stabilized. Bubble doesn't mean "going to 0 forever", it's just an inflated asset, nothing more.  Case in point - we're higher today than during those bubbles.

Wishful thinking based on BCH-&gt;BTC cash flowing back and forth at an insane rate. Also, the mempool issue clearing. And BCH difficulty increasing.
Long story short there are many potential triggers for a BTC increase, but none of them are guaranteed to actually do anything.

Yes, and it'll grow. Then bitcoin will pop and soar, and sentiment will turn on a dime and news will be good. Then it'll turn again, and news will follow it. News in this case is a trailing indicator.

Almost certain that it'll rally back above 6000. Possibly far above 6000. But it won't stay up there for long.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:00:32
It depends what happened after that. It's not so much him saying it (if he did at $460 then he's a pretty smart man and savvy investor. Who would have thought?!). Frenzied buying by people that don't know what they are buying leads to irrational pricing. Only time will tell, but this volatility now is keeping me out of trading for the time being.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:32:01
There's a chunk of bids ~7000 on GDAX, resistance is likely. If we break 7000, the next resistance level is likely far off.

Not trolling. It's people in denial. It's like every other bubble ever, when prices turn, rather than accept that the party is over investors find ANY reason for the decline and a reason to believe it'll go back up.  When there's a bounce, they get giddy again (seeing that now), and soon enough it'll be back to "blame BCH for everything" mode. It's incredibly predictable.
Clearly there's no logical thought going into comments like OPs. It's just "I need to believe something that makes the anxiety go away".
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:03:41
Gdax too. 6000 even, there was about 250btc on the buy side that got eaten along with the rest, down to 5950. Crazy moves here.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:42:05
Weak hands is still a solid answer, but it doesn't explain ALL of the selling. But when it comes to the bandwagon, that's pretty much it.  They haven't seen Bitcoin rise from pennies to thousands, so they have much less conviction.

@_date: 2017-11-12 18:02:03
Depends when they got it.
Group X: Bought BTC near the highs, panicked, sold BTC, saw another get-rich-quick opportunity and moved immediately to BCH.
Group Y: Never bought BTC. Saw BCH soaring, wanted to get rich quick, bought it.
When X sells BCH, they're out. Maybe altcoins, but they'll have "lost" twice very rapidly.  When Y sells BCH they'll buy BTC, especially if it's rallying.

@_date: 2017-11-09 21:02:45
It's risky. Any volatile asset shouldn't be a large percentage of your portfolio. If you are younger, go overweight BTC. If you are older, it's probably not a great idea to hold.  That doesn't make it a bad investment, but it's not one to sink your life savings into. No investment is!
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:22:49

@_date: 2017-11-12 15:00:34
This is the trap that I expected last night - jumped to 6300 out of nowhere. ATH is not going to happen again soon imo, so be careful trading here.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:46:10
6100 support is key. It's not quite as significant as 6000 was last night, but it's pretty big.
Edit: I like what's going on so far. Enough time holding here and we can look for a rally to 6400 or so. But the bottom is still paper-thin near 6050. So far this is better than it looked earlier though.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:10:08
It's awful advice to someone with debt problems. Any investment is not guaranteed to increase in value. Debt IS guaranteed to increase in value (decreasing the wealth of the holder). 
Buying a risky asset when you are in debt as a way to get out of debt is absurd.

@_date: 2017-11-15 03:38:33
I know that everyone's looking for the price to go up and up and up, but it doesn't always do that. So in one regard, the volatility is a good thing for investors. BTC keeps giving people entry points since it tends to swing so wildly back and forth.   It's impossible to hit all of these bottoms or even a few. Most people don't ever buy at the absolute low, so there's no need to beat yourself up.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:55:22
Quite a run since the last correction a mere 6 weeks ago! The pattern lately has been a 100-150% increase followed by a 30% pullback. See:
May/June -&gt; 1250, up to 3000, back to 2000.
July/Sep -&gt; 2000, up to 4500, back to 3500.
Oct/Now -&gt; 3500, up to 6500, back to ?
For everyone new to investing, it's easy to try to find causes of these pullbacks. I advise against looking for reasons. The biggest reason for a pullback when looking at a rapidly appreciating asset is that people want to take profits.
HODL is what we're all about. Banks and hedge funds on the other hand are not - they want to lock in profits. And looking at the way volume has been fluctuating recently it's clear that big money is involved. You can see when they enter and exit. You can even see really odd repeating volume patterns.  At some point selling volume will accelerate as more people exit to try exit with a large short-term gain.
If this happens (and it has done so going back several years), the next pullback will get us to the 4500/5000 range. Again, don't freak out if this happens. It's not a sign that something is wrong. It's just an inevitable outcome, emerging out of the psychology of buying and selling and making profit.  
If you freak at 5000 and exit, you'll miss the next run - the one that will get us to the 12000/14000 range.
Edit: It's 8PM, Eastern Standard, November 1, 2017. I am putting this here for posterity and so that I don't have to make a new post that gets downvoted to oblivion. I personally feel that we are very close to a strong pullback, and the current price action is a short-term bubble.  Last retracement periods: 34 days, 20 days, 9 days. The pullbacks are getting shorter and shorter. I hope I am wrong!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:35:08
Sweetness! Sure enough that W bottom took us past 6500 like i hoped and predicted. Now we have to hold 6400 for awhile, and hopefully pass 6700. That would send another buy signal that would carry us to 7000.  Under 6400 for too long and I expect a bigger dip.
Today will be a wild one, dont blink or you may miss out!
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:17:40
It seems like people selling BTC are pretty much just buying BCH rather than cashing out or buying other alts. It's a baaaad move on their part.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:36:09
No asset that is publicly traded is immune to bubbles, I don't know where you got your definition.  There's literally only one thing needed for a bubble. Lots and lots of buyers that expect the price to rise forever and never come down.  Your last sentence suggests that you are slightly mistaken on the definition of "bubble".
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:04:04

5700 looks strong if buyers have conviction. There's a bid for 338 coins there, that's big. If it breaks that, um.
 Support? :(
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:40:56
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:00:31
I fully expect that to happen, since sentiment is pretty good right now. But if the price did fall lower than 5600, that would change in a hurry. 
HODLers have seen price dips and even crashes in the past. And HODL do what HODL do, always eventually coming out ahead.  Things were pretty sour during the last drop to that 5600 level, with a bunch of posts about selling and buying back at a lower price.  Now that prices have risen, it looks the same as any other price decline - very temporary. 
What HODLers haven't seen before is 2 price dips, the second one being lower, in rapid succession.  That breaks the illusion that this drop is just the same as any other.  Fear is a powerful motivator, and no matter what rationale is given, many HODLers will be selling fast.  
No one wants to see that happen, but if it does it'll be immediately obvious to everyone.  I'm hoping that we can avoid it or prevent it from happening but I'm not sure how much success we'll have.  Emotions driving trading = extremely volatile market.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:13:31
It may be, it all depends how you do feel and how it may change if the price goes up or down significantly. A little fear is a good thing, it motivates you to take action when it's necessary. Right now since we just rallied back from a low I don't expect many people to be worried at all. That can change, but I like the current good vibes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:08
The only reason that it needs to stop and turn on a dime is enough buyers thinking it's a good time to get in. If you don't believe me, just wait a bit! It'll be very sudden.

Growing pains. I mean, it's more complicated than that, but not too much. There's an 80% chance that BTC is higher 3 years from now.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:05:49
I do hope that you're right and there's a long run ahead, but I think you should be aware that it might not be the case. Even if it does, continuation of the rally isn't a guarantee.  Look at your chart that you linked: In 2013, that was a parabolic rise. You can't really tell using the log scale, but it looked the same as what's going on today.  At any point in that rise it could have stopped - and eventually it did. That's all I really want to caution you about, that Bitcoin has done this before, twice. Both rallies gave very little indication that they were about to come to an abrupt end.
You're spot on with the timing problem. You really cannot do it consistently. Dollar cost averaging and holding for the long term makes more sense, is likely to give you better returns, and definitely is easier on your nerves!
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:31:14

@_date: 2017-11-13 03:00:51
Imagine you want to get on an airplane to fly to some wonderful far-off land. You get a bus to the airport, and the bus lets you off. Normally there'd be people there to direct you to your gate, but half of them decided to call off work and instead get jobs at the local train station.  And you aren't alone. That flight to Aruba is really popular. So popular that almost 200,000 people have gotten off of buses in the last couple days.
But they're just loitering around the airport. The planes are moving but it's a slow process. And not enough employees are gathering people together and moving them where they need to go.  So some of them get 'smart'. They decide that if people pay them a bit more, they'll get priority boarding.  
Well, 200,000 people are angry. The ones that were there the longest are frustrated. "Why are other people getting on while I'm sitting here? they say".  So they go hunt down the unscrupulous employee(s) and pay them some more. And sure enough, they start boarding.  But each time it happens, more people want on NOW, and they become willing to pay more for it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:32:32
You seem to know about asset bubbles. If that's the case, you know that it's not logic that drives prices to the moon - it's emotion. If this isn't a bubble, then it isn't one. If it is, then you know that there's no way to make people believe that the price won't go up forever.  Just gotta wait and see how it all plays out.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:05:35
The trick is realizing what the 650 is (a very short-term high) and not buying there. True, you'd be way ahead today no matter what, but finding an entry point is the different between having $100K and $300K today.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:05:33
Fall in my opinion, but that's because I think there's more sell-side pressure that could be triggered by pre-fork selling.  The fork itself won't be the reason but it will act as a catalyst.  Then again, it could happen immediately after the fork too.  Nobody really knows until they've seen it play out.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:06:46
I see the same. Volume is returning but for now we're still in the same channel after bouncing off the lows. There's signs of a potential breakout though, just gotta find enough buyers with conviction. It's been a bit lacking today in that regard (but also lacking sellers, so the price didn't really move much).
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:19:07
Insane volatility (more than usual, even). I don't want to guess a price because I think at various points we'll be much higher than right now, and at others we'll be much lower.

Not exactly, but kinda. Some levels offer more support, based on chart and order book analysis. For example I don't feel any particular way about 5400 or 5200.

That's a possibility, and I can't refute it.  But my head is telling me that 95% of the explanations are instead rationalizations. People will find more and more as the price declines.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:26:26
There's the breakdown.
I am concerned that we're going to the moon. Unfortunately the moon isn't up right now, it's on the other side of the planet.
Edit: It's been 15 minutes and I may have been wrong. Holding and bouncing here forms a nice W, which normally indicates a quick rise.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:35:32
Well, it's already broken so this is obsolete. But what I'm looking at is strictly the order book. There are some patterns that I noticed last night around 6000 before the sharp dive. They seem to hold true so far. But there are signs that things are changing lately, so the 6000 number isn't as important right now.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:39:39
I think we're going quite a bit lower before things stabilize. I don't expect any ATHs soon. I'm not in BTC or BCH, but there should be some really good buying opportunities in the future. It's just going to take longer than many people believe to get back to that point. I hope that I'm wrong, it's never cool when people lose money.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:22:15
I fear that warnings will be ignored. History repeating itself once again. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:22:46
Nothing we've ever seen before. Sounds familiar. In the dot com days, it was "New economy". Earnings didn't matter, it was something we had never seen before, so the old rules didn't apply. But they did apply - this is something in every bubble. People ALWAYS think that it's different this time. So they come up with more and more, increasingly dubious explanations for why it's different.  And after it's all over? Not a single one has been different. But during the rally stage, no one believes that. It really DOES feel different this time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:20:12
It means the rally will end before we get back to the highs, then most likely turn lower than before the bounce.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:34:15
Those 80% declines after the tops concern you at all?  Even knowing it'll come back it's hard to keep your nerve during times like those.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:03:42
They'll come when we get a strong bounce. No telling when that'll happen of course - but after people know they are in the black they are more likely to want to tell everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:10:24
I don't like being pessimistic, but I feel compelled to go against the grain here. If it falls under 7000, don't blink.  Things will get interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:02:22
The dip from 8200 to 8000? That technically was a dip, I suppose. But not really enough to think much about it.  It's not really "popping" though if you look at GDAX. Selling volume was heavy to take it down to 8000, buying back up to 8100 is very sparse.  Not a *bad* sign exactly but it is one that casts doubt on buying conviction.
A much healthier move would be going back above 8200 on *higher* volume than the decline was.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:08:28
There will be better ones, just hold for a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:12:21
There's a reason for this. It's 2 different groups of people.
While rising, people wanted it to drop to buy more because they trust BTC for the long haul. Those people are still hodling. The people asking "should I sell" are in a different group. Most are new investors with new reddit accounts. It shouldn't be a shock when people fall off a bandwagon as easily as they hopped on it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:51:00
Yes, because most of them didn't actually make any money. Some didn't even have revenue. They got tons of venture capital, had an ipo, burned through everything in a year, then folded.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:50:39
If this is sensible price action i agree with you. If this is a bubble, logic goes out the window. That's part of the definition - the only motivators are euphoric buying or panicked selling.
Remeber that weve run from 3500 to 7000 almost uninterrupted. That point of reentry may be lower than you think. A falling knife has no handle.
Sorry if i sound too pessimistic!
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:24:46
Some big players seem to want to hold things where they are. Big trades on either side show up whenever it looks like we're going to break out. Then activity slows and the trades are canceled for a bit.  I honestly don't know what's next.
Edit: Purely from the charts, we won't be here in 3 hours. If we go up, we go way up. If we go down, likewise. Popcorn time.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:36:05
Hi again, it's time for my daily dose of doom and gloom. People would be well-advised to read up on asset bubbles and how to identify one, there's a plethora of red flags going up in the last 3 days.  This could be a short pullback before we shoot higher, but if it isn't things could turn sour pretty quickly. Not a prediction, just an observation.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:52:06
And 2006. I've actually stopped warning people, I think it just makes their conviction stronger.  I felt the FOMO myself during the rise from 3500 to 7000. It's tough to resist, especially with so many good stories about people getting rich in the news.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:18:36
Shrug. Logic isn't even in play here. People dumping BTC are looking for somewhere else to put it. That's why when the fork was called off, BTC jumped to 7800 - it was people that sold BTX and suddenly had money that they wanted to put to work.
Edit: As for the fud, I'd stop looking. Read a bit about bubbles - the most insignificant news can trigger a selloff.

It's not over, and it wasn't "just" a pump and dump. When people start to sell BTC again, they'll move to BCH. Nothing nefarious about it, it's just people that wanted to get rich here trying to do it somewhere else.

Definitely. But it's not helpful! Plenty of reassurance is to be had here just be reading other new posts. I don't think we need to add more!

It might be a bit wild to think of, but coming from purely reading the 12-month chart, I think there's a shot at about 11000-12000 surprisingly soon.
See the 1yr here: 
Each rally has taken the price to about 60% higher than the previous high. And the time between dips is getting shorter (3 months, 2 months, 5~ weeks).  This is due to the parabolic rise - the slope gets steeper and steeper. When the pattern is broken it tends to not come back, but we haven't broken it yet. Turning above 7800 is great from a fundamental perspective - so if it holds true (the steep rise), we're gonna be flooded with DBZ memes in no time!

Some of us are interpreting the price action differently. Not that it's all doom and gloom, it's just not the way HODLers see things.

You are using a definition of "bubble" that isn't used in economics.  What you're describing is one. You don't need to be afraid of that word, just understand it better.  Here's what economists call a bubble:
"X" starts off small, with early investors getting in for pennies. It gets more and more popular, gains value, corrects a few times, but overall keeps going up.  At some point, this rally can start to greatly speed up, doubling the price in a shorter and shorter period each time.  That happens when buyers flood in and buy at any price. It's "safe" to do this because the buyers expect the price to keep rising.  Now, you can have that happening (people buying because they expect gains) without a bubble forming.  The "bubble" part comes in when the price starts to shoot up so fast that it can't be sustained. So it comes back down, then resumes normalcy.
Your example of copper going up because it's easy to produce somehow making it a bubble has nothing to do with bubbles.  I'm not trying to trash talk or put you down, but I think you would benefit from just reading the wiki article on bubbles.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:11:14
I look at it a tiny bit differently. Bitcoin does this insane "Run 10000% higher, then crash" pattern. After the crash the price bottoms out and then starts rising again. I prefer to count from that low - as soon as a rally begins to form that's bullish enough for me.  Bitcoin loves to spike to the moon at the end of these rallies - so it's not so much the 80% loss that I'm worried about (it'll come back, or at least it has so far) but rather the feeling that you could have been 5 times richer if you had some patience.

A bot, most certainly. Some institutional firm is active lately. Actually, many are, and it's been that way for several months now. Too many odd patterns popping up for it to be actual humans trading.  It's amusing to me that they won't actually admit this - you have people like Dimon saying "It's a scam!" while he knows damn well his employees are using it to make money.
I misinterpreted your initial post when I read "whale" - which to me implies someone like Bruno Iksil, dealing in the billions.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:45:44
There will be sharp selling, followed by a bounce. The bounce will rally BTC 10-20% from wherever it happens, then it'll turn south again.  To time any of this is impossible.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:06:03
It's a trigger but not the reason. The reason is waaaay more detailed. Just know that anything minor could have caused this. It was almost inevitable.

So I've been going on about the dreaded "b"-word for awhile (since I've studied them pretty deeply and saw some warning signs). No matter how bad the news turns in the short-term, there really is a light at the end of the tunnel. The end result, almost every time, is that the asset eventually isn't hated and can even be embraced again.  BTC will have time to sort out its problems.

I'm not one for chart analysis, but as charts go I have to say...

It's a tough pill to swallow if you are long BTC. The more get-rich-quick newbies, the higher the risk of the price crashing when they all flee.  Some people prefer to believe that these newbies don't exist.

Preventing panic selling! That's a problem that countless people have tried to solve, but alas, it hasn't been done (sustainably at least).  Once psychology takes over, people will act irrationally. That's not a shot taken at people here, it's just a general remark. A small decline can trigger a panic and a crash if conditions are right.  
Selling isn't a good call during "just a dip", you're 100% right.  But the people doing the selling aren't guaranteed to make the right call. In fact, as prices fall, more and more make the wrong call.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:45:01
Fair enough. So what I'll do is delete it. It probably won't have any impact either way, but I kinda get part of what you're saying. I don't want to contribute negatively.
3-year holders aren't jumping at all IMO. The guys that bought between 4000 and 6000 are the ones I'm thinking about. The HODL mentality hasn't really taken hold for them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:51:20
Yes, it's advised if you're in it for the long haul. Trust no exchanges.

The order book looks bad. If the sellers actually sell, the price is about to fall off a cliff.
I am not trying to spread fear, simply inform.
Edit: 20 minutes later it looks much healthier! Good support at 6340, possible short-term entry.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:10:08
Bounce back? There will be minor bounces (say, down to 6500, back to 6800. Down to 6200, back to 6600 as declines progress). The next REALLY big bounce will happen in the 5000-5500 area, but it'll be temporary. I don't think we'll bounce to all-time highs for awhile.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:15:23
That's a good point, and it's probably inevitable given how this technology works.  But it definitely does cast doubt on the results of any polls conducted at this time.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:39:23
The fact that so many people are saying that it is a great investment, and that it'll always go up is a red flag. The fact that people are beginning to suggest borrowing money to buy in is also a red flag. And the droves of people telling us why this time it's different and it isn't a bubble is a red flag.  It's just too risky right now. Those 3 things happened in every historical bubble that I can think of.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:02:29
There's a guarantee of increased volume and volatility, that's about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:34:30
People have been buying since 1000 or even less. They will take profits at some point. Even if they think the price has further to rise, it's still sensible to take a bit off the top.  
People buying for short-term gains. Say you bought at 7500 and it went to 8200. Now it's at 8200. It's been there for a few days. But you look at ETH and BCH and see them up 10%! If you bought BTC for quick gains you will want to sell your BTC and move to an alt that is rising quickly, chasing those gains.  (Pro tip: This is normally a losing proposition, but newbies will do it anyway).
People that think we're at a top. There are always some - if you believe this is a top, then of course you'd sell!
What's not doing it? HODLers that want to sell to buy back at a lower price.  This is given as a reason by many people when they sell, but it's just a rationalization to deal with the fact that they said they'd hodl forever.  They may or may not get back in, but most won't.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:18:17
This does not exclude it from being speculated on, which is the only requirement for what you're saying is impossible for bitcoin.  So many rationalizations lately about why this can't be a bubble. I don't get why people care so much to tell everyone! If they are 100% certain, then it won't matter in the end.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:14:36
Good choice. Move those coins first, then decide from there. Why are you looking to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:57:35
I hope I'm not alone in thinking that this is actually a bad sign. "Everyone go out and buy this thing that you know  nothing about even though you've never invested" isn't good advice.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:01:21

I don't see this as great news, but it probably won't be bad either. Most viewers of that show won't understand enough to buy in. The ones that do? Well, they'll just be part of the rapid influx of new "investors" looking for a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:14:59
Zoom out and you see a chart that looks like hundreds of bubbles before this one.  Don't be blinded by emotion.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:02:34
I know you mean well, but historically speaking, do you know one of the best bubble indicators is? People rationalizing high prices by saying "this time is different!".  Every bubble has that aspect - something specific unique to the new asset makes it immune.  In the end it almost always isn't immune.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:59:05
10% is what they used to say about gold. I think BTC is being seen similarly, a hedge against everything else going to shit.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:52:34
This isn't a comment for you specifically, but it's something I want to point out.  We're going to see LOTS more comments like this in the near future.  We're past the point of only newbies panicking and selling (they all came in above 7000 anyway), and now it's late-entry HODLers getting fearful.  Since they want to HODL forever (but don't), the reasoning is "I'll buy back in later" or "I'm still holding most of it". 
It's so damned predictable how this is playing out. My apologies to any people losing money.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:23:36
There's no reason to think that they'll just hold the bitcoin for themselves, they'll be spending it just like the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:30:17
In theory, the value of BTC+BCH after the fork would be the same as the value of BTC before the fork. So it wouldn't be free - at least not right off the bat. 
But once you have 2 assets, the market can value them independently and the end result MAY be a higher overall value.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:55:49
I'm not bothered by it. But thank you for your comment.

During the gaps up and down on gdax we're 30 handles wide, I've never seen that. This is nuts.

@_date: 2017-11-12 06:06:14
For me there's no humorous aspect to it. It's instead a fascination with the events going down. You can read things like this in a book or watch a movie, but to see the psychology behind it first-hand is something else.

I get that, and I feel the same way. I want to get in for the long haul.  But if I think I'm going to have a better entry point I'm going to wait.  No one knows what a fair value is right now. But we've run up way too quickly for my liking. The last time BTC ran like this, it hit 240 then crashed to 70.  People said the same thing then, that 240 was nothing compared to the potential.  But careful in claiming that fair value doesn't even matter - that's dotcom bubble logic!
And they are right in terms of the future, but the path toward the inevitable endgame for BTC can still be full of volatile spikes and crashes.

Little consolation to people that bought above 6000 (I'm not one of them, just saying). Also, take caution when zooming out. It's risky to assume that the future of the chart will follow the same pattern.

I don't know this for sure, but not getting back to the high (7500 - 7800, depending on if you count 1 anomalous gigantic trade) would scare me. Almost every chart that's looked like this one so far (a big rally, a few corrections along the way, then a spike to an ATH, and finally a selloff) ended up much lower if the ATH wasn't at least tested during the next peak.  If the highs are broken, then it's a totally different story. 
Rally and don't get back to the ATH: [Nasdaq Chart](
Now there are some counterexamples, like [Walmart](
So it's anyone's guess what happens next. All we know is that it'll be volatile.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:19:18
This is going to be "tricky" to play right. They say that the contracts will be based off a once-a-day spot price aggregate, which is ok for commodities, ok for stocks, but bad for cryptocurrencies. They simply fluctuate too much intraday. And when the REAL price disconnects from the futures price, the market tends to break down technically.  I think this is a bad move overall. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:55:45
Bitcoin is effectively splitting into 2. One will be bitcoin, the other is going by the name B2X (for now). Without understanding blockchain you won't understand why it's doing this. But in short, after the fork you'll have your .3BTC or whatever you bought AND .3BTX. You'll be able to split that BTX into a separate wallet and sell it/convert it to BTC if you wish. That's what most here are doing.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:23:03

That's actually a really tough question. I don't think $1K is possible barring Bitcoin actually dying, permanently.  I don't think $20K will happen for a long time, if it even does.  Both are long shots IMO, but I'd say 20K if I had to give 1 answer.

@_date: 2018-02-02 08:40:47
There's a really big sell mountain there. - like 4000 coins between here and $8000. I've seen 500s-1000s get taken down, but this will be a challenge. It is slowly shrinking though, so gotta keep watch.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:36:19
Yes, but no as well? It's more complicated.  The ultimate dip doesn't come all at once. Like, there's almost 0 chance that we just crash to 2000 without stopping anywhere along the way.  If we did, then FOMO would get tons of buyers in on the dip.  
But if we go to 8000, then 8500, then 7000, then 8000, then 6500 then 7000 then 5500... and so on, going up and down while declining, the dips begin to wear on investors. By the time the last one happens no one will want to buy.  Just put yourself in those shoes:
"OMG! Ultimate Dip! Buying opportunity of a lifetime!" -&gt; Price doesn't rise as much as you want -&gt; Another dip -&gt; repeat.  After several times of thinking that you won the Bitcoin lottery and realizing you didn't you'll want out.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:12:59

@_date: 2018-02-02 06:38:56
This is a good time to make a note about bounces - we're very likely to have one because of the massive mountain (it's more than a wall).  It's just too many orders to get through.  But watch after the bounce - the walls often clear out afterward as people cancel their orders out of concern for further declines - ironically speeding up those declines.
If we do break through it'll be under unprecedented volume - GDAX will probably break.  The recent trade history will be full of 50+ coin sales.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:10:01
I think you're overestimating the buyers. But you are right, going down too far too fast will result in a big bounce afterward (just like this morning).  But those buyers might take some time getting involved and the drop could be bigger than you expect.

Disappointment and grass is greener in what way? That could be very rational if you're continually evaluating your investments.  If you're disciplined that's great. I totally agree that doing things at the wrong time will cause you to buy high and sell low. But I see that as under the "emotional trading" umbrella, which includes fear and greed. Those are extreme examples of emotions so they only manifest when dealing with large price moves or with large investment amounts. 
I don't believe there's been anything that started under a penny and rose to $20K in what, 8 years? This is an order of magnitude greater than any boom that history has ever seen.  It's so unprecedented that even the word 'unprecedented' doesn't do it justice. The baseline doesn't exist yet for Bitcoin since the big rally started before it had much utility in the real world.  Now it has that utility - but how much?  Does it support the price increase?  
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:20:51
"Bitcoin has strong support around 9800" because "That's just how Bitcoin is" and "I don't think it can drop any more"?

Most people bought because they wanted money though. You bought because you understand, trust, and love the tech. But you aren't selling right now - the people that flocked here for easy money are.  
And I think Bitcoin (all crypto really) has changed. You just (from my POV) will not let yourself see it.

That's cool, but it really comes off differently. It looks like the hundreds of people who want to convince people to buy to get the price up. That may not have been your intent.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:50:31
It's the start of one, I agree.   The massive rally and &gt;50% drop was the beginning, but there are still investors that remained bullish. For them, it definitely hasn't popped.  For that reason I think of the final downturn that completely flips sentiment as the "pop".  It can happen days, weeks, or even months from the ATH.

Belfort did not call Bitcoin a scam. The rest I can't speak to, but watch what he said again: 
In short, Bitcoin is not a scam. People however will use the success of Bitcoin to create their own scams. Blockchain is world-changing. But the current environment with no regulation lends itself to massive pump and dump schemes that are extremely dangerous to the retail investor.

So my rebuttal is this.  You can't separate the noobs who wanted to get rich quick from the smart early investors because the price action caused by those noobs eventually impacts even the earliest people to get in.  It's easy to be a strong hand if you bought at 5000 and we're still way above 5000. But as the price falls, those hands get weak. It's just what happens, and I know it sounds like a cop-out and that I'm not giving details, but when speculative booms end it always plays out the same way.
The "FUD" stuff is true, but again, it impacts everyone, not just noobs. You and I can look at random silly news and say "That has 0 impact on Bitcoin!" and we'd be right. But the noobs that bought at 15K will panic - the FUD will be real news to them.  And while it's not news to us, a tanking price is.  So you can hate the FUD but it's having a real impact and we cannot prevent that impact from hurting investors.
Finally, the bull case:


So the tech is improving rapidly. If the price growth was linked to adoption and tech then there would be good reason to buy now - the speed concerns are going away, the mempool stuff, etc.  But like my last point, that's not why the price got so high in the first place. It was speculation! And once that dies off it becomes clear that tech and adoption aren't as important as some of us thought.
It's just too much wishful thinking in the face of really strong evidence to the contrary.

If you're dabbling in small amounts or actively trading it makes sense to keep it on an exchange.  If you have a bit more, you'll want your own mobile wallet. If you have lots more, you'll want a hardware wallet.

It's pretty much just general fear, people start losing money and want out so the price falls. But when the price has gone up so far so quickly there's lots of room to drop. I go back to my last comment - the FUD matters to the people that bought at the top. Earlier investors brush it off.  It becomes a pure price thing - and each drop scares more people out.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:29:07


I believe you should reconsider your position here.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:54:45
That would be bad for Bitcoin I think. Imagine if exchanges halted due to a 5% drop, say for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes what happens? You have tons of people that wanted to sell after the 5% but couldn't. When trading resumes they'll all immediately sell so they get their orders processed before the next trading curb.  It would be a bloodbath.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:30:06
Does it soften the blow of seeing bitcoin as a bubble if you tell yourself that everything else is as well?  Because BTC rose 1000% then fell 60%. The Dow Jones rose 30% and fell 2.5% in the same time. It's just not anywhere near the same thing. Bubbles have very specific dynamics and most of the things that you may think are, aren't.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:41:34
What strikes me is that in most investments, a 10% move back and forth this rapidly would be considered volatility, but for Bitcoin it's... well, boring?

Bitcoin comes out and is worth pennies. "A" investors get in just for fun. Price goes up. "B" investors start to notice. It's still small though, and "B" are guys and gals like us. We're more tech-savvy than most, and indeed "A" and "B" are all pretty much nerds or very smart investors.  Price goes up faster and faster and faster, and media catches on.
"C" investors like your cousin or coworker start to get interested. And "C" dwarfs "A" and "B" in size. Banks and rich investors buy in but don't tell anyone they are doing so. "C" investors see a chance to get rich as the price skyrockets. Now it's all over the news, Big Bang Theory, social media - everyone at least has heard of it.  Futures start trading, bringing HUGE money in.  The price goes vertical and soars.
But you can't go vertical forever, so it literally cannot stay up - it has to come down at some point.  This was the 10K-&gt;20K-&gt;15K part. "D" investors start to buy the post-20K dip and do really well in the short term recovery.  Meanwhile, big money is selling little bits at a time, with BTC being held by an increasingly large number of average Joes.
Then something happens. Some FUD, some real news, whatever. It causes a decent drop. Most people don't care, but those "D"s? They just got in so all they've seen is the price go up a bit and then right back down.  "This is stupid, it doesn't stay up!". So "D"s sell. The price falls.
Eventually the price gets to where the "C"s bought in.  And now they are the ones getting a bit scared. So they start to sell. 
And you can see how it plays out from there. Every drop moves more people from the "HODL" bucket to the "Shit I'm bailing!" bucket.  It then cascades downward. And that's where we are right now.
Sorry for the length but hopefully it's easy to understand. Note that I didn't detail any specific news that causes the "D"s to sell. That news doesn't matter to anyone else. But the falling price? That becomes the "news" that the "C"s worry about.  And so on.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:41:09

They are 2 totally different things, and you're showing a tremendous lack of knowledge in this area.
Past Performance is not a guarantee of future results refers to predicting future prices based on prior price action. You cannot say "Bitcoin goes up after every dip" and use that to conclude that it always will.
When you look at the pattern of a bubble (not the prices, the pattern), you can extrapolate from it.  We've gone through the discovery, growth, boom, and mania phases of a bubble. We've even gone through the first half of the final phase. This is different from predicting prices. 
But you'll find this out soon if you're holding a bag. And you don't even need to come back to me and say "you were right" after you panic sell!
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:02:56
You are likely mistaking a lack of trading activity for stability. Stable would imply that as the price moves, a significant number of traders step in and well... trade!  What we're seeing now is just extremely low volume. There aren't enough traders doing anything to move the price.  For now it looks the same, but should bulls or bears decide to act, it'll lead to a large price movement in lieu of a counterbalancing set of traders.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:41:20
It means that most of the bullish bargain hunters have been given pause.  "Buy now because it's going back up!" is being replaced by "Why not wait for a bottom first?".  
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:41:15
It does not happen every year.  I mean, a 1000% increase, finishing with a 100% boom in 2 weeks, followed by a crash back to 10000, then volatility on the way down.  The prior times did not have the wild media frenzy, they didn't have the FOMO, they didn't have futures trading, and waaaay more.  It's just not the same situation.  
IF you'd humor me, please look at a 1-year BTC chart. coinbase/worldcoin/whatever you prefer. Note the huge spike, dip, rebound, then decline. It's like a hill with 2 peaks, or a tuning fork, or an Eye of Sauron without the actual eye.  Find any chart of any asset at any time that looks like that but recovers quickly - basically, one that looks like our 1-year that gets back to the ATH within months.

@_date: 2018-02-02 22:11:36
I think we're in agreement for the most part then.  Although I think now there's an overriding factor that makes prior TA moot. Namely, the chart shows an exponential boom, then 2 peaks, then an exponential decay. You know as well as I what that shape means.
Bitcoin will take its time with consolidation, and after the bad blood is gone it can stage a comeback. The technology will be better, adoption will recover, and it'll just be all-around good for Bitcoin.  But that can't happen until the speculative cycle is complete.  But again, it means nothing for the infrastructure or the tech. It's just a speculative thing coming to an end. A pure price play.


I'm not so sure of this one. The last booms were just guys like us. But now it's all of retail involved. It's banks, hedge funds, rich foreigners. That's a brand new dynamic that exacerbates volatility.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:52:47
That's exactly what happens during the boom, and why people say "It's a bubble! This is the top!" repeatedly and are repeatedly wrong. I did it myself at 8000. This is not the same market now. How many times did we dip on the way and up recover immediately? This has been like... 7 dips, and we're now lower than all but the last one. And the next dip could blow that last low out too.  
Edit: Reply to your edit: It's going to blow out so many people on the way down, and each drop will take hodlers and make them panic. The "strong hands" turn weak every time. All it takes is price levels to get blown out and put more people into the red.  The use cases had nothing to do with the run to 20K - it was speculation and people wanting to get rich. New use cases aren't getting those people back.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:24:24
If this is a bubble then you are making a big mistake. If. What happens in bubbles is that people use the past prices and extrapolate from there, ignoring all other metrics. This fuels the rally by getting people to feel confident in buying dips.  When sentiment changes, the price falls like a rock.
If. It's no mystery where I stand. I say it's a bubble.  If it's not then I'm totally wrong and bitcoin will continue to come back stronger each time.
Just some info and food for thought.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:36:32
Bitcoin does the job of being money better than fiat by a wide margin.  But to replace fiat is a gargantuan task.  It could happen but Bitcoin isn't some ordained entity that will inevitably take every role - humans need to make that happen. And that factor puts up so many roadblocks as to make it extremely unlikely.
The same is true of gold. Bitcoin can do the job but it's not going to just take that role because it can.  I think this side is more likely though, at least for people that understand the tech. But that physical coin in your hand really is a big appeal for many people, so I don't know what percentage would buy in.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:04:31
It's something that repeats itself over and over again throughout history. First a new tech comes out, then it gains popularity, then it goes mainstream and the price skyrockets.  Once the price starts coming back down, the institutional investors that got in when popularity was rising know to get out because they've seen it before. But first-time investors haven't - they'll consider it a great buying opportunity. 
So I'm not 100% sure by any means, but when this fits a predictable pattern so well it's difficult to overlook.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:03:47
Definitely, so many people sold the dips on the way up and lost out big time. Like the downturn, it's just not possible to predict how high something can go.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:12:15
So yeah, many people called the top incorrectly. It's tough to do in a bubble, since every little pullback looks like a top. But you have to be willingly blind to not see the writing on the wall right now. Because people were wrong before doesn't mean you can dismiss the entire idea.  You're still thinking that this thing can rise exponentially and never come down. That's never happened and it won't happen here either.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:50:44
Oh yeah, totally agree there. But the dow is still running up. That may change very soon though. I expect it to at least
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:41:53
It should be taken as a compliment! You're intelligent and well-read clearly but it all came off as a bit condescending to me.  I have no qualms about realizing Bitcoin's potential. It could have a future, without going into details. But now the price has nothing to do with that. It's wild speculation. I don't know where Bitcoin will be in 10 years, but I've got a good idea where it will be in 10 months.  
Saying that "it will collapse, like all monies do" though is setting up a false equivalency. Bitcoin's price won't collapse because it's a form of money, it'll collapse because of speculation - a short-term collapse I might add.  It's not money right now, it's an asset. It's like a stock, or an MBS, or Tulip futures.  
I apologize for talking down to you there at the end of my comment. I'm an ass sometimes.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:11:11
They are real, but they don't last. Too many "whales" as they are called here want out, but they can't get out all at once without crashing the price. So they wait until we hit an apparent wall so their selling doesn't immediately tank it.  This also happens in reverse during rallies.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:32:52

It's a trade-off IMO. You get trustless transactions that can't be forged, but you get more responsibility along with it.  I can see people having a problem though, so it's good to consider. I'm not sure if there's any work to resolve this potential issue but it's pretty interesting to think about.

My call from yesterday of a slow price decline has panned out thus far. Volume has become even lighter until the last few hours, stabilizing things around 9400.  If the volume breaks down again, I expect more declines until 8500-8800.  This could happen rather quickly but it's still more likely to be a bleed rather than a sharp drop.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:10:21
Several more steps downward, but eventually (probably within a year or so) we'll hit a bottom. Actually, it's likely that we'll shoot past what a "fair" bottom should be, meaning a quick rebound will be waiting for the brave souls that want to trade it.  95% of people will call this bottom incorrectly.   I have no idea what dollar value this will happen at.
Then, it'll take a couple years of reconsolidation, with ups and downs, and eventually we'll be back to a similar situation as early 2017, when a rally starts up again.  This assumes no new regulations though, and that's really looking more and more likely as time goes on.  So beyond say, 6 months, I don't trust my own calls.

Word to the wise about these bounces. Historically there are many of them along the way down. Assuming that any one is a bottom is very risky, and you'll probably guess wrong if you try to do so.  The sellers are here - and while buyers can get in and shoot the price up quickly, there simply aren't enough of them that want in. Once they stop buying the price just goes right back where it was.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:18:30
I don't think it's really the same thing, since the equity had really been growing since inception. It's just that the public couldn't price it yet.  So the boom from the IPO onward can be tracked (and some are pretty tremendous as you noted), but you can't go any further back in time than that.  But say you could get in that early and price the equity out. That would make you a venture capitalist in a way, and could give you those gargantuan returns. 
For most of us, that won't happen. So you're comparing a 1000% increase to a 5,000,000% one.  You could have bought Bitcoin at $0.00003 in early 2010, unlike getting in the ground floor of a company.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:06:43
In my defense, I said what I believed was going to happen today.  Yes, it's a continuation of yesterday, but it doesn't mean that I'm only saying what the price is currently doing. If I expect a reversal I'll say so. But now my personal opinion is that it won't change today.  We disagree, and I think we can agree to disagree.  Present your points and let people believe what they want to.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:39:23
Because it's a temporary bounce and big money knows it. With all likelihood the 600 buck gain wasn't really buying at all. It was short covering - something that traders were forced into doing by market forces.  It's called a "squeeze" - it's also what happened when we went from 10K to 20K in a week.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:01:28
Similarly, "correction" is a brief downturn in a bull market. It will be rallied out of quickly as selling pressure subsides.  Our problem now isn't temporary selling pressure, it's that minutes go by without any real buyers. Don't take much to get the price to tank at times like this.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:28:11

It's overdue for sure. We don't even see corrections lately. Just a slowly steepening exponential curve.  That's a sign of trouble.  The gains until 2015 had bumps along the way. I fear that easy money and low interest rates are kicking off a... Yes, a bubble.

Definitely, that's pretty much my stance.  The current prices are not sustainable but the tech is a game changer.
Most of my comments are trying to get people to see their bad reasoning as to why this isn't a bubble.  They will lose their money and some will have their lives ruined.  I've seen the same reasons at 18k, 16k, 14k, all the way to 8k. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:23:21

I was watching it live on gdax.  2am thru 6am or so yesterday.  After the dive you're right, there was a ton of buying. We are looking at the same data but at different times. Our interpretations aren't really whats different.  The drop of 750 bucks down to 7500 was all massive selling volume.

You can look at historical examples of other things that traded like Bitcoin has to get some guidance. But each one is different in scale, where the dips are, how low it gets, etc.  In general, imagine a ball bouncing down a flight of stairs. A drop, a bounce, a drop, a bounce, and repeat some number of times. Each drop is lower, each bounce is lower.  But there's no way to predict how many times it'll do it before bottoming or where that bottom is.
A thing to look for is sentiment.  Each drop will make more and more people disgusted.  And by the bottom, almost everyone that lost money will hate Bitcoin with a passion.  When that happens it's probably very near the bottom.  But future after that? That's in the air. We'll be back at a stable price at least, so a bull market can pick up again. And unlike now, the price really *will* go up as utility rises, and Bitcoin can begin a new future.
Once again, this is just looking at History. Bitcoin will fit lots of it but not all.

Honest question. Why is this rebuttal given when someone simply makes a negative comment? Can't someone share their opinion without being told "well shut up and short it then!"?
Person A: "It's going to be nice this weekend. I think I'll go for a bike ride!"
Person B: "I don't know, I heard there was snow and sleet in the forecast."
Person A: "Well then go buy a hat and a parka and skis and a dump truck with a snow plow on it!!"
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:04:37
That was very true on the way up, and you're right that a few good days will get people back in. But they won't last if there's another drop, mainly because this drop will be fresh in their minds.

The downside is that we'll both miss a giant rally if one starts up. That's the way it goes!
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:25:17
The bear is optimistic today! At 8am volume broke in the positive direction, and while it hasn't been sustained, there also hasn't been strong selling into the rally.  I think this is a good opportunity to trade in the 9300 to 11500 range. Moving outside of it would be an indication that a new trend is forming.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:06:59
"Bitcoin has always recovered from dips, therefore it will always recover from dips".  The people buying  expect it to get back to the ATH pretty soon.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:13:53
I mostly agree, although I think that most people that bought to hodl aren't really concerned with bear market vs bull market, sentiment and all.  For most, every drop is a dip - because that's all Bitcoin ever did - dip and recover.  For that class of investors what matters the most is "Am I still profitable?". 
TA is voodoo in general. But it's harmless and somewhat useful to use as a guideline for forming some better conclusions.   But trading purely off of it? You just lose doing that in the long run. Bad EV.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:57:57
I am not saying that it is. But going purely by the chart, it looks 100% identical to most historical bubbles. It was "pricked" at 20K (the dive to 10K and back to 17K being the fallout). The "pop" is the last leg down, which - *if this is a Bubble* - will occur next.
Just sayin.

If you attribute every increase to the law and every decrease to random fluctuation, that's a bias. That's all I mean.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:05:12
lol, you really could! But you'd need to make sure the gains are random. Any pattern in wins makes a game far less addictive.  That includes always winning. Buying during a boom and making money is awesome and fun, but a few losses in a row can break the pattern. But random wins mixed in with the losses? Gotta keep chasing the rush!  So I guess... buying during dips is more addictive. And dangerous!
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:48:09
20.5K is my target first. Then 17-18K - but I think it could keep rallying for awhile first. Too much momentum coupled with optimism based on tax reform and deregulation.

Was it really? Serious Q, because I only have a high-level understanding of Tether. It sounded very sketchy to me though, so I can understand why it could set off real panic.
My big point through all of this is that the piece of news that breaks the camel's back doesn't much matter.  When a market is ready to panic, it's gonna panic - it just needs that catalyst. It could easily have been China, or regulations in the USA, or Facebook banning crypto pump and dump ads, etc.

I was at a car show last week and saw some Fiats (the automobile that is). Buying a Fiat with Bitcoin that you bought with Fiat would make for a neat tongue-twister. But sadly they didn't accept any crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:32:55
Probably joking, but no, we cannot. Once the momentum changes there's no going back for some time.  You could try with an altcoin maybe, but they'll crash too.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:55:07
If you're into some crude TA you can make some educated support level guesses based on the run-up.  As the price falls it's normally the people that just saw their investment go into the red that sell - meaning they bought during the boom. So if you find places on the way up where the price hesitated for a bit you can assume that more people were taking long positions during that time.
That would mean: 6500, 4000, 2500 - but there can be lots of variance around each one.  And of course, there's absolutely no guarantee any of this will happen.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:58:59
Don't look too deeply for one. Low float, low volume. 1 guy with 30 million dollars can move the price this much. It's unlikely that there was a single trigger for it.

So I just saw a video from the Wolf of Wall Street, and he pretty much called everything from December on. It's not what buyers will want to watch, but if you're curious give it a listen.
The rally, the giant spike from 10K to 20K, the pump and dumps in altcoins, the downturn, the sentiment going to shit, and BTC cratering.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:51:58
It's weird if you assumed that the price rising had anything to do with technology, adoption, dubious-s-curves, etc.  But if you instead assume that it was a big speculative run-up, it makes perfect sense that it would come back down unimpeded by good technological news.  
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:56:20
Very well said. I'm on the same page as you, with the exception of what I believe you believe about Bitcoin. In my opinion it's unproven, and will bring with it solutions while creating additional unforeseen problems. It's too young IMO to praise it, heralding it as our savior from debt-based money.

There's really nothing to bite. I did the prognostication thing 
 here before and I've found it's not really the place for it.  And it's vague anyway, no numbers or anything. Just patterns.

@_date: 2018-02-25 23:04:03
That's alright, but from my point of view there is a basis. And it's not something that I can summarize in a few sentences - it's based on my experiences investing in different things over the years.  I could be totally wrong or totally right or somewhere in between.  That's what this thread is for though, right? Speculation, guessing, analysis, hoping, praying, whatever else we see it as.  You don't seem to have much problem when people make bullish predictions though. So from my point of view you're just lashing out at people like me that are bearish.  That's the only part that really bothers me about our interactions.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:22:41
You can't predict prices, but you can predict patterns. And this is one that is well-documented and has a long history. But you're right that the only way to know for sure is to wait.  But... that's kinda just sticking your head in the sand in a way. If there is any indication at all that the price will go up or down and that indication is a solid one, it's a bad idea to ignore it. Use it as a guide, not as a firm rule though. Nothing is ever a sure thing.

I still love your site, but I disagree with your predictions. The mood has changed, and Bitcoin won't be the same this year.  I also think your timelines for recovery are too aggressive - even in Bitcoin's past it's taken 2-3 years after large drops to fully recover. What do you se being different about this one?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:28:05
That's actually really cool that you're interested. Blockchain has a serious future, and I'm sure you know lots about Bitcoin. It's just that the part that you're getting wrong has to do with Bitcoin as an asset traded on an open market. It's subject to all of the nasty things that stocks/bonds/forex have but 100x worse.  So where your analysis is dubious is in price level predictions. Anyway, sorry if I came off too harsh.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:51:40
It was being largely offset by lots of buying back then. This time there are fewer buyers, so one - volume is lower, and two - it takes fewer sell orders to move the price down.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:59:29
This is not a dip that can be taken as a bump in the road toward the moon. It is driven by very different forces, and could take much longer to recover from. Buying now is a large risk as I see it, probably more so than any time in Bitcoin's history.   
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:21:01

Not really imo. No sellers isn't the same as support. We need selling that gets offset by buying, that'll be a sign of a potential bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:50:12
Sounds good buddy.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:58:48
Price is gonna bleed slowly under low volume down to the 8500ish range, plus or minus a few hundred bucks.  The low volume is a bad sign - even with the sell side of the order book looking as thin as a North Korean political prisoner, there aren't enough buyers interested at these levels to recoup the recent losses.
After that, maybe some bounces, but we'll have to see. I'm an uberbear at the moment, so take any of my doomsday predictions with a grain of salt. But if 8000 doesn't hold, then 6000 won't hold either, and the price is going to sprint headlong into the abyss. Personal opinion, of course.
Edit for some math! There is a guy in this thread that claims that he could buy 10 Lambos. Google tells me that 1 is $200K or so. So with that $2 million, combined with the aforementioned paltry order book, there is a man reading this right now that could single-handedly go onto GDAX and boost the price of 1 coin from $9620 to $9900.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:20:04
Bitcoin soars: "The price is going up! To the moon! We're all rich! Lambos for all!"
Bitcoin plunges: "... but price doesn't matter, REAL value is..."... etc.
"FUD" is the_bitcoin's version of "Fake News". 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:20:26
Well said.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:34:04
The buyers weren't the ones initiating the trades. You could see which side of the order book was being chipped away.  Buyers can only consume from the ask side, and that side wasn't moving.

These things have many false bottoms on the way down. Even if it spikes wildly I would not read it as a sign that the bottom has happened.  And there's a very high chance that it'll take longer than anyone thinks. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:51:11
To move down $100 takes a bunch of selling. To recover that $100 takes almost no buying. The price looks stable at times but each up and down wears more and more on the order book.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:33:10
If anything can do it, Bitcoin can! But it would be very temporary and caused by a historically low float. After tanking, the order book would suddenly balloon and the price would come rocketing back.  It would look like the 2010 Flash Crash.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:53:47
Atrocious idea.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:49:26
Bleeding. Several more "dips", but they'll be less and less severe and take longer to get through. In general, expect lower highs and lower lows - but I don't think it's possible to predict exact values.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:18:06
People with money will always try to manipulate markets. They'll do this despite any regulations telling them that they can't. And Bitcoin has no regulations whatsoever. So it's a pretty good bet that almost every institutional trader is manipulating various cryptocurrencies to varying degrees of success.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:16:20
I don't do technically analysis, it's overhyped.  I'm not trying to bullshit like that either.  At 16k people gave reasons for why we wouldn't fall further.  The exact same reasons were given at 15, 14... Even 8k.  I'm going to comment on those kinds of posts because I know the logic is flawed.  
How would you react if I came here and disclosed a large short position (with proof) and talked about how bitcoin was going to crash?  Would you be ok with that because the words would have conviction? Because I've seen people do that - and the responses are overwhelmingly hostile.  So from what I've seen, putting one's money where one's mouth is doesn't change matters. The reality is that longs tend to be hostile either way.  That tells me that what triggers longs is the comment itself implying bitcoin will fall. Skin in the game or not, the responses are the same.
Edit: may as well say it. I am short bitcoin related and blockchain related equities.  Shorting the coin itself is too dangerous and flat out a terrible idea.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:37:09
At some point you'll realize that cause of the dip really doesn't matter at all, and that this was going to happen regardless of what news triggered it.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:19:29
This is bogus to the max. Unless you believe that people have fled Bitcoin en masse from 20K to 9.5K.  It's gotta work both ways.  Otherwise it's pure selection bias - only counting the times when the law seems to "work".
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:49:40
There's no need to make it so personal. If you don't agree with my opinion, ignore it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:31:25
If this is a bubble, then this is relevant. If it's not then ignore all of it.
When an asset goes up and always recovers from dips and the value soars, a repeated pattern of wins enamors investors. They begin to adopt the belief that future price performance can be extrapolated from past results.  This is counter to all investing knowledge - you never assume that past performance is a guarantee of future results.  In a bubble, there's always this point where sentiment flips and the rules change. We've gone through several dips already, and the recovery has led to a deeper dip.  This pattern can continue for longer than investors believe. This is borne out time and time again throughout history. The price levels differ but the pattern is extremely predictable. And we're so far following it.
Please be warned. You can flame me or downvote me or call me a shill, or tell me "short it then!" or whatever. That's not relevant.  I think assuming that a recovery to the all-time high will happen is phenomenally risky.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:17:48

You should know something about historical bubbles.
Every last one was 'different'. Something new. Something that the rules didn't apply to. For various reasons of course - but every time people make the same mistakes.  Bitcoin is not guaranteed to go up and up and up because "this time it's different!".  All of the reasons why it can't possibly go down are rationalizations.  That's just the way it is.
So I'm not here to trash Bitcoin or anything, but it's very obvious that tons of people are scared to death and lashing out right now.  That feeling sucks, doesn't it?

1099s aren't hard! Just keep good records and taxes won't be a problem.  You'll have to pay cap gains on it someday eventually anyway. And I agree, if you are really that long-term, then none of this concerns you.  But it could be a long time, and selling + rebuying might be a better plan.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:08:04
I wish I knew more about psychology, because you're totally right and it fascinates me.  We always hold out, believing that it'll get back at least to where we bought in at.  Same with gains, really. If I buy at 1 and it goes to 2, I'll watch 1.90... 1.80.... 1.70.... all the while thinking "It was at 2, I'll let it get back there and sell!".   Took me lots of practice and discipline to be able to cut my losses.

This is another way of saying that this specific asset is different than the hundreds of others in the past that soared and then crashed, because it was truly revolutionary. But what you may not be considering is that every single time that's been the case.  Every single bubble has it. People invariably come up with reasons why theirs is "different". And we're still waiting on that one that is.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:54:18
So true. Every time an asset does this, it's always a dinky little thing that triggers the tumble.  Once a small number of people get scared and sell, the price falls a bit. Everything past that isn't about the news at all - it's people selling because of the "news" that BTC is down. And it just cascades from there.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:56:31
It's very risky just shoring any of them for sure. Before BTC bottoms most alts will be completely dead. Some will go through insane pump and dumps fueled by money made with Bitcoin. But those will have the same fate in the end. Only a few will survive - the ones with real utility right now.

The price would not move. But what you're asking is impossible. You literally cannot get everyone to agree to that. Because they all feel anxious and nervous like you do.  And that feeling gets worse and worse and makes people crack.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:53:48
I don't agree with that last part. Bitcoin goes down for 2 days, there's nothing there that implies that it'll keep going down beyond those 2 days. I'm not going back to edit my predictions or anything like that. There's still value in predicting what comes next, after those 2 down days.  If you recall when we were booming past 15K, I said "This is a bubble, it's dangerous to assume it'll go up forever". I definitely did not wait for confirmation there! But I did get spammed and trolled and yelled at, so I simply stopped.
As for well-reasoned arguments, I see your point there and will consider it when making future calls. Although helping the community isn't my first priority - I don't want people to lose their money, but I've realized that I can't convince anyone to chance their positions just by posting here.

I'm not a BTC investor but I get the impression that it's not a bear market. I mean, from the POV of most people Bitcoin just goes up. It's a bull market all the way to lofty valuations and widespread adoption.  Anything along the way is a blip, or noise, or FUD.  
And I don't blame em. I'd be the same if I came here, bought BTC, and saw it only go up.  But now, it's shifting to something different - denial.  You're 20% in the red, what's easier to believe - that this is just like any other minor dip, or that you make a bad investment decision?

Dow down 2.5%. Bitcoin down 55%.  You may be right soon but not yet.  Your own predictions aren't proof that your predictions are right. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:07:54
This is a really big investing mistake man.  Just extrapolating from past prices to predict the future prices.  It happens during buying frenzies like this but it always stops and reverses eventually.

Nice job, I've been looking forward to seeing this!

For a good reason, it's following it perfectly so far. If it continues, the next step is bloodbath. It'll fall so hard and fast that people won't be able to get out of the way.

Anger + Denial leads people to some strange conclusions.

Lightning is freakin awesome. But it won't do much to the price since most of the money flowing into Bitcoin came from people wanting to make money.  Now they are leaving for reasons that have very little to do with the technology.  They just aren't making money anymore, so they sell.
The tech will be great for Bitcoin in the long run, but you're fooling yourselves if you think that your coworker that bought at 15K and sold at 10K is going to buy back in because transactions are now lightning fast - when she's only ever made 2 transactions and didn't plan to make any more.
On another note, great sketch! Did you do this?

Dido, you know that female voice in Eminem's 'Stan'?  He sampled one of her songs for it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:09:15
Oh yeah, definitely true.  But on average, the book is thinner now than it was then. Also there are buyers and sellers that don't use limit orders so they never show in the book.

Big money/smart money is out. It's all retail trading back and forth at this point.

It's just the way it is with anything this volatile. The feeling happens with penny stocks too.  You will almost assuredly get over the feeling in time, as long as you don't have more invested than you can stand to lose.  But say if you put your entire savings in it? You'll be checking 24/7 for a very long time. Sounds like you're already improving past that though, so I like your chances.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:37:20
Yes, nothing is guaranteed.  Something unexpected could happen and throw conventional knowledge out the window.  I wouldn't be inclined to rest on that belief however.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:04:30
I am fairly confident calling it a crash.  Hell, if the flash crash in 2010 (10% drop) got the label, 60% surely gets it as well.

Hi, resident FUDder and Bear here. Also doomsayer. Or what have you. 
So, if we turn down again and get through 8000 then it's going to nosedive very hard.  Maybe I know what I'm talking about or maybe I don't. Maybe I just want you to sell so I can get cheap coins.  Maybe I'm just salty that I didn't buy Bitcoin and missed out on the gains. Who knows!  
Edit: So last night I was watching GDAX. 4500-high wall, gone in an hour or even a bit less.  During that time I just watched the orders go by. Red. All red. Ever see several minutes go by at a time with literally 0 people clicking "Buy" on GDAX, while thousands of Sells go by?  This is a different market now.

Remember when the nasdaq dipped in 2000?

This theory is 100% wishful thinking.

If real, sell now and take your loss. There's the potential for much deeper losses.  On the bright side, there will be less money for your wife to take after the divorce! &lt;/s&gt;

At some point today or tomorrow, there's going to be a ferocious bounce of several hundred dollars all in 1 blink.  Not that it'll help anyone trade it, but gaps like this are pretty rare so it's a curiosity of nothing else.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:30:23
I don't agree. "Responsible" is too strong a term. But anything that a person reads can have an impact.  I see how you'd take this as arrogance but it's not my intent.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:04:42
Great point. Bubbles aren't the end - recovery is always possible. But it does tend to take longer than most people think, with lots of false bottoms along the way. It's hard to trade and impossible to predict details.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:26:39
That's a short squeeze, when people that shorted the asset or futures and all got trapped and had to buy to cover all at once.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:05:05
As you get deeper into the red, it's becoming more and more amusing to watch your reactions.  No troll, and I normally don't like to call people out... but it's so damned easy to push your buttons!

7540 right? What is the timeframe for it to get there?
I am still interested, yes.

He's in so much denial, it's amusing yet very sad.

It's done it twice before, this shouldn't come as a surprise!
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:36:02
This works for now - if you buy and sell at a loss, you can claim that loss on a 1099 come tax time. With stocks you can't do that if you sold within 90 days of buying - it's called a "wash sale" and the rule exists to prevent people from selling during crashes and immediately buying back in.
Watch closely to see if this loophole changes, because I expect it to do so soon.

This is one of the problems with fiat that has yet to be solved. And many would argue that it can't be solved - with fiat issued by a central bank, inflation will always exist. The central bank should act to control it, but they need to juggle it alongside many other factors. And they can't always get it right.  Lately many would say (myself included) that they are dropping the ball. 
It's like that meme with the guys carrying too many limes.  They cannot do everything required of them at the same time without destabilizing some aspects of the economy.  But it's not a "total scam" as you claim.  
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:57:43
This is a bit premature to call, but your observations are keen. I've seen this before, but not in Bitcoin. Very eery. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:15:09
Actually, most probably don't. It's projection, like how an immature democrat or republican from Reddit's "safe space" subs will start accusing the other side of all the of stuff that they themselves so.  If you make yourself believe that everything else is a bubble it's easier to laugh off the idea that Bitcoin might be.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:37:46
I think you're on to something. It's pretty clear that people piggybacked off bitcoin to create pump and dumps in altcoins, but I'd never considered how it was happening. If you're right then what we have is the same value being used to support the price of an asset being counted many more times than it should. This reminds me of CDOs and MBSs which ended up being leveraged 50-100 to 1 as a result. When the underlying asset finally went down, the entire house of cards crashed.
This could also have the effect of making altcoins trade in tandem with BTC. And... lately they have. Man.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:40:30
Bitcoin doesn't really plateau - it overshoots to the upside, crashes, overshoots to the downside, booms, and repeats.  "When to get off the train?" is an age-old question that trips up almost everyone.  Most people sell too soon or too late - but when the high is a single moment in time, it's hard to get off right there.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:07:31
Just wait even if you want to do that. Last time, Bitcoin lead the way, and after it went parabolic that's when the pumps and dumps in alts started. If you get into alts now, you're risking picking the wrong one(s).  And remember of course that alts are for making a quick buck, nothing more.

So without using numbers, I first bought $X BTC. Then a day later, $X more.  Then it was $3X a week afterward. Today it was $5X.  
Is this a common pattern here? I've never been this bullish before, so it's new to me. A few more times and I'll be all-in, which my brain tells me not to do.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:00:43
8000 this time is like 2000 was last time. We had just doubled, but the frenzy hadn't kicked in yet.  For Vegeta this time, it'll be a very chill party compared to the raucous celebration in 2017.

I know, I've probably given that advice hundreds of times here in the last few years! It's tougher when you've got gains though, as I'm seeing.  But yes, I'm going to use common sense and take your (and my) advice.
