I have held ETFs with both Fidelity and Vanguard, and for regular investing I go without a doubt go for Vanguard based on fee structure, transparency about motives, and the overall impression that they do things based on the best interest for their investors, albeit in with a conservative no frills approach. As of this year I closed all Fidelity accounts and moved everything to Vanguard. 
In terms of Vanguard and crypto, they are wonderfully neutral on the matter. It is not their cup of tea, but they don't hinder their users who have interest in it. I have been able to purchase GBTC without issue as well as transfer funds to other financial custodians for the purchase of crypto. 
Roughly about six months ago I went through the process of finding a suitable financial advisor based on my investing style and specifically said that I wanted someone familiar with cryptocurrency so that they could better advise a well rounded portfolio given the level of risk I had already assumed. The financial advisor who I was paired with at Vanguard was familiar with BTC and ETH, and confided that he also owned GBTC. He was clear that his fiduciary duty was to give the best advice possible on my behalf, and was very upfront in they ways in which the depth of knowledge on the subject of crypto was limited (relative to my background). He was honest also about how his advice was most suitable for Vanguard based ETFs, but had no issue running computational models for possible portfolio scenarios with a high proportion of information tech and small cap companies (high volatility) paired with non-vanguard gold etfs (different trends than the stock market). In the end I opted not to go with a Vanguard financial advisor, but that is simply because of my own interest in directly managing my own investments, rather than any issues with having cryptocurrency as a part of my long term portfolio.

I think I am nervous about long-term storage part of bitcoin. I worry about technology changing (will my computer have a USB drive a decade from now?), combined with my level of klutziness (spilled coffee, chaos of moving often). The use of GBTC/COIN would be more for IRA investing longterm. Ideally I would also like the equivalent of a savings account with just Bitcoin/Etherum, but I am uncertain about durability/not loosing a Trevor or Ledger over a decade. From what I have seen cryptosteel is more the design style I would feel most comfortable with (keep it simple, indestructible) but I am a bit confused as to how to move funds onto/off of a device like this. Are there any tutorials/suggestions on this?

The image is misleading because there are replicated nodes (for instance BitcoinMarkets in purple is linked to Bitcoin twice). The relationships should be remapped, with one node per site, line width as the strength of the relationship (or parallel lines if you want to show directionality of user traffic). Node size could represent a couple of things, but as a metric of site activity would be nice (number of posts per subscriber). As a side note, where is the bitcoin beginners node?

So I just decided to go GBTC for regular investing in the shorter term, but with the intent to shift funds to an IRA after March 11th (either sticking w/ GBTC or going with the new ETF if it happens). From what I could gather, now is a better time to buy GBTC because the premium is lower than previously, pretty much over speculation over ETF (a better option due to lower fees + higher trade volume, but is still unknown if it will happen). Waiting is an option, as is just buying regular BTC now, but I figured it would be a worthwhile experiment. Overall from what I gather GBTC really only makes sense if you want to invest in bitcoins for the very long term, and you don't quite trust yourself to a wallet safe for &gt;decade. IMO, the main fault of GBTC is the 2% annual fee which makes it similar to an actively managed mutual fund.

I just started with Bitcoin and called my bank (Whatcom Educational Credit Union in Washington State, USA) prior to setting up the bank transfer details. They were very nice about things and pretty much said I can do what I like with my money, and that I didn't need to notify them. Initially I was worried that I would have my account frozen for it simply being BTC related, and I wondered if I had to tell my bank of plans in advance similar to when traveling internationally and dealing with unusual currency exchanges. They gave me the impression that using a credit card might be more problematic (they have their own rules). Pretty much I was reminded of why local credit unions are way better than larger corporate banks. 
On a semi-related note, Vanguard was also nice about purchasing GBTC for an IRA contribution. They blocked the trade initially (standard procedure for OTC stock) until I called them and said, yes I know that this is not a regular Nasdaq trade or ETF. After that I was able to adjust my limit orders and trade online as usual.

Pretty much if you are single, you need to make less than $37950 in taxable income to have a tax rate of 0% on long term capital gains and dividends. If you are couple the number is less than $75900. **EDIT so the big unknown in this however is whether BTC exchange will count towards capital gains, or if this will change in the future to be some other tax or income category.
The other perfectly legal tax avoidance option is to contribute to a Roth IRA now (and pay regular taxes now), and then cash out and not have to pay taxes on any profit far in the future when you retire (or qualify for special exclusions). You can't do this directly w/ BTC, but you can buy stock in a fund that reflects that market (like GBTC or possibly COIN in the future). On a semi-related side note, if you get into the land of super low income, or just the wrong kind of income (aka money from things like fellowships, inheritance, or capital gains related) there are limits on how much you can contribute to a Roth IRA in a given year.

I will try to keep that in mind. I put all my coins in coldstorage, and will hide it for a while if needed to avoid temptation to sell all. I am going to stick to my plan of investing small amounts weekly and just hope it all averages out for the best.

Bitcoin noob here, but would something like 1 BTC online (e.g. coinbase wallet) for general purchases, a large chunk hot on computer wallet w backup (e.g. Exodus), another chunk for multi-decade storage in stock portfolio/IRA via GBTC (maybe COIN in the future) be good enough? 
Would the next security step be to print 2-3 copies of notes and put them in different locations (1 copy on-site, 1 copy in safe deposit box, 1 copy with trusted financial partner)?At what point ( ?) would it be good to invest in some sort of external device to store info?

Wow, cool that works. This is the second paper wallet I have ever made. (The first one has 0.001 BTC and gave it to my friend who introduced me to bitcoin, he just moved to Malaysia so I haven't found out yet if it worked). Most of my hodlings are on a Keepkey, will slowly transfer to paper once I research ink types a bit more :).

I have a tax question about using exchanges. I am going to simplify the numbers here. Let's say I get some ETH for $5, it goes up with time and is now worth $7.50. I then go to an exchange and swap it for BTC of equal value which then goes up to $8.50 in value and at that point I swap it for USD. 
Would the tax be on the price difference at two points in time, being ETH from purchase to BTC conversion (7.50-5 = 2.50) plus BTC to USD conversion ($8.50-7.50 =1), or would it be straight ETH to final end of USD ($8.50-$5=3.5)? 
Second, would there be taxes if I just converted ETH to BTC, and then hodled (meaning $5 from USD to cryptocurrency, swapping currencies and using them, but never converting back to USD?)
Thank you for any feedback on this, I am rather new to BTC and the tax part of it is the most confusing thing I have encountered.

@_date: 2017-03-08 04:46:19
Assuming the debt is a low percent interest (like student loans rather than credit cards), sell all your mutual funds and move 90% of that money into ETFs which offer the high diversity but with lower fees (I would recommend something like Vanguard's S&amp;P 500, some bond ETFs, and maybe some other things to match your age/risk level). Use the remaining 10% towards a BTC, or the COIN ETF if it is approved.

Ah thank you, that makes more sense now

I am new to the world of cryptocurrency and opting to go 50%-50% BTC and GBTC in the near future. The GBTC is what was easiest to purchase first, took very little time to acquire once I decided to go with it (it works via only limit order, so roughly 24 hours wait at most), and had the bonus of that I could put it in a Roth IRA. I think of it as sort of a place hodler for an ETF in the future, either via COIN or conversion of GBTC to an ETF. Even if COIN is rejected, a bitcoin ETF will happen at some point in time. I figure that a large chunk of the new wallstreet interest in bitcoin will stop w/ easy to trade options and held in a way that is easy to compare to other items in an investment portfolio. Recently the premium was at an all time low close to 2%, so in the grand scheme of things I think now is a good time to get GBTC but with the view that the scenario might be quickly change in the near future. Today for instance the price went up 7.75% = $10 a share (roughly equal to $93 dollar jump per bitcoin it represents, even though bitcoin itself is almost identical in price to 24 hours ago). 
The BTC is more for my personal use + long term savings + trying to support what I think is an awesome technology platform for the future. There was certainly a bit of delay getting this in motion (learning curve, time to set up account, transfer, yada yada) but now I am trying to do average purchases over time and explore different options for exchanges, wallets, fees, and everything else. The level of volatility is a bit much to get used to, but I do think in the grand scheme of things I want to have a portion of my savings in something other than USD due to concerns over inflation combined with level of national debt. 
Anyhow, thus far no regrets with going for a bit of GBTC for the short term (and bit for very long term).

The ink part of it scares me, I worry about it fading or getting water on it. Cryptosteel is really nice, that is certainly on my wishlish (they are on back order at the moment). I have also been thinking about dusting off my old jewelry/metal tools to a seed key (moon base) out of hammered copper. I haven't done acid etching before, but that could look really good.

If your coins are in Coinbase, and you want to sell them now for USD, then your best bet for the lowest fees would be to open up GDAX (it is an exchange website that is linked to Coinbase, identical login) and deposit your coins there. Then, sell them on the GDAX market, and transfer the money back to your bank account. If you want to keep the bitcoins long term, then move it onto a wallet that is not within Coinbase (that way you own the coins). I like Exodus (a wallet on your computer w/ a nice interface) or Keepkey (a cold wallet that plugs into your computer, by far the safest option). Hope this helps!
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:17:34

On a semi-related noted I am balancing my GBTC risk by also investing in Vanguard Corporate Long Term Bond ETF + REIT ETF, two things that are trading lower now (opposite wall street trends), are relatively stable, and have good dividends ~4%. They will probably go down again in the future w/ Federal Reserve changes to interest rates, but I would rather go with that than anything related to stocks which are trading at an all time high. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:32:56
I like the Keepkey interface (passcode used every time, confirmation of address with every transaction) and a larger size that is easier for me to keep track of. With USB thumbdrives, I worry that I will forget what it is for, loose it, or do something klutzy with it. My other cold wallet is a vintage cigarette case that holds smaller paper bills.

Last I checked the premium was even lower (it is almost one percent!) so I bought more. Right now roughly my half of my Roth IRA contribution this year is GBTC and I will do the other half mid March (either with COIN or GBTC).
