I had 100 at $3, sold at $10 for some weed and acid on silk road.  Can't say I'm depressed about it all though, life happens and I made my choices. I just wish I could go back to that old wallet.  I know I never sent it all for the order, so I probably have 1-2 btc in change just sitting there; not to mention the change the feds grabbed from silkroad and alphabay. Prolly another whole btc.

To be honest, I've made over 200% profit in about a week holding some ripple. So that's not really much.

Pretty much this.  The bubble will pop, but not 6 months after shit's just getting interesting.  Banks are just looking at thing now; there is still serious money to flow in before it all begins to reverse.  Look at any good bubble and it takes years before it comes crashing down.

I happened to be awake late at night when bch peaked for a few hours before crashing down, I managed the sweetest .50 exchange from bch to btc.  Never thought I'd see that.

No shit. It's why I only spent $400. I don't need someone from the internet telling me that. All anyone really know about the movement of crypto is buy low sell high anyway, and with the price ever rising there's not much reason to ever really sell. I had as good of a chance as anyone here, and it why I had turned 400 bucks into nearly a third a Bitcoin.

I see 9500 on cryptowatch.  Bought at 9100. feels good to grab that post-pre-10k-9k bitcoin

well bitcoin cash went from 600 to 2500 so thats over 400%, do a little trading after/in between and you could easily squeeze out some more.  I spent all weekend moving coins from coins to coins.  I regret missing that small bump in Dash though.

baby its a straight line up, buy when you can, sell a little when you need a vacation from the stress, then buy more when you get home.

This was my weekend.  Starting to flood into my week.  pls send help.  making 10 bucks a day isn't enough to feed my family.

As long as money flows into bitcoin it will expand.  Doesn't need to bubble because people don't want to panic sell, they want to ride it up.  Some will, but hodl tight, it's a straight line up to 100k now.

Oh I lost a lot thanks to Krakens shit. It was so hard to make and cancel.orders you pretty much had to guess what was going on. 
I only have a few hundred in, but I could have been at .27btc, but instead I'm at .13 thanks to missed opportunities and laggy transactions. I mean its better than the .04 I had last Wednesday, but still. I couldve had a thousand more dollars if kraken had their shit together.

Mfw 100 btc is gone after 200 bucks.

Rip 200 btc for 2oz of South African bush weed for edibles. So long ago. So many regrets.

I remember when I had 200 and it hit 5 bucks and I cashed out on SR for a thousand dollars worth of different things. 5x your investment seemed like a good place to cash out at the time.
