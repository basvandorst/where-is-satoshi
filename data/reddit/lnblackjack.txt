Are you planning to have the backup of the seed backup at a different place? If not and you just want an extra wallet for privacy/theft you could also create extra wallets from the same ledger and seed. 
It’s based on your current seed + a passphrase. In ledger you can than link it to a second pincode or have it ‘temporary’ in memory each time. 
This way if the ledger gets stolen they will probably not find your second account (unless they try and crack that passphrase)

Only need like a few minutes to write it with pen and paper.

If you need to do more testing, you could use an existing lightning app for these kind of tests. Eg on our site you can freely deposit and withdraw with lightning. Or take your chances with the deposit ;)
Many other Lapps will let you choose an amount for the invoice as well. Just my 2 sats.

Don’t try this at home

It just gets exponentially harder with each extra character. Everything above 12 or so can be considered quite safe unless of course you use words or sentences instead of random characters.

If you concat 3 very common words it would be possible to find, but longer random phrases are very hard. Don’t use sentences from songs or other existing phrases though. 
There are a lot of words, that’s why there are *much* more combinations of 3 words than 3 letters. 
I just found this site which will probably be very helpful In explaining further.

If that’s about the length of the actual password there is no way to brute force it. What’s your loss?

I don’t think they support lightning, right?

Covfefe. Mark my words.

Its a replace by fee outbound transaction. If it’s not confirmed yet you could create a new transaction with a high fee to overrule this one.

Great news! We've implemented this better provably fair method by generating the serverseed before the clientseed. The logging and code should be more clear now, and we also set up a full explaining page on the technique: [

It appeared to be an easy fix with a css property. If you want to try again you might need to hit refresh. Let me know if there is any other issues with FF.
@_date: 2019-05-01 19:03:50
Thanks! We'll look into the compatibility. Also your point on the 21 seems fair, we'll add it to our enhancement list.
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:06:00
That's fully correct. As we want to prove after every hand how the deck looked like, we can not reuse the deck. It ensures the player the game is fair.

Hi something went wrong with the ln payment, the amount is reinstated in your account. Let me know if it works now. also  definitely let us know your remark on the provably fair part, here or in private as you want!
@_date: 2019-05-01 19:19:47
I'm sorry you do not like a betting platform. Yes withdrawing issues exist, this is lightning which is still experimental. There can be issues with channels, routing problems etc..
One of the goals of this website is exactly this: exposing the existing issues so we can all together build to make lightning ready for widespread adoption!
Also, if the payment fails, a few minutes later the amount should be back in the account so you try again, possibly with a better funded channel etc..

You are indeed right, and I like your way of thinking. Reading this, I think indeed the key point is that the server should expose its hash before the client sends his seed. As from there there are many options, but yours looks pretty neat. 
For practical reasons I would replace the keyboard mashing with the random generator that is used now in the browser :), there is no way for the server to guess this.
 We'll analyse this further, but this input is very useful and I'll likely implement this soon. Thanks!
