noone called the internet a fad

No, that is like saying because people no longer get their wages in rum (see rum rebellion in Australia) money cant work.better money takes over from inefficient money. Alts are crypto. Bitcoin is obsolete

crypto is high risk with potential high reward. Stocks are lower risk with lower but moredependable reward. Don't risk most of your money.

I keep my backup seed phrase at the bank. Every other method of storage is either as risky, or so complicated I am likely to forget how to recover it in ten years ifI need to

Seriously, everyone thought the internet was great in the 90s. Maybe three people in the world thought it was a fad. It's not the same at all.

A diversfied and hedged etf is designed fr a global recession

Bitcoin is not safe at all. it is a lottery ticket. I am not sure that buying one BTC is a good idea, but I am so confident in a diversified ETF that I will be borrowing money against my house to invest (tax advantages also in Australia). Bitcoin is a moon shot that could pay off or explode. 
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:23:03
Diversified ETF will get you there safer
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:02:59
Let me approach this from a different direction. Bitcoin has been treated with suspicion because people see it not as a new form of technology but as a get rich quick scheme - a ponzi or investment bubble. Whereas the internet was just something new they didn't understand. If we can get people to see Bitcoin as a new technology that can bring people benefits or transform the world like the internet then it will succeed.
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:28:09
What are you talking about? No one thought it was a fad. Just because people couldn't forsee the coming 20 years of change doesn't mean they thought it was nothing
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:26:58
Bitcoin is fucking rubbish, it is the Atari of crypto next to the PS4 coins of today. But why the fuck would ask a bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2019-07-25 04:56:13
I have one BTC, but the amount is meaningless. What you need to do is ensure that only 10% of yournet worth is in crypto and put the rest in diversified Vanguard ETFs or property. Crypto is high risk, high reward so you want the bulk of your money earning less risk 7% compounding (which will still make you wealthy)
@_date: 2019-08-28 09:10:58
So judge doesnt believe there are any bitcoin? So 50% of nothing ..,
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:07:03
yes they are, yes it can

VET is basically Ethereum designed for business and has lots of features that make it easy to use, like being able to chose which party has to pay the fee. Walmart and half the big 4 accounting firms use it.

I was one of those 16m. Didn't have any money at the time to invest sadly.
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:01:24
You're a fucking idiot. Stocks are a much better investment. Yes i have money in btc but it could all go to zero

KYC exchanges with fiat are safer and more regulated.

stocks have 20 times as much historical record as btc

Koolaid is possibly the safest asset to hold right now, with the greatest potential upside.

Don't invest in me fo sure

bitcoin is fucking useless as a currency.

What technology? shit is ten years old and barely works.

So you are fine with waiting 30 mins in 7/11 for three confirmations to buy a carton of milk? Doesn't work.

Stock to flow is dumb because it doesn't take into account demand. There might only be 3 pictures of john candy naked but if no one wants to buy them then scarcity is irrelevant.

Btc doesn't work for payments. Do some basic research.

I haven't actually seen any of these in Melbourne. Maybe it's a queensland thing

Feel free to make an argument that contradicts mine.

Look into compounding interest with stock market ETFs. you can make a fucking fortune if you start in your 20s. Lot less risky too.
@_date: 2019-09-22 05:40:52
Bitcoin is inversely correlated with stock market of late
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:18:14
Hard to say where the top of the market should be. But with negative interest rates here, I'd say they can keep going further because people will no longer be inclined to keep money in banks or bonds.  
Also, if you are investing over the long term, then unless you get caught in a 1920s style crash, your portfoilo will soon recover and keep increasing
