Don't let your money be fiat!

You sure took this obvious joke seriously.

What do you mean *outside* the US? There is no *outside* the US... There's US and Not-Yet-US.

Oh ok, so if say I do a "request payment" for BTC 0.01, the address can be reused and for different BTC values? (I understand why it messes with your privacy)

Cool thanks :)

Awesome thanks a lot

What if the Skype-Box can be connected to things that aren't a regular computer though? What if it can be connected to a fridge, which would then call my favorite grocery store automatically when it detects inventory is getting low via Skype, and the operator would be able to look at my fridge's content while on the call via a webcam embedded in the door?
I believe this is what the 21 inc device is trying to do. It's trying to be an integral part of the iot.

I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say. Are you suggesting that the exploit wasn't actually stolen by the NSA? These exploits where leaked last month...

I will take your free money faster.

Why should I? Is it my fault they lost all their money?
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:27:21


Why does that make you skeptical? I don't like using overused adages but there's nothing that fits better here: There's always a first time.

Honest questions: Why is qBittorrent better, and what does it have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:40:17
Well, you can dislike bitcoin without disliking half naked women on cam... so there's your answer.

I like how they put Ulbricht in there like he got arrested because he was using Bitcoin and not because he'd (allegedly?) built the biggest online drug market the world's seen to date.
Otherwise, pretty cool interview.

This. You should have the right to do what you want, including losing all your money.

As a European I'm not entirely sure what this means.
@_date: 2015-10-22 09:53:37
Excellent thanks.

It won't wipe them out no. You can set it up to dual boot.
I have Ubuntu on one partition for 90% of my PC use. Then I have Windows for when I want to play some shit.
