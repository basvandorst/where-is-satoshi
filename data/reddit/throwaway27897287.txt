Maybe I should take your advice and not believe what you say.


The moment we have been patiently waiting for is finally here! From now on, all Fidor UK customers have their individual account numbers.

Ahh... yet more more political drama.
I can just imagine this type of article being shared in except it would read more like:
"Why Donal Trump's Presidency should be correctly classified as an 'attempted robbery' of the USA"

Over the next few weeks, I see a steady and slow decline in bitcoin price. Testing $1100 by end of Friday...$1050 by Saturday...$1000 on Sunday.... See you later Bitcoin, you acting kinda weird lately. Go to the bathroom and have a good look in the mirror and pull yourself together. I'm going out for the night with my new friend Ether. She has lots of exciting things to offer. Give us a call when you are ready to start acting normal again.

Fidor seem like a stupid bank. I dont actually see what value they are offering to the public. I heard that customers were not assigned their own individual bank account number until very recently. What bank doesnt give a customer a unique number?? It's also not possible to receive SEPA or international payments?! Neither is it possible to send a BACS payment to the account. They only thing they got going for them, is the cheap £2.50 SEPA fee to send money, and the apparent reputation they are 'bitcoin friendly' - although something tells me this policy will change soon enough.

Block chain technology is resistant to attacks...but humans...they are fallible.

Bitcoin is running out of time. People reconsidering their position and researching altcoins are not being weak; they are being sensible and logical. 
Bitcoin has until the end of 2017 to make more of an impact before it's too late. There are certain groups of people who don't like Bitcoin. To them, cryptocurrency is a threat, and they will spend a lot of money and effort to deny Bitcoin reaching mass adoption. In my opinion they will succeed. 
This multi-year squabble of yours... some people whisper, is a result of deliberate engineering by some groups of people. After all, if the elections of the USA can be influenced or swayed, then I suspect infiltrating the Bitcoin community is a piece of cake in comparison.
FAKE NEWS!!!!
IM NOT A HODLER, YOU'RE THE HODLER!
BITCOIN IS VERY HUGELY DYING!

6 figures is in the hundred of thousands range, and not what I consider a life-changing amount of money. Many people retire with 6 figures.
