Are you saying that credit shouldn't be available to get a starter home for a young couple, or to start a new business, or to simply pay for food till the next paycheck?
Because the alternative is concentration of wealth among a few, as young people graduating college won't have access to any money to buy a home, car, start a business, anything. They'll have to rent everything for decades, further enriching the older wealthier class.
Credit and access to future payments is important, and Bitcoin doesn't seem to have that built in the system.

Yes, but no one will want to sign a contract to future pay 100 Bitcoin when we don't really know the strength (good or bad) of that in several years. Without some govt authority making sure we are at a set target inflation (1-2%), there really isn't a way to have a good future payments contract.
Everyone remembers the example of the guy who bought a pizza with bitcoins that are now worth thousands. No one wants to be that guy.

But that removes consumer protection also then? What if after paying my bitcoins I realize whatever product I got doesn't work.
We will need a central Bitcoin escrow place then, which will have to do the same functionality as a clearing house/bank, to put in those protections

I thought they had transitioned, why are we showing their old faces. It's disrespectful.

That third party will effectively be a bank, providing credit/debit/atm cards of bitcoins.
And at that point, bitcoins will be same as current cash, losing their anonymity and no longer decentralized, going through 2-3 major bitcard providers like Visa and MasterCard.

But we are discussing about consumer protections/charge backs and how they will work with bitcoin. The problem here isn't that the govt holds large cash reserves or is printing it. The problem here is that in a decentralized system the little guy loses protections.
No matter how you slice it, if the desire is to offer consumer protections from big business, there will need to be some centralized system backed by legal govt enforcement. And at that point, bitcoin stops being useful.
Of course, the alternative is that everything is an uber-like rating based economy, but that again once they become too big come under the local laws as they are with these apps. So we are back to the point where any bitcoin related transactions are under govt control because we need consumer protections backed by our local laws.
