Don't go getting a Raspberry Pi to use as a media centre. Complete waste of money, if that's your intended use. 
They're fantastic things to play around with, and great to have around for small one-off server tasks- but a media centre? The thing's just too limited. XBMC *runs*, but it's by no means a pleasant experience.

And they still suck.

Curious- my OpenELEC install's a bit of a mess. It's certainly whole worlds more usable than RaspBMC, but it still has enormous trouble dealing with my setup. 
I'm storing about 400GB of videos on a NAS, and I've set XBMC up to build its library from them directly over SMB. None of them are particularly high resolution files- I have the same issues streaming a 480p DivX file and streaming a 1080p MP4/MKV. Streaming over a network makes the Pi absolutely choke- operations take several seconds to register after command input, menu operation is generally quite sluggish, and, most damningly, playback itself's flawed. Even after boosting HDMI signal strength, output still flickers distractingly every couple of seconds. Beyond that? After about twenty minutes of playback, the entire system hard-locks and has to be rebooted. 
It's just not worth fussing with, when the final cost of a Raspberry Pi media centre, once a powered hub, input device and Wi-Fi dongle's costs have been factored in, comes to about that of something like a Roku. 
The Pi's a great little device- but using it as a media centre's not really the best thing to put it to work as.

Done. It still fails hard for no explicable reason after a couple of minutes whilst playing from a network share. 
And this is after endless diving into configuration files and overclocking. 
It's only barely usable, with its weak hardware.
