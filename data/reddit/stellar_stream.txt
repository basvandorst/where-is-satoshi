I'm thinking one and or both of these is true: 1) drug money laundering or 2) going thru a divorce

My partner was skeptical at first but now he is on board and asks how my investment is doing.  He also gave me some fiat for Christmas which he said was for more Bitcoin!  
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:24:55
That's no consolation at all to me that is on blockchain.   Ever heard of cold storage?  You should have that stored in the refrigerator. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:02:15
You'd owe taxes ON the $1000, not taxes of $1000.

You want to talk energy consumption and point the finger at bitcoin?  Do some research on the HUGE amount of energy usage by Facebook, Google, Microsoft and any of the other "cloud" storage facilities.  These cloud facilities are huge buildings containing thousands of servers running 24/7/365 consuming not only the energy to run the servers but also the air conditioning units to keep them cool.  But yeah, blame bitcoin if it makes you feel better.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:43:24
I'm sorry for the loss of your brother.  If its any consolation you could find a tidy sum.  Good luck.  Seriously.

Retired.  Now get back to work!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:45:09
Op is right.  Just hold what you have and buy more if it dips to an acceptable level for you.  I'm hoping for 9k then I'm buying.

They're status page says the system will be down for maintenance until 3pm eastern.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:35:50
So true!  Avoid them like the plague.

Congratulations and welcome to the club!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:36:54
Wow who does this?  You are given the specifics of the transfer before confirming.  Either this is more btrash FUD or someone isn’t paying attention to what they are doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:06:02
Has happened to me twice. Eventually CB wii cancel the order.

2pm eastern and we are cooking with fire on GDAX now
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:34:57
True!  I have never had a problem with their app. Coinbase?  Yes.  But not the app. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:50
Right after I get finished with my cigarette.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:58:06
I have that same ticker app.  My usage prolly will be close to yours.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:01:17
Hey dickwad, I can do basic math and my question wasn't about math, it was about a basis for profit.  Apparently, you don't know the answer either so STFU!

Sounds like he had a mouthful of marbles.  �� 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:36:16
No sweat, buddy.  I logged in to buy some at the recent dip and saw they were down for maintenance.  You probably heard me curse from where you are.  :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:30:36
Yup, just did!  
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:24:33

Do we know which subreddit this was posted?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:31:54
But isn’t that illegal also??  And I get that would be difficult to prove. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:06
Its fucking cray cray!!  I'm lovin every minute!
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:50:18


Hell, lemme think...I want to say it took 4 to 5 weeks.  CB will send you an email informing you the transaction was cancelled.


Yes, If the value of Bitcoin is more than your original transaction when you buy again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:49
I see the same thing as the OP.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:37:13
“you read news articles similar to FOX”. 
LOL. Perfect

I completely agree.


Yes, stability would greatly increase public acceptance.

Bought at $9070 and then the price shot back up.  I got lucky.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:23:49
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:28:51
Oh great!  111 million new subscribers all making a post asking if the value of Bitcoin is going to go up or down in the next month.

@_date: 2017-11-10 09:35:41
Welcome to the club.  Lots of information here:
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:25:37
$100-$11=$89  that's how much USD you will get.  Now, in btc, 89 divided by 10,000 = .0089, so just under 1% of a coin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:20:26
Found this.  Hope it helps.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:44:14

@_date: 2017-11-13 16:42:33
Done!  Thanks for your advice.  Only took two hours to get 8 confirmations with the first confirmation taking about 10 mins.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:37:03
I’m thinking YES!

Edit the bookmark to read whatever you want it to read.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:34:43
True!  That's how I started six week ago.  However, its not much more difficult to use GDAX.  
Edit: and the no fee trading on GDAX is a plus.

I have the same situation as OP, bought on Coinbase and transferred all to Electrum wallet.  But I do not understand how the second coin, whichever it is, shows up.  Will it just appear in my account on Coinbase someday??  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:59:16
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:37:58
