Lol @ failure of eth. Yeah, what a massive failure.
@_date: 2016-08-27 03:12:58
Aha it'll be years before it hits BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:29:00
It is indeed...favorite app wallet by far. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 00:15:20
What sidechains? What LN? Which layer 2 apps? Where? When?

I'm curious do Coinbase competitors pay trolls to spread false stories or are every one of these Coinbase support problems true?
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:17:58
Most people on this sub don't give it a lot of love but personally I think it's fantastic. Super easy to use and works with Eth (and soon Dash). All the code is auditable and open to see and been verified before that it doesn't store any users' keys. 
Bread wallet is the de facto Bitcoin wallet, also safe. 
Be sure not to download any fakes.

Do you really think Counterparty is the premier force in smart contracts today? a $5 million dollar market cap versus a billion dollar market cap? Seriously?
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:40:13
*Except when you accidentally create 92 billion bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:03:53
Oh, uh, yeah I totally believe centralization is necessary and beneficial *early* in development. After the product is finished, then steps should be implemented to remove the Foundation from power. And that's exactly what they plan on doing. Here are my thoughts if you're interested 
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:47:33
I dont understand the gap between a few months and a year. Does it take the miners months to adopt, or does it take wallet providers to make the change to their backend, or does it take users months to click some buttons and manually make the switch.
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:02:50
What about all the burned Bitcoin that people used to get XCP?
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:35:57


Same fucking thing with Ethereum. It's literally NO different. Vitalik telling the miners to implement the hard fork is the SAME thing as Maxwell telling the miners to implement Segwit. Stop acting like it's so goddamn different. It's disingenuous.
@_date: 2016-06-09 12:41:16
Ugh but the features/aesthetics/UI is horrible. There are virtually no customizable options. It drives me nuts.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:57:22
Code is code bro! If you don't understand the code then sucks for you. Unless, of course, it creates 92 billion bitcoin. Then just change whatever the fuck you have to change to make that little mistake disappear. Then it's totally cool.
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:08:20
And what would the community have done if the majority of miners' rejected Segwit? Either way, both communities are submitting to the whims of the miners. One day, although not this day, users of all blockchains will realize that.

Just hardforked to remove his rightfully gained property. Sounds like asset seizure and forfeiture to me.
Oh it was a bug in the protocol? Maybe all you guys should have read the protocol first and understood what the code was capable of before buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-06-08 16:27:56
Exactly. I could easily see 50k per bitcoin or higher. Simply not in today's world however. It necessarily has to be a slow change. I don't think it could go exponential when the governments decide to step in the way.

LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE
@_date: 2016-10-06 15:59:53
Stop wasting your time. They don't appreciate bold experiments in this sub
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:07:21
"bitcoin blockchain's openness and **scale** are what matters."
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:48:17
I didn't say other coins have better scale. But you cannot possibly imply that Bitcoin has scale. It doesn't.
@_date: 2016-10-06 16:07:48
There was a good reason for the premine. Check out the announcement thread on bitcointalk if you're interested.
@_date: 2016-05-22 13:52:02
Yeah exactly what I was trying to say. Can't tell if is being sarcastic or just dumb.
@_date: 2016-05-21 23:16:11
Vitalik also was the only other one with a grounded, reasonable assumption. Funny.
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:42:48
To be fair they TRIED to lead Bitcoin down a different path and were pushed out of the way by the other leaders. You can't honestly be trying to convince anyone that they didn't try. Can you?
@_date: 2016-05-24 23:47:18
And over history we've seen plenty of first movers *eventually* lose their lead. It happens all the time. Don't be so cocky.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:52:37
Edit: Youre right, nvm
Second edit: actually these guys ( say it's open source, so I'm not sure anymore.  care to answer?
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:46:18
Paul Sztorc is not very well-informed in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:09:46
If that's the case, why is Ether still going for $10-$11 bucks? Seems to me quite a few people value social consensus.
@_date: 2016-07-21 15:41:18
Just checking to see if I'm shadowbanned on this sub. Bitcoin is god.
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:54:35


@_date: 2016-07-21 14:35:30
the Bitcoin ATMs as of now are useless. If that's your argument against hard forks....
@_date: 2016-07-22 23:24:54
I've met Dave from Glidera several times. Great guy.
