Probably in doge and not btc.

I signed up in between your last promotion and this one, could I get a bonus too?

Where exactly is this ATM? I'm walking around the art district right now and I can't find it or "Satoshi Square".

For those who can't get bank accounts, there are mobile bridge services such as Eko (

if you're reading this, it would be good to address this user's issue, since it's potentially concerning to all Multibit users.

Looks cool; Butterfly Labs though.

PM'd. Thank you!

Not price-wise. But in two weeks we'll get SegWit along with immediate scaling relief and the innovation potential it unlocks!

If OP's summary excludes the New York Agreement (NYA) completely, I get the impression it's biased and has some sort of agenda.

Let's just be happy we made it through the fork relatively unified. Hurling insults rarely does any good.

You should use the Coinbase referral code.

Making it easier to buy BTC!

I got the address from the owner and sent him btc directly. Friend didn't know what Bitcoin was until today.
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:09:09
All sorted! Shout out to Hofje van Wijs Tea &amp; Coffee, their owner is amazing!

She's there. She's walking toward the Bitcoin Embassy now ( but not sure if there's anyone there at the moment.

If you click on *List of Donors* and scroll down to *Donation Summary*, you can see how much was spent on VAT and credit card fees.

Where is the original report?

There's still the uncertainty of the non-segwit block rejection and then the HF in November.

Bitcoin is also something they aren't going to be making more of.

Idea: find a local business that accepts btc (cafe, etc) and see if they would sell you some cash. They probably wouldn't be able to fill the entire $1k but you could spread it over a few businesses. I've found early adopters are generally happy to help fellow bitcoiners, especially in person.

How is Dorian doing? I hope the donations were able to alleviate some of the financial pressures he was facing.

Hi, I'm one of the makers of the site and yes it's a central wallet! Agreed that there are more appropriate places to store a large amount of bitcoins, but it's good as a hot wallet or a newbie wallet (simple UI, free and instantaneous internal transfers). Ultimately the risk/convenience balance is up to you, but for what it's worth we've published our identities on the site, and are actively using it among our own friends.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:19:25
To expand on this, transfers between the same bank are analogous to say, transfers between two accounts on Coinbase which is free and instant.
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:34:20
Yes you can!
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:21:20
I think he means guide.
You could try Bitcoins with Friends (creator here). It creates a simple wallet for you secured by your Facebook login-- not recommended for large amounts of bitcoin, but great for getting started. And we're running a promotion that will give you your first small amount of bitcoins for free on signup. Later when you learn more about bitcoins and have an opinion on how you want to store them, you're free to transfer your bitcoins anywhere.

Great work! But I wonder if this could be used for evil too, to more easily extract private keys from hacked drives.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:41:58
Could a single organization, like the government or a large corporation, topple Bitcoin with lots of money and/or computing power?

Which version of Electrum did you use for this writeup? I'm trying to set up 1.9.5 for cold storage and there's no Settings -&gt; Import/Export, only Tools &gt; Load Transaction &gt; From File.
Also, when I tried to sign a transaction using the offline wallet, I got a Python error saying "Address not found". I think it's because the online wallet is sending from a new address. The offline wallet should be able to generate the same addresses since they share the master public key, but how do I do so?

Can you elaborate on your tech stack? I've used your Clojure bitcoinj client in the past, thanks for that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:29:42
freudian slip?
@_date: 2013-07-04 21:42:32
Yes it is!
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:09:05
Thanks for giving it a try!
@_date: 2013-07-04 07:02:15
Just added the link. Thanks!

You can give them some Bitcoins through BitcoinsWithFriends.com, an easy to use Facebook-backed wallet. There's also an option to gift bitcoins in fun ways, like scratch-and-win cards.

What's the timeline for the 0.9 release?

Can you recommend some good ones?

No need to reverse-engineer it since it's open source.

I suspect litecoin miners might use their rigs to mine easier scrypt-based currencies such as dogecoin.

It is just me, or does this article read like it's been heavily SEO'd?
