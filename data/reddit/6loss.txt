1111 = F in hex. 01010101 = U in ascii. Any obvious words starting with "FU"? ;-)

Hey, thanks for posting this - only just seen it here, but nice to see word got out. I ran this just as a fun thing to do on a weekend and to see if I could get more people into Bitcoin - may or may not have worked out. I still have 0.01 left to give away.
Will post on haiku in response to below, just because I find it an intriguing thing. But if anyone's interested in non-Bitcoin haiku (and to explain why I picked haiku in the first place), I have a randomised e-book over at 
I was going to add a haiku here, but writing a "proper" one about a specific technology turns out to be pretty difficult.

Yep. There have been a few goes but gaining traction seems tricky for some reason.  Here's a look at how one of them, PikaPay, works:

That's what I love about haiku - you can't write one if you're angry...

Awesome, I remember when it was just 6 items :) I haven't been on Etsy in ages, but popped back in and great to the Bitcoin team membership has gone through the roof (compared to, y'know, "the old days ;-) :

Like any item intended to be interpreted and judged to some extent, I think it's important to discern between 'good' and 'bad' haiku. I also find it annoying to wade through 'bad' haiku which focus on syllable counts and shoehorning in seasonal words, rather than maintaining a sense of why they're writing it in the first place.
I got into haiku properly after reading some Basho and some other classics (and a book on Shinto, which is weird but kind of fun). It's depressing to see how much haiku has turned into counting syllables - this plus seasonal words are all part of the game/challenge, but very secondary to the 'point' of haiku.
I'm still working out what that 'point' is, but described it recently as 'realisation in a breath'. As such, it fits Twitter pretty well. And is also easier to write than longer forms ;-)
Like any poetry or art form, the pinnacle of haiku is to make you think/feel. If you hit that, you don't care that it's a haiku. If you miss, you end up trying to work out if it's a good or bad haiku...
