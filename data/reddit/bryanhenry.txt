Can you point me to a step by step on how to keep my own and get them out of coin base? 
I don't really understand how to do what your saying and j don't want to get caught if coin base goes down

Thanks so I guess what your saying is I would create a new wallet where only I know the passcode and transfer it all there?
How does that ensure I can always spend or have those btc? 
Is that because only I know that ... The wallet exists? But then how do I send the btc from that wallet in the case of an apocalypse :) (serious)

My father started a non-profit charity called Muskego Senior Taxi
 Which is out of Muskego, WI. They help ambulatory adults get to appointments and around the city with the support of volunteers. They are not the biggest organization but they help about 400 people a month get to dialysis, doctors appointments, and to run errands. They run off the help of volunteers and they run fundraisers with elvis impersonators to raise funds for car repairs and the one full time employee. My father has since passed but I know times are hard and I know 1 BTC would go far. If this get selected I will help them convert it and I can ask them to put a magnetic Bitcoin sign on the side of the cars "Frankly you'd be their largest donor :) "
Anyway thanks for reading, I just want to keep what my dad started going.
Merry Christmas

Whats the best resource to find out exactly how to generate a paper wallet from coins bought on coinbase? Still dont think i 100% understand the private and public key thing
Thanks in advance
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:16:39
Im sorry I dont understand this .... I own bitcoin on Coinbase... but I bought them a bunch of different times... is the private key and public key what I need to access a wallet ? or does each bit of bitcoin have a public or private key?
Sorry I know i shouldnt be involved if I dont understand it....
I eventually want to hold a little on coinbase and a little in my blockchain app but then keep the majority of whole ones save with my own private key in a couple places secured and offline

@_date: 2014-05-26 06:07:29
Thanks!!! so if someone were to hack into my account on coinbase and send them somewhere would they be gone? or do i transfer them to the wallet and store the address and key in like a safe deposit box at a bank and will forever be able to get them even if i forget m coinbase user and password?

Can someone explain to me what the Spent and unspent mean here:

Nice try this isn't 1990 when million dollar homepage worked.
Don't waste your time
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:36:10
Ummmmm it was $300 a year ago were they shutting their machines down? NO because someone will always find it worth it to mine it 
@_date: 2017-01-07 15:42:18
I did ... I'm telling you your wasting your time.
It doesn't matter it's a spin on MDH with ether... the landscape of advertising is not 1990.
It worked because people threw money at anything that was new/fresh back then that got a lot of press.
This isn't going to work 
1. nobody knows ether
2. The price hasn't done anything in a year
3. Why the f would you think someone would waste money advertising on a site you put up in 10 minutes?
Now I'm honestly intrigued... save me the bullshit about mlm and smart contracts. Tell me honestly why you think people would spend to advertise on your site?
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:43:03
Yeah i get it the reward was halved.... People will Always mine it

@_date: 2017-01-07 15:22:08
Lol you lost me when you said MLM 
Those are scams 
And again we aren't in 1990 where people are going to pay you and they get no benefit 
No one is going to visit million ether homepage and get a benefit from placing ads on it! Come on you know that deep down.
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:06:00
Is there any place that explains how to do this in easy step by step directions? I have some on Coinbase and I don't know how to secure them properly 
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:03:20
I have been trying to find how to hold coins in cold storage for over a year any ELI5 resources on how to do it?
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:53:21
Thank you very much! 
1 last question...
Say I have 2 btc on Coinbase and the allow me to get the private keys but it's not just one private key for all 2btc
Would I need to transfer them to a new wallet and get one private key that will encompass all 2btc?
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:08:42
Google it and tell me where you find an easy explanation.... Its really NOT that simple
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:13:14
Is this a stupid question? Can wallet companies go belly up like Gox and then I'm out of luck?
Im trying to put my coins in somewhere i can just store for years and then if this ever becomes main stream take my long hash code and my long phrases and send the coins to a new wallet 5-10 years down the road

Why is it rude? You must be fun to be around.
@_date: 2016-09-12 00:54:06
I don't see why it is. People make different amounts. There have been studies that show it actually helps make employees more effective. If you don't care to answer say that. But I don't believe it's rude. I'm not going to get bent out of shape because someone on reddit makes 300k. I'm sure there are people on here that make seven figures, they mostly likely worked VERY hard to get there.
@_date: 2016-09-12 00:22:59
He asked for a range of his holding to get a perspective. Not how much is in your bank account. I don't think it's rude to ask, you just need to be comfortable enough to say you'd rather not share.
