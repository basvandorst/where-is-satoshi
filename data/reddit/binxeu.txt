McAfee was responsible for the battle of Hollywood. 
After eating his own penis in a bet gone bad bitcoin finally crossed over $1million the year later, but McAfee had a taste for penis... he spent years hiding in the shadows replacing body parts with artificial improvements and eating dick. Several decades later, the transcendent minds of Seth Rogan and James Franco made a film mocking McAfees decision to stand by his bet. This maddened cyborg McAfee and powered by a diet of dicks and shit, he struck back, starting with Hollywood.

Hack works the same on toasters. Pull the lever down then Take a big paper clip and short the left grill to the right. 
The lever should pup up and deliver 2 coins at a time

It’s good to hear that there are plenty of people like yourself on the sidelines waiting to get involved. 
This makes me confident that crypto will grow to new ATHs

Could the drop on Wall Street be related to a large moving of money into crypto? And now cnbc has a vested interest to raise the profile again into another bull run
