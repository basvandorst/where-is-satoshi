Ha good idea. 
The best way I've found to promote bitcoin is, EVERY time I get to the front of the inevitable queue at some or other dinosaur institution (like a bank, cellphone company or post office) I commiserate with the poor employee about the state of their industry and retarded systems, and then mention that I just cannot wait for bitcoin to kill their industry off, and have they heard of *Bitcoin*?  Then I spend lots of time chatting to the functionary about bitcoin, their future in the industry, and where to learn more about bitcoin, while the queue gets longer and longer.......

Ah, that reminds me too - that people who bring up the point that they are talking expressly about the "dollar" valuation for bitcoin, miss the point that the valuation of bitcoin can be expressed in dollars even if there are not enough actual dollars in the world to make it real because all that is required to know that this can be real is to convert some other fiat currency into dollars in one's head and, walah! we have enough dollars :)

It think btc is like water running down a hill right now.. small myriad trickles at first, cutting wider and wider groves as time goes on and we discover the successful way to do things without the legacy State and banking systems.. 
I heard about someone buying airtime with btc in my country and transferring it to someone they know in another country who is selling airtime for fiat in their country as an informal. Which avoids the 20% fee usually charged to get money from here to there.

Bitcoin is not a business. Bitcoin is not a business. Bitcoin is not a business. 
Bitcoin is a technology. The blockchain is the working tool of that technology. bitcoin is an open source product of that technology, using the blockchain.  Have a look at ["Is the Internet a pie in the sky?"]( for a history lesson on where technologies like Bitcoin can take products. 
Technology adoption is driven by the potential and actual applications of that technology. The more complex the technology, the more complex its potential applications and hence the more complex its adoption becomes in its various applications. And, hence, the more disruptive its adoption becomes, the more antagonistic, paranoid and schizophrenic views of the technology (or usually the products being developed under that technology) become until there is general recognition that that technology and products under it are just not going to go away. And, I hear no-one saying that Bitcoin is going away. I hear no-one saying bitcoin is going away.
In short, adopting a disruptive technology like HTTP and like the Bitcoin protocols, must of necessity and intrinsically become a process of trying to discover the true path to its myriad applications in the face of stiff resistance from the systems and institutions it disrupts, amid a set of entrenched current technology that needs to be discarded, adopted or otherwise, and in the face of criticism and disbelief. 
So, what you describe happening with bitcoin cannot happen any other way at all.

At first glance this document seems to adopt a reasonable ad objective approach to bitcoin and I thought I'd reply to it here. 
But, on rereading and starting to analysing the document to formulate a reply, the more prejudicially I see it is phrased, and the more biased I see it actually is, so I'd rather trash it and wait for a less prejudiced and biased document to come out of the rederalreserve.gov.

Yes, I'm sure he's not lucky but instead extremely phenomenally and uniquely skilled. No-one can get to where he is on luck or even a large chunk of luck :) 
But, here's the question: IF the Bitcoin protocol begins to turn the world on its axis as differently as the general consensus seems to think it potentially could (as did http etc), THEN wouldn't a sign of that be people like Warren Buffet falling off the old wagon using old world models of retail, etc? 
PS: I have no beef with Buffet and not hero-knocking him because, given his track record, I assume that if the world is being turned upside down by Bitcoin that he's going to be a winner in whatever that Bitcoin world will be too. All I'm thinking is that perhaps his loss with Tesco is the bleep that spells a fundamental change. But, sigh, now I drift too far from the point that heroes are also fallible
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:11:54
And I find, that people who bring up the points you have brought up about velocity, inevitably don't take into account that over time (and may I stress "over time" so you don't answer this as if I come from the "get rich quick" on bitcoin brigade), more and more people holding bitcoin will be holding less and less fiat? And the more people hold bitcoin, the scarcer it becomes given it is limited to 21m, and the more the price will be driven up?

Taking a broad perspective, I'm not sure you are right. If one looks at Muslim dominated countries, their economies seem to me to predominantly consist of a few elite and masses of people with very little who are subject to rules and regulations which entrench that elite and which offers very little opportunity to climb the wealth ladder.
(And yes, this applies to many many non Muslim too, but that is not the topic of discussion for the mo)
Therefore, in my humble opinion, it would seem to me that no matter what kind of society, economy and political system Sharia law is intended to effect and no matter what it has resulted in in history, that the application of Sharia law can sit very prettily with and entrench an economy characterized by an extraordinarily rich elite class and masses of poor subjected to that elite. 
I doubt very much whether things that characterize bitcoin and which provide an avenue for independence from that elite (such as its pseudo-anonymity, ready-transferability,  cost-effectivity, the blockchain, sidechains, and much much more) would suit the top-down economic and other systems put in place by the power-elite.

Nope. Banks are animated by people. Likewise, fax machines are (well, maybe I should be using the word "were", but I haven't because there are still a few hanging around) animated by people. 
The operation of fax machines has been adapted and changed over the years with one model after the other. By people designing them, programming them. Etc. The operation of banks has been adapted and changed over the years too. By people. 
Right now people designing the way banks operate are scrambling - yes, SCRAMBLING - to make them as competitive with Bitcoin as they can be - but like fax machines, banks will not be replaced by, but made obsolete by, Bitcoin.

Here's how I see the Bitjell company: It's like one of those old 19th Century commercial expeditions where someone, with a dream to explore uncharted and often only guessed-at territories and rare resources, finds like-minded people with various skills that may be needed, to head off into the blue with, with the objective of finding and doing something others will pay for with their eye-teeth :)
Here, the company is a company of individuals setting out on an explore who are unable to define what they will be without going on that explore and - this it goes without saying - the uncharged territories are crypo-currencies and the extended Bitcoin protocol.

Here's a transcript of the relevant section 29:08 (sorry if I missed some um's and ah's, of which there were quite a few) 
QUESTION BY MEMBER OF AUDIENCE AT 26:00
"Hi Peter. Um, I heard you talking about Pay Pal and how you were almost hoping that it would turn into a crypto-currency, so I was wondering what you had to say about bitcoin and, and if you had created bitcoin what you might have done differently to implement it, and if you think that bitcoin does have a future in world-wide currency? "
PETER THIEL'S ANSWER
"There's sort of.. there's all these ways how... hu I'm slightly biased against bitcoin because I didn't invent it. I'd like to have.
Um. So with that, that sort of ah that, that qualifier, I think that um, you know, I think uh, there is a way in which bitcoin sort of achieved the opposite of ah, Paypal , it has actually succeeded in creating a new currency, at least on the level of speculation, I think ah the, the challenge is going to actually to get the payment system to work so its still, I think very hard to use, there there's quite some parts to the cryptographic protocols that uh, its not clear that you ever going to get it to work seamlessly or super fast or at least this I think is a core challenge that uh, that, that needs to be overcome because um, if bitcoin exists only as a currency or as a means to make verified payments for things that are very very illegal, you'll go through a lot of hoops to buy uh, you know, drugs or whatever people use it for um, that's where you're sort of set up for the government shutting it down so, so I, I would be more bullish if I saw the amount of legal payments uh, going up more, more quickly than it is, um. 
You know, the, ah I, I keep wondering whether it will just get shut down by the government at some point. You know I'm, I'm, I'm sort, I'm sort of politically abit libertarian, so I'm always a bit skeptical of the government ... I think one of the ways our government is quite dysfunctional in this country is that, uh, the fact that it has not shut bitcoin down doesn't tell you very much. 
If you had a confident government it would say, this is bad, its illegal, we're  going to stop this. Um, and, because it's so incompetent, um, you might, you might be under the view that it's perfectly fine and people will change their mind seven or eight years later. There was a company on, we encountered back in the Pay pal days called uh, e-gold which had this encrypted, gold linked anonymous certificates and we sort of made Pay pal interoperable with e-gold. It turned out it was all used for fraud, people had stolen credit cards and they used e-gold to launder their receipts into, into untraceable gold. 
Um. And so we sort of disconnected from e-gold in summer of 2000, three months after we connected. Uh, we tried to you know, the um, I, there was a press interview I gave in late '01 where I said it was a sketchy company, uh, they sued me for libel, we settled the libel lawsuit in March of 2000, you know whenever you get sued, you know you never, you never compromise, its like dealing with terrorists, you never, you never, uh, you never negotiate except in every specific instance. Um. And um, and so we, we, we settled uh, we settled the lawsuit earlier to I believe about 6 years later in O-aid, the FBI arrested all the people and they all went to jail. So, so I, I think, I still have that residual question about bitcoin whether it just gets outlawed, even although, I'm generally in favour of it. "

OK. Bitcoin has just dipped it's toe into the financial system. Even a little ripple will make its price bounce up and down. Larger waves have yet to reach its shore. These are minnow fluctuations in btc price. Something going on in one city of the world will still bounce the price around. So, wait until Bitcoin seriously starts to join the rivers of money running through London, Tokyo, New York, and heads out into the oceans before trying to identify that which is pushing the price around :)

Hmm. I wonder what the relationship is between BitX and Xoin. 
If I had to hazard a stretch of a guess, I'm wonder whether there is some backing by one of the GSM cellphones companies in South Africa (MTN, Vodacom or CellC)? I wonder because there is a strange mix of slick corporate style language on the website and some responses in other posts compared to other more "live" posts on reddit, and because Xoin's been so structured around prepaid vouchers and the expertise necessary for these clearly lie with those companies. I seem to remember that a couple days ago that SA cellphone companies' pre-paid market has slumped pretty much badly. Bitcoin is not a bad place for them to turn their attention.

The bitcoin community really needs to come up with a creative and unique solution to the problem of donating bitcoin to charitable causes. I'd donate but only if I had some way of being assured that what I put in, went to the cause, or at least very largely the cause. With the open blockchain info, and ability to add text to transaction records, it should not be so hard, should it? And if the spend was on bitcoin accepting businesses servicing the charitable need, the other side of the equation should also be fairly easy to track.

All agreed. 
But here's the thing that I sense you (and likely article author P. H. Madore) seem to be missing: 
Bitcoin is generating a separate and parallel co-existent economic system, rather than an "alternative" economic system, with its own timeline which, regardless of the state of the current entrenched economic system, has a current entry point that is pretty attractive. Waiting for the entrenched economic system to lose more wriggle room in irrational markets is a factor that should be actually neither here nor there in a decision as to whether to invest in the opportunities Bitcoin offers.

But here's the thing I suspect you are either not getting or are parking without giving it thought: It is in the nature of Bitcoin that responses to it must be WAY more than being "tech savvy" because Bitcoin is so fundamentally disruptive at every level of human economic, social, religious organisation, political and other endeavour.
Coming across ageisms such as, "older people are unable to change, not tech-savvy, getting them to understand it is like wading through mud, and they'll just drag Bitcoin down with them so cannot be part of the discussion", is to me (regardless that I'm over 60) absolutely a red flag in the Bitcoin sphere.
Statements like this indicate to me that the speaker does not really appreciate the depth and breadth of Bitcoin's ability to disrupt existing systems and so feels justified - on whatever heuristic or other grounds they can suck out their thumb to explain the moment - in limiting the conversation to those who are "tech savvy".  Or, they indicate to me that there is simply a fundamental prejudice on the part of the speaker against older people who would probably vehemently deny the prejudice by fallaciously explaining it away by saying "Oh well I was talking to a particular audience of tech savvy who happen to be younger", etc. 
To me however, and as a systems theorist, such current fault-line thinking (reflected in such things as ageist and other prejudice in the Bitcoin sphere) by tech-savvy gurus like Andreas and gurus from other fields who are sketching in real time the developing Bitcoin world and who can and do talk extensively and with great insight about the depth and breadth of Bitcoin's disruptive impact, will be to a great detriment to how pleasant that world will be for all of us. 
I'm not running the "sage wisdom of older people" argument here, by the way, but let me say this to give some insight into why I personally may have picked up on the ageism in the Bitcoin sphere: I've spent the last 9 years working on developing methodologies related to law which I've only realised in the last three years will allow me to develop a fundamental measurement of the rule of law within any definable geographical or otherwise defined territory even in a post-State world. I also realise that this personal progress has only been made possible by the 20 years of out-the-box multidisciplinary study that preceded those 9 years. And further, since I came across bitcoin about two years ago, I realise that the blockchain world fits perfectly with where I've been heading and rather than being disruptive of me, may just facilitate recognition of the work I've been doing for 30 odd years. But then alas, I find people I would otherwise admire in the Bitcoin sphere such as Andreas, closing doors in my face :(

First, appeal to greater numbers like this is a content-less and therefore a really shallow argumentative tack, and a good counter argument that makes the shallowness of it very transparent, is to bring up lemmings.
Second layer answer: Fact is, where an issue is as complicated the bitcoin phenomenon is, where none of us can easily see the mechanics of how it will and is fundamentally changing the nature of everything from finance to institutions such as the State, the majority which probably includes you and I are most often way wrong because we don't have the tools of analysis to understand what effect things like SegWit will cause, if any effect at all. OP's bald statement that it is "the ONLY real solution" is in this context absurd.

On your figures, know that $0.02 will feed one child one main meal in Zimbabwe etc, on which it could probably survive. And (as I understand it) the real $0.01 cost of a btc transaction. So that $0.03 micro-transaction should not, if Bitcoin developers had what is to me a proper vision of Bitcoin, be seen as a really small micro-transaction but a primary transaction quite capable of feeding a child to ensure it lives. 
It's a matter of proper perspective, for me: If the Bitcoin experiment can't do that, then welcome Bitcoin 2.0 and developers who really do see Bitcoin as money for the people, everywhere :)
Thanks for the conversation!
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:24:46
Bitcoin has worked without any downtime for going on a decade. It is ready. 
However, squashing what it sells - space in the block for transactions - is one sure way to make sure it becomes less and less ready to serve its market with each passing day that the market has stampeded its was. FURTHER, the fee market that has been built upon squashing blocks smaller and smaller in relation to the market demand for that product, has ensured that Bitcoin is even less ready to service its market because it now also can't even compete with its dinosaur competitors (banksters). FURTHER, delaying and delaying an increase in blocksize when the market is still stampeding your way is yet ANOTHER way to make sure that Bitcoin is not ready for market. 
So, I'd ask not whether BU protocol is ready for market, but how can you not see that Core's protocol is making really sure that Bitcoin is not ready for market?
Another thing, it seems to me that the bogeyman of "hard forks" (a concept developed by Core developers) is nothing other than the original method baked into the Bitcoin protocol by SN that is usually referred to as the Nakomoto consensus, so I see nothing wrong with what Core protocol adherents refers to as "hard forks" - they are a feature not a bug. 
So, if Bitcoin is unable to serve its market with its primary product - throughput capacity - at the rate and price that makes it at all competitive, then yep I'm for activating BU protocol sooner than later. As to the bogey of buggy code: What makes you think, with the potential for BU protocol's adoption by miners looking more and more likely each day, that developers on both sides haven't seen the writing on the wall and started going through the BU code with a fine toothcomb? Its another feature of Bitcoin that the vast majority of developers will follow the longest chain and will secure that chain with alacrity if their investment in Bitcoin is threatened by bugs. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:39:54
That's interesting that if Core agreed to BU, then the BU'ers would refuse to use BU? Shees!

Unfortunately, Bitcoin does not fall into one or other of the neat little boxes one can label this or the other thing we are used to labeling. So its pretty meaningless to exclude Bitcoin from being able to represent the contents of one or other of those boxes. 
In truth, we should all probably be drawing a bigger box labeled "Bitcoin" within which all of the smaller boxes fall - for reason that their contents satisfies one or other aspect, but not the whole, of what Bitcoin is.

What's the reason, do you think, for attempting to destroy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:58:15
That's one way to look at it. Here's another way to look at it: Each side wants different things and want the protocol that will deliver those things baked in right now. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:12:37
OK, Lets see who's naive: 
To reply to your first point: Bitcoin mining is a zero sum game (go read if you don't understand that)... so there will inevitably be centralization. That seems to be taking place in the hands of Wu. Maybe soon, States will get on board and swamp him. and then over time mining will centralize in the hands of dominant States. 
So, centralization of mining in the Bitcoin game is a feature not a bug. Repeat after me a few times: A feature not a bug. A feature not a bug. Also repeat: If the protocol makes a bug of it, the protocol is no longer "bitcoin" protocol. I'm surprised that this is so little understood. Maybe also repeat a few times: Bitcoin requires miners be driven by self interest because it is that self interest that will ensure they use their powers for the benefit of others in the Bitcoin ecosystem. That miners be self interested is, again, a feature not a bug. A feature not a bug... 
And what is also little understood is that this centralization under is counterbalanced but the fact that if miner's do not do what is good for others in the Bitcoin ecosystem, the market will object, prices will fall, and miners will suffer, and for miners to continue on a path that is damaging to Bitcoin is to continue on a path that damages themselves. That is another feature, not a bug. Miners cannot do what they want. They have to do what is good for the network and others in the Bitcoin ecosystem. (Maybe you can repeat that for a bit so you give it a change to sink in). 
If you've been concentrating. maybe you will have got some glimmering of an understanding that playing the ball not the man actually is possible and does have benefits. 
As to buggy code - let's compare apples with apples: How many really serious bugs has Bitcoin Core's protocol had? I'll bet many more than BU ha. Oh and here is another feature not a bug: Developers gravitate to the longest chain as it would be absurd waste of time for them not to do so. And, when the longest chain is being built using the BU protocol, that is when developers will be diving into the code to discover the bugs. And not only that, signaling for BU protocol is so strong already, that I'm pretty sure those same developers are already diving into the BU code to check for bugs, knowing that what they are likely going to have to build on in the near future. Again: Feature not a bug. Feature not a bug. Feature not a bug. Feature not a bug :))
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:01:29

@_date: 2017-03-20 08:47:18
The answer is, I understand, that the BU protocol kicks the can WAY, WAY down the road, towards when the last Bitcoin will be mined in about 2043 or so. By which time who knows what kind of animal Bitcoin will be.

@_date: 2017-03-19 13:55:08
I see you've missed the explanations by the BU developers about why they want bigger blocks. Maybe that's because you are here on r/Bitcoin where they ban explanations offered by BU advocates. That's a shame. 
I'm glad you agree segwit delivers bigger blocks "now". That's the problem. It's just "for now". And seems to me there is a strong argument that blocks bigger than even segwit can provide are needed right now, not down the road. Just a point btw, I think segwit requires 95% miner support so its a bit like flogging a dead horse to keep pushing segwit when its clear the miners will not be supporting it in those numbers. 
I see your argument is that segwit PLUS second layer solutions will alleviate the need for bigger blocksizes. How long do you think segwit will take to implement, and then how long with the second layer solutions take to implement on top of that, while we sit at 2mg blocksizes? 
I don't think your argument is very smart unfortunately. The realities of the situation (miners rejection of segwit and immediate need for more capacity for transactions on the blockchain) seem to have escaped you.

How many people hold the key to changing the Bitcoin protocol? 
That probably how many actual developers one should count up as being proper developers of Core's protocol. Aren't there only three or so? 
There may be under a handful or less of other general developers working away at the Bitcoin protocol, but they have to go through few core people with the keys, in order to get anything changed about the protocol. 
The other many many more that are always portrayed at the hundreds of people working on Core's protocol are, I'm pretty sure you can count on it, outsiders developing their own sideline programmes to sit on and around Bitcoin, who just ask for commits to facilitate their own interests, who really cannot by any stretch of the imagination be said to be part of Core. 
So, are these the over hundred top minds you maintain are working to the benefit of Core's protocol, actually?

Cool. I'm besotted by all things Bitcoin too :) 
If I may take the discourse to another level: I think a lot of the perspective Core has is a Western one, and in their use case for Bitcoin they regard it as unnecessary for Bitcoin to serve the market that wants to do things like pay for their cup of coffee or airtime or something else minor. 
However, I'm in South Africa where what is to the West a micro-payment for coffee or something is a week's wages, which means that use case can hardly be considered a micro-payment use case at all. 
For example: I work with a number of migrant workers from neighbouring country Zimbabwe.  The rate of employment in Zimbabwe is about 2% (yep). The best chance someone has of finding employment is to get (by hook or crook) a work permit here in South Africa. If they find work here, they get the equivalent of about $130 p.m. Usually they have about 5 or 10 people to support back in Zimbabwe. So they send their wages back to Zimbabwe using Western Union, who take about 20%. Or via long-distant taxi's who take a similar amount. Then their money must be deposited into a Zimbabwean bank of recipient family members and the bank charges them a deposit and other fees. And the bank then takes a "haircut" of up to 50% of what they deposit so the powers that be can pay the army and line the pockets of the political elite. And then the banks say they can only pay out money on withdrawals against that deposit in the new Zimbabwean "bond" money (Zim has no currency of its own after its inflation resulted in 3 trillion Zimbabwean dollar bills, but have now printed 80 million "bonds") which is worth less that goatshit, and that anyway they don't have enough bond money in the bank safe, so come back after 2 weeks and they many have some. 
So, the urgent use case for Bitcoin in the West is very different from the urgent use case in 3rd world countries around here. In the West, its easy to say, really, Bitcoin should not be used to buy things like a cup of coffee and those payments should all go onto sidechains etc. 
But here in the 3rd world, what are micro-payments to the West are whole month salaries and savings against common disasters like the current drought and starvation. They are not micro-payments. And the faster Bitcoin can serve that market the better. Micro-payments here will alleviate matters of life and death, and are not a matter of whether you have Latte or Cappuccino and pay with your smartphone via btc. 
These kind of micro-payments are needed not only in SA and Zimbabwe, but places like Greece, Cyprus, Argentina, Venezuela where the powers that be have been and are still raiding the savings of ordinary people, their pension funds, their bank accounts, and diminishing the value of the fiat currency through inflation. 
So, I just can't from where I stand support a Bitcoin protocol that not only treats the need for life and death payments here as frivolous "micro-payment" but also entrenches power in the hands of developers who - a la human nature everywhere - will no doubt be bought off sooner than later by that very same rotten political and economic elite that we have to deal with from where I come from. And who seem in addition insistent on siphoning off the power to make "micro-payment" onto sidechains which will no doubt also as soon as can be land up in the hands of that same rotten bunch.

If something is illegal, wouldn't that create certainty (as in, "OK, Bitcoin is banned in X country, so I'll move my business to Y country")? And if something is legal, would that also not create certainty (as in, "OK, Bitcoin is legal in Y country so I'll open my business here, Yay!")?

You can read this quote, "Cryptocurrencies will NOT become viable alternatives to fiat..." in two very different ways. First, that cryptocurrencies cannot replace the role of fiat (ie be accepted as legal tender in relation to the State, etc). And, second, that cryptocurrencies cannot replace fiat (ie cryptocurrencies will consign fiat to the rubbish heap of history). Unfortunately - and as I bet myself before taking a quick look at the article - seems the author does not explain which of these two interpretations I'm intended to understand. HO hUm
@_date: 2015-04-29 05:37:08
Its clear that, in his thinking, the blockchain and bitcoin are indivisible, so he's unlikely to be invited to a blockchain divide and conquer event. Also, there are no women of any import at all going - which would indicate that not only is there no policy to be gender inclusive, which I believe is a requirement of his accepting invitations, but even a policy to be gender exclusive. Its the "Boys can't have fun if women are around" Branson brand so makes sense

@_date: 2015-04-09 08:05:29
Here's the conundrum of what you are presupposing: Bitcoin's decentralized nature is prettymuch antithetical to the centralization upon which the success of nation States depends. I'm afraid, therefore, that there musts be a fight to the death between bitcoin and nation States, where Bitcoin's success will facilitate the end of the age of nations and where, if nations succeed in continuing to exist, that will facilitate the end of Bitcoin and other blockchain cryprocurrencies. Therefore, "nation states signing a multi-signature escrow fund securing billions of dollars in a peace agreement" will signify, to me, that Bitcoin has lost the fight. 
I've thrown my hat into the ring on the side of Bitcoin winning, and therefore will not be part of producing a white paper on how nation states will be using it to secure peace, but rather on how a blockchain-based algorithm can objectively and entirely independently provide an assessment of whether some thing amounts to a law in relation to the rule of law, and whether the application of that law (by what purports to be a nation, village, co-op or whatever) is in compliance with the rule of law.

I think the banks' "blockchain without bitcoin" is a bluff that maybe needs to be called through more discussion and explanation of the danger of banks using blockchain technology without the security of bitcoin, and how easily that can be hacked to change the history of transactions, as you say.
@_date: 2015-04-25 06:56:02
Maybe go [here]( - around 27:30min they discuss this, but I think the whole video will give you an insight into how things are working in the background. 
There is clearly a pretty good solution on the table to the block-size problem, developed by the best people in the Bitcoin space, who are testing it out using a soft fork. And they know how to make the change - other changes to Bitcoin core have been made and this will follow the same pattern - make a new Bitcoin core version with the necessary changes available for download by those who want the solution, and if the majority of miners, nodes, etc make the change others will follow the money and make the change too. So, they know how the solution will be put into play and how long it will take. The only real question is, when to put the solution out there for consensus adoption. As to this, really, blocksize is not a current problem and implementing the solution is somewhat on the back burner for now. Seems to me they are pretty much ready to make the change as and when necessary. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 06:19:40

Here's the bottom line you missed: For those who have invested in bitcoin long-term, the fluctuations in bitcoin price don't matter. For those who temporarily hold bitcoin in processing a transaction to fiat, the fluctuations don't matter.

South Africa here. I'd give it to a migrant Mozambican from Nyambane and ask him to bring 20 litres virgin coconut oil when he comes back from his Christmas holidays. 
I'd then give 20 urban domestic workers a teach in about VCO's amazink anti-fungal, anti-bacteria, anti-lice, anti-viral etc uses, and about hygiene related to products. Then I'd give them 50ml VCO each and 2 weeks for them to try it out on themselves or family members. Then I'd give them a start-up amount of 1 litre of VCO each free, plus a bunch of 50ml containers + labels + info and send them out into the world to do some good :).

Shoo - lawyer here, bit late to the party. I've spend about 10 years at the coal face researching and auditing legislation and government action, documenting the breakdown of the rule of law in South Africa since its 1994 liberation from apartheid, and I cannot agree with you more: I think Bitcoin (and other things like drones, 3-D printing, alternative energy sources, the rise of social activist networks, space exploration, etc) has already created a sea change that has put us on the path to liberate humanity from the decrepit broken down systems you refer to.
So, from that perspective, I've fundamentally reworked the concept of the rule of law--from its 2-D triangle (legislature, admin and judiciary) to 3-D triangular model (new point being a public not limited by State boundaries precisely because of things like Bitcoin etc)--and, looking at the dynamics in that model, I think the demise of States as we know them is absolutely inevitable, given that they have actually already lost control of the tools of power, such as the economy, flow of information, communications and media and so many other things.
But--and this comes from a stark realisation that there is actually no-one else thinking about what we need to put in place right now for the rule of law to exist, in whatever future which these sea change developments bring-- I think that there is a massive dearth in thinking, real thinking, about the nuts and bolts that have to be put in place right now to secure any future in which the rule of law, freedom and humanity can exist. I'm sharply aware that this failure means that it is we few who have to start building that future, right now, and the first step is to realise that we are not passive actors to the future, that it is not good enought that we just call upon a futurist to "tell us what the future holds", but that humanity has to in its masses pick up reins that are already slack, and steer us actively towards what we want. Part of my research has been to explore why there's this stagnation because people are failing to do what has already been made so possible to do by developments like Bitcoin, and I think the answer is systemic, that the old systems have to break down further than I thought they would in order for new systems to be accommodated. So, I fear we are treading a far more fine line that I used to think, between anarchy and the rule of law, the all of us.

Ta. I think when I explored this, I found out that [blockchain.info]( had no btc and had therefore ground to a halt :)
I think it uses something called sofort banking, whatever that is, which allows money transfers via sim card and cellphone.
[Barclays UK's Pingit app]( also allows that. And then there's [bitcoinfridge]( too. 
Looks like it may work, but, then I'd have to set up a sim and android etc in the UK to use it! I wonder how on earth I'd do that?! Barclays UK is a majority shareholder of a local SA bank ABSA who planned to roll Pingit out here in the 1st quarter of 2013, but no sign of it yet, and queries result in "Huh??"

This would be so amazing for Africa where cellphone's have become ubiquitous. So really, good luck! 
I'd love an app on my cell that lets me broadcast to a cloud that I want to sell/buy a particular currency (Bitcoin included) for another currency, and for another cell using the app to access the cloud and accept the buy/sell offer, with neither the buyer or seller doing anything more than wait for a confirmation on our cells. Ditto for transferring a currency as a buyer of an item to the seller of an item, in their currency of choice. That would really be putting fiat currencies, and banks, in their place :) 
Tell me, I'm in South Africa and I believe that the cellphone giants (MTN in particular, who has become a major network supplier in Africa as a whole) are poised to implement a system similar in effect to yours, but based on the Mpesa system in Kenya, and the banking system. If that's the case, I'd imagine you will encounter massive resistance from cellphone network providers in establishing your product in the developing markets you envisage.

This is ridiculous late notice to comment/contribute - such a missed opportunity to others of us who have been thinking and researching along similar lines. But there we go :(
@_date: 2013-06-09 13:06:30
Ahh. 0/10 to you for evaluating me
@_date: 2013-09-01 20:59:27
Ah.. Wish they'd said that :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:13:21
Ahhh.

You know what works incredibly well in local poor communities, is, every time you loan someone money, you tell them and the community who in the community will get that loan next, soon as they pay it back. Works a bomb :)

I've given Bitpay another go and it does not work for my purpose.
It requires that my clients go through the hoops of getting a virtual wallet, learning about and getting bitcoins into it and paying them over. 
That won't work with my clients - they just need to pay some interface their dollars (or whatever) that will allow me to be credited with that payment in bitcoin. 
I feel the bitcoin community is shoving bitcoin down peoples thoats to the prejudice of it becoming usable, so the development of what I'm looking for is lagging far far behind.

Here's what I'm thinking since last week when I realised that [Peter Thiel]( was on the Steering Committee of the [Bilderberg Group]( [here]( is currently on the go: That he and others et al (Amazon, Google, etc) are being pretty  persuasive to the billionaires, royalty and mega-powerful movers about the need to take bitcoin seriously, and that these really really REALLY big kids on the block will start to think they should perhaps take all this hocus pokus about bitcoin that they are hearing but don't understand very seriously, just in case, and so  have been dashing out of meetings at teatime with instructions to set the market for a big buyout, before returning to more sessions of Thiel selling his all-seeing Palantir eye as the panacea for moving to the new platform.

So. A nasty little club brewing. Like the Federal Reserve. Hmm

I'm in South Africa and was called by 2 newspaper reporters last week, both of whom ran a story on "why bitcoin?" 
And Monday morning the main talk radio host sounded quite fed up when he said all he hears and reads about these days is "Bitcoin this, bitcoin that, bitcoin the other, bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin, and what is betcoin anyway?"
haha

Just went up to $154

Oh, please! You completely fail to see the relationship between the bitcoin backbone and what is being built upon it is analogous to the internet backbone and what was built upon that backbone (which included dotcom bubble stocks). 
And, that you consider "it" may be a ponzi scheme means you have not the foggiest about what a ponzi scheme is, so please go away and do some thinking and research.
Until then I'll do what Sharpiedeluxe does to Darkwings_08, auto down vote whenever I see your name.

True, all :) 
And, isn't it lovely watching the conservatives and traditionalists slowly and surely become turncoats to their initial opinions!
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:23:27
cool ta.

I'd rather not know.. as long as we don't know, Bitcoin remains Stateless. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:31:49
I'm decided I'm going to believe your answer.
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:48:41
Not worth the watch - can't get past the bad diction
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:08:48
Ahh... the wonderful sound of an expert putting my cludged together thoughts into some form. Lots of lessons learnt from your small couple of paragraphs! Thanks for the reply and predictions :)

So incredibly USA-centric. Unbelievably so. Just imagine if the Bitcoin Foundation had paid more than lip-service to framing Bitcoin as an international phenomenon, and therefore approached legal defence and attempts by any State to regulate it, from that perspective. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:44:43
In this day and age, any aspect of the law of a State that conforms to the rule of law, is the law that can be drawn on in relation to bitcoin, everywhere. To that extent, it is backed by law. So, I'd not agree with you that bitcoin is not backed by law. It is, tremendously so. But, we need to co-ordinate that law in the name of and for bitcoin. I've just created [r/bitlaws]( for that, if anyone is interested in contributing to that?
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:30:41
Thanks - is it [this?]( Can't find "matonis" on Let's Talk Bitcoin's search function. Going to listen now
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:01:37
I want the opposite :( 
Currently I have an international client needs to pay me, but like 99% of my clients is 99% likely to be absolutely unfamiliar with Bitcoin, and would back away fast if I asked for payment in Bitcoin because it would seem so strange to them that it would impact on my credibility. 
So, I'm looking for an intermediary facility that would take their dollars, and provide me with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-21 07:59:29
Thanks so much for starting it:)

Let me put my different hats on for you: Baby boomer here: I've adopted btc (and fu for your presumptions). Merchant here: I've adopted btc, just quote in fiat. Lawyer here: There is no legal framework for governments, worldwide, to control btc.
Your score: 0. Sorry, go back to class.
@_date: 2013-09-01 21:03:22
Not too bad then ... though I wonder what voting rights that would buy one?
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:56:22
Cool. I've just referred him to bitx.co.za too. Mt.Gox price is around $260 vs Bitx's massively higher $389 odd. 
But, the price is so upwards'ly volatile, by the time a Bitstamp order could be finalised (the other option I've suggested to him), the price may well be that anyway.  Or it might be zero and a bit. Haha! I'll report back. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:08:22
Their website is full of "This Section is Being Written As We Speak" pages so I don't really know. 
Looks like I should revisit it later one - the structure of the website suggests that it may just provide me with tools for my clients to feel safe and sound when they pay me :)
