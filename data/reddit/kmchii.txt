according to this site   , "Assuming an average transaction occupies 570 bytes of data, then a block can contain approximately 3,500 transactions, given the 1 MB limit."
even at 100,000 transactions per block  which comes to ~28.6 MB at 3500 transactions/block, $1 usd per transaction is a prohibitive amount for daily use in many countries. Getting into bitcoin, I thought low transaction fees would possibly allown bitcoin to become a global currency but now that I know this I am not sure.
I feel like the path of least resistance for most people by the time the block rewards stop is moving to a new coin.
sorry for replying to such an old post, i have just been searching on this topic of mining reward becoming only fees and im trying to understand it

if miners are needed to verify transactions, what will happen when mining is less productive and there are less miners? Or for the future when all bitcoins are mined, how will transactions be verified?
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:13:57
perhaps there could possibly be some sort of infrastructure built on top for  verified messaging or another needed service that could piggyback off of the bitcoin blockchain to process both at once. Something not profitable in money but valuable in a utilitarian sense.
Or maybe in the future we will have a way to get cheaper electricity and mining will not cost as much to do

oh ok i see
thanks for helping with my questions
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:11:24
oh ok, the basics of it are that the miners are computers that solve incredibly difficult math problems that confirm the legitimacy of bitcoin transactions(sending bitcoins to other addresses) and when a problem is solved, the miner who solved it gets the reward. 
These days the problems require so much computing power that people pool their resources together to create essentially a supercomputer to have the chance to solve a problem and they split the reward between all the people contributing their computing power
When you hear about bitcoin mining farms they are just big buildings that they fill with mining devices

the way i understand it, it doesn't mean  the price should change much because all the halving is doing is lowering the inflow of newly created bitcoins by half. in fact, it seems to me that bitcoins should become more valuable because the supply over time of new bitcoins becomes smaller.
However, bitcoin's short history shows that the price goes through some intense changes around the time of the halving. Some people are not sure if this will happen again though, just google "bitcoin halving effect on price" and there are multiple articles on people's predictions for this time.

the bitcoin reward for miners solving a block is lowered by 1/2. 
At the moment  the reward is 12.5 bitcoins and after the halving the reward for processing one block will be 6.25 bitcoins.

interesting, thank you
when eyeballing the graph, the avg sat/byte appears to ~15 satoshis
So if there are 100 million saotshis in a bitcoin and 1 million bytes in a MB, when mining one block(1 MB) there would be ~0.15 btc in fees granted to miners?

do you know if there is any info on what percentage of income miners get atm is from transaction fees?
