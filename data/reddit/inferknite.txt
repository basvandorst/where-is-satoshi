UBI is socialist/communist in nature. We don't need more hand - outs , we need better economic freedom for all.

What's BTH?

By that time BTC might be worthless.

!remindme 6 months when BCH&gt;BTC and BTC tx fees are $100

Maps.org will soon be accepting Bitcoin Cash by the way. Expected to go live on Friday or Saturday.

People are realizing that a coin that costs $20 just to use has little future in a world where competition can produce sub 1 cent transactions. BTC will either die or adapt. Lightning network isn't close to ready and won't solve these problems. Smart money is moving elsewhere.

Maps.org (the psychedelic research group mentioned above) also accepts Bitcoin Cash as of right now. [maps.org donation page](

There is a very simple scaleable solution called increasing the blocksize. why not 1.1mb? why not 1.5 mb? why not 2 mb? At least until these scalable solutions come out. Segwit only adds 0.7mb transaction capacity. We've been waiting years for LN. Wait any longer and BTC will die as it's primary use case will have disappeared (hint it already has, you can't use it to transact anymore).

Just sent a few thousand bucks for 1 sat /byte using an alt. Why are you guys paying so much for these transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:50:09
250kb is still too high to be secure. I think 100kb blocksize should ensure high fees and more secure network due to no one wanting to use it.

Buy some bitcoin and some bitcoin cash and watch the show! Make sure you pop some pop corn because it's  going to be one hell of a ride!

It's awesome that less and less people are using BTC, which means lower fees for everyone! :)

at r/btc people are tipping each other with BCH for  $0.05 to about $5 at a time. Transaction fees of fractions of a penny to a couple of pennies make this possible.

It's only going to get worse unless you expect to never add any new users to BTC

Luke is being too liberal, we need 100kb blocks now to secure our network against attackers. The transaction backlog should be at over 500,000 transactions which would mean only smart money would transact in bitcoin with fees around $50-$100 usd. This will secure bitocoin as THE gold currency!

They will be adding BCH support soon along with a couple of other alts.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:10:47
BTC is losing support while BCH keeps adding merchants everyday. The tide is shifting
