This reminded me of Full Tilt Poker that went belly up and Pokerstars bought it and people got most of their money back.

Sounds like "privacy reasons" were "we don't have the money" reasons.

It also halved in less than a year before that when it went from $1000 to $500. Why didn't it bounce back from that first halving?

Bitcoins are the new Beanie Babies.

But can't bitcoin be replicated to death? There's hundreds if not thousands of coins. 
There is only one gold.
I'm seriously asking I do not know I'm not a bitcoiner.

Gold has uses in industry, there is gold in every phone and computer so unless you think we are going back to the stone age it will have value.

This kind of points to another problem for the average person. No one gets paid their salary in bitcoin, so to spend bitcoin you have to buy it with fiat, which you get paid in, so why not just buy the pizza with fiat which you already have. Sure if you want to buy drugs and gamble online or avoid processing fees on certain things and international transfers. But to use it to buy a pizza it's kind of ridiculous.

Okay I can see that. Although Facebook is in fierce competition with other sites. I guess time will tell. Thanks for the response.

Really? 11 trillion. Can close to a years output of the US economy be stored in bitcoin?
Not so sure about that, especially as there are other competitors.

Things can't go up forever without crashing, it is not a unique commodity. People are only buying them because they think they can make money. They can't be used except for drugs and Virgin Airlines. Even if they could be used at other places, so will other crypto currencies like litecoin eventually. Once the aura of bitcoin being a unique moneymaker disappears, it will stop going up exponentially.
