My exact thoughts right after raising my hand. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:33:33
Sorry if I misunderstand: "Let us know how you got on" = Let us know how the presentation went? 
My immediate group that I am presenting to had a deadline pushed up that needed to be met by today, which means my presentation got pushed back to next week when we have a bit of downtime. With that being said, it's no secret that this presentation is happening and people ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE. are asking me questions and some really healthy conversation has sprung up. Not only that, but I've had some peers review my presentation just to make sure it doesn't have the tone of a zealot and I've also had them tell me what is happening in their brain so I can try to address as many questions upfront as possible. Again, people reviewing the presentation has led to a lot of good conversation. 
Seems like regardless of profession, people are at least interested enough to talk about it.

I'm not sure why there is confusion about this. It says "ISIS probably is using Bitcoin to transfer money". Maybe you can elaborate on your question? 
@_date: 2015-06-07 02:36:44
Wait - there are Bitcoin commercials on TV? 
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:31:30
Yeah unfortunately I won't be using BreadWallet or Mycelium because of the backup process. A pre meeting email telling them I'm giving out money (and by the way WRITE THOSE WORDS DOWN) is a great idea and might provide enough incentive. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 01:18:03
Truthfully, ISIS probably is using Bitcoin to transfer money. It's kind of a belligerent back and forth for news outlets to say "yes they are" and for us to say "no they aren't". 
Let's just call a spade a spade and use this as proof that banks and middle men aren't needed to facilitate financial transactions. 
Regardless of it all, the U.S. dollar is still the most frequented medium for black market business, so fuck anyone who bashes Bitcoin for this same thing.

My originall thought was to snap their QR codes and send them money but as I read through these responses I am starting to believe that's a terrible idea. Not many of these people are "techy" and it really will distract from the point of the whole thing which is trying to undo their brainwashing. Maybe I'll make it optional at the end if they want to try it I'll give them free Bitcoin.

According to what I've read in this sub, regulated exchanges (Coinbase) are not cool with LBTC. Maybe buy on an exchange, shuffle your coins through a few wallets, then go buy and sell on LBTC. Wash, rinse, repeat if you move the coin back to a regulated exchange.

As someone with a minimal math background, all this picture seems to show is that the semi stable price has leveled off the 4 months average, so obviously the average and current price would be close to each other.  
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:15:10
And the 25btc reward is random, correct? Also, are you able to elaborate on "whoever creates a block"? I assume that means whoever has a large number of transactions verified and solves the algorithmic problem, but I'm trying to approach this mining question from the perspective of a n00b and don't want to assume.

I'm not speaking in terms of a good versus bad investment. I'm saying he's been with someone for 8 years and they planned on buying a house with each other but instead he took the money and did something else with it without her consent. That's a dick move. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:58:37
Except he used money they saved for a house together. Guy is a dick. I'd break up with him too.

Money they are no longer using for a house.

I guess "if it's worth it" or not is pretty subjective. Not sure how much the extra electricity would cost you and I don't know if you could be doing something more profitable with your time. 
There is a lot of really good information out there. Honestly, the White Paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto (started the whole thing) is not difficult to read and is not long. Keep an open mind and start there. Or just do some googling and stay away from opinion pieces.
I wouldn't get so much hung up on the unfamiliar terms. The average person doesn't know how cars, electricity or the internet work but no one has a problem using those things every day. 
The simplest and shortest TL;DR I can put together is this:
Bitcoin is the currency of the internet. The point is to allow two parties to transact with each other without the need of a 3rd party; just like the internet did for communications. This means that transaction costs are much lower and very low (fractions of a penny) amounts can be sent/received. The system relies on mining to both "process" transactions and control supply. Additionally, because all transactions are cryptographic functions and the network "believes" the longest chain of transactions (Blockchain), Bitcoin is remarkably secure. Essentially, chains of transactions all link together and are agreed upon by the network. In order for someone to change a transaction that had already been verified they would have to re-create every bitcoin transaction that ever existed. The entire network is trustless and only relies on immutable math and network nodes (much like the internet). 
Hope I haven't created more questions than I answered. I don't believe this is something that can be explained in a Reddit post. Perhaps you can ask r/ELI5 and someone can articulate the matter better than I.

Over the last 12ish months volatility has actually been very low; however, recent price increases mean more volatility. Some people make a killing, most just give their money to those who are killing. 
Not sure what part of the world you're in but there are some very reputable exchanges out there and some shady ones. Coinbase/GDAX, Gemini, Kraken, and itBit are among the more reputable exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:04:38
Unfortunately not. The mining is "governed" (for lack of a better term) by algorithms that increase in difficulty as supply increases. This helps to keep the supply steady. Used to be able to mine btc on any laptop but now you need a warehouse full of servers*
* You can still mine a little bit from a PC but it's only little bits here and there. Real mining is done by super computers. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:41:36
Agreed. Just wondering what the consensus is. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 03:05:30
This is a great article but it doesn't even mention Bitcoin once. Please refer to the third bullet of the community guidelines and maybe re post in or another sub.

He is instructing people to HODL because everyone always blows their load at $300 which causes the price to drop. Would be nice if this one was a little different.

I wish we could collectively as a sub decide to stop "summoning" the moon guy. The price turns downward every time.

Unless I also don't understand (seriously quite possible) I think anyone can go to any exchange and sell coin even if there isn't a buyer immediately available. Like, I think that's the actual point of an exchange. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 01:33:42
TL;DR - Settlement takes time. If I'm at bank A and you're at bank B, bank A doesn't know if you're account actually has the amount of money you are sending to me so they contact bank B and after its verified that you have the money the transfer is approved.

This entire thread is basically buttcoin for altcoin. Have some class, people. We can't both whine when people shit on us while we simultaneously shit on other cryptos or people. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:01:24
Thank you for that explanation. I suppose my limited experience doesn't allow my brain to comprehend how many people are actually in the market. I would think if what you say is true then at least every once in a while someone would get a "naw man, not right now. We need to find a buyer first" when someone tried to sell and I've never seen or heard of that happening. 
Regardless of the mechanics of buying and selling, I was just trying to say that it doesn't seem like there is a lot of NEW adoption. It's fine if people who already have coin buy and sell in order to make some money but it seems that Bitcoin doesn't have the level of adoption that someone (me I guess) would expect after exchanges and trusts and whatever are regulated, states are talking about accepting btc for taxes/payments, blah blah blah. I can just imagine hearing that a couple of years ago - I would have been floored.

Cool thanks! Fortunately I only keep a bit with Coinbase in the event I want to sell. 
I assume the private key or seed is different than the wallet address but can still be found within the wallet app?

So far the most interesting part has been the Bitcoin code and how it works. I also really enjoyed the "101" section on cryptography and how it's applicable to Bitcoin. Very cool to understand the foundation of this thing other than just read about the results of cryptography and coding and the like.

Although rude, it is a sincere question. If Mozart came back to life, made a Reddit account, and then posted in r/music someone would probably make some n00b comment. Conversely, I don't think someone who has had a Reddit account for years gets a 30pt IQ boost. Just seems like a poor judge of knowledge. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 08:11:10
The thing is that people are motivated by price, respond to incentives, and the most economic deal occurs when both buyers and sellers maximize utility. When it comes to halvening the reduced supply doesn't mean an immediate jump in price because the entire ecosystem knows it's coming. Just like if you were gonna go buy jeans and t-shirts next week but found out the supply was gonna be cut in half in a few days you'd prob go tomorrow instead of waiting. 
Truthfully, demand will need to increase otherwise it won't be profitable for miners to keep the doors open and they'll exit the market, which means the network will no longer be as secure and efficient. Same demand we have now + half the reward for mining (plus trxn fees) = reduced profits. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 02:31:48

I don't think anyone really charges ".4 btc" or anything like that. There is always a USD/EUR/CNY/etc attached to it. Merchants try to hedge volatility as much as possible. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:17:31
Not necessarily. Markets are not like plate tectonics where a large buildup of pressure over a longer period of time means a larger release.

If someone has never heard of btc I keep the convo basic and short, then (if they're even 50% interested) have them download a wallet and I transfer them $5 on the spot. 
Someone can go into all the detail in the world about how a car works but it's better to just sit down, turn the ignition, and let the experience explain itself.

Awesome, thanks. So really, the biggest reason for keeping in a wallet with a seed is to ensure that a Mt. God doesn't run off with your money? 
@_date: 2015-03-12 03:19:31
Please, ELI5 what it is I'm missing about the length of time someone has had a Reddit account? As a 23-dayer it doesn't mean I've been following Bitcoin for 23 days. I've been following since 2013 (pre-boom) and lurking on Reddit for a long time, but just recently created an account. Is this just some esoteric Reddit thing or is there a positive correlation between account age and knowledge?

One can only hope that this story hits prime time news channels. Not only publicity for Bitcoin but shows that greed is the problem and anyone is susceptible. Bitcoin isn't the vehicle for drug/weapon/people dealers and money launderers, it's a protocol and currency (that obviously has value) that anyone will use for criminal activity just like any other currency or commodity. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:00:51
This cycle has come and gone more than a few times. Seems like we've recently passed the "return to mean" phase as depicted on the far right after a massive bubble and subsequent burst. I'd say we're at the end of stealth/beginning of institutional phase. No doubt the dip in price depicted at the end of institutional will occur as many people who bought in the mid $300s will sell once the price begins to skyrocket to try to make their money back. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:17:41
I may be wrong but I don't believe those auctions happen on an open exchange and therefore would have zero effect on price.

Thanks for clarifying. I store what I don't want to trade in Mycelium or Bread Wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:13:09
That's not how this works. That's now how any of this works!
Sure you can store data on the blockchain such as (ownership or contract info) BUT that requires a minuscule amount of Bitcoin. Even still, spend a fraction of a penny for the hash but it doesn't exist until mining says it exists. What is the result of mining? BITCOIN. 
Bitcoin and the blockchain are 2 sides of the same coin. One doesn't exist without the other. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:28:40
Thanks for pointing that out - I should have clarified. I have a credit card and all KYC verified. My limits when I log into Coinbase are $10,000 buy/sell each day. I've come nowhere near that.... Ever.

You're probably right. $1,000 seems more reasonable than $10,000
They asked for information that would verify a credit report (and therefore someone's identity) like "Which of these cars do you own" and things to that effect.

@_date: 2015-02-26 03:29:51
I believe Coinbase allows $100 InstantBuy when you link a credit card and $10,000 when you give information validating your credit report. Basically you give them a shit ton of information you wouldn't normally give your bank (in the name of "compliance" of course) and they instantly transfer coin to you (literally within a minute). 
To be fair, there is obvious risk to Coinbase for crediting your account immediately before your payment clears, so they are probably just trying to mitigate risk by selling information or charging your credit card if payment bounces. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:45:40
Although it's shitty and certainly disagreeable, it's very legal under the BSA and PATRIOT ACT which give banks disclosure of what you do with their account (not necessarily an individual's money). If a bank deems BTC transactions as a money laundering risk (most do) then they can legally send these letters. Buying BTC is not illegal but just like any business, a bank can dictate what you can or cannot do with their product.

I should have elaborated. Companies like Visa "can" charge those fees because the market is willing to pay them for the service provided. If Bitcoin hypothetically blew up and took the role that currently belongs to Visa than individual exchanges could charge whatever rate they want (right?).

Ever see a warning label on a can/bottle of household cleaner saying not to misuse the product? That's their way of a bank letter. I totally disagree with a bank giving someone a hard time for buying/selling btc, but they are 100% allowed to ask people not to do it in their account. Same logic behind a restaurant manager throwing a patron out for acting like an asshole.
