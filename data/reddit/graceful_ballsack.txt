porn is one of the most searched things on the internet, if not the most

yup. But they dont *want* to restrict certain websites. What they want is more money, and they get that by offering "premium" services.
edit: they dont want to restrict certain websites YET.

Because we already pay for access to that bandwith, and sometimes dont even get that (up to Xmb/s). A bit is a bit is a bit. It shouldnt matter if it is a bit from netflix or a bit from porn hub.

Wrong, that was over a century ago from TODAY! 
In this age, the Federal Reserve prints USD. It is not a part of the US government. It is owned and controlled by globalists. That is why the government buys its currency from the FED.

shit, you too? how much did you lose?
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:50:13
It wasn't a multiplying bitcoin. It was a twitter user John McAffee stating a 500btc giveaway, what you send is doubled. Then they linked to a 3rd party news site and an article written by someone else about the giveaway, then a separate link to... steal your btc.
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:02:54
It was from McAffee's twitter and posted by a third party news site. I lost 0.53.

Nice name, just FYI a heat inside of a heart is known by the FBI to identify a girl lover, a heart next to a heart is a child lover :

okay. Now explain it like you're new to bitcoin, please.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:17:58
Thank you for the thorough analysis. What would you say is the starting of this bubble, or do you think this is steadily rising due to larger accessibility to businesses, so when it pops the drop wont be as far as before?
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:52:45
What hardware wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:35:14
Cryptos are a huge threat! This is great news.
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:34:24
because it always oscillates between highs and lows. Politically, we have the largest "attack" on the fed. The politicians enforcing this USD agenda are now being investigated. Once their testimonies shed light and bring in other USD enforcing members, the fed will panic and they will attempt to crash the economy in order to blame it on trump. when the USD starts to fall, the BTC will rise.

Great question!
The oligarchs control everything because they stole it. How? The Federal Reserve. 
JP morgan spread fear by creating a major stock crash. He used this to push the federal reserve onto the public saying it was a financial regulator which could prevent crashes. So the USA gave away their gold backed currency and printing presses when the FED tried to pass the constitutional amendment. (they never received the number of votes to be ratified.) A few years later the Fed removes the gold backing of the dollar. A few years after that, the US government collects the county's gold under penalty of law. 
At this point the super wealthy now controlled the currency its self. Couple that with money in politics, and it should be clear that the public never stood a chance. This was theft of our currency and democracy.

One and the same.

kicking myself for not selling at 2700 when I could've bought at this price!
bitcoin will hit 3k on friday
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:39:22
You must understand that the government does not represent you, it represents the oligarchs in power. Those oligarchs see bitcoin, a decentralized currency, as a threat. IT IS AND THATS THE BEST FUCKING THING ABOUT IT.
The oligarchs will continue to attack ANY currency that threatens them. At this time, it is bitcoin. 
The elites control everything because they STOLE it and they continue to DEMAND it. Bitcoin is new technology which removes the need of a banking system. It gives the power these elites have stolen back to the people. That is something they cannot let happen as it threatens their very existence.
THIS IS GOOD NEWS! THIS MEANS BITCOIN IS SO SUCCESSFUL, IT IS A THREAT TO THE ROTHCHILDS!
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:13:51
no, but I want to sell within a week, and buy within the next
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:46:11
Yes, I hate all Jews because one family has been destroying the planet by forcing the US to invade other countries not using their fiat currency.
Dumbass, would I be an Islamaphobe if the Mohammads controlled the Fed?
Would I be an [insert chinese version] if the dragon family controlled the Fed?
Do not try to drive a wedge between peasants, we are all in this together.

Bitcoin DOES remove the need for banking. You are your own bank. no fees, no interest, no credit, no debt based economy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:26:53
I see what you're saying. People need loans. However, the banks see Bitcoin as a threat! Considering the number of stock crashes orchestrated to consolidate wealth, their desire to remove bitcoin makes it feel like they're attacking our freedom. Bitcoin is beneficial towards the public if only because it loosens the grasp of the elites.
