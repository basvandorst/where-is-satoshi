hi barbadello! I'm currently working on an cryptocoin social network. It was a project intended to create a extremely dynamic web-based OS. When I noticed the tools that ethereum began to provide for interfacing with the blockchain I realized that this is perfect for a decentralized, highly dynamic, cryptocoin-based social network. I've been integrating the ethereum libraries into my project and it's coming along. I have not talked much about my project but seeing your post I thought I would mention it. Currently it sits at  but I'm not sure if I want to keep that name or not. Technically the site is already setup to do basically everything but for it to be convenient for the standard user, some basic tools need to be implemented first, and so the site isn't very instructional at the moment.
EDIT: Being a bitcoin sub, I just wanted to mention that I use ethereum for the smart contracts and eventually I'd like to incorporate as many coins as possible, bitcoin as highest priority. However bitcoin doesn't provide smart contract tools as convenient as ethereum does at the moment so thats why im using ethereum for now.

Bitcoin isn't really anonymous at all when you take into consideration all the spying. Monero might be your best option for anonymous transactions, for now.

He seems to be a serious advocate of privacy and bitcoin and after listening to his Mega intro I take him to be at least somewhat intelligence, unlike the vast majority of humans. I'm excited about the announcement and I'll be supportive of Mega.

why does it have to be compared to them? I've run calculations with $0.1/kwh and althought not millions of dollars, still can generate a profit, so why do you say little point?
@_date: 2015-12-29 03:54:55
yeh, but not sure how you mine dollars.

Why do you say everyone is more than happy with centralized serverices? People haven't had a choice until now.

I'm interested in dabbling in mining and potentially more than dabble. Can I run miners at home with significantly more energy use (do energy providers care?). If not home, where can I keep the miners (data-center, warehouse?)
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:23:02
I don't understand. The difficultly algorithm seems pretty straightforward to me in order to maintain an average 10 minute block mining interval. How on earth do they plan to tamper with that?
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:58:39
few ideas: use localbitcoins or other sites to find people locally to exchange with cash. Or, just use coinbase or circle, convert to monero or zcash, make some transactions, and then convert back to bitcoins and voila, anonymous coins.
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:39:15
Coinbase has worked pretty well for me in 3 or so years I've been using it.
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:03:09
yeah, i just wanted to see a more legitimate source regarding actions by China, they can move the market more than anyone else can..
@_date: 2016-11-04 17:42:08
So your saying a blockchain is useless in a multi-party process where trust is a big security weakness? The specific problem your talking about is double-spend, AKA multiple parties agreeing on a state, and how is that not what killerstorm is suggesting this be a good application for?
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:24:00
Betcoin is pretty good
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:27:57
never sell. I would just buy them back and hodl.
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:52:34
I agree moon but in the short term, when will those cheap coins be? are we going to see 500 soon or what.... bitcoin is crashing to hell
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:12:33
I exaggerated the crash I know, but my primary concern is news sources, I cant imagine that the price is this affected by just a zerohedge article.
@_date: 2016-11-04 17:55:51
can you explain what you mean a little more? i dont really get what your saying. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:58:11
lol. ok your right
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:30:40
u sure? it will be magical fun
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:15:35
Bitcoin could flop. There is a sizeable chance that bitcoin could become extremely valuable in 5-10 or more years, by extremely I mean tens, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions. It is extremely uncharted waters we are in. What I can be more sure of than bitcoin going to the moon, is cryptocoins in general going to the moon. Therefore a proper investment would be some profile among various coins (most altcoins suck though so stick to a few). Bitcoin currently is poised as the best but ethereum could have an even bigger growth potential. This is all speculation but in general, yes you should definitely invest in bitcoin if you are considering it.

Welcome!!! The greatest thing you can do is learn and use bitcoin, share it with your friends, get them to understand. There is no bitcoin account, there is no permission you must get from anyone, no descrimination based on age, gender, status, etc. Now if you have a bank account, you can buy bitcoins from an exchange by linking to your bank account. If you don't have a bank account, there are many other ways to get bitcoin, including localbitcoins.com, begging, selling things on openbazaar, finding out something people with bitcoin want that you can give, etc etc etc. Bitcoin wallets are software that can hold, send, and receive bitcoin. They can be an app on a phone, a software on your computer, or even a web wallet (like blockchain.info's wallet).
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:17:58
that will make all other miners much less profitable, almost by half right?
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:44:30
The best way I can respond to this is that bitcoin is peer-to-peer fundamentally. It is not impossible to get bitcoin. Someone, like me, is willing to give you bank info, put BTC in escrow, and finalize the trade when the money arrives in bank. Voila. Or meet someone in person with cash. Or sell items on openbazaar. Point is there is someone else who has bitcoin and is willing to sell you some, a lot of bitcoiners are willing to do that including myself, (pm me if you want). It is not impossible! p2p is king.
@_date: 2016-02-15 22:21:09
I understand your viewpoint. I think it does bring up something worth discussing. The fact is bitcoin is amazing on its own and one of the main goals for many of us is to reach out to more "users" like you because that is the dream many of us have: global digital currrency with all of the special properties of bitcoin. I don't think every user has to be a maintainer, I think the demand for bitcoin's existence will dictate whether or not it survives. Ways in which "users" can help the system are things like: running a full node, running a mining operation, simply donating to those who support the network one way or another (such as developers which have your interests in mind) and educating other people.
@_date: 2016-02-12 06:14:35
Am I correct in thinking that because the lightning network works on top of bitcoin, that you can choose to ignore it if you want and just use bitcoin by itself?
@_date: 2016-02-15 21:59:00
Dear user,
Bitcoin is decentralized. Saying "please" and telling us how you only want to use it does nothing. Your stance on end-user mentality is most applicable to a typical service provided by a private company. There are many ways you can support the network but asking for it to "just work" is not one of them. If you enjoy bitcoin so much, do some research!

Hi, I would love to dive into the bitcoin's scripting system, however I have a concern. It seems Core and most miners don't relay non-standard transactions. For whatever reason, doesn't that prevent bitcoin scripters from doing anything fun?
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:32:26
wheres the link to the whitepaper?
@_date: 2016-10-30 01:18:23
Me: downloads, compiles, fires up node.
Node: "SegWit ready, sir"
vroom vroom lets do this!!!!!
@_date: 2016-10-05 19:58:04
apparently you can still get arbitrary script transactions mined, via p2sh transactions
@_date: 2016-10-22 02:12:26
i think thats possible. would be a very robust coin, no need for any scripting
@_date: 2016-10-05 17:13:38
Blocks come from anyone who successfully finds a hash with a particular property, of the pending transaction list. When they find this hash, they put together the other info into the block (like timestamp, etc) and broadcast that block to the network. Finding that hash is difficult and therefore if you find it, the network allows you to fit a special transaction in it to give yourself a bonus of bitcoins, and also collect the transaction fees.
your wallet simply signs the transaction you want to make and broadcasts it to the network. BY including a fee, you incentivize miners to take your transaction and mine it into a block, so they can collect the fee, as I mentioned above.

If you think about it, blockchain consensus is incredibly inefficient when it comes to scalability, since every single node process ALL transactions. It's been the major issue to figure out in bitcoin and crypto. There is so much room for growth that even raising the blocksize by, say, 3x, bitcoin can easily blast past the 1MB size and we'll be in the same predicament with 3MB not too long from now, while harming decentralization. A primary scaling solution is so-called "offchain" transactions which are kind of genius and allow for essentially infinite scaling without loss of decentralization or security (Lightning Networ). If I've gotten something horribly wrong please someone correct me.

i must be lucky but i haven't had a single issue with coinbase in the 6 or so years I've been using them. hopefully this doesnt curse me

whoa really, haha my bad. well ive been with them for a while
