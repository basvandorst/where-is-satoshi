Pretty cool though no? Such large blocks, such little fees, such decentralisation WOW

Yes, which is stupid when you sit back and look at the picture, why was there such backlash against doing this in the first place? I think the answer is external forces (bankers/wankers)

I never specified anything about 'when', shidiot

It's the other way around this time though!
BTC Cash is a mere doubling of blocksize whereas BTC Segwit incorporates hugely radical protocol changes deviating much further from the original.

I have a good feeling about this decentralised not-segshitcoin.

Wrong there were no large code changes necessary to increase the blocksize, shows what you know lol

Basically the first block of Bitcoin cash ever is seen clearing basically the entire mempool in one fell sweep above ;)
*mempool being a pool of all the live transactions waiting to be mined, or validated

What are fees looking like between the two?
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:29:02
A flawed design? They just doubled the blocksize, everything else in the design is still being used by your chain stoopid!
I'm not declaring anything.
Oh and there have been 8 blocks, crazy huh? Fuck me there must be some serious hidden hash power somewhere there hasn't even been a difficulty adjustment
