Just hold it till the end of the year, or longer if you can. The long-term price trend is looking to increased prices, greater than most traditional investments.

Just in case, double-check under your security settings that there's not a 2FA for "Funding". Just to be sure. Otherwise, it might just be that they're blocking the transaction for some other reason and will get in touch with you or respond shortly I guess. Hope you can get it fixed nonetheless!

It would be like getting consensus about climate change from the public, when in fact we depend on scientific research and analysis to inform us through qualified scientific consensus.

Exactly, but any publication you read makes out that because majority hash power is moving towards BU, they make it sound like somehow the market is slowly supporting BU and simply omit the fact that the market is not based only on hash power.

I remember but not sure the exact price. But this time is way more serious. The HF could halve values easily. There's a chance to make a lot of money and/or very easily lose it all on the wrong chain.

This is really fucked up. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:23:16
When you say "break it up into multiple chains", is this similar to the "subchains" idea? Or something different like multiple parallel chains that converge into the main chain?

If anyone needs help setting this up on a Mac I can help out. You need to set a manual address for your machine. If your firewall is on, need to allow incoming connections (should be enabled automatically though). If you're using an airport router, need to add a DHCP reservation port 8333 for your machine's mac and ip addresses and open TCP port under port settings for 8333.

As always, so well articulated! Thanks Andreas!
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:22:36
I noticed the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:24:14
One thing I noticed is that the "dbcache" setting (measured in mb of RAM) has a significant effect on how fast the chain syncs. Depending on how much RAM your computer has, try increasing this setting (the default is only 100mb). 
If you have 16gb of RAM, try setting "dbcache=8000" (i.e. 8gb of RAM), or whatever you're comfortable with. You can always change it later.
Some other settings that might help: "assumevalid=1" – I'm not sure if this only helps in the initial sync or if it will help with ongoing sync as well.
To keep your blockchain size down you probably already have "prune=1" enabled, although I'm pretty sure this won't speed up synching, just prunes older blocks from your local chain.

Lots of paperwork and red tape. Also understaffed and too many people. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:30:18
For sure. I feel like this time is different now we're looking at a real HF. The price might not recover for a year or so which is fine if you can hold out long enough. 
Either way too late to sell now. Only options are hold or double down and buy.

In Brazil it's a fucking mission for anyone, even people with money, to open a bank account here.

Lots of red tape, monopoly of market, lack of will to open accounts, under staffed banks, too many customers still doing in-person banking, lazy/incompetent staff (usually at national government run banks). I could go on. It's a pain in the ass for everyone here.

You probably have a second 2FA for withdrawals which they label "funding" which is a little confusing I know. Also check that you're not receiving a confirmation email also to confirm the withdrawal.

It's worth noting that even Roger Ver himself admits that Segwit should be implemented. Just that he'd rather HF the coin first in a way that centralizes mining further and is actually highly complex to get the mechanics just right. Although BU supporters seem to think it's as simple as upping the block size. This is why I think BU has gained some traction as a concept for people who don't take the time to read about each implementation. Speaking of which, I'd recommend reading the chapter on Segwit in the second edition of Mastering Bitcoin. I'm pretty sure most people should be able to understand it. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:37:07
If you receive PayPal in Brazil from the States the fee is around 10%. Remember it's different from country-to-country. This is what really fucking bugs me about BU people bitching about how high Bitcoin transaction fees are. For fucks sake, I can receive a salary instantly and for like 50c. It's a billion times better than any other option available. Even if I had to pay $10 per transaction it kills anything else available here.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:01:14
Good work, looks fantastic!
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:16:47
 Not to come off condescending but you should look into both scaling solutions further and the people behind them and you'll find Segwit actually makes sense as the next step before any on chain scaling is in the works.

I wonder how much a node with these settings really contributes to the overall decentralisation and security of the network in the end though right?
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:24:24
Can someone please explain in more details how to split coins in Electrum. I'm usually pretty good at working this stuff out, but some of the command lines aren't obvious to me what they do exactly, for example:
    electrum -D &lt;directory&gt;
Is this duplicating my electrum directory? What is the &lt;directory&gt; variable there, like is it the directory where my wallet is (i.e. ~/.electrum) or the new directory (i.e. ~/.electrum-btc or btu)? 
Also, it wasn't clear to me how to work out which servers are core and also how to remain connected to a specific server via tor?
If someone could write a more fool proof version of this, would be great. If there's a fork, I'd like to split and sell btu as fast as possible. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:00:27
I also gave up on trying to setup an Electrum server. Seriously difficult.

You can't ignore the fact that legitimate businesses dealing in bitcoin have legitimate reasons to obfuscate identification associated with transactions. Imagine in business your competitors knowing all of your transactions. Or imagine making public every cash transaction you personally make. 
Of course there will be people who use technology for terrible things, but we can't punish everyone for this, and in any case, there's no shortage of alternatives for criminals so any attempt would be futile anyway. Really think about it.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:12:19
I found that increasing the dbcache memory significantly speeds up the initial sync process. The default was set to 100mb and would take almost a month to sync. I increased it to 8000 and it synced over night. Afterwards you can decrease it again to something reasonable for your machine. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:13:05
This comment doesn't make any sense. Obviously it's better to peg a sidechain within the same currency otherwise you're managing value between bitcoin and an altcoin like bcash. Even if you've received an equal amount on both chains, eventually you'll spend one or the other and so this chain duopoly setup is far from ideal.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:11:45
One of the main problems seems to be that when you initially bought into alt coins, according to the wording of your post, you were measuring profit/loss in dollars. Now that bitcoin has increased in value, you seem to be measuring profit/loss in terms of bitcoin. 
A decision should be made prior to trading as to which currency your trading against, whether it be dollars or Bitcoins.
I'm not sure I'd hold the alt coins though in the long run. There's a higher chance most go to zero than you catching the breakout. And as you've mentioned, even if you catch a breakout, it seems you're set to sell at break-even prices so you'll miss any potential upside. 
Considering this scenario, you might be best off converting all back to Bitcoin at during favourable market events. Perhaps in November when the 2x FUD starts.

Thanks for the clarification, and appreciate you taking the time!
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:51:10
Can someone speak to the rebuttal here just so I can fully understand. 
This guys saying that because of the order of transactions (sorting by fee-per-byte) for Antpool blocks, this indicates that asicboost may not have been used in mainnet?
My personal thought is that there has to be a financial incentive for Bitmain to block Segwit. I can't understand why anyone would block it otherwise, but in any case, I'd like to understand the above response.

Exactly what I was thinking when reading this!
@_date: 2017-04-12 01:47:59
The fundamental reason is that most people just don't need it. It is difficult to understand and in some respects to obtain also. It wasn't until I moved from Australia to Brazil that I realised just how crap banking can be in non first world countries and for me bitcoin was easily the most efficient way for cross border, and legal, business transactions. Bitcoin probably needs some kind of world inflation / debt crises to spur a tipping point in adoption. Perhaps the break up of the Euro?

Apparently they hold the patent for it in China so my guess is it's unlikely anyone else could use it to their detriment.

Been doing this for more than a year now. Bitwage is the way to go otherwise your employer needs to go through an exchange. It's way faster than going through banks for me in Brazil and save more cash in the process. But for US to CAD you'd probably be better off receiving Fiat and making your own entry trades on an exchange like QuadrigaCX.

Hi Nikos, sorry if this is a silly question but how does Coinsimple make money? There don't seem to be any fees involved.
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:53:25
I can see how it might seem crazy that people think bitcoin or cryptocurrencies will replace banks, but if you look far enough out (50 to 100 years possibly), there is a strange future ahead of us and many possibilities out there.
Sometimes I consider what effect machines might have participating directly in the economy, by literally participating with autonomous purchasing power. If we speed up the flow of money to the point where super micro-transactions flow as instantaneously as we stream video online – the effects are almost unimaginable right now to most of us. 
As far as I can tell, banks aren't positioned to take advantage of these changes, as traditional Newspapers and perhaps the music industry weren't when the internet took hold.
I think there's a chance these types of technologies change completely what we think money is, eventually. Might be a ways off, but it's certainly a possibility at some stage. Of course, that's not to say there's not a lot of people simply in bitcoin to make a quick buck too.

Ok thank you mr software for your enlightening comments. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:15:08
I think the opposite is true. You should buy as much pre August 1st before any possible fork takes place. Pre fork bitcoins will be worth more to every one while this blows over and there'll be a squeeze for guaranteed pre fork coins. Otherwise you don't know what you're buying. Coins could get reorganised worse case scenario you lose em.

Might not be deployed but they've been around for at least a year or two. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:43:33
I'm expecting at least $5,000 if Segwit is cleanly activated. Once the dust settles though, it could retrace anywhere back to $3,000 (previous support) until further developments begin to really take effect like Lightning Network, micro-transactions etc. Then we'll see steady price increases into 2018 or some sideways action.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:58:10
