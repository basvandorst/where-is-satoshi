Just some advice about trading:
Make sure you have done your research before beginning to trade. The majority of people lose A LOT of their money attempting to trade. Do not think you will do better for some reason. They all think the same.

It's never over. It's just one thing after the other but people and bitcoin as a whole will become stronger :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:30:58
no, it's worth nothing anymore, so you should just throw it away to me

Independent Reserve and Coinjar are what I used to get started. Of course, you need to register and get verified but that's not difficult. Storing it can be done on a paper wallet, which is good since you want to hold. Having it anywhere else makes it really easy to trade... and most people that start trading WILL lose quite a bit of money. I recommend putting it in Bitcoin rather than the others, but just watch the news once in a while to make sure it doesn't go to shits.

stealing bitcoins to shoot into open water

@_date: 2017-08-15 10:27:30
not yet. going to need quite a lot of selling. if it does drop, down to around 2950 lowest
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:07:59

@_date: 2017-09-03 05:41:26

I like how you went from regulations to shutting down and doom so quickly. Sell everything you have so I can buy it off you.

doesn't matter if they sell for lower though as long as it was for profit. much more gains buying low selling high compared to holding.
