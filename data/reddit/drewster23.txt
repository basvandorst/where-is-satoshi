Working for a runescape gold seller really taught me a lot about Venezuela. For those that don't know in Venezuela runescape is very popular to grind gold and sell it for &lt;1 USD/mill.  As this money allows them to feed their family during extreme financial and political hardship in their country. Literally people depend on the game in order to live. So I empathize greatly for you and your people.

Generators that cost 60-80$usd few weeks ago now going up to 600$ due to power crisis. If you didn't buy one before its almost impossible to afford one now.   I  employee Venezuelans and its pretty much mandatory now, as without power they can't work.

I think if your in a situation or talking to a person that you have to worry about talking about financials at the possible
 risk of them coming for you.  You should reevaluate who you talk to or what you say to them.  Im not telling randoms how much cash I have in my house. So I'm not telling randoms how much Btc I hold.

I work in an industry that is closely related to VZ and Bitcoin, and bitcoin is literally saving these citizens and helping them feed their family, by having a safe stable currency to rely on. There is a huge blackmarket for it.

Which Is better than 6000% inflation which Venezuela experienced in one year. It doesn't matter that btc went down if your only other choice is one that becomes worthless each day/week.
