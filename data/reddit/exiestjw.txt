Everything is where it is supposed to be for me now but I've had to do everything more than once to get it to "go through" lately. For example I got some LTC not too long ago and the first time I tried it said my bank account wasn't verified, tried a few seconds later and it just said "error", third time I got my LTC.
That sounds a lot different than what happened to you though, not recommending you "try again"

There has never been an internet before net neutrality until today.
In the 1930's, common carrier regulations were put in place to stop the price gouging that was going on with the new at the time phone system.
Starting 20 years ago, ISPs began to fight for asignation that the service they provided did not fall under common carrier laws. But the fact is that what the internet is, a communication medium, was subject to these laws.
In 2015 this was codified - internet telecomms were officially designated as communication systems and subject to common carrier laws.
Now that these rules have been dismantled, the tollbooths on the communcation infrastructure will begin to appear again.
Notice how your comment has no real meat - no details or even examples of how "the internet before net neutrality took over the world". The reason is because you are just here flat out lying to people.

Just curious as to why yet another wallet instead of just picking the one you feel is the best and contributing to it to make it better?
I suppose there will always be room for one more wallet in this space but is the state of crypto wallets so bad that we need to start from scratch on one?

Credit card processing companies make it against their terms of use to charge a fee for credit card processing. For example when you go by groceries, theres not a line item on the receipt that says 'credit card fee'.
But they charge fees. In fact, its probably &gt; 3%, I bet even touching 4%.
The entity you are conducting business with isn't going to eat that fee out of the kindness of their own heart. So whats happened is the price of goods across the entire economy are ~ 4% more expensive because of the payment system.
Because of the way its set up, Joe Schmoe says "I don't pay fees for processing."
I suspect eventually with bitcoin you won't see the fees so explicitly either. But right now we're working so close to the base tech that we're exposed to it.

This is its infancy. Its first few "days" of life. In the beginning of the internet you couldn't make a telephone call and use the internet at the same time. "Such great technology." But people found ways to make it work. Now you don't even need a wire for the last mile. The people who but the effort in to making it better at the beginning became filthy rich for doing what seems like in hindsight very little common sense work.
Thats how its going to be in 20,30,50 years from now with crypto.
All these issues will be completely forgotten and the infrastructure will seem like common sense because of how well it will work.

Even this phrasing, while accurate, is still a little FUDdy. A better way to phrase it is that this broker isn't going to provide this particular service.

In the United States, if your government is not doing what you want it to do then it is your civic duty to get involved and campaign on your beliefs and get people to vote for you and put you in charge based on those beliefs.
If you do not do this, then it is personally your fault that things are not the way you want them. Theres nothing to ask anybody why something is or is not happening, the answer is "because you didn't do it."
If you do this and people don't vote for you, you have proof that what you think is the best course is not a priority for most people.

You do pay fees. But they are built in to the price of the item. The card processor charges the merchant fees, and merchant is not going to pay it out of pocket. So the only way they can recoup the cost is by increasing the cost of the product.
Its a little more complicated than this, but basically the price of everything in the world would be about 5% cheaper if it wasn't for credit cards.

In the united states (and many other countries) you have to declare profit on anything you sell to the IRS in order for it to be taxed.
If you buy a car for $1,000 and sell it for $2,000 you must declare the $1,000 profit as income on your income tax return and pay taxes on it. Of course not many people would, and its extremely unlikely that tax offices would do anything about it if they found out you did - it costs them more to spend time on it than they could recoup in income tax. But you're supposed to.
So this isn't unique to bitcoin - its just how tax laws work when you sell property.

Of course not. Please use reading comprehension. Regardless if the platform is a scam or not, you have to deposit funds in to the system to be able to use it.

Whenever I see posts like this I wonder about the user's trading patterns because they never divulge that information. Coinbase isn't a day trading platform.

I don't think it was said in an offensive manner, just matter-of-fact.
We certainly don't want to chase you away, but its definitely true that supporting services for bitcoin is thin right now. This is getting better every day, and investors are starting to put money in to building tech. If you get in now, you're definitely an early adopter.
That said, the rest of us here have figured it out. Most of us aren't rocket scientists, so its a little hard, but not THAT hard.

How do you assign unique attributes for each coin? For example, for the mp3 example, how do you map a coin to a particular song?
Or along the "music festival token" theme, say concert tickets where you're assigned a seat, how do you denote which coin goes to which seat?

@_date: 2014-05-04 05:00:30
Obviously. But you didn't propose a solution. All things being equal, integrating in to the existing card network is probably the cheapest route.
As additional services are added on to bitcoin transfer process, its going to be extremely unlikely, or in my opinion most likely impossible, to compete with credit card merchant services in a manner that renders them obsolete.
I think a full service bitcoin merchant service, its only selling point is going to be no per transaction fee. You're still looking at a 1/2/3% cut in transaction order for a processor to get enough out of the system to make it worthwhile.

Hrm, yes I'm just getting started with bitcoin and this is interesting.

This is why I bought mid april and when I started regretting not buying sooner. People were talking about bitcoin "crashing" but the drop stabilized above pre-bubble valuation. It wasn't a crash, its been continually going up and had a brief period where it went up quickly and came down a little.
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:15:04
I'm still just starting out too, so others please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, this may not answer all of your questions but I'd like to try to start answering:
You can trade in person directly to a wallet address. Most people on localbitcoin.com charge a hefty markup on the price of bitcoin, so it might be cheaper to get it at an exchange (while being less anonymous). So its a trade-off.
Bitcoin stays on the block chain, so its not really transferred from wallet to wallet. The idea is that you prove you know the private key for a transaction and that means the bitcoin is yours. This means that you CAN transfer to an offline wallet. I believe the suggested practice is to store your keys in an offline wallet, and then set up a listening wallet that can keep track of how much bitcoin you own. I'd like to do this. So no a broker is not necessary.

@_date: 2014-05-17 16:51:10
By being a [market maker](
The 'no fees' thing is a marketing ploy. They sell the customer the security at a premium on top of the exchange rate. They'll buy your security with the premium below the exchange rate.
In return they provide liquidity to the market by making people feel comfortable that you'll be able to buy and sell when you want.

I'm not going to get in to the details of other ways to do it, but when you insert the device in to USB and mount the drive, its no longer offline. You might as well use your system's hard drive.
OP is correct, you haven't added any additional security.

Sounds sane to me.
You have the ability to transfer currency in bitcoin quickly and easily to other people, eliminating the need for high cost services like western union and wire transfers, but can also spend your bitcoins anywhere credit and debit cards are accepted.

If you throw away the government, and then try to figure out how to build infrastructure, you're going to end up right back where you started, because the only people that are willing to participate are the people that already are.

Regardless of your volatility "education" or whatever authority you're trying to claim, you cannot change the fact that a bitcoin I earned in july would only allow me to purchase half as much value as I provided for the bitcoin I accepted.
I already factored in the chance of volatility when I purchased my house, car, and electronics because I bought them for their utility, not their value. Bitcoin has no utility, so what you're stating here is basically unintelligible.

The idea is shortly before retirement you move your funds to places where there is less risk of loss.

Authy is extremely buggy when changing devices or numbers. I switched to an android device to ios device and never got another SMS trying to log in to coinbase. I followed all the reset instructions except for pestering the shit out of authy.
Installing the authy app got me going again... for now.
I know your problem is a little different, but hopefully the right person will read this and realize changing devices does not "just work" at all.

Its downvoted because its a stupid point. Its not like we don't get anything for our taxes. In fact, we get services unparalleled to that of all of the rest of human history. Show me a better setup, and I'll be first in line.

True, but if nobody had faith that the government would be able to make its interest payments, nobody would want it so USD would be worthless as well.
The US government is only as strong as the US dollar, and the US dollar only has strength because we all agree that it does.

I think he was somewhat sarcastically saying that they're pointless.

In very simple terms, its being legitimized.
For example, nobody, including the government, would raise their eyebrows too much if you owned 1000 shares of and was actively trading GOOG. Its just standard commodity trading.
But people might get weird about you doing the same thing with 1000 shares of BTC.
Its becoming more normal.

He's not sticking his neck out. He's playing the "Things I'll do if I win the lottery" game.

Sure. When I bought mine, they sat at less than half the value I paid for them for over a year and a half. You just never know, but yes the more longevity they have the more the odds of it holding value increases.

vultr, gandi, overstock, dell, microsoft, newegg
also, any site that uses stripe for payments could accept bitcoin relatively easily
Its not perfect, but its getting better, and in another 10 years if BTC value becomes stable or keeps increasing it will become the easiest way to pay.

Unless the customer is already holding bitcoin, then your suggestion is laughable. Step one on your invoice cannot be 'Acquire Bitcoin'

In 2013 my contractor in asia and I gave about $2,000 to paypal. Since we switched to bitcoin we've spent about $100 in remittance fees including moving in and out of fiat.
So I don't know why you'd claim something like that. You sound really dumb.

I think teamviewer is easy to brute force because the session ids are all numbers and the passcode is a four digit number.
