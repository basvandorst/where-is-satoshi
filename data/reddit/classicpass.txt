Big deal, China made the sane announcement last year, it only dipped temporarily to come back up 2 folds.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:04:48
What an awesome teacher to take initiative.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:40:01
Yup and a pretty important transaction is supposed to finally drop tomorrow after 14 days
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:05:03
Btc dropped 50% wtf are you talking  about?
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:24:42
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:35:55
How is this true.? Why would coinmarketcap be the reference if those kinds of math are used?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:48:46
Oh man, please keep us updated, fellow Canadian here and was on the verge of making a move this year. But wondered how clunky or smooth everything would go.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:50:58
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:24:29
Has nothing to do with. It moves 7% daily

Islam isn't very rational nor consistent nowadays. Better leave the crypto world to the adults.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:06:16
That's why I use coincards.ca to get awesome gift cards. ALOT of different cards are available
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:30:28
People kill themselves over much less than that nowadays
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:12:06
I've received a deposit from them Today that I've initiated last Monday if that makes any good news to anyone.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:06:38
I do actually, I was going to try txaccelrator, but I'd rather have the transaction cancelled instead of having it processed ( if thats even possible) its from one wallet to an exchange. And that exchange has been down for some time now.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:48:15
Protip, don't leave your coins on a exchange
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:34:40
GTFO here
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:20:16
Just call their weak hand and tell them they're scared and it's normal, because bitcoin is a real threat to them.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:32:27
I thought bitcoin was unceizable?
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:44:08
Again. Like they said in 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 20...
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:31:00
I buy from coinbase with capital one....

Ok and? It grew 15 times since. Who can we blame now?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:08:50
Cause once the check is in, then you're in the bitch
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:02:16
Buy it from bitcoin ATMs
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:21:28
It's what I read out here in comments , but wasnt 100% sure , thats why today I'm asking for real, because every forum has a different answer and I'm not tech savy enough to read into the blockchain's details to understand the core of it. I'd just like a straight foward answer / option from now on.
I've heard taht the mempool would flush unconfirmed (0 ) transactions after a certain amount of time, it would be sent back to the sender's wallet for another try , at a higher fee.
Googled those answers before asking here.

What's going with kraken lately? Been having alot of troubles with them. Can't log, can't trade, can't withdraw, cant even get support.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:07:14

@_date: 2018-01-18 23:17:00
It's ok we won't need them real soon
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:52:46

@_date: 2018-01-03 08:52:11
Actually 2 weeks max then it'll be sent back to the sending address
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:36:14
Have you heard of altcoins?

@_date: 2018-01-24 01:25:01
Wtf's up with his eyes. Are they both stoned?
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:26:02

@_date: 2018-01-13 21:11:43
Nowhere it said that in the article
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:36:21
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:55:31
Yea, until we don't need fiat anymore. Good luck with that

@_date: 2019-07-17 14:57:00
Ahh I see thanks but that's a stupid idea. Whites have advanced the world 100 folds while the others have stayed in medieval era. Just look at Africa, how well everything goes there. I know it seems racist, but facts are facts.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:38:21
That shit is bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:41:56
Yea, he's an armchair expert, he knows his stuff

Cnbc being a noob again
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:39:15
Probably not. It's not in mine so what are the odds of him getting some?
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:21:06
Lol ok I knew that. I meant who are they?
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:44:51

As long as you keep it in coins, it's still and investment to their eyes. You are only taxed on interest gains once you cash out. Even if they don't send it to your bank account.

so all those people dont know how bitcoin works
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:57:42
Yea, although a but too risky for me. 15 years back when I had no expense I'm pretty sure I'd do the same
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:45:13
Damn those peaks must be nice, but how do you sleep on dips?

Bip 39 compliant, what ever that means, let's say in 5 years, protocols have been updated and the norm is now something else since Bip 39 is old-school, what happens then?
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:37:06
That's why I think bitcoin's infancy stage is scary to many of us, and people out there on the fence about buying in.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:32:27

@_date: 2017-12-03 17:23:12
And yet, some people still don't understand how unhealthy banks having all this power is, and will look at bitcoin as being some criminal currency. I can't wait for it to become mainstream

Banks won't ask questions. They're happy to see money coming in. Government will ask questions if you don't give them answers before hand.

If they don't, they believe with the media tells them

Backed by gold, petrol and diamond....
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:02:52
That's where I'm at too. Although I've been thinking of cashing a part of it to maybe put a cash down on some real-estate, but I'm afraid this move will make me lose alot in the futur. Also afraid I might lose in the future if I don't do it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:47:55
I was. Not sure his answer was relating to that or not
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:48:04
More like 90. Because the reward halves every 4 years
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:27:33
Trading what? Stocks?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:59:05
Where's the other 50, on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:51:12
Sure 9000%, but how do you chose which one to make such a profit?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:25
I've finally decided to cash some out today. Like 20% i had in btc. It's much more than what I invested at first, and sure is enough to pay for some renovations around the house. I feel like taking advantage now, in times of uncertainty is good for my mental health, plus, I still have 80 % left invested
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:16:15
What? No. An atm is the most anonymous. It doesn't ask you anything, plus it won't recognize you at McDonald's

Would you do it again today. If yes, on which coin?
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:40:56
Oh I know all about it. I'm a long time hodler, and I believe in it as welll. It's just that this problem seems like a big barrier to overcome and to have a truly secure crypto currency that works in the long run
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:31:25

@_date: 2017-12-16 14:38:47
Yea and if this goes mainstream. Imagine all the coins lost in the next 40 years
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:41:54
Exactly my thoughts
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:50:01
What wallet do you use to hodl your alts?
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:53:36
I love when it hits mainstream news and the crypto defender has legitimate answers

@_date: 2017-12-31 16:08:44
Ironic you say he doesn't know what he's talking about when you're completely out of bounds yourself. 
You pay taxes Only if those mines coins get sold back to fiat, then you pay taxes.

Good luck banning it
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:43:29
How about you send yourself an email with, for example, every 3rd or 4th word of the email is a word from your seed. Wouldn't this method be more easy /secure than having a poece of paper lying in a safe waiting to be burnt? And easier, much easier than having them punched in a metal bar?
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:53:40
or i could just leave the 23 first words at a couple different places and memorize the last one ? simple enough.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:08
and that's exactly when the IRS 'll come barging your door
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:46:37
Yea but isn't the real point of this technology to at some point, be able to simple use btc as THE currency? Without the need to "cash out"?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:32:56
What are tho exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:55:28

I can assure you one thing, kraken has a slow support, but from experience, they are not thieves, they've found my 3 year old account back from cavirtex, and with my btc balance in it. I had already lost all hope, but after a couple weeks of searching and back and forth emails, everything came into place. The last email they sent me saying I could now log in and retrieve my "lost" btc was a life changer for me. I wouldn't worry mate. Just hang on.

US government just passed a bill saying any holders of crypto currencies that aren't registered as one, would be a criminal
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:38:11
Worry maybe, but great things to look forward to.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:17:30
You don't
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:35:50
awesome thanks. Bitrated.com seems like a good answer to this problem for the short term, until a big player emerges and takes monopoly of the escrow / arbitrage service.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:55:17
I've done it last week with my So and my mother. To get them excited and talking to people around them
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:54:01
Why do they wear the same 2 size too big shirts since the 70's?
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:43:55
plus, it's a perfect invention for anonymity, but only if your trading with someone  you know, or for a service / goods in person like paying to a cashier in btc. So this so called "internet money" is hard to use securely on the internet. kinda paradoxical
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:33:13
What a shit hole that needs btc the most
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:24:31
I Bought at ATH of 700. Was that a bad idea too?

But the more gold you have, the more incapacitated you become. How can you make sure its all safe, how do you transport it without getting it stolen? How heavy will it get once you accumulate a fair share of it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:06:37
Plus, it's only 100$. Imagine the possible rampage if it was 100k
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:42:23
My first Bitcoin was bought cash for 700, at Mc Donald's. I got to sit down with this miner and asked alot of questions that time. I see the experience as a pretty cool milestone.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:06:24
Like you really needed to be reminded. Aren't you checking the price/ this sub 20 times a day like everyone?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:01:01
Last week someone posted something about 13 million addresses...?
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:00:13
And on the lower part is what?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:35:32
jsut imagine if 4 5 6 % of the world's population start using BTC. all those complaints are going to go parabolic on those companies... better start hiring now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:37:15
And has an awesome support / service team. I had some mix-ups in my orders and they fixed it promptly and effectively.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:50:31
Plus not investing in the currency itself
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:39:41
What am I looking at here?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:43:49
I've Recieved my nano S. And let me tell you, it's very simple. Just go to the website written on the cue cards that come with it. Everything is instructed very clearly with videos. You can't really make a mistake putting them on your cold wallet. Have fun
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:45:57
So an intangible crypto currency backed by the most archaic goods. Sounds about what Venezuela would do.

That's how mcaffee calculated his bet
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:41:45
On what basis?
@_date: 2018-08-19 12:59:03
Generally, as in, this happens often?

Why 213k exactly?
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:40:15
It isn't more efficient, it just takes longer to heat the whole tank
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:08:09
Probably early miners who had a shit ton and are able to trade with a lot of liquidity.

I don't trust Colbert either
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:05:51
I got the crypto steel ad well with it. Couldn't get passed the fact that a fortune was being held by a piece of paper
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:41:00
That why it's still ways ahead of mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-07 05:36:53

This is going to be funny to watch unravel on the next decade. While btc swooshes by like a rocket

@_date: 2019-11-04 20:40:54
So, but my high sell low Donald?
@_date: 2019-11-20 17:18:21
Because they actually *can* buy btc, seems like they missed the real estate boat
@_date: 2018-10-03 01:01:30
Because price is lowering. And no volume to show
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:44:01
Coincards.ca worked great for me
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:12:47
Gg noob for leaving it on exchange though
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:07:30
Trying to hold, and forget how everything works
@_date: 2018-10-03 00:34:30
Makes sense, investors coming in, meanwhile, the price keeps tanking. What?
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:55:27
The fuck language is he speaking?
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:04:46
I bought at a peak a couple years back at 700. When it went down to around 230, I didn't care cause I knew I'd hold for at least 5 years.
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:59:31

Don't you know by now, they're like vegans,. They NEED to tell people.

That's why u use crypto steel in tandem ;)
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:57:21
It started out as 30% as I was in an appartement no kids. Prices went up and bought two houses since. With the price increase I'd be at around 30% still.

"institutions". Which one though? We've been hearing about them for a while now. Who are they?
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:48:53
Yea and everybody here knows that a parabolic trend isn't sustainable. Apparently governments don't.

@_date: 2019-10-05 13:27:37
1,000,000 by the end of 2020. The halvening would've happened by then
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:28:30
It's all clear, but don't forget that those reasons are going to skyrocket btc and fuck up the whole world's economy. I'm not sure I'm eager to see any of this. It's going to be a bloodbath
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:53:13
Gah. I hadn't watched for a while, it's bad back in xrp land
@_date: 2019-10-10 10:55:54
So? The rest of my portfolio didn't even do 4% last year
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:51:15
I wonder if Satoshi envisioned that mining would get this extreme. I mean yea the idea to being able to mine from a laptop was awesome but now rendered useless if you're not an industry
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:27:43
That's the real reason why we're going to hit 100k

Let's talk about that sentence in 5 years.
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:12:03
but hand over to whom ?! I mean i hear that he's not Satoshi, but why does he have to pay back what he doesnt even have ?
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:26:28
Well yes. It came right on the 2017/2018 crash so people are pointing fingers to CNY
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:39:02
Yes, and use coincards.com

I understand completely, I was pretty tech savy 10 years ago, now im 37 and have my business and have no time to research this enough to my taste. Once it arrives by mail, ill make sure and read all i  can about it before anything. There is plenty of videos, books, and forums out there to help you im sure. Good luck man, and keep hodling
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:00:15
I remember the first time  I saw a television ad where they wrote their website address, it was Volkswagen and I was impressed of how in tune they were with this new technology back then. Now a business that doesn't have a website is retarded. I'm pretty sure we'll look at this one the same way in 20 years as I do with Volkswagen
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:57:29
talking like a true conspiracy theorist. Listen , I'm in this boat as much and as hardcore as you probably. But give me one example where there never was inflation and it's been profitable for everyone.

Why am I fearing every exchange has that, scammy / unreliable potential.
I can't wait for btc to get to 1,000,000. But I'm also afraid to having trouble withdrawing when needed
@_date: 2019-02-28 11:54:36
I had the same year. But firetruck red. What a car.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:58:45

@_date: 2019-06-17 07:05:58
Why can't he use it as a tax shield?
@_date: 2019-06-07 10:57:01
That's so good
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:01:41
Only 14k?. What a pessimist
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:10:56
A crash these days is a 2% dip
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:24:06
How disgusting is this guy?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:44
I wanted to cash out to pay the house too but the interest we're making right now off shoots any kind of debt interest by alot. I'm waiting for everything to calm down, either volatility lowers, or price stagnates. Then I'm paying off my house. Until then, all I say to myself to keep hodling, is that at first, the money invested was money I was ready to lose. Everything else is gravy now. Still good job man, and I'm adding this post to favs as a "how to bitcoin" post.
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:11:26
exactly. lets 5% of us are willing to sell to those millionaires. It makes btc ten times more valuable .

@_date: 2017-11-28 00:07:06
You need to stop thinking that way, because there's always going to be a "man, I wish I woulda" moment. Imagine at 30 $ or 1 $. It never ends. Just enjoy being part of it and stay positive, looking at a bright near future.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:43:12
Exactly. I've lost interest in trying to prove people how theyre probably missing a great opportunity.

Plus China has 70 % of them

With what logic?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:29:51
700 ath here, it dropped to 130 the next months. Never bought more

I'm actually pretty fucking ashamed. It was money I was prepared to lose back then. And I'm trying now to figure how I lost those. It was pretty clear for me back then how everything worked, but 4 years later I need to relearn everything and trying to figure this out as well.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:59:54

@_date: 2017-10-22 20:07:38
Man i really wish i'd remember how i did this, like I said its been over 4 years, and havent looked into BTC since just now. So I kinda have to relearn the works you know. One thing I know though, is that I was using Cavirtex to day trade, and once I decided I was done and wanted to hold for another 10 years, I must've transfered all I had back to a digital wallet like Bitcoin Wallet if I recall. Now how I transfered all that to paper , I really cant remember, but I Have a couple files with *Back up codes* and *private key* noted that I cant recall how or where to use either.  (not that I haven't searched). Ive tried redownloading Bitcoin wallet, but everything has changed since then and I can't even seem to be able to login with my older username. I feel like this whole thing went over my head so quick, I've kinda abandonned the idea I'd ever get anything back. BUt today i decided I'd go over my ego and ask you guys. thx for your time. I'd be more than willing to offer a generous tip to anyone who can guide me getting those back.

@_date: 2018-07-21 16:24:07
I had my own electric company as well in Canada. And had "we accept bitcoin". Stamped on it. It brought 100 questions about it for 0 actual payment. But at least I got to spread the word

Buy the dip till it hits the bottom
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:00:29
Another question while we're at it. I had a backup of a 15 alphanumeric backup key.
And 10 strings of  8 numbers which I've noted as "backup codes". Does that ring any bell for you? 
I was using cavirtex back then. They changed to kraken.com since and they weren't of any help. Been emailing back and forth for weeks now.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:52:14
That's what it was, I couldn't put the finger on it
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:16:08
Exactly. I'm far from rich and Im ashamed this happened. Back then the money I put into btc was surplus, risky, and ready to lose if all else fails. But since then, I've lost appetite over btc's price explosion.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:32:06
Still don't get the correlation

What did he say?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:02:08
See, even this kind of answer leaves me in a  clouded area. How, where, when do I even do those things?
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:40:15
I love the nonchalant vibe from his chewing
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:28:17

This kind of answer is why normal people don't get into bitcoin. It's way too fucking complicated. I bought 3.5 btc a couple years back. Made my research, learned a ton, hodled and moved on. But now, I don't even remember the basics to how to retrieve or get back my investments.

If it's so easy to steal bitcoin from people, what aren't they working on something to make sure that when it gets mainstream and mass adoption, we still aren't a target?

I spent mine on  Coincards.ca

I bought from Coincards.ca. Twice. Really easy and fast.
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:36:48
I'm not using it because reading your post was like reading Chinese to me. I'll just wait until everything smoothes out for regular people to use adequately
