And tried to buy a couple murders. But I'm sure on balance he's a swell guy.

1998 called and it wants you to stop using its lame comebacks.

So many questions:
1) He pulled 6600 in cash out of an ATM? What bank permits that kind of withdrawal remotely? My "this super duper didn't happen" sense is twitching.
2) Why are you shuffling cash between multiple banks?
3) Could this not have been solved by him giving you a cashiers check? 
Seems the only thing making this inefficient was you.

It's just a little confusing, that's all. There's a tendency around these parts to make things up to "prove" the utility of Bitcoin, but I can definitely see someone's insistence on using cash as mucking up a relatively simple transaction.

That's not true, at least not the industrial revolution part. We have jolly old England to thank for that. The US was busy revolution-ing at that point.

Fight fire with fire? *Really?* of all the things posted about you guys on buttcoin, you get your feathers ruffled over the suggestion to go outside? 
In any event, sorry that I hurt your feefees. I had no idea you were such a delicate flower - I'll keep that in mind in the future.

That can happen, and it is a pain.

Yes, paying taxes is like slavery. No distinguishing characteristics whatsoever.

You're not completely without options - you could pay your taxes and avoid the predicament entirely.

I never equated legality with being "ok," I was drawing a distinction between abuse and taxation. If you're actually interested, here's one (of many) arguments that can be made about taxation not being immoral: 
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:17:54
Oy vey. The federal reserve is not a private bank and administrative law is perfectly constitutional, has been upheld consistently by SCOTUS and is perfectly enforceable. Taxes are not voluntary by any stretch of the imagination - nor should they be. You're not going to wow me with your "learned it on a YouTube video, must be true" nonsense. I'm an attorney, hardly ignorant. Try again - it's fun for me.

Of course I'm concerned when moral abominations are legal. Taxation is not a moral abomination.

Person with the most ethical integrity in Bitcoin is a human trafficker - good to know.

Don't cut yourself on all that edge, dear.

Taxes are not in any way akin to abuse nor are they illegal. So, no. I wouldn't "advice" that. But that would you compare yourself to an abused spouse for having to pay taxes shows your total lack of empathy or perspective. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:52:43
Oh golly, you're one of those. 
*backs away slowly*

lol bless your heart.
