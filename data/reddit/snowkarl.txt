What a massively misinformed comment. If you really want an airline example to the effects of (de)regulation, look at the ACTUAL effects of the Airline deregulation act of 1978: 
By 1996, airline fares had dropped by THIRTY PERCENT, pollution had been reduced by increasing efficiency and filling a higher percentage of plane seats and the airline industry saw its biggest ever boom. Wow, what a horrible outcome! 
If you think that a lack of government intervention caused the current depression I honestly don't know what to tell you, you don't think it had anything to do with the MASSIVE government interference in the bankings and manufacturing businesses that really did cause the chain reaction that led up to the 08 crash then you're simply not being objective.
And you don't know the meaning of anarchy. Libertarians want COURTS OF LAW which is the opposite of anarchy.

I'm not into bitcoins and I don't really care about it but I can't stand these "liberals" or whatever who come into this sub and mock people because they want deregulated economies. 
Just because they don't want regulations doesn't mean they want anarchy and abolish courts of law. Libertarians aren't anarchists and you're showing a fundamental lack of education and knowledge by posting childish shit like that.

Every economic system has ups and down, communism and capitalism both. There will always be good and bad times, there is no such thing as perfect economies. There is only balancing and trade offs.

it absolutely is a loss, especially since bitcoin is a currency and its worth against actual products and services is 1/3 of what it was.
