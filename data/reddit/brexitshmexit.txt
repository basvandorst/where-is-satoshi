Yes this kind of information is very limited. With the twitter account one can speculate that if it wasn't taken over by govt at least someone else is posting there now because the posts just sound different. There's none of this information in the blockchain notes. This taken into account, the vanity addresses say absolutely nothing.

Similar spirit to former startup valuations scheme - value based on eyeballs, not actual paying customers. Which made the bubble.
