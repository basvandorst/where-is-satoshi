It wasn’t years back but was recent. I hadn’t realized they finally sold them though so good to know

Can we just downvote this post out of existence it’s 100% wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:09:08
Honestly its not serious unless it’s over a few thousand. I mean back when bitcoin was $100 each I would of said $1,000 was in pretty deep. Now, with the very fast growth I don’t think $100 is anything 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:35:04
They paid over $100 just for the transfer fees...wtf
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:08:03
This is just ridiculous. This isn’t a correction or a dip. The price is up significantly in every regard except for what 48 hours? This is not a dip at all. The correction has yet to come. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:56:49
A person who has that kind of money didn’t go all in. It shows how much movement can be from just a few people.

No one really knows, thats an honest answer. Logically it would make sense that the price of bitcoin goes down a whole lot from its current price. First off this isn't abnormal for bitcoin to do this. Look at its early days and it was the rush to $100 then $1,000 then this time to around $18,000. Every single time there is an absurd influx of money and the price soars very quickly followed by a short lull then a dip then a correction. The correction is where price falls higher than where it was say 6 months ago but lower than all the recent highs. Then the price sits or is stable at that price for a while. Look at 2013 rush to 1,000 then it was steady at around 250 for over a year. 
The price jumps are now massive but really the "%" of jumps is getting smaller. Bitcoin isn't really even seeing as big of jumps as other coins in the terms of %. Look at etherium or litecoin theyve seen like 4000-5000 gains this year where as bitcoin is around 1800%. 
My 2 cents.

If anyone were actually following that advice they wouldn’t be here on reddit watching it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:33:49
This fucker is full of shit. Very few held from 3 years ago much less 6. If you do you’d be a billionaire and not ducking around on reddit
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:42:14
That entire thing on both sides was just a huge joke...
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:33:32
Did the same but used dogecoin, got the saw, sander, a crib with mattresses, recliner chair and swing for the baby! Love that crypto
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:36:43
You’re assuming they ever “buy in” it’s a baby currency that has limited use at the moment. It has a long way to grow and it’s still nothing more than hysteria at the moment. Bitcoin has no inherent value, like anything, it’s only worth what people view it is as. Elderly can live their days just the same without bitcoin. 
Not only that but the number of people going “all in” is growing. Many of those that did it months ago or even last month will be fine. I promise you though bitcoin will claim many many losers and their will be a rough and dark period coming. Too many people believe bitcoin can only go up. You hear bitcoin being worth 100,000 a coin. While the coin has had massive % gains before it can only go so high. There are so many people buying the coin with the sole purpose of selling it later to make a profit. 
I know that there will be plenty of dip shits who will GAMBLE their entire life on bitcoin and lose. People will commit suicide over the losses. Bitcoin is no different than any other run in history it’s just new. All it’s going to take is a good panic and enough people to lose money to lose its popularity.

So i to follow bitcoin, more so with its recent insane and unheard of price jumps. 
The total volume according to the link is about 150k in 24 hours or almost 1.5 BILLION US dollars. 
Is that right? You’re telling me that people across the world have exchanged 1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in 1 day? 
Or is this also bitcoin for bch or any other coin exchanges as well?
It feels hard to pull bitcoin into fiat so 1.5 B just seems too much but I was hoping someone could help me understand better. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:52:31
Sorry must be out of the loop what is that, the 265 I mean. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:56:53
Idk, i feel like you’re hoping for a news article or something. It’s over half a million dollars worth. For that much money why would you not be out there contacting some really smart individuals who could help you? No one would be this chill about having $600,000 resource but being blocked from it from a lost password 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:02:23
Right but it still needs value
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:24:44
That seems like a massive risk. They’ve reported millions in trades already. How do think a 25% increase in price in a year is unachievable when it’s up 1000% year to date? That could cost them millions.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:26:11
You can trade securities and billions could be traded with no one actually holding the coin itself. It’s just gambling 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:15:09
That’s a crazy risk. If you think bitcoin is gonna skyrocket higher than 10k wouldn’t you just buy bitcoin now at 8k and keep all the profits???
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:03:54
I wasn’t saying go full fiat I was saying don’t go all in
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:06:02
Which currently it is exactly that, just speculative. The price was steady at $250 for a long time showing a base line. This crazy jump has people assuming it’ll go to 17k 100k etc when it’s more likely to crash down to 1k
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:20:57
I’ve read a large number, whether true or just driving hype. Of people taking out loans, maxing cards and cashing out their homes and 401ks for bitcoin. 
It’s great to get in but treat it like you should all investments and stay diversified. If it goes up you’re gonna hate me but if it crashes you’ll be glad you listened. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:29:26
What I mean is that any currency, because technically that’s what bitcoin is. Has the ability to fail. If bitcoin were to fail it could be completely forgotten and it’s only those who invested who lose. It’s possible. A government backed crypto would not be allowed to fail without the government also failing. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:25:05
It’s not surprising at all. In fact as long as people keep doing that the price will keep going up. The price point is great. Securities on bitcoin are great. Unless bitcoin itself is being used and people start using it every single day it won’t last. It’s still in FAD stage right now. It’s booming so fast and people are putting a shit ton of money into it. That has to stop at some point. Someone has to lose money. It’ll happen just wait for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:59:32
No, a government backed system would win over a non government backed one because people know that the government will bail out its own systems. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:01:30
They didn't use bitcoin tho. They converted their bitcoin to cash and then paid... that kind of defeats the purpose right?
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:40:53
Oh I see I misunderstood then. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:53:25
I don't believe for a second that he really feels that way and that big banks aren't involved in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:41:57
I don’t really understand how bitcoin is any different. Want to buy it easily? There’s a fee. Want to transfer bitcoin? Fee! Want to sell bitcoin? Fee!
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:46:13
No one has any idea what it’s going to do. All this conjecture for nothing  
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:47:00
Well since price is now at 526 I'm guessing the short term didn't work out so well for them. People are probably gonna dump for a while. I personally just trade the currency so the downward trend doesn't hurt so much but hope it goes back up. China China China 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:55:11
Not bad! Isn't the value like $3 though? No insult intended but that seems aweful low. Nice homemade setup though
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:37:11
Brilliant idea! Probably gonna make a killing on it
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:48:05
You can't get a refund, if you purchased and now lost money I would just hold and hope it goes back up. They did this on their own for whatever security reasons. Coin base is about as legit as it gets
