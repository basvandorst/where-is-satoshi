UPDATED 12/30:
New York Times is investigating Cointal. They have not been able to get in touch with anyone there by phone. They received an email from "Yousef" who is claiming to be the CIO. But he likewise did not address any of the proof shown here regarding the editing of the chat, so he is likely the hacker posing as the CIO. 
Forbes write Harold Stark has reviewed the evidence presented and expressed his concerns with cointal: 
Other users are reporting issues as well:

There is clearly something going on. We ask the reddit community to help to get to the bottom of this. Remember, the hack appears to be internal or at least have access to internal systems such as email. So the best thing is to try to get in touch with the people actually running Cointal directly through social media, phone etc if someone knows them. Any message coming from a Cointal social media account (FB, Reddit, Twitter) is linked to their compromised email system and therefore cannot be relied upon. 
We also ask that anyone who has reviewed the evidence and can clearly see what is going on to spread the word, on Twitter, FB and other social media sites. We need to get the attention of a real Cointal employee who can do something about this hack.

Just letting you all know about Cointal getting hacked. Full details here:   Be safe, don't trade on it, spread the word!

I don't think transaction fees are the issue. Lax security at exchanges such as Cointal which let this happen as well as the constant need of crooks and criminals to attempt to get "free money" is the main driver.

The deposit went through, there was no issue with that. Everyone can see from the transaction ID it was deposited to Cointal, and in the screenshots it was credited to our account at Cointal. I'm not sure why you keep bringing it up.  
Again, you are failing completely to respond to the very obvious proof we have shown that the Cointal chat from that user/seller/hacker SamB showed an XRP address (to which the XRP was sent correctly) that was then later CHANGED in the chat by him to make it look like the payment was sent to the wrong address. The proof is in the automatically generated email that Cointal itself sent. 
We do not think Cointal was a scam/phishing website from the beginning. It has multiple employees and it appears one that has access to the system is now using it for fraud. Obviously the actual CEO and other people running Cointal that are not involved in this hack will soon be made aware of this issue and I would assume they would try to resolve it (and if they don't then that does mean that the entire Cointal was complicit in this scheme). 
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:23:57
You have now confirmed that this is an inside job and the Cointal team is complicit (or the hacker has access to their email and therefore their social media accounts such as this reddit user). To answer your points specifically
1) In regards to DEPOSIT, there was a delay in crediting the deposit to our account that is correct. It did eventually credit. We have uploaded the screenshot already showing the deposit ("cointalxrp" where the deposit appears at 18:45), and here is the actual transaction ID for it (when it was sent to Cointal): 890B73B8FD9E71C64609058B1F34C9600A8ED64736EDE18077D18158F9EC2CDD
2) In regards to withdrawal, we have clear documentation that shows that the address provided by the user WAS the one the transaction was sent to. We have already had multiple people verify this independently. And now just as you responded, we have confirmation that Cointal Staff released the escrow! You can see the screenshot labeled "cointal staff cancelled trade" at the dropbox link provided. In fact, the Cointal "team" did NOT respond at ALL to us when we sent them the proof, only to the first email when we informed "them" of the issue. Stating that "everything was plannified from your side" makes no sense. We are a well known crypto trader, we've been featured in the press and have done regular trading on LocalBitcoins with no problems. We have no reason to attempt to scam anyone. More importantly, we do not even have an account at Poloniex exchange (where the XRP address that the user SamB told us to send to). Also stating "your device has been compromised" makes no sense. Again we are doing many transactions daily with no issues, and we specifically sent the XRP to the EXACT address the user SamB directed us to, and we have a copy of that in our email which has been shown in the screenshot. 
3) Of course when we believed that the user SamB was acting externally (without knowing he was a Cointal employee or had access to your email), we did write in the chat that he should release the escrow because we completed payment as requested to the specific address requested. You can see that screenshot uploaded as well "cointalchat". That is of course normal as a seller should release escrow when buyer makes payment as instructed. There is no issue here. We have already proven that the seller DID specify the address to which we sent the XRP and then changed it in the chat log. 
4) The UK number on your website now just does not dial at all. This is very easy for other users to check as they can just call it and see for themselves. 
This is very serious and I hope the reddit community can see and share this, especially because this is now confirmed to be a compromise of Cointal's emails as well. In the meantime, we are already working with FBI Cyber Division and United Kingdom Action Fraud Police Division.

Also Porsche made air cooled tractors...but if we are going back that far ABT (the Audi tuner/Audi race team) started building and modifying Horse Carriages.

Thank you for leaving any comment as all are welcome and appreciated. As this is an open forum for questions I think every person in the industry I will be interviewing will have both positive and negative comments. 
Starting with a polarizing figure I expected this to be a great topic for discussion. 
Please let me know if you have any suggestions for future “Experts” and I will reach out to them as well. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:07:10
You just signed up for reddit and this is your first post to scam people who have already been scammed. I’ll send it to you via Cointal, please provide your user name. LOL

Thanks for clearing that up.

Good job u/LucidDrDreams. Crypto will be for everyone, not just serious investors, in the near future.
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:13:38
I completely agree. Social media platforms like YouTube already have too much control over our content as well. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:12:42
I agree that **was** very clever

Very clever

Actually most of the people from your list we have reached out to plus many more. We have to respect their schedules and their PR teams schedules. If there is requests for a specific person I can take that to their team to show the interest from the audience.

This is why, he explains in his [previous article]( that Crypto-Keynesians want larger blocks.

It makes sense because I had quite a few requests for vehicles in Victoria and Sidney. I’ve sold a couple of cars for crypto in Austrailia but not an Audi R8 though.
