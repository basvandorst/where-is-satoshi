Well, don't lose it either, like putting it behind a bad password you forget or whatever!
I almost lost 90 BTC yesterday because Blockchain.info just made one of my wallets disappear and I happened to notice. If I hadn't figured out to restore a backup (they automatically email you encrypted backups of you're wallets *if you use that feature*), that money would have been *gone*. I filed a ticket with them but if they can seemingly misplace a 90BTC wallet, I can spend a little.
I'd still recommend their wallet though, but I'd really like to know what happened there.
This stuff is still super new and risky. FTFY

Did you try checking you're balance from an international number?  If so, did you get an error back in response?  I've been trying to check my balance, to no avail... FTFY

thanks for you're reply. Could you back up you're  claim? :) Interested to know why. FTFY

I pity the fool who gives up on buying a GPU mining rig because of this video. Let's check back in one month why you have not yet received you're BFL product and how much my GPU:s have made. FTFY

And if you draw we still send back you're bet ;)

You're thinking about amounts of drugs/money that someone who matters might actually care about, nobody is going to go through all that work for an oz of weed.  
SR is mostly small transactions that easily hide in the some-odd billion packages processed by the USPS every year.
Even if you're package is somehow intercepted, it's not trivial for authorities to prove you actually ordered it, even if you're name is on the box. FTFY

Note that on mpex/icbit and similiar sites you'ree betting against bot in a closed system.
[url= a bucket shop[/url] - you're profits are limited by what is the counterparty willing to pay, instead of potentially unlimited profits extracted from real market.
At least bitcoinica was kind enough to actually pass through to mtgox when local collateral was not enough... FTFY
