Yeah mining ETH with GPUs.
Idk man, I feel like if bitmain is gonna take a lot of time to ship, then that is a potential loss in income. Maybe it's just better to get some ready to ship s9 from a reputable seller.

Dude 2-3months ago 99% of people I net did not know about it. Now? Every single person I ever meet mentions it. It's like 50 times more popular than game of thrones at this point. It made it to the first page of wall street journal several times. It's all ppl talk about in financial news. Now every single ceo mentions it in his speech including mark from facebook. You can't get much more popular than this trust me.

Thing is, if btc fails and its price drops, every single other crypto will collapse. Other cryptos are even less trustworthg than btc so if btc failed no investor in his right mind will invest in a less trustworthy alt coin. Your best bet is bitcoins.
I see it like this at this point. Btc will either hit 80k-100k by end of next year or it will go to 0. So if you invest 1k now it will either be 8k or maybe 10k or it will be 0. So how much are you willing to gamble with is the real question.

I would argue that other coins are already better but it's irrelevant. I will give u a few examples. are familiar with whatsapp? It's basically a messaging app with a billion downloads. Guess what. When it first started it was shit and you could find a TON of better apps like it. It lacked encryption or voice call ect... Yet it remained number one because of its popularity. Little by little, month after month they were able to slowly upgrade. And now they have everything that is needed. 2years ago they were still messaging app number 1 even though they were shit.
Take Facebook. Same story. A lot of better platforms existed or were created at the start. Yet fb remained number 1 because of the network effect. Popularity is all what matters for a network dominant technology. If u have the user base EVERYTHING will follow.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:19:53
Any "better" coin is open source. If it were that great all we have to do is copy paste what's gd about it and implment it here. Anyway, I believe that btc will stay on top for T least 2-3morw years. We'll see.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:14:41
Hahaha. Didn't mean to be mean. About what you said, the tech itself is worth nothing. It's open source code free for everyone to copy paste. The value of bitcoin is its network effect and popularity. The more people use it and trust it the more valuable it is. The problem here is that theoretically it could go to 0 or to 300k no one can tell. If you have a company that does say tables, you can tell that it has assets worth something. Worse case scenario you sell the factory and this is its price. For btc it's diff the value is virtual.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:53:41

Incorrect. It's offer and demand. One might be ready to pay 15200 for 1 btc even though it was 14900 1 second ago. It's how the market works. It doesn't have to pass by 15000 at all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:23:55

This. Massive arbitrage opportunities in bitcoin since day one. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:49
High fees and slow network but it will soon change. Segwit and lightning network will increase transaction speeds and devs will keep working to optimize the coin.
Bitcoin can easily change to always remain the best alternative. The code itself is open source. There is no value in this code whatsoever. The only value any crypto has is its network value. The more people know about it, the more it is worth. Any other coin will also have an open source code. Bitcoin could simply copy paste it if it was truly superior. This is why the real value is the how popular a coin is.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:54:51
Limit? Where?
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:38:26
I don't think so. The difficulty sets how much time and money you need to mine Bitcoins. As more miners come in, the difficulty will go up or down. At the end, if it was so profitable more miners would come in making it not so profitable since difficulty will increase. Now if it is not profitablr, difficulty will go down making it profitable again. Basic economy, it will always remain at an okish profit margin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:22:39
Btc is not becoming a currency any time soon. People won't spend it while knowing it might double tomorrow. For the time being it's simply here and people trust it. When it becomes more popular the price will stabilize. Hopefully next year fees and time will be fixed. If it were to ever become a global currency it would need 5 to 10years at least. If it is successful, you can expect its price to be at least 500 000+. ATM in 10 years, bitcoin will be either 500 000 or 0 nothing in between. If it lasted it will be huge

@_date: 2017-12-07 09:39:30
Can I ask you a question? What's the difference between btc and and 1000 other crypto who are worth next to nothing. Btc is open source, a lot of these alt coins have the samw code or even improved it. So why is this coin that can be recreated by copy pasting its code anytime worth 300 000 in your smart opinion?

Good. So you are saying it's not the technology, but the name itself that is worth 14500 at the moment right? I agree with you here. But your only bet here is that people will keep trusting btc because the only thing it has going for it is the name. As for a currency the chances of that happening are 0.0000001%. Governments will ban it way before it has a tiny chance.

@_date: 2017-12-07 08:36:35
Not gonna happen. Too volatile to be a currency. Transaction fees are like 10 bucks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:47:40
But if I copy the code now, I can create a coin named my-coin ans it will.also have 21million cap. Why is it gold standard? A ton of new crypto have a better code, better transaction fees, faster and are superior to btc in every single aspect. If gold standard is referring to btc then a ton of other cryptos are diamond, yet they are worth very little. Don't you find it a bit weird? I first believed btc was going to be a global currency, but now I see that this is imporssible. Too volatile, extremely high transaction fees and time ect... No one wants to spend btc if it will double in value next month. Such a currecy cannot exist.
So take a deep breath and think about it. Why isn't litecoin, a legit coin that is superior to btc in every single aspect for example not the same price as btc? What makes it special? The code? It's open source, the code is worth 0. The tech? 1500 clones half of which are superior are out there trading for a few cents. The price is fishy. The last 2months made me lose faith in bitcoin. It increased too high way too fast.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:37:33

@_date: 2017-12-22 23:17:15
In 2120 or something. Let ur kids tell u then. What stops them is not having btc's fame. At the end only 1 cryto will become the global currency. And btc is far ahead so far.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:58:12
300 000 accounts mean nothing if people are using them to buy 100 bucks of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:51:24
The main advantage is that you cam short bitcoins. In other words, you bet that bitcoins will decrease in value and you make profits out of it. One od the theories is that big investors are pumping the price now so as soon as futures come out, they can short it and make a ton of profit from the price drop.
Some say btc price might become less volatile. Could be a gd thing but could also crush btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:41
Hahah same here. Wtf is going on?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:20
Idk what to think anymore. The past 2months have ruined my faith in btc. Price increase so much, it's pure euphoria and bubble right now. Idk about selling. Futures can go either way but they have the potential to maasively drop btc. If price drops fast,everyone will.keep selling ans btc could go to 0.
If you think about it, btc has no value. The value it has comes from the market confidence and trust. The code is open source. The tech itself has 0 value, not even a penny. I can xopy paste btc code right now and name it bitbitc coin and it will be exactly like btc. In fact, there are 1300 currencies half of which have even better tech than btc yet they are trading for pennies right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:58:07

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:46
2 is just silly. 1 is not important.
I will talk about 3 since it is the smartest argument. Fees are high ATM and currency is highly volatile. It cannot be used as a currency right now. If it could, you wouldn't even see dollars anymore.
Several options are going to be implemented next year in order to drastically increase the speed and make it easier to trade with low fees. Secondly, the volatility will decrease as more and more people buy it and trust it. It will take a few years. But once it is stable it will slowly dominate the world. We are still at its infancy.

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:41
I don't get your train of thoughts bro. When you short, you make profit if bitcoin price drops. What you are saying is that if they buy a lot of btc and short futures at the same time then they can sell everything, drop the price and thus make money from their futures correct? The problem here is that they will lose money from tbe btc value decrease while selling. 
Ideally, futures are used as a way to hedge for an asset you already have. In other words if you own X, and short a future of X is X decreases in value the future short will pay off. So you neither win nor lose in both situations (whether X increases or decreases). Now you could argue that dumping all their btc will cause mass panick and cause btc to plummet to zero thus making a ton of profit from the shorts. However, if the panic does not occur they won't make much profit since the price decreases will affect them too (they bought the btc at a higher price).

This is the largest risk bitcoin is running. The longer they wait though, the harder it might become to ban it. What you said is very true, no government in its right mind will let that happen. They lose any power to monitor taxes, money laundering and criminal activities. It destroys the very basic concept of a government. 
Now we have countries like japan who are adopting wide adoption so that is a positive.
Don't listen to the "cannot be stopped" hyper. Sure you can hide your keys ect.. But that's not the ppint. Bitcoin is a currency, no one will trade an illegal cirrency it's stupod and pointless.
Yes you can torrent a movie to have fun and watch it or do some illegal drugs  but that is just fun. You do not have any intrinsic value in bitcoins. It is just a currency and once it is no longer accepted its value will drop to 0.
You can hide it sure, you can trade it illegally , sure but it will have a value of 0 usd because it will no longer have any practical use.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:07:45
The very fact that you are saying that bitcoin's remaining value comes from facilitating criminals to make their deals proves that no decent person will trade bitcoin. If it is only traded between criminals it will not have any value for the normal decent user who will avoid it like the plague. It will be equivelent to blood money.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:30:33
U can risk paying fines while watching stranger things but at least you are having fun.
The whole point of bitcoin is for it to become a legal currency. If it becomes illegal then it has no use a currency. Why would you risk anything for virtual numbers on a screen that are recognized as illegal by all merchants.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:38:05
You can torrent stuff and you can surely still.illegally trade bitcoin however unlile torrenting movies there is no fun in owning bitcoin. It is just a number on a screen. It takes value from the fact that it is a potential currency. Once it becomes illegal no merchant will accept it thus destroying the main function it was always meant to have. You can still trade it sure, but enjoy selling and buying a 10cents bitcoin that has no use whatsoever.

No you missed the point. Crypto and blockchain is the internet, bitcoin is one of 1000 other cryptocurrency some of which are technologically superior and trade for a small fraction of bitcoin current price. Btc might prevail or it might go bust and get replaced by other currencies. Only time will tell. But for now bitcoin is 900% in a bubble because it fitd every single aspect of a bubble. In fact, it would constitute a textbook example of what a bubble is.

I agree. Sometimes governments are evil. That was not the point. All I am saying is that if the US judge that bitcoin is a major facilitator for criminals and for tax evasion then they might ban it/ put a ton of regulations. And if they do, the price will tank to next to 0 because an illegal currency is risky and has next to no value. That being said, I think time is on our side. The longer they wait, the harder it will be to actually ban it.

I completely agree with your statement. I don't know the small details. I have read enough about bitcoins to know the fundamentals of every  fork so far, how the blockchain works ect.. I didn't dive into the small details. From what I know it used to be a maximum size of 1mb per block. I also read that segwit was basically equivilent to a capacity of 2mb per block. Now the segwit2x being equivilent to 8mb is what confused me here. But sacrificing 100gb per month on bandwidth is not a deal breaker with all the unlimited internet plans we find nowadays.
I would really like if you could link me to an a nice article talking about segwit's relation to maximum.block size or perhaps you could explain it im your own terms.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:29:51


I don't know. Segwit2x is decent honestly. Sooner or later a size increase would be necassary. The problem is them kicking the core devs out.

Last fork was messy too. I expected prices to plummet... Guess I was wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:55:07
By B I kind of meant that when you are running a certain node is there no way for you to force it to verify a certain transaction? You do not have to alter it to change its ID but maybe bypass or change the node's setting as to what constutes a legit block and what doesn't.
I'm not sure if you totally understand what I'm saying. In short how can you be sure that every single node in the system is actually working 100% correctly and according to the rules. Are there no possible way to make a node look normal to the rest of the system while it is actually accepting fake transactions?
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:15:55
Before last fork I decided not to put anything because I thought the price would drop significantly. I thought that having 2 coins out of bitcoins would cause trust to drop and prices to plummet. Too bad the price almost doubled right after lol. So now I'm kinda confused it seems that common logic does not apply to such a volitile market...
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:07:05
Hahha. Ok one more question for you: when quantum computers become available will that eventuality remain impossible? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:55:51
Is the difficulty constant or does it progressively change. I read somewhere that it automatically changes so the speed remains at 10 mins per block. Is that accurate?
Also is the block directly related to the number of transactions done? I hear a lot that you could mine a block that is almost empty ect. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:09:44
Thank you. That was great.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:05:14
So if the node checks why can't it create the block too. How does the POW help? For instance if one node displays a fraudulent block all the other nodes will point it out and it will be void. So why do we need the miners or the POW in the first place?
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:20:48
It's not really up to us. There is nothing you can do about it. It's come once again to the big investors. Decentralization has failed in my opinion. The miners have too much power nowadays. 
You can't really blame the exchanges. I think that in principle, after a fork the longest chain keeps the original name. The exchanges have altered it to a better version of "who has more hashing power" to remidy to the fact that new mined blocks could be easier in the new chain. Can you really blame them? They are following the basic rule to determine what chain is named what.
I can't really see how much we can do. If the investors and the guys with the big bucks want to screw us they can. This is a real problem for bitcoin. As long as it's not addressed bitcoin could end any time wall street or the rich dude make a consensus that this coin should end. Add to that the fact that governements might end up making it illegal and you face real problems.
The road to the moon will certainly be bumpy and could end abruptly. But one has to try nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:20:33
Or permanently crush the hopes of bitcoin.ever becoming a currency, especially if the us bans it bitcoin would be pretty much over as the rest of the world will surely follow
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:24:04
Are you sure about the "no neat answer" part? For example during last fork we knew right away that the segwit bitcoin would maintain the original name before seeing which chain was more popular. Same goes got the upcoming bitcoin gold. 
So if the segwit2x coin gains the biggest popularity will it be named bitcoin? And u guys will change this subreddit's name?:p is that what u're saying?

To answer your question: it is too risky. It all depends on how much risk you are willing to take. It's a high risk high reward kind of investment. The commodity/currency has no intrinsic value so theoretically it could drop at 0 at any time for any reason. Ofc it can also increase by 5000%. 
In summary, it all depends in how much risk are you willing to take? Are you young? In your 20s? Then you can probably afford more risks. In your late 30s-60s + you have a family? It would seem too risky to bet everything u have saved no?

@_date: 2017-10-18 18:43:58
I disagree. Anyone who is running a node and is serious about it should be able to adapt to the 2X. We're only doubling the space required for any FUTURE blocks so it shouldn't be such a dramatic situation.
Internet and storage are cheap as hell nowadays.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:47:05
Reveal your identity yes where you got your money? No. The guy makes you sign a paper that you now own the house and  in 1 click you transfer your bitcoins in exhange. That wouldn t happen in the fiat version. The bank would need to know where the buyer got the money from and the buyer's own bank would investigate any new amount the client puts i. His savings. This is the main difference. 
Grey zone? Nazi? What do you mean by grey zone? Is that your way of saying: ppl need some room to do illegal activities. If this room is not given then the government is nazi!! This is not the case. Yes you cannot kidnap people for a livimg and yes you have to pay your taxes. Not sure why that makes you a bad government or a nazi? Also communism might have failed in implementation but the ideology is def better than capitalism where 1% has more money than the 99%? But we're getting out of topic now. If your only pro for promoting bitcoin as a currency is "we need that grey zone else we are nazi" then I am far from convinced
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:50:01
I am perfectly aware that people turn a blind eye. I told you that is corruption and it can be tracked down eventually. Yes it is an exception rather than the norm. An exception does not mean something which is extremely rare /non existent. It simply means it s something that should not happen the way the system is designed to work. 
I find it silly to compare the level of control you have using the banking sector as opposed to bitcoins. In the banking system customers are subject to a kyc (know you customer) form where any transaction should be defined and approved. Yes cprruption might happen just like anything else in this world. But bitcoin? All you have to do is transfer 20millions for a few kgs of heroine to someone in a second and without any way yo trace it back to you. Comparing the two systems is just SILLY. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:20:15
Can you please explain what you mean by "accumulated difficulty"? Is that like how many blocks have been added or what exactly?
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:16:33
For torrenting, drugs... It has not completely stopped them but it certainly decreased their traffic. As for bitcoins, owning a currency that is illegal is DUMB. With alcohol or drugs you get high by using them, with torrents you enjoy a free movie what do you do with an illegal currency. Can't you see how these two words cannot be used together?
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:33:59
It's meaningless man. I already told u the chances are slim. But i was expecting someone to tell me a background check on existing keys would be done to make sure the keys do not currently exist. 
I mean if someone had a 100btc in his address and u just got extremely lucly do u just end up beig the owner of tjis fortune? Chances are slim yes but existent. Isn t it a basic flaw in the whole btc logic? Just pray u don t get 2 identical addresses?

1week? What about today s fork? Won't it create 2 currencies?
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:52:53
I fully understand your opinion. If only everyone was as nice as you are, the world would be a perfect place. Banning weed is dumb I agree but that is somewhat besides the main point. With fiat governments have some sort of control over taxes and illegal activities but with bitcoin this control is completely lost. Bitcoin accounts and transactions are almost untraceable to as the identity of the person holding then. This property is what threatens the modern society as we know it today. 
Also there is something I did not touch on yet. The currency value. For example, 100 bucks in banguladish is enough for an entire family to live for a month. Tjis is because their currency is cheap. I also wonder how bitcoins can destroy such poor economies/people.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:26:38
Alcohol is different. It's a physical commodity they can simpy ban it like they ban heroine. Close all the shops that sell it and put any new privider in jail. alcohol will still exist of course but it will be a lot harder to trade.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:59:32
They most certainly can shut it down. Corrution exists in every system and the example you just talked about is pure corruption in other words an exception. With bitcoins you have virtually no control over anti money laundering whatsoever. That's a huge difference!!!!
And yes so far bitcoin has been a simple commodity and no one cared about it. But as popularity increases, governments are taking a more serious look at it. We already see laws specifixally issued to address bitcoins ect... At this time bitcoin is a commodity and is treated as such. But can governments shut it down? To a large extent yes but like drugs u would most certainly still.be able to illegaly trade it. But what is the point of risking going to jail just so that you can get some virtual numbers? It defeats the main purpose of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:46:11
I feel like that's a wise advice. The dollar averaging technique.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:23:02
Isn't it where we are heading anyway? People need a lot of money in order to enter the mining industry nowadays. It is no longer a decentralised currency. Miners should never have as much pressure as they currently do.
Are you sure 2mb are 8mb with segwit? From what I know the blackchain is at 150gb or somewhere around that. We achieved this size after several years. Let's say what you are saying is true. Let's also assume that by next year the segwit blockchain would reach 300gb. Is seg2x is implemeted, a year from now the blockchain would be 150+4x150=750gb. 
Let's face it. Nowadays 1TB is like 30bucks. Anyome who is serious about bitcoins will not quit. This is why the 95% bullsht is just a claim with 0 basis.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:27:23
You mean illegal exchanges just like some torrent websites. But the thing is why would you want an illegal currency? The two words are opposites. You can want drugs because you get high but why would you risk anything for a virtual number on a screen? 
The moment it becomes illegal, the currency will lose its value.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:13:48
I agree with you that technically it's not the same coin. But let us say that A becomes A and B. Is A used to be worth x, it should follow that A+B should be also worth x. Now if that was tbe case thw price of btc should have dropped. Add to that the uncertainty that investors will face as to what coim will actually prevail and you get chaos in the market. What happened during the last fork cannot be economically explained. U entered the fork with A being worth 2.5k just to become 3.5k +500 1 week later. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:33:07

@_date: 2017-10-25 16:01:23
Yeah I understand. But in this case it's quite a bit different. 
They are playing for the long run. Accomodate some losses now to get the lead as far as b2x goes so the chain is named as BTC. 
After that new or ignorant investors will simply buy some BTC because this is the more popular name out there. The new fake  BTC will gain momentum and the miners will start making profits again.
Also some malicious individuals could afford losses for some time just to destroy the BTC name or any trust anyone has in it. It's like when say pepsi sells at a loss just to drive coca cola out of the market.

Yh I agree. We absolutely need the core devs ti stay on board. I just mentioned it was the only real inconvenience. Not sure about the 95% decrease in nodes claim. I don't see why 95% would.not be able to maintain their nodes. I tried to ask the guy who claimed that but I never got a proper answer.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:25:08
I agree with both of you. Exchanges are not required in theory. But it will make it a lot harder to determine the price and it will make it also harder to trade especially if it's illegal.

Nice analogy. So basically btc will be granted to the chain that has the most mining power. It doesn't matter if no one wants to trade it, miners will still be able to issue next to blank blocks and get away with it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:11:48
Exactly. Let's say someone attempts to double spend. How would POW prevent miners from reporting the transaction twice or possibly splitting the blockchain.
They cannot tell which one of the transactions should be validated simve they were issued at the exact same time. Whether they spend some electricity and computing power will not change their dilemma : what to do? Which transaction to confirm. Untimately each miner chooses one of the transactions and wr end up with 2 blocks like you just said. But how did the POW prevent that? It didn't
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:49:22
This is the real threat bitcoin is facing: becoming illegal...
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:47:18
What exactly does that mean?
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:34:15
So it only required 1 miner to log my transaction. After that the nodes start verifying that my transaction has been included in the given block.
So my question is how do nodes figure out whether the transactions recorded by the miner are legit or not?
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:44:34
I already did. From what I have gathered, it is impossible to steal your funds without having physic access to your trezor. Howevwr, I would like to know if that ks truly the case.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:53:36
Not sure how your analogy is revelevant. You just quoted a few ideas that were improbable at their times and turned out to be true. U can use this analogy to basically refute anything you want. Yes improbable thingd can turn out to be true but that goes for everything else in life.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:30:06
It's quite different. Currently bitcoin is considered a commodity and you only pay taxes when you sell for a profit. For example let s say all the employees are paid in bitcoins. If it was a bank, the givernment can see each person s account and thus impose an income tax accordingly. For bitcoins, you address is anonymous and you can easily get away with all sorts of transactions/salaries ect. It can be done with fiat but it s a lot harder when tbe banking system is workimg with the government to spy on every move you make.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:02:25
Wow fascinating. I always thought that by say 50 confirmation it meant that 50 nodes verified my transaction.
In that case is it fair to say that in order to obtain the first confirmation, every single node should report it as an accurate transaction?

First of all I am not against bitcoins. I myself am a firm believer in the technology. 
Now as to answer what you have said:  my argument was that a systen that promotes money laundering, criminal activitirs and cripple the government main source of income should not, theoretically succeed. We need our government to function and provide power, roads, water ect... We also want security and a way to fight criminals by creating barriers for them in order not to be able to use their illegal money. This is why bitcoin as a currency is not to succeed. Now feel free to answer my arguments i stead of bringing trump analogies. This is the only way yo have a constructive argument. I told you why bitcoin as a currency is a problem try to tell me whh the problems I stated can be overcome?
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:30:27
Exactly that I thought about it. But some methods can generate an address while offline. U can do it via pffline python even. It s really strange
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:23:06
Regarding your reply to money laundering: the problem is if bitcoin was the only currency in use you wouldn't need to transform it to fiat ever. You basically have a fortune to spend anonymously and without having to account for it anywhere. 
I have nothing against drug dealers. It was a random example. What about ppl who sell weapons or kidnap others for a living? Money laundering includes ANY illegal activity and I just gave one example.
You keep saying that freedom is good but when you say " freedom" what do you mean exactly? All I think about when I hear this word is a- tax evasion or b-money laundering. Why would you want freedom and lack of control otherwise? I mean surely ppl in Venzualla have a need to use bitcoins but in the modern free market you have all the freedom you need yet not enough to get away with illegal activities. Please enlighten me as to what additional "freedom" we are going to get.
Storage of value, gold 2.0. I agree completely. But then again it was not the objective of this post. My question was : will crypto ever replace fiat money and serve its main purpose :becoming the dominant currency. And currently I see more cons than pros for it being the case. I mean what are the major pros? Transanction time? Irrelevant really you can wire any amount instantly. Transaction fees is arguably one of the advantages. Security wise both fiat and crypto have pros and cons. A bank could get robbed and a noob crypto currency user can get hacked. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:28:02
Lol. Bro a fork is exactly like when ppl print fiat money. Basically u just doubled the supply of 1 currency. By basic economics prices should drop. Plus splitting bitcoin repeatedly signals incertainty in the currency s future it also signals conflict between the users . if every time ppl do not agree we split our coin what trust do ppl have in it anymore? It s no better than printing dollars whenever we feel like it.

I think you missed the point. I am not refering to the current value of bitcoin as a commodity but rather to its implementatiom as a currency.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:23:29
1- How can you trace someone selling 20million in drugs to put them in bitcoins?
2- It really does. A drug dealer could sell his mechandise and get the money in bitcoins. After tat he is just a regular citizen with a lot of money in his anonymous bank account. No one can track his activities or freeze his account in case he was arrested.
3-I agree living costs and currency value are not identical. They are however highly corrolated. The chinese have been devaluating their currency for ages in order to make their merchandise extremely appealing. This is one of the biggest economies in the world and it would probably crumble in case this discrepency in currencies no longer existed.
Now for your last point. You end up saying that there is no reason for bitcoin to replace local currencies. But then again what would be bitcoin s function exactly? If it is an alternative currency it just feels like it's there to promote money laundering. Faster transactions? Lower fees? Faster transaction is meaningless really, i can access my bank account and wire money to anyone in seconds. Fees can arguably be an advantage depending on what will happen in the upcomimg forks. Ultimately I don't see that bitcoin will be ever able to replace fiat as a currency. Perhaps it will remaim a commodity or a store of value but nothing else. A conclusion you came up to yourself at the end after reflecting on what I have said.

That's just not true. He claims not to be friends with wallstreet but that's just one of the main claims he lied about. The fact is wall street and the big companies are the ones controlling the government and not the other way around. That's how capitalism works.

Weird. And how can you be sure that the node is legit and did actually verify the block that has been issued. Wouldn't it then be easy to :
A-mine a deceptive transaction
B- use a node under your control and alter in a way it could confirm the transaction
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:24:56
What's also scarier is that this specific fork can be far more dangerous than the previous one. It won't even be clear which coin will maintain the bitcoin name... Not to mention the core dev team being kicked out and the community being even more split about the fork as compared to the previous one.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:46:42
Just to see if I got it right:
So a malicious user issues N transaction at the same second. The miners put the N transactions in the same block and the nodes reject it because it contains a fraudulent transaction.
The POW here serves whag function exactly? Let us say it did not exist. Miners attempt to put the n transactions in the same block but the block gets rejected because the nodes will not accept it. I don't see how POW is of any extra help in this particular scenario.
What did I miss?
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:37:35
You are also making very simplistic assumptions by saying 2^80. There are currently no random generators that can yield this number of possibilities. Their period is never that long. Even when u change seeds if trezor is always using tje same random number generator it will end up with a lot less than that huge number. The again the very basic argument u r presenting here is flawed.

People having their accounts blocked. Trades being terminated with no authorization ect... Anyway, I don't think holding CFDs is worth it on the long term.

@_date: 2017-05-29 15:41:23
Thank you for helping me out! Yes I actually figured what CFDs were. Their ads were misleading but once I digged into it I found exactly what you meant. I'm planning to buy and hold(long term investment) so cfds are def not what I'm looking for (especially since I am charged an interest rate and if the price drops a lot without a proper buffer my trade will close...) .
The 2 popular apps you suggested don't work where I live. Local bitcoin seems the only alternative. Bitcoins are currently trading at 2.6-2.7k... Not to mention there's a real chance I meet a "not so nice" guy so I'm not too excited about it.
I also heard a lot of negative feedback about avatrade and etoro like you said. There always seems to be issues when you need to withdraw your money...I'm glad you confirmed it as well. I'll try to keep looking but in case something comes to your mind don't forget to hit me up! I really appreciate your input.
