Happened to me, I ended up cloning blockchain.info code from github and modified the old code a bit to replace and run brute force on words from the 65k dictionary that looked similar to those i suspected was written down wrongly.
It took some time but half an hour afterwards voila!
If you know which word is wring, try to look in the ~64000 wordlist for similar words an replace.

Ok, so when the BCH pump starts you will have no possibility to fight it because you have sold it all. Brilliant , This is what the BCH camp want.... drain all sellers before pumping
So please do not actually sell unless there is an active pump going on..
and by the way.... altcoins are being pumped now... Pump capital comes from BTC and will be used to pump BCH hard at later stage.  You see, the next pump will not only be capital flowing from BTC but also from altCoins... Prepare yourselves, I am just saying....
