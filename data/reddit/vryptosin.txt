Did you know about that leak several years ago? An employee of a Swiss bank downloaded customer details to a CD and leaked it to governments. In there was several U.S. customers dodging billions in taxes. The bank was penalized with heft fines or threatened to be shut off SWIFT system.

Ta is a form if fallacy (gamblers fallacy, chances are 50/50 no matter the signs you see)
I like to refer people to a bias (or more a reasoning trap) called apophenia. Wikipedia have a good page summary of it.
We tend to look for patterns to rationalize (find reasons, any reason no matter how stupid)  our actions to avoid cognitive dissonance (was happy to see when you used it) to not feel as bad about our otherwise unsure investment.

Ask your bank first but do it anonymously. Usually if you have enough proof of how you made this money it's gonna be ok. Also smaller amounts up to 60 70k shouldn't yield problems. When you are up in the millions you need to talk ! Also there is thousands of banks world wide. Bermuda, Switzerland, korea and Japan is probably the most acceptans to crypto

Think about it, mostly basement dwellers or flat out nerds with low social skills believed in internet money back then. Now its huge but they were successful with no need to improve social competens/skills. Unfortunately they put no effort on improving them. 
While the old millionaires may have required social skills to negotiate or simply interact with others for demands, payments, negotiations and what not, early investors only interacted with PCs. 
I believe this along other reasons is why so many bitcoin millionaires brag about how much money they have - lack of social skills.
Now they can fix their appearance and put on a suit but still behave childish. Look at both Ver and Craig, both are very childish and transparent in their behavior. But not just them, Coinbase CEO write about in 2014 how hard it was to negotiate with Bitcoin team. It was recently posted here.
Well just a theory.
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:50:53
I'm not saying he was right, I just interpreted his writing as "I found it hard to communicate" and then the bitcoin developers have no obligation to comply with him. So that makes sense.

Prepare the paperwork and calendar, this is gonna take a long time both for the bank to confirm it's all green and the exchanges you sell. I would split it over maybe 3 or 4 places to sell from. She may sell to bitcoinsuisse who buys only large quantities too. Worth checking.
Edit: if you split it, don't forget to mention the total to your bank. Otherwise it's gonna be suspicious. With proofs such as bank statement of the purchases and movement between wallets it will work fine!

That's true. He did admit once that he sold all btc at 1k-ish so we know he is full of anxiety and regret but it must be very strong for his current action - like greedy strong. Maybe he had a stack of 1m usd in btc he sold at 1k and watching it go to 20k made him miss 19M usd for selling too soon. I would probably misdirect my anger and anxiety at someone else in that case too.
