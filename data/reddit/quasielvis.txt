Up to speed like you?

I used to get emails from their lawyers now and then because said I accepted their payments on my website. Not allowed to say "Western Union" for any reason, apparently.

After reading some of the comments I still don't think I did anything wrong. I think the company overracted and wrongly assumed this client backed away due to bitcoin. Thanks to those of you that gave some positive feedback and advice.
Here's some feedback: You're a fucking idiot.

LOL. You fucking dunce.

Fair enough.
I just noticed that they didn't actually prosecute the murder-for-hires so I guess the evidence wasn't so good.

Why is that? He very clearly paid someone who he thought was a gangster to have a person killed. Then when he received the staged "proof" that it had been done he tried to do it again.

1: Drug dealers, obviously.
2: Read the comment you're replying to. Procuring murder means trying to organise it.

You think it's more likely that they fabricated the evidence than he actually said those things, despite their being no real reason to believe this?
It's just dawning on me that there are a lot of conspiracy theorist types in this sub.

I agree with this, life without parole should be reserved for gruesome murders but I suppose Americans are free to run their legal system how they choose. Could get the death penalty in some countries. 
Most of what you said about drug attitudes is fair in some cases but I wouldn't always make that generalisation. Some people don't like drugs but still support their legalisation.

This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever read. Sentence was probably a bit on the harsh side but he deserves some serious jail time for being a drug kingpin. 
If you don't like drug laws, that's a different argument entirely. Perhaps you should be defending all the ghetto crack dealers with the same vigour.
