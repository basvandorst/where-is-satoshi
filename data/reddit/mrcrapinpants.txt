What will their next news item be? Water is wet?
@_date: 2016-05-15 16:42:35
You got it all figured out. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 15:41:15
And bitcoin might go to 100 by tomorrow. 
Investing in bitcoin is by no means safe or a guaranteed profit. 
At the moment keeping your money in dollars or euros is way safer. 
Investing in bitcoin is just gambling. 
Downvoted? Seriously?? What part of my comment is worth all these downvotes. Serious question. 
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:31:47
And when is the price low exactly?
@_date: 2016-05-14 20:04:29
Sure. And bitcoin might drop 50% by tomorrow. Nobody knows if it will. Your money in bitcoin isn't more safe. Actually it's way more safe to keep it in euros or dollars as any sane person would know. 
You can be a bitcoin fan AND be realistic at the same time. You should try it once.

I took a breath of air before i bought some coins recently. I think we need more articles about air here. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:19:53
Troll because?
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:53:00
In no other online community i constantly see people warning each other of obvious and very old scams. 
I mean this is the kind of stuff the internet stopped caring about 10 years ago. I don't even register these scams anymore. 
I keep reading how the bitcoin community is so "tech savvy". These daily warnings tell me otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:36:44
you really can't think of even one reason?
@_date: 2016-05-18 10:57:40
450 dollars is not cheap to most people. And if bitcoin never gets over 500 then it is in fact very expensive. 
I seriously can't believe i'm being downvoted. Why? I really like to know why. What did i possibly say that deserves all these downvotes?
@_date: 2016-05-18 15:29:10


Yes, because you are invested in it. 
Others might consider it a horrible deal. 
You have no idea if it's a good deal or not. Nobody has. 
Edit: i was talking about current prices. Obviously buying bitcoin at 1000 or something idiotic as 10000 would be the dumbest deal ever. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:19:10
Yes, so? How does any of that mean that bitcoin will do better 10 years from now?
@_date: 2016-05-15 23:30:56
Most likely this will be the case. Maybe a small pump and dump. 
Edit: i see opinions are not allowed here unless it's good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 22:27:47
There are also many smart people who don't expect bitcoin to go up in price. How is it you don't listen to those smart people. They are smart!
Oh wait, because you are invested so you want the price to go up. 
Funny how that simple fact makes all your replies pointless. 
Btw isn't Tim Draper that guy who bought a shitload of coins at 800 dollars or so? I hope you'll say no because that would make this conversation even more ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-05-14 21:22:04
I'm not sure what you are saying. Long term bitcoin is safer?
@_date: 2016-05-16 06:22:54
So that's the real goal of every bitcoiner. Surprising. 
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:12:53
No. You have no idea if they will become worth more. Nobody does. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 15:41:36
That normally never happens here!
@_date: 2016-05-15 14:17:37
Swift wasn't hacked. Try some less sensationalist titles next time. 
Anyway, every time a bitcoin company loses its coins does that mean we should switch to fiat? 
@_date: 2016-05-18 16:47:06
When, if, maybe, possibly, etc. 
I totally understand you are invested and want to get rich without working but at least try to act a bit realistic. There is no way of knowing if bitcoin ever will go over even 500. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 18:11:03
Where exactly did i give bad advice? Please be accurate. 
Edit: and silence of course. Just even more downvotes. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:45:07
Dude, there is no guarantee whatsoever that bitcoin will be around tomorrow, let alone 10 years from now. 
Just be realistic for a minute ffs! Nobody knows where bitcoin will be 10 years from now. It's very, very possible the dollar will be a way better store of value. Or the other way around. Nobody knows. Not you, not me. But at least i don't pretend i can look into the future. 
You can love bitcoin and still be realistic  and rational. Really, it's possible. 
Edit: and it's extremely sad you're labelled a troll and being downvoted here if you you're not 100% sure bitcoin will "win". 
@_date: 2016-05-18 22:16:40
So if i create anything tomorrow tomorrow that is scarce it probably will become worth a lot and is very unlikely to go down in value? Is that how it works?
@_date: 2016-05-15 08:21:10
Because you can look into the future somehow?
@_date: 2016-05-16 05:43:28
Why are you stalking me? Scary. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 13:34:53
Ah right. Aaaaaall fiat currencies will become totally worthless and bitcoin is guaranteed to keep its value. Because reasons. 
Yup, what could possibly go wrong. You've got it all figured out!
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:16:09
Hilarious. Tim Draper, a guy who is invested in bitcoin, expects it to go higher. 
Yeah, surprising. 
How nice. Someone is downvoting all my comments. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:26:47
I've read this forget about it for a year thing for years now. What exactly is supposed to happen if you wait for a year?
