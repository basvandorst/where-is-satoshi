1. I'm not sure about how you worded that, but I think you have the right idea.
2. See the second-to-last item in the picture: Transaction Fees. The miners are mining for blocks, not for new coins. The transaction fees should keep them going after all 21M bitcoins are awarded.

TL;DR: HELL YES!
P2P currency will never go away for the same reason P2P file sharing will never go away: it absolutely, _mathematically_ cannot be stopped without stopping free speech and its utility will always outweigh the cost (including risk) of use.
For reference, I present this piece published by David Madore in 2000 about using one-time pads to publish information while maintaining plausible deniability for all participants:
This generalizes to: as long as we are permitted to transmit something, we can transmit anything. Even if transmissions were limited to data which can be demonstrated to have some innocent purpose, steganography allows us to insinuate "random" data into innocent transmissions, which we could use to transmit the pads in David's article. If we are prevented from transmitting anything at all, world wide economics will quickly crumble, states propped up by reliance on commerce will fall and we'll pick up the pieces and rebuild. It will never come to that because powerful people have a lot to lose and they aren't as short-term oriented as a lot of people think.
For another example of why no one will ever close this Pandora's box, see  a technique published in 1998 by Ron Rivest which allows users to establish confidential communication channels over insecure channels without resorting to encryption (which was in a more legally fragile state at the time).
And to defend my "utility outweighs risk" premise: P2P file sharing reduces the cost of media distribution to its absolute minimum, and P2P currency reduces the cost of trade to its absolute minimum. All costs associated with either technology are due to energy consumption of the infrastructure and the costs of defending against security threats. The technologies they compete with add their own costs above this, including but not limited to the cost of supporting whatever central authorities administrate them.
To be clear, many other concerns about Bitcoin are still valid, but the idea that P2P currency could be ended entirely by motivated attackers is unrealistic.

I can't speak for others, but what I object to is how little say I have in the process. I get a vote in each election, and most of the big tax decisions are not decided by popular vote. I don't even realistically have the option to "take my ball and go home" because of how the US nearly dominates the rest of the world, economically and militarily.
However, I think it is immature to fantasize about keeping all one's income and not having an increased cost of living due to having to pay for all the services one relies on which are currently public. And that's not even taking into account the hidden costs to the community as a whole when the poorest members don't have sufficient resources to take care of themselves.

I'm thrilled to see the Bitcoin network growing and this article does a better than average job of explaining it, but I'd like to see some more realistic comparisons.
How do the MIPS or FLOPS of all IP routers and switches, and all the DNS, SMTP or HTTP servers and clients compare to either the top 10 super computers or all of the Bitcoin miners? While these protocols are much lighter-weight than the work done by the supercomputers and mining rigs, there are VASTLY many more of them.
More importantly, these are the protocols of the Internet. Bitcoin is poised to join that pantheon if it can match the others in ubiquity and reliability. I think it will take at least another couple of years for Bitcoin to get to that point, but I think it will eventually.

The state of the Bitcoin network is decided by consensus (weighted by computing power).
Suppose that you and four of your friends decide to have a currency of your own where instead of trading physical items, you just all keep track of each other's balances in your heads. You decide to each start with 10 coins. Whenever two of your friends want to trade with each other (coins for non-coins), they have to announce it to the rest of the group. 
Whenever three of your friends decide to work together, they can disagree with you and your other friend about the current balances. You have the choice of taking their word for it or abandoning the coin game entirely.
(Edited to correct my wording in the first sentence. Merely having the most nodes is not sufficient to control the network. Attackers must spend more than the rest of the network on power and hardware. Also, the three "friends" in my explanation could not claim you had spent coins you hadn't spent. They could only claim they hadn't spent coins they did spend.)

If TheBitcoinOracle is spreading unfounded rumors, their gambit is that they can drive the price of BTC high enough to sell out at a high enough profit to cover the loss of the 1 BTC they put in escrow. When their deception is revealed the 1 BTC they wagered will have been "worth" whatever they sold their remaining stock at. The math wouldn't change if they wagered 100 or 10k BTC because we have no idea what portion of their total reserves that represents.
On top of that, if this rumor were powerful enough, the revelation that it is false could drive the price below its true value and then TBO could buy back in, effectively winning twice.
To not be suspicious of TBO, one would have to believe that TBO wants everyone who reads and believes this post to benefit at the expense of those who do not read or do not believe the post.

In its classic form which refers to transistor count, you are correct in asserting that Moore's law has a physical limit, but expressed more generally in economic terms (price per unit work), it will necessarily continue indefinitely. The period may increase, but eventually any currently expensive computation will become cheap enough to invalidate previous assumptions.
The current cost of computing a hash with a similar prefix is not a sufficient indication of its integrity in the future. This is not a good way to build a secure system.

The opportunity cost in the ATM theft scenario is distributed extremely widely, so it is probably negligible from most people's points of view. However, there is no such thing as good theft or good vandalism. Eventually the entire community pays the price.
I personally perceive the established financial and political institutions as villains leeching off the people doing the real work, but stealing from them doesn't solve the problem. Even a Robin Hood story in which the ATM thieves distribute their proceeds to well respected non-profit institutions would still be a loss on the whole. The same things that make legally exploiting the system destructive also make illegally exploiting the cheaters destructive. Two wrongs do not make a right.
You may curse those who take unfair advantage of their position of power, but do not cheer for those who fight them through means just as destructive as those which got the powerful where they are. That kind of attitude just perpetuates the unhealthy power dynamic.
The only sustainable solution is to peacefully redistribute power fairly.

We know what happened on the block chain, but we don't know what really happened on the client which initiated the transaction in question. If someone claims to have had their wallet emptied but actually created the transaction themselves, they have attacked the recipient of their transaction by creating the perception that the recipient is in some way a cheater. If we then refund the transaction then a) the attack was free (making unsuccessful attacks irrelevant) and b) the miners get retroactively charged for something that they had no control over.
The answer is for people to take full responsibility for their own security. It's 2013 folks.

From what I've read, the attacks have not been exhausting network capacity; they've been exhausting compute capacity or outright crashing the trading engine. More network capacity could only help the attackers at this point.

On Wednesday they decide your milk isn't worth 4/4 pizza any more and only pay you 3/4 pizza (three slices of a four slice pizza). That is inflation of the milk or deflation of the pizza. It is also unrelated to the division going on.
What you said was they went from paying you 4/4 pizza (uncut) to paying you 2/4 pizza. The change in pizza you get is not because it is cut but because they decided they didn't want your milk as badly.

"everyone knows everything" is a higher standard than "most people know most things", which is what I meant to suggest.

Looking at the post you were replying to:


* "but other aliens" is a typo. It should be "by other aliens". 
* "is an alien, who just like Prometheus" should be "is an alien who, just like Prometheus,"
* "No brainer really." should be "No brainer, really."

The point is, there is no reason to think they didn't know any better. They were clearly joking. Pointing out that Prometheus could refer to the Greek legend will make you look like you don't understand the subtleties of basic communication. That may be true or it may not. If it is true, learn to adapt to whatever makes communication difficult for you. If not, prepare to be called on it.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought the MtGox DDoS attacks were working at the application level, as opposed to presentation or session.
If the exhausted resources are CPU and/or I/O in the trading engine, then the only way an attack can be mitigated quickly is by identifying the malicious activity and blocking it. If you can't block the activity itself, there is no amount network capacity that is going to be enough because the network isn't the bottleneck.
If I'm right, the long-term solutions will be to increase the service's capacity to process activity (through either code improvements or increased resources), identify and filter out malicious activity (very difficult, see the email spam war for reasons why) and more exchanges.
Edit: According to [this post]( I was slightly wrong. Increased network capacity wouldn't help because it just lets more bogus TCP SYN and UDP packets through, but it wasn't CPU or I/O which was exhausted, it was kernel network tables on the hosts terminating the connections. Improved filtering would still help, but changing the app or adding CPU and I/O capacity isn't going to help. Increasing the number of kernels (hosts) would help, but the attacker can always muster more hosts than the defender because of how cheap it is to run or hire a botnet.

Copying is not theft. Theft deprives the owner of the stolen thing. Even if the sale of the original creation can be correlated to a decrease in revenue due to competition from the copy, the original work was not stolen and the revenue not earned was not theirs to begin with. To claim that people would have bought the original if the copy didn't exist is to claim to be able to predict the future or read people's minds.
If you claim copying without permission isn't polite, I will agree with you. If you claim it sometimes harms society in some way I would welcome that debate because I'm on the fence in that regard.
But copying is not stealing.
This distinction is important because theft is destructive and copying is not. Before a theft or copying there are two parties and a product. After a theft there are two parties, a product, and some time has been wasted (committing the theft). After a copying there are two parties, two products and some time spent copying.

There's no way to know the headers of the email aren't spoofed. The only portion of an email which is not pgp signed that you can trust is the part written by your own receiving SMTP servers. SPF would tell you that the connecting IP has permission to send on behalf of the domain the message purports to be from but you then still no nothing about the hosts which have permission to send through it. DKIM would make more guarantees, but I would be surprised to see an anonymous email service using either SPF or DKIM since they'll want to provide plausible deniability to their customers.
I hadn't looked at the pastebin link. The message uses SPF but not DKIM. We know the sending host was authorized by safe-mail.net, but we can only trust the rest of the message as much as we trust safe-mail.net.

The 4000 BTC are unnecessary to your argument and you should list all the inventory transitions explicitly.
In both cases you start with 1000 USD, then:
* In case A you have:
 * 0 USD + laptop from converting 1000 USD into a laptop
* In case B you have:
 * 0 USD + 995 BTC from converting USD to BTC (0.5% exchange fee)
 * 0 USD + 95 BTC + laptop from converting 900 BTC into a laptop
 * 0 USD + 7,600 BTC + laptop from the value of BTC increasing 100x with 80% likelihood
This way it's clearer where the 100 (or in my example 95) dollars worth of BTC came from.
Your argument hinges on the 10% discount, so you should include the justification of that in your analysis too. You might also mention that if merchant also knows the BTC have an 80% chance to increase in value by 100x, she is likely to offer her customers incentives to encourage them to use BTC instead of USD which decrease in value about 3% per year.
Still, I found your argument very compelling.

Assign seasoned programmers to write the first version.

* What power does the authority have to correct an unacceptable collaboration?
* Who gives this authority its power?

In order for the price to drop that way, someone has to be willing to sell at those prices. The market may not appear as deep as it is at MtGox, but as soon as the price difference between the exchanges is high enough to make it profitable, someone is going to perform arbitrage.

I am the target audience, and I approve this work. Thank you.
Here are the questions I still have:
* How are miners compensated after the last coin is found?
* Is there only one chain?
* How does the network recognize and acknowledge the winning block miner? Or to put it another way, what happens when two miners find a small enough hash in the same second? Does the smaller hash win or is there some other mechanism?
These questions may be too advanced for what you're trying to convey. In any case, I'm going to browse the wiki you referenced and find out the answers myself.
Edit: 
The answer to my first question is here:  Miners choose a minimum transaction fee to be included in the blocks they mine. Users choose a maximum transaction fee they will tolerate. The higher the fee, the faster it goes through. Free transactions might go through eventually if there isn't much competing traffic, but it would be at the whim of the miners. The typical transaction fee will likely adapt to changes in compute efficiency and power costs to make sure they are as low as possible (to increase volume) but high enough to still be profitable for miners.
The answers two my second and third questions are here: 
There is a single chain rooted in a genesis block. When two or more miners add to the chain, their versions of the chain become competing forks. Clients may add to whichever they like, but as soon as they do, one fork will be the longest. Clients always build on the longest fork of that chain because it is the most likely to be legit. Rewards (mined coins and fees) from orphaned blocks are lost by the author of the orphaned block, so the network enforces a requirement that a reward be 100 blocks old before it can be transferred. The clients must obey these rules or other clients will reject their blocks.

My intuition tells me the problem's on your machine. You might be able to get a development plugin for Chrome to tell you what exactly it thinks it's doing with so much of your CPU.

Because citizens abroad still benefit from their citizenship. The US will go to great lengths to protect US citizens anywhere in the world, at great expense.

That's what I thought for a long time too. As it turns out, the difficulty is adjusted every time a block is mined. The difficulty is automatically scaled to seek a rate of six blocks per hour. That's why there's a hard-ish limit around 3600BTC per day.
If they double the rate, they'll get one block in 5 minutes instead of 10, and then the rest of their blocks in 10 minutes.

I didn't get that message from the article. It was more like "don't treat it differently." The interracial marriage quote demonstrated this point well. Here's another example:
If a parent talks about how important to them it is that their disabled offspring get a good college education, that quietly re-enforces the feeling that it is unsurprising that a disabled person is less likely to get as much out of college as someone with no disabilities. I am particular well acquainted with this particular bias because my wife did very well in college and most people's reaction was "that's amazing considering your disability."
The article said "focus on what you control - how you talk and act." The article was not recommending denial or self-delusion.
