Some people had too high expectations of bitcoin immediately taking over the world (and they getting filthy rich in process) and now when reality is not meeting expectations they need to blame.
Block size is not slowing down growth, fees not increasing is one piece of evidence for that. All growth charts of users and such show pretty stead uninterrupted growth.
Confirmations or block size has not been problem for me ever when using network.

Dude Bruce is right. We don't want regulation and regulation is unhelpful. 
Thats what you should be arguing for instead of giving regulators the excuse and justification for regulation claiming 'Bitcoiners are asking for it'.
And yes we realise regulation will come so you can stop with the condescending smugness about wacko libertarians. The point is to minimise it and you are not doing that.  
Frankly it shows complete nativity about how government and regulations work.

Anybody saying 'please regulate us' is causing harm to Bitcoin. Just because you argue against regulation and try to delay it and minimise it does not mean you can not be involved in its creation.
Jerry Brito and the 'please regulate us' crowd is giving a convenient excuse to regulators and anti-bitcoin people to create unhelpful regulation.

Talk about back-peddling. The title of your article had *Urgent* in it.
You have been constantly talking about urgency and crisis etc etc. You were wrong like many times before, yet you insult, disparage, and dismiss anybody who disagrees with you.
The arrogance problem is not with Todd, its with you.
And to quote your advice on when devs disagree with your decided project direction "If you dont like it you should find another project". Does that advice also apply to you? or only to people who disagree with you?

If they have its because of FUD not because of reality of the network. The FUDsters have to take responsibility. The reality is fees are lower then historical highs and average confirmation times are lower then historical highs.
Nobody could have left because of practical reasons, only FUD.

I agree
 Some people might not be completely happy with all details eg. Some prefer segwit as hard-fork instead of softfork, some prefer things to be sooner etc.
Unfortunately its impossible to make everybody always happy. 
Its important to be practical, **the path we are on is certainly more then good enough and perfect should not be the enemy of the good**.

Keep in mind that Gavin first proposed 20mb but his tests had an arithmetic error found by core devs so he lowered it to 8mb.
At that point core devs pointed out his tests did not account for Chinese firewall, he dismissed those concerns for months *(at that point the blockstream conspiracies started, i.e. what is explanation for core devs to not raise limit when Gavin "proved with tests" that its safe)*. Only after the Chinese miners repeatedly said so, and Toomin confirmed it with his tests did he acknowledge that.
He has a history of being wrong, which would be ok if he would not be  so arrogant and dismissive towards others. 
He has previously demanded core devs to quit project because they have different opinions, where it turned out he was wrong and they were right.
He constantly insults and disparages Peter Todd, seemingly because Todd does not agree with him.
Finally, his 'debunking' about split forks is utter nonsense, another of the many things he has been wrong about. Miners will mine coins in proportion to their economic value, thats their economic incentive, and they will mine both coins because there is money to be made.

What network attack with high fees? FFS deluded head in the sand thinking.
Fees are high because increasing adoption and price hike led  to more transaction demand.

It depends on perspective really. On one hand I see your point, on the other hand I see their point. If bitcoin.org is there to inform, help new users and promote bitcoin they have obligation to remove services that they deem unreliable or unsafe for bitcoin. Why are you OK with removing blockchain.info but not Coinbase? Its done under similar principle really.
Its a curated list. Coinbase was deemed 'recommended' its not deemed so now (like most good wallets). Their judgment criteria is strict and different then yours. Not just ease of use but safety and promotion of bitcoin network.

So if we do not do overlays, what is the plan? For Bitcoin to be a niche currency with ability to do tiny transaction volume? Increasing block size to 100mb would still make it tiny and is infeasible.

Clearly your are not opposed to all protocol layers on top of Bitcoin.
What in your opinion are the type of things the blockchain should support and should not?
As a specific example Counterparty on top of Bitcoin, you think its good idea or not?
This stuff is important, businesses building on top of Bitcoin, need to know if their business model is something developers intend to accommodate.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:43:47
Well raising the block limit will most likely lead to further centralisation. While in the grand scheme it does very little to make bitcoin go mainstream as its still orders of magnitude too low.  Systems on top of bitcoin like lightening network need to be built.
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:22:30
I believe that Satoshi also believed that most people would run a node on their home comp etc. I dont think he expected the price to get so high, so quickly. 
Decentralisation was also key of Satoshis vision.
As things are now, centralisation is a problem. Increasing block size limit will make it worse. Better but harder solutions are available.
We have to adapt to the situation as is now.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:29:58
The costs that everybody is primarily concerned about are externalities that do not directly effect anybody, i.e. centralisation. 
Over the long term, creating a system with large blocks in itself is not really an issue. A system like that can easily be engineered. 
The network might have some problems if the block size got really big really quick, but all of that is solvable long term, if we do not care about centralisation. 
In such a system increasing block size is just to low a cost for miners. The cost is the centralisation of the network.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:47:45
There is no market now. If anything what we have now is a centralised system where fees are statically set by default by central decision makers.
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:47:55
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:38:49
Bitcoins integrity and features can by easily replicated by a simple system on a few databases, that would be very scalable and more efficient. 
Decentralisation is not needed for that.
The point of decentralisation is to distribute points of control and failure. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 10:04:06
Critical questions allowed :) Its a valid comment. See my reply above.
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:25:12
Right, but increasing the block size is not necessarily the correct step. 
Bitcoins decentralisation needs to be managed and be a higher priority then short term growth.
Maybe the correct step is to start hitting the limit, let fee system be used,  incentivise 2-layer? 
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:18:29
His claim that because there is a supply curve there will be a market is demonstrably false. 
That is main takeaway of my post.
It does not mean a fee market can not exist, but Peter did not provide any data to show that it would or about the curve shape. 
Additionally I gave out my reasoning why I think it wont be the case. I have not proven that point. Neither has he proven his. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:43:44
-Small block gives a opportunity to see how Bitcoin behaves with fee-pressure and block-size pressure. This will need to happen one day. Better to test it now then later.
-If small block becomes a problem then we can easily increase it then.
-Other solutions will have to be found as increasing block-size does not scale. 
-Even with the increase the transaction capability is tiny.
-Increasing has many issues. It will likely increase centralisation. It will increase block-propagation time. It does not scale.
-Many businesses believe they can not deal with bandwidth requirements of such large blocks.
-Small block size encourages better sustainable long term solutions.

I did not miss it so you lost your bet. A short term stress test is different to seeing what happens over an extended period of real use. 
Fork can be done very quickly if its urgent. Not that it will be. Transactions will not all get clogged overnight. Fees are supposed to prevent that anyhow. There will be no catastrophe.

I mean in practice his theories will not work. They are not practical. Moving Bitcoin in a direction based on his ideas would be a mistake. I think I can say that.
The oxygen example, is a practical example that just because something has a supply curve it does not have a market. the main premise of his talk is that Blocksize has a supply curve therefore there will be a market.
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:22:01
Hey I like your approach :), I think these practical calculations are more useful then theoretical models and differential equations with no concrete numbers.
Beyond that I am not sure how it shows that a fee market would exist :) (if that is what you are trying to imply)
If fee market is supposed to be a long term solution: 
block reward will dwindle and your calculation is based on that.
Furthermore the propagation time you used can be drastically reduced due to centralisation (and the market would push in that direction). 
Also block size &gt; then data that needs to propagate. Theoretically its possible for the data that needs to be transmitted to be constant regardless of blocksize. That would completely break the orphan rate fee market concept. Therefore the calculation here does not hold: "500 B / 1,000,000 Bps = 0.0005 sec added to time to send block to 1 peer" 
You can read more about that in this exchange. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:35:01
Well the block size will be increased, just not as rapidly as bip101. Protocol layers on top will allow it to scale. I was buying things around 6 weeks ago also and did not have a problem, I doubt your problems were because of blocksize limit because we are still comfortably below it. How do you know it was?
Actually the solution to your problem now  is to have replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent implemented in wallets to make a more robust and reliable system.
Lastly the context of this thread is about ditching a developing a developing country (china) because of their circumstances/lower speeds. The example of netflix not servicing people with lower speeds is given. So yes the harder you make nodes to run the less of them will be run in developing countries. 
The point is for developing countries to develop their own services and have power and influence over Bitcoin, not be dumb consumers of western services and decisions. 
Having economically useful nodes, or hashpower are ways of having influence in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:58:49
Are you sure? Some core-devs seem not think it would be a big issue?
Anyhow, maybe its better to get through this now, rather then a kick the can down the road with a band-aid solution that increases centralisation. 
Even with increase, the amount of transactions that can be handled is tiny.

From my understanding of GST ...

That is not true. You are likely thinking of Luke, that is a myth thought out at r/btc but is not true.


There would be no corefork as Bitcoin will not fork it will stay the same adhering to the same rules. 
You will be the ones forking to new rules. 
As for the rest. Even if you want to call it an Altcoin and if its less work chain ... Attacking an altcoin because its in some groups financial interest?  
I have no comment. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:18:34
Additionly it is important to correct the belief especially common in r/btc that mining hash power before hand matters.
After hard-fork price will be set by trading on exchanges and miners will quickly adjust so that hashpower is distributed proportionally to these prices (otherwise they are making a loss on overmined coin and loosing out on potential profit on undermined coin).
If BU would fork with 70% hash power its irrelevant. If after a few days price on exchanges for Bitcoin is twice that of Bitcoin Unlimited Coin, some hashpower will go back to Bitcoin so that it mirrors the price.
Otherwise I agree good article.

It is not desirable to have a change that would split the network.
If the network is split and there are different rules, an attack on any chain to kill it is morally wrong. Live and let live.
This does not prevent split, this tries to kill a chain (by censoring its transactions btw) after a split has occurred and will not succeed and is even more dangerous then a simple split.
We want consensus so there does not have to be a split in first place.

To my understanding Roger lied when he said:
- Satoshi said the goal is not to care how big blocks get.
Roger specifically said blocks, where in reality Satoshi was talking about blockchain size and did not say blocks. I believe Roger knew this.
Also btw in Shanghai a few months ago (this should be on video) he said to the Chinese community, when trying to explain to them about censorship that: 
- r/bitcoin censors ANY criticism of core developers. That you are not allowed to criticise core devs here.
Again plain false lie. 
Criticism of core devs is very, very common here, is allowed by the rules and is not censored, only promoting contentious HF client (weakly moderated btw).
Roger must know this but is making things up to 'sex up' his case.
He is a shamelessly manipulative and dishonest person. This are just some examples but he constantly engages in these manipulative half truths and reality twists (when BU had a bug that caused fork he was trying to spin it as actually BU being correct and and core client having the bug lol, shameless) .

@_date: 2017-02-07 21:55:19
I think segwit will happen but we need to adjust our timeframes. 
It might be months possibly even a year or two or three. 
Which is not long in the grand scheme of things.
The reason I think it will get adopted, is
- it is actually the simplest way to increase blocksize and as fees start increasing there will be more pressure on the economy to find a solution.
- Same with the other benefits as time goes on there will be more advanced uses that will demand segwit.
- As time goes on the politics of it might subside. Out of self-interest the politics will shift more in segwit favour.
When its really needed it will likely get adopted, its not really needed that much now.

The vast majority is not priced out of the system and they should not be :).
Buying a cup of  coffee directly on blockchain might not be competitive compared to more centralised systems.
But that is not the same thing as being priced out of the system. 
Eg. 
The Ethiopian coffee farmer might sell his coffee to sellers across the world on chain. And the coffee shop selling a cup to a customer will use 2-layer like lightening with instant transactions that will be settled on blockchain.

Sigh... not its not false. Anybody denying that is lying. Or clueless. It has different consensus rules.  End of.
Its not interoperable. Its interoperable most of the time currently but has code that is not interoperable, so it itself is not interoperable. To be interoperable it has to be 100% interoperable. Just because that code has not triggered now does not change the fact.

The miners would mine on a forked chain. The coins that the miners would mine would be from that forkedchain i.e. altcoins.
These altcoins mined by miners would be useless because full nodes would not recognize them.
Essentially miners would fork themselves of the network. 
In theory it would mean the hash-power for Bitcoin would decrease. In reality if there is money to be made by mining somebody will step in to fill the void and make themselves some $$$. 
Mining is a paid service to prevent double spends and somebody will do it.

If even true,
 NOT Chinese miners. But SOME of the miners from China and possibly some of the miners outside China.
This derogatory and generalising use of 'Chinese' does not help.
Not all Chinese people think alike. Actually I am very confident that the article is misleading and greatly overstates the support for the creation of Bitcoin Unlimited Coin in China.

Segwit already offers a ~2mb blocksize increase. 
And that just not how bitcoin works. I am sorry but there is a misunderstanding here.
Core devs should not and will not release a client with incompatible rules that does not have estalished prior consensus through some sort of voting as it will split the network.
What you are asking for would split the network.
You can not really vote on hardforks by running different consensus client. Everybody has  to follow consensus rules. 
You can vote beforehand on which consensus rules rules to follow and if some gain consensus you can then have everybody run that client.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:45:25


No you dont you just need to hard-fork and that that nodes and users are necessary, miners are not. 
Users simply switch to new rules i.e. different proof of work.

First thing it is not blockstreams job to do this you sound like you think Bitcoin is controlled by blockstream or something.
Blockstream can not allow or not allow anything. This is a opensource decentralised project.
What you want is allowed (and blockstream has no ability to or desire even to stop it).
If somebody wants that then they should code it up and submit it to the community. Apparently they have not though. Core devs are volunteers not your employees, and can work on what they find most interesting.
If you want them to do something for you for free then you should pay them or at least ask nicely, not attack them, they have no moral or other obligation.
Part of the reason nobody actually wrote such code is that actually measuring consensus is not something that can be done easily so how can we activate when it has enough consensus. How would you measure consensus?

It says a lot about how everybody at r/btc is so happy about this. 
Its literally an attack on Bitcoin, on a   chain that they do not like. They want to kill it by censoring and stoping all transactions.
This is what we feared govs might do but it turns out we do not have to worry about USA, Russia, China or NSA, but 'our own'.
It will not work anyhow so I am not actually worried but it exposes these people. 
They might succeed in splitting to create 'Bitcoin Unlimited Coin' (and nothing wrong with them doing so) but they will not kill the original Bitcoin (which they should not even try as its morally wrong).
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:01:07
That depends how you define a block. block before segwit != block after segwit. 
What makes a block a block?
You are being misleading bordering on lying. The effective result is that transaction capacity is increased. The amount of data (however you call it) transferred over network is increased. Thats what matters. Your are just playing irrelevant semantics.
@_date: 2017-02-05 03:36:53
Ill mine if nobody will. Plenty of people keen and willing to make a buck. If there is money on the table somebody will mine out of greed.
It can also be same miners, but now they will have to behave or we could switch proof of work again which causes them huge financial harm each time.
@_date: 2016-03-05 09:56:20
Says good should not be enemy of perfect. Oppose increase via segwit first because its done as softfork not hard-fork.
He just wants to take control of bitcoin and will use any argument that to push that agenda.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:44:24
I am assuming you mean how to hard fork with out a split. 
1) You gain consensus to implement the change and move onto 'new coin'. That means coin holders and their representatives. By representatives I mean companies like coinbase which hold coins on behalf of users.
2) You implement it in Node software and wallets.  To be activated after some block number for example. This is relatively simple 
3)Since you gained consensus everybody runs that software.
4) When activated miners will mine it out of profit motive since the users which are on this coin view it as desirable. When they mine they can sell those valuable coins. The miners are not needed for permission.
They tough part is number one. Its tough because you have to get consensus (or very close to it). And also because it is very hard to measure consensus. 
You can try to guess if you have consensus by a kind of estimation, that means straw polls and going to influential companies and Bitcoin holders to ask them if they will move onto new coin.
The best way would be a coin vote but most people would not participate. Nevertheless a coin vote could still be an indicator of opinion.
If you do not care about a split then you can just skip step one. Then it is really easy.
Again you do not need to ask miners or have any miner vote before hand as after split miners will mine both coins proportionally to their value as set by users/market.
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:43:11

No he did not. He only stated it can be increased when needed. Which is position of devs.
Gavin's position of removing limit was not satoshis position. In fact Satoshi was pretty hard core against block bloat and spam. He even oposed namecoin on top of bitcoin (and introduced the 1mb spam limit which is currently doing the exact job it was intended for).
@_date: 2016-03-19 12:36:04
Bitcoin needs to be for the entire world not just rich developed countries that make small proportion of people on this planet.
Anyway, nobody is suggesting, that blocks should remain the same size its going to be increased with segwit and a hardfork next year. There are valid reasons for not increasing block size rapidly though. The issue is also not urgent, despite the over 1 year of fud predictions that did not come true.
@_date: 2016-03-06 15:22:13
It seems very clear to me the purpose was to prevent block and blockchain bloat by spam transactions which are very commonplace now and the reason we are close to limit. 
If you can point me to specific post by Satoshi that would counter my view I would be greatfull.
This is all irrelevant tho because devs compromised and will increase block size via segwit (and prbl HF in 1yr). You win. Why still all the hate and anger.
Improve and contribute to bitcoin instead ( like the devs)
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:15:53


No he did not. He said it can be raised when needed.Thats different. There is absolutely no point in having a limit if you are just going to raise it each time it gets hit.
The limit was not placed by Satoshi  for decoration.
Furthermore devs are raising limit through segwit anyhow, which is far superior. The aim of most classic supporters is simply to get rid of devs.

Developers are also talking about increasing block size, things should be discussed. 
 They have NOT released any clients and do not plan to, to change pow through hardfork.
Infact blocksize is increased through segwit and once that is activated and there is need for more we should try and do a HF.

First I want to say despite me disagreeing with you I think you have made great contributions to the community and provide a good service in shapeshift :).
1) Some people think calling Mike Hearn or Gavin a traitor an appropriate term. Its also very extreme and divisive. So are accusations of censorship, you should use better terminology.
2) R/btc and Roger Vers sites omit bitcointalk and bitcoin.org. For example he "censors" them from his "Official Bitcoin.com Links” and "Noteworthy Links &amp; Services”. Do you understand?
3) You very publicly called removing of coinbase from bitcoin.org as censorship (not just moderation of r/bitcoin as you are inferring above). I think the moderation policy is definitely questionable.
4) There was a tweet you made some time ago, it was related to RBF. I can not be bothered finding it. Its not that relevant anyway. We can not expect you or anybody else to always say the appropriate thing all the time. We are not politicians :). 
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:50:32
Err sorry, do not accuse me of lying when I am not. It does. It changes what makes a block. The data is split into separate structures. Effectively it means more transactions per second and more data being transferred by the network. 
To say the blocksize is not increased would be highly misleading. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:44:27
Without the work of core devs bitcoin network would not even be able to handle the amount of transaction s it does today.

It does not increase prices but it increases revenue. If you can lower increasing marginal cost (and you can by centralising mining) you can make more profit by producing more.
e.g. Apple makes more profit selling 100 mill iphones for $1k then 100k iphones for $10k.
If Apple could lower cost of production they could make more iphones sell them for lower price and make more profit.

It a expected and gentle brushing up that allows the system to improve. That way when acunexpected event does happen the system will be resilient.

If both are done it would not be the end of the world. I agree. 
The roadmap is more then good enough though, sure some people might think things should be done slightly differently but we have to be practical. The development process has served as very well so far.
What Bitcoin classic is doing is completely unnecessary however, it will result in a year of argument, hate and chaos. All of it so pointless. What because Gavin thinks we should do segwit as hardfork not softfork? Who cares!
Thats not enough reason to try and push through a contentious hard fork. 
No way. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:07:11
1) If you want the debate to be more civil, start with yourself and stop attacking one camp with divisive and misleading terms like censorship. If you think the moderation policy is wrong, too strict, unfair you should phrase it better (I might agree with you then:) ).
2) Removing coinbase link is not censorship its the practice of freedom of speech by bitcoin.org (thats my opinion). They have the right to promote who they believe is best. You can disagree with them but please stop throwing extreme accusations around.
r/btc and Roger Ver "censors" r/bitcoin and bitcoin talk. There is no mention of them anywhere. For example he "censors" them from his "Noteworthy Links &amp; Services”. Where is your outrage there? 
3) If you use your strict definition of "censorship" anybody could be accused of censorship, its complete nonsense that is not helping a mature debate.
4) You accusation against core devs a couple of weeks ago that they have nothing to do because bitcoin is 'done' and they are just breaking Bitcoin to make work for themselves, is also not conductive to healthy and mature debate.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:28:17
Remeber, segwit is 2mb blocks and makes it easier to hardfork to larger blocks in future (by fixing scaling of sighash). 
You will never get consensus on hardfork when an easier and better way to raise the blocksize through segwit is still not activated.

Bitcoin is functioning great and will continue to. The devs are doing an amazing job. Its a wholly manufactured crisis to gather support for a power grab.

@_date: 2016-01-20 02:24:31
Is my understanding of this correct: The aim would be to change to a different proof of work at the same time as classics hard fork. This would mean there would be a cleaner separation with two separate coins and two separate blockchains.  
I.e. transactions on one chain would not be valid on the other chain.
If that is correct then I think this is a good idea.
One problem is that SPV clients would not be able to distinguish the difference right?
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:30:21
Jeff why is this hard fork necessary? The scaling roadmap is good enough. Do you not think so? Sure you might think segwit should be done by hardfork not softfork, but who cares really. 
We can not be perfectionists but have to be practical.
This attempted hard fork is going to be an ugly affair if it even comes to existence, there is too much opposition. We will have months of fighting, chaos and low price.
Instead we could unite under the good enough scaling roadmap and move on to other improvements.

Are you running nodes that do not hold Bitcoin or transact? That have no economic justification beyond raising the number count of BU nodes?
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:11:00
Yes Segwit will increase blocksize through softfork in around 3 months. Following that there might be a hardfork increase if needed.  
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:09:15
Core devs are not single enityty but wholly decentralized large group, that can and does Disagree and have seperate interests. 
In fact classic would centralise development under small group backed by blockchain alliance.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:45:07
Segwit splits the single block into two data structures but the data structures are bigger then the single previous one so effectively the block size is bigger, just split up.
Segwit allows higher volume of transactions and its a better way of doing it then Bitcoin Classic method because it : A) provides important additional benefits (malleability is a huge pain!) B) Does it through a soft-fork.
Right now we don't really need both. Because segwit will give plenty of capacity for now, and there is no point in unnecessarily placing extra burden on nodes and the relay network.
When there is a need we can increase through hard fork.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:39:15
It's safer. It's some massive Orwellian twisting to suddenly say they are not. They just want to have hard fork simply for the sake of differing from core. The aim is to get people to use their client instead. 
That it will cause chaos in Bitcoinsystem and  price does not bother them.
 Blockchain alliance is backing the move as they want to take bitcoin out of the hands of cypherpunks and into people who are more accommodating of regulation

False, a tip dont get your info from r/btc :)


We are all 'stalling' because because the better path is to increase blocksize via segwit only HF only after that.
There is no point in devs expending their valuable skills to ungratefully work on a hard-fork for free when a better block size increase (segwit) is out there and still not activated simply for political reasons.
If you or Roger want them to do that then donate some money.
There should be no HF increase, me and many users will not support one, while segwit is waiting activation and blocked.
As such, any attempt at hardfork before segwit will certainly be very contentious and should not be released in Bitcoin-core. Non-consensus Hardforks are altcoins.
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:24:41
Classic does hard fork to 2mb simply for the sake of having different consensus rules to core and taking over network.
Its attempt of taking control is backed by blockchain alliance. Cores Segwit softfork raise to 2mb &gt;&gt;&gt; then hardfork to 2mb by classic.
 This takeover attempt will result in chaos and a price in doldrums for a few months.
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:46:26
Core developers have done more then anybody to improve Bitcoin scalability. Bitcoin does have room to grow, thinking it does not is too a large degree a result of Mike Hearns FUD propaganda.
So far users have not been effected at all despite the FUD predictions months back. We actually have plenty of time.
The segwit softfork will increase blocksize soon in any case.

Agreed, I think current segwit activation period should be extended beyond a year first.
If we have high node adoption, i.e. estimate of more then 70% of used nodes and exchanges then we can do deploy user activated softfork.
UASF should be next year with a year activation time or so.

I am gonna sell 30% of my BTU for BTC in the very early days/hours as it will be likely overpriced relative to BTC. 
Reason it will be overpriced early is people think mining hashpower will corresponds to economic value, yet looking at all metrics i.e. r/bitcoin users vs r/btc users, node count, etc. vast majority of economy is with standard Bitcoin. 
After about 3-20 days I expect BTC to have higher value then BTU. Probably at ratio of 4:1 which is roughly ratio of many of the above metrics. 
I will then sell 40% slowly over the next few months (this is kept in cold storage so harder to sell early).
30% of BTU I will keep as I believe there is some merit to different approaches. I might even buy some back maybe 10%.

No need to place unnecessary burden on nodes and network when segwit is more then enough for now.
Testing has shown the network might struggle with segwit and 2mb increase as that would effectively mean a blocksize of ~8mb. 
Segwit &gt;&gt;&gt; classics hardfork increase;  so we should unite scaling roadma and put end to this chaos and division. Its killing the price :(
Satoshi himself said that nodes should be kept as easy to run for as long as possible, when discussing blockchain-size. The same principle should be applied to block size (bigger blocks means bigger chain anyway). More and easier to run nodes means a healthier and more decentralised network.
Decentralisation is something precious that is easy to loose and hard to gain.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:56:01
And many are also supporting core roadmap. Roadmap is more then good enough. Development process had been working very well so far. 
The chaos caused by this takeover attempt hard fork is not justified. Roadmap is good enough. Simply because segwit is done through soft fork not hard fork we need this drastic action?
Rubbish, its just an excuse and propaganda to disguise their real motive which is seizing control from the cypherpunks. That's also why blockchain alliance (of which Gavin is member) backs it.

Thanks Peter but you have not mentiond the biggest bug in BU.
The 'emergent consensus' mechanism means miners can increase profit by increasing the blocksize.
The only thing stoping increasing the blocksize is the increasing cost due to orphan rate.
To optimise for profit miners will have competative pressure to reduce orphan rate and that is easily done by centralised mining.
With centralised mining Bitcoin is led to a slow permanent failure mode. You have centralised mining and centralised nodes with GB-Terrabyte or more sized blocks.
This is a massive, massive, gigantic bug that still has not been fixed by BU.

To push their agenda Mike Hearn and Gavin have presented a false narrative of stagnation and inability of anything to get done in development. 
That is false FUD. The core developers have been very effective.
 There is no liberum veto in development. There is a desire to achieve rough consensus, but it does not have to be total consensus. 
This is good as Bitcoin is a consensus based protocol. Bitcoin classic tries to push a hard fork through at only 75% hash power and without economic consensus. This will result in chaos for Bitcoin and its price.

Threshold is done to ensure miners do not mine segwit incompatible blocks.
It could lead to unupgraded nodes and spv clients getting ‘fake’ confirmations (from perspective of segwit nodes) These confirmations would be unreliable and would get reversed if majority of nodes/economy upgrades to segwit.
So in short a threshold is there to protect unupgraded nodes and spv getting their money stolen because of false confirmations.
A threshold also allows an upgrade without the majority of economy upgrading. This creates a  risk to segwit nodes though. If the majority of the economy does not upgrade miners have the option of switching back to non-segwit after activation. In this case segwit nodes longest chain is valid to Bitcoin but no longer the longest Bitcoin chain.

Anyhow Its irrelevant to my point. Sure there is a lot of problems and poverty on Russia. 
But its better to judge how a country is being run by the progress it makes. Whether things are moving in the right or wrong direction. Its unrealistic to expect anybody to take Russia from where it was in 90s and complain that it is not equal to the best in the world in terms of wealth, life expactancy etc. 
Since 2000 Russia has made unbeliveble progress. The living standard, wages, quality of life, life expectancy, birth rate, suicide rate, quality of armed forces, infrastructure built, debt as % of GDP, crime, etc. etc. (so many other things) have all made HUGE progress in the right direction.

What you say just does not bare with the facts.
The price of oil is now similar to how it was in 2000, or 2004, yet the standard of living and wealth, quality of life criteria, GDP of Russia is VASTLY greater then they were in 2000 or 2004.
Russia GDP is 4x year 2000 level when oil price was same. Average income is some 10x higher. Russia went from being bankrupt and heavily in debt to having huge government saving. 
Furthermore, many countries are even more oil dependant then Russia and have not had the same improvement. Norway is more dependant on oil but its economic growth has not matched Russias over the same time period. Venezuela and many other oil rich countries are in shambles and citizens have not benefited from the oil wealth. 
In Russia they have.
Since Russias GDP, wealth, wages have risen far higher then can be explained by increase in oil price as share of economy. Oil CANNOT account for the increase in wealth:
This has leads to following conclusion by simple maths:
1- Russias oil wealth has likely used to benefit the living standard of ordinary Russians, and not stolen. (if oil wealth was stolen or not utilised to benefit of people then non-oil wealth must have increased even higher to account for the increased income and GDP and that is unlikely)
2- Russia has increased its wealth greatly excluding oil (or resources). 
Thats just accounting and maths.

It is about priorities but also, unlimted and core devs/supporters differ a lot on the appraisal of the risk and difficulty of HF block size increase.
A lot of people beyond devs are opposed to HF and in our opinion that leads to a high risk of chain split. 
It is not as simple as changing a constant. You need to ensure almost everybody is onboard with the hardfork. Personally I would support what I would judge as a responsible hard fork increase.

That is valid point and issue. The way it is now certainly is not ideal long term, I think its a significant problem infact.
Ignoring the need for security is not the solution though, which is essentially what BU does in my opinion. 
Giving away the nodes power to control size of block is also a bad idea in my opinion. Once nodes give away that power it might be hard to get it back.
@_date: 2016-12-03 15:39:29
Pretty cool actually.
If there is an unconfirmed transaction but my or my customers wallet does not allow fee to be bumped up I can use this. Useful.
 Im guessing eventually you guys will require some small amount of bitcoin to prioritise a transaction but that is fair enough.
Also, please stop blocking segwit :)
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:31:09
Roughly: 
All bitcoin nodes validate that each block produced by miners is valid and therefore the chain is valid.
A hard fork changes the rules so what used to be invalid is now valid.
A softfork means that miners only produce a subset of previous blocks. I.e. some types of blocks are not produced. The blocks off-course are just as valid as they were before.
The effect is that only miners have to upgrade for softfork.
All have to upgrade for hardfork. Miners and all users.
 If a minority (or majority) of nodes does not upgrade they will not consider new chain valid and will possibly continue economic activity on old chain.
Bitcoin Unlimited supporters believe that old style nodes will move onto the new chain when the hard fork happens. I think that assumption is likely false (depending on circumstances). They made many assumptions before and were proven wrong by ethereum HF split.
@_date: 2016-11-27 01:32:53
I think you should be able to not propagate blocks that do not signal for segwit though. That would be an advantage for segwit miners and would not cost you anything.
If enough nodes do that then when there is a block race segwit miners win.
@_date: 2016-12-05 12:01:50
With all due respect :) That is not the Bitcoin social contract, that is your opinion and interpretation of the social contract.
Many or most people did not sign up to your definition. 
Frankly I hate to use a trope used by rbtc, but Satoshi himself said blocksize could be increased by HF.
Given that I am not sure how anyone could interpret your quote below as the social contract


HF and rule changes were always on the cards from the very beginning. Your social contract is not my social contract.
I don't think anyone has the ability to force their 'personal social contracts' on anybody else. Whether it is r/btc on us or you on us. Bitcoin is not governed by anyones personal interpretation of the social contract but by maths, hard facts and reality.
More importantly you, other core devs or r/btc do not have the power to force their opinion on us. 
If its possible to do such a thing and the tech allows it then Bitcoin allows it and thats the only thing that matters. If it brakes what sombody thought as their social contract then their social contract was wrong not Bitcoin. If anybody is dissatisfied they did not do their research and should not have invested in Bitcoin. Like you said yourself:


That is a two edged sword and some might be dissatisfied how other people use their 'freedom' and how it effects them.

I do not see any problem with that or any explanation with why that would be a problem. Any hardfork increasing blocksize will also change economic incentives. 


I believe code should be evaluated on its merit and Segwit provides heaps of benefits. Actually it arguably makes a HF block size increase easier in future because of optimisation of sighash scaling.

This is speculation **what would happen** in the unfortunate situation **if r/btc, Roger Ver etc continue to block segwit increase or any other increases!**
That increase is supported by all core devs and blocked by r/btc and Roger Ver.
You got things upside down here blaming Core devs. Btw **already on r/btc the users there are talking how they would not accept a HF increase that comes from core devs.**
We are speculating about it because r/btc and Roger Ver are blocking segwit block-size increase.


How is speculating what would happen if segwit gets blocked out of touch? Do you think that is not a possibility? It is very much possible that a HF from core devs will also be blocked, while BU is so deeply flawed it has very little chance of gaining consensus.

Satoshi changed his plan and decided that a blocksize limit is needed. He was convinced of that by Finney who believes Bitcoins destiny is to be a settlement network used by banks (I am not sure if I agree with Finney btw but thats the fact whether we like it or not). 
Limit was implemented by Satoshi and he never suggested it should be removed (he did say it is technically possible to increase it which is true). 
Stop trying to falsely hijack Satoshi, argue on merits.
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:05:41


No, because the cost to add a transaction is negligible. 
There needs to be a cost for providing security, that needs to be the biggest cost and your metrics do not include it. 
You can add that cost by having a subsidy or limiting the block size and charging fees.


This can all be done very cheaply by miners. How are we going to pay for security?
@_date: 2016-12-02 11:20:17
If there is no backlog there is no need to pay a fee (if its because of ample blocksize which you say is whole point of BU).

Not really. The fees were negligible and for all practical purposes 0. They were essentially 0 for users and essentianly 0 for miners.

With BU the blocksize limit is essentially decided by miners.
There is no market for what is needed, security. The users who need the security have no say or control over the block size. The need for security is not in your supply or demand values. The whole concept is broken. 
 


With BU users give up their power to restrict miners block size and have almost no say anymore. If miners do not provide security users have no choice but to leave bitcoin and use another coin.

Was it clear when Hardfork code proposal will be ready? 
You argue that Chinese miners broke the agreement by experimenting with classic, maybe. You are using a very strict worst case interpretation on them. 
From Chinese miners perspective they might see it as devs stretching the agreement by still not having HF proposal. To me it seems they have shown to be very patient but I think it would be a mistake to take that for granted.
Please do not take this the wrong way as I am saying this as a supporter of core devs with the best of intentions.
I just think you should be more accomodating, and forgiving of what you call transgressions of the agreement. Chinese miners are not the enemy and have shown they are willing to be reasonable and cooperate. Core devs already have enough enemies.

Its by far the most popular capacity increase proposal. 
Roger Ver, Viabtc and r/btc followers are the most vocal opponents and have stated they will not support it.
They are leading the push to block the capacity increase and improvement.
Most of the other miners said they will do it soon, or made no comment against it.
The support from other miners will grow. TBH I still have not even updated my own node to segwit supporting one (will soon).


Mining hash power does not represent bitcoiner support (esp only 2 weeks after release). All that I talk to in real life support segwit. I am not sure how you could come to your conclusion, but we will see :) .
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:26:56
In the long term those trade offs can be brought down to a really low costs giving almost zero fees. Thats why I am sceptical about BU feasibility.
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:11:11
Did you factor in fees? We do not have any trade, deposit or withdraw fees (apart from miner fee when you send out a Bitcoin transaction).
Coinspot has 1% trade fee and 0.9 % Bpay deposit fee.
After factoring the trade fee at current time I got Coinspot price $12 280. HardBlock $12 276
@_date: 2016-11-13 02:44:08
You can help with increasing blocksize by convincing miners and nodes to stop running BU and run latest bitcoin-core with segwit block size increase.

Do not know details but I would guess those hard-forks were popular had consensus and coins were probably more centralised so easier for devs to just decide.
If a hardfork change will be controversial such as BU getting rid in effect of blocksize and introducing a new economic system then its likely to lead to a split.

Thats a "fake" compromise, so classic did not compromise at all. Why wont you compromise? rollseyes. (Is that the BU argument tactic? Can we use that as well? If we do not accept it we call it fake.).
On a more serious and mature note:
There is nothing fake about 2mb segwit softfork compromise. Why not accept that it is a compromise. How is it not? If you do not think it goes far enough then say that but do not say rubbish about it being fake when it is not. The blocks are bigger, there is more data being sent in a block, there is more transactions in a block. 
Classic, BU, and XT did not compromise at all on low 75% activation threshold and disregard for nodes, which is as important for us as we want to prevent a chain split.
@_date: 2015-08-20 03:04:34
But it can still be rolled out, and activated only if it gets 90% to 95% hash rate. It does not have to get consensus immediately. 
We still have time. And it will take away the wind from the XT sails.

no, its 8mb doubling every 2 years. Thats worse then the 20mb proposal tbh.

No it does not. Tomtom is correct. Once it is supported fully by bitcoin core (scheduled for next release) segwit percentage will jump up.

@_date: 2017-11-15 04:19:09
I dont know how it works in bitcoin-qt, but the bitcoind backend, when you send a transactions it uses old style addresses and transactions.
Its possible to use segwit but you would have to use additional commands to create segwit addresses. This would mean changing the wallet code for those businesses and only using raw transactions. Its not that hard but the procedure around changing sensitive wallet code for this businesses makes it more work then one would expect.

But after I get my hash other users will add to the batch resulting in new hashing operations. Would this not change my merkel hashing path and result in a different markel root for the batch?
In fact I could be the first document hash in the batch at which point there is no tree yet!
 
So how can the .ots have the operations to make the merkel path if the merkel path is not known yet?
The merkel path for a my document is only known once the merkel root gets confirmed on the blockchain, is this not correct?

There is significant supporters of both sides. 75% hashpower is not consensus. A split is possible.
There is already a split in the community, if not the blockchain yet.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:19:05


Nobody wants that and nobody is trying to achieve that.


What you want is impossible tho. For there to be fees you will need a market. Nobody is going to pay fees as a donation, that does not work as a long term sustainable solution. They need to get something for them.

You are underestimating the impact of this. This is the main cause.
@_date: 2015-08-20 04:16:38
Its a proxy for consensus tho, that cant easily be faked. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:31:08
In that case you guys should consider merging it into master and getting behind it. This would provide an alternative to XT.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:21:50
The problem is not that it is a different client, its a client that aims to make a contentious hard fork.

For a change to be implemented it needs acceptance of nodes and miners.
@_date: 2015-08-17 00:05:36
Yes, but the previous coin will die and everybody will move to the new chain and start calling it Bitcoin, even tho its an alt coin of the previous Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:37:55
If XT forks ...
A split is almost certain to occur  as some people will not accept Gavins/Hearns coin.
Some segment of people will stay on the Bitcoin core chain which will mean it will have economic value. 
So miners will mine it because there is profit to be made. 
Service Providers will provide services because there is money to be made.
This is not winner takes all.
Looking at History, the Sunni/Shia split, the Protestant/Catholic, Catholic/ Orthodox etc split were not winner take all. This does not have to be.
It might not be in the economic interest to have a split. When humans argue tho, they often do things that are not in their economic interest. That is the history of the world.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:05:35


That is not an issue as you can increase fees. Thats why implementing some fee market over the next months/years is a better idea.
The block size can then be increased if the fees start becoming too big. I.e. demand too big.


Thats a judgement call. Some would say node reduction is already a problem. Full blocks will not be a problem that soon, maybe a year or two. They can first be solved by fee market, then by increasing block size moderately. 
By that time (5-10 years) scalable solutions like lightning network should be ready. 
Block size can be increased for the second time also then.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:59:57
Who bailed on what deal?
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:52:37
Nobody says to stay at 1mb for ever. In any case its irrelevant, its an alt-coin because the blockchain will be different.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:03:37
If money is not used transactionally it will likely not be money for long and not a good store of value either.
All things are important for money, decentralisation, divisibility, and ability to easily use in transactions. 
Both sides are wrong when they put one above the other (decentralisation, transactionability).
 
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:02:32
There must be a degree of self delusion to think this has nothing to do with XT release. There would not be a flash crash if the price did not get pushed down from 260 to 230 in two days.

Fees are necessary as reward for miners. They are intended to be the primary payment for Bitcoins security. The Block reward is a temporary bootstrapping mechanism.
They are also necessary to put a reasonable cap on block size. The block size cant be (almost) boundless. 


These issues will have to be dealt with as a fee market will have to exist. Its going to have to happen. Its not a choice. Might as well start dealing with it as early as possible.
I am optimistic that wallet implementations etc. will find ways to create good user experiences. None of these problems are unsolvable. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:28:31


You make the mistake of thinking the original coin will be worthless. It will not be so miners will mine it.

Hey I support you guys, but some compromise might be necessary. An increase to say 4mb might not change the fundamental problem. But an increase like that will however likely be needed at some point even with better scaling solutions.
 Also you guys need to agree on some concrete, formalised (long-term) plan/roadmap even if only for political reasons.  Even if the plan is wait for two years until fee market develops, then increase to 4mb etc. 
Some people think you cant agree on anything (I know its not true). They think the project will get stuck and can not improve in the future. A road map will ease those fears. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:43:59
Not really both coins can hold value. In fact this is already true. Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin and both Litecoin and Bitcoin exist. There could be Bitcoin Classic and BitcoinXT in the future.
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:59:25
75% is still contentious. A hard fork should only be implemented with at least 90%-95% support.
Also the single mining excuse, is not good enough to dodge the traditional consensus rules. Miners are free to change pools. If more then 25% choose to mine on a non-XT pool that means there is no economic consensus and we have a contentious fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:05:34
Without ability to use in transactions it does not have use case either. Both are important.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:32:12
x2, everybody is free to fork off or create their altcoin.
 (And they can call it whatever they want without asking Mr. Cobra or anybody who deems themselves CEO of bitcoin for permission).
Thats what I have been telling the big blockers for 2 years, they finally forked off. Good on them.
Some fanboy fanatics from Bitcoin are now attacking them for it which is wrong. 
Not only is it wrong it is probably telling as it means they must be slightly worried whether their extreme no fork, small-blocksize position is the right one in keeping the value of their coins long term.

Right now we have open and decentralized development open to anybody. Classic is an attempt to change that. To exclude the cypherpunks and centralise development under pro state devs like Gavin and blockchain alliance.

95% was always used for SOFT FORKS! and there was never a problem.
If you do not have 95% hash power or more then you do not  have consensus then you do not fork. Tough luck. Bitcoin is a consensus protocol.
btw I do not believe any single miner has close to 20% mining power anyway, only pools. Miners can switch pools.

Governments can enforce rules and shutdown large operations. They can not control individual users and nodes.
Individual nodes run by users make bitcoin censorship-resistant and highly decentralised.
Thats also why Torrents work. If you could only seed or share if you were a large operation, torrent would be ineffective. 
(which is probably why inventor of torrent network is highly against classic coup, he understands the economic incentives much better then Gavin and co.)

So much for decentralisation, Bitcoin was not meant to be run through back room deals like this. Its coup in action.
Some devs code and improve Bitcoin (including real scaling solutions).
Other 'suits' like Gavin and Jeff do little coding and instead engage in lobbying, blogs and PR. 
Unfortunately they have been able to sway a segment of public opinion through their FUD and manufacture a crisis thats reflected in price.

Classic is more centrally controlled then core. Just a few days ago Oliver closed a pull request to increase hash required to 80%. No discussion no community engagement. He just decides. Miners said they want 90%. 
Certainly centralisation is a scale, not binary, core is more decentralised then classic. A tiny group of people has absolute decision making control of classic. Core has large number of contributors and no decisions are made without their input, even if that slows development, no consensus changes are made without the vast majority of their agreement (unlike classic where tiny group does whatever they want ignoring others).
The views I am calling FUD is the rubbish about blockstream. Yes it is FUD.
R/btc and bitcoin.com is censored also. You will not find any mention or link to bitcoin.org bitcointalk or r/bitcoin there. If bitcoin.org removing coinbase link is censorship then that is also censorship.

There is too much of a cult about Gavin.

Total rubbish, its not needed and this is FUD propagated by Mike Hearn and Gavin. I sent transaction yesterday and it got confirmed under ten minutes like always.
If we focus on science and fact, not FUD, Rusty Russel showed that transactions have not had any change in confirmation delay.
A wholly manufactured crisis to launch coup.
edit: Its such a ridiculous claim. So there are businesses that would exist if limit was increased by hard-fork in 28 days but will not if we increase it via segwit softfork in like 60 days. okie. Most of these businesses are probably years away from being finished and actually having real customers and use cases. This is just FUD to push hard fork and take control of Bitcoin.

This is a selfish power grab, plain and simple.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:28:15
x2 You can support segwit and disagree with other opinions of some devs.
I dont agree with everything core devs say. I agree with a lot of what they say. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. ffs to many sensitive egos and prima-donnas in Bitcoin.
I think it would be good to increase block-size moderately.
But in that case blocking segwit is absolutely stupid unless you are interested in some political games or conspiracy theories. 
If a good block size increase HF proposal would come along I might support it also.  In the meantime segwit is a huge improvement to bitcoin and a needed blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-02-06 14:03:42
Well lucky for you we are getting an increase with segwit anyhow. I think the need for it is based on FUD propagated by Mike Hearn 'crash landing' stories. We could go for at least a year with no increase without any significant effect.
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:56:53
T0 would not work with 2 or 10 or 20 blocksize. Segwit allows payment channels in future so that's the best way if u want that kind of capacity. 
Also segwit is not going to be used for years still. It has nothing to do about raising blocksize in28 days or 80 with segwit.

Actually in terms of importance of code Pieter and Greg Maxwell probably done the most work on the consensus critical code. Gavin done the relatively simple rpc methods, creating testnet, bitcoin faucet and p2sh which he kind of messed up .
Certainly he made valuable contributions, but there is too much of a cult. Why the work of the other core devs who done the lions share is under-appreciated.

Softfork that cleans up structure and removes mallabeality, improves transaction capacity, adds opcode extensibility etc and can be rolled out immediately on a need-to basis,
is FAR superior solution then ...
a lousy 1 mb increase, chaotic, rushed hardfork that will trigger without consensus (75%) that should only be activated after everybody upgrades and gives centralised control to racist scumbag like you ('muslims are parasites and I will use state force to censor you but give me power over bitcoin because of ... ummm censorship' :rollseyes) and your scammer friend from Cryptsy, Marshall Long.

Satoshi placed limit to stop spam and blockchain bloat which is what its actually doing now, as most transactions are spam. Few actually pay standard fees and these have no problem getting through.
Even spam transactions have very little trouble getting confirmed.
Satoshi said the limit should be raised when needed and it clearly is not needed now. When it needs to be raised it will.
In-fact despite not being needed it will be increased through segwit, thats a compromise.
Yet some people are pushing this hard fork, regardless, to try and get the network using their nodes and not core nodes. They want power over bitocoin network and its direction. They are pushing unnecessary hard fork and avoiding the usual consensus process. Thats why its coup.

It is irresponsible, chaotic and bad for the ecosystem. He is attempting to force through a contentious hard fork that puts users Bitcoins at risk and essentially threatens them to switch or face financial loss/ be forked off network.
It is going against the traditional vision of Satoshi of a consensus network.
Its like putting a gun to Bitcoins head.

Transactions that have proper fees have not had confirmation times effected for last 2 years. Rusty Russel done study on that.

Anybody is free to contribute and they are actively encouraged. Some developers got funding (including Gavin who does no development but political lobbying and PR), thats a good thing.
Most developers are not affiliated with blockstream. They do not have to agree or support blockstream. blockstream cant not stop developers contributing if they want, it can not control their opinions, Because it has not control of development. Its just a collection of individuals contributing. You are welcome to contribute as is anybody else and nobody can stop you.
stop spreading FUD
Everybody can have client that they prefer. The thing is you are trying to get people to stop using core and use your centrally controlled client that breaks from consensus and would make core incompatible. Thats the coup. Its done with false pretence of lifting block-size by 1mb. But that is useless and there is better solution. The real motivation is power and to exclude the cyptherpunk type element.

What would be really helpful in surviving the attack is to have some easy to use service or tool made and ready beforhand that will be simple to use and will allow for splitting of Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x.
Something like shapeshift but we are not sure if shapeshift can be relied upon.
The tool/service would allow you to provide 2 addresses, you would send Bitcoin to the service, and would get Bitcoin and B2x back on the two seperate addresses.
The tool/service can even be a profitable venture.

Erik, I do not think a moderate blocksize would be bad if done right. Fees are unnecessarily high and will rise again soon. 
There is no way segwit2x has consensus however. Bitcoin is global. There are brokerages, exchanges, local traders, and other businesses all over the world.
You are not even aware of the existence of most of these economic actors. Its highly unlikely that most of them will run segwit2x. 
Bitcoin has moved on from 2011 and you and a handful of your friends from the US conference circuit might own substantial businesses, but you do not in any way come close to representing consensus.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:19:32

There is no way on earth you can say segwit 2x has consensus.
Most nodes do not run it and huge amount of business of varying sizes have not signed up. Not to mention vast majority of developers. And it has little support in some of the biggest community sites (like this subreddit).
Thats the facts regardless if you think its good or bad to increase blocksize (I think a small increase would be good actually). Its true regardless if you think devs are stupid or not, regardless if there is censorship or not.
There is no credible way anybody can seriously claim segwit2x has consensus. Substantial support maybe, but DEFINETLY not consensus.
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:29:21
Nodes with economic activity are what forms consensus as the only accept valid blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:32:42


Its certainly possible that you are right Erik. But have you ever been wrong about anything in your life?
Is it not also a possibility that the vast majority of devs and so many members of community are right and you and segwit2x supporters are wrong?  Some of these devs have been working on cryptocurrency years before even the existence of Bitcoin. 
But its not just the core devs who disagree with you either, dont make the mistake of thinking that.
 It is possible that devs, and this subreddit overestimates its support but its possible you overestimate your support.
If you are wrong however, what happens in November could be catastrophic for Bitcoin with a large split with huge amount of hashpower on one side initially, but split economy. Hash power could alternate between sides as people try to establish prices for different chains. It could be utterly chaotic. Different businesses and people loosing very large sums of money as  transactions are sent on different chains because people do not know or disagree what is 'Bitcoin' and what is not.
The downside of you getting things wrong are pretty big.

If you wanna buy a beer or coffee, for $3 you would pay around $0.8 in fees. Thats ok but not great.
Anyhow most likely in weeks the fees will rise again. By next year they will likely be close to $10 or more.  
Also segwit did not contribute much to the lowering of fees. Its only 2% of transactions and insignificant. Its likely that if there is a big upwards price movement fees will shoot up again.
On my exchange my customers do 100-500% more transactions when prices rapidly increase.
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:16:15
Was gonna post more or less thing. This is a very realistic possibility. 
E.g. Scenario.
B2x forks with say 60-95% hash power. It turns out market values B2x at 20% of  original Bitcoin price. Many miners make a loss. Some gradually move back to mining original Bitcoin.
After 2-3 weeks of creeping up original Bitcoin gets more hash power then b2x.

Segwit scales Bitcoin on chain which is what Viabtc and bitcoin unlimited want to block.
'off-chain' solutions like lightning still use valid signatures for each transaction and are backed up to the blockchain eventually so are secured by proof of work. It might not be perfect but its still very good and to scale we will need off chain and onchain scaling.

I agree fees should be kept low and there is no need to maximise fees. They are being kept low and have not been increasing. In fact at some points they were higher. This means lack of blocksize increase has not slowed growth. 
So we have not reached capacity yet and doubling blocksize with segwit will keep as going for around 2 years.

Most of those people hate anything that comes out of the core devs because its core devs. Thats the reality and I will not sugar coat it.
They talk about technical debt and ugly code but none of the people who say that has any significant understanding of core code base or segwit. They are speaking from total ignorance. 
There is only 1 critic of segwit that has some understanding of code base and that is Jeff Garzik, even his contributions to core have been pretty minimal compared to some other core devs.

Segwit is the fastest option to increase blocksize/capacity. 
The reality is some people have ramped themselves up in a circle of hate that they just want to win over 'their enemies' rather then caring about actual scaling.
@_date: 2016-10-15 07:44:50
Sorry but you are wrong. There was a soft limit on blocksize. Around a year ago it was 0.75 mb max now its 1 mb max, before that it was even lower.
Furthermore the actual transactions have been growing steadily.
Lastly optimisations and work by core devs allowed network to handle the growing transactions, that is scaling by any sort of definition.
-The Technical throughput/capacity of network has increased. 
-The real transactions have increased.
-The soft-coded limit has increased.
-The only thing that has not increased is hard-coded max and that is going to be increased via segwit (unless some jokers manage to sabotage it).
@_date: 2016-10-23 11:46:55
- segwit is the fastest way to scale on chain. Viabtc might block it but it still means its only 10% from activation. Unlimited is 90% from activation plus 5000 nodes from activation (hard fork requires all nodes plus super-majority of hashpower, softfork only hashpower).
- increasing blocksize slightly will not hurt decentralisation, but removing blocksize limit,  as with unlimited, certainly will. 
- contentious hard-fork and split will only slow growth and adoption.
@_date: 2016-10-31 08:40:23
tldr: Miners can not force a hardfork on fully-validating nodes and economic majority, no matter the hashpower. Thats one of the core designs of Bitcoin that the author does not understand.
75% is not meaningful. If a proportionate or more part of economy does not move the new coin will not have significant value and the miners who switched will be facing huge financial loss.
At that point they will turn off miners and both coins will have very long confirmation times. 
They might switch back to the chain where most nodes and economic value  reside in a desperate effort to again start making money and not go bankrupt.
Miners follow the Nodes and economy not the other way round for HFs. If Bitcoin miners tomorrow decide to mine DanielCoin, DanielCoin will be just as worthless and they will be forced to come back to Bitcoin with their tail between their legs. This is exactly the case with creating a BU altcoin.
The HF enthusiast were very confident before and were proven wrong by ethereum. They are confident again and are wrong again, but risk doing large damage to Bitcoin. In the meantime Coinbase users are still waiting for their eth classic. Something Coinbase laughed off as impossible before eth HF.

First thing core is not a single entity. Second if segwit does not get enough hashpower it does not activate. Disappointing but there is no need to 'compromise'.

Consensus of miners does not = consensus. You need consensus of entire network including all nodes and businesses for a hard fork to not result in seperate chain.
Many blockstream critics do not seem to appreciate that point. Thats why hard forks are hard. You need consensus of everything.
There was significant opposition to lifting block size outside of core devs. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 03:11:42

A hard fork is not a voluntary upgrade in your opinion?  
Its debatable that it would take that long. Nevertheless, even if so, its still the fastest option. What do you believe would be the fastest way to proceed with scaling at this point, Jeff?
Certainly if a softfork has not enough support its unlikely that a hardfork will find it easier to get more.

Over a year ago most core devs apart from Gavin were not very public.
Gavin was very public and was seen as project leader, Satoshis heir etc.
Naively, increasing block-size to allow transaction seems like an obvious thing, I and most others thought so 2 years ago.
Gavin could not convince the devs to accept his proposal about urgent need to drastically increase block-size i.e. 20 MB. 
So he went to the public to make his case and go around the core devs. Many people took his side and core devs were presented as blockers to what seemed like a no brainer to increase the blocksize.
At that point many people started to hate the core devs as the core devs were lobbying against Gavins block size increase. 
Mind you with hindsight the main concerns of core devs were correct: 20mb was to big and the network would not have been able to handle it. Gavins activation threshold of only 75% mining power in the face of strong opposition meant a contentious hard fork that would result in split currency. Gavin said split currency could not happen because of economic incentives. Ethereum hard fork proved him wrong.  
I think part of this is that people want to get rich off of bitcoin. They are under the illusion that if we only increase the limit we will get a 'tsunami' of new users that will make them wealthy. They think the current limit is stoping adoption. Bitcoin devs by stoping the increase are getting in the way of them getting rich, and that is probably a big motivation for the hate.

I did read that when it came out. As the title suggest it really is about work in progress not a finished proposal. There is a only a few paragraphs talking about Lukes work. 
The blog does not even mention that Lukes "proposal" lifts the blocksize. How much does it lift it too?
 As I understood the blog, it described Lukes work as possible example of how we can do a hard-fork. In this case it mentioned experimenting with wrapping a HF in SF.
To me any to most people this would not be a fulfillment of the agreement. 
Its not really a serious tested proposal that is available to users or miners to run or even signal. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 04:06:06

I recently argued with Greg Maxwell saying that I think devs did not hold up their end of HK agreement. Also, go on bitcointalk and within 5 min you will very aggressive hatefull talk about blockstream and devs.

He calls blockstream scumbags and their conferences scumbag conferences.
People like him are exactly the type who need to be called out.
 
Spreading venomous filth and attacking people for no good reason then claiming righteous indignation when anybody makes any criticism of the technical understanding of his 'side'.
Sorry, I will say things as they are and not sugar coat it. The rbtc 'devs' or followers do have have the technical knowledge to even implement segwit as hardfork or make any judgment on it.
These truths need to be said. But lets get to the meat and potatoes.

If you are building a website and optimize it to perform better so it can get more users and the users are increasing, is that not scaling?
The Bitcoin network has been optimized and the user and transaction count has been increasing. I honestly cant see how anybody can claim nothing has been done about scaling :). 
Which is not to say that other ways of scaling including increasing the cap are not needed at some point (possibly soon) :). 
I agree with you that cap needs to be increased. regarding its urgency. I think the cap is only a issue when we start seeing consistent fee growth to the point where fees are around $0.1-$0.5 per transactions.
I think we are not too far from that point (0-2 years) so it would be great to have segwit soon. :)

To clarify, a hardfork that does not result in a network split requires all nodes. Which is practice is what most miners would require as most do not want a split. 
Yes Bitcoin is designed like that. Thats a big part of what gives it value i.e. immutability or close to it and change only through consensus.
Nobody has veto power though, the opposite in fact, its a permissionless voluntarist system.

It would take too long to do hardfork and achieve full consensus for it. (It may not even be achieved) Softfork can be done immediately.
Segwit hardfork would break a lot of backwards compatibility so long activation time and consensus would be important.

I follow developments pretty closely but could not find what you refer to as Luke first proposal (I will have a look but if possible could you like me to what you refer to?).
I only recall the one that lowers blocksize and gradually increases it that was released early this year if I recall.
It was presented as the fulfilment of the HK agreement. It is clear that had the miners known what would be presented they would not make the original agreement.
Do you agree with the above statement?
As such I do not think the devs fullfilled the agreement in spirit. 
BTW Can you see how you hold the miners to a strict interpretation of the agreement that you claim they broke, but hold the devs to a loose interpretation that you claim they full-filled.


I  disagree but that is neither here or there. That was not part of the agreement. It does not really matter if the devs think there is support or not.
Devs promised to make  a proposal that would satisfy the counter-parties to the agreement (that has not happened). 
It was then up to the economy to judge the support of the proposal.
Maybe you think its a bad agreement. Maybe that is true. In that case it should not have made it. But if it was made it should have been fulfilled, and yet the devs have not presented a HF BIP that would be satisfactory to the miners as envisioned in the original agreement.
That is how I read the situation, maybe I am wrong about some things. I was not there in the room. Apologies for that if so. To me it seems like I am correct.
EDIT: I referred to Greg, but Greg himself was not present at the agreement and did not sign it.
 
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:36:09


That situation is impossible for longer then a few days as miners will be making huge losses on old chain, and giving up profits on new chain, somebody would step in too mine on old chain out of self-interest in profit.
If 60% of the economy switches to the new chain, 60% of the mining will switch to the new chain very soon after, it can not be any other way. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 23:03:19
No I am not saying that. The devs cant do what they want because even with soft-fork you need consensus of miners so its them who have that power not devs.
Furthermore what the devs can implement is limited by the consensus rules that are validated by nodes.

Litecoin with segwit is simply a better version of Bitcoin now.
Litecoin has higher onchain capacity and better ability for 2-layer capacity. Plus better smart contract ability.
If we do not activate segwit and continue to in-fight instead there is real danger of Bitcoin falling behind altcoins.

I really can not recall that they did. Not before early 2017 when the agreement really expired without being fulfilled completely by the devs.


For onlookers we are talking about the initial proposal by Luke.
Does it actually increase the witness size to 2mb or more by end of 2017?
If it does, then it somewhat fulfills the agreement but should have had at least a BIP assignment, and should have been promoted to some small degree. 
I follow developments much more closely then most Bitcoiners and I was not aware of it (and still am not sure what it does). 
Is there any blog or anything that explains what it does? Thats all part of making a proposal to the community tbh.
It arguably should be available for download, possibly also allow users and miners to signal support of it or not. 
Some commits hidden away in a repository is not really a serious proposal. Maybe evidence of work in progress.

It has no requirement of the network to activate. 
It can be mined immediately. The percentage that is required is that of the miners not of the Bitcoin network.
It can be activated with 0 adoption from network beyond miners.
Hardfork requires 100% adoption from network before activation.
Thats what I mean when I say soft-fork is immediate.

@_date: 2017-05-17 16:59:29
Greg I think you are doing a lot of valuable work thank you for it :). 
I am also a big supporter of segwit.
But to me it looks like the devs who made the agreement did not honour it in spirit and arguably literally.
Its possible that there are some facts I am not aware off. But if I feel that way it is likely some miners also feel that way.
I think the transgression you speak off was very small and inconsequential, and only by one miner. The miners did kill of classic and its momentum. Under creative interpretations of the agreement you could argue it did not even brake the agreement as they only signalled but did not run classic in production.
The BIP by Luke was released very late and only satisfied the agreement schedule by a very creative interpretation.
Your are holding the miners to a very strict interpretation of the agreement but the devs to a very loose interpretation.
The BIP released was not what was meant by the agreement. If the devs presented that BIP at the actual agreement the miners would certainly not agree to the deal and kill off classic. Its understandable they would feel deceived.
It was also pushed and promoted very half-heartedly.  
@_date: 2016-05-17 23:10:00
What matters is the real consensus as defined by Bitcoin protocol and maths.
Not social structure consensus.
Bitcoin is based on maths and hard predictable rules not social structures, thats Fiat and dollars. Not Bitcoin.

-Because its proposed by blockstream and core devs. 
-Its an alternative to a hard-fork which is what some communities want. They in effect want to 'win' by getting their way irrelevant of the actual issue of throughput/scaling. They do not want core devs to 'win' by having segwit instead of hard-fork.
So mostly because of ego, and hate.
@_date: 2016-05-17 22:58:22
I think it was obvious that it has to be coded up and tested first? 
When I say its immediate I mean once miners consider it finished and ready they can immediately mine it and nodes who want to can immediately benefit from it.
With hard fork everybody has to first wait for consensus of miners and all nodes and for everybody to switch to the new rules before any activation.

Most of the code in that link seems to be from months before the agreement. I don't know much about it and cant really read the code. 
I do not think it was seriously proposed and another poster said it did not even have a BIP assignment. To me it seems this does not fulfil the agreement. I am open to be shown I am wrong.
I am confident that the miners who made the agreement would not sign up if this was what was meant.
You argue that strictly speaking, it does fulfill the agreement. 
It could be argued that strictly speaking the single miner did not violate the agreement either as it only signalled for classic and did not run consensus altering code in production therefore fulfilling the letter of the agreement.
I think the single miner did violate the spirit of the agreement but it was a relatively minor violation, they only signalled a few blocks. 
In my opinion you are holding the miners to a very strict interpretation of the agreement, and the devs to a very loose interpretation.
With regards to BU. That was way after, when a HF proposal was to be made that would satisfy the miners, but was not made. 
The agreement effectively expired at that time and the vast majority of miners fulfilled their end, and successfully killed off classic.

As it turned out after facts came out it seemed that the case against Shrem was very shoddy and seemed like a regulator trying to gain publicity possibly for a political career.
The pro-regulation people, and that includes Gavin, ditched Shrem like he was poison, and he was one of them before.  
Mike Hearn


The US DoJ did not seem to have large piles of emails from the head of compliance at HSBC showing him buying drugs and helping known dealers to evade his own controls. With BitInstant they do.
It's really no wonder Bitcoin businesses can't get bank accounts, when guys like Shrem were putting on a respectable face and doing that kind of thing behind the scenes. Silk Road and those involved with it are by far the most damaging thing that could ever have happened to Bitcoin, especially so early on.
The comment was made a day after Shrems arrest. There were other similar comments by Mike.
As it turned out all Shrem done was email some guy where he can buy weed online. HSBC installed special deposit holes for drug cartels to drop in suitcases of money, but supposedly HSBC 'knows nuffin!'.

No, the fear was and is that if the blocksize is too large it will bloat the blockchain too much, as fees would be too low. Fees are not too low now and a small increase is warrented and available yet some miners are unwilling to implement it.  Fees of 0-3 cents are too low and would lead to bloat, fees above $1 are unnecessary high right now when there are no 2-layer solutions available and blocksize is only 1mb.


He was wrong as it was not urgent, that was written two years ago and until 3-4 months ago there was no problem. In fact Hearn wrongly predicted that due to capacity problems Bitcoin network would die by December 2015 (his capacity cliff prediction). No such thing happened and core devs were right, Hearn was wrong. 
Infact a solution was available and could be activated 6 months ago but it is not due to the politics played by some miners and businesses.
The devs done their part and delivered a way to safely raise blocksize immediately, when the fees were around 10 cents per transaction (end of last year).
After delivering a solution to the problem its up to the economy, us, to push for it and adopt it.

Whatever it is they want, its wrong for them to hold the network hostage and block capacity increases because others do not pander to their particular needs.
If they want devs to create something they want then should pay them for it. 
I am a dev and I dont work for free. I assume you do not work for free either. The network got a great method to increase capacity, the work hours and testing on it is worth millions, yet we got if for free due to the volunteer work and genererous donations of devs and companies like Blockstream.
