This type of sites are exactly what we need to increase more activity for bitcoiners. Because businesses like these offers more diversification for bitcoin investors in pm market, it helps to bridge the gap between the two different markets and their investors.

The admin says on his own post that he would have already confiscated the funds from the players account if he didn't withdraw it already. He doesn't deny it at all. Yeah he is over the top for sure, but I think the core idea is still very important. 
Edit: ok it's from a page previous to the one on the link.

What a sad waste of an awesome opportunity ignite some newly needed interest in bitcoin to the proper community of audience. 
This Amir Taaki guy can't even make sense of his own thoughts it seems. He was speaking randomly about nonsense that just wore down on my concentration. Of all places, I didn't expect Max Keiser to bring on such incompetent person on to interview.

Don't forget that they also emptied out Fort Knox. There isn't any gold left there. Now that is a real double whammy. They stole the value of the dollars we hold and took all the gold that used to back the dollar.

I dunno.. talking about doing illegal things with it the first thing seemed to work well for this guy..

It's dumb how the auction portal website does not verify the allegro account of the seller to be the one owned by the seller and not the one linked to a deposit account of a market site. 
This is in no way the fault of bitcoin. Just like ebay needs to make sure the seller paypal account is the one that he owns, the website elektroda needs to make sure the seller allegro accounts are verified before allowing these transactions to occur. 
Saying this is due to anonymity of tor or bitcoin is ludicrous.

We are making history here. This is one giant step for mankind.

They deserve it for supporting solidcoin which directly trying to leverage the bitcoin network hashing power to pump the value in it then dump it on bitcoin economy. 
All they are doing is shaving the value off bitcoin by actually making them believe that Solidcoin is actually more than a tease that keeps adjusting difficulty to lure the greedy&amp;stupid. It's nothing more than trying to take advantage of the less educated in a more sophisticated level hiding behind the bitcoin opensource saying it's a valid fork of it. Fuck off I say.

The worst thing from MTGOX debacle is not the debacle itself, but the reduce fee BULLSHIT that is STUNNING GROWTH &amp; SPAM.

Really enjoyed reading this even though I already have a pretty good understanding of Bitcoin. Quality writing and will forward this to my curious friends.

I wish that I can be there in person. It's going to be an amazing event for anyone involved in bitcoin. I just hope there will be a way for people outside of Europe to tune in via livestream because the guest line-up looks  very solid.

Eligius keeps it tight always. If I had to choose one, Eligius would be it by far. 
Merged mining and anonymity is there along with unique way of payments to miners which allows for virgin coins. They stand out for many reasons and the person running it is a competent dev for bitcoin as well. 
Defintely worth recommending, but no interactive website dashboard because almost everything is automated which might be daunting for some to set up.
@_date: 2011-07-11 15:08:41

support for namecoin in long term will be crucial for bitcoin's success. 
@_date: 2011-10-05 12:26:29
It certainly will happen and it's only a matter of time until we have enough intelligent people understanding how bitcoin works. Once we reach critical mass, there is no turning back. 
@_date: 2011-07-20 18:59:11
Sounds to me like you are the one who has a personal interested in this site, not me. Apparently you don't agree with me and it's ok, but it's obvious you are on the side of the website. Likely one of those teams that cheat players and take advantage of bad players if I had to guess.

One of the best discussion of bitcoin that isn't misleading
@_date: 2011-07-03 17:09:56
this list is worthless. basing on address for the bitcoin in the account is stupid and this sample is only of the 810 addresses of thousands of clients that have 100s of address on each. Pointless information is pointless. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 14:19:48
It's our job to promote bitcoin with the correct info. The corrupt media outlet will never report bitcoin under the right light. It's not rocket science and we should expect the practice to continue for a while. 
This is exactly how we need to get rid of the myths that the media wants to surround bitcoin with. To dispearse the smoke and mirror so that the general public will see it for what it is. 
@_date: 2011-10-20 14:05:44
As much as I would love to see a bitcoin rally, you are likely preaching to the choir. And I don't think many new people seeing the news of the crash would want to jump in right now because of so much negative coverage. 
It will gather some interest of a few as media coverage has in the past. Hopefully we are picking up some innovators in the industries that can help bitcoin grow. 
For now, it's more or less in need of correction from the speculative bubble which is going to be a good thing for bitcoin. We just need to let it play out and find a true bottom now and not be afraid of it. It will recover after. 
Price of bitcoin isn't as relative to bitcoin's future success as people may believe it to be. If bitcoin was going to end, it wouldn't be because it went down to less than a dollar per. Negative coverage distroying confidence is probably worse than the price itself dropping right now as bitcoin economy isn't that large to sustain it's current price anyways. 
@_date: 2011-09-06 21:07:11
This post is full of shit. If you were doing 10Ghash at only 2kw, you would be profitable mining all the way down to about $1.
Now if you were dumb and trying to post sensationalist crap to start trolling, I guess there are plenty of stupid here to come add to this nonsense. 
Go away. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 14:17:35
I would never put any of my bitcoins in a bank. No need for interest for a deflationary currency. No need to repeat the mistakes of the past.

why is price going up and down at a exchange market news worthy all of sudden? This is natural part of the process is it not?

Hey I'm just telling my own experience. I've never had to wait for more than 2-3days max for a reply other than the time they were down for a while. I had to get my account out of review status and it was fine.

If you are having trouble opening and closing the bitcoin client.. then I suggest you don't adopt bitcoin now and wait until your mom is using her bitcoin client on her 2 year old android phone. 
I'm probably doing you a big favor by not allowing you to lose bitcoin when you likely won't have a clue about protecting your wallet after installing the client properly. I wouldn't feel safe recommending it to every user who may not be able to fend for themselves with no technical insight whatsoever.

Yet another sh*tcoin to trying scalp value from the bitcoin community. Gather around stupids, it's that time again. 
@_date: 2011-08-01 12:24:57
Terrible idea. The community needs to stay together in one place. Doesn't matter is the community of made of trolls or not. It is what it is. A growing project that is going to face some growing pains. Doesn't mean we need to separate the kids in a growing family because they can't get along. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 01:01:55
I feel that it's their loss and not bitcoin's. Why? because when they do realize what it is, they will get involved anyways. It's just now or later. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 22:26:22
FLAT MONEY! 
@_date: 2011-07-20 17:23:37
Hello. First off, I'm just someone who looked at the thread and thought it deserved some attention. Maybe you are right to possibly think that because I can clearly see the abuse in power here and empathize greatly with the person complaining in a political standpoint. 
But what you are highlighting here is the problem in itself that the guy speaks of. Admin is saying that the guy didn't actually multi log, but if he did multi log, then the admin would have taken the money? Then admin goes to say that he tends to agree that it's ok as long as it's not as the same time? Why, then, did the admin even come in and threaten the poster in the first place?
These statement just goes around in circles. Poster clearly said he never did create this problem and admin can't show the cause of action for his threats beside changing his position on the topic.

I've had many dealing with MtGox. They may take a while sometimes, but Mark or Neo has solved my issues everytime. You have to understand that MtGox is growing right now along with bitcoin and they are certainly experiencing many growing pains. Don't think of them as your enemy, because they are the big part of the bitcoin community atm. Try being a bit more patient and don't misinterpret simple quick replies. 
If all else fails, you can also join them live on  on freenode. Neo is almost always on top of things if it's during business hours.

Now this guy KNOWS what bitcoin is all about and what innovations make bitcoin to be at a unique technological advantage in comparison to PM backed currency or fiat currency. He put the article together so eloquently with precise details without getting bogged up in the technicality of things.
