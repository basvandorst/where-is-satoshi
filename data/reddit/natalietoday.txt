If I do (by some laughably small chance) get a payout, everyone in this thread is getting bitcoin from me.

As evidenced by quite a few posts on the front of today/yesterday, I'm pretty sure scammers already know about bitcoin.

Someone's gonna like the way you look

The Visa I added is a debit card, and it was able to successfully verify near-instantly.

I totally get where you're coming from; even more so because, since I don't actually have more than a few hundred satoshis to my name right now, I'd be giving someone a bundle of *cold hard cash* and expecting them to pay me back over time.
The main reason I'm attracted to the concept at all is because I came across [bit-miner]( which appears (on the face, at least) to be pretty reputable-looking, and the shares seem reasonably priced. I made an account just to look and see if I could find an FAQ of some sort (which I didn't), but I did see what looks like a list of past payouts. Of course, that kind of thing can obviously be falsified, but it made me curious enough to ask. Thanks for replying! :)

That was always going to be most of the plan regardless :) Thanks for the reply!

Not by default, I don't think; I had to enable mine.

I don't have that new limit yet; however, my first purchase from Coinbase is still "pending", so I presume once that's "complete" I'll have the new mini-limit before the 30-day wait is done.

Yep. Identity verification done, bank account verified (after what felt like an unusually long time), Visa verified (much faster), first purchase is "pending".

The original price. My order last week was at about $330/btc, and that's the amount that was taken out from the bank.

Yep, regularly takes 5 full business days pretty consistently for me. Place an order on a payday Friday, funds get taken from the bank account on Monday, coins are delivered the following Friday.

Yeah, just like how Reddit automatically turns your password into asterisks if you type it! See? ***********
