I don't know of any offhand.  As far as GLBSE goes, I'm not too sure except that it went down and some people got burned in the process.

The way it worked was that once the mining started, 100% of net profit went to ASICMINER shareholders until everyone received dividends of .1BTC/share.  After that period, each share receives 1/400000th of net profits as dividends.  There are around 160,000 shares that were released.  The other shares are held by the parent company Bitfountain which is not publically traded.  It wasn't structured as share dilution, but rather a shareholder protection initiative for publically traded shares.  Bitfountain shares did not receive this benefit.  Actually, another part of the contract guarantees that each share of ASICMINER will not be diluted and will remain at 1/400000th share.

It took about 3 weeks of mining to hit .1BTC/share, but that was about 6 months after the IPO.  I think the dilution protection was set up more as a guarantee that no relative loss of value would occur.  What you're describing is a split, which I don't think anyone wants to deal with.

For whatever reason it sounds like some securities got lists of shareholders and others didn't.  Also it sounds like a lot of securities that had BTC on GLBSE never got it back.  I'm sure there's a thread on bitcointalk that has details.

Wouldn't the best solution be to design a cryptocurrency that can be merge-mined with Bitcoin (ala Namecoin and Devcoin) with properties conducive to colored coins?

No, I'm not that invested

The big reason companies issue post-IPO shares is when the overall value of all shares is increased.  In the Bitcoin world, this is usually mining companies that are raising funds for better hardware, and will result in a higher Mhash/share.  In one sense it is dilution (each share is a smaller percentage of the company), but in another it is not (more value per share).
And yes, I am extremely happy with this investment.  It was part of a diversified portfolio, and it more than made up for losses when GLBSE went down.

.1BTC when BTC were worth a lot less USD.

I bought in a decent amount at the IPO.  It's the single best investment I've made.

My router just bit the dust, and I have some coin sitting around.  I'm placing an order.
