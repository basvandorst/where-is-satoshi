I listened all morning, from 6am to 2pm.. your quote is correct, but on several instances they did not read as per your quote. It was more like "South Korea is about to ban crypto currencies"..

@_date: 2018-01-15 01:32:53
Maxed out? The number of people in the world who own any BTC at all remains miniscule... This current dip will be looked back on as a wonderful opportunity to buy. Been hodling through all the dips since 2015. Patience.... 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:03:58
Andreas... you deserve every BTC donated... you are the real Bitcoin Jesus. Keep up the great work.. and I hope the community continue to add to your hodlings.

This is probably the most sensible and credible post I've ever seen on Reddit. I'm in.. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:48:18
You're absolutely correct. The only way the US can get rid of its debt is inflation. Or war of course..
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:26:18
Yes, but I am pushing 60.. so have to keep diversified. If I was 20, I'd be 100% crypto!!
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:56:07
Every sensible investor sould have a diversified portfolio. Stocks, Bonds, Gold, Emergency Cash, Bitcoin and a few of the smaller cryptos like LTC, ADA &amp; EOS. Ignore Mommy...... 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:46:34
I've been hodling since 1998.. and I'm sticking.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:28:00
Still down.... 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:57:38
There will never be 21 million BTC due to lost coins from the early days... maybe 18 million one day.. Needs to be the 1/18,000,000 club....

From the man who inherited over $400,000,000 in the 90's.. and if he'd just put it into an S&amp;P index fund, would be richer today than he is, after all his business dealings.. He has no clue about BTC..
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:58:42
They use the term "hold" to hodl" too...
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:09:19
Appreciate your sacrifice..for the good of the hodlers everywhere..
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:54:41
Welcome back little fella..!!
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:50:51
What a total moron this man is. Did you know, if he had invested all his inheritance in the S&amp;P 500 when his father died, he would have more money today than he has.. He ain't that smart...Give me $400 million back in the 90's.....
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:32:25

Cramer is personally worth $100,000,000... gained from the current Wall Street system... so he's hardly likely to bless cryptos...  The guy's a clown, albeit a clever clown.. 
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:57:33
I remember when people thought it impossible to hit $10,000.... way back when it was about $100.. so yes, $100,000 is totally doable, although probably take a good ten years.

Yes, aged 60 here, and at my age you learn to ignore the noise and hodl. Been through all the stock market crashes, and learned the ones who just sit tight are the winners. Don't trade Bitcoin. Accumulate it, and learn to love the dips. How I wish for a huge 60% crash.....

No, Andreas needs an hour long interview... so somebody like Charlie Rose on C-Span. Oh wait.....

Yes it's true. Little known fact. I read it on the internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:30:45
We're not in a dip, we're well into a correction. But good news I think, shaking out the weak hands and getting ready for the rally after Monday, when the dreaded futures impact hits. Don't be surprised if we see $10k again before $20k.. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:35:57
You can gift $14,000 worth of Bitcoins to any one individual, or as many individuals as you like, each year... tax free.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:03:43
Fair enough..
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:53:36
Monday BTC will be at a new ATH.. when people realize that futures are mainly long and not short.

Hodlers of BTC on Coinbase last August fork date will be issued an equal amount of BCash on January 1st.. Only if you have BTC on Coinbase last August.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:25:06
Come January 1st when Coinbase holders are issued their BCash........ just watch BCash plunge...

@_date: 2017-12-11 23:53:23
I've got a question.. as a long term hodler and believer.. but this has been bugging me. What will happen in the future, when less BTC can be mined, and miners have to reply more and more on transaction fees, as opposed to mining. Won't the fees rise?? As transaction fees are currently a major criticism of BTC.. what will happen if miners cannot mine as many BTC and have to increase fees to survive?? Who will be left to handle the transactions? Grateful for any thoughts.. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:25:05

I remember a few years ago when fifty of the worlds' top economists said that if the US ever hits $20,000,000,000,000 national debt, it will be the point of no return. Well, we're there..... Just a matter of time before this money printing nonsense collapses. You think 2008 was bad???

Makes sense, thank you. Yes I also forgot to mention the threat from quantum computers (China!)... so agree there will have to be some changes. Trust the BTC developer community are up to it.

The ONLY way for the US to reduce the debt is through inflation, which means the US$ will become worth less and less over the next twenty years. Gold and Bitcoin, can't argue with that... Kim Dotcom may be an eccentric character, but he speaks words of wisdom..

@_date: 2018-05-26 17:26:07
I believe that it all depends on the "area" that their trademark "Bitcoin" covers.. for example I could trademark the name Apple for a Plumbing product, but not for a computer. I am familiar with these troll companies that trademark everything they can find, send out cease and desist letters hoping a few will start paying, wherease if they actually took you to court they would not succeed. So I doubt their trademark "Bitcoin" refers to the cryptocurrency.. and therefore would not stand up in court agaist someone using the word in reference to the cryptocurrency. Just my two satoshis..

I find it hard to believe that in this day and age that the intelligence services could not find out who Satoshi is.. or was..... Personally I believe he is most likely dead and his 1,000,000 BTC will never hit the market.

Racist?? Obviously from someone who has absolutely zero knowledge of Rhodesia.. If I could be bothered I could tell you stories of such brutality and murder against the white farmers who had established 200 year old family farms .. but I'm not even going to bother. I was there and lost many friends in the most gruesome ways imaginable. Let me guess... you're under 30?? Read a book or two before you flag me for "being racist".... and maybe take a trip to Zimbabwe some time and take a look. Talk to people there, both blacks and whites.. you might learn something.

Buffet is the greatest investor ever.. but he did it through traditional companies, not disruptive technologies. He has always been late to the game in tech..

@_date: 2018-05-08 21:39:24

Just too many people waiting to get into bitcoin, standing on the sidelines for a buying opportunity/crash that will never come. I can't see us dipping below $4,000 ever again.. Personally I would love it.. Looking to join the 21 club real soon.. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:02:58
There are many many people just waking up to Bitcoin.. it may seem expensive today, but the demand will be there on any dip.. we will never see sub $4,000 again I believe. Just wait until the big institutions start buying.. CNBC you need to start talking about one of the greatest investments of the 21st Century! Yes this is one of those once in a lifetime opportunities to still get in on the ground floor.. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:23:49
I have many friends anxious to get into Bitcoin.. they are all waiting for the "drop"... Any dip below $4,000 will be agressively brought up quickly. Bitcoin is heading to $5,000 real soon, and $10,000 by the end of 2018. JMHO. Just do it.. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:22:06
Yes you can hodl BTC and have a wife.. just never ever tell her about your BTC. I know..........
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:08:35
Hodlers still buying... 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:32:49
When is Jamie just finally going to admit that he is Satoshi??
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:19:22
Andreas is the greatest.... we should all support him with a few Satoshis.. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:40:24
No, BTC is the right decision, just be prepared for the volatility... 
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:41:55
Too many newbies just waiting to jump into Bitcoin.. every dip will be taken out very quickly. $5,000 soon, no sweat.. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:23:08
Until death... you'll have to take them from my cold dead hands..
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:12:18
Bitcoin is dead.. again.. I'm buying.
@_date: 2018-06-21 02:18:39
I'm not an Economist, but I play one on TV. I'm bullish.
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:57:32
No sweat..forming a nice base at 10k...
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:13:43
The halvening is coming...... 
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:40:14
Why oh why don't they just install Norton Virus...??
@_date: 2018-06-18 22:03:47
lost forever.... probably as much as 20%... very good for those who own BTC..
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:36:18
Both..but vast majority BTC baby...
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:42:14
Anything involving Romanians...... gotta be careful..
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:34:54
I'm in..
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:26:42
Bannon is a very smart asshole though...
@_date: 2019-10-31 19:40:22
Alcohol clears the head...
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:57:37
Scam.... run away..
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:34:34
and the Devil's music, "Rock and Roll".... it's destroying the minds of our youngsters... and get off my damn lawn!!! 
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:47:48
50% BTC, 25% LTC, 25% ETH.... done.
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:39:05
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:53:12
It's magic internet money..
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:46:15
Get those 9k memes ready....
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:22:11
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:16:37
The weak are selling... the strong are hodling.. the smart are buying..
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:47:59
Good to see...we needed a bit of a crash...
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:49:38
Trezor..buy directly from Trezor though.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:33:26
Thanks for removing a few more from the supply...
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:36:47
Gave up with Coinbase after months seeking support... went to Kraken, customer support response always same day..
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:23:26
It's gone...makes our BTC more valuable...
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:15:53
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:21:03
Just keep DCA every month..
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:57:37
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:30:32
Been in BTC since 2014 and experienced many "deaths" of BTC... this too shall pass... $10k end of the year. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:09:55
Amazing... wish somebody on CNBC would take this up with him one day....
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:52:41
Trezor... simple
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:56:27
Andrea's Antonopolis..
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:20:23
Only fools sell...still in the very early days..
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:58:17
So no different to the Stock Market...
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:33:48
Please...use your BTC...it all helps to promote us..
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:03:52
So ironic... the wealthy criticize BTC while hiding their fiat offshore... 
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:53:24
Sound advice..
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:27:21
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:03:18
Chuck-E-Cheese token...love this analogy. No threat to a decentralized  BTC at all......
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:54:07
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:13:03
It's the Chuck-E-Cheese token of crypto..
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:37:54
Yes..in my opinion. Great customer support.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:22:52
A dollar from 1917 is worth $0.02 in 2017... that tells you all you need to know about fiat currency.. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:43:27
I do feel sorry for poor Jamie though... not only has he got to sit across from his BTC owning daughter for breakfast tomorrow morning.. He's then got to walk into his office and face his staff...... 
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:25:42
Just do it and pay taxes on the gain..
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:23:41
BTC is the reserve currency for all alts... just hodl BTC..
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:24:12
Don't trade.. just DCA and hodl, whatever happens. Takes guts when it drops.... balls of steel.. but think about ten years hence..
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:47:42
Mug's game to try and trade this... just hodl and relax.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:51:32
Sell at 20k you will regret it..
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:27:15
and Jamie Diamon called Bitcoin a fraud....
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:42:03
Yes smart ass... 
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:50:07
Zuck Bucks just like my old Chuck-E-Cheese tokens.. same technology..?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:24:16
Try Kraken.com .. I have no complaints.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:31:48
Sataoshi is long gone... and his coins will never be moved. RIP oh Great One..
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:25:15
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:16
Thank you.. picked up one more.... was this the big Crypto-Wednesday sale??
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:57:48
Just start talking about mBIT's instead of BIT's.. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 19:39:14
I think the IRS is still trying to work out how to handle BTC....
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:09:45
Just hodlin' and not sweating the numbers.... even if BTC was $20k tomorrow I wouldn't sell.. Here for the long term... $0 or $100,000.... Either way.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:04:14
He made a profit.. well done I say!
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:36:22
Beanie babies and tulips...and used by crimimals...
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:11:07
Great guide..
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:27:22
Satoshi Nakamoto is actually Jamie Dimon..
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:18:23
59 here... Get off my Bitcoin! You young whippersnappers...
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:44:35
Yes, when you sell.. Capital gains tax, long term CGT if you held over a year, short term CGT if you held under one year.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:26:23
Be careful... your fake Wells Fargo accounts will be closed... 
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:05:01
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:00:12
I knew it.. all along.. Satoshi Nakamoto is actually Jamie Dimon. Clever.... very clever...
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:54:43
2). I don't believe Satoshi is alive, and I think those coins will never be moved.. Just my two Satoshis.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:42:31
Sold at $400.... very proud of my profit.... 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:16:32
Pay your damn taxes. I reported my BTC gains whenever I sold, and sleep well at night. Who do you think is gonna win this one??? Those who forgot to report should file an amended return, 'cause one day all those Coinbase records are going to be released to the IRS.. Just my two satoshis.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:45:07
Do it.. u gonna be rich!
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:00:25
And that fiat dollar in your pocket from last year is now worth about $0.98.. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:43:41
Read an article in the Financial Times once, pyramid scheme.. tulips... etc.. sold half my Bitcoins at $400.... thank God I hodled the other half!!!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:05:39
Could be as much as 25% of all coins were lost in the early days.. Great for us hodlers.. there will never be 21 million.... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:01:10
He was always a CNBC favorite too..... the corrupt House of Saud.... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:44
Your name.. your tax bill. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:45:55
BTC is still cheap. Hasn't been adopted my the majority of people yet.. you hodlers are a tiny tiny percentage of the population.. Once the first BTC ETF opens up and the institutional money starts to flow in, buckle up... 
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:56:36
Huge news..
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:49
It's all part of the Natural Selection process.. Ditch those friends and surround yourself with smart people... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:52:22
Good to see mBIT's being used... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:43:01
When your Grandmother starts buying BTC.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:55
Sold 10 back at $4k..... don't feel bad!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:48
I like Kraken.. always had a good experience with them.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:24:16
Baby Boomer here... in BTC since 2014... you young whipper-snappers..
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:07
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:04:01
OMG BTC JUST HIT $8226 !!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:50:41
The only bubbles are the salaries, benefits and bonuses of the Banksters, Politicians, and Wall Street crooks.. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:18:25
Would be the story of the century if Satoshi revealed himself... probably when he's the world's richest man?? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:00:34
I found Kraken wondeful after Coinbase...
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:48:55
Scam... stay away.
Just my two Satoshis..
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:59:03
I'm in until death....
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:53:56
Long terms capital gain tax if held over one year, short term capital gains if less than one year.. like a stock.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:57:03
Great interview.... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:18:20
Calm down.. and carry on...
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:31:28
Relax.. you have the seed..
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:08:33
Are we there yet Dad ????
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:06
Laughable the way the weak hands are moaning.... just hodl and come back tomorrow... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:54:56
So tired of the "bubble" talk.... the dot.com bubble was a bubble... the number of BTC hodlers in the world remains miniscule. Just getting warmed up..
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:09:29
You're probably right, no way to really check...
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:16:06
I remember well the dot com bubble... everyone, literally everyone, was playing the market. At the moment, the number of Bitcoiners remains miniscule... this is no bubble. Far far from it... 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:21:18
I think we will have dips, maybe corrections, but no crash.. not when you have 100,000 new accounts being opened per day. Those new accounts are buyers... the number of BTC owners remains extremely small.. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:46:37
The number of folk who own BTC is still miniscule... this is no bubble.... Just gettin' started.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:37:56
Been waitin' for this dip.... nice!! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:16:58
Yes.. mBTC will attract more investors... too many people tell me that a BTC is too expensive ;)
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:26:16
I remember a few years ago, a group of leading economists said that once we hit $20 trillion, it is the point of no return...... and here we are.... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:15:00
We broke Wall Street...
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:34:01
I'll hodl even if it crashes to $2k... in this for the long term.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:45:37
But how can he be a money launderer if he doesn't use BTC??
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:30:24
BTC now... it's dipping..
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:07:51
Makes sense though.. in the early days when they were priced in cents.. many were lost. Good for us hodlers. There will never be 21 million of these babies.. 
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:18:37
Welcome my friend.. just keep buying and hodling..
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:02:08
I guess about 16,000,000 in total... a lot of coins were lost and gone forever during the early years.. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:02:23
Done.. was feeling a little sick this morning too...
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:19:41
Not yet... just hodlin'................
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:13:15
Dollar Cost Average in over the next few weeks... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:26
Hope it drops to 8k.... 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:00:20
Natural Selection in action.... but sorry for your friend.. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 14:47:03
Kraken.com is good.. great customer support.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:41:13
So out come the religious nuts...
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:22:21
Never bet against the mighty BTC..
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:40:45
Actually there will never be 21,000,000 Bitcoins... a lot have already been lost in the early days. Some estimate 20% gone forever.. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:37:49
Maybe CNBC will stop fawning over this crooked "Prince" now and asking him about his opinion on Bitcoin.... 
@_date: 2019-06-12 02:13:07
Please...the Zuck Coin a challenge to BTC..?? Nah....
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:09:22
I believe there are services out there that can help..keep asking..
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:44:53
Going to do all my Xmas shopping at Overstock.com ... support these vendors!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:42:14
I see BTC as becoming the reserve currency for all cryptos.. and a great store of value. Digital gold..
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:33:31
Oh the folly of youth.....
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:26:54
All hodlers should use a small part of their holdings to use and buy things...important to promote BTC..
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:24:10
And for the years 2016 and 2017 they will have ALL your Coinbase transactions... the Feds ain't stupid..
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:29:35
Move to Hong Kong... zero Capital Gains Tax..
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:51:12
But I though Bitcoin was the choice of criminals??? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:52:11
Nice... I like it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:51:38
Oh my God..quick sell!!!!!
Tulips !!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:42:59
Half now and half later.... in the long term it doesn't matter. Just hodl.. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:08:41
Plus maybe three million already lost in the early days...
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:05:28
The IRS would be interested only when cryptos are exchanged for fiat.. switching between cryptos irrelevant. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:28:21
Wish I'd brought some BTC back in 2019 when it was a ridiculous $12,000....
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:19:35
Jamie Dimon ?
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:11:53
Yes Kraken...great customer support.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:32:16
Damn...and I haven't started my 14k meme yet...
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:23:10
Not ugly enough. In fact I've never seen anything so beautiful to my eyes..
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:52:08
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:29:53
No.. of the 16 million coins out there.. maybe a quarter have been lost in the early days.. over half the rest are in cold storage... so the available number of coins is small. We're talking about the whole world people.... the first truly global digital store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:36:39
I reported gains when I sold on Coinbase.. I suggest all do the same. This is 2013-2015, but you think eventually they're not going to get subsequent years from Coinbase and other US exchanges?? And on transactions under $20K?? Can't fight the Feds.. Pay yr taxes people. Sleep well..
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:26:49
If this happened, BTC would move up $2k in a day...
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:40:17
God you people are so dumb....... Jamie Dimon is Satoshi Nakamoto. I read it on the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:46:38
No, everything smooth with Kraken.. had terrible experiences with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:47:37
Not when you have like 100,000 new accounts being created every day on the exchanges.. the demand is just starting. The % of bitcoiners is still miniscule... Sure we may see dips and corrections, but the days of 75% drops are gone.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:55:23
Slowly slowly catchee monkey..
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:35:53
The big money hasn't even tipped their toes into the water yet. Bitcoin hodlers remain a miniscule percentage of the population. The fun is just beginning..
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:10:43
Excellent news... 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:14:26
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:47
You'll have to prise my BTC from my cold dead hands.... 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:25:11
Just remember.. the number of people who own any BTC remains miniscule.... the party hasn't even started yet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:50:16
59 here.. and early BTC hodler since 2013...
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:20:10
Why is BTC still so cheap?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:58:48
I'm only really talking about folks who sell on a US exchange like Coinbase.. those records will all one day be in the hands of the IRS, whether other Bitcoiners believe iit or not. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:19:06
Best post today..
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:03:40
Greenspan?? One of those old Juden responsible for that ticking National Debt Clock..
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:44:22
There are no rules anymore... the old charting doesn't work with BTC. It's the internet in 1990.. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:12:20
Explain that a 1917 fiat dollar is now worth $0.02 in 2017, just one hundred years later.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:00:41
But how does it end... that's the question.. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:04:09
Is nobody else astonished that Satoski Nakomoto is unknown?? In this day and age??? I find it hard to believe. There's a lot that us mere mortals don't know..
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:11:50
Of the 16 million BTC out there, probably 25% have been lost in the early days... I would guess half are then in cold storage... being hodled.... the number of available BTC remains miniscule.... no bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:56:09
Oh how they mocked me when I invested at $200... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:20:31
Why is BTC so damn cheap still??? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:30:26
How they laughed at me buying BTC at $200.... Sure it can reach $20k.... infact I expect it before January 2019.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:29:49
Still controlled by Governments...
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:30:18
Ask merchants if they accept BTC... and spend a little BTC too... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:46:11
Love that "BTC is the reserve currency for all cryptos" comment...
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:34:36
If they start using mBIT more often in quoting the price of BTC, it will bring in more people.. psychological tweak I understand, but effectiive..

I see Bitcoin as beiing more store of value, much like gold.. while other alts will be used for other functions. However many alts are issued, BTC will remain strong.

It's estimated up to 20% of Bitcoins have already been lost forever.. lost during the heady days when Bitcoins were very cheap. It's good for the rest of us hodlers, as it means the maximum number will never be 21 million... Yes, you loose your keys or seed, you lose your coins.

Hodling not sodling...
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:50:42
Just tell them to google the National Debt Clock in action, and explain that only 21 million BTC will ever be issued.. Even gold mining continues every year to the tune of 2500 additional tons.. but BTC will remain a true store of value, as it can never be printed..  quantitive easing as the government call it. A fiat dollar in 1917 is now worth $0.02... that's what happens to fiat money. That should do it... 
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:32:00
I use Kraken and Coinbase to buy. Prefer the former, as Coinbase has like zero support, and Kraken good support. Then use Trezor to store.
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:18:40
Kraken.com, Trezor, Yes..
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:57:30
Under Kraken Pros... surely you mean Limit order, not Market order.... 
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:03:23
Also.. Coinbase account holders will not actually receive their Bitcoin Cash until January 2018.. complicating the issue more.

Of course that's what I mean... sure there will be some serious dips to come.. but BTC will survive and thrive in the long term. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:51:34
Maybe yes... but I think is going to be incredibly confusing.. for example if you move coins from exchange to wallet, but still do not sell.. this will be reported? I would imagine the IRS is still tryig to work out how to handle bitcoin. I don't think most people are trying to avoid tax, I'm not, they are trying to comply, but extremely difficult to understand how to do this.. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:32:52
I'm lovin' this dip... anyone selling and not buying now is missing a wonderful opp. Hodling for ten years..

I'd like to see more common usage of smaller denominations..mBits and so forth.. I hear a lot of people saying they can't afford Bitcoins at $4,000+ so they are buying other alt coins.. yes I know does not make sense, but smaller denomination Bitcoins will have a psychological effect on adoption.

A year or two ago the Financial Times wrote a damning article on Bitcoin being a pyramid scheme.. reminds me of Paul Krugman's great predction..  A winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Paul Krugman wrote in 1998, “The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‘Metcalfe’s law’—which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants—becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”

Hodlin' since 2015... I just enjoy the FUD... shakes out the weak hands. This too shall pass. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:24:55
Relax people.... this too shall pass..... Hodl..
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:38:38
20k at one time transaction..
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:33:51
Don't feel bad, a lot of us do not truly understand 100% what is taking place at the end of October.. just hodl on your Trezor, and use the exchange to keep buying, before transferring to Trezor. At the end of the day, whatever happens end of the month, BTC will continue to survive and thrive. It cannot be stopped, and BTC will be the winner, the greatest store of value we have ever seen.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:11:46
duh.... humor
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:26:58
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:26:34
BTC all the way..

@_date: 2017-10-21 16:56:47
You only owe tax once you sell, or yes exchange for another crypto.. in theory even when you buy something with your crypto. I suggest you keep accurate records of all your transactions. You don't owe taxes for hodling.. At the moment exchanges do not pass on information to the IRS, so it's voluntary if you want to declare, but that could change one day.. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:43:22
Kraken, and you can just wire some funds to your account.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:11:09
You're still in a very exclusive club.. welcome.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:32:33
Good for you. Be prepared for volatility until the end of the month, but hodl fast.. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:01:07
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:31:56
Tell them you need your bitcoin to invest in illegal tulip bulbs..
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:57:01
Just move your BTC to a Trezor to sit the fork out.. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:03:51
Will happen suddenly one night... but just hodl... don't sweat the daily price volatility.... We'll see $4,000 before we see $10,000... just fucking hodl.... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:27:37
Just hodling and chillin'... too many weak noobies who do not understand the ups and downs of investments.. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:43:31
This is why we are on our way to $10,000... I know of many many newbies opening accounts on exchanges and just waiting for the great "dip"..... and we're not even talking about the huge financial whales that are starting to get interested... 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:50:46
Just stop making money... you're upsetting the stock fund managers on Personal Finance.. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:33:44
Just hate silicone tits...
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:42:56
Especially Krugman, who said the internet will have no more effect on us than the fax machine... idiot... 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:10:50
Seems like it was not a scam.. she just got nervous and left. If you contact her again she will probably pay you when she receives the BTC.. just my humble thoughts.. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:38:24
That's it.. I'm ripping out all the copper piping in my house and selling it for BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:06:05
Same situation here.. I'm not as smart of many of the geeks here... just sitting on my Trezor and hoping it will all sort itself out in the end.. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:38:02
Facebook is for your Grandparents..
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:27:37
Just hodling and chillin'... too many weak noobies who do not understand the ups and downs of investments.. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:59:47
Don't understand all this trading..... just hodl your BTC and block out all the noise... Ten year time frame..
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:21:40
I'd buy if you accepted BTC..
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:10:30
A big thank you to the Communist Peoples' Republic of China... 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:14:48
Just buy a little every week.... average in, and the hodl forever..
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:52:49
I'm thinking of investing in tulips now.. should I hodl?
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:43:15
Just remember, a dollar from 100 years ago is worth $0.02 in today's money.... that's fiat for you.... 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:49:06
My bank told me this intraweb thing is going nowhere.. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:41:23
Trezor Wallet, and if you are in it to hodl, buy your coins now.. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:33:27
Trezor... easy.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:04:40
Still early days... just accumulate and hodl Bitcoin... going to be a long, but very profitable, journey.. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:07:38
Yes for now they aren't.. but there is an ongoing court case with the IRS and Coinbase. Who do you think is gonna win that one... ?
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:02:38
If anybody thinks that US exchanges like Coinbase etc will not be required to share ALL their past transaction history in the future, they are kidding themselves. Keep accurate records, and pay your taxes = sleep well at night. Just sayin'... 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:54:17
Tulips I tell you... s'all tulips!!!! 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:01:05
Yeah they banned Google and Youtube and looked what happened to them.... oh wait... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:36:51
Yes, worked there for many years in manufacturing. There are no moral standards in China.. Best to be rid of them. Bitcoin will survive and thrive without the commies. Personally I'm enjoying the dip.. shakes out the weak hands, and lets us hodlers accumulate. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:37:24
You're right... Just want to get to the place where I feel secure enough to start spending... 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:34:55
Just long term Capital Gains tax on the profit.. selling price minus cost.. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:50:39
You shouldn't invest in BTC because money does not make you happy.. Being rich is a curse... 
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:37:10
Bloomberg TV now reporting exchanges will be banned in China. This is not FUD.. but Bitcoin is bigger than China. Hodling..
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:41:59
Oh FFS... screw China... let the commies ban it like they did  Google, Facebook, Youtube.... Don't care if there's a huge dip... will buy more.. Hodling for the long term. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:04:30
It's a win-win for me.. either I'll be incredibly rich, or I get to watch McAfee eat his dick on youtube... 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:54:21
How come BTC is still so damn cheap ??? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:56:29
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:31:02
Shake out all the weak hands!! Enjoying the dip. Thanks China..
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:54:04
Once a BTC ETF is approved, GBTC will fall 'cause of the premium you pay when you buy GBTC.. Better to buy BTC directly.
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:18:54
So ban it all China.. the world just doesn't care anymore.. Just like you banned Google, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram etc etc etc.... 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:50:26
I've heard estimates that 20% of the 16,000,000 mined Bitcoiins are already lost.. means there will never be a full 21,000,000 coins out there.. good for us hodlers.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:48:49
And BTC's a bubble........
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:05:33
Sympathy to you friend.. this too shall pass... I just Trezor these days.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:44:25
Smart lads.. I wish them the very best..
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:33:35
The way I see it, in ten years BTC will be either worth $0 or $50,000+..... I like those odds. I've stopped watching the daily price movements, just chillin' and hodling.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:07:47
I recently joined Kraken.com ... excellent customer service... always a live reply within 24 hours.... love Kraken.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:31:22
BTC only.... no shitcoins.... and hodl through all the volatility..
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:08:52
Fantastic website.... enjoyed reading some of the obituaries!!
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:03:16
People don't realize.... the % of folk who own BTC is still tiny... we haven't even started yet... 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:13:17
I think all exchanges should switch to mBTC instead of BTC... too many people tell me they cannot afford to get into BTC.. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:19:17
Yes, I'm just talking about USA based exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:25:39
I agree with your IRA advantage.. good luck anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:05:18
BTC only... rid yourself of all the shitcoins..
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:02:25
Absolutely.. Go ahead and ban it China.. we'll move on. Just hodling..
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:16:56
Just throw your BTG and BCH into that spare change jar..
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:50:43
I have a bad feeling about all these forks... 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:19:24
Go ahead and ban it Putin... like your friend Xi did...
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:34:32

I think she would explain bill in mBTC not BTC....

Man with many birthdays live long..
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:32:06
The more I check BTC price, the more it falls. When I forget to check for a while, price goes up. This is pure science in action.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:00:04
One day in the not too distant future people will be reminiscing about the time you could buy a whole Bitcoin for a mere $5,000.... 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:05:23
I forsee plenty of volatility during the fork, but those of us that simply hodl fast and ignore the noise should be very happy by the new year. There is only one BTC..
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:46:08
Yeah baby yeah!
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:04:58
The re-submission was rejected today. BTC is dipping in response. 2019 I think will see the first ETF.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:32:24
It's called tax evasion.. don't bend down to pick up the soap in the prison shower.. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:53:20
Because whatever is or has been thrown at BTC it has and will survive and thrive.. I avoid all shitcoins and just hodl BTC. Long term..
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:45:56
I think that even if China did ban bitcoin, and they haven't, but even if they did, of course the price would crash for a while, but bitcoin would survive and thrive in the long term.. Bitcoin is unstoppable..
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:08:43
There is only one Bitcoin.... just one.... 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:57:29
If Satoshi's BTC are lost forever, which is a possibility, then there will never be 21 million BTC... good for us hodlers. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:05:16
Will he cut it off first, or is he limber enough to eat his dick in place?? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:07:41
Cuban is most likely going to be running for President in 2020 as a Republican... would shake things up... 
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:34:52
I've averaged in at approx $200, 400, 600, 800, 1800, 2000, 3000, 4000.... Hodling forever.. Those selling during this dip will find it very hard to jump back in once the next run begins. Just buy and hodl.. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:06:38
or the fake news that they are going to ban Facebook, Google and Youtube...
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:02:30
Good riddance you commie bastards...
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:45:45
Create a diversified portfolio. Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Gold and Bitcoin.. you'll do just fine...... 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:05:25

@_date: 2017-10-21 21:48:27
The big money hasn't even started with BTC yet.. imagine if JPM had started investing in BTC a couple of years ago..
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:19:16
I think most members of Congress don't even understand how the Federal Reserve works.. in fact not many people really do. As far as BTC, 90%+ of them have absolutely no idea.. but they do love to expound on the topic..
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:16:24
Just hodl ur BTC through the fork..
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:08:13
Nobody should leave their BTC on Coinbase... ever.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:46:48
Hey, you gotta take some chances in life if you want to make it big.... 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:46:12
Because once a BTC ETF becomes approved, your GBTC is going to drop... why own GBTC when I can own an ETF with a much smaller premium built in? When a BTC ETF is approved, my BTC will continue to rise, so if you want to invest in BTC, invest in BTC itself.. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:49:57
Everything depends on the November fork... and the following few weeks.

Dimon... Wall Street bankster who should be Bubba's cell mate...... How much has he gained since joining JPM?? You don't want to know.. you would not believe it... 
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:27:28
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:40:30
yeah, but worth remembering that's $20k in total over the fiscal year.. not one time $20k transactions. Just talking about Coinbase though..  
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:04:07
Soon be able to afford a Corolla.... yeah BTC!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:51:48
Long ETH not BTC????? So wrong.......
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:11:08
This too shall pass.... 
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:25:00
You have your health.. trust me, that's worth a lot more than 56,351 BTC's..... 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:52:12
I'd like to see people using mBTC more often now the price of BTC is over $6k... 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:45:12
All us hodlers have been there, done that... just learn and hodl..
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:14:45
Of course buy and hodl... 
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:16:25
Beats all that Elliott Wave nonsense....
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:50:15
yeah y'all just shut up while I mop up your coins... 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:14:42
Long live the revolution!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:17:48
If you did not go through an exchange then I wouldn't worry.. I just feel that eventually Coinbase and all exchanges will be forced to disclose all their transaction history. Anyway, you only owe taxes if you sell your Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:20:30
Kraken.com so much better than Coinbase..
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:09:21
I can guarantee you that many of Jamie's JPM minions are buying Bitcoin with their Wall Street earnings.....
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:30:11
I'm just talking about if you sell for $ on a USA based exchange.. all other type of transactions, yes very hard to prove anything.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:28:03

Just have him google the National Debt Clock live.... explain that fiat currencies don't do well holding their value.. ask him to tell you what $10 could buy when he was a kid.. 'nuff said.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:30:55
Great news when a member of the authoritarian corrupt house of Saud attacks BTC.. a feudal bunch of 14th century goat herders who got lucky. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:33:19
I read somewhere that maybe 20% of the issued Bitcoins have already been lost... good news for hodlers... means the 21 million cap is actually smaller..
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:36:17
Happened to me.. just transfer your coins to a hard wallet like Trezor.
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:19:20
Will not be approved until 2019 so there will be some disappointment next month..
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:23:37
I think it's a great idea.. also suggest ripping all your plumbing out and selling the copper piping to invest in more BTC. Also selling her body??
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:40:45
Just hodl and keep buying..
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:48:36
Like most people I discuss this with, I am just going to sit tight and hodl my BTC in a wallet until the smoke clears in a few months..
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:39:42
No bitcoin for you!
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:07:17
Fck Coinbase.... get your coins outta Coinbase!!! Worst support I have ever experienced.. Kraken is the only exchange I would trust.
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:02:59
No. It was re-submitted and today rejected.

I simply cannot believe that in this day and age, Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown... I mean wtf... there's a  lot we don't know.... 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:08:43
Just ban it China.. we're over you.
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:05:48
I believe it will be 2019... all these people imagining it's this August.... no way. Prepare for a small dip when the news gets out..
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:51:05
We are still in the very early days.. the apps and wallets that will enable Average Joe to use BTC daily are yet to come.. I remember the internet in the early '90's.... 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:42:11
We need more BTC heros like this.. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:41:02
Actually not.. I experienced Coinbase and waited over six months for support. Switched to Kraken and have never had to wait more than 24 hours.. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 02:19:12
But I thought BTC was dead ?
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:58:36
I would make an immediate police report. Sorry to hear about your situation.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:07:59
They just don't get the fact that 99% of Bitcoiners are not dark web criminals looking to launder... unlike those Wall Street banksters with their Cayman Island and Panamanian off shore fiat bank accounts.... 
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:15:48
I'd say it's a very sound investment.. double or triple within 24 hours. Sounds like a win-win to me. Let me know how you get on.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:29:11
Yeah plummeting over $8,000..
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:29:57
Kraken... the best. Customer service top class..
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:40:51
There is no one as good as Andreas at explaining BTC....
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:03:55
It's just Natural Selection in action.... if someone does not have the intelligence to do a bit of research before investing in cryptos... 
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:23:00
There are certain celebrities that I have absolutely no idea how they got where they are.... Kim Kardashian is one... Whoopie Goldberg.. Ellen Degeneris... etc etc... But hey, any BTC promotion is good I guess... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:17:14
Just pay your taxes.. Recently submitted a revised tax return for 2016, to include some BTC gains I failed to include... sleep better at night now..

Relax people... your children and grandchildren will pay all this back.. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:40:30
Or tattoo the seed on your body perhaps?? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:50:29

@_date: 2018-07-06 16:05:09
Natural Selection, in action...
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:59:38
Yes, but manipulation could be done with any stock, financial instrument or commodity if you had the money.
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:36:47
I do it all the time, ask if they accept BTC.. know they don't, but just spreading the gospel..
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:12:05
6k!!!!??? Can someone explain why this is so damn cheap?
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:28:23

The only way for the Fed to get out of the $20,000,000,000,000 debt we have accrued is to inflate ourselves out of it.. so if you think fiat loses value over time, just wait.. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:41:43
Welcome back little guy!!!!!! We missed you..
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:46:54
ok now aim for the 21 club... but do it quick before $100k...
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:28:50
Excellent stuff.... gives me a lot of confidence..
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:11:34
I watched it too.. I still get the feeling that a lot of the other commentators still do not really understand blockchain tech. But, yes we are starting to get much better coverage.
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:12:52
With all the lost BTC there are what.. probably only 16 million BTC in existence at the moment? Go ahead and short Soros.. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:18:58
I'll contribute a few Satoshis...
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:17:50
It's a known fact that blockchain addles a women's brain and causes female neurosis. Now get back in the kitchen and make me a sandwich.. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:46:06
In a few years time folks will be amazed that you could have picked up a full BTC under $10k back in 2018... 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:56:20
It's all good... the more people involved in crypto the better.. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:58:05
Classic bike... 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:38:23
Yea nup.. I meant after all BTC are mined.. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:26:39
This time next year reddit will be full of the moaners complaining about why they didn't buy more when it was $6k+.... 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:06:31
If 2X fails..

Oh no, not that financial hub of the world Pakistan????
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:08:51
So sell them, bring it on and get it over with.... faster it happens the faster we pass $20k... 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:04:39
Why the hell would you sell at 8.9k.... ? And there's the 30% short-term gain tax... 
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:10:48
I miss the little roller coaster guy...
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:15:09
Just want my little roller coaster guy to come back....

Zero... no normal country wants to be left behind..

No security escort??
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:11:37
A self storage unit is a good idea, you will need at least a 10 x 20 unit, with shelving. Good luck to you and welcome to the BTC club.. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:41:28
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:15:36
Please everybody... always use the name BCash... I hate to see out beloved Bitcoin bastardized..... 
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:51:55
To wake up every day and see that view.... nice life. Well done mon ami..
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:50:25
and yet they continually roll out Paul Krugman on places like CNBC pontificating his "expert" financial thoughts..... Thank God he thinks BTC is going nowhere..... 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:43:53
All I can say about Coinbase is their customer support is the worse I have ever encountered... it's hopeless. Moved to Kraken, and they respond and fix any issues within 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:32:25
This move will eventually enable BTC ETF's (2018 or 2019) which will bring in a huge amount of interest and $$$$$$..... The day the first ETF is launched, BTC will rocket..
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:55:58
welcome back lil' fella !!
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:11:16
Write on piece of paper and swallow..
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:56:46
So obviously a scam from the start... why bother..
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:16:10
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:35:35
Fuck Coinbase... use Kraken.com.
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:21:37
But I thought criminals only used Bitcoin?

"Asking for a friend"....

I love the smell of burning shorts in the morning..
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:23:04
Hope we hit 5k...I will be buying.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:42:10
Don't understand you traders ..trying to time the market...very few people can do it. Just damn well hodl if you wanna get BTC rich.. Hodlin since 2015..
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:51:59
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:39:39
Work for fiat...and then invest in the future..
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:38:22
Damn.. do not buy BTC.. we don't want you.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:03:15
The only store of value based on pure math..
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:04:49
Son...? I hereby disown you..
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:35:25
Doesn't matter..still not selling at 28k...
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:42:50
But I lost my seed Your Honor...
@_date: 2019-05-18 12:54:14
All good for the rest of us hodlers..
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:56:18
Once you've created your seed.. double check it, before adding funds.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:42:19
Like quantitative easing is not manipulation?
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:49:51
Very grateful.... thank you
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:04:32
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:41:30
Take balls of steel, but if it does reach 10k I'm still hodling..
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:59:11
Completely agree..
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:52:41
Sell sell sell...I'll buy and hodl..
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:01:29
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:41:57
Great post. I too have been hodling since 2015..you just need patience and belief to hang on during the sometimes massive dips. I am convinced that in ten years we shall be very happy. We are still at the beginning.. but it takes balls of steel..
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:40:59
Yes... made in jest..
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:02:59
It's all good...
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:43:31
Don't understand u traders..been hodlin' since 2015..gotta think long...
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:29:41
This is a long-term game. Been in BTC since 2015 and watched these kind of dips. Trying to time the market is a mugs game.. not many people can do it well. Just hodl and wait.. that's my advice, for what it's worth..
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:42:02
Almost funny.. as they try to save fiat... Once the shit hits the fan, you'd better be hodlin' a few BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:38:40
Relax people... this is good...
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:02:28
I mean out of the 21 mil.at the end of the day there will only be 17 mil   BTC..I know many who have lost their BTC in the early days
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:44:26
Excellent piece..
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:40:43
Yes...It was made in jest..
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:56:28
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:29:25
Great to see this. Wish I could be there..
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:35:20
You have to find me first...
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:39:57
Well worth checking this out..
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:51:48
Sell at $100k????? Nah.....
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:45:58
$250k.. 2029 is a long way away...
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:57:03
I get them...straight to trash..
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:36:01
Yes but what if one day we are able to mine asteroids..?? Who knows just how many BTC could be up there..?
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:05:37
Mugs game...just hodl for the next few years..
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:01:46
But I thought criminals only used BTC??????
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:40:16
Hodl man hodl..
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:57:55
They never seem to report it when BTC is rising...
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:43:09
Andrea's Antonopolis videos in YouTube to start..then open an account on kraken.com..then buy yourself a Trezor. Job done..
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:36:01
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:14:55
Retired International Man of Mystery here..and hodlin' for the next ten years..
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:16:56
Just hodl and keep dollar cost averaging in. Five years, $50k minimum, I truly believe. Personally I love the drops, and the critics... the tulips and beanie baby comments... keep 'em coming I say. And as for that Congressman... love it..
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:21:33
More like 17,000,000....not 21.000.000....so many have been lost.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:09:32
Absolutely what I have been saying to myself since 2015.... within ten years it will either be $0 or $250k min.. if you can accept that, you sleep better..
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:49:28
Ask Buffet about his Kraft Heinz investment..
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:06:36
Yes they're mine. I'm hodling..
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:36:22
It's call a Trezor. Use one..
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:37:28
I'm 61 and a BTC maximalist.. get off my damn lawn!
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:53:12
Also..as for using BTC for Money Laundering...just ask some of the big banks which have been fined billions of dollars..... oh wait..that was fiat..
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:14:48
Hodlin' until death..
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:00:45
Only the holders will survive...
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:53:54
Coinbase banned me too with no explanation..I followed all the rules.. struggled for months to get a response..moved to Kraken.com who always reply within 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:33:47
Hodle man... until the end.... $0 or $250,000... that's my belief, and I'm prepared to take the gamble..
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:22:29
Do u think BTC will rise in price ?
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:41:10
Yes... made in jest..
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:37:06
Trezor One...
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:37:42
Nice to see a lot of old hands helping out the newbies.... welcome aboard!
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:41:10
Happy days..happy days....
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:34:58
Magic internet money..
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:31:52
Yes I did Coinbase..but have never experienced such poor customer support. Kraken always reply within 24 hours and solve any issues.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:31:40
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:29:47
After Coinbase experiences, Kraken is the best. Customer support ALWAYS gets back to you.. can't say enough good things about Kraken. I wish them well...
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:32:20
Don't believe it until I see the memes..
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:23:19
RIP bitcoin....oh wait..?
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:32:38
Andreas.. you are a God to me...
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:55:08
ya.... tough time for believers... but the thing that gives me great hope is the number of incredibly smart young people working on BTC development... folks much smarter than me.. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:31:55
I personally do my bit by asking every retailer and service provider if they accept BTC.. even if I know they don't.. it's all about getting the name out there..
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:06:05
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:39:38
hodling.. never sell..
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:39:13
Just increase ur DCA amount...and for God's sake hodl!!!
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:43:34
Now I'm confused...criminals using cash????
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:37:20
Screw the commies... just buy BTC and hodl..
