Nobody has to be selling bitcoin for the price to drop.  Just like physical gold, the price can be controlled by the derivatives.  I don't think anybody has been dumping gold, but the big players (including the fed) can dump paper gold and the price of physical gold will follow.  I am guessing the same thing is happening with bitcoin since bitcoin futures are now traded on Cboe.  It will get worse when there are more ETFs, options on ETFs, etc.

If you google "coinbase wire transfer" you will see a lot of people have had problems getting their money to their accounts in a timely manner.  I would just use your checking account and wait the 5 days for it to show up.  I have a $7500/ week deposit limit, not sure about you.

Which few weeks was that?  I guess if you had a $100K in BTC a month ago.  Nice car, can't tell what year.

You can be assured that all the big players on Wall Street have been laundering their QE money the best they can.  Crypto is perfect for them to play their evil games.

Banks don't even have to bother to print money.  They just loan it into creation.  Then you pay them back with real money that you earned.

The fork in August that created bitcoin cash.  People that had bitcoin on coinbase back then still have not been given their free bitcoin cash.  They are going to start wanting it pretty soon.

FOCUS ON FUNDS A Violent Unwinding: Volatility Spikes, Kills One ETN
ByCrystal Kim Updated Feb. 6, 2018 11:28 a.m. ET
 
Update: NYSE Arca will resume trading of the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF at 11:35 AM ET.
The short volatility trade was a wreck to behold. As stocks gave back all the year’s gains in a single day, volatility reared its head with the CBOE Volatility Index spiking up 95% to 37 by the close. Needless to say inverse volatility products VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV) and ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) went down in flames.
The combined net asset value of these two products cratered to about $150 million from $3 billion. Peter Boockvar CIO of Bleakley Advisory Group, who estimated the short-vol trade was in the $1.5 trillion range, mused: “Yesterday was the day the short volatility trade died. Bye-bye, Miss American Pie".
That $1.5 trillion bubble in the inverse VIX trade makes the $367 billion market cap of crypto look kinda small.

Are you from the future?  What date is it today?
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:09:11
Up until two days ago there was almost $2 trillion betting on  inverse volatility (XIV, for one).  That is 3X as much as the total marketcap for cryptos.  Is that systemic risk OK since it was created by Wall Street?  (I would love to hear his answer to that)

It is nice to give money away but the IRS will still want their cut on what you give away, if it has not been taxed yet.  Do you think they would miss something that obvious?

Sorry, should have read your OP more carefully.  Good job on HODLing for 60X returns and keeping your coins safe.

You will be a busy person.  Dawnpatrol made a plug for a project that will get rid of exchanges.  That is the future of crypto, imo.  Any project that tries to do that will get my attention.  I appreciate people who give awareness to projects, especially in the topic of the discussion.

Why do they call them ATMs?  If you don't walk away with a bunch of paper money, it is not a ATM.

Taxes are just part of the game that makes fiat money appear valuable.

If I was to pay cash for BTC under the table, I would want about a 25% discount.  The risk for the buyer will be that he has no proof of a cost basis when he sells the BTC, if that matters.

When I bought with my checking account, the ETH or BTC was available instantly.  They were also excellent when it came to fiat withdrawals. So, it is not everyone that has problems.

There is already the Grayscale BTC fund, GBTC? , am not really sure why they got approved and the ETF is having problems getting approved.  Wall Street infestation of BTC is inevitable, it sucks.

I highly doubt any gold trader will report anything to the IRS.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:02:57
I guess I believe you, since I have no experience with that, but I would buy BTC from an ATM if the markup is not more than about 10%.  I would like to have a separate wallet that is not tied to a KYC exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:10:54
Banks only report cash deposits, usually only those over $10K.  The exchange which cashes out your BTC for cash has their own criteria for reporting to the IRS in a Form 1099.  Think about it, banks are not going to notify the IRS every time somebody gets a check deposit in their account from selling a car, motorcycle, boat, or other property.  Or every time somebody transfers money from their 401K or IRA to their checking account.

When I was in college we were taught the rule of 72.  Meaning you start with 72 and divide by the interest rate and it will tell you how long it will take to double your money.  This was in the early 80s when a money market fund paid 7-8%.  72 / 7.5 meant you double your money in a safe investment in less than 10 years.   Try that calculation now, and you can see how worthless money has become.  If it was worth something, you would charge something to borrow it.
And any professor that laughs at a student's answer is a dick.

The ETF will not be available to retail investors, only to institutions.  (whatever that means).  Each share will represent the price of 25 BTC.  If groups of people with unlimited money started buying this ETF, it will go parabolic.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:09:01
It is always good to have "dry powder" (funds available) to take advantage of situations like this.  No guarantee that it won't go lower, but at least you can buy a dip.  The only semi-good thing about Coinbase is that you can buy BTC instantly (at about $100/BTC over market currently) even though you can't move it for a while.

Why would you assume they are being used to buy drugs?  I would think the cash they are putting in the machine would be better for that.  I would guess those BTC buyers are just people that want to buy their BTC anonymously,  or maybe had bad experiences at exchanges.

Have never moved money from country to country.  It sucks that it seems to be more and more difficult to do.  It seems that you are assumed to be a criminal unless you can prove otherwise.  Have read horror stories of people traveling with semi-large amounts of cash on overseas flights and having it all confiscated.  I wonder if the 1% have this problem?
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:52:33
Well you chose the  best coin to start with.  Dollar cost average (DCA) with bitcoin and you will be ok.  I don't know your location, but if in USA, don't mess with alt coins, keep it simple- straight buys of BTC, no selling.  Tax implications are complicated if you start trading between coins.  (My opinion based on almost two years in crypto)
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:10:46
They are not interested in it as a currency, they want to be in it as a hedge against everything else.  They will just create paper bitcoin based on options/futures and sell that as buying bitcoin.  Just like they did with gold and silver.  Am hoping they don't kill bitcoin like they did precious metals.
