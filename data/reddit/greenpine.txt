Not a very good lesson to learn, or spread to others... 
You would have made much more if you spent your mining costs on buying bitcoin directly. Especially now, when the GPU mining era is long gone.

Attacked? No, replaced.

@_date: 2012-08-17 12:16:07
Please explain what you mean by "near-real price". 
@_date: 2012-06-19 17:18:52
Agreed. Doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2012-06-25 20:54:25
Nope, xrandr's translation is better.  Italian and English have different word orders.
@_date: 2012-11-20 17:58:17
"inflation"? Did you mean money growth? 
@_date: 2012-10-26 23:34:23
Boy, do I hate this kind of word sewage. Don't have anything substantial to say? So don't.
@_date: 2012-12-29 21:29:48
What were the predictions for 2012? Was there such a post on Would be interesting to look at it in retrospect.
@_date: 2012-08-30 18:30:04
Name a currency that is not made up... :)
@_date: 2012-09-23 08:20:55
Must be one helluva big company... Their network power must be able to withstand mining attacks from hacker bot nets.
@_date: 2012-08-17 07:37:44
Makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up.
Too bad though, I was looking forward to total humiliation when the bitcoin entry won the whole shebang.
@_date: 2012-12-29 21:24:56
Pretty interesting, but how is it related to Bitcoin? 
(I didn't watch the whole thing.)
@_date: 2012-08-06 19:51:02
Try the search engine elgoog.
@_date: 2012-09-12 20:21:28
I am planning to hold the bitcoin I own now for 5-10 years. They are part of my retirement plan!

I think a "savings based" economy would make it more evident for businesses that organic growth in small iterations is indeed something really good. Today, too many businesses take too big "leaps of faith" before they know their business plan is viable. If you make progress in small enough iterations, you will not need dangerously big initial loans. (I recently read the excellent book [Lean Startup]( which covers this topic very well)
@_date: 2012-08-06 20:45:45
Ok, now try reading Obecalp backwards... 
(I didn't even know "Elgoog" actually existed, was just trying to be half as funny as funny guy qarl.)

One thousand. /In it for the long run.
@_date: 2012-08-11 12:59:01
Since he talked about raising one million new bitcoin users in 2012, I've heard him mention bitcoin like twice. Ask him about that.
@_date: 2012-06-19 17:43:20
Smells fishy. Email addresses to bitcoin users is what scammers are looking for.

"Most people will not adopt Bitcoin until it is presented to them from the top."
This. Well said. Never thought of it that way, but I'm sure it's true. Pretty sad though.
@_date: 2012-09-23 12:10:52
Well, consider this: The bitcoin network is today by far the world's most powerful network of computer power. If it wasn't, it could and would be outpowered by malicious networks/ bot nets, assembled by bad guys.
@_date: 2012-06-25 03:59:29
Let's do it!
@_date: 2012-09-13 17:33:10
Diversification is boring. Putting all the eggs in one basket makes me feel more alive. I may be dumb, but I'm having more fun! Also, if you really believe in something you should go 'all in'.
@_date: 2012-07-03 19:24:54
Oh boy. That's funny...
@_date: 2012-09-13 09:17:50
He, I'm like 80%. What does that make me?
@_date: 2012-08-17 13:21:36
Ok, but I mean the notion of a "real" price. Nothing else than supply and demand (speculation) determines the price of bitcoins. 
So "the real price" is always -- at any given moment -- exactly the same as "the price". See what I mean? 
@_date: 2012-10-24 19:57:18
If this comment isn't an inside job, the pope doesn't have a funny looking hat.

I did get that error message once. Must be a bug though,  BTC still works for me.

"The Nakamoto"!
@_date: 2013-01-30 16:28:06
Loved this comment: 
"Bitcoin is constrained by mathematics like gold is constrained by physics. Both are products of, and limited in volume by, the laws of nature. So why are we allowing ourselves to be screwed by the arbitrary creation of fiat, whose sole purpose seems to be to transfer wealth to the fiat creators and their buddies?"
@_date: 2013-02-22 05:17:00
You are right of course. But for now I get a lot of happiness from just imagining the day I can tell her we are millionaires...
If I told her now, she would freak out and convince me to sell it all. But I'm in it for the long run!
@_date: 2013-01-23 19:19:41
Hi. Hope you find a buyer for your domain!
@_date: 2013-02-22 05:34:30
I like this. And I have some developing skills.
 I would worry about server uptime though. Could use multiple servers, I guess.
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:03:47
Thanks. Thing is though, I haven't told my family about my little bitcoin adventure... They can only know when I die or when I choose to tell them. 
I guess I could get a secret safety deposit box, but I would worry about my wife finding an invoice or something in the mail! 
@_date: 2013-02-27 21:21:55
Duh... The value of gold has very little to do with its ability to conduct electricity. It amazes me that a guy like that even mentions this in a  discussion about mediums of exchange.
@_date: 2013-01-21 05:03:59
Inflation rate is not the right term here, you are talking about money growth. Higher inflation rate may be the result of faster money growth, but not always.
@_date: 2013-02-21 15:32:22
Or simply 1 Satoshi = 1000 Nakamotos :)
@_date: 2013-01-21 06:26:27
Yes, and on the same page: 
"Originally the term "inflation" was used to refer only to monetary inflation, whereas in present usage it usually refers to price inflation". 
I guess it's advisable to point out which one is referred to. (Which was not done here, either by OP or myself)
@_date: 2013-02-20 16:28:04
That last sentence. Difficult to be more wrong than that.
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:17:15
Yes, I know. But that would force me to trust a website. This is also why I don't think the idea with the delay site is good enough.
@_date: 2013-02-22 23:40:36
Guess you're right. I think what we early adopters have in common is that we have - before this journey started - been given a series of opportunities that have provided us with the knowledge and experience needed to realize that this is something that will actually work. Those opportunities have been given to us partly by chance, partly by interest but most importantly by having an open mind. 
These economists have not been given these opportunities and their minds are probably far from open enough.

"Pubic offering": Freudian slip?
