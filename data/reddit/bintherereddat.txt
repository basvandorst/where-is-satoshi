This is why vertcoin is a compelling alternative

Is this something you do regularly?  I'm looking to buy some bitcoin but I would consider litecoin if its easily converted

When a single group (or groups) are mining all future coins and can effectively manipulate price.  These groups will essentially become banks which defeats the purpose of bitcoin.

ATM's will make acquiring bitcoin easier.  I'm truthfully less concerned with young peoples desires, and more about how to fight decentralization when all future coins are being mined by select groups with the capital to set up ASIC mining factories.  I invest in bitcoin, I don't think it will be an issue for a while (if you're not mining), I'm just concerned for whoever I leave my bitcoin to in the will.

You're right I don't really understand it.  I was thinking further into the future, where one group holds most of the coins in circulation.  Wouldn't they be able to manipulate price by increasing/decreasing supply on exchanges?

You can only mine on generic CPUs and GPUs.  It prevents these big warehouses with expensive hardware (ASICs) from controlling most of the future coins.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:37:36
Exactly

Couldn't you buy and island from another country and make the official currency bitcoin?  Offer people to swap out their monopoly money when they get there.  You could probably wait for Nick Cage to make another blockblust and buy his for pennies on the dollar.

I was teasing.  Warren made big money in the early days of stock trading.      No way he made 19.5 tho
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:00:26
He made his money in the 1800s
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:53:31
I see they have full coins, is it possible to buy partial bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:09:14
Good stuff, sir
@_date: 2014-03-15 14:09:26
I am interested in hearing total % sales increase since these businesses adopted bitcoin.   
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:52:58
Same thing happened to me

He correctly predicted many events including the real estate collapse in 08.  He is a complete asshole tho

Northern Canada is cheap and should be a hot tourist spot in 50-100
@_date: 2015-08-08 14:11:45
Yeah they literally just launched in 5 cities near me a few weeks ago.   Bitcoin won't make them profitable. - time will

Haha, thank you

Nope.  I was looking for solutions and found quite a few posts on reddit asking for password help.   It may come across spammy, but it wasn't intentional and I am in no way affiliated with the company (you can check my post history, haven't been involved in crypto in years).  Just sharing a positive story - he could have walked away with my coin.
