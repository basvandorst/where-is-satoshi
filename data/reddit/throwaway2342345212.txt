That isn't exactly what PGP said -- he said BFX buying their own tokens would surely be a conflict of interest and they wouldn't do such a thing -- but that doesn't stop an individual like a large holding principle in the company or a subsidery company from trading them -- I have gotten to know PGP well over the years from both TS and in person conversations and he is very careful with his words.
Of course BFX itself isn't trading their own tokens but you have to listen to what he doesn't say

Actually I **do** agree with you however there is still a lot of people that think BFX as company itself lost coins in the hack but that is incorrect -- it was the customers funds that were stolen. That does **not** mean they aren't liable but I think they actually will ring fence the losses on those customers and not offer monetary compensation because their brand equity has already cratered -- it isn't worth it to BFX to move the haircut from say 60% to 40% and have little to no capital to try and function going forward -- again let me reiterate that I don't think that is right of them to do as their negligence directly caused the losses to customers but I think they are going to put that capital to work in the operations post hack rather than here if that makes sense. We are all traders here and from a cost benefit on their brand it makes more sense to take the heat of the haircut and use that capital elsewhere.

I am pretty sure anyone can go on  and hear what the higher ups have to say themselves before it is latter leaked on to reddit, I think it is more that reddit is always going to be slower than live chat

They still posted all the updates on their website there were just continuing discussions in and around those updates that didn't have a formal structure -- you can't really suggest they have a live dialogue or blog on their website with comments 1) it would be a nightmare to moderate and 2) they very well would just silence their critics -- so with that said the 3rd party system allows for the better transmittion of raw information even if some older people don't like it because it is all prepackaged like what happens in MSM

If the platform was fully functioning without glitches and hiccups that cost people money (not just the hack) then I would be inclined to agree with you however that is simply not the case
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:45:41
Phil and Zane both say very inaccurate things and dance around questions though so I think it is fair for those posts to come -- and still we have nothing transparent on how the 36% calculations were arrived at and what BFX contributed (if any) from it's coffers to bring that value to the 36% -- it is just more and more deflection that bfxtokens and some settlement costs are twisted by Zane into "BFX is providing full resources to compensate customers" oh wait except the operating and legal fund yet still tell us what the dollar figure on those supposed resources are

BTCVIX here -- I know we have sparred in the past but these are  all great questions I would like the answers to as well -- hope you didn't have any or much funds on BFX

Lets get something straight -- he isn't there to be "friends" with you and chummy only so far as that pads his pockets and helps his business -- if you don't see that plain as day you are a fool. I think it just bad taste for him to resume his same habits when the platform still isn't functioning at a level to instill confidence going forward

Is that you MAbtc -- and I have met Giancarlo in person and can confirm he is dumb as rocks
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:19:01
yeah man -- I have been going over again and again what I asked Zane in that interview and now his recent post on the contributions and he is using a deflection and co-opting technique to try and answer the question broadly when we are getting very **very** specific. 
Essentially he is balling together the fact that BFX is offering shares/tokens in the company and a near trivial amount (given the context of the hack) of trade balance settlement costs into what Zane wants us to associate those with -- here is his own phrase of trying to say the aforementioned points are the contribution : "...we have committed all of the company’s reserves to compensate customers"
I have lost all respect for Zane having known and worked with him a lot in the early OKC futures days -- he knows what we are asking but he is trying to paint this picture differently. I am glad people have really latched onto this question and the wheels are falling off as he flails around like an idiot 
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:45:55
Most important press release in the history of BFX and in Zane's career and somehow he and everyone that reviewed it somehow forgot to include what assets BFX the company was using to offset losses ? I just don't believe it
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:40:07
Game over
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:23:39
yeah I agree

In bitcoin CP risk trumps vol risk so it is the lesser of the two evils to manage -- in fact the more vol even with leverage being constant means the less you need on exchange to incur meaningful gains -- imo all the conventional wisdom surrounding the "don't use leverage" camp has been smashed and destroyed in the crypto trading world with all the CP events

It is bizarre to have a c-level executive of an exchange drinking in the presence of their customers who just got fleeced not 24hours after re-launching trading after a $70million hack
I am sure it was a hard week but that seems a bit bold
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:07:33
I have had far more converations in public, private, and in person with both Phil and Giancarlo than you have so I have quite some depth as the character and motivations of these individuals. I don't blame anyone for liking their story times but that shouldn't cloud your view of the business incentives at work
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:48:41
After witnessing the level of incompetence in this man I am amazed he was even able to understand piracy back then
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:41:57
Zane you aren't going to win this battle as on the voice interview you see the settlement of trades and the offering of BFX IOU token as BFX offering reserves to help customers. **We want to know a specific amount that BFX  contributed to reduce the haircut to the 36% number**. Let me give you an example of how it would look and be said explicitly: BFX contributed $10million from it's reseves and lowered the haircut from 42% to 36% . You are out of gas trying to ball this all together that you can count trade settlement and bfx tokens in this discussion
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:58:20
So outside of settlement of positions and shares of IOU the company used no assets of their own to offset some of the haircut percentage correct ?

Are you offering a period where the order book will be open and orders can be placed but no trades will occur before matching begins ? and will that be just prior to 16:00UTC or begin at 16:00UTC ? 
@_date: 2016-08-18 04:24:09
BTCVIX here -- yeah I pushed Zane very hard when the initial announcement surrounding the haircut was posted and he came on TeamSpeak to answer questions -- specifically I was very keen on getting him to tell us the breakdown of loses from BFX proper and he kept deflecting and trying to co-opt the argument that BFX was very much so contributing resources as with some trade balance settlement and issuing stock to customers (the bfxtoken). I think he thinks that if he says that over and over again that we are going to take that as BFX contributing but we all want to know what BFX proper contributed (if any) to arrive at that 36% haircut number. Here is the recording for those that haven't heard it where he gets asked these questions 
Also since I went on TeamSpeak and called Zane out about this he has not responded to any of my messages on WeChat since which is quite sad because I had a long time relationship with him dating back when he first started at OKcoin and launched futures on .com
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:57:37
but on the interview that isn't what Zane said -- that is my entire point as has become a PR failure -- if you are going to show that you as a company contributed to reduce the haircut then SHOW IT -- if they didn't contribute to reduce the haircut then they need to say that as well even if it is a bitter pill to swallow -- what they do or don't have at this point no longer matters

Here is where it gets really juicy 
@_date: 2015-09-16 23:38:09
no I believe that has very little to do with. As I stated in the post I believe this is directly tied to their p2p swap market that CFTC has oversight over. This sums it up best:

From mod: 
Well the key is who sent it at the CFTC: A lawyer from the division of enforcement. It didn't come from Market Oversight, Swap Dealer &amp; Intermediary Oversight, or Clearing &amp; Risk. It came from Enforcement. Those are the guys who investigate and punish. Just look up "CFTC Civil Enforcement Action" and you'll be treated to a bit of what the Enforcement division does at the CFTC.
