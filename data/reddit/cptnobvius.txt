It wouldn't be much of a problem when the subsidy falls if we had very big blocks and a huge amount of transactions to pay fees.  If we have 1MB blocks then you are right there is no possible way to subsidize mining when the reward drops.  Also as you said people will abandon Bitcoin for legacy systems yet again, exactly what the establishment wants.  No wonder it seems there are some corrupted devs and forum mods moving Bitcoin in the wrong direction, because the establishment benefits from small blocks.

Yeah and the worrying thing is during the spam attack they were not using dynamic fees, so users could just increase fees a tiny bit and were not affected.  Natural full blocks means that people are willing and incentivized to compete with higher fees.  So fees will need to increase enough to where transactions stay constant as Bitcoin tries to grow but can't.  I can't think this is good.

Its just the beginning though.  I think we are reaching capacity and as more users come on fees can only go up if we want transactions to stay constant.  Imagine if there is only allowed a certain amount of gasoline to be used each day which is far less than the demand of humans.  As human populations and economies grew they would bid and bid for gasoline until the price skyrocketed to astronomical levels.  I mean is anybody honestly refuting the idea that fees are going to rise to much higher levels?  What kind of logic is being used?  I noticed this submission got downvoted hard, interesting nobody seems to care about this.  Maybe they will get smacked in the face by reality soon.
