BitPay's new pricing model offers free payment processing, forever. BitPay's basic service package will remain free for merchants that do not require additional account services to activate their bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:51:15
All 1%/unlimited and $30/month plans will automatically convert to our basic plan model, which is free.

Thank you! That's part of what we're doing here. We're trying to eliminate barriers to entry. Processing fees should not make or break a merchant's decision to embrace Bitcoin.

Just to be clear, we joined the foundation because we support Bitcoin as well as the open source development of the platform.
We want merchants to accept bitcoin and providing the option of converting to fiat this early in bitcoin's development helps to gain merchant confidence. We support the platform 100% and are doing everything we can to help businesses accept it!

Correct. Magento Go is their SaaS hosted version.  For a great SaaS cart solution I would recommend Shopify or 3dcart or foxycart, all of which support BitPay internally.

the payment protocol (BIP70-73) will greatly help this.  not only does it abstract away the raw bitcoin address, but it provides a type of https for bitcoin, so the users wallet knows exactly who they are paying to (via an SSL signed payment request).

The Business and Enterprise merchants often require additional account services, such as custom integrations and designated account managers. BitPay's basic service package will remain free for merchants that do not need those services.

Yes! 
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:32:18
As a payment service provider, we collect only the information needed to process payments for our merchants — in most cases, that is simply an order identifier and price. Please feel free to see our [Privacy Policy]( for any additional information on this.

David at first we will not disclose the private keys, so that we can get a tight handle on the security.  this is not a bitbill, but something to be redeemed at our site for now.  Eventually we can open up the redemption in an API to authorized wallet developers.  one step at a time though :)

welcome 3dprintguy!  glad to have you on board
@_date: 2011-11-13 17:49:01
since bitcoins are Cash, buying them with PayPal or a credit card is like getting a cash advance.  There are major risks for the seller!  if the PayPal account or credit card is fraudulent, the seller loses the payment, and also loses the cash they sent.  So the safest way is to trade cash for bitcoins.  
@_date: 2011-10-29 00:14:25
 and  - I'm curious how your clients typically pay you now through WHMCS?  They have like 100 different billing plugins.
@_date: 2011-10-29 02:30:32
Yes, the customer pays with bitcoins, but we can immediately sell them for USD.  We run a batch every night (like Visa/MC) and send a direct deposit in USD to your bank account the next day.  So you have no exchange rate risk at all.  Bit-Pay assumes the risk for 15 minutes max.
You bring up a very good point, so perhaps we need to promote this a little differently.  "Let customers pay bitcoins, you get dollars" or something like that.  Thanks for the feedback.

we allow each merchant to choose if they want to accept the payment instantly, after 1 confirmation, or after 6 confirmations.  Merchants can actually choose this on a per-invoice basis.  At this time, the merchant's choice for risk/speed is not shown on the invoice, but that is a good suggestion.

2 factor authentication is important for a wallet.  it does not really apply to merchant services. you can easily run any merchant service with 0-factor authentication, just an open web page.  We added it anyway, but it is not necessary for a merchant service that just pushes money out to a set destination every time.

yes, although I think the gift cards are in fixed amounts like $20, $50, $100.

We are having a webinar to introduce and explain this to as many of the existing 3dcart merchants that would like to learn.

she left out the second half of my sentence, which said that there's a 20% chance it could be worth 100x-1000x what it is today.

I should add that these magazines will be Shipped from Amazon (in Tennessee) and should provide a much quicker and more reliable delivery than from the Romanian postal service we have been using.  If this trial with Amazon works out well, we will use them for every issue going forward.

I agree. If I am elected with you, this needs to be our first task at hand.

Mt Gox is not a tradeable market for us at this time.  We cannot sell there, so we cannot use their rates.
@_date: 2013-05-16 13:44:26
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:42:55
yep Eric, you helped us get this account.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:51:25
yishan, we solved this problem back in July 2011 when bitpay launched.  we guarantee all exchange rates and provide gross/net/fees reporting in the merchants local currency, so it is very easy to reconcile.  
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:42:02
keep rocking guys!
@_date: 2013-07-13 04:42:25
Hey that's my BFL Single!
@_date: 2013-01-28 16:37:08
yes and yes
@_date: 2013-06-12 11:04:12
Thanks for the positive feedback!
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:39:20
glad to have you!
@_date: 2013-03-24 07:30:39
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:51:46
yep, send them to  :)
@_date: 2013-09-04 00:03:39
Gyft uses BitPay for rates, and BitPay uses the highest BID prices from multiple exchanges with 0 commission.  So you will always get a better price by spending your bitcoins than selling them.

You'll be happy in March when we resume Romanian mailing for your country.  Shipping from UK costs too much unless we ship 5+ in one box
@_date: 2013-07-19 23:59:41
perhaps, but the bank would not see that.  you get a daily direct deposit from BitPay, which I imagine is also joined by a daily direct deposit from PayPal and whoever your credit card processor is (which may also be PayPal).  The bank has full visibility into the funds flows in and out of your bank account.  I am sure you will have no problem taking your business elsewhere.  I would try Wells Fargo Bank.

BitPay has a much more robust system with more pre-built modules for various ecommerce platforms.  If you have any questions just contact us :)   
@_date: 2013-08-16 00:54:45
 hands down!
@_date: 2013-09-19 20:10:24
No, the shopping cart handles tax calculations (Magento, 3dcart, opencart, etc).
@_date: 2013-08-21 18:41:36
that's an issue with bitcoin-qt.  it can't get a lock on the directory if its already running.  if its not running, then its likely not caught up and not able to send transactions anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:26:29
we are happy to have LibreOffice as a client.  great software!
@_date: 2013-08-21 16:40:36
yep!  its up-to-the-minute for orders of 1 BTC or less.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:11:10
we are happy to have you as a merchant!
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:01:10
Stop by the BitPay office in Buckhead!
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:51:24
yes, email us info to discuss
@_date: 2013-08-15 14:42:29
smart move!
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:28:24
This was a great discussion, one of the most engaging of the whole conference.  A great video to pass along to your friends to teach them about bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:52:02
looking forward to it!

Any of our merchants who use QuickBooks, please try this and give us feedback!
