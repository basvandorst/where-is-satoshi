30 $ or so.. Not that much..
It's nothing
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:24:30
Just relax. BTC is going to at least 50 000$ by the end of this year. ( I would said 100 000$ but.. anyway)
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:39:13
Hum, good question! 
I would not know what to do.
The good anwser was to buy a month ago! :)
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:37:08
if we do, then welcome 10 000$
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:27:18
Please stop stupid question.
Bitcoin is going up, more than 10 000 $
Really soon
Easy call
Just buy
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:01:35
you can dream
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:28:07
Lol! You are right! 
My dog can make this prediction too
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:21:57
Exactly! I don't know anybody who have Bitcoin or crypto (alt) (If they know what is Bitcoin or cryptocurrency at first... because almost of people don't even know)
I tried to explain to my haircuter how I will paid to her in the futur with my cellulaire with my Bitcoin. 
I'm not sure she understand yet..
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:36:42
I prefer to wait till BTC reach 15 K or more before buying ......
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:34:12
Good point !
If you can't short, why someone would like to see the price going down?
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:37:41
It's an amazing opportunity to buy BTC.
BItcoin will crash one day for sure, like always, but not now. 
Not enought people in to fuck up!
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:26:53
You are wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:25:20
You will be able to do money soon 
Just don't make this mistake twice !
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:24:30
it's not a crash.
250 is nothing
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:52:19
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:17:53
8260 free fall 
watch out
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:24:47
The sky is falling
Bitcoin is going to zero
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:19:18
The sky is falling.
Bitcoin is only 7 200 $. It was 3 500$ 3 months ago :(
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:40:11
You are right.
BTC will be well over 10 000 $ before the end of this summer..
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:36:07
Don't trade Bitcoin. Just hold it on a Trezor
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:48:20
Yah, just went to full the gas tank
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:02:03
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:29:14
Then you have big balls! 
Bigger then mines for sure!
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:02:56
Sell the house, the dog and the wife to buy BTC,
ah, keep the dog, but sell everything else!
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:37:09
It's not because you can't figure out what is happening than everyone else does.
It's not "bold prediction". It's a fact actually.
You will see.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:08:12
as 11h08
DJIA -570
BTC +570
coincidence ?
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:55:11
mass adoption of crypto currency is coming this summer
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:52:34
Sure, 
Mcafee said it will go to 1 million by 2021
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:32:09
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:01:50
Lol! 
Bitcoin bull run is on!
You should not sell right now
You should buy insteed
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:56:09
10 K for sure..
I can’t understand why you don’t see this..
So easy call
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:41:10
If you still don't own any Bitcoin, I think you should buy it now.
You won't have a better price if you wait more.
Don't worry about 500$ price variation.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:54:44
Yup, BTC will go up big time really soon.
You need to be a zombie to not see it
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:10:53
thank you body!
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:59:01
in one year, we will say : I just buy the dip at 125 000$, lucky I am to get Bitcoin this cheap!
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:01:09
No, it's going down big time.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:19:17
The trick with Bitcoin is to hold, not trade. 
It's like a digital gold, that why it will go up.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:15:15
And when are you planning to rebuy? 
At 10 000$ at 12 000$ ? At 20 000$ 
At 30 000$????
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:59:59
I think so.
It will going down hard.
Finally maybe the Bitcoin bubble have already bust
RIP BTC
It was nice to play with you
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:19:01
yup, big move for sure.
May be up or down
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:06:20
It's a nice sideway
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:53:27
Good strategy
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:20:05
The market did not crash yet...
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:06:57
I think stock market will finish green today. 
As usual!
On the other hand, I expect BTC to go up too.
BTC love to go up during week-end, while nobody is watching
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:10:13
So what?
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:43:58
I can store your Bitcoin on my wallet too. Just send to me, and I will send to you back when you ask .........
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:17:54
well, maybe
we will see.
I'm pretty sure 8 000$ usd is cheap right now for a BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:25:00
bull market = hold..
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:55:24
LoL! What a bad idea
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:34:07
Bitcoin is like a cat, Bitcoin have 9 lifes.
