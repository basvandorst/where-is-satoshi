Maybe file a wire fraud / theft complaint with the secret service.   Looks like they have completely masked who they are, but  are a registered corporation who can be subpoenad by the secret service.  If they got manuel noriega out of panama they can subpoena these guys.  Since this is an actual theft by wire fraud you can probably get the US government to fight it for you.  If you are outside of us, maybe there is similar law enforcement in your area?

The part of this article where they say the value of the dollar is dependent on the imports of oil to the US, and the chinese importing oil and paying with yuan will replace it doesn't make any sense to me.  The value of a currency is in what you can purchase with it, not what the issuer of the currency wants to purchase with it.  That is they entire idea of the gold standard.  You can't trade your dollars in for gold, but you can trade your dollars for Oil, Natural Gas, and Food, all made in and exported from the United States.  You cannot get Oil from China with Yuan.  You can sell them Oil for Yuan and buy cell phones in Yuan, or you can sell Oil for Dollars and buy food with Dollars.  If you issue your own fake ass ICO you cannot buy food with FakeCoin, but you can sell FakeCoin to koreans for dollars then buy food with the dollars.  The Koreans cannot buy dollars with FakeCoin.
