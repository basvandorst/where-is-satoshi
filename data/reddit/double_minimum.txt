I own bitcoin, and misplaced coins back when they were $7 a pop.
Blockchain is something that will continue on.  Why that would be in the form of Bitcoin instead of another crypto is what I'm asking.  We already have dozens of other options, with some being pretty damn serious, like eth.
And if you really think that simply buying 1 bitcoin will have any impact on your children's wealth over buying the same value in AAPL or GOOG, then damn, will be interested to see the future massive upperclass.

But we are talking 100 years, so not some unlimited time.  
I understand gamblers ruin.  I just don't see how anyone betting on this has to do with its value over time.  With an unlimited amount of time, you'd be foolish to pick any value over zero.  The likelihood of bitcoin even existing 500 years from now is tiny.

Honestly, I don't think thats what this depends on. 
I really doubt bitcoin will get to that price in 100 years.

Oh i understand that.  Its kind of specific, and since the majority of people vaccinate, odd.  
My vaccinated kid's grandkids won't see bitcoin at $500k

My point was that it doesn't so much.  I don't think 70 years vs 7 years is the difference here.  
But damn, them kids better be vaccinated.  Or have their consciousness downloaded into a computer.  Either works for me...

Do you really think that? 
I agree with the 'zero or' part.  But what makes Bitcoin the crypto that will be worth so much?  I see increased competition, and while bitcoin is the biggest name now, I just don't see and guarantee that would be the case 100 years from now.

Someone is long Bitcoin.  Does it hit $500,000 before my children are dead?

Can you explain how what that means in this scenario?
I'm not certain it applies, but interested to hear how if it does.
