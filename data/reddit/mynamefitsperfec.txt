Yea well there are 100 threads on reddit and bitcointalk about that site. Before spending btc on something, you should research more. But I bet you learned it by now.

Lol, you act like every human is entitled to getting a piece of the cake. Sorry this is the harsh truth, you have a bad financial situation. Those people you mention don´t. Sucks being poor - speculation on cryptos is not for everyone.

They would be pretty stupid if they did, but here is how you can proceed:
Their domain was registrated at PublicDomainRegistry.com.
You can request info about the registrar there, but they will probally not give away any data to a random guy.
This is the address of "them" according to the domain registration:
High Bluff Drive, Suite 38 , CA 92130
That is a "fake" virtual address from 
You can also request info about the registrar of "High Bluff Drive, Suite 38 , CA 92130" there. But I also doubt that they will give you any data without court order.
At least try both before contacting a lawyer / police - because that will be expensive and your chances of getting your money back are low anyway.

It´s highly unlikely. You can google all the results you find and see if anyone had any success - but I doubt it. They most likely registered the domain through an anonymous domain provider using Proxies and paying with crypto. I don´t want to give you hopes so think of the money as lost. What I would do in your case: Do a daily google on "bitmain-alliance.com" or "bitmain-alliance" and order the google results by date. Check if there are any new threads and read them. But most likely you won´t get your money back.

I´m coming up with 32.33 (repeating of course) percentage gains.

Woops, you fucked up.

How is it going m8? Bought back in?
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:38:54


I never doubted that. But as i said: we were close to 5k. Bold people would have sold there or during the drop down to 4k. I just commented on the unlucky fact, that you bought close to the absolute low. So far you probally didn´t buy back in. Lets see if your boldness will be rewarded.


4 more days to go. A lot can happen.


Once again you feel the urge to insult me.

Full paranoid version:
Generate a btc address/private with an offline tool that you run on a computer not connected to the internet. For extra paranoia: use a live-system like Tails to generate your keys. Then put the private keys on a usb-stick, preferably encrypted (VeraCrypt). Do this encryption right on the Tails system. Either remember the password you used for encryption, or write it down on a paper. Store the paper / usb-sticks at differnt locations, preferably in a safe. Keep in mind: A safe is also the first thing burglars steal / open. So either have a very secure safe (connected to a massive wall) or don´t store the plain private key or the password for them in there.
I would recommend uploading your encrypted file into different cloudservices (google drive, dropbox). You may lose a little saftey, but at least you can recover your keys if you lose the usb-sticks / your house burns to the ground.
Then transfer your coins to your address and wait to become a millionaire.

Someones getting defensive. 


You shouldn´t justify decisions with unrelated earnings in the past. But then again I am no trader, so what do I know.


That´s your decision but you know yourself noone can predict the price. It might drop to 500$, it might never see 3500 again. All I was saying: We had a peak at 5000ish which was calling for a market correction. Yet you waited until 3000 to cash out. Now we are back at 4000. No matter what the future will bring, currently i can repeat my words: "woops, you fucked up". :)

Don´t wait to long for a dip. The next dip may be higher than the current high. So if you buy now and the price goes down next week, just buy again and be even happier. 
Buy as much as you can afford and use dips to average down.
