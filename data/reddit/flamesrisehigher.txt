I guess, but in an internet argument where there are people who know little on the topic viewing the conversation, I think your message would ring clearer if you could say "No, you're wrong because...." and then point at your own source of readily available information that indicates the consensus among historians.
My point is that your argument isn't just private to you and the OP. There are numerous lurkers who read and take opinion from your comments, so it pays to provide sources even when the burden of proof isn't on you, because you'll be affecting the opinions and viewpoints of not just OP, but of the lurkers who may be listening to the potential misinformation that OP is laying down.

I think he's trolling, bro. Free bitcoin for everyone goes against the whole concept. Seems like a completely illogical statement meant to rustle jimmies.

I don't understand why you don't just post a source. You called out his use of Wikipedia, but you provide nothing to back up your own words. A shitty source is still better than no source. 
Why bother trying to ELI5, when apparently you've been studying this for a while? Why don't you have sources you can provide us? Even just point him to a book. This argument goes nowhere without a source that points to the start of Libertarianism.

Yep. This line was a definite indicator of that.


It was just shitty editing, not fake news.

I just don't even know what to think.
