I had absolutely no problem finding it. Try to make it less obvious that you are an apple fan boy. Can't even connect the latest iPhone to the latest Macbook without adapters ����

Get the fuck out of here moron.

Gemini is so good. Beautiful interface, great security, mechanisms to prevent the CEOs from dumping all their cold storage and running. And they are in the heart of the financial district in NY (this has both pros and cons but mostly pros)

He is right. I never in a million years thought I would have this kind of patience not to tell during panics. But I am holding on because it couldn't be more clear this is an attack by whales.

You are yelling at the wrong people bro. You gatta chill the heck out. There is a reason they all hate WA and its not to "fuck you with". It's Washington it could be so many reasons but your regulations fees are stupid high nobody wants to do exchange business in Washington lol

For someone loosing "thousands of dollars by the second" you don't seem to know what you are doing.

Localbitcoins was open all weekend during the “attack”. And Gemini did the right thing closing for 8 hours. They don’t want a million dumbfuck panic sellers blowing up their support asking why their transactions are not moving at the speed of light. They perform weekly server maintenance on Gemini sometimes for hours so seeing them freezing BTC transfers for 8 hours or so isn’t the end of the world. You still could buy and sell BTC during the freeze you just couldn’t move them.

Today was the day!

Sometimes that seems easier then trying to get John McAfees products to actually work. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:55:54
Lol people will complain either way. "My transactions are not going through". "I can't trade Bitcoins when nobody is confirming whaaaaaa". Don't blame Gemini blame the attacks on Bitcoin and the miners. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:51:15
You are absolutely right. You don’t have to buy anything. Bitcoin included. Clearly the volatility and rapid change in the mempools are not suitable for you and your needs. Things are changing to address the scaling issues it is talked about daily. But we are sort of in the middle of a war and war comes at a cost to everyone. This isn’t going to get solved overnight. If you wanted that, you should switch to a centralized regulated coin that doesn’t need the whole community to agree on something.
