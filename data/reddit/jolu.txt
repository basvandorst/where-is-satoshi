You think all 238 million people living in the EU have access to internet? ....

Pretty easy opinion coming from a rich guy with enough fiat resources to not look at the price. I missed condolences for the people who got their lives ruined by mt gox.. (no i did not have any funds there either)

You think everyone here is American?

i'm from Germany and even i know people living in rural areas without proper internet connection. Implying that people in the polish countryside are skyping with the olive farmers in the mountains of Greece is just ...you should travel more.

@_date: 2017-03-31 13:01:56
Great point, thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:01:29
That is not the case for my Country. :P

I'm supposed to analyze a political dimension of bitcoin and would try to prove that the idea behind bitcoin and the community itself do hold a certain ammount of libertarian views, such as a negative perception of government &amp; regulation, would you agree?
@_date: 2016-02-18 09:49:10
well, if bitcoin is only about tax evasion, its a) bound to fail and b) totally useless as an asset for all mankind. the healthiest societies in europe are the ones with high, well enforced and even better spent taxes. its about how you spend taxes for a greater good, not about wether you tax people or not. 
bitcoin has other more important functionalities in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-02-18 09:16:04
the tax evasion schemes are crazy and an blatant insult to every taxpayer. you really like that?
@_date: 2016-02-18 21:48:46
Here is the full video (5:40h) of the Apple-Hearing on tax evasion. enjoy!

What the fuck is that part about - are you serious? Looks like we live in totally different Germanys then.

well, look around. Yes, in theory. No, in reality. Because banks like to act like cartels and fix everything, from prices to libor rates.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:03:24
Seriously? The more people interact with bitcoin the better. The way People do it doesnt matter at all. Stop seeing Bitcoin as some kind of contest and celebrate your infantile competition some place else.

Im trying to imagine what bitcoin could do good in africa - could some one elaborate on this? I have to admit that my knowledge about africa is very limited.

Seriously? Litecoin is a huge pump right now and its gonna be an even bigger dump soon. Mentioning it in makes it an even bigger pump in my opinion.

If you ask a Rep., Democrats do. Could you leave politics out of this? :o Besides, its not just US media. It's global.

this is a good post, nice recap of what happened so far - i'm not an expert so i can't either agree nor disagree on the details about whats gonna happen but thank you for the recap so far.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:31:49

i totally agree. that greek letter stuff is way too nerdy for the rest of the world..
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:28:27
This is bullshit. ...
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:26:02
i feel fucking great all the time. i've not been in for a "long" time but i've bought right after the crash in april, so as long as its not going down to two digit dollar prices, i'm fine. 
the bitcoin "universe" is extremely entertaining.

and don't you think thats gonna change soon? ~
