Did anyone see the crash in 2008 coming? Didn't everyone back then think things were going just swell as well? Or is this time *really different*?

And I thank my lucky stars those people are around. Else the world wouldn't work. And those people are way more fun to be around than "intelligent" people by the way. Just some food for thought for the narrow sighted dweebs on this subreddit.

That's 10% at this rate. Not that much imo. These are big numbers yea, but relative change isn't that much compared to single and double digits for example...

It's cool you guys are proactive concerning account security. It still baffles me though, that a company who handles millions of dollars every day, has no telephone support.
Any half-legit company out there at least has a phone number on their webpage, much less a company that handles a fraction of the funds you guys handle.
Here's to the bitcoin space, always being secretive and never including a telephone number to call. I guess if things go south, you guys can still bail without getting bothered on the phone by pesky customers.

Most people actually know and realize this. Smart people are surfing the gains but not expecting anything else out of it. Does that make me a moron?

Ohhh you must be so sour you missed out.

This will never be mainstream, as Bitcoin, is the real shitcoin. Huge electricity wasteage, toxic community which can't create consensus, no mechanism to create consensus (and there will never be one),  unable to scale (rofl lightning), Chinese miner monopoly, huge fees, multiple forks, no ability to build ontop of BTC etc etc. Bitcoin is doomed to die you just don't know it yet.
Enjoying the rise though.

So, throwaway account with 1 post and everybody believes him immediately?
Trying to lure in some more dumb money into btc while it's still going...

Nice counterarguments, bro. Guess you have none (because I'm right).

Max Keiser is a piece of dogshit. There's really no one lower than him. Or wait Roger Ver perhaps.

I actually feel pretty good of myself. Surfing the gains of a shitcoin like btc, and in the meantime I'm picking up the worthwhile projects with a future at discount prices.
Enjoy your 34 times forked shitcoin called btc. Your shitcoin with the Chinamen miner monopoly. Your shitcoin which will never, ever become the true topdog coin in the long run.

How are they changing it without access to my e-mail?
2FA is enabled on accounts so thank god they didn't get in.
But still how the hell?
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:43:51
No they effectively changed the password without clicking on the confirmation link in the e-mail. I never even received e-mails asking for confirmation on the changed password. Just a notification that my password has been changed.
I checked and compared the header and the e-mail address with the one in my own e-mail requesting a password change and it's the same...
Already changed all my stuff but this is really weird.
Also, i checked my coinbase history and there were a whole bunch of IP's trying to log in from the US, taiwan, thailand, philipines etc...
There was nothing on the account but still.
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:22:19
It were official messages and in both instances the passwords were changed.
How did they do it?
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:16:22
I actually got the email confirming my password was changed though. How is that possible without them first clicking the confirmation link in a seperate email?

It will probably get as much volume or more if they expand their licenses to the remaining states and other regions in the world.
