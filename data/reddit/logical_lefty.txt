I think almost anyone invested in the cryptos at any amount can unfortunately relate with you, homie :(
I have a very close friend who I had talked to about BTC when it was 500/coin in Januaryish last year. He had just gotten a bonus, and was clean and could finally invest money instead of blowing it on dope, and he was really excited about buying 1BTC and putting the rest of the bonus into an IRA.
Well, another one of our close friends got wind of this and relentlessly tormented him with passively aggressive bs about "suckers who buy bitcoin". This other guy is a great person, really, but tbh hes a trust-fundifarian, has blown tons of cash that was just given to him, and is not at all any good at investing.
He successfully talked the first guy out of buying BTC.  One year later he finally stopped giving af, but his 500$ only affords him .04BTC lol

I don't regret calling you a "lying sack of criminal shit"

I've been in this game since 2013, and watching that 12k sell wall get crushed on GDAX might have been one of the most incredible movements in BTC I've seen in a while.
To the moon my friends, to the moon!

I'm licking my chops hoping that they try to scare the weak hands out so I can buy them dips.

Has someone already contacted the author asking them why in the hell they thought putting Cryptsy in the article happened? This is the kind of mistake that casts doubt on the level of work as a whole.
I'll do it if I have to.

You're replying to a comment from an hour ago, do we need a reminder of how bitcoin can move 20% in an hour? No need to start cussing at people on the internet over it.

Yeah, fuck bcash. I took what Coinbase gave me from the fork, watched that shit pump all the way to 4k and dumped it all for Bitcoin and ETH faster than a palomino can find a price of shade.
I don't fuck with people that poor-shame Andreas and shit on the very Bitcoin that they so desperately bootlegged.

I could've written this XD Ive been in since 2013-2014. After the bubble popped, I just used it as a way to pay for certain stuff because I believed in it, but didn't have the expendable income to make an *investment*. I luckily kept a crumble of a coin but I could've paid off my student loans day 1 after graduation. Now, **not so much**.
It hurts--deep down inside.

Time to sell my Bitcoin, I guess?

I too, have had my measly BTC earnings lost into DS9.  Au revoir, Mt. Gox.

You're both right, but I would venture to say your answer likely takes up the majority of the pile. 
If young people in Russia don't know about crypto like that (they sure as hell can't afford it with how terrible the Russian economy has been, not their fault), then there's your sign that it's the kleptocrats.
I would like to add that the amount of American hospitals getting hit with ransomware over the last 3-4 years is nearly beyond belief. I work for a marketing company and we have a client who specializes in educating/training businesses on cyber-security and have heard a staggering amount of horror stories.

I can speak for only my own millennial self, but my love of Bitcoin brought me into the world of investing as whole. It was my gateway drug. I think Millennials understand the significance of denying the class dichotomy that previous generations have given to us and blazing a new path incorporating the benefits of multiple options.
Maybe that makes, sense maybe it doesn't. Idk.

Yeah, its shoddy writing but this all came from a financial times article that claims to have recieved the correspondence from the US Copyright Office directly.

I made a deposit on 11/6, I am told to expect to see the btc released to my account tomorrow the 12th.  They won't let me make any other deposits during this waiting period.  Kinda sucks, but oh well. This is a new thing, I kind of expect logistics to be fucked at first.
