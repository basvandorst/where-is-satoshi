"bitcoin index and forex etc."
they're so scared they don't even know how to write anymore.

are you serious or just kidding? man relax, bitcoin is going up, how fast and how soon does not really matter.

it's just two numbers, look at them and compare them yourself, 6 year old can do it

it is mathematically very possible, it just takes an enormous amount of computer time, mathematically

hopefully there are no vulnerabilities in SHA256, it's not like it's been developed by Microsoft

mining is more about power efficiency than speed, running code tailored specifically for an ARM, only a better ARM would be more power efficient, that would mean next year's mobile phone

useful quantum computing is mind boggling, if it becomes possible we have no idea how it can be used and what can happen next

As a long term safety net in case anything is / goes wrong with SHA-256 encryption and the current mining scheme: 
Could a secondary blockchain be kept in parallel, everything the same, same data, just using an alternative encryption method?  
secondary idea:  
\- make the encryption scheme ARM-friendly  
 i mean: an algorithm that would fit the ARM cpu like a glove  
\- the mobile phone industry has pushed hard to make the ARM very energy-efficient  
\- the combined power of people's phones is probably hard to beat  
\- also nice that people would want to not use the phone so much so that more battery power would be available for mining
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:45:01
I didn't mean a change to the current mining scheme, I meant a parallel scheme done by a separate mining team, for ex everybody who is invested in bitcoin, on their phones (more power efficient CPUs than x86, specially if the encryption is planned so that the algorithm will fit ARM's capabilities)
@_date: 2019-09-22 11:45:35
...I def do not mean creating another coin, just adding a safety net to bitcoin in a respectful way. In case nothing wrong ever happens it will stay as an invisible safety net. If something goes wrong people can cling to it
