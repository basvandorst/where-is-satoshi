Just to try to understand what happened, so you can learn from your error (even if it's not your fault because no one should steal even if I leave the door of my house unlocked) 
Was your password easy?
Have you given some app whole Dropbox access?
Did you enable 2FA on your Dropbox account?

You are talking about your Dropbox or wallet encryption password? Was the wallet backup file encrypted?

Bitcoin has been created by aliens that took this technology on the earth as an experiment. This is way the creator is anonymous and we have a so big technology in early 2009.
They are more smart than us and they probably use something more technical advanced on their planet

I periodically backup my laptop on an external offline hdd. And if it gets damaged too at the very same time I have the seed on paper.
I was more wondering more if it's bad to have it stored locally on the laptop since it's always connected on internet

I am not login in that app indeed. Better to wait. Maybe someone hacked the website to replace the app with a malicious one?

What about storing it locally on the laptop folders?

I feel so sorry for you mate! I wish you the best and I hope you can have a wonderful life even without those money.
Unfortunately they are just thieves (no need to call them hackers) as the same way of thieves stealing cars, entering houses or intimidating you with a knife in your shop.
I neither would say they are smarter than the previous ones, because maybe they are good at hacking but they just won't be able to physically robber a bank.
But they are all thieves the same way, only difference of being good in something else. They deserve a bad life.

Bitcoin had been taken on the earth by aliens more smart than us living somewhere in the space. Maybe as a test, maybe to help populations.
This is why the creator is anonymous, because he is not human and doesn't live on the earth 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:11:37
Thanks
