Again, I don't see how he was misrepresented? The direct quotes and the basic inferences are accurate. True, you may sense a deeper inference in the selection of that specific quote above others, but are you seriously claiming that journalists should ensure every single party is happy with *every conceivable inference* - justified or otherwise - in the structure of their articles? That's a Monty Python newsroom. Nothing would ever get published.
It's this notion of journalists "doing it wrong" that is flawed. I write about 100,000 words per year, mostly features. I, like most journalists, am pedantic and anal, but every year some errors will creep into those 100,000 words. When that happens, are you justified in hoisting up my one single mistake, and telling me I'm bad at my job?
Most professional journalists who avoid getting fired have probably got a 99.99% success rate in their writing. It's lazy and dishonest to uphold the 0.01% of errors as evidence that a given reporter is incompetent or unethical. Moreover, it might not be their fault. How do you know the sub-editor isn't to blame?

I don't even get what vqpas is trying to say. But anyway, the level of vitriol being upvoted on this thread kinda validates my point. A lot of people are abusive and condescending to journalists, and it's rarely warranted. If you're intelligent, rational and polite enough to air your objections in a reasonable manner - like Erik did - then more power to you, whether we agree or otherwise. But if you only know how to spew personal hate and peddle conspiracy theories, then frankly you don't deserve an audience.

I'm a journalist. Everyone who talks to journalists should understand that this is how the job works. In news reporting, as opposed to feature writing, 90% of every interview is glossed over, and tbh I'm not sure it's a bad thing. The interviewee's remarks should help shape the journalist's understanding, but the interviewee has no right to expect that certain remarks / angles will be quoted / reflected in the article.
It may seem unfair, but that's how journalism works. Put yourself in the reporter's shoes, and it's not hard to see why. So IMO you should just take this as a lesson to be more sceptical. And if you want to engage with the media, hone in on either a reporter you trust, or a *feature writer*. The latter will be much, much more willing to use lengthy quotes.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:00:17
Er, yes it is. You might have an outsider's ideal about how journalism should work. But in the real world: yes it categorically is. Try being a journalist for a few days and tell me if you find a better way. You won't.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:42:14
Based on OP's description, I'm not sure he was misrepresented. The reporter was just very selective with which quotes he used.
I understand that bashing journalists is a popular sport, and it's expedient to argue that most of us are lazy and unethical. But again, put yourself in the reporter's shoes: you cover countless different subjects, few of which you'll ever become an expert in; you have very high-pressure turnaround times for copy (especially on a print newspaper); and you've got an editor barking often unreasonable demands at you. You need expert comment, so you talk to as many people as time permits, and then you frantically listen through the recordings to pick out what appears to have been the most on-topic remarks. In this case, clearly the loss / potential theft of millions of dollars of bitcoins lies at the heart of the story, and the reporter was correct to focus on that.
Let me put it another way: on very, very rare occasions, I'll talk to someone and not use their quotes in an article. Maybe they were off-topic, maybe they weren't particularly eloquent, or maybe the clock just beat me to it and I had to deliver whatever copy I had available by the deadline. Does that make me a bad journalist? Can you honestly say you'd never encounter the same scenario, if you did this job day after day, month after month, year after year?
It's easy to criticise hacks; that's all I'm saying. By definition, journalists have the fine detail of their work scrutinised every day by thousands of people. The feedback isn't always fair or proportionate, and it sucks when someone who really doesn't understand your job tells you how to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:00:40
Yawn. How clever.
@_date: 2013-12-08 12:01:32
Um, yeah. That's not really how bubbles work though, is it? You don't get to "choose" when the recovery starts.
Look on the short-term charts and we're still firmly below all moving averages and pushing lower with each touch. A few hours of consolidation does not equate to a recovery. The charts suggest this crash is probably not over yet.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:45:46
I'm not familiar with the term 'wall'. But I suspect it relates to this: traders place automatic buy and sell orders with their exchanges so that if price moves to a certain level while they're sleeping / away from the computer (God forbid), the exchange can automatically act for them.
There are two types of orders: limits and stops. Limits are placed at a more favourable position (so if you're buying, a lower level; or if you're selling, a higher level). Stops are the reverse (so it's an instruction to buy at a higher level, or sell at a lower level). The desirability of the first type is self-explanatory. But why, you might ask, would someone want to sell at a lower level, or buy higher?
Answer: breakouts. Globally, there are millions of orders waiting to be triggered in any liquid market. Traders and investors tend to cluster them around psychologically significant levels (eg $1000), or other levels that might be flagged up as lucrative by a variety of technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD etc). Now consider one example to understand how a 'wall' (or flat level) forms:
Let's say price is $990. It's been rising for weeks, but met resistance at $1000. It keeps bouncing down from it. Traders around the world notice this phenomenon. The bulls are convinced that **if** it can be broken, it will be plain sailing ahead. So lots of them place buy orders at $1001. Crucially, the bears - despite believing the exact opposite will happen - have also placed buy orders around that level. Why? Because they're shorting the market (i.e. sell high, then buy low). They might have put in a sell limit at $999, and two corresponding buy orders: one a limit for taking profit if, as expected, price gets rejected (e.g. $980); and one a stop for cutting their losses if, contrary to their expectation, there is a breakout (e.g. $1003).
So when you have a situation where both the buyers and the sellers are placing near-identical orders - but for totally opposite reasons - this creates a very compelling trading opportunity. Visually, on a chart, it appears to look like a 'wall'. But if the wall can be broken, you will get a big bounce in price as the entire market's buy or sell orders suddenly get triggered.
Apologies if that's not what you were asking about...

Sir, had I not sold all my bitcoin at a depressingly low price, I would tip you. Spot on too.
One further development of the point: in order to look at the market objectively, pay more attention to long-term charts rather than short-term ones. The weekly chart may be like watching paint dry, but it cuts out the noise &amp; shows you what's really happening:  (It's a long way down to those moving averages...)
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:41:58
My god you are arrogant. You're presenting opinion as fact. You, like the rest of us, have no idea what price will do.
I love how people like OP think they can tell the market "you're doing it wrong" when they don't like its direction. That is arrogance to the extreme. It's also very selfish, because you're fostering unrealistic expectations among people who have put their savings at risk. Just let price correct itself, and it'll hopefully embark on a more sustainable long-term growth rate. Bubbles are good for no-one.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:42:03
Depends what kind of protection you can offer buyers. Stubhub only really works because it guarantees to refund buyers' money if the seller turns out to be a scammer. Also, I can imagine some frustrated buyers who quickly realise that the shitty little Justin Beiber ticket they paid $150 for this summer has now cost them $1000 in real terms. It may not be the best marketplace for bitcoin.
Civil aviation, on the other hand, would be a mega win. Global airlines take payments in a dizzying array of foreign currencies, using complex currency hedges to minimise their exchange rate risk. A single hedging strategy for bitcoin payments would make their lives much easier.

Nope, that is not "sure". That is a guess.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:06:18
But you have a choice now. Turn just a fraction of those BTC gains into filthy fiat money, and you'll be hedged against catastrophe. I'm not suggesting bitcoin is in peril at all, but it's always sensible to scale out profits as you climb the ladder. No matter what you're dealing with.

'Wodge' is an awesome word. Just sayin'.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:58:59
Valid question. I can see two possible, unproven answers to the hoarding problem:
1. If price eventually plateaus, the problem disappears.
2. More headfuckingly, if the entire world transitions to an inherently deflationary currency, then consumers' mindsets may shift over time. At the moment, people feel encouraged to spend fiat currencies because they know they will steadily lose value through inflation. But fiat currencies normally (not today, admittedly, but normally) have the potential to be deflationary too, if you store them wisely. By burrowing USD into a bond or savings account, it can appreciate in real terms. Bitcoin seems to be doing the same thing, only without needing to be stored in a savings account. It would take a major psychological shift in the concept of money before this is accepted, but it's not outrageously far-fetched.

At today's collective psychological norm, yes. People are desperately waiting to jump back in at about $500. But if price starts falling rapidly, then fear will build about catching a falling knife. People will lower their target entries, and suddenly $500 will seem relatively pricey. Trends gather momentum whether up or down, and markets invariably overshoot.
The biggest mistake anyone can make right now is presuming that this market is rational. You or I might be acting rationally (I stress, might), but the 9yo kid who got his parents to buy him in? The retired Guardianista who bought an overpriced bitcoin on eBay? The jittery Chinese dude who just put a significant proportion of his wealth in bitcoin (and is now lying awake at night wondering what the fuck he'll do if the market crashes). No, these are not rational actors. They can sell just as irrationally as they buy.
Believe in bitcoin's long-term potential. Don't believe that it will be traded maturely by the masses in the short-term. The only word describing the past three weeks is "mania".

Incidentally, the lost password issue does seem a major obstacle to long-term legitimisation. Can anyone with technical knowledge explain if - conceptually, far in the future - it would be possible for large wallets to be unlocked by governments / savings institutions, where sufficient proof of ownership can be provided? Or would it be necessary for those institutions to keep a registry of private keys? (Imagine hacking that...)
