You are grasping at straws and doing whatever you can to rationalize your narrative. First you have no idea what I am discussing and than magically find the first piece of propaganda to support your narrative. It doesn't matter if the number is 10% or 90% because 100% of them are innocent until proven guilty and Obama's actions are illegal. Don't like the constitution , than rewrite the fucking thing , don't ignore it and expect we won't notice. It is also interesting you would choose to trust a bunch of lying, psychopathic murderers above a journalist as well. I don't expect journalists to get everything right but how can we even judge the accuracy of the reports when there isn't any transparency in the military and the government is caught repeatedly lying to the public?

The launch is a disaster- 
Care to explain why you have been advertising no additional fees - 
"Does the Xapo Debit Card carry any additional fees?
No. After the initial $15 fee for the physical card and shipping, merchants will pay all fees just as they do for debit and card cards but there won’t be a fee for the customer."
and than slip in a ton at the same moment you start shipping out the cards?
You should have given an explanation and allowed users time to decide to cancel or not based upon the dramatic changes.
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:58:15
I sympathize with them if outside forces made them change their fee structure. The problem I have with them is slipping in these changes at the last moment at the same time they started shipping the cards for 15usd. Most of us get better deals with traditional banks and find this fee structure absurd and would have never wasted our time and signed up. 
They should have apologized and gave an explanation weeks ahead of shipping the product. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 12:07:56
I would contest that they are both unlawful, illegal(constitutionally), and unethical, thus calling those action by their rightful definition is apropos. I suppose the truth and horror that 90% of these murders are knowingly killing innocent bystanders instead of their intended targets (which may or may not be innocent as well) may create a strong incentive for you to rationalize these atrocities. I would like to extend an invitation to try and apply consistent definitions and ethical principles and realize our responsibility in the matter.
@_date: 2016-03-30 12:41:01
"some innocents "?!?? "Some"?!?!? The numbers are 90% by the CIA's own records and that is assuming their intelligence about the 10% of targets is accurate.  In fact, all of the individuals murdered are innocent including the 10% of targets. Don't you guys brag that criminals are innocent until proven guilty? Not only is war unethical and not pragmatic at solving problems, it is also illegal in this case because The US hasn't officially even declared war as mandated by the US constitution despite all these acts of war . These drone campaigns are ongoing and the president is well aware the ratios of non-targets murdered to targets murdered and still decides to order the death of these humans regardless of the predictive outcomes every time and without consideration to due process.
@_date: 2016-03-30 11:20:16
yes, That last statement of Obama being responsible for 1 million deaths is a large exaggeration. Obama certainly should hold a greater responsibility for the mass murders he requests in all the countries where the US is at war or drone strikes are occurring vs the average taxpayer but we are all responsible directly and indirectly for those deaths.

 &gt;5 Conclusion
Currently, there are several digital currencies implementing some form of proof of stake consensus including  Peercoin, Nxt, Novacoin, BlackCoin and BitShares. However, **pure proof of stake approaches pose substantial  security threats** that cannot be recreated in proof of work systems (including Bitcoin). **These problems are  inherent to proof of stake algorithms, as proof of stake consensus is not anchored in the physical world** (cf. with  hashing equipment in proof of work).
That is why virtually all of currencies relying on proof of stake use additional mechanisms to address security  issues. For example, the initial distribution problem can be solved by using a timeconstrained version of proof of  work; double-spend attacks can be prevented by including information about recent blocks into transactions. Still,  these improvements can be seen as ad-hoc and incomplete. Unlike proof of work, proof of stake consensus  is not objective; the state of a PoS system cannot be reliably determined by new users based solely on protocol  rules and a list of blocks and other network messages obtained from peers. In order to prevent long range forks  of the blockchain, a proof of stake system needs to implement weak subjectivity by combining protocol rules  with  social-driven security. The social component of PoS systems weakens their decentralization and  mathematical soundness. As Vitalik Buterin puts it [20], “[A]ll “pure” proof-of-stake systems are ultimately  **permanent nobilities where the members of the genesis block allocation always have the ultimate say.** No matter  what happens ten million blocks down the road, the genesis block members can always come together and  launch an alternate fork with an alternate transaction history and have that fork take over.”
   A recent development in proof of stake are delegated systems. While these systems solve several major  problems with the straightforward PoS implementations, they are not yet widespread, making it difficult to  evaluate their security. Nevertheless, delegated PoS solves the “nothing at stake” problem and prevents short  range attacks on the system.

All modern wallets use the reference implementation for dynamically adjusting fees -  --  `-txconfirmtarget=&lt;m&gt;` (default: `2`).  It is a scandal that wallets are still manually setting fees or that we need to even have this conversation. I have nothing against you or your wallet personally , but I will be highly encouraging users to avoid it like the plague so their tx don't get delayed or never confirmed. I never have problems with Immediately getting in the next block when I use copay , mycelium, or core and I perform tx's daily. I look forward to you catching up so I can stop discouraging users from avoiding using your wallet and perhaps even recommend it.

As much as I hate to admit it , USD fiat is better because despite inflation has far less volatility than gold or silver thus is a better unit of account . Hopefully someday bitcoin will surpass fiat with this characteristic and become more stable in time.

Do not put words in my mouth, I never insinuated they are honest or in the right. I merely am suggesting that if you are stupid enough to give BTC or fiat to a company or stranger , you better damn well be sure that you can legally support how that fiat or btc was acquired to later take them to court if needed or at least provide some evidence to others. You see, even if a company is 100% honest they have regulatory and legal pressure to perform KYC/AML so it is tremendously naive to expect them to take that bitcoin anonymously and expect them to protect their clients against the pressures from states. Do not give BTC or store gold with third parties if you want privacy! Better yet , buy BTC and gold and immediately withdraw it and secure it yourself.

Using the protocol to determine a wallets floating fee or using a site like that is an accurate means of determining the fee amount as I never have had issues getting in the next block when setting high priority or the second block at worst with normal priority. It isn't perfect and their could be some fringe cases but it is 1000x better than manually setting the fee like it was 2 years ago. It is scandalous these wallets are still doing this and I suggest users go elsewhere - Core , copay and mycelium all use the protocol floating fee to auto determine the correct fee.

@_date: 2016-06-15 23:45:32
you paid too low of a fee, what wallet are you using and what priority did you set? Your tx was very large with 961 bytes thus you did not pay a reasonable 50 satoshis per byte or higher. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:23:27
Some are orchestrated and some are indeed relevant due to horribly outdated wallet software being used by uninformed bitcoin users. I just heard today that Jaxx still manually sets the fee instead of using floating fees which is obscene! During situations like these we need to inform users to switch to using proper wallets so their confirmations aren't delayed.
@_date: 2016-06-13 01:15:47
Many reasons , perhaps the exchange is fractional reserve trading because their burn rate was too high, perhaps they were previously hacked and hoping they could earn back the loss with time from tx fees , perhaps the owner or employees decide they want to steal the btc while the bank is full. A bubble presents a scenario where there can be large outflows and inflows , and during those outflows if the exchange isn't solvent than things can go bad quickly.

Bitcoins Key value Proposition is regulatory arbitrage by providing a secure sovereign immutable ledger. Digital (encrypted ) fiat isn't anything new and by placing their txs in blocks it doesn't magically make their currency better. Most of them are likely aren't even aware why bitcoin needs to group txs in blocks in the first place rather than simply passing encrypted messages. The whole title is silly as well because 99+% of fiat is encrypted digital currency.

No there are other ways to define spam -
 
Just because it is somewhat difficult to determine if certain txs are spam doesn't mean they don't exist. Some are very easy to identify, some almost impossible. None of this matters because I am perfectly fine people spamming the blockchain if they are competing in a fee market and paying their fair share.

It is safe to assume the algo that determines which orders are cancelled favors coinbases profitability allowing them to front run bitcoin sales for a small but consistent profit. It is likely the same with most exchanges so I'm not simply picking on coinbase either. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:14:07
Thanks for clarifying. It still could also be unintentionally benefiting coinbase because the independent fraud algorithm just happens to flag txs more that could hurt coinbases profitability. There doesn't have to be a conspiracy or intentional ill intent for this to be real. It would be interesting to analyze these algo's but I also completely understand why it would also be a closely guarded company secret leaving us to speculate.

This is fundamentally antithetical to bitcoins principles. Bitcoin is a currency that uses the free market to solve the economic problem not communist robots in an RBE society who vote upon resource distribution. What you are suggesting is that you fundamentally oppose bitcoin but temporarily prefer it against other forms of fiat because it is less evil and therefore a transitioning step that you will eventually discard.

I see you paid 0.0000518 BTC which was about 3 pennies which is a bit low. Right now since there is currently what appears to be a spam surge, 9 pennies will get that same tx confirmed in 0-2 blocks and 12 pennies will guarantee the next block.
You are exaggerating, but your overall sentiment that fees are a little higher is correct . Normally one would expect 4-5 pennies for a normal priority and 7-8 pennies for high priority. I suggest you view "high priority" = 95% likely to get confirmed in next block and "normal priority" as likely to be confirmed in a few blocks, but this is the exception to that due to the spam.

Bitcoin is not deflationary, but disinflationary when referring to Monetary inflation -  How it behaves in an economy is strictly a measure of supply and demand thus bitcoin can act as inflationary or deflationary as there are no central planners adjusting interest rates. Do not believe the lies and propaganda spread by those fear mongering the dangers of deflation and the Keynesian scare tactics when they spout terms like "deflationary death spiral" . We already have good evidence this is bullshit by seeing more spending and donations during periods of rapid appreciation or deflation with bitcoin.

Most banking fintech is very outdated and some improvements in processes could make matters slightly more efficient, but not because of "blockchain" technology directly. We already see some banks getting wise to this and dropping blocks altogether like Corda and the reason many are pivoting away from using the term block chain to DLT(Distributed Ledger technology). If you understand that Bitcoin is a horribly inefficient database that is betting on being more efficient than banks efficient database+ regulators+ lawyers+accountants+ auditors, ect.. than you will understand why banks adopting blockchain technology and keeping all that overhead is a non-starter.

You may be temporarily be friendly to bitcoin as a stepping stone but are diametrically opposed to many of its principles. If you truly purport RBE you are merely using bitcoin as a means to an end.
 basic-income could of course be carried out on a social level with any currency but isn't incorporated within bitcoin and is somewhat contradictory against the principle of PoW where one gets paid when they prove actual work instead of just being alive. 
You cannot remove the amazing invention of currency with removing the need to accurately determine price to solve the economic problem. Scarcity is a fact of nature and it is very naive to assume it doesn't exist. Case in point- I desire a pyramid sized entertainment dome covered in the most expensive 5k LCD screens. Would RBE be able to provide that? If not , than scarcity exists and currency is necessary to accurately and efficiently determine price and allocation of resources.

Segwit will increase blocks to around 2MB thus you are creating a false dichotomy. The real question you should ask is :
Increase blocksize with segwit which provides these benefits - 
or 
Increase the block limit by changing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE variable which doesn't have any added benefits and requires a hardfork which has a good chance of splitting the network.

 Core has no ability to allow or deny the vote . The vote is occurring right now and we see BU plan has around 8.6% vote and Segwit has a 27% vote. Thus far there is a 3 to 1 ratio in favor of segwit.


Many other things to work on to improve bitcoin. From speaking to core and many members in the community we are happy with the status quo as well and can wait as long as needed, even over 1 year if it takes that long to get consensus. (I think segwit can find it in 2-3 months IMHO)


Go ahead and create 100 more choices , the voting is occurring continuously and no one can stop you from doing so. 


There already is alternatives , and they are doing far worse than segwit. Feel free to submit your own BIP to core or to any other dev implementation for peer review if you can come up with something better than segwit;good luck , segwit is a amazing proposal and will be hard to beat.

Most Alts are testnet scams that break the 21 million limit and thus devalue bitcoin. Your metaphor with the shoreline doesn't follow as bitcoin can ebb and flow with fiat and gold. One can gamble directly with bitcoin itself by leverage daytrading and casinos so this isn't a valid use case for alts. 
The first slight benefit of alts is some do have some interesting technical characteristics and can act as live testnets with bounties to motivate attackers and so outsiders can study game theory and the security implications of these testnet scams. There are somethings that a testnet with no value attached cannot provide and even if one were to gamify a testnet for motivation it still would not motivate some behaviors or attacks. 
The second slight benefit is alts do provide a little bit of competition to bitcoin that fiat doesn't provide to motivate us to keep improving bitcoin. The network effect gives bitcoin a tremendous advantage but doesn't guarantee it will stay number 1 if it doesn't evolve. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:05:46
Yes you are correct sir and for these reasons-
1 -- BCH has a bad brand due to many proponents having to lie and steal Bitcoins branding instead of competing on its own. Another aspect of the brand is Bitcoin has a longer history of node compatibility , controls the BTC/XBT tickers on exchanges, has shown to be more decentralized and has proven itself to resist takeover attempts like segwit2x which is important for branding.
2 -- BCH has almost no usage and a very small community that is shrinking 
Bitcoin on the other hand has growing usage. 
Bitcoin has as much onchain transaction activity as the previous peak -
This is also not including lightning transactions , and sidechain (liquid) transactions which didn't exist back than. Thus the usage of Bitcoin has surpassed the all time high and growing daily while the usage of BCH keeps dropping.
Even with this high traffic Bitcoin fees remain extremely low with wholesale rate as cheap as a few pennies onchain
3 -- BCH marketcap and more importantly buy support is low and shrinking 
Now sits at a low 1.13 % or 9th 
4 -- BCH has incredibly low security and hashrate 
Between 2-5% SHA256 which means that doublespends and reorgs are more possible.
5 --  Because of the consequence above some exchanges are requiring more confirmations for BCH transactions making BCH slower than BTC
6 -- Bitcoin has far more merchants, users, and investors. A bigger network effect 
7 -- Bitcoin has more implementations and more developers and better developers 
8 -- Bitcoin has more institutional interest from ETFs, futures markets, commodities markets with CME/CBOE, BAKKT, Fidelity and more 
9 -- Bitcoin has a far better roadmap with scaling efficiently onchain and in layers to onboard the world in a secure manner.
10 -- BCH still has the ASICboost vulnerability and has yet to completely resolve transaction malleability
11 -- Jihan/Bitmain has a very large bag of BCH and is having tremendous financial problems and the new board will be forced to slowly dump their BCH on the market to pay off debts. Estimates reflect ~1.2Billion in losses in 2018 and huge debts to suppliers like TSMC. Their dishonest IPO and trades have placed them in legal hot water and they are being sued by many companies. Keep in mind that Bitmain created BCH and funds much of its development and promotion which means BCH is in trouble not only because they will be forced to start selling their accumulated BCH
12 --  BCH is losing in value against BTC in this bear market 
13 --  BCH is more volatile and less liquid than BTC

Yes, the free market will clear him out for making silly investments

BCH is a horrible currency because its too volatile.
Look at BCH volatility - 
Bitcoin is the least volatile, and LTC/ETH/XMR all are less volatile as well.
It also is so insecure they no longer follow the whitepaper with Proof of work determining consensus, but developer timestamps doing so now. POW is only used for short term transaction ordering on the chaintip. Companies like coinbase should require more than 12 confirmations instead of 6 for BTC because of this. Such a slow coin due to being insecure.

I pay a few pennies onchain to load my channel and than far less one penny per transaction with lightning making my transaction fees far less than BCH.

Agreed, thus why I indicate that the little evidence we have contradicts Keynesian theory and that evidence is insufficient thus the answer is we should withhold judgment until more data is found on the effects of disinflationary currencies and the deflationary bubbles they create and the consequences of such. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:30:02
There really isn't any good data to reflect that a scarce disinflationary currency that acts deflationary is the cause for this economic turmoil as Japans economic problems were not happening in a bubble and the deflation was caused by structural changes in the workplace , ageing demographics, and problems with trade. 
The only , insufficient evidence we have , of a controlled supply disinflationary test case with a large enough market cap to be statistically significant is Bitcoin. Thus far during periods of High appreciation(defaltionary bubbles) spending and charity increases 
instead of the myth that people will hoard leading to "deflationary death spirals". This data comes from large bitcoin payment processors so does not merely represent more speculation and daytrading. 
This appears counter intuitive until you begin to analyze human psychology a bit deeper. While people will tend to want to be more careful spending if their currency is rapidly appreciating, they also are more likely to want to spend because the wealth effect, they feel wealthy  because they are wealthy and thus more likely to splurge. Many also want to take profits due to the acknowledgment that the deflationary bubble will indeed pop and thus spend their currency as well.

There are valid arguments as to what actually was the underlying reason for deflation during the great depression and how it wasn't a scarce currency that was the central problem to societies economic woes. 2 principle schools of economic thought argue over this = Keynesian and Austrian.

There will always be income inequality even if everyone is society starts with the same amount of income and income opportunity.

Yes, exchanges representing +95% of the volume are a big indicator but don't underestimate the importance of individual economic nodes as well.
