Yeah but I'll deal with the slow confirms as long as we don't botch a hard fork like Ethereum. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:53:57
Slow confirmation times. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 01:12:39
But the standard number of confirmations to be considered complete is around 3.
@_date: 2016-04-28 16:18:03
Quicker than 2 business days? 
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:47:02
Are you saying you give him cash and return home to see if the coins were transferred? What the heck, man! You should be using a mobile wallet for this. Mycelium on Android or Copay on iOS. Sit there and wait 10-15 minutes to get at least 1 confirmation. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:39:41
I meant does fiat arrive in your account quicker than 2 business days when you sell. Coinbase is pretty good about this. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 15:26:35

@_date: 2016-04-13 19:59:34
Drugs are already legal - booze, cigarettes, caffeine and the one's "they say" are okay at the pharmacy. Anyone else tired of the government telling us what is and is not a drug? 
@_date: 2016-04-06 17:49:36
Hmm. I had not heard Mycelium had pulled support for their iOS version. Anyone know why?
I have both Breadwallet and Copay on my iPhone and hands down Copay if I had to choose. I know this is not the popular opinion on this subreddit but Copay allows you to modify transaction fees, they have a send all feature and you don't have the hassle of constantly syncing. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 23:55:34
What exactly is the Lightning Network? I'm assuming a way to speed up confirmations?
@_date: 2016-04-17 20:11:40
Let's try getting a little more creative. One reason for owning a Trezor is to keep people from stealing your coins, including banks. Sort of pointless if you just store the seed in a bank's safe deposit box. Especially the recovery slip that comes with the Trezor that basically says "look here for money".
Your actual Trezor should be okay with a PIN but they're all kinds of ways to store the seed. Buy a pocket dictionary and maybe circle or highlight the seed words. I'll leave you to figure out a way to remember the order of the words but how many people would pick up a dictionary with a few circled words and think jackpot! 
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:35:21
You mean the web platform was down? I'm pretty sure that's when you use Trezor with Electrum or Mycelium. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:21:33
I can't do a $2k transfer on Circle. They have me limited to $300 on a 7 day rolling basis and I've submitted all documents including the ID selfie. 
Ironically, I've never submitted verification documents to Coinbase besides linking my bank account and I can buy up to $2,500/day. Odd.

Doesn't have any bids. Didn't Andreas say he sold his car for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:30:21
Saw the show last night. So the guy who made the 50k BTC bid did not even have 50k coins? So what was the point?
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:06:43
Well gold doesn't take 5% daily swings, so there's that.
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:32:59
My point is that Coinbase has an incentive for crypto to increase in value. These opinions are marketing. Problem is, disruptive tech usually doesn't need this much.
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:50:16
Wow, mention any other cryptocurrency in and get blasted with downvotes and people unwilling to have a conversation...
I'd say LTC and BTC are related in the fact that industrial miners mine LTC and dump for BTC. So now that LTC is over $3, maybe they've put the brakes on dumping until the outcome of the halving in August, thus keeping the BTC price lower if LTC did not have a halving coming up. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:53:12
No offense guys but I think we're getting a little carried away thinking ALL things purchased with Bitcoin should be discounted. The original idea behind this was comparing things that could be purchased with credit/debit cards and saving on merchant processing fees. 
In this example, selling a car, it can be done with cash. I actually think the seller takes on more risk because let's say the car is sold for $20k but a month later the price of Bitcoin drops 20 bucks which leaves the seller at a $2k loss or more because everyone wanted a price below market value just for using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:00:21
Chargebacks are not all bad. What if you receive defective merchandise and the merchant refuses to work with you.
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:24:25
@_date: 2018-08-31 06:04:07
Because your brother wanted crypto. Did he get $4k in fiat? Doubt it. 
I could buy a car with $4k in chocolate if I found a buyer. Does that make chocolate money?

Lol. The BTC community is really consumed with paranoia right now.
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:28:51
Not really. The taxi driver doesn't have time to look up the tx fee. If he did, one more step when you could have used cash or card. If the tx fee was too small, it would become a chargeback. I'm sorry but Bitcoin is far from ready to compete with the legacy banking system. 
Fyi, if you didn't know. Estonia is a hub for ICO projects. Similar to Zug, Switzerland.
@_date: 2018-08-26 18:17:25
A taxi driver doesn't need to check online banking because the merchant processor is in charge of making sure funds are available. This is one of those prime examples of how decentralized taxi fares are possible but unnecessary. The foundation of the crypto bubble: throwing decentralization at things that don't need it. 
You know you can send Bitcoin without a fee, right? Chances are extremely low it will confirm and if it doesn't, the BTC goes back into the sender's wallet. 
Trust me, Bitcoin is FAR from competing with the legacy banking system. Even if LN works, the TPS are too low. 
You seem new to all this. Are you European? The crypto fad really took off there where many countries have high unemployment. The ICO's have created jobs but it won't last. The early adopters have made their money and cashed out. 
Chances are extremely low that any large central bank will ever get behind Bitcoin. Bitcoin is too slow, centralized and unstable.
We can talk about inflation, etc, etc. I know I did when I first learned about Bitcoin. If it really was a concern, the richest people in the world would be flocking to Bitcoin. They're safer ways to hedge against inflation and it's not experimental technology. 
But hey, feel free to blow off my opinions. Opinions are just opinions. Do your research, realize you don't know it all and that even the smartest minds are wrong from time to time. Good luck!

What's a Bitstamp Audit? Blockchain shows a bunch of addresses sending to this one as a Bitstamp Audit. Maybe the address is owned by Bitstamp or some crazy guy on Bitstamp going bullish on Bitcoin...lol
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:53:25
Well I think the average person would feel safe keeping the $50,000 in the bank. Like I said, you have access to it with your bank card and it's insured. The point I'm trying to make is that if Bitcoin is going to rival the status quo, it needs to be accessible.

@_date: 2014-12-09 08:50:30
That blew my mind, too. Lol. I also liked how he talked about AI/servers being able to send/receive "money" on their own. Bitcoin is so much more than being able to send/receive coins all over the world for minimal fees.

@_date: 2014-10-27 19:25:29
Thanks for the reply! Well good to know it's an HD wallet. That basically means all receiving and sending addresses are constantly changed, correct? 
Also, is the single address option in Mycelium just a way to utilize cold storage wallets? 
Last, sorry for so many questions, but is trading with Mycelium safe? I always thought the good thing about LocalBitcoins was that you can deposit money while the coins you're buying are held in escrow without ever having to interact with the seller. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:53:49
So you installed Electrum on a netbook with no internet connection? Doesn't Electrum need a connection to generate your address and keys? How is this better than an offline cold storage paper wallet?

1. Bitcoin is a highly controversial method of payment.
2. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that does not allow chargebacks. 
3. Uber is fighting for their right to operate in various markets. Their plate is full. 
Therefore, Uber not implementing Bitcoin has nothing to do with marketing.

@_date: 2014-10-29 21:46:56
Ah! So when you want to spend the coins you would just import from the offline system using a QR code and private keys, correct? Is it possible for the offline system to generate BTC addresses that already exist?

Yes, I was referring to owning physical bullion and not an ETF. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:40:44
I think I might try calling them before I just send them my ID. And if they request an ID photocopy, that might be it with me trying to use their service. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:52:17
Thanks for the reply! I really don't see how running Electrum in offline mode protects your private keys. If you're running Electrum on any computer connected to the Internet, your keys are still exposed, right?
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:56:28
Yeah at this point Circle seems like another Bitfloor. Just another startup with poor management.
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:57:53
Personally, I'm done dealing with Circle. I've given them a lot more information/time than I ever gave Coinbase. I'll leave my account in limbo and whenever they decide to be professional and reach out to me, I might consider using them. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 23:51:14
It's not that easy. If someone steals a phone they have to get through the lock screen which could be quite a chore if you have some elaborate pin/biometric combo. In addition, I'd wager a phone thief is more likely stealing your phone for the phone value as opposed to searching for BTC. Furthermore, if you're using a wallet like Mycelium, the thief would need to know your Mycelium pin to transfer coins or be a sophisticated programmer with so much expertise to be able to decrypt the private keys. So basically, in the event of a phone theft, the BTC user would have ample time to restore the wallet from seed and transfer the coins to a safe address.
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:43:22
Sometimes things happen for a reason. Circle has at least one Goldman Sachs board member and close ties to the current banking system. I think a lot of people tried opening Circle accounts looking for an easier way to buy/sell their coins but do we really want a company like Circle competing with Coinbase? 
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:26:15
I decided to call customer service today around 1:30 PM. I was unable to get through. The call would hold for like 5-10 minutes and then I would get some automated message about sending an email if it was important. Really!? I call within their limited customer service hours and still cannot get this issue resolved. 
For a company that claims to insure their customer's funds, I'm really starting to have my doubts when they cannot even answer their customer service calls. I'm happy some of you were able to setup your Circle accounts with ease but I would be very cautious going forward. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:09:23
Exactly! If you had $20,000 worth in an Electrum wallet on your laptop, you could throw your laptop off a cliff and still recover your coins using your seed. Look at Mt. Gox and Bitfloor as examples why users should secure their own coins.
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:18:10
So a wallet just generates an empty address with private keys but what if and I understand how highly unlikely this is but what if two users simultaneously generated the same address with two different sets of keys? Is this a tiny but very unlikely flaw with the BTC concept?
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:51:06
Maybe in this scenario, a microSD card could act like a Trezor for signing transactions and then you would just take it out.

@_date: 2014-11-20 03:00:52
I agree with you but why would you give Blockchain.info your email address in the first place? Only use as a hot wallet, utilize their 2 password system and only use Tor when logging in.
@_date: 2014-11-18 22:03:47
Seriously, we should try to unite both groups. Furthermore, those were terrible arguments for Bitcoin over gold. Lol how do you secure several kilograms of gold? Yeah because everyone has $70,000+ in gold laying around. Too funny.
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:56:39
I couldn't agree more. Nothing is going to be 100% secure but since I've been using Trezor, I no longer lose sleep over the "what if's" of losing my coins. Paper wallets are the next best thing but creating paper wallets on any computer that was EVER online is problematic and the cost of buying an offline-only computer is probably more than just buying a Trezor. Btw, Mycelium can also be used to restore your Trezor from seed.
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:39:13

As someone who is relatively new to tipping via ChangeTip, I've done a little research and realized Internet tipping is not new, especially over in the Dogecoin sub. That being said, why use ChangeTip over other methods and is it a matter of time before ChangeTip goes the Coinbase/Circle route and starts requiring ID verification, letters of recommendation, next-of-kin, etc, etc?

@_date: 2014-10-29 20:44:21
There must be a workaround because only keeping a few hundred dollars worth of btc on your hot wallet for fear of losing it could hinder btc growth. Think about the fiat system we have now. If I have $50,000 in my checking account, all I need to do in order to access it is have a plastic card and I'm good to go. If I'm uber paranoid and keep that $50,000 in btc cold storage, the transferring between cold and hot wallets becomes a pain.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:15:10
Privacy and security go hand in hand, right? Keeping your IP hidden from potential attackers will improve your security.

Another reason NOT to use Circle...
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:07:10
If he lost his phone and was using Mycelium on Android, he could wipe his phone remotely and restore his wallet from seed on another Android device. He could probably just walk into a cell phone carrier store and use one of the demo phones for free. Just transfer his coins to an address connected to a web wallet until he got things straightened out. 
OP, I totally understand where you are coming from. Companies like Coinbase and Circle require A LOT of information just to open an account. I'm sure they log how much you buy and who buys it. This was not the idea behind a decentralized digital currency. For now, like others have mentioned, try LocalBitcoins, Mycelium or a Bitcoin ATM if you happened to be near one. 
I can see the utility behind a company like Coinbase but I hope that's not the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:36:12

I'm not sure if commodities are almost always near production but think about it this way, what if everyone in the world wanted to own 1 oz of gold? The simple answer is that it would be impossible because that's how rare gold is and the sub $1,200 price is far from the true price.

If it was something like we decided to close your account because we think you're buying/selling bitcoin, that's pretty lame. I hope this is not the start of a push by the banks to distance themselves from people who use bitcoin; sort of like how the banks won't deal with cannabis dispensaries.

Can you elaborate on creating your paper wallet offline? If all you did was create the wallet with the router unplugged or even if you used a computer that was ONLINE at some point and now is not, there is still a bit of risk.

Many on here were unable to open Circle accounts without submitting the same if not more information required to open a bank account. Circle is far from a buy coins in minutes solution.

I tried to open a Circle account months ago and got stuck when trying to add my debit card. I even tried to contact support via phone during their limited hours but just got placed on hold till the call was disconnected. Long story short, I haven't heard from them.
I got caught up in the Circle hype without doing my research. Many people have had problems with Circle and further research revealed these guys are just legacy bankers trying to get in on the crypto rush. 
If you're happy with Circle and had no problem opening an account, I'd be super cautious.

The problem for non-savvy investors is that you can buy 1 BTC and by the next day it might be worth .9, .8. etc. You can put $100 in the bank and the next day you can be pretty sure you still have $100.
This is a real problem I haven't seen the Bitcoin community try to address. If I'm living in poverty, why would I use Bitcoin as a form of payment? Someone in poverty has a limited budget and even the small $5-10 swings really hurts purchasing power. That being said, is it fair that only people with disposable income can be "early adopters"? Could this be why the world's unbanked are not interested in Bitcoin?

One of the great things about Bitcoin is you can be your own bank. I wouldn't doubt if Satoshi saw the problems with the legacy banking system and must have thought there had to be a better way. 
When I was a kid, we had DOS aka Disk Operating System and if you did not take the time to learn it, you pretty much didn't use it. Now we have UI's so user-friendly and simplistic that senior citizens can read and send emails. Development and adoption doesn't happen overnight.

What's wrong with the current address form? Not trying to be a jerk but if someone is unable to comprehend and understand a Bitcoin address, maybe it's on them to educate themselves before they start using it. 
The Internet was like this in the 90's. Local libraries and schools would teach Internet seminars explaining how to use the Internet. AOL was like a packaged Internet service for those unwilling to learn new concepts but these days if you don't understand the URL bar, email and what a domain is, most people will tell you to pick up a book.

I find it funny how they want you to email them a photo of your ID as if this doesn't expose you to even more risk. Not to mention Circle is run by legacy bankers trying to get in early on Bitcoin. They have former Goldman Sachs employees on their board!
Coinbase is a better option but I would try LocalBitcoins, buying in person or finding a BTM first.

I'd say anyone who checks the BTC price on a daily basis for a significant amount of time, including myself, would say the price is most likely to drop even more but this is pure speculation. Your buddy might be able to buy-in for $10k at $100-200/BTC if he holds off a bit.

PayPal is a crappy company and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who rolled their eyes when they announced they would be implementing Bitcoin. If you're a digital nomad or operate any type of business via PayPal, it's only a matter of time before they lock your account. For me, they literally killed my business by requiring ALL payments made to my PayPal account be held for 90 days!!! Furthermore, from my experience, they will always side with the person making a chargeback 100%. They don't even investigate to make sure chargebacks are not scams where people buy something, receive it and then say they never purchased the item even though you have a tracking number showing product was delivered to their home address. PayPal has a monopoly on eBay and lately I've noticed wayyy too many ads on LBC utilizing this company. Use caution.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:10:13
I've been with them since they were ING, have used my account for Coinbase buys/withdrawls(more than a year ago) and thankfully my accounts are still open. After reading this, it sounds like Capital One 360 doesn't want to have anything related to BTC. Their p2p payment system is often used to buy/sell Bitcoin on LBC, which is why I can see them auto-closing all BTC-related accounts.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:06:58
I can easily see the price dropping below $100. Yeah the dip has exposed the bad actors but could this be simple supply and demand? Since ASIC's went all industrial, we've been mining more coins than the market demands. Period. They're enough coins to handle the small amount of users who buy/sell things, which leaves the true believers of Bitcoin but that's such a small percentage of people.

I'll take a look at your site and see if it helps. That's exactly my problem in that I just tracked buys and sells in USD, not BTC. So sort of like a pair of shoes has a right and left, my buys and sells are not 1:1. Some of my sells are partial, some of my sells were for buying things and sometimes I cashed out 100% but later bought back in. 
Also, I have a net loss of around $500. So I don't have capital gains to pay. Does that mean I don't necessarily have to report? Sort of like people who don't have an income don't necessarily have to file a tax return. 
Thanks for the help!

Here we go with the age thing, again. I knew this would come up because it was an issue for Ron Paul. In my opinion, the older you are, the more wisdom and life skills you have. As for youthful appearance, yeah Clinton and the rest of the GOP goofs really look like they could ride a century anytime soon.
C'mon, man. Bernie's platform is the only one that offers any real change. Does it not bother you that we could easily have a Clinton vs Bush pt II? What about the fact some bozo who DID NOT work incredibly hard for his money and talks bad about women and Hispanic's is leading the GOP polls? Be the change you want to see and don't just accept the status quo!

So why does Breadwallet feel so buggy all the time? Does Mycelium or Electrum just have wayy more active development? 
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:13:48
So more nodes than Mycelium and Electrum servers combined is why people favor SPV wallets? Interesting. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:15:39
I emailed them and all was fixed within a few hours. Quality customer service and would definitely use again.

@_date: 2015-07-28 07:38:29
I'm really confused why everyone loves Breadwallet so much. I mean you just said your last 3 transactions failed...??? All the rejected transactions, the constant need to rescan the blockchain, you can't modify the transaction fee and it would be nice if maybe Breadwallet defaulted to bits but allowed other options as well. Is everyone using an iPhone or what?
I've used Mycelium wayy more than Breadwallet and can only remember one tx not working and it even supports Trezor! What am I missing? Can Breadwallet do something the other wallets cannot?
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:30:55
Well the tx finally confirmed inside Breadwallet after a 4th rescan. It never showed like 1 confirmation, 2 confirmation, etc. Just went from unverified to confirmed in block whatever. Should users be cautious of Breadwallet right now? Recently, I heard some ppl using Hive were having trouble getting their coins out. Not sure what's going on.

Tier 2 on Kraken doesn't even require you to submit documents. Just email, name, DOB, phone number and address. Pretty nice so far. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:27:15
So increasing the block size will reduce transaction fees? 
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:29:18
So I thought Kraken was the way to go but turns out their website is full of misinformation. Tier 2 is supposed to be able to deposit and withdraw fiat but when you try to move forward with a fiat deposit, it says that feature requires Tier 3. Seriously, this is the kind of crap keeping mainstream adoption from happening. Tier 3 wants more information than a bank!

@_date: 2016-02-25 00:15:20
But doesn't keeping transaction fees up sort of protect the network from things like spam? 
@_date: 2016-02-23 05:03:27
Wouldn't rebroadcasting with a higher fee get a quicker confirmation, thus voiding the tx with the smaller fee? 
@_date: 2016-09-27 17:18:58
I wasn't talking about the people in SF being able to afford those things. I meant the average person not even in a tech related field. Let's say someone in the Midwest.

I'm a professional trader and a lot of my colleagues, including myself always say the next big scandal is happening while we're waiting to hear about it. Right now interest rates and not raising them were just in the media and it's just the big thing to talk about right now. Sort of like the Pokemon fad of financial news right now. Most people don't even understand how raising interest rates would tank the economy. The truth is, we don't know what the next bubble will be. Could be central banking, student loans or one I'm taking a close look at is the overvaluation of tech. Just got back from SF and these tech companies are spending massive amounts of money on unneeded things. Sort of reminds me of SF before the dot com bubble. But how many people are going to be able to afford Uber, Airbnb and a new iPhone every year if we do see a recession larger than the one in 2008? Another breadcrumb I've noticed is Bill Gates keeps liquidating Microsoft shares. Never a good sign when the large shareholders are getting out.

I've been in your shoes. I discovered Bitcoin very early. When the price fell in 2014, I was certain it would change the world. In a way, I was right. 
An entire industry has been created. Within that industry is a race driven by greed. People want to pretend this is going to help the world because they own coins they want to see succeed. 
Listen, if you're not happy now, no amount of wealth is going to change that. You say you have a high time preference but that time is not promised.

This is a common mistake people make when they hear half the world's wealth is held by less than 100 people. Most of the world's money is not even physical anymore. When someone says he's worth 1 billion dollars or this country is giving X amount of billions in aid to another country, they're not referring to physical cash. The idea that armored trucks are hauling billions in cash from one bank to another just doesn't exist. These days money is just numbers on a spreadsheet that all the banks agree on.

I'd like to see you work 40 or even 50 hours a week on the current minimum wage. Let us know how it goes! I have a feeling you'd be saying hi to mom and dad sooner than later.
Sanders' policy regarding raising the minimum wage is based on the idea that nobody working 40 hours a week in this country should be living in poverty. Period. The cost of goods and services has gone up while the minimum wage has remained stagnant. This is one of the reasons why we have an income inequality problem... Make sense?
Also, stop with the dramatics saying anyone who disagrees with him will go to prison. That's a blatant lie. Sanders has a stellar civil rights record and is even in favor of closing the privatized prisons.

Congrats but this might be why the downtrend continues. Bitcoin was intended to be a currency and not a mechanism for people to hoard in hopes of getting rich.

I figured transaction pickup was a supply and demand equation. I've used 0.0001 on mytrezordotcom and 0.0005 with Electrum and time of day seems to be the bigger factor. I doubt all miners are left on 24/7, so if you get stuck broadcasting when most of the world is going to bed or just waking up, that's when you run into the 1 confirmation taking an hour hurdle. I've never noticed mytrezordotcom taking more time to confirm than Electrum, so for now, I doubt fee amount really matters as long as you include one.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:01:06
Exactly. All sorts of games were played when Ron Paul isolated himself from the GOP, like the mainstream media giving him minimal screen time and I even heard something about Ron Paul delegates having a hard time getting into the convention. 
The sad truth is the republican nomination will be won by the candidate who can raise the most fiat and right now that person seems to be Jeb Bush with his swanky $100k/per couple dinners and not declaring right away(which allows him to raise unlimited amounts of money until he's an actual candidate).

Isn't 0.0005 too much? My Trezor always prompts me that it is when I use it with Electrum and mytrezordotcom uses the standard 0.0001 fee.

From a trader's perspective, the ETF will enable a regulated futures market.

You can't go wrong with a Trezor. Before I had mine I would be all paranoid about my coins being stolen and about what malware/viruses might be on my computer looking for my private keys. Now I don't even worry about it. Plus, it works with both Electrum and Mycelium if you don't want to deal with mytrezordotcom.

What happens when Coinbase closes your account? We all want a Bitcoin debit card but is it possible to have a decentralized version?
@_date: 2015-11-17 19:03:31
A few questions so we are all on the same page here. I own a Trezor and love it but I have been interested in trying out a Ledger product.
What do you mean built around a secure element? Trezor is not?
Is Trezor not open source?
Also, if hardware wallets are meant to be like digital keychains, why would one want to lug around this big touch screen?
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:04:56
I bought a Trezor and stopped having these worrying thoughts. C'mon dude, you have 4.3 BTC and can't spring for peace of mind? I'm pretty sure there is now Trezor support for Electrum and Mycelium. Plus, I think one of the recent firmware updates added multisig if you really want things on lockdown. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:15:16
I think you had this problem because Mycelium uses BIP44 structure while Breadwallet uses BIP32. Mycelium to Electrum should work just fine because they use BIP44 structure. 
Not an expert on this, just my guess from a quick search on the topic. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:59:53
Has anyone noticed that whenever CNBC mentions Bitcoin, the price falls? I think this time it was around $8 but it's moving back up.

The film might be obsolete because it has a mining for profit focus and the exchanges/companies talked about are no longer around but in my opinion, it's best at explaining to non-technical people what Bitcoin is and what it could be. The Morgan Spurlock documentary zoomed by Bitcoin's beginnings which is key to understanding Bitcoin concepts.
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:12:41
I actually think the price is right around where it should be, maybe even lower. I mean think about how many coins exist and how many people actually USE Bitcoin for more than investment. 
I was listening to a Bitcoin podcast the other day, can't remember the name, but one of the hosts was referring to a hypothetical situation using seashells as money. I guess the problem with using seashells is we don't know how many seashells a house or car is worth. We know 1 BTC is worth X amount of fiat but what can Bitcoin buy on its own? When you start to look at what you can buy with Bitcoin, without converting to fiat, you see your options are pretty limited. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 03:50:05
You obviously don't own a Trezor or you would know the seed is backed up on paper.

Maybe no SEPA but I've heard of people using Ripple to buy/sell Bitcoin on those exchanges. Btw, Kraken is SF-based, no? 
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:17:08
The tagline for Bitcoin has always been be your own bank. How is using Kraken as your wallet being your own bank? Is there any difference from using fiat to fund a brokerage account?
Here's the thing, Bitcoin exchanges tend to be unstable and go under without notice. I'm sure you heard of Mt Gox but there were others like bitfloor, which even had some of my money tied up for months. I was lucky and bitfloor returned the funds but some exchanges just vanish.
If it were me, I'd at least use a hot wallet I controlled like Mycelium for Android or breadwallet for iOS. You could always look into hardware wallets like Trezor if you are trading large amounts.
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:12:04

@_date: 2016-07-11 16:47:19
This is a very noob question but that's okay, we all started somewhere. I'd open accounts with both Circle and Coinbase. That way if one goes down, you have a backup. 
GDAX, the Coinbase exchange is probably a good place to get the feel for trading but I'd put all that on hold for now. Just buy some bitcoin, play around and learn how to use it. Learn how to keep your coins on your wallet, etc. 
Jumping right into trading as a novice is like playing your first game of tennis against Nadal. Odds are stacked against you. Learn what trading is all about. Are you a fundamentalist or technician? Head over to and get the basics down by asking questions, maybe even try the moronic Monday thread. Best of luck!

Most simplistic answer is supply and demand. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 05:31:15
I get your point but unless you know code, you have to trust BitAddress is not malicious or the Mycelium paper wallet generator. At least with Trezor, you could wipe the device upon arrival with a new firmware. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 04:03:01
I guess it depends on what you mean by offline computer. If you just switched off the WiFi or disconnected your router while you created the paper wallets, yeah probably not good. If you uninstalled the WiFi antenna and that computer has never seen an Internet connection since, you're probably okay.
@_date: 2016-07-28 04:20:20
The only other thing I can think of is you used a corrupt version of Bitaddress. I guess risk is minimized by using an offline computer but you never know these days. I used to worry about this stuff all the time until I got a Trezor. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 00:29:41
