Yup, mainly government sites in my region. Screenshot from 2015
Edit: Well ok , that screenshot says it accepts Firefox &amp; Netscape. But hope you get the idea of the insanity.

Just remember: When chaos and crash comes down, HODL! (and buy more)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:24
Buy, put in cold storage, forget about it and hodl
Then every us-election year, check price... buy things or retire if you're happy where you're at.
Or check every time the world cup is hoisted... whichever floats your boat.

How does he get a wallet address with his name there like that?

Look at it this way: What do you want Buffet to say in public?
Anything he say in public even slightly favorable to bitcoin will accelerate the shit out of cryptocurrency, which we yet to have a good foundation to scale. Even if he claimed he put $1000 play money into bitcoin, medias and grandpa's is going to spin the FOMOs out of control.
He doesn't need the 1000x growth, I'm sure he's observing on the sideline. Once BTC has gained its public value, say $100k, I'm sure he won't mind riding in late and go just 10x to the McAfee promise-land. This still makes him the top-5 richest.

Look at it this way: How do you want to drive a Lambo in public?
Anywhere in public even slightly favorable to its massive 335/30/R20 tires will accelerate the shit out of noob drivers, which they yet to have a good foundation of race track techniques. Even if drivers claimed he put 1000hrs playing video games, driver and his gf will spin out of control.
Drivers don't need the 740hp, I'm sure they'll be fine just looking at them from the sidewalk. Once the driver has gained decent track experience, say 100 laps around Nürburgring, I'm sure he won't mind owning a Lamborghini late and just go 10mph to car &amp; coffee events. This still makes him a top speedy driver in that meetup group.

I’ve been reading his blog for years... first time he dedicated a post to talk about Bitcoin. Not only that, he is not overly negative about it.
He definitely has more things to say about Toronto’s housing market, so I’m surprised his view on btc wasn’t super bad.

In the crypto world, which I hope the following example can become a reality in my lifetime:
- A person wants to buy a house, needing 100,000 units.
- This person opens a request to the network, requesting 100,000 units from the crowd, with an interest rate of return
- The crowd chips in, fulfilling the requested amount.
- This person goes on his/her life, providing goods and services to sociality earning crypto units, and repaying back the crowd on a regular basis.
- No extra money created in the system. Just units of crypto flowing back and forth among many individuals.
Edit: There's a lot more involved, and a ton of holes to cover up from the example above. So the above is just a general outline.

Can you cross post your finding here again tomorrow?
Don't think I can find your post tomorrow buried in all the stuff happening on this channel :) Thanks!

don't have headphones or YouTube access at the moment, can anyone give a TL;DR for this? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:12:33
I just saw his interview on stage talking about Bitcoin. His entire comment about bitcoin really reminds me of Steve Ballmer laughing at the iPhone 10yrs ago...

So your plan is keep a stash of fiat on the side, and then buy some when it goes -10% (eg: Saturday night), and then sell some when it goes +10% (eg: yesterday)... ?
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:10:52
I think gambling typically imposes a deadline where a win/lost decision must be made by random chance at a specific time.
Whereas BTC hodling, you don't have to exit... you call the shots when to walk off that "table" and owns the full ability to do so at any moment of time (eg: when returning of value are favorable).

I'm not sure, probably an invention yet to be explored.
Some kind of worthiness or trust science, socially discussed &amp; debated.
Maybe a specialized role in such new sociality, ones that 'sells' and present said risks to prospect loaners?
The only thing I can refer to using today's mechanism is Kickstarter... but has to be stronger and better.
Edit: spelling and typos

serious ask: any source of articles relating to greece people buying playstations? genuinely interested to read more about it...
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:47:26
Thanks! Yea, I will be doing that soon....
There's a 3-7 days withholding depositing fiat into exchanges, as soon as that clears, I'll pull them out.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:56:45
:( yea that's the unfortunate downside... there's only one big player here and then some small locals. Cashing out BTC would be a challenge plus a huge hit on the marginal gain.
I'll be treating this as an "inwards only" setup... probably with a DIY cold storage device.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:32:15
ah ok, thanks ! Still waiting for them to verify my credit card but that's good to know fees are not that bad... 
yes, those are definitely play money I am willing to lose or not touch.
BTC could probably do better than me hoarding collector-edition video games :D

Seeing this thread, I thought there's going to be a black friday sale for BTC

My view is that by that time, government are forced to run more efficiently because of restrained income. Ultra efficient like a smart startup or tech company.
Then, smart taxation should be more welcomed and citizens generally would be more gladly paying their true fair share to support sociality.
