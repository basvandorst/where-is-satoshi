Yeah that's what I'm thinking, I'm even willing to invest into a pro to dig deep into my old phone 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:40:15
I have the information to my Apple ID back up account yes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:41:59
I've tried hooking up my iPhone to a computer to see if I can look for the private key using a program, I forgot what it was called. I followed all the steps but I'm not a pro at that kind of stuff 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:37:25
There are no passwords connected to the wallet. Literally the public key is the password. That they assign to your wallet when you download the app

Thank you everyone for your help and support. There's just so many messages to reply to, even if I don't get to reply to all of them at once I will take the time to read all your suggestions, in the meantime I'm trying to gather as much information as possible. If I do figure it out because of anyone's suggestion I will reward that person because at the end of the day it was originally like a $580 investment. And if I didn't lock the account in the first place I probably would have spent that money two years ago anyways, that's why I'm not stressing out too much about it, it would be nice to get it out though.. will update soon

I been trying to figure out for years lol I forgot I even asked this question before 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:49:07
No the app you just download it, doesn't ask for email or password it just gives you a public and private key 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:22:40
I wish there was but there isn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:51:30
I'd probably even offer them 1/3 of the funds 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:16:59
lol I have conversations from years ago with a friend that prove the wallet is mine 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:43:05
It's not an app that asks for passwords. It just downloads onto your phone through your Apple ID and automatically gives you a public and private key. And if you delete the app it resets it to a new one 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:19:38
No, but I will do further research on it in the afternoon. Hopefully I can get somewhere with it thanks
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:36:26
Ive tried everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:22:12
Yeah this is basically what a person from but wallet told me. They don't require anything for registration and nothing is connected to the address. They don't save people's information 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:48:31
yeah I know!
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:18:48
I backed up the phone before I put the coins in because it was a wallet I used before hand 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:19:39
Yes that's the problem, I'm looking for someone with good reputation
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:40:56
Yes I have , the thing is once the app is deleted it only lets you get back your public key not your private key 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:08:35
its called "bitWallet" for iOS
