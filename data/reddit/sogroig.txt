Still the miners need to know which transactions are in the block before starting to construct the next block.

It's still not easy even with no confirmations. The app will need to try finding a block. When it has a block (this means you can cash 50 BTC) you can risk not sending it to the network right away and someone else finding the next block (losing 50BTC), and instead trying to implement a double spend attack.
For low value items when the attack can't be automated as in the case of a venting machine this will be unprofitable for an attacker. Even with slightly higher value items you might make such an attack unprofitable by waiting 1-2 minutes regardless of confirmations.

Also since the robber doesn't know how you handle your bitcoins you can simply just say that you have done one of the above while you just have an encrypted wallet somewhere.

I don't see how putting bitcoins in a safe defeats its purpose. Wallet will be encrypted so the bank can't access it. Also since its just a data file an alternative service that woks like a safe with a few optimizations could be made. 
You can also encrypt a wallet multiple times and have different people you trust have each key. That way a robber will need everyone involved in order to rob you. There is propably a clever crypto way to only require a certain percentage of the keys as well as yours and even if there isn't an app can be made to make multiple encryptions with all the permutations of as many keys as you want.

Makes sense if he owns a bank.

Eh... I don't know... this could end up hurting bitcoin a lot. So there would be bitcoins that are worth less since not everybody accepts them. If this where the case the barrier of entry would be higher since everybody would want to to implement some method of not accepting them before starting to accept bitcoins.

MtGox handled it even worse by releasing lies. That doesn't mean that not releasing anything is much better.

It depends on which was posted first. For example, if you place a bid higher than the lowest offer you will fulfill the offer at it's price and if your bid is bigger volume than the offer you will also fulfill part of the next offer.

They are not fake verification blocks. They are blocks that could be used if the difficulty in the blockchain was lower. I think you do not understand what mining does and how the difficulty affects it.
The problem you are trying to solve when mining is to find a number that when combined with the current bitcoin transactions and checksumed will result in a checksum lower than a value that is derived by the current difficulty. If the mining pool accepts from its clients higher values than those that are accepted by the blockchain in the current difficulty, it can calculate the mining speed of the clients based on the rate of those answers. It can also check a few of those randomly to make sure they are not cheating.
There is no loss in speed appart from the checking it would do to combat cheating.

I didn't know the difficulty was set in the block header, but even if that's the case I doubt the pool would send you an invalid block since they can simply encode in their client that they want all solutions of a specified difficulty send.

The one issue I see with bitcoin and I think it is kind of serious, is the mining pools. I wouldn't have a problem with them If no mining pool had more than 10% of the processing power (preferably less), but mining pools with more than 30%... that defeats the point...
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:07:07
I bet you can buy the two largest mining pools for a lot less that that though.

It is so annoying when sites that only ship to the US don't make any mention of it anywhere. This is only common for US sites that only ship to US. On any other case you can usually find where the site can ship.
