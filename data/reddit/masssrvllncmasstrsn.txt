Go download Daedalus, buy some ADA on Bittrex and send it to your wallet.
Note how long it takes to arrive and how long it takes to get a few confirmations.
Cardano is building a solid infrastructure from scratch. It’s not a fork of another project.
What is this “only a white paper / vapourware” meme? It simply isn’t true.

I would also accept “snowflake”.
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:31:33
No. I think you may be thinking of EOS.

There's little reason for shilling the wallet itself. At this stage it has basic features for wallet recovery, receiving and sending (but it has a cool logo and solid UI).
I'm hoping Ledger Nano S support similar to how the ArkClient works will be implemented soon, along with staking - and having the light client will be nice (at the moment it takes a while to sync to blockchain when you open the wallet).
Cardano is a project similar to Bitcoin Core - devs are taking their time to build the foundational tech the right way instead of trying to rush - while trying to ignore the FUD, shilling, and noise. But Cardano is taking the extra step to peer-review everything and they just hired an external firm to audit their code and tech docs. They have started from scratch (coding in Haskell) to avoid some of the scaling / speed issues Bitcoin has to overcome via Lightning, etc.

Definitely not when it comes to other coins using Lightning. Atomic swaps will give more utility to coins like Litecoin / Vertcoin / Monacoin, etc.
It will make services like ShapeShift obsolete when trading between those coins.
It will also make bcash even more obsolete as it will be shut out from using any of these features.

This is so slick. Everyone should try it out.

You left out the part about Brian Armstrong delaying implementation of SegWit to put further stress on the network, and ensuring none of his employees would leak info about his sneak attack.

Ok, I'm guessing you're Elizabeth Stark, Janine, or maybe Oprah Winfrey.

You wouldn’t need a separate channel for everyone you transact with. You open a channel and can hop between channels to transact with whoever you want.
In practice you will essentially always have a single lightning channel open and buy everything you want to buy from whoever you want and you can also receive funds yourself.
It’s not as if you will need one separate channel for your coffee shop and one for your clothes shop which you need to open and close all the time. You can send and receive funds between anyone on the network as long as you can connect to them by hopping between different channels.

Try on the phone app, and on your computer’s web browser.
I remember there was some broken JavaScript on one of the photo submission forms and it wouldn’t submit properly. I don’t remember if I switched to computer or phone but I remember only one would work.
Edit: Also try through both the gdax site and the Coinbase site.

[This video]( from a guy called Kenny has some pretty sound advice.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:48:31
Thanks for this. I'm testing the beta now.
By design, when should the app request a pin to unlock the wallet?
I noticed that after it's unlocked I can minimize the app and sleep / wake the phone and the wallet will still be unlocked. But we can manually lock it from the menu.
Just wondering if this is by design, or a bug, and is there a timeout?

Jesus dude. No one expected you to go through with this. :(
It's just the Internet. You could have just made a joke video. Respect for following through, but that much blood loss is not healthy. Go to emergency immediately!
I don't think I can ever unsee the way the juices oozed out from between your teeth when you bit into it. :-(

Yep, don't want people to start posting too early.
But when it does happen I'm hoping someone out there has been working on the ultimate over 9000 video including:
crazy dubstep, Jihan getting triggered about bcash, Oprah saying "9000 penises", Roger Ver crying, I'M 'A FIRIN' MAH LAZER!!, Kazoo Kid, and a whole lot more.

I'd watch out. Roger Ver is a master of economics. He regularly uses complex terms such as "opportunity cost" and "economics".

I can already see him waking from a Bitcoin-themed fever dream in sweat-soaked sheets.
