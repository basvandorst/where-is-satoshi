Man reddit has made me snort a few times today and your comment was one time.

As the old saying goes, “as long as you’re comfortable losing the amount, you can invest it in Bitcoin”

For every person that bought some amount at $10k and sold at $100k, there will be someone buying some at $100k to sell at $1MM. I’m not here to say these numbers will actually happen, but this is how investment/speculation works. Price itself doesn’t matter as long as the market is healthy and new buyers are coming in.

The cool thing about the financial markets is that there's no such thing as wrong reasons. There's only ending up with more money or less money.
Good luck to ya.

Read up on the concept of arbitrage as it pertains to currency trading.
It’s an interesting topic.

We are living in a world where a post of this type gets rewarded with reddit gold and silver lol

You’re not wrong. DCA smooths out volatility, but your right that lump sum maximizes gains in cases where the price is going consistently up.

I hear you. I’m sure you’re a smart guy, but taxes, fees, imperfect entries/exits, and mistakes will wipe you out with that strategy over time, and maybe not even much time.

This volatile up and down pattern has played out in BTC over and over for about a decade now. That combined with the fact that many people believe in the future of the tech is a pretty compelling story, to be honest. 
Past results are not indicative of future performance, of course, but the greater story does seem to point to rising value. 
People believe that Bitcoin is undervalued. I think that’s a pretty obvious answer to your question.

Yes. But there is a BIG difference between investing $1000 at $5/BTC and $100/BTC. Big. 
If it’s at $100/BTC today and drops to $5/BTC over the next few months, I’d love to be able to DCA between $100 and $5 rather than take it all at $100.

“I’ve gotten ridiculously lucky with my timing” at the beginning of your comment is the right mentality to have. 
“So next time Bitcoin goes vertical I’m going to day trade it...” is a nice way to turn that previous good luck bad. You don’t know the tops and bottoms until long after they’ve come and gone. 
Wish ya the best, but be careful.

I don’t think he’s saying that. Most people aren’t going to dramatically shift their investment allocations in order to make lump sum investments of any kind, let alone speculative cryptocurrency investments. 
I believe Bitcoin will be an important tech in the future, and I also believe that its value will rise. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to somehow empty my 401k, IRA, emergency fund, and HSA funds in order to invest. 
Most people aren’t sitting on huge piles of uninvested cash at any given moment.

I got you. As I understand it, your strategy is 100% spot on, particularly when the market is consistent in direction and not as volatile.
With Bitcoin, going all in when the price is at a temporary high could be a bad way to enter compared to some form of DCA. I need to build a spreadsheet to play with these numbers.
