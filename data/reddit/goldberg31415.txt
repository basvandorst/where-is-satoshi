ETH chain is moving more money than BTC.
So much for "no one is using them"

Yes both are crashing into identical scaling problems and ETH is only marginally more efficient due to few reasons but they are not visible in the big picture.POW chains are hard to scale without drastic changes to them

Without Jobs he would not create a working business and just give away apple 1 at 0 profit and never raise capital to make Apple2 happen.

Also he is not a bear with some solid reasoning behind his position he is just a permabear about everything that is not a precious metal.

Is it really interesting?
For decades in the eastern block and years of transformation in the 90s black markets used USD to circumvent the state controll over trash currency of socialist disaster that this system creates.This happened even when owning USD was punishable even with death.
It is not a popularisation due to convenience or superiority of btc system but due to totalitarian failing state of Venezuela

How is friendster and myspace doing or altavista ?
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:20:57
And this is the problem.People don't treat it as a payment system but as a speculative asset with only goal in mind of selling for a higher price later on based on more people buying btc for the same reason.

It is a another note in long history of black markets.When it comes to the widespread adoption of non conventional banking systems it would be more interesting to look into China mobile payment market and especially African mobile banking.
BTC sadly has many flaws and discussion about these on the web is inversely proportional to exchange rate gains and hard problems like  scaling are pushed aside by moon mission posts and similar stuff.I am into crypto since before the first bubble and best discussions we had either in ancient times or when no price action was taking place so people were focused more on tech and not on lambos and gainz.

Yes but discussion of solutions to scaling problems are not in popular forums and sadly often whitepapers of tokens but in math and CS papers because of how complex problem this will be to solve

The end of petro$ and other stuff?
Another endless internet conspiracy theory economics with PeterShiff being one of the more popular proponents.Btw how is that hyperinflation doing that these people were predicting since 2008?
Balance sheet of FED is an issue but not world ending one.
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:39:06
You know what never happened ?
hyperinflation $ collapse and gold at X  
 
And what happened? DOW 20 000 and 5% unemployment and low inflation.
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:52:30
lol how is that gold doing since 2011 ?
Goldbug mania of last decade should be long dead but there are resistant people that hold on to an unproductive asset that lost 50% of the value in last few years
