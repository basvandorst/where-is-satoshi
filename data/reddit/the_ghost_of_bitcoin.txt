Honestly as an autistic person there is something appealing about cryptography. It's like freakin number magic.

Except it's not really up for debate what the name is.  It's not called Bcash.  The name is Bitcoin Cash whether you like it or not.  That's what it is listed as everywhere.  There is no coin called Bcash.  Refusing to call it by it's name is just confusing and clearly provocative.

I haven't seen anyone use Bcash and not proceed to say something negative about it. You know what you're saying isn't true.

They are technically both Bitcoin though...

That may be true, but you're certainly the minority.  If you are teaching people about Bitcoin Cash and refuse to use the full name that's where the problem comes in.  If you and your friends call it a nickname like Bcash among yourselves I don't think that's an issue.

Perhaps my verbage was not optimal, but the purpose of language is to convey meaning and I think what I intended to communicate was unambiguous.

Not at all, they even serve an important function.  They are just grossly overpaid for the actual impact they have.  
I found an interesting article ([ with a quote related to this:  


It seems that the positions on the C level tend to have a lot less direct detriment when they simply aren't there than the lower paid jobs.  If we suddenly had no janitors or administrative assistants the impact would be much more noticeable, to the point the business can no longer function.

That's also true of a CEO position so what is your point?  In fact, the productivity of the lower level worker is required for the function of the company where management positions are not (at least not directly).

I've never used linux but I'm generally pretty good with tech stuff, I'll give it a shot on an old laptop since this seems like great advice.
