there are 2 bitcoin futures markets. CBOE &amp; CME. together, there is one futures contract settlement for EVERY 2 weeks (cboe is always first, then follows cme)  .  but do not let you psychologically influence by this shitty USDollar settled contracts! they are totally irrelevant to cryptomarkets since settled in USD! the whole damn market just panics without any reason! you can check contracts here : 
you guys have to understand: the big boys and banks have maybe not so huge notionals in the futures. but it does not matter! because the futures by themselves have NOTHING to do with bitcoins price since they are solely traded and settled in USD$!!! its just people like rabbits panic and psychologically look at the damn futures prices instead to ignore them entirely and trade as ususal at standard crypto exchanges and believe in crypto's future!
and the banks manipulate the prices not by the futures! the futures are just their legitimate "reason" -&gt; they buy actual bitcoins BEFORE they enter the futures contracts. and after a month when the contract is due, they start huge sell orders of their already owned bitcoins! so at the end the bitcoin price falls dramatically, so that their futures contract gets settlet in the win-area!
but they should not be able to pull this off! they got lucky with other news fro china and korea coming at the same time . crypto people must believe in crypto future instead of investing shortterm in damn shitcoins valued at pennys! there are 2000 coins, time to do research and invest in valuable coin ideas! and then such panic will not happen!
stupid people believe the crap in the media and let them psychologically influence. when the FACT is clear that crypto WILL be the future! all the new banks in japan getting crypto licenses, switzerland, USA, germany, major g-20 countries legalized already bitcoin and crypto ! if it would not be legal, they would not be able to collect taxes on them (you have to get that regulation is good!)! its a done deal, crypto will stay! just get rid of the penny-coins and copycats, and stay in the ones with practical usecases!
"The amount of money waiting to come in makes a prolonged bear market close to impossible. EVERYONE that matters is looking into crypto right now. And it is really everyone."

why not one news outlet mentions the fact and possibility of price decline influenced by the first bitcoin futures settlement date on 17 Jan on CBOE?!? price declined EXACTLY one day before that sharply. coincidence??
