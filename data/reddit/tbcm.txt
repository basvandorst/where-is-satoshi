What program is this? I once had a transaction sitting there during four days until it was confirmed.

I received 0.9BTC from them to try out their service, which cost me 0.8885BTC. Do you consider that "paid"?

Thanks for the links. They are really useful. I should have made a better job saying from the beginning that they only sent me the bitcoins needed to try out the service and that they kept the Amazon code I received once I had finished my test.

That's true. I can't prove otherwise because I don't want to give out my real identity online.

This is a great service! I wrote a review of my experience using AmazonBitcoins here -

They are from the NetLookup.se faucet. I think someone donated a tiny amount and all the unpaid bitcoin addresses they had stored got a satoshi. I uploaded a screenshot to my blog

I see your point but I don't agree with it. To me, "paid" means I earned something for doing the review, and I didn't. Do you consider "paid" every review ever made by journalists at meetings or conventions who were allowed to test unreleased products "for free"? Bear in mind I didn't redeem the Amazon code I received; the administrators kept it.
Also, I don't care whether people try the service or not - that's up to them to decide it after reading my well-documented review - since I won't earn anything from that. Personally, since Amazon doesn't deliver products to my country I won't ever use their service.

Sorry, this is the first time I submit a link. What details am I supposed to give? Everything is explained on the link.
@_date: 2013-02-20 15:57:34
The system doesn't allow me to submit anything else because I got negative votes on this text post. So here goes the link for whoever is interested:

I'm a noob and made a text post instead of submitting a link. Sorry. I'll try again.
@_date: 2013-02-20 17:15:19
It's the first link I submit and I didn't read on Reddit's terms of use that you couldn't link to sites which had ads. Sorry for my mistake. It won't happen again.

You are welcome! :) Still, don't you fear somebody will make a bot that creates random Twitter accounts and sends the tweet once from each of them? Have you thought about that?
