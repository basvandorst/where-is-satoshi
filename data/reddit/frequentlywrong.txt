Are you sure he is your friend? That does not sound like one.

I would be very hesitant to have any larger amount of money in a bank. A major crisis is coming (larger than 2008) and as the cases of Argentina and Cyprus demonstrated, the governments will take money from the people directly if they see no alternative.

Chinese shadow banking sector is in trillions.

World peace would be nice as well.

But they do. The government manipulates inflation numbers to hide it. The formula they use uses items where it shows up the least. The actual USD inflation is a multiple of the official number. Remember that inflation is great for the government, it makes their debts worth less. It's terrible for the population, but who do you think they care about the most. Themselves or the people?
Why do you think minimal wage workers have to work 2 jobs and still can't earn a living wage. This was not the case in the past.

Because it brings page clicks.

Create a new currency that is backed by bitcoin and print it. Then you offer a fixed exchange rate for a certain period of time. 
You now have a currency much like a gold standard currency. Except that it can be exchanged for bitcoin instead of gold.

And who will pay for it? If the USD loses reserve currency status, the entire US economy collapses with hyperinflation.

Because bitcoin is a bad store of value.

Money printing is actually just a figure of speech. It's not actually printed money. Just numbers in bank accounts. But that fact is irrelevant. The effect is the same. That money is staying in the financial sector and creating giant bubbles.

They can shut down bitcoin exchanges (you need a bank to get to them). Leaving you with only local coins. They can bully merchants to stop using them (over the counter at least). They can outright make it illegal thus moving all bitcoin apps away from android/ios app stores (or just pressure google/apple to change policy and remove them).
They can't stop you from having them. They can stop you from using them for the vast majority of things you need. What will the price of bitcoin you can barely use anyway be? Not much.

They can do it in an instant and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Once it's gone it's gone.


That is a very optimistic view. The masses can be controlled, by propaganda or force. Governments now have a very well trained police for riot control.
It happened in Cyprus and it happened in Argentina. Are people from there any different than people from other countries? They took the hit because they could do fuckall about it.
It happened before and is likely to happen soon again. Quite possible it is going to happen in a major EU country.
The only thing that is certain is that we are in for some very very rocky times ahead. A global financial meltdown and/or a major war.

That sounds like an absolutely retarded idea. If you think you will be in any way better off you are mistaken. Unless your current situation is crap as well.

Of course they are. There are bubbles in everything at the moment because the FED printed ~3.5 trillion in the last few years. Total US dept (public and private) stands at about 750k per person. The situation is insane.

They could issue paper that is backed by bitcoin? Much like a gold standard currency.

Don't kid yourself. They can pass laws that effectively make using bitcoin illegal or at least completely infeasible. NY did or attempted to or something.

There is a group of people who basically control the world. Governments dance to their tune and if they don't they are toppled or key figures assassinated. Wars happen because they want them to happen. Intelligence agencies basically work for them not their governments. 
They are unelected, independent and largely unknown. They are bankers and their power stems from having a monopoly on the issuance of (fiat) money. That is the greatest power in the world and it is wielded by central banks.
Bitcoin comes along and is aiming to take away their source of power. Something they lied, killed and bribed to achieve. They will throw everything they can at it. Linking it to drugs and terrorism is easy and effective. If it does not work, it will be made illegal. They will almost certainly succeed.

They can get over 50% of hash rate computing power. They have the money. 
They can create laws that make using bitcoin useless or illegal for any business. 
They can hire hackers to fuck up exchanges. 
They can order banks to stop doing business with exchanges.

Not in the short term (year or maybe 2) it doesn't.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:28:38
Making it illegal makes it useless because you can't spend it with any lawful business.

So it's like SETI for bitcoin, but you make money from it?
