Give it a go. It's still almost 9 more hours to the planned fork (12:20 utc)

Go to settings → addresses and import private key there

where exactly are you from?
In Vancouver there are several bitcoin atms where you just put your cash in. 1% fee. Only the price seems to adjust in favor of the atm owner. Baught a small amount yesterday for 3340cad/btc when market price was around 3230 cad/btc. Checked today and the atm price was still above 3300cad/btc even though it dropped to 3100cad/btc everywhere else.

You could be right, if Coinify is only purchasing bitcoins to sell them again for a fee. Please let us know when you know for sure

If you have your private keys, you're fine. All chains share the same history, so if you got them before the split, you own them on all chains. Just don't move them after July 31st, not even between adresses you own.

Everyone gets coins on both sides. The problem is using a wallet/exchange that doesn't support both chains. By spending it on one chain you could unwillingly spend the same coins parallel on other chains as well and lose them.
The idea is to save your private key and wait until the dust settles. Then spend it with a wallet that supports all existing chains.
You know your keys, so in theory you shouldnt have any problems. The thing is, coinbase has them as well and they just support one chain. They could potentially spend the coins they don't support, who knows, so the best way is to make sure that noone exept for yourself knows your private keys, especially when coinbase cleary states that you should withdraw your coins, if you desire to access uahf coins.

I have the Sennheiser 598 CS. I definitely like them, but I wouldn't call them magnificent. 600$ headphones are in a different league. I tried the Sony MDR-1000x (~350$) a few days ago and am now thinking about getting them. Would place them somewhere between great and top notch.

I don't use coinbase so I don't know exactly how they manage the coins. If they do like you say, they won't be able to do anything.
I was referring to normal Coinbase usage, not the vault . They don't generate an adress for every single buyer. All the coins are stored in a few adresses and you only purchase a claim on the coins until you withdraw them, so Coinbase is sitting on thousands of coins and won't let the users withdraw from the uahf chain, so what else are they gonna do?

Electrum f.e. uses a 1626 word dictionary. That means there are 1626^24 possible seeds. To randomly guess one out of the ~18mio existing wallets, the chance would be 1:6.48*10^69, which means even the fastest computer on earth would need 2'210'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 (2.21 * 10^45) years to count through the possible seeds for the first wallet.

Looking at it like this, doesn't that mean in case of a credit collapse fiat cash would be much better than bitcoin, because of it's sudden deflation?
