Realise now posting a rally cry for the unconverted was not best conducive to discussion about this idea. So here is project outline below from  -
Create an anarchist libertarian communist cryptocurrency and socialist counter-economy.
How it works:
Antok is an open-source platform for anybody to setup local assemblies that can be joined by members and collectives. Serving as an organisational and resource management utility governed through direct-democratic voting procedures and bottom up hierarchy structures. Participating collectives operate in a non-profit or anarcho-syndicalist manner. Contributing any profits (after wages) to local assemblies for community control and allocation decisions. Each member is assigned a token granting equal access to goods and services and facilitating trades.
-Member and collective registrars  
-Property, goods and services registrars  
-Direct-democratic and bottom up hierarchy structures and voting platforms  
-Resource management and automated distribution allocation tools  
-Token system that ensures equal access to essential goods and services and can facilitate trades  
-Transparent anarcho-syndicalist processes and community control of finances  
-De-centralised and autonomous management mechanisms through local assemblies  
Project status:
This is currently a solo project in planning stage. Eagerly welcoming all contributions from experienced developers and any others with useful skill-sets and ideas. Please email me at antok and join the GitHub project page. I have also setup a discussion forum and will post social network and blog links below and update them with news and promotional content. Also laid some barebone functional requirements.

Was asked by mods to re-post linking directly to content rather than antok subreddit. So in interests of generating further discussion, here it is. I've also updated blog to highlight technical talk so far and planned project progression -
