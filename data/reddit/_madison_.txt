You can do it, but you cannot then claim you have 'good risk assessment' because you don't. You would get fired for behaving like this at something like a hedge fund. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:22:55
Risk management is about minimizing losses not making money. 


Hence why i said 'Any moron can make gains in a bull market'.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:13:18
What does this pointless ramble have to do with anything? Being poor means you should be even more careful with your money and certainly not putting 20% in high risk assets as you cannot afford to lose it. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:11:54
Any moron can make gains in a bull market, good risk management comes into play when the bull run ends, things get tough and the over exposed get wiped out. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:01:01
You would have to be a complete idiot to take your salary in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:16:01
You shouldn't be confident in your risk assessment. Sticking 20% of your savings in an asset this volatile is retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:58:24
The loan will be high interest so the cost will be growing at a fairly high rate. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:57:13
He has only admitted it was dumb because the price went down. This was a completely retarded idea even if the price had risen as the risk is so high. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:25:50
If only there was some highly regulated system to let you spend money online or just keep it safe in an account. Guess we can only dream for now.

Tell that to the guys in Guantanamo bay, they will tell you how much governments respect 'law'
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:56:04
That would only apply if Apple had a crypto currency themselves
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:03:12
Yep this 100% won't happen again due to the lack of any sort of regulation.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:49:46
All US economic output which is taxed and forced implementation by US law by the US government which control the Police, Courts and Military. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:09:26
He's not wrong though 8% on withdrawals is a lot.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:10:03
Try paying your taxes in Bitcoin then see what happens.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:33:28
There is no regulation so there is nobody to check or administer penalties. This is the bad side to independent crypto currency that everybody forgets when things are going great.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:20:21
Well the story here is that the Bitcoin market is deregulated and so fuck ups like the one at MtGox can happen with no safety net for customers which is a real problem. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:29:13
Well this is the problem. At the moment the Bitcoin service is very competitive compared with Fiat, as you said its a convenient service and it can be used internationally without being subject to tariffs etc. The problem is it operates in a market it has no control over because nothing backs it, the US government could easily make Bitcoin uncompetitive through charging tariffs through taxation or something similar. I think its a great payment service especially as i said for international trade but as soon as it even looks like its competing with the US$ the government will tighten the screws. 
As some have said its possible the MtGox coins were frozen my the US government and Mark has been told to keep quiet. Any nations government can do that because again Bitcoin has nothing backing it. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:02:07
If people had total freedom then most would not bother paying tax like the Greeks did which would quickly be followed by economic chaos and the collapse of all state services. Great idea.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:47:25
Governments have assets, land etc and an economy that generates wealth which back up currencies. The US dollar is backed by the output of all the factories, farms etc. A government that can imprison you and that has an army, a real world entity. Its fake money because at any second the government could turn the law against it and that would be the end of it, Bitcoin has no tangible entity behind it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:30:51
Unless the US Government does not see them as legitimate funds, this is a possibility. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:07:09
It won't be easy but mainly they will do it by absolutely fucking you if they discover you have not been declaring it much like they do with cash and capital gains now. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:12:52
'All transactions to US firms in encrypted currency are now subject to a 20% tax' Something like that would kill off Bitcoins use by business pretty quick. The government can do that really easily if it wanted. Bitcoin would be legal but it would be made totally uncompetitive vs the Dollar and so its use would fall. Bitcoin cannot do the same back, it has no management or government to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:55:50
That's the joy of an unregulated currency, anyone can set up an exchange and build a fancy website. Its why i keep the tiny amount of bitcoin i have in paper wallets, i regard all exchanges as being run by total morons in their basement. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:50:58
Did anybody go after the goldman sachs etc who lost all that hedge fund money? Nope. Any criminal organisations will likely murder the guy who suggested using bitcoin and that's it, anything more will just bring them under a police investigation.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:45:58
In this case those consequences are beach front properties and fine women.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:48:43
Why would he show remorse? People were stupid enough to give their savings to an unregulated company, this guys smart but i agree he should just shut up and never communicate with the bitcoin community again.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:05:04
No I don't think he did, I think his plan from the outset was to get rich and he's rich. Its the perfect crime, the very nature of bitcoin means there is nothing that can be done to trace to coins to the 'thieves' . Its clear this exchange was set up predominantly so they could siphon off coins and then run, its genius. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:14:23
It is fake money, its not backed by anything tangible so in that way it is the same as WoW gold or SL$ which you can also trade for hard currency. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:56:52
No it isn't. If they can't get the money from an account they will just send a sheriff to take things like your car for payment instead plus fine you extra. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:09:08
That's their fault for leaving it with an unregulated financial 'institution'. Its a monumentally retarded decision on par with storing your bank balance in paper notes in a paper bag suspended over a fire. He also didn't 'lose' the money they have blatantly stolen it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:22:33
What? Prominent people who screwed up were all over the news for years! People like Bernie Madoff, Lloyd Blankfein (both Goldman sachs, Blankfein as CEO), then you have people like Fred Goodwin and other bank CEOs. Goodwin had his Knighthood publicly revoked i don't know how much more publicity you want! You need to pay attention to the news more, all these public faces were seen in court many times and taking large retirement packages whilst the financial system crumbled, they are the ones responsible for people getting their houses foreclosed yet they are fine, Mark will be just peachy.
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:30:16
The customer might feel the investment firm is run by a bunch of retards and not feel good about giving them control of their life savings. Honestly i would think twice if an employee spouted insane shit like this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:33:00
It was probably a trick whilst they raided MtGox and took possession of everything.
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:09:34
It's shoddy as hell, main reason i would never get a modern car in black it shows so vividly. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:16:10


One circle jerk involves people losing their savings, the other involves people pointing out you will lose your savings. Pretty easy to see which one is superior. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:43:29
No you pay 1% so you can avoid all those pesky banking fees! Its the future you see.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:45:09
I'm interested mainly for the spectacle. I learnt about the tulip bulb craze but never truly understood wtf was going through peoples minds during it, now i get to read responses from buyers whilst it's happening again. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:50:21
Agreed. Once a real drop starts there will be no way to cash out at all, it's going to be a bloodbath. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:57:34
Why the fuck would you not cash out at least a percentage? That's completely retarded. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:43:09
It's the other way round. The price crash is making them move their coins out of exchanges because if the drop is too bad those exchanges are going bust. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:40:03
If it does you can buy back in and maybe at worst you lose a few bucks vs it falling further and you falling into the red. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:04:53


The fact you even need to ask if this is legit shows you need someone more capable to be looking after your finances.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:18:10
Well you could have collected more BTC then selling a few days ago and then buying back in. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:32:31
This is deranged. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:28
Read my comment again. I don't think BTC is dead but equally you are not going to get the same hype and rates of increase we saw in the run before Christmas, i think if you see gains they will be over the longer term. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:37:32
You could have cashed out days ago and buy back in, why are you celebrating making terrible decisions?
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:16:41
Honestly i think this fall is BTC 'recovering'.  The price is readjusting to a more reasonable level after the speculation bubble fucked about with it which is great news if you want to see BTC becoming a viable currency. I'm still not putting any investment into any of them until i see serious stabilisation which will take months for sure. 
I agree crypto and the block chain tech are both here to stay in some form but im not convinced BTC itself will be. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:18:41
I dumped everything at about $15k too. I just got so uncomfortable as it was clearly in some sort of mania phase and as you say it was obvious as hell the insane rise was unsustainable. I think greed has blinded lots of people on here and they are unwilling to accept the party is over. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:33:54
Honestly I think that has already happened. Certainly the hype phase is over, i don't think BTC will be worthless but the run of months at stupid gains are over. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:04:16
You will do in the commodities market, they are surprisingly regular but i never manage to spot the bloody things until they are already well underway. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:02:29
Hype and the ability to make large profits fast. Same as any other bubble. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:50:57
Ignorance of the law is no excuse especially when it comes to financials. Crypto nick is in big trouble and rightly so, if you are going to produce content like he did make sure you are read up on all the rules and regulations.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:41:06
Falling price is the worst thing possible for BTC adoption. As a business why would you accept payment for goods in BTC when the value of that BTC will fall below the goods fiat value before you can cash out. 


This will never happen, if you can trade it you can make money. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:52:35
You got greedy then. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:09:27
This is r/cringe material. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:44:50
The macro was extremely obvious though. The kind of gains we were seeing pre Christmas were unsustainable and that's what scared me off. 
You are correct you can't predict the details, i had no idea if the peak was going to be 20k or 50k etc but the situation became just so crazy i couldn't justify holding any further. I also couldn't justify the price, if someone came up to me and wanted to sell me a Bitcoin in 2012 for $15k i would never buy it yet here i was now holding that exact same asset at that price. At that point it was obvious the situation was out of control and being fueled purely on speculation and hype and the best move would be to realize the insane gains i had made, be happy with them and play it safe. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:22:05
Well the market is correcting so we will find out in a week or so. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:44:41
Have you cashed any of those 1,000% gains out? I dumped all my BTC at $15k because it was getting stupid now i have cash to buy back in instead of holding a depreciating asset. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:16:46
It's mainly credit cards so it's not 'your money' it's the banks you would be spending and it's been judged too risky. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:32:01
For Federal crimes the minimum criminal responsibility is 11 so they can hit him with charges just fine. 
Nick's youtube channel generated lots of revenue as it had 200k subscribers, he also received a large amount of money from 'referral fees' and i imagine his downstream was quite large so he certain profited a large amount of money from promoting the scheme. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission will come for this money, they do [target promoters]( if the damage they did was large enough which is certainly the case for Nick. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:06:51
Why the fuck are you not selling and guaranteeing a profit? You can always buy back in as the price falls further wtf are you doing?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:28:42
I sold at $15k because i didn't feel BTC was worth more than that. The market may have thought it was worth more but I was just too uncomfortable with the situation and decided to get out. 
I had no idea where the top was going to be but for me it had gone beyond the point i was happy holding the investment and it's important not to let greed cloud your judgement. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:41:11
I imagine they are already seeing existing clients getting wiped out and missing payments and want to prevent the problem getting larger. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 12:33:17
Maybe you should stop working for such a deranged employer?
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:30:20
Nope, you can lose by trading different cryptos and racking up a large tax bill. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:21:06
This is a terrible advert. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:51:54
How is that bad? You kept your head and banked a profit, that's good investing. Getting caught up in mania could easily end in disaster. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:59:47
Time to cash in before running off. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:49:32
Unless you had invested the profits then after 20 years you would have gained quite a bit. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:31:54
That only mattered when bitcoin was worth anything. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:56:05
Then people would use something else, you cannot run an economy on such a wildly fluctuating currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:50:18
Dollar outperformed BTC over the last year. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:54:19
I saw a steam train the other day. Steam trains will not go away so that is a bullish sign that we should all invest in them. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:14:50
As a currency its fucked, who in their right mind is going to have any confidence in a currency that drops half it value overnight?
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:17:08
Actually that's a fair point, steam trains were useful. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:52:37
Banks have insurance so if your account gets hacked you don't lose your savings. Plenty of Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and there is no insurance safety net there so you lose everything. 
In fact I'll bet more people have lost money through Bitcoin exchange hacks than hacks of all the worlds major banks combined.  
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:50:26
I think not buying a plummeting asset is smarter. There are so many better places to build wealth right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:17:15
well it was a lot of money 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:26:44
Imagine if you had put all that effort into something productive. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:52:15
Nobody with any sense is going to still have any confidence in Bitcoin whatsoever so it's doubtful its ever going to be that valuable again
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:03:55
These people are very stupid. I too am surprised they actually exist.
