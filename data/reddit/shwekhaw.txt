The one I used had to scan driver license and there is camera too. May be they don’t report to IRS but I think information would be available to government agencies if requested.

IRS might want to keep an eye on this kid in near future.

How are the fees on Gemini? I moved to Gdax to avoid paying fees on Bittrex.

Youbit or YoBit? I never heard of Youbit. Looks like Yobit is still working

When someone destroy money, it does not really get destroyed. The rest of the holders get tiny bit each since supply goes down and value of existing coin goes up. So I consider this a donation to community. Thank you.

Where is that stolen bitcoins? There must be the address that is sitting in.

Well, Governments around the world use Gold reserve. Do you know how they mine gold? Forget about electricity they use to mine, save, protect and transport. Just think about effects on the environment, people and animal lives on earth. How much toxic chemicals they use. How many countries they destroy in the process of extracting the mineral. How many people have died or suffered. 
Now look at the bitcoin mining again with fresh eyes and be honest to yourself. If we could replace gold reserve with something like bitcoin, wouldn't you say it is good for the world overall?

I am not sure why coinbase adding BCH is positive for BCH after a couple of days of new cycle. Now many people have their BCH handed back to them. I believe many will be selling. I feel like it is all the downhill from here for BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:44:21
You just proved that we are now thinking only about trading when it comes to bitcoin since it is useless for small transactions. This needed to be fixed not today but months ago. Many bitcoin holders have lost values to alt-coins because of high fee congested network.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:19:11
It is taken care of by supply and demand. Less supply now so coins in your hand will be valued a bit more.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:26:45
People like to keep their heads in the sand as long as the price is going up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:06
This is like once in a life time chance to sell BCH at over 4000 or even over 3000
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:42:15
I just don't want it come too late. So around when next year will LN will be done and we will start seeing low transaction fees and faster transaction confirmations?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:19:49
Or you can give it to me and I will try selling for you :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:38:17
Why? I don't understand. We should be able to do whatever with our money. Is it a loan or what?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:36
Why they not started the trading? Some back channel deals going on?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:40:54
That's what bitcoin future is going to do next week. Wallstreet does not believe in bitcon. Tons of people are planning to short. Prices are going to come down hard.

No. I was asking about trading commission fees. Gdax charge 0% on maker and .25% on taker.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:19:12
Do they have a number to call? I do not see any phone # in their support page.

When will this stop....?
Can we just take a break for like 6 hours?  I cannot sleep otherwise. I cannot go to bed holding bitcoin and I cannot go to bed holding fiat in case this might go up to $20000.

There is not sell wall until 11000. Unbelievable. Sellers have given up.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:38:38
It went down 200 points in less than one min. Actually other cryptos went down as well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:28
Sellers have given up and joined the team buyers. LOL
No sell wall until 1100.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:48:29
I agree but this should be what we all want by the whole community, bitcoin as real digital currency. Did the bitcoin community decided to forget about using bitcoin as currency and keeping it just to store value due to scarcity? Or are we deciding going different route to get to same goal using side chains. Then why is it taking years to develop this? We would not be in this situation and also have tons of alt coins stealing market share from bitcoin if bitcoin has been progressing steadily.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:18:48


All major ones Bitfinex, Poloniex, Bittrex, Binance use/support tether (USDT). If this thing explode, this will take the bitcoin down 50% easily.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:54:22
I was just wondering why it is dropping this time without me buying.... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:35:23
The current situation is that transaction fee for 1MB is getting higher and higher. Bigger block would bring them lower transaction fee. I understand more transactions will fit in bigger 8MB block. But will total fee would be higher though? For miners, total fees for 2000 transactions with 500 satoshi transaction fee is same as 10k transactions with 100 satoshi as transaction fee. So I am not seeing they are going to make a tons of money more with bigger blocks. Also new players can come in the market if they are making huge profits.

I understand but each account on exchange have a unique address for ins and outs. This is unique address for my account so it must be somehow related to my account.

Tether order book still working. I would imagine Poloniex would put out statement before they do that.

Last time I check, I can buy my sandwich with that worthless fiat, not with bitcoin. People like you who have their heads in the sand is the reason I sell whenever the price is rising.

Believe me, there is news, we just don't know it. People who know are selling. 600 points in 20 min does not just happen out of blue.

It can’t be because I am still holding.

We all know how this is going to end.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:54:55
I am selling. I be back in after things settle down. Keeping hodling for me. Bitcoin will cease to exist where without you hodlers. So I genuinely appreciate for that.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:04:06
I was waiting for a 200-300 in price recovery to buy and this thing is not even bouncing much.

Which Chinese exchange do you watch? I been watching OKCoin and they are trading only about 150-200 less than Bittrex.

Do nothing. Mining bitcoin is not profitable. Anyone who tried that would know.

Coinbase took my money for $1000 when bitcoin was $3300. Now after one month, they say purchase was cancelled. Had to beg to get my money back and just got it back today.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:54:35
If you are going to move the coins to oversea exchange or wallet, do asap as well. You never know, Chinese Gov might make CNY only withdrawal option.
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:29:23
China cannot control bitcoin just by controlling miners in their country. Bitcoin network is much larger than China. Chinese government just don't want anyone moving money without their knowledge. So closing exchanges is a necessary step but shutting down miners is not. Even then Chinese miners seem to be on edge.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:27:41
The question I have is - can you reverse the payment sent with very low fee if it is never confirmed so you can resend with higher fee? Or can you raise the fee to have it confirmed? How do you do that?
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:09:17
I agree with everything except buying altcoins. While they may not be able to manipulate altcoins, altcoins prices go down if btc price goes down, so what is the point? And some of the altcoins have different kind of manipulations going on.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:15:00
This is like 10% drop within an hour time with not much of market fluctuation prior 24 hours. Something is out there making people panic.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:22:43
China has banned facebook since 2009. Google, Youtube, Twitter all banned somewhat.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:49:03
Working on it to keep it down or to bring it back up?
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:42:57
But they cannot hide their identity that easy. They have to show their face, ID, passport even to withdraw from the exchange. Then Chinese government will surely know how much the account holder has. A lot of people have to come up with fake ID and faces in next 45 days. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:02:39
Are they working to implement full exchange (including order matching and liquidity)? Atomic swap alone would not solve the problem of having to use third party exchanges. I am not sure how you can have full service exchange without having third party to act as an escrow.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:57:23
He said the similar thing with Amazon. And now he said he regrets he did not invest in it.

I believed him when he tweeted about banning exchange. But he has to start standing his ground. It is hard to trust someone who does not stand his ground if he believes he did the right thing.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:05:45
Can someone who is familiar with Chinese news channel tell me if this is credible news.  Is it like an article from the New York Times or something like from National Enquirer?
Does this has anything to do with current on going dip?
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:12:36
Well.. I did lose a bit but I am not going to be too uptight like you  that you can't even take a joke.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:11:17
uhh. may be Chinese are asleep? Bed time?
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:18:10


Yes it sounded like that. So they are saying that the chain backed by the most hash power (more hash power raises block difficulties). In this case, miners would decide the outcome for them. Coinbase has to stay with the chain it chooses, since they cannot switch back and forth. Miners can just raise the hash rate up (probably Segwit2X) right after fork and coinbase could be stuck with supporting SW2x chain? This does not make sense.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:30:11
I guess you sold all your coins at 2951, huh?

And someone says we are in bubble...
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:34:03
Well you still have to transfer USD to a bank account. And it is not easy to open a bank account in foreign country and wire money without the government noticing. 
I think Chinese should just visit foreign countries just to sell the coins. Or some of us can go to China with load of money and buy those coin cheap. I think I am now under NSA watch for money laundering :(
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:52:30
I can buy as long as you send me first. Believe it or not, I am legit.

@_date: 2017-09-07 22:17:31
Ya? Who in the right mind is going to do that in CA with high energy cost and 100 degree heat? You would make more money opening up indoor bounce house for kids.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:51:49
bitcoin gold fork is to scam and skim the top. It is nothing to do with mining. They just use it as an excuse. Whatever you mine with ASIC or GPU, economy of scale give mining farms advantage over individuals.

Just try to open account and found out that they do not accept an account from Texas which I guess recently seceded from the Union.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:19:20
If the news of Chinese shutting exchange is not true, why is the price not going back up? Looks like this is going to play out over the weekends.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:16:23
I see that they charge 0.75% for bitcoin purchase. But what about exchange rate? I cannot find anywhere on their site. Do you have to signup to see published exchange rate? Coinbase is just slightly more than Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:23:00
Same problem here too. I wonder anyone really accomplish 'buy the dip' thing. I wish I could add more money this morning but just not possible. There are a lot of hoops to go through buying cryptos.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:27:46
Ok so
 shows their CNY price
This chart  shows their USD price.
I do not think regular Chinese coin holders are allowed to sell theirs for USD, are they?
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:28:32
Sound good so where are the details?
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:26:52

@_date: 2017-09-18 19:57:32
It is not yours to keep so give it to me.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:54:49
Why? I do not see any problem honestly.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:50:22
Just market selling until it finds support level which might be much further down than current level. I would have sold if I have anything to sell. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:00:36
Why don’t we just ban anyone who wants to sell?
That’s a sure way to make bitcoin price Moon.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:42:06
It was scheduled maintenance. People panicked as usual?
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:50:34
What stopping big guys to do arbitrage trading? 2%-3% margin sounds like enough to make tons of money.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:55:30
People just do not believe Chinese government will stop trading. I guess we are going to come back here in October.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:50:35
I don't think the news even reached China yet cause it is night time there now and Chinese will sell more tomorrow when they wake up.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:00:53
Did you read the news before posting? I see nowhere it says  China has banned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:32:05
Hi Olga. I appreciate your answer but it just add to the uncertainty. I am just going to cash my coins out and sit on the side line until the 'forks appear stable'. Even then I am not sure it will be clear which one will be recognized as bitcoin until a few months down the road. All these bitcoin developers on both sides are playing with billions of dollars but they won't be playing with any of my money though.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:10:34
Next time as soon as I see someone declare ‘reversal’ I am selling all my coins.
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:26:34
You won't regret it. Buy back in after tax day.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:48:58
Weekly pump and dump by Whales.
If you follow the price move over this weekend, there was increase in price and volume just to create technical levels to trigger buy-ins. Then dump in short period of time.
