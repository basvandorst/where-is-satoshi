How was it a fight? We told you we were backed up, and you chose to wait for your shirt and received the merchandise shortly after. We are now offering refunds because we understand we have lagged behind and don't want to loose face with any of our clientele (we have many clients).  We're sorry that you have a personal vendetta against us... We hope to make everything right here shortly.

Thank you for being a vigilant member of our community Fussy. I will report back here when we are caught up on ALL our orders (may take a few days). Sorry we did not get back to your emails fast enough. I got the support email hooked up to my S3 now so I'll be replying to emails personally.

Hello Nymbot,
We have not received any emails from you regarding "cheap printing", we use quality printers that are based out of the United States and rarely get any complaints about our printing quality. 
Mistakes do happen sometimes, and we are happy to offer exchanges when mistakes do happen. As for refunds we are now offering full refunds to all our customers no questions asked. 
Please email support for a refund or exchange.

All of your suggestions are duly noted. We are already in the process of implementing a ticket system. We could have communicated this downtime a bit better, and for this we are sorry. Thanks again for your patience .

Fussy, Please check your email for your tracking number. Your shirt ships today. Sorry for the wait, and thanks for your patience.

We apologize for the delay in our reply. Recently we were are the Bitcoin 2013 conference and that ended up taking more time and resources from us than expected. We are offering all of our customers who have backed orders and don't want to wait for fulfillment full refunds for their purchases. Our only wish is to get current with all our orders and we are working diligently to do so.
If you would like to ask for a refund for your order please contact us at support
Thank you.

Frankros, your friend got all those likes AFTER the previous winner had already won for the month of April. Your friend is still set to win in MAY.. YES he is ALL set to win the $250 prize.... We already told him this on our Facebook page... We are planning on changing our voting mechanism as Facebook likes are easily manipulated, and allows fake accounts to come in and pump up the likes in a matter of minutes (much like what happened with your friends design....) Expect a more secure voting mechanism for the month of May...

We have spent tens of thousands putting all this together so we could scam you for $20? We are still a small team , and our resources are already stretched thin. There are personnel related issues that we are dealing with, but your approach of calling us a straight up scam is not only wrong but inconsistent with our long history within the Bitcoin community. We operated as BitcoinCloset for over a year before we did the redesign to BitPride... 
I myself have been involved in this community for over 3 years, and I am offended when someone on Reddit who had one bad experience disqualifies everything I do as a scam. I have plenty of people within the community who can vouch for me, as I have come through time and time again, and will continue to do so. 
If you want to take things up with me personally (CEO) please feel free to email me at any time. - brian

Hello Reddit we are not scamming anyone... We should be getting all outstanding orders their tracking numbers within the next 24-72 hours. We have been dealing with some server issues on our end (https: cert conflicts) and are now in the process of migrating Bitcoin Pride to it's own vps. We have fulfilled hundreds of orders already, and have been a strong ally to the Bitcoin community for over half a year now. Over the last week we have been flooded with orders (due to the Reddit advertisement and the bloomberg plug), and have been inundated with technical problems throughout this flurry. We apologize for the delays, and will be catching up with all our customers via email/telephone. If you have any direct inquiries please contact us at support

Fussy, we have been having problems with our server. This could be why we have not seen/been able to reply to your email yet. Our server migration is almost done. And when the site is back up we will get back to you personally and resolve the issue.
