To my understanding Tahoe-LAFS provides limited storage space depending on the resources of the publisher. Freenet provides limited storage lifetime depending on the number of accesses on the content. As such, Freenet is inherently equalizing among publishers, while Tahoe-LAFS requires providing resources before being able to publish - and that required act of providing resources ill make it easier to trace.

There’s a core feature both MaidSafe and Storj.io miss: Publishing without paying up-front. Publishing where the users decide whether something stays online.
That’s what you get from Freenet - along with a real friend-to-friend darknet (if you want to hide that you use freenet, you only connect to trusted friends) and a Web of Trust which has proven repeatedly that it works at stopping spam even in a completely anonymous environment. →

Freenet nodes are continuously routing data from other nodes. Ask my provider how he curses about my roughly constant upload bandwidth consumption ☺

Because a market does not need general routing. It mainly needs publishing of offers and payments.

why so? There are Python bindings to the Freenet Client Protocol and Openbazaar uses Python.

I looked into the source a few weeks ago and did some refactoring to make a port to Freenet easier (it’s just another DHT, controllable using Python which openbazaar uses), but I found my free time too limited to push it.
I would estimate that porting OpenBazaar to Freenet should take a week of focussed full-time hacking.

In a talk about Freenet, I included a comparison with other projects which might give insight:  (slide 7: pure routing networks are easy to break)
