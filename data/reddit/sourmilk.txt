Couldn't it just be done through coinbase?

I think you need to retake math. (i.e. basic addition/multiplication)
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:45:40
Im still so confused... thanks for the attempt, but I have no idea what to expect. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:32:40
No... not at all. This post is ridiculous... and it's posts like this that ruin this sub. It has 128 upvotes... most likely because no one even read the rest of the post... they simply just blindly upvoted it. 
I'm sorry, but I hate you.

Why are you being a cunt?
@_date: 2014-10-12 15:31:59
Or leave LOL out of it. It makes it seem like a 11 year old stamped it.

Your comment only linked a subreddit. Its not conversation,  its not "competition," its just spam.

Looks like a blatant rip-off of satoshimines - just not as good... but whatever ya gotta do to make your money. Good luck with your bitcoin game. Hopefully you don't get hacked!

The second point is one I make to friends all the time. They accept bitcoin but immediately create a sell order to exchange for fiat. The adoptions of companies accepting bitcoin using bitpay and other similar companies is in reality,  only hurting the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:28:19
And anyone from r/bitcoin can blatantly tell you to stop... because its annoying.

Im sorry, I don't hate you, kingcolex, I was speaking to the post,  not the poster.

You think google is going to release addresses of people? So they are just gonna say "fuck your privacy"? I think you have to be wrong here...

The original article was written 4 months before the one you are linking to.

Do you even know what bitcoin is... or how it works? To me it sounds like you have a pathetic life... so you come to subreddits you don't sub to, only to waste your day posting comments that make you sound like an ignorant fuck.
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:48:21
As the OP put, Bitcoin is a decentralized Autonomous Corporation... which is different than the standard definition of a corporation. Bitcoin was actually the first DAC IIRC.

When I was in college for digital art and design, I had to make a video that told a story about my life - that was the only requirement. Literally.... and I mean literally everyone else in the class got an A+. I used after effects and final cut to put together what i thought was a clever and creative story and my teacher gave me a D because my life lacked interest. Sigh. The life of an introvert.

Wouldn't it be the developers fault who didn't program the code properly to prevent sql injections? 
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:24:05
To fix something, it must be broken. All you did was change my example. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:20:38
Exactly. Saying its SQLs fault is akin to saying it's maths fault 2+2 doesnt equal 5.

I dont care about this past single year. My bitcoin is still up over 400% in the past 6 years. Pretty sure ive gained more purchasing power than you think you have. I guess ignorance is bliss?
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:07:14
I dont need to take out a loan. Nice straw man argument though. My bitcoin is still worth more than it was when I bought it! My investment has quadrupled.  Whens the lst time your bank account did that? I still have tons left and my purchasing power has only increased more. Remember when $0.69 got you a gallon of gas? Or how about when a soda was a nickel? Your dollar value is decreasing. Cost of living has gone up... but your wage has stayed the same. Can't wrap your head around that can you? Your dollar was once a well-performing investment... now its a tanking investment - and since its fiat, and nothing is backing it anymore, its more worthless than it ever has been. And its only getting worse.

Did you ever think that maybe you were getting several downvotes because your statements sound fucking idiotic? 
You basically just said you can't continue a debate because everyone thinks you're wrong. That means it's not a debate... it means you are wrong.
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:34:51
Downvoting because you think the other person is wrong is against reddiquette... not against the rules. Big difference. 
what does a non-digital crowd have to do with anything? You type out your whole response so no one can interrupt you. So that was the dumbest example you could hace used. 
And lastly... again, everyone disagrees with you - therefore not a debate. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:18:13
Yes. Its called an address book. Its been around since email came out.

Sounds like you know what you're talking about! You must be so elite that you feel like a king amongst the rest of us. Please... share your supreme knowledge of cock suckery so we may all take part in being a fucking tool like you.

I don't think you can put it any better. If he doesn't understand by now, I'd just move along because it seems as if he may not understand English.

What's your fucking point? Are you being an asshole or serious.... I can't tell. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:27:25
Sold is the word wrong with this sentence. You wanted to get rich quick, not invest in the future. You should stick to other things... bitcoin isnt for you.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:10:53
The simple answer would be to say, "that would normally cost $x USD, so when the project is completed, you are required to pay the equivalent." That way, it BTC goes up, it won't matter.
