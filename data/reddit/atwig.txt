No Windows client yet, should be out in the next couple of days.
After that you just get the client, register through that and away you go!

I don't think DRM is the (main) issue. I think it has to do more with countries laws regarding certain images / symbols in game.
For example: In Germany you are not allowed to have swastikas or other Nazi symbols in your games. You have to replace them with something else. For games like Wolfenstein, witch is literally about killing Nazis, they had to replace all their swastikas with a [custom symbol]( they made.
Now it's perfectly fine to own a copy of Wolfenstein in Germany but you have to get the specific German version if you are a German resident. All of the other blood, guts, gore, and dialogue are exactly the same (99.9% sure), just the symbols were removed.

There are infinitely more words than there are ASCII characters. If you have a password that's 25 characters long you, as an attacker, don't know how many (if any) dictionary words there are. You just know that it's 25 characters. This will take you an inordinate amount of time to brute-force even if you didn't get locked out after 5 bad attempts.
Example: Your password is 8 characters long and mine is 9 characters long. The worst case (trying all possible combinations) for your password is a factor of 256 (number of possible extended ASCII characters) weaker than mine. Now if your password was 32 characters long then its something like 256^32 possible combinations. But just because it's difficult for a computer doesn't mean it has to be difficult for a person to remember. 5 words, two of them made up (Go ask a toddler to make up a couple words for extra entropy) are super easy for a person to remember, but super difficult for a computer to crack. 
Now if you did a bit of social engineering before hand and figured out that the dude's password was "Like 4 words because it's easy to remember" then you can start using a dictionary attack where the sum of the characters is the length of the password.

Agreed if it gets compiled but the $('var') makes me think its JavaScript... (I hate JavaScript)

You don't need the or ( || ) operation though... 
The expression will be 
A) False || False -&gt; False
B) False || True -&gt; True
so you can do away with the first part. It is overly verbose and creates an unneeded operation to check the country AND THEN evaluate the or operation...

The entire point of Bitcoin is that you can trace the money back to the Genesis block. That's how you prove that "is your money". Showing up with 10 BTC means nothing if you don't have the complete history of each part of your 10 BTC.

Yes. Before the fork you have the coins.
Going forward from that you will have the coins on the right side "path" and the left side "path".
You use them somewhere that takes coins from the left side. They look back down the path and see that you have the coins from before the fork. You're good to go.
The left side doesn't talk to the right side in a "hard" fork like this so you can then go find someone on the right side to use your right side coins. They look back down the path and see that you have the coins from before the fork. They don't know if you've used them on the left side or not so you get to spend them again.
This won't work for "soft" forks as both left and right are still kinda holding hands and just trying to pull the other onto their path.

I've been going through roughly the same ideas as you, just a couple weeks sooner :P
My plan is to wait until all the pre-orders are finished and see how everything has balanced out then (Probs mid June, July) before I buy anything. 
Odds are I'd still buy one just for shits and giggles (And because it would probs still make up the cost of running my computer).

From a pure Raspberry PI standpoint it is possible to use a USB WiFi adapter as it has two USB slots. The only issue with this is if you want to attach a keyboard/mouse you have to unplug one thing (WiFi or Miner), or use a USB hub...
I suppose you could set it up for some sort of remote desktop viewing but then you are just making things complicated.

Man is trying to get money out of an ATM in Germany.
Man's bank is located in a country that just joined the EU.
Man's country experienced a minor economic destabilization when transitioning to Euros (or something along those lines).
Banks are in the process of figuring out a bail-out plan.
Until bail out is finalized man can only withdraw 100 Euros at a time, instead of the normal limit (whatever it may be).
Man gets in line 10 times to withdraw 1,000 EUR to give to OP for bitcoins so man doesn't need to go through this process ever again.
(I believe this is what happened) 
Ninja Edit: Or the dude can only withdraw 100 Eur at a time because he is not in his native country and the bank imposes a silly limit or something... Either way the important thing here is that the dude had to get in line 10 times in order to get at *his* money

That is true yes, however if the price of Bitcoin is going to continue to increase (as we hope it will) then he will actually be making more money in the long run if he leaves everything in BTC and just uses whatever FIAT he has to pay his bills in the interum. 
Think of it more like getting paid with stocks.

1. Build it on Newegg.com or something
2. Check bitcoinstore for parts you settled on
3. Compare prices, buy from cheaper place
4. ...
5. Profit...?

Wow! I didn't know this!
I may now have to look into it more... Which will now force me to buy a BFL miner... Thanks's OP... :/

Well... because you asked:
You are assuming that the USD/BTC conversion rate remains the same for the next 4-6 months yes? While not a "bad" assumption it's still an assumption.
Also moores law (if i recall correctly) only pertains to generations of processing power. Nobody is going to realistically mass produce and manufacture a new CPU/Chip if it's only 40% faster. Plus (as you can see with butterfly labs) there's a big difference between this chip can *probably* be 40% faster and this chip *actually* is 40% faster (in both time and money to make and produce these chips).
But otherwise I totally agree with you. If for some reason bitcoin has another huge spike and I am able to afford one based solely off of my BTC investment profits then like it will have cost me "nothing."

$275 ish,
5Ghash/s (or 5,000 Mhash/s) +- 10%
As a word of caution, if you order now you will be towards the end of the list so by the time you actually receive a unit it might not be as cost-effective as one would be now.
I personally plan on waiting until they finish all their pre-orders and actually have some in stock. Then I'm going to run all the math again and figure out how it'll take to pay itself off.

I think one of the safest ways to decide weather or not to invest in an rig or ASIC miner would be to plan everything around 1 BTC being $10 USD. 
If the difficulty jumps up around 20 mil (Its just under 3 million currently IIRC), and the cost of BTC is $10 USD and you are still "supposedly" going to make a profit then it could be considered a "safe" investment.
