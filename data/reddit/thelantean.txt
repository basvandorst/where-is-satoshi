Re-read my post. I said that with this treaty in place a government can't ask/require/force open and free code - two attributes that are extremely valuable in themselves. Asking for them gives Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) an advantage during a selection process. Not asking or selecting for them means those two pluses for Bitcoin evaporate and the incumbents get the upper hand.

One issue is that for a long time open source has been at an artificial disadvantage (and still is) because of anti-competitive business practices - like vendor lock-in through non-interoperable formats (enforced using software patents, DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions, or simply because of sunk costs), monopoly abuse, and straight up bribery thanks to the presence of higher capital. 
In this sense, open source and bitcoin have never been on a level playing field.  
Another is the social cost of continuing to allow closed source software, especially when taxpayer founded, for example:
 - price gouging and lost time since it hinders real competition
 - damage to the economy since it slows down deployment and thus slows down increases in productivity
 - cripples innovation since monopolies naturally gravitate towards stagnation
 - takes money away from the local economy 
 - work that has been funded with public money is not made available to the public (even though they already payed for it once), or worse - it gets locked up and forgotten
 - damage from security issues, since a closed, secretive atmosphere with the number of reviewers lowered by force is not a good environment to identify bugs. Same for regular bugs that hurt productivity. 
For a nice parallel, see the issue of open access vs. paywalled research. 
All this treaty will do is put even more money in the same old pockets at the expense of progress and society in general.

Possibly. Let's say one day a government that signed that treaty wants to upgrade the backend of their country's banking system/digital purchases to a more modern system. 
A crypto-currency using the block chain system (even if not Bitcoin itself) would be perfect for that, and for good reason, since:
 - the government would want the code to be open so that any company could maintain it in the future (if the original one goes bankrupt or wants extortionate prices when contracts are up for renewal) 
 - and also to be free (including patents) so any merchant can easily and cheaply implement it on their end -&gt; to reduce the barrier of entry to new businesses and spur the economy. 
However with this treaty in place a government can't ask for any of that. The incumbents (banks, Visa/Mastercard) would cry foul and force the requirements to be changed, otherwise they'll take the government to an international court (or even worse - to a private Investor-State Dispute Settlement tribunal) and force it to pay massive damages.
