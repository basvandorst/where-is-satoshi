The problem is Mt Gox believes we should be grateful to use their service, when its the reverse.  Oh well its just a matter of time until Gox dies from their own hubris.

He went to jail because they sold/shipped a bong(s) to a state where it was illegal.  I didnt read the case nor do i recall if it went to trial or he pleased, but i assume they had a way to prove he knowingly did it, or he was taking the fall for his son that they had proof on.

So while they did lure him into the trap he wasnt entrapped.  Seems like he could of said no.  While i think it should be legal i still think they where just being greedy and breaking the law.  Once busted though then attempted to make it come across as a weed related thing.

Mt gox.  The drunken boyfriend that hits you then claims he was drunk and it will never happen again.

But thats unfair.  You made it too broad.  He wasnt just making custom glass items.  He owned a site that was known to sell glass bongs and pipes, plus im sure on the site it states they will not ship to the following states.
So you need to add a line.
"And if you don't deliver the goods then they wont pay, but you know 100% delivering it is illegal since you post it on your company site you will not ship there since its illegal"

Hoarding helps the value stay when something is in its starting stages.  They just need to add a captcha to stop the bots.  Problem fixed.

These are being run by amateurs.  My sites have been hit by harder ddos.  All they need is either to consult somewhere like staminus, or buy some 12k cisco servers.

Yea i agree id say they could destroy the funds on creation.  Just offering suggestions to help keep price falls like this.

1. Wasnt there a big amount of coins moved just the other day.  That makes this a big coincidence.
2. What if the govt is secretly buying up a large stake in bitcoin to own a majority share.....

I want to see a graph showing how much someone who was an early adopter running theirs has made vs someone who buys one at this price.  Being an early adopter allowed you to mine coins as well before the diff got higher and higher.

But they would be non profit.  Also they would do this only to help the price stay.  If anything they could always just destroy the ability to get those coins back.  So by default the price would raise?

If the shirt was over priced it will.

Porn decided the format for videos.
Drugs(silkroad atlantis) will decide the format for money.
Currently silkroad does use bitcoin.  Until the black market changes what they use, bitcoin will have value.
