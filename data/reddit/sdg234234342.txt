I actually think this video could be an example of reverse ["damning with faint praise"]( a sort of "praising by faint criticism".. basically he says lots of positive things about bitcoin and one slightly negative thing (the intrinsic value argument - which may be true for the way existing money systems evolved but I don't think it follows that all money has to evolve that way - we've never seen anything quite like bitcoin before).

Well I think people will know when "the internet is down" in their area anyway.. it will be fairly obvious.

What would happen is that only one side of any double spent transactions would survive, the other(s) and any transactions using them as inputs would also be invalidated. This shouldn't be a huge problem - any legitimate transactions would eventually confirm as normal but if the network is split you shouldn't accept any payments from untrusted people - or any payments from trusted people where their input transaction is newer than the start of the netsplit.

Maybe except that it's not really easy to do that.. at least in a decentralized way.. maybe some centralized warning service would be acceptable though.
A large partition of the network is quite unlikely anyway as each node has different ISPs and connectivity it's probably quite hard for large regions to become isolated - individual nodes can obviously lose their connectivity but there are probably always going to be one or two nodes on satellies links or laptops on a train/plane moving in and out of the outtage zone.

Maybe.. again I can't think of a good implementation off the top of my head.. one thing you might notice pretty quickly is a massive increase in block confirmation times since you've now lost most of the hashing power.
I really don't think it's that big of an issue though.. if the internet is so broken that you can't connect to anything outside of your area I think you'll notice pretty quickly. If it's only slightly broken there's a good chance that bitcoin will still work fine because there will always be some nodes in your area that are connected to you or other nodes in your area and also have working connectivity to nodes in other locations.
