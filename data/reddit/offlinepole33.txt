When I 1st heard about Bitcoin I was amazed just by the characters and power it possessed. And most importantly it's decentralized. More and more people awakes to this beautiful money and started seeking for it in different ways. More and more people traded their $ for btc and slowly loose their interest in $.  Isn't this btc's goal when it was 1st created?. 
We the people only brought BTC to this stage and made it what is it today.  But now it's like democracy has penetrated btc. For some BTC is shit now!! Instead of fixing issues, opposition plots against it.  
"BTC is the mothership, all altcoins are just small boats crusing by it. If we loose the mothership we loose it all"

Your mate thinks of btc as Fiat currency. Btc is not backed by a printer and it's not possible to acquire 200 btc in 200days.

Dude Fiat currency is much more complicated to me, I hear it's backed by a huge printer and not gold. Money out of thin air ����.
