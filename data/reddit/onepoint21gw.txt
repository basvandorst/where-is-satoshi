Yeah, I thought that was the way it was always supposed to have worked too... (except in Australia where you have never been able to load up your Microsoft account with BTC) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:21:14
Hmm... Interesting, that you were told that. Hopefully that's the case then.
There's been a ton of posts on this topic over in since the ato page can be pretty cryptic (pun intended)  including a few accountants who specialise in crypto offering their opinions. Maybe see if or can chime in and offer some input as they seem pretty knowledgeable. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:08:35
I'm not an accountant, but the general consensus about this seems to be that it's only if you spend it directly for goods and services (and it's less than 10k) that you avoid CGT, if you convert to fiat you have to factor in CGT regardless of the amount.

They shouldn't seize your money, just declare capital gains tax on the whole lot so you're covered. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:32:54
Can't give you a definite answer sorry, but can't you just say you met someone on localbitcoins.com or Gumtree and paid cash. But again, that's nothing official, that's just my feeling. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:50:20
I thought it was less than 10k in a financial year? Not per transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:49:51
An example: buy a coin for 10k let's say in 5 years you sell that for 40k. That's a 30k capital gain that you have to pay tax on. Depending on your tax bracket and laws in your country about long term capital gains you might end up paying 30 percent of that 30k. You've still made a 20k profit.

+1 for quadrigacx. 
Once you set up an account (you don't need to be verified for any of this) you can send BTC to your wallet. 
Then you would exchange the BTC to CAD on quadrigacx and then do an Interact email transfer to withdraw CAD straight to your friend's email address which they can deposit straight into their bank account.

This is the same article that was posted in the Washington Post a few days ago. 
Still makes for an entertaining read though. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 04:07:28
Coinjar is another alternative I've used a bit, the only negative is it takes a couple of days for your funds to transfer from BPAY before you can buy.

As an Australian it saddens me to realise I just made the same mistake that is joked about across the world and mistook Austria for Australia.
In my defence though I really like craft beer and was a little too excited to see which state this was in. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:00:50
If you're in Canberra (and, who am I kidding, you're probably not) there are a couple of ATM's. One in Civic where I just bought $50 worth, and one out at the Turner lawn bowls club (that also sells Dogecoins)

In case anyone else was wondering (like me) PRNG = Pseudo Random Number Generator. 
Are you implying that creating the random seed on that phone is the same as someone else's seed. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:57:43
Thank you, 
So if I only buy a small amount and (unless it shoots through the roof in the coming years) then it shouldn't be an issue if I decide to sell and only make a small profit.
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:14:16
Gotcha, kinda makes a bit more sense now that I'm re-reading it, that it's just in relation to "assessable income." Rather than capital gains tax. Thanks 
@_date: 2015-05-27 01:59:02
Obvious question but how did you get the app on your phone? Via the Play Store, or from an apk? 
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:53:45
Just seeing what the general consensus is in the community. How many bitcoins would you own before you invested in a hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:19:40
Thanks, if I do end up investing it sounds like I'll need to get an accountant come tax time. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:49:27
You don't need a mobile number for 2 factor authentication. Sure, SMS authentication is one method but the more common way of using Google Authenticator doesn't need to use a mobile number. 
It's just a number sequence generator that changes every few minutes, created off a common seed at the time of setting it up.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:37:52
Thanks, so if I understand correctly then if I buy stuff with it under $10k then no capital gains tax, but if I exchange back to cash then I pay CGT? Or only if I exchange back over 10k worth? 
@_date: 2019-03-09 00:18:33
Neither does the Australian one. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:45:31
Coinjar or btcmarkets.net

Me too, I used weselldoges a lot a year ago. As I recall they had a small daily limit (Around 15 bucks) but it was perfect if you just wanted to get a small amount to start playing around with.
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:14:53
Which ones do you recommend? I've just always gone through Coinjar but happy to find an alternative. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:33:24
It also takes a few days to get verified. I believe they have to send a letter to your house. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:32:52
Cheapest you could do right now is about 10 cents, but that might take 6 hours to get there. If you paid 3 dollars it should be there in 5 mins 
@_date: 2015-07-25 11:51:58
Some Australian Credit Cards work fine. My Westpac one had no issues, neither did my friend's from their bank.
Though that was about 6 months ago so it might have changed.

You little rippa!

That has really been bothering me the last few days. I'm practically questioning random people on the street asking if it's "stein" or "stain"

Just reading about it all now. I always thought that MimbleWimble was coming to bitcoin, just doing some reading now and seems like that isn't the case. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:57:25
Haha, though he's actually been really bullish on crypto whenever he brings it up over the years. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:41:17
Quote taken directly from the source, he says "that is the rate of increase is accelerating"
Whether it's good or not would probably depend if you think it's sustainable if it keeps rising that way. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 05:48:42
Yet I still use Coinjar?! Man I need to find an Australian alternative. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 07:02:25
Thank you, I'll look into it. I've been using coinjar for the last few years without issue. And as much as I like to think people change, article like this leave a bad taste in my mouth.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:37:03
It's not a long segment, but it's about halfway through. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:47:13
Well, the S.A one I took from Wikipedia, but A.C.T is definitely decriminalized
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:53:43
A.C.T and S.A

I can't find the exact article in question, but it relates to this: 
Some of the other articles reporting on the same incident reported on it in a way where it sounded like the Prime Minister used his own money to invest in the bitcoin company. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:08:14
Yeah, that's on the next screen with commodities. That's where it was a couple of days ago and the presenter made a comment saying bitcoin should technically be on the currency screen. Then the next night it was. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:13:39
You didn't miss much if you stopped reading at that part.
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:42:22
Exactly, I was explaining to coworkers who were asking about how to store bitcoin after seeing it mentioned on the news. I was trying to explain how the seed words work and we had simular discussions. I suggested if you were paranoid, write a fake diary and have the seed words split across different pages. Though based on my seed words that'd be one abstract diary. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:33:49
Convincingly. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 09:47:12
You'd have to crunch the numbers to compare it to something like ozforex depending on how much they want to send to see if you'll save money.
I've sent money the reverse way. Bought with coinjar in Aus, transferred to quadrigacx in Canada, then used an interact etransfer to get it out. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 08:57:26
Honest question... What do you mean by golden ties? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:11:16
It'd would be nice if it became a regular thing. No idea what usually takes that 4th spot in the commodities, maybe wheat? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:45:08
I believe coinjar have a service where you can go into a newsagent and pay cash and they'll print out a code that you import into your coinjar account to top it up. Look for a newsagent that has the Ladbrokes sign outside cause it's the same system for if you want to top up your online gambling account. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:15:18
Yeah, I was only half watching while chatting to the wife so missed exactly what he was saying then saw bitcoin on the screen and did a double take. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:29:18
Heheh, snap.
