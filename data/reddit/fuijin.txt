This is what I don't understand... How are people not at least making a small killing by taking advantage of the arbitrage between exchanges?

What loose evidence are you basing this prediction on? or is it pure speculation

Coinbase is not the worst, but there are much better alternatives out there

bitfloor, btc-e, bitstamp

I never said coinbase was bad, just not preferable. The wide disparity between bid/ask prices, hard limits on new accounts, and the recent limits placed on orders are some of the things that come to mind.

I have a feeling we are still in the middle of a selloff, we can see the price dip below 70 before the day is over

I have used coinbase once, and I believe orders are fulfilled at market rate at the time of purchase per amount of bitcoin ordered

I would imagine the limit orders will be next to impossible to fill, and market sell orders will be filled at the highest bid price that is able to be executed, then downtrend from there until it reaches to similar levels of other exchanges
