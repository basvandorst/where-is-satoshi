Sorry, but I have zero respect for libertarians that have no fundamental idea what great progress we have made that they weish to remove. Until the 70s and 80s, many of our waterways and rivers were so heavily damaged by industry that it took the creation of the EPA to counter many of the environmental distaters down by companies.
You can argue against governments all you want, but without even minimal environmental regulations and market constraints, there would be absolute chaos and destruction. Business have no concernc other than the bottom line and the bottom line is profit. 
Still to this day, libertarians and tea baggers wish to erode some of the fundamental constraints on our country like emissions testing and clean waste disposal. Sure you can circlejerk around bitcoin day and night, but I don't see libertarians actually caring about you or anyone else. The Libertarian Party was founded by the Koch Brother and Koch Industries to eliminate regulations like the EPA in order to profit. What they are in a sense advocating is giving control to money driven, power hungry corporate entities. 
**EDIT 2:**  The Libertarian philosophy is the exact opposite of Communism. Both sound great on paper, both have sound theories... BOTH are terrible when executed. There needs to be a middle ground and Although you can argue pro and con for Libertarianism just as you could for Communism, it would have terrible consequences. 
I really enjoyed this discussion with everyone. I probably won't be replying all to much from her on out. I encourage everyone to read through all the comments as well as do your own research. Please don't just read what news outlets are saying or blogs. I would suggest reading actual academic research that doesn't sway you too far right or too far left. 
I would seriously encourage everyone to use [Duck Duck Go! search engine]( instead of Google and if you have to use Google, please use [Google Scholar]( There is a Buddhist teaching that I know called the Middlle Ground/Path/Way/Whatever:
* The practice of non-extremism: a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification;
* The middle ground between certain metaphysical views (for example, that things ultimately either do or do not exist);
* An explanation of Nirvana (perfect enlightenment), a state wherein it becomes clear that all dualities apparent in the world are delusory;
* Another term for emptiness, the ultimate nature of all phenomena (in the Mahayana branch), a lack of inherent existence, which avoids the extremes of permanence and nihilism or inherent existence and nothingness.
Edit 1: There are many fundamental flaws in which the Libertarian Party functions upon.
A. ZERO Gun control, they want to remove ALL restrictions, regulations and the selling and buying of weapons of ANY kind. Basically, they wish to open the flood gates to buying any and all weapons and ammunition. The problem with this should be obvious. Allowing any single person to buy any gun of their chose without any oversight results in a country with many more guns, than they need. Imagine gang members or radicals being able to buy any gun such as military grade snipers or fully automatic assualt rifles with no limits. Stockpiling guns and ammunition is akin to paranoia. 
B. The removal of Environmental Regulations. Having lived in countries with little to no environmental regulations like China and Colombia, I'll tell you first hand why this is bad. We NEED the EPA to protect our environment, and as things stand, they are insanely UNDERFUNDED, lacking any real power and in states where their power is twarted, you have chemical spills and coal ash dumps with no punishment as a result. Of course the Libertarian Party wants to get rid of the EPA, it's cheaper to dump chemicals in a lake or our rivers than to properly dispose of the waste. In parts of Russia, nuclear waste was dumped into the oceans by the thousands of tonnes. That area is now completely dead. Without the EPA, companies could begin pumping harmful chemicals into the atmosphere only adding to Global Warming. 
C. Education. Say good bye to publicly funded education. 
D. Labor. Say good bye to minimum wages, minimum standards of living and essentially adding to poverty. We must accept that we live in a SOCIETY, not in the deep neck of the woods isolated from everyone. As a society, we depend on each other and one way to keep a society afloat is through taxation. YES, TAXES (you must really hate me now). Unfortunately, we as a society expect the poor to pay taxes and let corporations and the rich get away from paying taxes. You, regardless of rich or poor have to use the same roads, the same highways and all of the same services in a society. As things stand, the poor are paying too much for taxes while the rich get to horde their money away in offshore banks. 
E. Healthcare. WE ARE THE ONLY INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY WITHOUT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. And we also pay the most for healthcare in the world. That's the free market for you. Insurance companies keep prices high to keep profits high. 
**NOTE:** Before you label me a commie (as many of you probably are), I believe in the free market, but there are some things that companies shouldn't be in charge of running. Companies working for profit will seek ways to maximize profits, including unfair and disadvantageous practices like speculating and monopolizing. However, all the Libertarian party would like to see is the revitalization of the Barons of old and the monopolies that ensured people stayed poor. Walmart is bringing back the company store with food stamps instead of fair wages and so on. We could sit here all day, but my views are unpopular.

The current symbol is most recognized one, plus the other one is the Thai baht. It's OK... However, it just doesn't have the same recognition as the original version and the only benefit that the Thai baht has is that it's in the unicode database. Instead of trying to force the millions (maybe hundreds of thousands) of people familiar with bitcoin, organize to have the bitcoin symbol added to unicode

Man in the middle is a form of rerouting traffic between you and your intended receiver. the attacker gets in the middle of you and the server you are trying to reach. Yes, I think I understand.
Do you understand what a repository is?
Edit: it's a bit more complicated than what I wrote, but basically a rogue server or computer (or network of computers) replicate the routing information of your intended destination making you believe you have a direct connection to the website.
You can use wireshark to check and verify all connections, always verify your software's digital signature or use trusted and verified repositories. If you would like to doubly sure, download the source code and compile bthe software yourself.
ALSO, stop using windows.

Ever heard of moderation and regulation on both MNC and government. I'm not against free markets but I'm for regulations and transparency of government. WE the people have the right to have a say in our governments and see what's going on. We need public news outlets that aren't owned by companies wanting to influence your views. We need a government that is a accountable for their actions just as much as corporations! corporations aren't people and governments shouldn't be dictaors but we can't have one extreme or the other. That's whats wrong with the libertarian view. You assume companies are all good but when we have Koch industries influence our government (AND founding the Libertarian Party and Tea Party) then we have some issues man. We let governments AND business to grow too large. We have let corporations take away the voice of the people and all of the militarist industrialist will give the "evil" governments all weapons they need as long as they keep lobbying for the use of more and more force. We have the prison industrial complex that promotes increase incarceration rates when we should have public education campaigns to improve society. 
Honestly, I get where you're coming and I think it goes from one extreme to another. It's not a solution, it's just another problem. There needs to be a middle ground and the libertarian movement is not the right one. I'm in academics and all I do is trudge through comparative political theses and comprehensive reviews of the structures of government. It's boring, tedious and heavy research. One of my current research topics is Chinese cyber military warfare, and 5 hours a day going through documents, military reviews and so and so forth. 
**ANYWAYS**, What you're advocating is giving the keys from one drunk driver to another. We should have freer fairer elections, zero private founding of campaigns, the removal of the electoral college and have direct democracy. There are plenty of things we can do, but giving corporations absolute power isn't a good idea either... The real issue with the Libertarian party is not the idea, it's the people who are behind. This party is backed as fronted by trillion dollar corporations that stand to gain a lot more money and power with the eliminations of regulations that are in place from companies also becoming tyrannical. I know you think corporations have good intentions, but just like governments, some companies can be pure evil. Some governments are good, some are bad. There are good and bad cases all over the world. Same goes with corporations. What we need to do is get the money out of politics and keep the decision making to people who are actually experts in the fields environment and public policy. If we remove money from the politics, we can remove some of our problems. Not all... but I sure don't greedy, money driven MNCs can't always be right either, especially if their accounts stand to lose.

**Edit 2/TDLR: To put things in simpler terms, the Libertarian philosophy is the exact opposite of Communism. Both sound great on paper, both have sound theories... BOTH are terrible when executed.**

How? I have [trigeminal neuralgia]( and in the America WITH health insurance, an ambulance cost me $5,000. 
When I was first admitted for TN, I wasn't told where I was going, how much it would cost and the fact that they did a number of procedures without my consent that was ended up costing THOUSANDS of dollars that the insurance company never covered and I was stuck with a bill of $11,756. 
I had a similar issue in Canada with my TN. The total cost was $250. Universal Healthcare.

We need smarter planning and good conservation efforts. Not these giant suburban areas that stretch out for hundreds of miles destroying large swaths of land. The research is there, we are now responsible for the extintion of a significant number of species and we're making things worse. A third of amphibians, a quarter of mammals, depleting as much as half of our fish stocks. We need larger, more efficient living spaces with clear drawn out areas for conservation and we also need to begin taking back sparsely populated areas for reforestation and a plan to turn suburban areas into farms or conservation areas. Global warming is real and we are wrecking the environment at an alarming rate. I know it hurts to hear it, but something must be done and no one is going to be happy about it. Unfortunately if we don't change as a society to consume less, populate less and begin conserving the environment or we'll be responsible for the next mass extinction and the possible destruction of our own species.

Communism = bad,  but thanks for misunderstanding my point. It's not so black and white as you think it is. Governments can be bad just as much as corporations can be bad as well. Neither are inherently I evil or good. By regulating both and seeking the middle ground, we can then seek to harmonize both sectors because both of them have many benefits and many drawbacks. 
The benefits of the private sector is efficiency, the drawback is the profits over people approach. 
The benefits of the public sector is of course public services and goods rendered without the need for profit. The drawback is that government must be closely monitored and politicians the held accountable. 
Some things shouldn't be in the hand of government just as must as we shouldn't trust the private sector to handle certain industries.

Stand your ground is my right as a citizen to be a gun wielding racist that has an innate fear of minorities and brown people, it's my second and first amendment right.  
Let's face it, we don't have a government problem, we have a cultural and politic problem. We allowed government to give too much freedom to billionaires and the class elites who have turned around and used that money to influence politics. The libertarian party is just a front for Koch Industries and the like. We need less money in politics

I already had a very extensive debate here on I don't see the need to have another debate with libertarians. The problem is not governments, but people. Giving power from governments to the private sector won't solve anything. We need better participatory and regulatory measures in place to regulate both government and private sector. 
By finding the middle ground, it's easier to seek progress. Going from one extreme (communism) to another (libertarianism) will meet with the same results. I'm an interventionalist liberal and a Buddhist, so my views are not as extreme as these people I would end up arguing with. I see no point in it, it'll be an effort of frustration.

I am a minority. I'm Colombian-American and know exactly what it means to use force to gain control. My family gained asylum because of La Era de Violencia and while you'll hate to hear this, the American system is beautiful but we've given too much power corporations in the form of the Military Industrial Complex. Military COMPANIES are lobbying government big, small, local and federal to buy military equipment. My local government just bought tactical swat armored vehicles, I don't blame the government. Businesses know it's good for their profit margins if they can sell APCs but the government doesn't want them then who? Anyone who will buy them. Both sides have many issues but until you're willing to accept that their is too much corporate power and influence in government, nothing will change. 
If you could look up the Wolf PAC, you'll understand what I mean. They're working to end Citizens United and keep corporate dollars from buying our government. Unless you have a billion dollars to buy a senator, I don't see anything changing any time soon.
