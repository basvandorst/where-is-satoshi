The more data we can get - the more mainstrem BTC will be
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:25:04

Will we see epic bitcoin painting soon or epic bitcoin movie? 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:39:09
It can be true but i'm not sure about it. Of course tech giants have a hardware for BTC testing but i'm not sure that bitcoins are their target
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:31:14
Yeah and it will make us free from pools. Amazing, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:48:10
Why did you believe him? 
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:49:21
He is kinda Bitcoin God or King of all bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:40:02
Wish you will have a lot of views.
Btw, you should change name of your channel.

What do you mean "doesn't exist". Preventing reaction to the problem means that we a realize that problem will happen, but we will deal with it without taking damage.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:30:08
Yeah, you are right, bro. Everyone can taste this advantage
@_date: 2014-06-06 07:51:53
Sharing is caring.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:41:02
I got your position. You seem to be right. I need to take a thought about it.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:50:08
Or John Lennon. But who cares?
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:38:53
Ha! Now i can new watches for my self and for my friend for his birthday! 
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:51:28
With a shit load of errors. BTC community won't support him i'm pretty sure.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:55:21
So, that's why we have a reason to think that he probably could be that special Satoshi. =D
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:50:41
Yeah! I want to buy all my favourite games on Steam by using bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:36:26
NYC seems to be BTC-friendly city.
@_date: 2014-06-06 07:56:22
Mistery man. Unknown exotic forecaster. Let's call him Croup Nostradamus!
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:08:02

@_date: 2014-06-22 16:00:55
Haha, i knew that somebody will tell a joke about this amazing shit. 
But be sure dude, nobody will hear you because of sound of your awesomeness.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:31:30
Maybe he is Satoshi? Lol
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:22:25
Forget about people at your work. The success will come only after some golddiggers will eat your dick because of Bitcoin!

Paypal largest risk is chargebacks on credit card funding against PayPal as the merchant. Then on top of this they have to pay the credit card companies fees which could easily approach over 50% what they collect in fees from the merchants. Ever wonder why PayPal deliberately makes it as awkward as possible to fund your account when making a payment using a credit card rather than using a bank account? Bitcoin eliminates both of the above risks and can actually allow PayPal to position itself as a consumer friendly add on to Bitcoin that protects against fraudulent merchants.

There is difference among price inflation or issue inflation. What you talk about is issue inflation and i dont think is high right now at all.
What OP says is price inflation, that right now when price is not stable is quite hard to measure. But eventually there wil be deflation.
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:43:15
I'm voting for the third option
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:20:07
Brothels have a tend to advertise Bitcon. =D
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:20:27
Thx you for that alert dude
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:33:04
Imo you will wait for an explanation for ages! 
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:58:42
I thought that ISIS is kinda International Secret Intelligence Service.

@_date: 2014-06-28 16:23:10
Wow. Such bundocks. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:01:27
It's never to late for BTC farming
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:59:25
And another 11th September memorial day
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:48:52
God won't help us because bitcoin is a diablo's creation.
