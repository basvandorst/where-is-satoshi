You don't need that with Trezor. It's immune since you verify destination and amount on the Trezor screen and the signing is done within the secure element.

So you're talking about dollars then.
You said:

They have some issues with trading lags that probably are more important at the moment.
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:41:38
For dollar maybe, but for Euro is terrible, trying bitwala although it's coverted to Euro on deposit, so not really a "proper bitcoin debit card" but you only get 0.5% fee in the end.

Have you done a planned test? Personally I noted all the rates (Kraken, BitPay, BitstampUSD) even xe.com and spot rates for USD/EUR and their Euro rate from the app. They clearly had hidden rates well above 2%.
@_date: 2016-04-21 08:04:05
They probably got shutdown by SEC because they didn't do a plain check of the law, so stupid, can't believe Coindesk had the on the "best startup/product" award choice.

 there is no such entry at that time.

LN uses an onion-like *payment* routing but not Tor itself, although it could run through Tor with some work.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:11:56
I doubt any of the LN devs will agree with the "slow" part.

Here's a donut (thanks to werwiewas) :D
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:52:27
Good idea. Although variable trading fees and no transactions while the issues occurred, but I'll check what I can get.
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:29:20
Glad to see we'll be getting some heavy promotion, but they really could do better job, I hope they change their direction.

The font looks a bit old, sans-serif is the only way I think.
Also the alignment of the up/down arrow needs to be vertically aligned.
Lastly, the icons are a bit distracting, you may want to try monochromed versions.

Client is far away and payment was out of schedule.

Not in my experience. They kept asking for different certs.

Exactly, there is no payment method (RL or not) that the payee doesn't see the amount to be paid just before paying and confirming it, unless you have established a long-years pattern of trust.
Cute demo, but in the end we have to be pragmatic on how to evolve the payment UX.
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:35:47
Awesome! Really weird that they haven't thought about it till you requested it. Good job
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:45:01
Way too many verification steps. They should streamline it a bit.

Just the other day I had to pay another business via a bank I don't normally use (but it's the recipient's bank) and I had to pay $1 transaction fee, fuck that.

It's about time we get real with DAOs. DAOs are not a holy grail.
Instead of saying buzzwords we should start either proposing how an implementation would help a problem or focus on solving the problem itself.

Haha :P I use Kraken as well, but I've been inactive for a long time.
However I could say some things I don't like about Kraken but it's not the time.

Also, having lower no deposit minimum than the withdrawal minimum.
Happened to me on a Chinese stocks site that had a 3-number domain that can't remember right now.

The IRS guidance might prove more hurtful than China. Still holding though.

Thanks werwiewas but if it keeps happening, I'd rather not have to post again and again.

You completely missed the point. It's not about being "respectful" to Karpeles...
EDIT: ... fuck that guy. (happy troll?)
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:43:12
And they retroactively charge extra fees for past transactions?
@_date: 2014-11-19 13:01:06
Actually, this could work although I doubt it's intentional by the designer.
Selfish mining.
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:21:04
No idea why the downvote, this is most probably the case, since they already stated:
"We are working to transfer a secure backup of the Bitstamp site onto a new safe environment and will be bringing this online in the coming days" - 
@_date: 2019-03-25 02:26:23
Btw, even in the non-custodial mode of LndHub you can be affected by their lack of use of a proper database with transactions and a proper implementation that uses DB transactions to properly account funds.
This is rather a warning so people don't put too many eggs in one basket and be aware. Sure go ahead and tinker but know where you are getting yourself into.
@_date: 2019-03-14 17:27:50
No need to trust any single individual, just don't have just a single channel but have many with multiple different node operators (LNBIG is a single node operator).
I know people don't do that, so I hope wallets will do better on educating users.
@_date: 2018-10-21 19:04:48
Small correction. He along with other investors, invested on Lightning Labs - not a donation.
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:33:15
Now make another text post apologizing or I hope Kraken will sue you for defamation.
@_date: 2019-03-14 12:58:59
Step 3. Raise fees to crazy levels
and just milk those that have channels with LNBIG. I hope people diversify and don't connect with just LNBIG or any single hub. In reality all those LNBIG nodes are a worse version of a single big node, if one of them is gone, probably all of them will be, people will force-close down the channels and cause probably temporarily mempool congestion. I hope he isn't some "imposter" with a greater plan for LN FUD.

Any commentary from Core devs on Flex Transactions?
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:56:10
Ah thx, my bad, I was misdirected by GH's last commit date shown as `May 3, 2018`.


Indeed, that would help "decouple" Bitcoin from the internet and allow easier integration with mesh-nets or similar. Probably a faux-client/proxy as a glue in-between would be faster until Bitcoin Core gets there.
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:25:15
The suggested Bitcoin Fibre client software version is somewhat outdated (e.x: it doesn't contain the latest CVE fix). Are there any plans for constructing a more flexible system that allows the use of Bitcoin Core instead?
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:22:42
I've tried some services trying to organize the lending marketplace, and they are pretty useless. Offer pretty much nothing for their fees.
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:33:18
That's impossible, the TXs are done in direct communication between nodes in pair (see channels). There are no public data.

It could be for both and so the extra satoshi could go as a miner fee, but not sure.
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:40:34
Hi Fernando,
Thanks for the reply. However, that's quite hidden, I didn't notice it existed, plus it's not present on the mobile app. Secondly, there is a bit gap.
For example:
Now 00:35 UTC, we have 399.7 USD Xapo BTC rate and 358.77 EUR on the link you gave me.
But 399.7 USD is 367.88 EUR (using xe.com).
2.5% difference.
If there is such gap on the exchanges then that's an opportunity for  arbitrage, so let me know what exchanges you use, so I can profit as well :P
So with that gap in mind, it's pretty obvious there are some hidden fees. 
I presume you will say that for each pair(BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) has it's own exchange, but data from exchanges that offer BTC/EUR like Kraken, don't show such gap on the prices.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:52:01
