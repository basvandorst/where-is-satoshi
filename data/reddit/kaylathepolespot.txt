I’m going to open an exchange in Monaco and trade back and forth with myself until we’re number 1!

It’s usually traders.  
Trader Mike thinks the price of bitcoin will go down. He sells all of his BTC for $1000. Mike withdraws $200 for cold hard USD cash and buys his mom dinner. Mike wants to use the other $800 to rebuy bitcoin later. Since this is still on the exchange, it’s still USDT. It isn’t USD until he actually withdraws it. So, mike now holds $800 usdt.
Bitfinex uses usdt like this.
Even if the exchange said they sold you USD. They might not have the USD reserves to account for it. So, holding USD in an exchange is just as good as holding USDT. What’s risky is that the exchange doesn’t have the funds to payout Real USD if people demand the cash.
Why would Mike do this? Well there is a cost and time to withdrawing money from an exchange. For example MIke would need to send the BTC to his own wallet, and use something like local bitcoins to sell it for cash. When he is ready to rebuy, do the reverse of this. Keeping your usd in the exchange is a risk many traders take to avoid this.

Connivence... I don’t eat much McDonald’s because I need to walk 20mins to the closest one. If one opens up next to me, I’ll probably impulse buy it.

I don't understand  how more people have cars than electricity (or light?).

It's probably because  you check the price on bitfinex.
