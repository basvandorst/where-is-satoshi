Could you give an update on the status if there is any? Would like to know if BFX will come back online to support any type of withdrawals and to see exactly who is affected.

They should have had their ducks in a row from the beginning to prevent this from happening. This reason and all the other problems with exchanges is why we need regulation in this area of Crypto. I realize that decentralization is the goal but without any form of regulation and consequences on the exchange or insurance for their customers this will just keep happening.

What's the point of the bit license in NY if there is no added security for users? Just a cash grab?

The answer is not the bitcoin blockchain or the block size that is a different thing altogether and is specific to bitcoin. To solve the inter bank issues with asset transfer a permissioned blockchain that is scalable with layered instruction technology is what will solve this and get the banks on the blockchain and eventually get bitcoin universally  accepted.

Support and resistance levels are created at levels where there is enough involvement that when the price gets in those areas that involvement creates a barrier as such. When that is created the price will usually reverse or move sideways as it has a difficult time breaking through. As we are talking about Bitcoin and there are not that many world factors that effect it, these levels are created by the marketplace. When traders feel that the price has hit a place that is low enough they want to buy and when traders feel that the price is high enough they want to sell and you see more of this over time at certain levels with increased participation.

He makes some valid remarks but I think this may just be to serve his own purposes and ego as XT failed on its first attempt and the bitcoin community didn't want to play on his team. His comment about how "This gives them (China) a perverse financial incentive to actually try and stop Bitcoin becoming popular, is completely out of wack. If they made bitcoin unpopular it would decrease in value and decrease their incentive, making it more expensive to mine and eventually just stop mining altogether. As soon as I read that I realized that this was just a rant to cause disruption. As he didn't leave bitcoin completely signing with R3 he must still believe in bitcoin as it relates to the blockchain.

Thank you for your comment but you obviously did not understand the article. If you had you would realize that I am saying that the people in charge of the future of Bitcoin ie: core developers, miners- need to make a decision about its future before a government comes in and creates their own digital currency that will have the same characteristics as Bitcoin but accepted by governments worldwide. Mass adoption only happens when the majority accepts. If the social majority lose faith in Bitcoin before mass adoption then Bitcoin dies and some other most likely government backed digital currency will survive. Just loving decentralization and not understanding how our world and society works makes you ignorant to what has to really happen in order for great creations like Bitcoin to survive. I don't think FIAT currencies will survive but what replaces it must be more stable than Bitcoin is right now.

As I appreciate your reply and enthusiasm about bitcoin as I do believe that digital currency is the future but you are mistaken about a lot of this. 1 Western Union uses the SWIFT union and internal transfer methods it's only expensive because they have been ripping people off since their creation. The SWIFT network is a messaging system that can if used properly be free and instant. 
Fee's on BTC will indeed go up with the price of bitcoin as the fees are usually set by the wallet in most cases. If BTC does not scale than people will do what they always have done and offered to pay more for better service ie: pay more fees to get their transactions done faster. Also if BTC does not scale properly and more people do adopt it the network will be overwhelmed and even slower. It's not only the people not holding BTC that will be negatively impacted it's everyone as it will effect everyone and if people are turned away then it wont be mass adopted and it will die. 
Rewarding the early adopters is not a feature it's a result as is any stock that rises if the company does well. If BTC does well than yes but if it fails than all the early adopters are the biggest losers. 
No the more people who are invested in it's success the faster the ecosystem and technology will improve. Have you heard of Mike Hearn??? The people who are in control ie: the core developers and the miners need to agree and move forward to achieve common goals. 
It's great you are a bitcoin maximalist but you need to get some education on the world works.

LOL.

This was sent to me. I am not sure what wallet but I will find out. That is really interesting that nodes may not relay a transaction and time them out in 72 hours. This is a definite issue, a major roadblock for mass adoption I think. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 02:50:24
It's not about it being free or affording it. It is said to be free to use it's misleading and these types of issues will hinder it's adoption. Also it may be $.02 now but if there is no scaling and if the price of BTC sky rockets than the costs go up, people will just use their bank or other Fiat gateways that are cheaper, faster and more dependable.

Actually I can send international wires for free there are many retail FX houses that do this. I don't know what bank you are dealing with. As I don't agree with the Banks or how they do business I do not have those issues, I can transfer between all my accounts domestic and international instantly for no fee and if those accounts provide interest than I still receive it. Bitcoin does not pay interest and the price can drastically change in the time it takes to receive it before you can spend it.
