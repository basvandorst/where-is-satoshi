I used to like your articles, but after this comment, I think I'll find other bitcoin writers to follow.

what it's your blog you should know why you wrote debtor and not creditor. it makes no sense to pay a debtor.

just because there is a public ledger doesn't mean there is an identity tied to it. most people fail by giving out real identity information to third party services.

Sorry my original post didn't mean to imply to ONLY use web wallets that require emails, I may have worded it incorrectly. Wallets that don't require anything obviously are preferred.

who will be subpoenaed?
The wallet service I gave no info to which I anonymized using Tor and Tails? I forgot to mention mixing services, which provides plausible deniability. 
LocalBitcoins where I did the same, where some person maybe knows my general idea of my face, but I paid with cash. I don't even buy in areas close to my residence for greater questionability. 
I would really like to see some authority try to tie my bitcoin transactions to my real identity. It won't be possible.

Did you read the post? This had nothing to do with blockchain.info. OP clearly was hacked.

So why is BTCC perpetuating the lie then?? They are tweeting out the cointelegraph article like crazy from all their social media channels and have their own URL too

If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry. Maybe there are other people in this forum who can explain it to you.

* one of the first bitcoin exchanges
* saw lots of volume, had a lot of early bitcoin users on it
* was hacked a couple times if i'm not mistaken which may have led to them running on a fractional reserve and then running the willy bot
* by running the willy bot they created fake volume and a fake bubble running up the bitcoin price to above $1k
* then everything unraveled when it was discovered they were faking trades and that they lost $650k in customer funds, went bankrupt, and now the ceo Karpeles was indicted for embezzlement.

i don't but if you have bitcoins to spend, sure you can make money on the markup, but it would have to be a lot of work because there is only so much spread you can markup.
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:45:19
I'm picturing this 
Making this happen with Bitcoin could be fairly trivial. A simple QR code could display for a micro-tx and when paid access is granted. By paying over time it would help cover cost of water and cleaning supplies, etc. I'm sure the govt could subsidize programs like this too. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 22:41:20
*Alternatives* to what? OP didn't even say. Stop spamming this junk unless expressly asked for it.

~~it helps fund the government, what else do you think would happen to it? just how they use the money, well they wont tell you that exactly... but it probably varies depending on needs from staffing to equipment to funding wars.~~

It's a marketing technique. They rope in new customers with zero fees. Get you locked in on their platform. Then introduce fees later. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:20:11
yeah, i think it's a poor choice of wording.... nonetheless, it's still a bit strange about what happened, because it's still unclear how some users had their coins stolen??
@_date: 2015-10-24 13:12:45
Clearly they didn't do their homework and they don't like feedback (see negative downvotes)  
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:42:42
interesting stats, certainly bring up some good points and i'm sure wallet devs know this already. i wonder how big the entire wallet network really is, maybe 50 million wallet users? there is probably some overlap though to account for...

You don't have to, some wallets ask for an email. I've used many and it was just something that is easily diverted by using a fake email. The preferred method would be to not give out any email at all.

**Guns Inquiry Urges Action Against 14 in Justice Dept.**
[The Inspector General's investigation] faulted several Justice Department officials for related failures, including not recognizing what should have been red flags about the way Operation Fast and Furious was unfolding and failing to follow up on information about both it and a similar 2006 case called Operation Wide Receiver. In the earlier case, Arizona-based A.T.F. agents also used “the tactic of failing to seize firearms despite having a sufficient legal basis to do so” in the hope of identifying more dangerous criminals.
Among other things, the report faulted several higher-level Justice Department officials for not asking more questions, focusing in particular on **Jason Weinstein**, an assistant deputy attorney general who had learned about the Operation Wide Receiver case in the spring of 2010 and who signed off on several wiretap applications for Operation Fast and Furious that, the report said, should have alerted him to ask more questions and raise alarms.
**Mr. Weinstein** resigned on Wednesday. He portrayed himself in his letter of resignation as a scapegoat.

No, only if you buy. It's easy to sign up and register and not buy. How many do that is another question. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:45:57
not really unless you do a localbitcoins trade or mycelium trade. both are safe by the way, but you do need to be aware and careful since they are inperson trades (sometimes). some people offer direct cash deposits to bank accounts. you just gotta look into it.
