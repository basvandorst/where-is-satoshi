Isn't GHASH ultimately incentivized to stay below 50%? It's pretty clear that once they hit it, BTC value plummets, as it should. 
Ironically, I think that what has occured is the system WORKING, not breaking down. As GHASH gets to 50%, people get nervous, start to sell, GHASH realizes they're better off financially capping themselves at 45%.
It's certainly a big scare to see it happen but ultimately, the situation resolved itself. They stuck their finger closer and closer to the fire... got burned... presumably they and everyone else will ultimately get the message, even if it takes broaching 50% (and seeing btc crash) 5 times.

I dunno, that's not really true. TA has a lot to do with mass psychology. If there's a herd of sheep, and you are the shepherd, you'll have a better idea of where the herd is going than any single member of the herd.
If *everyone* is a shepherd, then you're right, technical analysis does indeed break down. 
But that's really the only situation where technical analysis completely breaks down - too many frontrunners. The same is not true of too few (i.e our one shepherd would make out pretty well with a good head on his shoulders).
It's not about how many people "think it works," it's about how many people are actively trying to separate themselves from a group mentality, which is something innate in our nature. Nobody wants to be the guy betting on the "no pass" line. 
Though granted it's easier from behind a computer screen.

What if you are using blockchain.info without downloading the actual blockchain (and bitcoin software)? In this case is your private key stored on their server in encrypted form?

"A person uses bitcoins to order pizza three months after a marketplace was established for the currency. The pizza cost the person 10,000 bitcoins."
10,000 BTC pizza should look better than that, lol

Create your bitcoin addresses offline, never let your private keys see an internet connection, store them either on paper or encrypted in a truecrypt container. That'll do the trick.

No, there's no way, because they very well may be right and bitcoin will fall to pieces.
However, it might be worth letting them know that Apple stock was once worth $10 a share. And plenty of smart people recognized that if the company DIDN'T flop, it was going to succeed wildly. Bitcoin may very well be worth nothing, but I feel quite confident saying that IF it succeeds, it will reward those who bought in, before success was a foregone conclusion.

You made a really bad bet. 
You should've been getting some pretty substantial odds there.
