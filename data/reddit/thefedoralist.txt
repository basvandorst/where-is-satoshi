Can you do a log-log scatter plot, market cap vs. Tx/day? A power law should give you a fairly linear set of points.

By sending them bitcoin you become an accessory to crime. To avoid extradition you should change your name, move to Panama and/or St. Kitts, and wear a fake beard.

**There aren't any savings for the merchant.** Even if you use a middleman like Bitpay that (for now) eats up the direct fees and costs of accepting bitcoin, you still need to train your staff, do extra accounting work, handle extra user complaints etc. which also cost money.

Out of the things I mentioned only the staff training is a capital cost. Accepting another payment system, especially one as complicated as bitcoin, carries an extra marginal cost for every transaction.
*And then* there's the matter of the middleman eventually raising its fees to a sustainable level.
Merchants aren't stupid. If bitcoin brought them any real advantages, they'd be using it.

Until it's a working part of the mainnet it's vapourware.

Where did you get those numbers? Have you never used a bank?
