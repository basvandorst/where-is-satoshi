You do know that you don't actually store bitcoins in a wallet, right?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:22:47
No, it did not.  Someone in Europe could demand gold as a regular person.  in 1933 it was made illegal for a normal us citizen to own gold without a special license.  That is entirely different from the currency being backed by said gold.
The point of a currency being backed by gold, is that other countries can exchange that currency for gold.  By the way, the restriction on owning gold was lifted in 1974.  
Do NOT confuse these two things.

No, sell walls are a deceitful statement of intent to sell or buy, but the real intent is to cancel before the price gets to it.  No sell or buy actually occurs (or very little if the price changes too rapidly for them to get out of the position before it reaches their price).
Some people seem to claim that sell or buy walls cause the price to change.  They do not.  Only people actually buying and selling (not pretending to) can make the price change.

Almost every exchange that was operating in 2010 (there were not many, the first opened in mid-2010) are now defunct.  In those days, it was not easy to purchase bitcoin, you typically had to go get a money order or cashiers check and send it to someone via obscure methods.  It was a lot of work, and not something that someone would easily do off the cuff with no computer knowledge.
In other words, you would remember it.. unless you have brain injury or something.
It is just highly unlikely.  Either it wasn't 2010, and a few years later.. or he's likely not being honest.

Do not confuse "cryptography" with "encryption".  They are two different things.
The blockchain uses cryptographical hashing to sigh transactions.  They are not "encrypted".  "encrypting" hides the content through 2-way reversible encryption, cryptographical hashing is 1-way data mangling.  
Hashes can be used to hide information as well, but they are not reversible and thus are not "encryption".

Banks are required to report any suspicious banking activity.  What is considered "suspicious" varies by bank, but i can see some banks considering wire transfers from overseas, from known crypto accounts to be suspicious.
KYC means more than just getting your identification.  It also means tracking your banking habits and identifying when you deviate from them.
Oh, and if you don't think the IRS monitors all offshore wire transfers, no matter how small, you're crazy.

BTC sees BCH as a hostile takeover attempt.  Complete with massive amounts of FUD, character assassinations, outright lies, as well as more mundane misinformation.  Bad blood was created in a vain attempt to convince everyone to switch to BCH.
BCH sees BTC as spoiling their parade.  How dare BTC continue on like nothing happened?  They're basically the failed coup attempt and now they're bitter that it only marginally succeeded and is still limping along.  Another branch sees BTC as somehow having been "invaded" by corporate interests and is leading BTC down a path to failure.
This is made even worse by the popular belief that if they just keep buying more BCH, it will turn around and make them rich.  And when it doesn't... depression.
So there's a lot of anger, hostility, fear, anxiety, and pretty much every other human emotion tied up in this.

2) You are only using paypal, who will probably shut you down within days.
3) You aren't following "Know your customer" laws.. if you're in the US the government will come knocking and probably force you to shut down.
4) Your 10% fee isn't nearly enough to cover the chargebacks you're going to get. 
5) You seem to have no clue about what financial risks you're taking on.  
Good Luck with that.

A lot of people do it in the beginning, until they realize the fees are as much as they're making, and then they stop.  It's not about "not making a lot of money", it's about "not making ANY money", in many cases.

Coinbase has no real customer service at this time to speak of.  Most other exchanges are similar, although some report Kraken has pretty good customer service (others have said the opposite... so.. you know.. reasons), and I believe they're located in California.. 
Coinbase has a standard 4% credit card transaction fee, however they offer discounts for US customers that bring it down to a much smaller amount.  It could be that Coinbase thinks your IP address is located in another country.

If you're not a degenerate, and have a banking history, that should be no problem.  I've withdrawn 10's of thousands in cash many times and never had an issue.  If all transactions have cleared, and your account is in good standing, they have no reason to perform any kind of inquiry.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:20:48
I don't know where you live, but my bank allows me to just transfer money electronically through my portal with all accounts I own.  I can even move money from credit cards (though I have limits and pay more interest).  
Worst case scenario, you should have been able to just withdraw the money (no check, just a withdrawal slip) as cash, the deposit as cash in your other account.

@_date: 2017-08-09 18:15:29
Yes, this is all very true.  You essentially get an IOU from the exchange or bank.  And they can do whatever they want with those funds.
You should all count yourself lucky that many exchanges are giving you BCH, because they really don't have to.  I think they are mostly doing it because they don't want to deal with shitstorm of abuse they'll get otherwise.

Your coins are not in your wallet.  so there is nothing to "remove".  The only thing in your wallet is your private key.  All your coins are on the blockchain.  
What you want to do is cold storage.  There are many ways to do this, but you can simply create a private wallet, transfer your balance that wallet address, and then backup your wallet (keys) to a usb stick or print it out, and then delete your data from your computer.

Yes, they do.








That isn't what she seemed to be saying.  If it is, it was poorly worded.  She specifically said "Bitcoin fees".  
If it was her bank charging the fees, she would contact the bank, not Coinbase.  CB doesn't control what a bank charges.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:01:16
Ridiculous.  They won't win anything, and CB is unlikely to settle because it would create a bad precedent.
There are no coins that "rightfully" belong to them.  When you send your coins to CB (or any other exchange or online wallet), you are giving them the coins to do with as they please, they just promise to give them back to you upon request.  
This is no different from a bank that will lend out the money you deposit with them.  Sure, they might pay a minimal amount of interest, but they are not required to do so.  They do it as an incentive to get you to invest with them.
If you do not control the keys, you are not due any fork coin.  Be thankful that some exchanges are willingly offering their fork coins to users, but don't confuse that with being "owed" them.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:28:27
You would probably need some kind of trading bot.  Most of the built-in tools in the exchanges are pretty limited.  You can set a limit order, which will buy or sell when conditions occur, but not multiple sequences.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:35:19
The fees are not the same.  US customers pay 1.49%, non-US customers pay 4%.  The base fee is the same, but Coinbase gives a discount to US customers of 2.5%.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:21:54
I really doubt PayPal will support this.  They have VERY strict rules about merchants and what not.  Most exchanges will only deposit to PayPal because of this.  
Switzerland also has some pretty draconian banking laws as well, so i'd be very careful and hire a lawyer first.

I'm not justifying that.. but most of us.. this just doesn't happen.  You show them the bank receipt that you just withdrew it, and they know the money has a paper trail.  It's proof that the money has come from a lawful source.

That's 2.4%, which is not particularly high, but is probably higher than it should be.  Chances are, your transaction had multiple inputs because it had arrived in your wallet in multiple transactions.

You will essentially get black listed if you stop payment.  You'll have all kinds of problems going forward if you actually want to continue in crypto.
Here's a suggestion for the future though.  Don't buy when the price has been going up for a long time.  buy during dips, when the price goes down.  Finding the actual bottom can be difficult, but in general, if you expect the price to start going back up then buying after a downturn is the best choice.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:01:36
I think the main resistance is to the idea of a hard fork.  It's a lot of hassle, and possibly all for naught.  What happens if a significant portion of the base sticks to the original chain.. Which one is called Bitcoin?  Which has to come up with its own justification for existence?  
None of these things are unsolveable, but they just create more headaches for everyone, rather than working together to improve Bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:59:04
Most exchanges will transfer your coins to an internal wallet they use for various purposes (cold storage, liquidity, etc..).  They keep your account balance on their own accounting system, and when you request it back they send it from their central storage.
it's like a bank.  When you deposit a $100 bill, and you later withdraw that $100, they don't typically give you the same $100 bill back.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:59:45

All economies have bubbles.  The question is, will they rebound.  Real-estate, for instance, has had many bubbles, but it keeps rebounding.

@_date: 2017-08-05 08:07:46
Such paperwork is routine, and takes no time out of your transaction.  It's just something that gets done during nightly processing.  I've withdrawn &gt; 10k many times.  If you have your withdrawal receipt, that proves the source of the funds, then there's nothing the police can do.  It's only if you have no paperwork for it that they can seize it.  You see all these videos an 99.9% of the time, it's money hidden in a secret compartment of a car or wrapped up in cash with drug residue.. lol

He's not wrong actually.  But, and this is the key point here, he's more risk averse than you are.  You still have 50 or 60 years left to earn a retirement if everything goes sideways.  He doesn't.
Crypto is either a long term play, or a short term one.  It's seldom a medium term one, and people with &lt; 10-20 years until retirement are not going to want to risk their savings on something that is risky.
Crypto is in fact risky, very risky.  The fact that it can swing in price $1000+ in a week is crazy risky.  And lots of us are fine with that risk.  I know I am.  But, lots of people aren't.

Unless you're going to try a 0 fee transfer, having a lot of tiny transactions (from faucets) will basically eat up all your actual profit when you go to cash it out.  And frankly, at todays mempool situaiton, a 0 fee transaction with lots of inputs just won't get confirmed.

The reason was that it was possible for anyone to spend coins from a segwit wallet before segwit activated.  Wallets deliberately did not include segwit support until after activation to prevent clueless users from accidentally creating wallets that could then allow anyone to spend their bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:55:52
Bitcoin Cash is not consensus because the vast majority of the nodes stayed with Bitcoin.

You cannot apply stock market logic to currency markets, and especially not cryptocurrency markets.
You see, unlike stocks, you can buy portions of a unit of cryptocurrency.  If a stock is worth $700, you HAVE to pay at least $700. You can't buy, say.. half a share (outside of funds, that is) Not so with cryptos.  You can buy as little or as much as you want, thus the notion that it takes "big money" because the price is so high is in fact misguided.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:13:18
That certain did not happen during the Bitcoin Cash fork.  In fact, BCH was priced at about $1000 initiall, and the BTC price didn't budge.  It did drop shortly after, but that was due to other external factors. (China, Russia, etc.. i forget what the actual news was that caused the slight drop).
BCH however, started to tank quickly as people sold off as soon as they could.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:17:15
What do you mean by "just got around to depositing it"?  When bitcoin is sent, it's "deposited" as soon as it's on the blockchain.

Yes, it's possible that the value of BTC will drop after the fork, because people will not be trying to hoarde it for the fork.  But that doesn't mean it will drop by exactly the value of b2x.  
Lots of people try to compare a coin fork to a stock split.  In a stock split, the original stock is reduced in value by the amount of the additional stock (2x, 3x, etc..).  That's not the case with a coin fork, since you're not issuing more of the original coin.  You're creating a totally new coin with its own valuation.  Nothing is lost of the original coin (though it can cause price changes do to network and side-effects, such as selling one coin to buy the other).

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:11:56
Empty blocks are nothing new.  Some miners mine empty blocks during the period it takes the network to assemble a new block (a few seconds).  However, occasionally they get lucky and find a valid hash on an empty block in that small time frame.
It's just a small quirk in the way the bitcoin network operates, and like all quirks, there are those that exploit it.  It's not like they could be mining valid transactions during that time.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:12:58
Each server has it's own copy of the mempool.  If the server is restarted, then it clears the mempool on that server, and it's quickly re-created.  In this case, the stats server either had a failure, or it read a server with an empty mempool, net read it had a full mempool.

Two problems.  1) mempool is high, leading to higher fees.  2) Price of bitcoin is much higher, so the fees are therefore much worse.. because fees are based on BTC, not USD.

Hodlers != Miners.  and they both do not = nodes.  
The community can change whatever it wants if there is enough incentive to do so.  For instance, huge fees created an incentive to fork an 8MB block.
If enough bitcoin is lost or burned, there will be a huge incentive to create smaller units, since 1 satoshi could become too expensive for ordinary people to purchase.

Yes, of course that's a correct statement.  The more people that want to sell than buy, the lower the price goes.

You really have not seen some of the tools available to track transactions lately.  I saw one report, where they were tracking the wannacry proceeds and it was a nice graph showing multiple hops through each exchange.  It was quite impressive.

Bitcoin is only limited because the community has agreed to limit it.  They can also agree to increase the supply... some argue that a fork essentially does that (though I don't buy into that argument).  Although, thinks like lightning network and side-chains could easily increase the supply.

Energy cost in the US varies from .002 to .45cents per Kwh.  It really depends on where you live.  So you can't blanket say that US prices are high.
Many of the Chinese bitcoin farms are situated in remote places next to hydro dams and what not, giving them virtually unlimited power for next to nothing price.

Won't help.  The problem is in their payment processor.  If you've already made fiat transactions, those transactions can be replayed essentially.

Better tracking technology has come along, as well as databases that link accounts to identities.  Those didn't exist before, but are now here or on the horizon.  
If you only transact in BTC, and take precautions, it can still be largely anonymous, but most people want to exchange for fiat.  That means (in most cases) giving exchanges your information, which can be used to track your accounts.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:26:20
The amount of currency in the US economy is controlled by a collection of banks that vote on money policies.  This is not so different from how the community votes on consensus rules, just on a larger scale.  The government itself does not control the money supply.  The Fed is a private corporation, although its interests are heavily aligned with the government.

There is no guarantee there will never be more than 21 million.  There could be a fork that changes that in the future.  Not that it's likely, but it could happen.
Further, there's nothing preventing any fiat issuer from having a fixed number of bills in circulation.

Yes, that's the point.  The original chain will die out, and the new forked chain would have the hash.  The fork will only happen if there is 90% approval or so.  If there isn't that approval, the fork will not occur.

There's a lot of things that are not clear by a simple screenshot.
First, is the firm buying more than they usually buy?  If no, then there is no correlation.
Second, is the firm buying for themselves, or for specific customers?  If the latter, then it has nothing to do with their funds, and thus irrelevant.
Third, A lot of people confuse JP Morgan with Morgan Stanley, they are two different companies, not related financially (they separated decades ago).
Fourth, the opinions of the boss do not necessarily relate to a specific trader or traders.  Many of them work as essentially "consultants".

The amount of your transaction is irrelevant.
Right now, it's more profitable for many miners to mine BCH so BTC loses a lot of hashrate, and thus it takes longer to confirm transactions.  This typically recovers after a day or two.

The price difference in China is, as I said, because it's difficult to take advantage of arbitrage due to the difficulty in getting money in and out of said exchanges.
Exchanges tend to stay around the same price because people take advantage of arbitrage to make money, and this tends to equal the price out.  If you can't do arbitrage, the the prices can greatly diverge.  Particularly when the chinese exchanges are becoming isolated.

They can't force you to give up the keys.  They can put you in jail for contempt of court, but they cannot force you to give them up.  There's also the consideration of 5th amendment rights as well (in the US anyways).
Regardless, while they could do this, it's not very efficient.  Individual warrants take a long time to execute, probably 100's of thousands of dollars in man hours.. all to get a few bitcoins?  Unless you're talking 10's of millions of dollars, nobody is going to go through that trouble.
Point in fact, anything YOU can do, the government can try to compel you to do for them.  I say try, because it's up to you, whether you do it.

They can't change their license.  At least not without violating all the previous licenses.  Much of their code is based on older GPL code, and the GPL does not allow you to further restrict the license.  If you could get everyone who has ever contributed code (including Satoshi) to agree to a license change, then sure.. but that's not going to happen for obvious reasons.  Another option would be to rewrite all the code from scratch, but that won't happen either.

There has been some talk about confiscating bitcoin at border crossings, but it seemed like the authorities didn't understand that bitcoin wasn't a physical thing.  For instance, one person was stopped and searched and detained because an agent claimed he "saw bitcoin in the persons bag".  
It's all really stupid stuff.  While it's possible for an agent to search your phone (especially if it's not locked), you should probably just temporarily delete the app and reload it when you need it.  I mean, you're not stupid enough to keep your only copy of the private keys on your phone, right?

Let's see your actual transactions.  Depending on when you bought in June, you could have paid anywhere from $2100 to $3000.  So let's say you paid $3000.  $200 worth would have been .06666667 and if you'd bought in july that price could have been anywhere from $1900 to $2800.  So, let's say you paid $2800 that would mean $200 would be 0.07142857 BTC.
So, that should mean that, if you had paid the absolute highest price possible during those months, you would have 0.13809524BTC in total, not .09188075.  Clearly, there is some BTC missing there.  My calculations did not factor in fees, but they would not amount to anything close to that, as Coinbases fees are either 1.5% or 4% depending on how you bought it.
Unless you didn't buy from Coinbase, and you bought some other way and got scammed.
So, how much SHOULD you have?  0.13809524 at $4200 would be worth $580.  
I doubt you would have made $180 in profit in 2 months in the stock market playing penny stocks.

Bitcoin is money, but isn't "legal tender" in any jurisdiction.  
Imagine you worked a job in the USA, and your boss paid you in Rupees.  You'd have to exchange it for Dollars to use it, even though Rupees are money.  So the argument of "If bitcoin is money, why does it have to be exchanged for dollars" is pointless.

Just because they ban exchanges doesn't mean they're banning mining.  Bitmain can always use offshore exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:31:05
Are you really just dense?  Non-mining nodes validate that the hash is valid for each block.  They assure that the proof of work has been accomplished.  The block is rejected if it's not, therefore cannot be added to the blockchain of that node, and thus cannot be propogated to another node.  
If an agreed upon number of nodes (mining or otherwise) validate that the block is valid, then it's accepted by the clients as "confirmed".
How do you not know this?  Or are you being deliberately dense about the purpose of nodes?
I think you're confusing SPV nodes with "non-mining" nodes.  non-mining nodes can, and often do have full copies of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:45:09
First, that "notice" was a disingenuous political stunt, clearly promoting a bias.
However, it is true that you should not keep your coins on an exchange during a fork, even though Coinbase has said they will support any fork, you may not get immediate access and you also may not have access to bitcoin gold when that fork happens.
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:42:30
I don't think this is recent.  I think NewEgg stopped a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:51:40
Neither miners or nodes can succeed without each other.  While technically miners have to run at least 1 node to mine, if no non-mining nodes were to support a fork, that coin would simply not have any security.  What's more, if 99% of all nodes rejected such miner-only blocks then it would kind of pointless.  You couldn't send any coin to anyone else.
Miners and Nodes have to work together, with (more or less) the same core set of rules for Bitcoin to function.  
Nodes can have any set of rules they want, but if miners don't create blocks that meet those rules, the nodes are useless.
It's like a casino where none of the slot machines accept the tokens being dispensed.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:44:41
If you're not going to use the exchange, what's your point then?  The only way to make money off the difference is arbitrage, that means you need to get money in and out of both the exchange you buy from, and the exchange you sell to.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:07:02
Nodes confirm the blocks.  Thus, they provide security.  Miners create the blocks, nodes validate them.

Almost no pools are PPS.  Most are PPLNS or similar.  Since PPLNS drops shares there isn't a good way to know if you're being paid fairly.

All hashing power would have to be switched to B2X for it to be effective, otherwise it just contributes to the problems caused by BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:22:37
If the majority of the hash power goes to the new chain, it could take months or years to mine a single block on the legacy chain.  How is that not "killing" it?  
You can't do an emergency difficulty adjustment without hard forking either.  So that's a non-starter.  The new chain could have an EDA, but that would also be unlikely.
It will take 2600 blocks for the hashrate to adjust on the legacy chain.  If it loses any significant hashrate, everyone is screwed.  Unless S2X gains 99% of the hashrate and things just continue on...
As for the symbol, the symbol went to the new fork when Ethereum forked (and the old chain got ETC).

You act like these are facts.  They're not.  They're your opinion.  And others have different opinions.  Even core knows that a blocksize increase is necessary at some point, they just disagree that the point is right now.  Again, this is opinion, on both sides.  
It does not seek to 'remove" anyone.  This is the most disingenuous part of this argument.  Nobody can be "removed" here, since it's open source, and nodes can choose which node software they want to run.  You're being mendacious by making this argument, as it's ridiculous and anyone without an agenda would understand that.  It is patently impossible to "remove" anyone that wants to develop for bitcoin.

Whenever I see people who are credited as being an authority on some other financial subject talking about bitcoin, and I see certain key words, it's clear that these people either a) don't understand what they're comparing bitcoin to or b) don't understand bitcoin enough to do a comparison.
For instance, Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, because it does not even remotely resemble ponzi schemes.  People usually see "Oh, hi returns, must be a Ponzi".
bitcoin cannot be an "enron in the making" because Enron was involved in fraudulent accounting.  Bitcoin is a public accounting system that everyone can see, therefore cannot possibly be anything like Enron.
This is not to say there aren't bitcoin based ponzi schemes, nor that there cannot be fraud using bitcoin.  Just that Bitcoin is none of those things.  
It's also not to say that Bitcoin isn't risky.  It is.  But many people are fine with that risk.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, which at 10 minutes per block is every 2 weeks.  Each 2 weeks, because more hashing power has been added to the pool, difficulty continues to rise.

It's impossible for the difficulty to surpass what is possible.  It can only equal what is possible.  
What would happen is that mining would plateau and reach the limit, and could not exceed it.  No more mining power could be added, thus the difficulty could not go up.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:18:29
While it is indeed possible to allow multiple algorithms to be used for PoW, it's effectively impossible to ensure a hash limit for them.  
Imagine this.  ASIC miners hash as much as they can, and reach their limit in 2 minutes... GPU miners take 10 years to complete a block.  No asic mining allowed for 10 years?  
The hashrates would have to somehow be exactly equal, and frankly that isn't going to happen.

If it happens at all, it will likely be before November 23rd, which is the 6 month deadline for the NYA.   My guess is that it won't happen though, as there now seems to be significant FUD going that will create enough uncertainty that it won't achieve the 90+% support it would need to be effective at killing off the original chain.
There is no point in forking if it's going to create yet another viable branch.

They are resistant to any replay protection that requires wallets to be alter their validation.  The method they came up with works for both existing wallets, and new 2x specific wallets.  It's clunky, and can be costly, but if you absolutely need replay protection, it's available.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:22:56
Replay protection is only required if there are two viable chains.  If one chain gets 100% or nearly 100% of the support (hash, exchanges, etc) and the other does not, then it doesn't matter if there is replay protection as the other chain is worthless.
You send a S2X transaction, and someone replays it on the defunct chain.. big deal, it wasn't worth anything.
This is why it doesn't make sense for 2x to happen unless there is near unanimous support for it (and near 0 support for the original chain).
Essentially, not adding replay protection guarantees that it's financially impossible to support more than one chain.  If they added replay protection, a third chain would be created (BCH, BTC, B2X) and split hashpower even more between 3 chains.  
No, any future hardfork that doesn't have near unanimous support is doomed at this point.

You are confusing Multi-Level-Marking (such as Amway) with a Pyramid Scheme.   A Pyramid scheme is a very specific kind of FRAUD, while an MLM is a legal, organizational structure.
In a Pyramid scheme, a central figure recruits investors, with a promise to guarantee them some kind of return on their investment with a period of time.  Then, the schemer takes the money new investors give, and pays it to the older investors.
It relies on a constant stream of new investors to keep the pyramid going.  And will ultimately collapse, since it's not mathematically possible.. you'll eventually run out of new investors, and once you can no longer keep up the facade, the central founder tends to just disappear with the remaining cash.
An MLM is where there is a pyramid of people who receive a certain percentage of profits from a sale of a product.  It's a reward mechanism that encourages others to bring in more salespeople.  As you move up the chain, you have more people under you, thus while you get smaller percentages of each sale, you get many more sales percentages.  This is not illegal because it's a finite structure, with a defined set of rewards, and does not involve the investment of money from those involved (although they certain can buy the products themselves). 
Bitcoin is not even remotely like this in any ways.  There is no central founder, there are no guarantees of return on investment, new money is not paying those old guarantees.  It's simply not a pyramid scheme.
If it were a pyramid scheme, then every currency in existence would be one.  The stock market itself would be one.  
A Pyramid scheme is similar to a Ponzi scheme, however in a Ponzi scheme the victim is unaware that it's a pyramid scheme, while in a pyramid scheme the victim is aware, and is typically sold on the idea as a logical way to make money.
An example of a pyramid scheme is the old emails that used to go around where you're supposed to send $1 to everyone on the list who is above you, and then forward it on to 5 friends.
What *IS* a pyramid scheme, is the US Social Security.  However, this is different because it's a government guaranteed benefit, enshrined in law.
I am in no way trying to claim that all Cryptocurrency investments are legal and above board (certainly, there are scammers out there).  What I *AM* saying is that's not a pyramid or a ponzi scheme, ever.  Those have very specific meaning and refer to a very specific kind of fraud.

@_date: 2017-10-06 15:52:17
There's no such thing as miner-only consensus.  If the full nodes don't agree, then they will reject any mined blocks.  You need 51% nodes as well

So you're saying that if Bitcoin dropped to $20, nobody would sell them for $20?  I think that's naive.  During a crash, people frequently sell at a loss, often a significant loss.  Miners are no different, especially those that are living hand to mouth, or have their entire savings tied up in it.
Ok, so one point is that you can't have bitcoin without the blockchain.  That seems like a fair argument.  Of course, we are now talking about off-chain transactions coming... so i think that argument is not quite true.

Let's look at this from a different perspective.  Since the dollar deflates so fast, who in their right mind would save dollars?
The fact of the matter is, lots and lots of people buy bitcoin and sell bitcoin on a daily basis, if they didn't, there would be no bitcoin to buy.  So why would anyone sell bitcoin ever?  
It's ridiculous to think everyone has the same priorities.

Dude, I just said it had an emergency difficulty adjustment, but here you are saying no, it's because it had an emergency difficulty adjustment...

It's possible.  There has been a lot of talk about certain high profiles withdrawing support, but that seems to be fixated around replay protection.  If it can be proven that replay protection won't be needed because the old chain will be abandoned, then those may well come back into the 2x camp.

How do you know that no exchange will follow the fork?
No, it doesn't take weeks.  BCH took weeks because of the EDA.  And that was high accelerated.  Learn a bit about how this works.
Bitcoin lowers difficulty every 2016 blocks.  At 10 minutes per block this is 14 days.  If hashrate drops in half, then that would mean a block would take a *LOT* longer, 100+ minutes.  So it would take 140 days (average), which if unlucky could be over a year for a difficulty adjustment.  That's *ONE* adjustment.  It would take many adjustments to get it to a reasonable level.  So yes, years.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:49:02
Chain hopping only happens when the profitability of mining one chain over the other switches between chains.  Since there won't be an emergency difficulty adjustment, that won't happen.

Hardly.  There's already $1.2B worth of volume every day as it is.  It already fluctuates several hundred per day.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:04:33
Yes, for varying degrees of profitability.  The D3 was just released a few months ago.  So it's still quite profitable at around $20/day (although Dash profitability has tanked quite a bit since then).    The S9 is still making $10-15/day.  Depending on the price of bitcoin.
But, if you want to buy new... it's 2-3months of wait time (during which the price is going down, down, down) and high probability of dead on arrival (BitMain's quality control is not good).
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:34:30
I suggest you learn how the blockchain works.
Whether or not Bittrex is processing transactions, they still occur on the blockchain.  Nothing gets "lost".  That's the whole point of the blockchain.
As soon as they start processing again, they pick up processing where they left off and read all transactions that have occurred since then.  There is no other way to handle it.

pow change would require.. wait for it.. a hard fork.  Whoever started this stupid talking point didn't think it through.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:27:11
I'm not making any assumption.  The market will follow whatever the exchanges call "bitcoin".  If the exchanges follow one fork or the other, then that's all there is to it.  BTC is whatever the exchanges call it.
Regardless, it only makes sense to fork if it's going to be near unanimous.  The only way to do that is if the legacy chain dies off in the process.  Nobody wants 3 viable forks.
BCH survives because it had (and continues to have) an EDA.  If it didn't, it would still be waiting to solve it's first few blocks.  Neither the current BTC or any 2x version has an EDA, which means one of them will die simply because it will not be profitable to mine it.  Without miners, then the coin cannot be transacted, therefore it will be worthless.
In the unlikely case of a 50/50, or 60/40 or even 70/30 hash split, BOTH chains will die.  It will take YEARS for the difficulty to adjust to levels that would allow for a such massive drops in hash.  That's why it would be unlikely.  Miners would move to whatever chain was most profitable, and once one chain had 51% there would never be a reason to mine the other chain (unlike with BCH, which, due to EDA makes it financially worthwhile to go to the other chain now and again).
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:47:07
No.  Because the blockchain is public, anyone can fork it.  That's how Bitcoin works.
The only kind of coin that is immune to forks are those that are entirely controlled by a single entity.

They only support BCH because BCH had replay protection AND an emergency difficulty adjustment, neither of which the 2x will have.  
No, there will only be one viable chain after the fork.  Whether it's 2x or legacy is yet to be seen.

A large percentage of hash has moved to the BCH chain temporarily (this pendulum swing has been happening since shortly after august 1st).  It will swing back when BCH difficulty becomes too high again.
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:06:16
What is likely to be true is that if there isn't only one active chain after the fork, the fork isn't likely to happen IMO.  Nobody wants a 3rd active chain.
If no exchange will carry it, and no miner will mine it, it will have 0 value.

They can prove you own it when you cash it out.  At some point, you need to associate yourself with it, and at that point is where you are caught.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:35:01
What makes you think there will be multiple chains?  Lack of replay protection makes it financially disastrous to support more than one chain going forward.  If that chain is 2x, then nobody will support 1x and vice versa.
The lack of replay protection ensures that all hash stays on 1x or all hash moves to 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:15:22
Exchanges do their own accounting internally, and you do not "own" any bitcoin until you transfer it to a wallet you control.  Until then, the exchange pools all bitcoin into centralized wallets, and they track your balances on their internal database. 
There is no guarantee that they don't spend that bitcoin somewhere else.  Just like your bank doesn't guarantee that they won't use the dollars you give them to make loans or other investments.  
They only promise to give you the amount you have on account upon request to withdraw it.
The 21 million coin limit has not been reached yet.  New bitcoin is not created when you buy bitcoin.  That bitcoin is already in existence, and they are just selling you some.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:46:11
Because the intention is to have any hard for REPLACE the original chain, replay protection is not planned to be added.  They are talking about maybe doing opt-in replay protection, but no decision has been made for that.
The idea is to completely deprecate the original chain, thus no replay is needed because the original chain will be worthless.  
Whether or not that happens, is yet to be seen.  My prediction, if they do not have 90+% support of miners and exchanges, the fork won't happen.  It's pointless without near unanimous support.

The simple fact is, unless you know where his online bitcoin wallet is, and have the user name and password, as well as any additional verification information they may request, you won't be able to access this money.
While it's possible that he has a wallet on his personal computer, or a hardware wallet.. it's probably unlikely.  
So, unless you know exactly how he bought and saved this bitcoin, you can consider it lost.
