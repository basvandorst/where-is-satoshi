I just used coinbase. The fee was less than two bucks, which was a lot better than some of the charges I was seeing from other exchange methods. 
Thank you!

If I put all my money in, I'd be a lunatic.
The amount I'm able to spare on BTC is a bit different than "all of my money."

Thanks for the offer!
I downloaded what I believe is the "official" client from bitcoin.org. It took a horrendous amount of time to gather all the block information. I'm guessing I can transfer the BTC from my coinbase account to my "main" wallet on my laptop.
We have a couple external hard drives and flash drives throughout the house, so I suspect I'll be making copies and putting them on all of them. A little redundancy never hurt anyone.
One question I have (though I'm definitely interested in whatever tips you have): I just purchased my BTC from coinbase, but it's going to take a few days to get here. I'm guessing my purchase is locked in? For the sake of example, if the market value of BTC doubles, I'm not going to get shipped 5 BTC instead of the 10 I ordered today? Probably a dumb question, but I don't mind looking a little silly to get an answer.

Interesting. Which country?


Try me.

I'm confused. Are you paying the teacher or is he teaching "for free"? 
I also don't understand why you're so angry at OP for taking an interest in potentially reducing the influence banks have on this country. 
Your rage seems misplaced and disproportionate.

You must be an Office Space fan; I see you're getting plenty of use out of your "Jump to Conclusions" mat.


I have very little BTC. I don't know where I even intimated that I might have some in the post you're replying to.


What does spending money on a teacher versus an investment have to do with the safety of public schools? How does this even relate to your original tirade?


1. University isn't for everyone. This is true even of the more privileged parts of the world.
2. There are alternatives to university that lead to success in life.
3. The vast majority of current university students don't come from private schools.
4. Even though all the above is true, a poor kid can finish public school, get into a university and graduate. I know because I did.


Do you know how much private schools cost? $5,000 is a drop in the bucket. Why are you giving this guy grief because he invested his own money instead of pledging it towards someone else's kid's education?


Since when is education a luxury for the rich? More importantly, do you think the quality of education a teacher working for free is going to approach the quality of education of a teacher who doesn't have to worry about bills and...y'know...eating?
I don't get why you're having such an emotional reaction to someone else's personal business. If you take exception to OP saying he feels like he's helping change the world because he's not doing it in the way you'd prefer, I think that's your problem and no one else's.
You certainly haven't brought much reasoning to the table, anyway.
EDIT: Oh. You're just a troll. Nevermind.
