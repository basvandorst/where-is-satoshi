I just meant that when one files, one doesn't choose between bankruptcy and liquidation. One chooses between Chp. 7 Liquidation; Chp. 11 Restructuring (which can include liquidation); and Chp. 13 income based debt repayment, among lesser others. 
Your definition of bankruptcy is really a definition of insolvency. Bankruptcy is a legal status obtained by filing for bankruptcy under any of the chapters. There is no general "bankrupt" status outside of the chapters. Rather, a person is deemed insolvent when their debts exceed assets to the point where they are unable to pay debts when due. Ahhh pedantics.

Just an FYI, liquidation is a form of bankruptcy.

Meh, debit card processing isn't really a market anyway. Visa and MasterCard are basically a duopoly. That's not free market competition. There really isn't a viable alternative available. Even paypal and square run on the debit/cc rails.

I don't really get why you brought CUs up? Especially without any prompting or explanation why CUs are relevant to a discussion of whether public banks exist. 
OP asked whether there are any public banks. You said, essentially, "no, but credit unions are close." full stop. No, "here's why CUs function like public banks," or "CUs are community banks which are less likely to have the same problems that the big national banks have," or "CUs treat you right." 
Let me translate this to deli meats, the universal language. OP asked something like: "Are there any turkey sandwiches?" 
You respond by saying "The closest thing would be a bologna sandwich. Although a bologna sandwich isn't made out of turkey meat. And anyone eating a turkey sandwich rather than a bologna sandwich is doing it wrong." 
WHY BRING UP BOLOGNA SANDWICHES, HUH?

Just an FYI, Reg CC governs funds availability. See these links for a better idea: [Next DayAvailability]( [Availability Schedule]( [Exceptions]( Note the large deposit exception. From the customer's perspective, it does seem like it takes forever but you should know that it usually takes a bank around 6 days to clear a check. 
The government, in the interest of customer satisfaction, mandated that banks had to release those funds even though the bank hasn't yet received the funds from the payor/payor bank. This means that the payee's bank (your bank in this case) is taking on the risk that the check is bad. The strict schedule was also supposed to incentivize development of faster check clearing programs. 
Alas, banks really haven't done that. It doesn't have to take six days in this modern age. But it does.

Credit unions are not public at all. Nor are they close to being owned by the govt.

Yeah.... The federal reserve board of governors is 100% a federal agency. The 12 regional banks are federally chartered corporations. There are a handful of federally chartered corporations out there. IIRC: USPS, Tennessee valley authority, and amtrak(?).

But the shareholders can't do jack shit! And the managers of the fed don't owe the shareholders any duties! It is so dissimilar to the normal shareholder/mgmt relationship that it doesn't even make sense to call them the same thing.

I'm not familiar with Chinese anti-money laundering laws. What is the offense actually defined as? Simply trying to conceal the true payee? 
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:02:05
Is this actually money laundering? Anyone have a cite?

Google is under no obligation to issue a dividend to shareholders. So no, you are not entitled to a share of the profits. You are a residual claimant on the assets of the firm. Meaning: you get whatever is left in the trough after every other little piggy eats.

Come on, a Wikipedia article on bailor/Bailee liability? Why even post this if you don't know what you're talking about?

The likely explanation is that it tripped a SAR flag ($10k in cash withdrawn within 24 hours, where the deposit was in a foreign currency, Btc or USD, and who knows what else) and now it's frozen until they can clear the SAR which could take awhile. They are subject to Canada's KYC/AML laws so this type of this should be somewhat expected until Btc/gold transactions become more routine.

Just an FYI because people seem to be confused. The Fed would look into btc for a few reasons. I imagine BitCoin and PayPal were lumped together in the statement/article because one of the Fed's core purposes is to maintain the stability of the nation's payment system. I don't mean to be glib here and I'm sure this will be hashed out in the courts but *btc is a payment system*. It is like cash, checks, PayPal, debit, and credit cards regardless of all the cool tech behind it. At the very least, it is an open question which the Federal Reserve Board is *obligated by statute and regulation* to resolve. They very may well decide that BitCoin's internal rules provide sufficient protection/stability. However, they can't *not* look into it.

Meh, my general rule is that if I have heard something is a good investment and am tempted, it is a bubble. I am not an investment pro. If I've heard of it, a few million other idiots have too.

If you unfamiliar with this style of analysis, I recommend wiki'ing chart analysis. It is generally bullshit, but bullshit that a lot of people believe. If enough people trade on the same analysis then knowing that analysis is helpful.

does anyone else think it's a problem that no one in this thread actually takes bitcoin critics seriously?
I think the main critique here is that Bitcoin offers too much transactional security, which actually ends up being bad for society and people in the long run. The thought being that the small transactional insecurities which exist today bind us all together because we have to trust eachother to make the system work. For instance, before debit cards and online banking, if a check bounced, you became known as untrustworthy in the community. The transactional insecurities inherent in a check payment system prompted a collective social response. The shame that came with a bounced check trickled down to other aspects. For instance, it was/is considered very rude to not cash a check promptly because it exposed the drafter to overdraft risk if the check was cashed at an unexpected time. So, from these simple inefficiencies a whole host of social benefits was gained: better money management, prompt payment, and better financial knowledge. 
 If you take away the transactional insecurity you may gain a few immediate benefits but you also lose some of the social benefits. 
But hey, its a tradeoff. One that I think is worth it. But that's just me. 
What worries me is that everyone here just blows off this type of critique. That's a problem because it tells me that (1) everyone here is a zealot who can't see the other side; or (2) y'all aren't that smart.

So I guess my question is then: why spend BitCoins now for an item when they have been going up in value? It will only go up in value because there are a finite amount of BitCoins and more and more people are trying to buy them (assuming people value BitCoins at all). If I had to choose between buying a camera with USD or with BitCoin, I would pay in USD because I can be relatively confident that the value of a BitCoin will fluctuate (for better or worse) while $1 will still be roughly $1.

Ummmm that's why they are looking into it. One of the mandates of the fed is to oversee payment systems. BitCoin, PayPal, checks, and cash are payment systems...

Does no one else see the inherent stupidity/irony in having btc/usd trades go through a central clearinghouse? What is the point of using btc, a currency designed to obviate the need to use a clearinghouse, if everything runs through a clearinghouse?!? How have I mitigated the credit risk at all?
