Awesome,  downloaded and excited to see how it works.  Great job btw,  it's people like you (and the people who actually started cryptocurrencies)  who will change the world.

Thank you. I hope so too. Onwards an upwards! Even as just as a spectator, what an awesome thing to see. Giving everyday people a chance for a better future. Some lives have been changed forever because of this   “magic internet money”  Giving the power back to the people. When not straining under crippling money problems anymore, big changes for the best will happen hopefully

The amount of time and effort people put into helping out and spreading information is incredible. And support for newbies is astonishing. I haven’t yet come by someone bitching and moaning about a newb asking the same question... again and telling them to refer to the info on the side.  Faith in humanity in all walks of life is restored.

You're doing something incredibly amazing! I won't suggest any specific charity,  but please include some Austism related ones.  
The numbers of Autistic children (and adults) being diagnosed is on the rise and they and their families are in constant struggle to deal with it and need so much support. So any Autism research or support foundations would be incredible,  please!

Thank you. I’m a “smalltimer” but happy to get at least my toe in the door. Got my parents and fam looking into it and they are all interested. None of them even remotely tech savvy (anything more than switching on pc and using internet is for the “pros” ) but they are definitely interested.

I'm so new to this. Here I was thinking Coinbase is safe to keep my coins. I only have a small amount,  should I get a wallet?  Any good recommendations for wallets for an Aussie? 
Good luck getting it back soon.
