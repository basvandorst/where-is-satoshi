The bank of america thing kind of got me interested.  What is your take on that?  Maybe also I'm just watching too many hype videos on XRP.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:16:17
I'm in it for the long run.  I'm more looking at when my parents are gone and I'm alone.  So 10 years minimum is what i'm looking at right now.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:48:55
To be honest, it was 30 cents.  I have like 50 bucks in it and 200 saved up for other investments in crypto.  I just want to get as much input as possible from guys and girls that have experience in this.  If I lose it all I'm no worse off than I am now, but I want to know at least I tried to get in when this all took off.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:33:46
Really? Only 1%? That is crazy.  Thank god I'm only 50 bucks into xrp.
@_date: 2019-07-29 02:28:52
Thanks for bringing me back down from the moon.  It's hard to not get lost in all the hype videos from all the other altcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:01:08
Ok, that makes a lot of sense.  I just subscribed to Andreas Antonopoulos and I will be watching his videos all night tonight.  I can do absolutely 100 per month.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:39:06
Thank you so much!  This is exactly the type of information I'm looking for.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:58:00
I feel so late to the game, and there is so much info out there pulling me in different directions to different coins.  My head is going to explode man!
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:29:25
You are amazing! I will figure it out.  But really you didn't need to do that! Thank you so much.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:22:05
See how much I know lol
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:45:12
Step one is to live with your parents lol.  I don't have a cell phone plan, just an old phone I use on wifi. When I get the urge to spend on something I will go out and wheel myself around for a few hours and get some exercise, and to think or listen to a podcast or something.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:25:47
Is XRP not worth it? Maybe 50/50 in bitcoin and xrp?
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:18:38
I might have to check that book out.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:06:28
Ok, that makes sense.  I'm already learning a lot from you guys.
@_date: 2019-07-29 10:22:53
I really enjoy Joe Rogan and I also listen to a lot of Jordan Peterson.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:19:21
I think I saw something on that.  They said to shoot for .28 even.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:16:09
I'm so glad you made money.  It just looks like I have been too scared of bitcoin when it is the gold standard.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:21:38
I'm willing to lose 100 dollars.  That is my fun money for the month. I have no debt, and my bills are paid.
@_date: 2019-07-29 02:27:04
thank you so much! 11% really puts it in perspective. I'm still early, I just want off the government teat lol.  One step at a time.  But you know how it goes in your dreams.  But then you wake up.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:27:06
That is an amazing point on xrp. I never thought of that, and that is the reason I came here.
@_date: 2019-07-29 00:26:41
That is another thing on my mind.  Keeping it on an exchange worries me.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:42:49
I'm going to study both of those links.  Thank you for those!
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:28:42
I'm not able to work yet, the us government will not let me if I want to keep my healthcare.  Is this something I can use with out a wage?
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:51:47
exactly.  I'm 41 and I wish I had understood digital assets 5-6 years ago. We really are not that late man.  Invest what you can that does not add debt or risk to your family.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:52:20
Does cash app have the ability to transfer to a hardware wallet?  I swear I never saw that option.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:15:20
Nice man, all bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:03:37
Just ordered a ledger nano s from the ledger website.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:07:03
Yeah, Better than 20% though lol.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:02:09
You're right.  I have made a goal to own .3 of a bitcoin at this very moment.  Anything after that to me is gravy.  I will be sure to watch out for those scams.  I'll just keep buying and hardware wallet and forget.  I really feel when I'm 55 I will be off of government aid.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:52:29
What are some examples of popular scams?
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:41:22
This should be received well.
@_date: 2019-08-04 10:12:55
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:35:11
I have seen some things on there.  Gamer girls back then were fat and gross and willing to show it.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:30:54
I got you.  The old saying of if it's too good to be true it is.  Just to be clear though, buying off of coinbase and moving to a hardware wallet is the best way to do it right now correct?
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:19:33
Smart man.  I might stop buying XRP after next month and go full into bitcoin.  I just wanted a little spread.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm torn at times.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:22:34
Is there anything could really hurt bitcoin?  XRP could be killed off by JPM coin or Libra down the road, correct?  Does Bitcoin have that kind of competition?
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:41:38
Can I have 1 bitcoin you greedy bastard!?
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:24:27
BSV?  I'm not sure what that is.
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:31:10


That is what worries me about JPM coin.  JPM can be viewed as a compromise between the governments and the banks?  Or am I missing something?  Will each bank have to have it's own crypto?
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:54:40
It's crazy the potential that is there.  I have not been this excited about anything since I dialed up and played my first multiplayer game as a kid, or saw my first tits on msn messenger.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:05:24
What do I have to stream myself doing? My girl is kinda of freaky and we will do anything for bitcoin. Also I'm very disabled and that is some fetish shit.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:48:33
I know XRP is a bit of a gamble.  I'm just trying to give myself a shot. I have been living on sub $800 per month my whole life and even if I only made 20 grand that is life changing for me.
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:23:28
I can't get cash app to scan the back of my ID to activate withdraws to my wallet.....
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:32:36
Really?  I'm glad I'm not well versed on that at all.
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:02:49
lmao.  How about horse manure? That's a bridge asset to some vegetables correct?
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:06:10
My dreams are crazy.  Lucky for me I have a girlfriend who puts out still.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:46:16
That was me, just trying to get a meatball sub from subway. Please ignore.
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:25:57
is this the correct story?
