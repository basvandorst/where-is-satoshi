When the value of something whose only value is 'is valuable' inflates 200% in a month, it's probably a good sign that it's time to sell before the inevitable burst. Anyone who thought this was sustainable growth needs to learn more about investment before speculating on currency.

I wonder if the beanie baby fanatics blamed the price guides for crashing their market?
comic books crashed because of Wizard, people!

Yeah. Bitcoin Gambler is probably the guy who screwed himself the worst-  if he'd been smart, he would have liquidated all of his btc at 250 instead of just pulling out 30k worth, and then reinvested when the market bottomed out.
This is why you trust your retirement funds to professionals, people!

the value of a currency replacement is irrelevant

A good position to have. I'm just concerned for you! I know that there's a lot of bitcoin boosters on this SR who are convinced Bitcoin is here to stay, but it's always been a volatile currency without anything to back it but it's own investors. A major run is all it's going to take to kill it. It doesn't even have the value of having useful secondary properties.
It's beanie babies all over again, and we saw what happened to the investors who sold their portfolios to stock up on *those*. If the crash is coming, get out while it's still high. Or you're going to be the guy stuck with 86 Garcias in a box in his garage.

The only thing holding back bitcoin as a currency is that almost all of bitcoin is held by speculators holding the currency for it's value as a currency that nobody uses as a currency.

Yeah. This is the gambler at the Casino who won't cash out when he's up. What a fucking catastrophe.

OP, you should sell everything you have while you still can, if you can. The currency is crashing. You are going to hate yourself if you had the chance to retire off one month of saving and blew it because you were holding out for a bounceback.

The difference between a good investor and a bad investor is that a good investor knows when to walk away...

That's what they said about Beanie Babies and Comic Books.

Investing works on calculated risk. Did you (or anyone for that matter) really think that that growth was sustainable?
