Can we start showing mtgox addresses where we sent btc? Then some skilled devs around could start creating a "gox panoramic" and maybe in the end we could understand 10% of all this s thing... this is my fisrt one:
received  my 15.22761763 BTC on 6/26/12 02:09

maybe you not using your "instant visa card" my children received for free at 12 years old... ok... be happy...
(btc economy? mars life?)
Just because we made a lot of money with some s! it doesn't mean we grow blind with greed on that...
as said before... be happy...

Dogs? Are you serious?
I am in a EU but I can spot some children that can use additional food and books in my country.
Can someone prefer to help dogs over people?
Next you will say Hitler was a nice guy because he cried about is canary death and never saw those "untermench" 6 million around being killed.

I am in EU. I can pay everywhere with a debit card with instant approval and without fees (fees only on merchant side - who cares about that?). Why would I wait for "confirmations" of some kind of "really new" payment system? Can you all grow up please? BTC is nice to mine and day trade (aka fool the noobs). But paying with it? Are you serious?
Edit 1
You all don't read it... my transaction fee is 0 (aka zero). Every month I send money (2eurk+-) to another European Country (inside EU) with 0 (aka zero) fee. Every day I pay with my debit card everywhere with 0 (aka zero) fee.
Are you in a country with fees on atms? Change your country banking system. Change your country gov.
BTC is wonderful for a lot of things... payments are not one of those. At least in EU.
Note 1: All my life I was somewhere in EU. So I can't judge or talk about other "freedom flag countries" banking systems.
Note 2: I love the volatility of BTC. I am living on that last 3 months with 10-20 minutes work every day

"people" don't know about btc, xrp, ltc, aur, ppc. You do. I do. Wake up. First we need to make "people" aware of cryptocurrencies... then (maybe) next... lets try to avoid greed... (mortal sin / bad karma / mind blinder)

No satire. No Trolling. No teenager kids anymore. Just true life. I live in a poor EU country and never pay move money around (if &lt; 12500 EUR once). Why would I need whatevercoin for that? Whatevercoins are good for payments if you need move big dirty money or if you live in a country that allows banks to charge you $1 to get $10 on atms. But believe me... if you need to pay to move your money in your country you must change bank/country/gov. BTC is nice to daytrade/bagholding... You can wake up and find you got +1000 USD or EUR while sleeping... just because you warm up your house mining btc last winters... but please don't tell me to use it to pay bus... I have "real" coins for that...

bitcoin will never grow as a "currency" because it is a "cryptocurrency" as some others... so first of all it must be able to be usable as a cryptocurrency on webs (then, maybe - just maybe - can try to be a "very special" non webs currency... but instant as my visa debit...? maybe btc 0.9.9.3 in 15 year if waiting for btc devs...)
but please don't take me wrong... I love the USD/EUR btc gave me... I have 17 monitors and 14 cpus around me paid with btc dreams...
sorry... 13 cpus

It was 1985. They gave me debit and credit cards for free when they saw my first monthly pay check. I refused the credit card. Still not using that "virtual money" (unreal money).
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:32:39
So BTC is history? Nice.
Can we then talk about present or (such wow) the glorious future? Like ?
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:11:58
Virtual currency?
Is this a joke?
USD &amp; EUR and whatever are just printed on paper.
I paid some electricity bills to get for this... I am the "real people" minting this...
Can any "gov currency" in de whole world say this?
Dont think so...

Think just 1/10 second.
If he is THE ONE and don't want to show it we don't want to know that.
Its like our (crypto)father saying don't know us.
If he isn't THE ONE the less we talk about him sooner the circus will go away from him. 
Its like our (crypto)father saying don't know us.
We can't win this. Ever...
So lets daytrade...
