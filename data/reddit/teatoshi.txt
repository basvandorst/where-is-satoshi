Florida has never really had a great political landscape, too much corruption from the local level all the way up. Adrian Wyllie would be great for bitcoin, but the media isn't even giving him a shot in the debates. Rick Scott's son-in-law is a managing partner for BitAngels but Crist is likely to win and his outlook on bitcoin is the most unclear. Luckily we do have some Bitcoin startups in Florida like Cryptsy but we have to attract more.

No, this kind of stuff that makes it to the front page is a waste of space. It detracts from real events that are going on in the bitcoin community. I posted an article yesterday about the only governor who will probably get elected that is accepting bitcoin, but stupid things like this and simple questions that can be answered by google searches make it to the front page.

People and their biases, the guy is clearly misinformed. If he wants to he can find out that the overwhelming majority of the high paying jobs went to the education and health services sector. While the energy sector was pretty much tied with the professional and business services and the finance &amp; real estate industry.

My skin has been getting thicker but you don't understand the amount of effort I put into this one. Getting politicians on record is pretty difficult, originally the Abbott campaign wanted to just have me quote a spokesperson but I told them I didn't think the community would appreciate that. Stockman is one of the most vocal political advocates of Bitcoin. Tod Beardsley is a security genius, he was just quoted by Reuters yesterday for the 'Bash' software bug. Dustin Trammell is one of the earliest adopters of bitcoin, and he has even been accused of being Satoshi, he wrote a blog post denying it all. And Paul Snow organized the Texas Bitcoin Conference and is the President of the Texas Bitcoin Association. When it comes to credibility all these guys have it and you don't know how long it takes to research them, get introduced and get their contact.

I just told Tim Draper your joke, and he loved it. I'm a student at Draper University.

Note taken. Thank you for retracting your statement, I really write for the community so your comment hurt me because I put my best effort into this piece. It took a great deal of time to gather the opinions of all these people and I wanted to show the differing view points other states were taking. It takes a lot of guts to admit one is wrong, so I commend you for that.

Yes, it could use a question mark, but that shouldn't distract from all the points I am trying to make in the article. 
If you want to look at my facebook I actually have a picture with President Obama and was in the UF chapter of College Democrats, but I choose to cite these Republicans because they are actually doing something for Bitcoin in their state, while not many Democrats have stepped up to the plate. So there goes your Young Republicans argument. You are part of the problem in Washington where one side can't work with the other because you are so close-minded and once labels are attached your brain shuts down.
Also, I made sure that the jobs created weren't low wage jobs and specifically put that graphic in the article that shows Texas is adding jobs in all wage quartiles. 
The Max Keiser citation was just in regards to BitLicense and was among many so I don't think that defects from that point I am trying make there either. You're argument is filled with so many fallacies that no one should take it seriously, but thank you for saying it is good and well-researched unlike your statements.

who said you had to have to do 50%, you can do 5% or none at all and just use the bank account. People would rather hold money in USD than any other currency. Plus getting a set amount of money invested into a variety of assets is a great way to do dollar cost averaging. Most people aren't avid traders and can't tell tops or bottoms and they would likely loss money gambling in such a way.
