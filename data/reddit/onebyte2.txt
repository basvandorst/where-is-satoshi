I am going to be short and to the point.
Besa Mafia is not a scam.
The articles claiming it was a scam, are undercover cops who are trying to scare people away from using it because they can't shut it down.
Or they might claim that is a scam to create a controversy story to promote the site, to prove in the end that it was legitimate even if they pretend at some point that is was a scam .
My logical argument is that the so called leacked database is a notepad text edited version of some old partial database dump of garbage, users who had pending orders or were in the middle of being completed
The proof that **it is NOT a scam**
*  **It has a working site**, where members can comunicate with each other via internal messeging system
*  **It has demand** , hundreds of customers placed orders and sent bitcoins, this can be proved on the blockchain
* **It has supply** , hundreds of gang members signed up, desperate to do services like beating, killing and set fire to cars, they took orders from the besa admins and from the customers, see the videos of burning cars for proof
So, you have customers on one hand, you have gang members on the other hand who did burned cars and beated people, you have videos on you tube, and a working messaging system, and yet you claim it was a scam.
What stopped customers from talking to gang members to do jobs I ask?
The claims that the site is fake, are based on fake database
* **the database is notepad text** , there is no real database there, but text and zip of pictures, anyone could have editeed that before upload
* **database contains hard to belive messages** , these are cleary fictious messages, do you really belive that some people say 'this is my wife, her picture, info,' kill her instead of just providing name and picture? why do they need to specify its their wife?
Do you really think that FBI so mighty and powerful need to make some account on besa mafia and beg for info from admins? Do you really think that fbi would belive the admins don't cheat them with fake or partial info?
Do you really think that this is the way FBI works?
You are really stupid then.
FBI doesn't make accounts on such sites, if they do, they don't say they are fbi.
They could make accounts to see the interface, or hack the site, but they don't say they are fbi give them info
So, anyone thinking the database dump is real, is plain stupid.
There are a few stupid journalists, which readed the fake database, and concluded that Besa mafia is fake.
And hundreds of other sites just took over the article without thinking at all, proving they are stupid as well.
I hope I proved that the site is working and real, because it has all ingredients, customers, gang members, and a messaging system, and the database is fake, because has stupid messages that are not possible in real life
So if you want the Besa Mafia site down, just hack it, take it down, and stop being lame about it claiming that is fake based on fake database with edited text messages where people say 'i am anonymous but here is my wife kill her'

You people around here are really stupid. Besa Mafia was not a scam, a few journalists claim that it was a scam in order to promote it while keeping flying it low on the radar of FBI
My points saying is not a scam are:
- they have many customers who paid large amounts of bitcoins; however no customer complained anywhere, they could have used free wifi or fake usernames but no complaints whatsoever, meaning their orders were fulfilled
- they have many gang members signing up on their service, desperate to do jobs for money, they completed orders from admins like burning cars and from customers
So, how exactly was this a scam?
You have a lot of customer on one hand with orders paying money, and you have a lots of gang members signing up to provide services for real, check out the videos of burning cars, and you have an system of comunication between customer and gang members because they could message themselves through the website using the internal system
So basically your claim of being a scam is based on some fake database leack that contains notepad text of messages where people say 'I am anonymous but this is my wife, detail, pictures, kill her' or 'I am from FBI please send me info about customers'
You are so stupid to belive someone is really so stupid to say this is my wife kill her?
Even if the site would have been fake, there was NO WAY FOR PEOPLE TO SIGNUP AND SAY this is my wife kill her, or such things
This proves clearly that the so called dump database is fake edited text version of some old garbage partial dump of the database

Besa Mafia is real and it is owned by Chris Monteiro, owner of Pirate.London
Chris Monteiro pretends to fight his own site, in order to keep the FBI away from the site and from him
He says the site is a scam to keep FBI from spending money and budgets into inevstigating
But the site is real. It has real customers who pay, real gang members who do orders like burning cars, see the video dedicated to Pirate.London
The database dump is fake, it was exported by Chris from an old database to text, then he deleted completed customers and messages, from 1000 customers remaining less than 300 in the fake dump
He then edited the text to make it look like the fake dump proves the Besa Mafia is fake, so that FBI would leave alone his site
All kind of drug dealers and criminals know his site is real and signup there to use services, some people order and other people provide services
Proof that the Besa Mafia is owned by Chris Monteiro is
- the same logical scheme is both on Besa Mafia and Pirate London, proving that Chris made them both
- besa mafia has google analytics just view the source, and has the same google id tag as here on Pirate London, basically both besa mafia and pirate london belong to the same google analytics account and I doubt that Besa Mafia admins wanted Chris to know their visitors and stats it proves that Chris owns Besa Mafia
- gang members who signup to provide services are asked by chris to do a car burn dedicated to his site, Pirate.London
After gang members do the car burns, Chris gives them order from customers, so there are no complaints from customers on the Internet
Besa Mafia is a real hitmen for hire site, desguised as a scam, this is the best way to keep a hitmen for hire protected from fbi
Is like painting a real gun to look like a toy, with yellow muzzle, and then you can waive it in front of cops and say this is a toy, and you don't get shot
Chris Monteiro is a smart guy who pretend to fight his own site, and who says about the site that is a scam to keep FBI away
And the criminals use it easily without being discovered

Yes, the leacked database is fake as shit, some 9 years old child edited it in notepad and added lots of messages like 'this is my wife kill her' or things that no sane person would ask
If someone wants to kill his wife, he doesn't have to say is his wife.
He just signup with some random username, enter the details of the target, name, picture, etc, and doesn't have to say what relation it has to her to avoid being traced
So the very fact that there were such dumb messages into the leacked database that was just notepad text it proves it was fake or edited
Lots of the usernames in the fake database dump had the status pending approval, and the messages are fake beyond any human logic, 
no one would say this is my wife
the FBI doesn't make some account on shitty site, begging for info about customers, if they do some account they act undercover without telling they are fbi, or if they want info they hack the server and get it, don't beg some admins for info that could be fake or partial
so, a database claiming messages from fbi that was an user there, or people who saith this is my wife, is fake as shit

is not a scam is a legitimate site and is promoted as a scam to keep fbi and police away
if you signup as gang member providing services you can see you get real orders from customers and you make money

They are just claiming is a scam to keep the customers out of it.
However it was true that many gang members signed up to provide services, some even burning cars, beating people and killing.
And customers never complained. So it wasn't really a scam
