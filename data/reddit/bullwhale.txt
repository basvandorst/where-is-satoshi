The big bang theory lesson, buy a hardware wallet and keep it in a safe place or miss out on being a cryptonaire.

Here is the last paragraph OP is referring too:


I first got into bitcoin back in 2011 because of an informative lecture this organization did. It's very nice to see them grow.

I saw this on r/CompanyBattles, and thought you all would find it funny.

Cryptonaire saved my ass when I saw that last night! Everything was up but not bitcoin. When they changed it I quickly put my altcoins back into bitcoin. Next thing I know all the altcoins started taking a dump. From a year or so of following them, they put USDT typically when there is a dump coming. So they caught the last night's bearish market before it even happened. God bless Cryptonaire!

Personally, I am extremely picky. The second I found out about bitcoin was in early 2010. I read up on it and loved the idea. Here is a little laugh for you. I thought I was part of a handful of "cool" people; until I realized there were communities of bitcoin lovers! Which was awesome. 
The supply was capped at a specific amount. Decentralization was the future for a global people currency/store of wealth. I knew that with in time, you will have a bunch of people that want to make the "next bitcoin" but I made sure not to fall for it and to be extremely picky. Well I am happy I did that, because after 7 years bitcoin hit $6K. However if there is one cryptocurrency I am keeping a close eye on; its Monero. When Monero reaches to the point of smooth multisig, official mobile wallet and most of all hardware wallet. That would be groundbreaking. Not for cryptocurrency but for Cryptography in general. I hope there could be more collaboration between the two in the future. However for now and forever, bitcoin stole my heart.

Imagine the amount of people bitcoin made wealthy and gave them the freedom of their wealth. Everyone had the option to use this opportunity and still have this opportunity. Economic oppression and governing financial control is still at large, can you imagine how insaturated the demand is and we're already witnessing heights of 6K USD. Just remember the supply is limited and there are billions of people in need of bitcoin and it's vision. All it takes is **awareness**, **education**, **contribution** and **belief**.

No, I'm not sure where you read that. I think it would be smart to understand the settings of what I wrote and not include anything irrelevant.
