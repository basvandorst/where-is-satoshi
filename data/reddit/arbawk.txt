10 seconds late he goes on to say: "You didn't say sell everything and buy bitcoin."
Talk about hearing comprehension man...

So cryptocurrency is the racetrack for racetracks?
Where does ETH, LTC, REQ and the countess others fit into your analogy?

Where will we be able to monitor the CBOE futures market prices? Are the contracts publicly visible?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:10:05
Around 15:00 my dude

Yeah fair enough. It's also for entertainment purposes as it causes listeners to shout at their tvs. Apparently it worked on us as we're here talking about it.

Okay I didn't get that those were the 3 contracts available.

Are you in another country? Is it a currency thing?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:14:34
So you have it all figured out u/jayjay59?

I don't think your judgement is fair.
Bitcoin is deflationary. Only finitely many coins will be mined. As the value of the bitcoin economy increases (population increases, new jobs are created, more value is added to the global economy, etc.), the value of each coin has to go up over time.
Granted, we haven't reached this equilibrium point - far from it. But you have to agree that in the hypothetical situation that all the world's money was in Bitcoin, then the situation I described above would occur: 1btc increases in value over time, and you are disincentivized from spending unless necessary.
Obviously right now the price increase is driven by supply/demand. But that increase won't end EVEN IF the entire world has all its money in bitcoin, and so you are still not incentivized to sell back to another currency.
As time passes and the bitcoin market becomes more stable, you're able to purchase more goods with bitcoin with less effort, there will be less and less of a reason to use fiat currency. The increase in value of the coin will still exist without selling it.
Why in the world would you sell BTC for USD if you can do nearly everything with BTC? Your money is only going to be worth more over time...
Forgive me if I'm way off, but refrain from condescending remarks, and explain to me why what I've described isn't true.

Those are all good questions which I share concern about.
However, Bitcoin being deflationary means it's value will always go up. There will never really be a good time to sell. Why would you want other currency whose value isn't increasing?
This leads to a market where consumerism is disincentivized, and you only really buy when you need to. Overall, this seems to be a good thing. The current economy relies on wasteful purchases. But a perfect system should punish it.

If I'm not mistaken, it's also deflationary with no BTC being lost.
As the value of the global economy increases (more people born, jobs created, resources discovered, technological improvements, etc.), the number of bitcoin in circulation stays fixed. And so the value of each bitcoin has to increase accordingly.
Please correct me if this logic is fallacious.
