He said all other methods are a gamble. Holding is a gamble too.

Crypto Jedi on youtube has a series of videos on GM. Look it up, good ones.
Also, look up what a ponzi is too.

Somebody new will not. Hence we need clarification.

Thanks. I hope we both learnt something here.

But you wrote that they: "rent IT spaces in various countries, buy servers and graphics cards and netwoking equipment, pay salaries, advertising, travel, etc."
So they do have actual operations. In ponzi you would only have advretising and travel.
That being said, it is a very poor investment, and people should stay away.

"If you want to profit off crypto, the safest method is just to buy and hodl. Anything else is a gamble..."
"Anything promising returns period is a scam."
You just contradicted yourself. Holding is a gamble too.

2 of 3 pics have power supply. So it is included, right?
Your listing does not say 'power supply not included'.
U the scammer.  Listing item with PSU and not including it.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:56:47
This is your best option.  Unfortunately you unintentionally described the item as containing PSU, so yeah... out full amount or just the PSU cost, assuming buyer chooses to cooperate.
Good luck, we learn from mistakes, right?
