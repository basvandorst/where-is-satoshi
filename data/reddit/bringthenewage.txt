be warned if you are selling anything that gives players an advantage  over others it violated the EULA of minecraft and they have started cracking down on it.

looks good how do i actually download it
@_date: 2014-10-07 22:40:47

yes but in order for bitcoin to become mainstream this as a limitation needs to have something in place to negate it 
@_date: 2014-12-22 19:41:38
thats kind of a massive floor like to the extend where this is something that means bitcoin can never be a proper currency, i mean how banks manage money isnt perfect but at least it isn't all lost forever when someone dies

@_date: 2014-12-22 21:25:07
i doubt this is a particularly common occurrence and its kind of beside the point, people die all the time for the most part banks have a system in place for transferring their assets to the family 
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:56:38
hmm if i sell now i only make a 100% profit.. I WANT MORE!!!
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:26:50
people are idiots and ill take what i can get 
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:17:22
so if someone died and they had bitcoin in a passworded wallet thats it? its gone? 
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:28:16
yeah idk what happened there was an update to the 1 cliant for it and everyone lost all there coins
@_date: 2014-09-07 08:38:36
why are you a deer?
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:03:07
what if someone forgets the password for there wallet how can they get back in? 
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:27:13
i didnt manage to selll them all 
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:58:03
yeah it is
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:16:14
so you put a sticker on it? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:03:51
eh im still up about $120 on when i bought mine so i bought when it was so low the price can do pretty much anything and i still make a profit 
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:34:20
see this is where this community falls down some one offers their experience and gets down voted to hell, why the hell do i even bother 
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:01:29
im sorry but if the community is the best thing we have going for us then we are fucked this is one of the most hostile community iv come across on Reddit and by all means down vote me to hell for saying this but Dogecoin's community is a hell of a lot friendlier 
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:29:44
i used to sell infinitecoin, which i mined in the low millions, at $300 for 10,000 coins. People are unbelievably stupid considering 10,000 of them was worth about $1.30. So don't knock the alt coins... just abuse the hell out of them 
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:26:22
i didnt manage to sell them all and i got my own student loan to pay back :D
@_date: 2014-12-22 19:42:11
this is kind of a big problem with bitcoin don't you think? 
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:25:20
@_date: 2014-10-07 22:07:47
people are idiots i used to sell a literally infinite alt coin called infinite coin for $300 per 10,000 when i mined 34,000,000 in an hour edit: i didnt get to sell them all i only made about $12,000 from what i got around to selling

ok here's the situation my dad had some bitcoin he died and now we are trying to work out if we can recover it so its a bit late to modify the wallet 
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:32:14
ok here's a tip in life NEVER OPEN A .JAR FROM AN EMAIL! 
@_date: 2014-11-25 20:54:13
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:00:38

@_date: 2014-10-30 15:42:57
yeah no, im not im just giving my experience of it 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:13:19
if you think it will recover
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:38:31
iv already sold 
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:58:34
i would prefer to cut my losses 
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:58:38
i would prefer to cut my losses 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:22:39
yeah most people seem to just blindly believe in it 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:47:46
i have
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:53:13
i dont think its at its low yet i think it has  a way to go still, but we will see
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:39:10
yeah something else would be better but not practical realy
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:11:27
what the guy below said 
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:20:41
yep 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:15:20
2 of those 3 scenarios are beneficial, i like those odds 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:51:29
bitcoin does not compare well to normal currencies 
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:35:03
if it falls much more im out
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:13:49
also i don't think this is the bottom 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:48:21
i have if i think it will recover i will buy it at its low
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:52:05
ill be back if it think it will recover i will buy at the bottom of this low and i think it has a way to go still
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:14:22
im expecting around 50-75
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:34:29
no good reason just a feeling 
@_date: 2015-09-26 09:59:09
All the top comments here are saying the students either didn't try or were stupid but while some wont have tried there always will be some, they are obviously not stupid and this is a bit of a problem that i have seen while introducing bitcoin to people across a large age range, the older ones often struggled to understand it and some of the younger ones just found it to complicated to be worth there time. Bitcoin is more complicated than money and that is a weakness. If you refuse to accept that then nothing is going to change. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:20:21
well my face hurts from face palming now 
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:23:18
