I like Coinami a lot. I especially like them more after how simple it was to fix the transaction today lol. 
I do agree with you, too many places try to complicate things for new folks and they don’t know better so they just get swindled and used, some still do and have no idea, they think it’s normal for crypto to be such a headache. I’ve met a few members on one of the Facebook groups that I introduced to simple wallets like breadwallet for example, the simplest way for beginners and they were coming from a big centralized company and they were blown away at how simple it is. Sending and receiving should be as simple as banking with an online bank of ATM, if it’s complicated and your confused about sending and receiving funds then your coins are in the wrong wallet. Like I said in my original post, I’m not a seasoned trader by any means but even when I first got into crypto, I understood how to send and receive. Those 2 things are the basics and should not be difficult. I don’t know why these companies are doing this, well I mean I do know why, money and greed but they just ruin it for new people that don’t know better.
Ehh..rant over

Yes your right, it was just a few cents to convert to btc, honestly wasn’t a big deal. After the scare of thinking the transaction vanished I was fine with paying the fee. It ended up being fine, my customer was so confused and was like “just collect it” and I’m like no you don’t understand. In this situation I’m not sure what I would have done, I just started giving a discount for bitcoin and she’s a long time customer so I’d have to have eat the money and provided the product or tell her it’s her fault and risk losing her as a long term customer...I’m just glad all went well.

Update, just got a confirmation! Hell yeah, only need 2 more for paxful. Definitely a learning lesson today.

I hear that coinbase banks on newbies mistakes, well it was 90% of the results that came up when I googled “accidentally sent BCH to a BTC wallet through coinbase”...it was story after story of coinbase saying oh well, nothing you can do. These were all coinbase to coinbase wallets. Just glad I don’t use them and coinami lets it’s users have their own keys. I don’t think coinbase lets you have your own key to recover anything.

Yeah I definitely could see that happening but I gave her the dollar amount but she is brand new to crypto. I should have pointed her to a wallet and paxful to buy coins but I didn’t think she was going to jump in with coinbase. I’m not a fan of coinbase but just me. I prefer p2p decentralized platforms.

Actually never mind! I figured it out in coinami! If anyone ever runs into this problem or wants me to post the solution I can. I haven’t read through the posts so I don’t know if Its repetitive or not and Don’t know if it’ll get buried away here in the comments and I should write a new topic about it? I’m new to reddit so...yeah..I solved the problem. I’m happy to help if y’all need the steps.

Coinbase. I don’t have a clue how it happened. I try not to buy coins from there. I buy mine from paxful. I don’t even know how you buy from there but yeah lol I seen the screen shot and was like DOH! You sent btc cash! Got a little freaked out at first but all is good now.

Crap now thinking back I think I hit high priority instead of default. Default is usually a lot higher. I don’t know why I picked high priority, I was preoccupied and it wasn’t a huge transaction so I didn’t pay much attention and hit send. It’s the block that’s the issue I’m assuming right? I’ve transferred many times before I read about btc getting stuck and used normal delivery as an option, with a much larger transaction and never had it take more than a couple hours.

Gotcha. That makes sense. So if I left it alone I’d eventually get it at some point, just no telling when. That’s ultimately what I wanted to know is that it would confirm in the end or I’d get it back to my Coinami wallet. Learning lesson for sure. No matter how small a transaction, pay attention to the miner fee. Thank you.

I went to add a pic but realized I couldn’t so here is what’s on the Blockchain. I just realized the fee was $.06, I thought it was more.
