hi guys. welcome to volatility. Coinbase and GDAX may have just saved a bunch of people a ton of money by freezing it. the crazy influx caused a huge ARTIFICIAL massive spike. no was buying at 8k. no one. when a million people list at "market price" and a thousand people buy at market price, a few lucky coins sell the spike but then buy orders dry up and very very quickly the market price becomes the highest buy order. trust me, the buy order from bots would be insanely low, like 100$ low, just to potentially cash in like crazy in the event this happens.
a very responsible move, that is after the irresponsible move of telling a few million people at the same time, hey this coin is now super easy for millions more customers! good luck!

sorry. mix up of terms. the "interface" is just the look and feel and the buttons and link and such. ie "user interface"
you mean the whole site and app weren't prepared for the traffic volume.   yeah it very much wasn't.
It's the lack of bandwidth that caused everything to get laggy and non responsive. the interface was fine

The interface wasn't really an issue. to be fair any lead time would have led the same effect, but would have excluded people who only have access to coinbase. (apparently in some countries coinbase is the only option?) this would have effectively made coinbase unfavorable as most of the price spike and trades would have happened already, resulting in less money for coinbase/gdax.
less money is bad for business.
