The average person hitting the age of retirement has something like $17,000 invested. And IIrc that is in fact the *average* not the median. So most people have less than $17,000 saved. (Millionaires/billionaires drag the average up).
So if 4% of all Americans have invested in Bitcoin, that likely means a large chunk of Americans who invest anything at all have invested in Bitcoin. Or perhaps Bitcoin has a sizable population of people who otherwise wouldn't invest, but hope $100 here and $100 there will improve their situation.
It'd be interesting to see real numbers on it instead of just guessing.

What everyone is omitting is that these are the official position of banks (in the US) when it comes to *credit card* payments for crypto currencies. And credit is decidedly not *your* (the consumer's) money and it's not an issue of the bank denying you your legal use of your money. You're more than capable of using types of transfers that guarantee funds. 
I've had no issue with ACH or wire transfers between Wells Fargo and Gemini, Kraken, or Coinbase. There are no fees with ACH which covers amounts up to $2500 and wire transfers only cost $30 (with Wells Fargo anyways).
Also if you're trying to stick it to the banks and the system they're in, then CCs are the worst way to do it. They get a % of every purchase no matter what, and if you don't pay it off on the due date then you'll incur a massive amount of interest which goes to the banks. By using ACH you deny the banks both of those types of fees.

The basic steps to turn it into cash:
1. Load the paper wallet into a digital wallet (there are apps on phones, desktop, etc)
2. Find an exchange that you think is solid (preferably based in your own country)
3. Transfer the funds from the digital wallet you made in step 1 to the exchange
4. Sell the BTC on the exchange for fiat
5. Link the exchange with a bank account. Depending on the exchange they will also have "KYC" (Know Your Customer) requirements that will have you upload documents like your driver's license and a picture of yourself.
6. Once the bank account is linked and you've satisfied any KYC requirements, you can send the fiat money to your bank account
Even if your tried to spend the BTC (which you could do after step 1) you have the same problem as most gift cards: There's some small amount left and spending it may be difficult.
If you were enticed by the tip and wanted to buy more BTC, you'd basically end up doing steps 2-6 in reverse.

I am a landlord and I know I wouldn't take bonds as payment. Also it's not really much of a secret, because property management isn't some crazy mystery that no one understands.
If I need to pay for repairs, taxes, or the mortgage payment, I can't give the bank, government, or vendors bonds as payment. They take cash. So having a financial instrument that I can't liquidate is pretty fucking useless.

Are you referring to a coin that does "airdrops" or some other such nonsense? The problem with the "produced value" in such a system is that it depends on the valuation of the system it's in.
If a stock pays out a dividend, I get $$. If someone pays me rent, I get $$. If shitcoin ABC does an airdrop, I just get more ABC, along with every other idiot who bought into the system. And since the whale(s) and organizers can see how everyone is behaving, they know how to move including with airdrops. If ABC has 1,000,000 coins and they airdrop 500,000 you can be sure the price of ABC will plummet as people trade away this "produced value" to BTC. But if you want to "earn" more ABC you have to hold on to it for the next airdrop, so you sit there holding the bag (as you said, a Ponzi scheme)
So maybe these airdrops over the months/year doubled your holdings of ABC but meanwhile its valuation dropped 80%. So if you paid $1000 originally, you now have $400. Just because someone hands you a million Funny Bucks doesn't mean they produced value.
To be clear, I support BTC and am hoping it replaces currencies like USD. I just don't feel like telling people BTC is an investment. I see it as a gamble. It's had a great first decade. Whether it'll have another great decade is still to be seen. 
The average person of retirement age in the US has $17,000 saved. That's the average, not the median. In this case the average is skewed upwards by those who save and the median would be lower. I'm not about to tell friends and family to spend $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 etc on BTC as if it's a sure thing when no one can possibly know what will happen down the road. At least with mutual/index funds they're protected as well as they can be. I sure as shit wouldn't offer BTC as an option to someone asking for something on the scale of 30+ years because it doesn't even have that much historical data.
To the people who can afford to lose money: buy BTC. The average person in my sphere of influence in the USA would be far better served with the simple act of developing a 3-6 months worth of expenses emergency fund, and they're not in a position to drop $1000 on something like BTC unless they fully understand the risks. 
BTC is my early retirement scheme; it's not my emergency fund scheme or my financial independence scheme or my normal retirement scheme, and I would argue all three of those have a higher priority than BTC/early retirement.

Landlords also don't accept stocks as a form of rent payment. They might take bonds, but that's a really fucking weird way to pay rent.

I would agree that Bitcoin isn't an investment.
People use different definitions for the word "investment" but the one I use is "something that produces value".
Some examples: owning a primary residence is not a (financial) investment; building equity is not produced value. A rental property is an investment. You not only gain equity but someone is paying you (producing value).
Another example: when a stock rises in value, it is ***not*** producing value. The rise and fall of a stock's price is not the part that makes it an investment. When a stock pays out a dividend, then it is an investment because it's producing value.
And under this definition, Bitcoin isn't an investment. There's an argument to be made that forks can almost be seen as an analogue to dividends but it's not consistent enough for me to include it. It's great to have been able to sell off shitcoins like BTC gold and diamond and end up with more BTC than I had before, but there's no guarantee that such forks will happen or that we can expect similar circumstances in the future.
Of course, there's differing opinions on what "investment" means but I would personally call BTC a gamble. Just like I would call any stock that doesn't have a history of paying out dividends a gamble.

If you start out with 1 thingamajig, enter a black box, and then come out of that black box with 10,000 thingamajigs that's taxable income. 
It doesn't matter if it's a currency or any other good. It doesn't matter what you did inside the black box. It doesn't even matter if what you did in the black box was illegal.
If you have any sort of serious amount of money in crypto you need to figure this shit out.

Coinbase continues to use bitcoin as it sees fit, and that usage of bitcoin is good for bitcoin.
If you have better ideas then make a company and implement them. The entire point of bitcoin is that you can't control how other people use it. If bitcoin can't survive an "enemy" like coinbase, then it's not really worth much anyways is it...

Total supply \* last known price = market cap.
You could sell a coin at $0.001 and as long as there's 1,000,000,000,000 of that particular coin, then the market cap is $1 trillion. You spend a dollar like that and your market cap is larger than the world's GDP. 
This is a tactic that many scam coins utilize to artificially inflate their market cap. Watching market cap works insofar as using it as a rough estimate of how each coin stacks up. Daily volume, wvap, and other metrics help discern which coins actually have value.

If the person who made it kept 51% of each bill, they would be able to take that portion of it to a bank and get the a new note of equal value.
Then it would cost $0,
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:31:03
I agree with you. And to add to it: Dollar Cost Averaging is magical.
Let's say you had $20,000 to invest. And lets say you invested it last year, in 2017. You split the $20k up into 52 equal payments of $384.61, and purchase BTC every Sunday in 2017. You would end up with 9.44 BTC and will have paid on average $2,119 per bitcoin. 
Now, if you compare it to buying $20,000 of BTC  (price of BTC near the beginning of 2017), you could have had 24.5 BTC and cashed out for hundreds of thousands within the same year. Or you could have bought $20,000  and had 1.165 BTC, and have less than $4,000 now.
The problem with lump sums is that you can't predict the market. Or more accurately: if there are people who CAN predict the market, they won't be telling you because they want to make money and they don't want to share it with millions of random internet strangers. 
Dollar Cost Averaging, people. If you have a lump sum to invest, then put it in a neutral position (most exchanges allow this) and buy every week, every two weeks, every month, etc. Whether that's $10, $20, $50, $100, $500...whatever is affordable to you. Bitcoin is still a gamble, so don't use money you can't afford to lose...but with dollar cost averaging you can stomach these drops a bit better.

* BTC is a panacea for your financial ills. Be your own bank!
* Spread the word; destroy the institutions!
* Don't let anyone know you have any BTC. It's too dangerous and your BTC will be stolen.

For US customers: gemini.com, coinbase.com, and kraken.com
I only specify US because these are based in the US; for what little benefit legislation may have, you should have an account on an exchange in your home country. If you're, say, American and your exchange is in Morocco, then you'll be SoL if things go bad.

No, they're trying to advertise to average people that they're regulated.
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:17:51
Regulated by laws, and they're headquartered in New York state so they're regulated by New York, the United States federal government, and potentially any relevant state-by-state regulations in the states they conduct business.
Someone else in the comments mentioned they may be trying to get up and going in Europe, so they're potentially going to be regulated there as well.

If you're in the US, three options are [Kraken]( [Gemini]( and [Coinbase](
If you're in a different country, I recommend finding an exchange that operates within your own country. The goal is that you'll have some sort of legal standing if the exchange decides to steal your money (not to be confused with stealing your bitcoin, for which there's not much any country can do; not your keys, not your coin). 
For example, if you transfer $200 from your bank to the exchange, and the exchange just takes the $200 and never credits your account, you want to be able to sue or otherwise claim those funds back. If the exchange is in a different country....good luck getting it back.

I get what you're saying but it's easily verifiable. All OP has to do is send some small amount, like 1000 Satoshis from their address.
"Unverified" would be appropriate. But verification/authentication is one thing cryptography is built for.
