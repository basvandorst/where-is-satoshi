That's awesome and I'm really glad I could help out!

I'm going to have to disagree.  Right now to get a bitcoin following all the rules as an American I would first have to link my bank account using coinbase, this will take time.  Then I have to place an order for the bitcoin through coinbase, this will take time, and finally I can put it into a secure wallet.  This may sound easy, but most teenagers don't have easy access to a bank account, and more than likely a parent won't feel comfortable with this.  This leaves the only other option using the paypal/virwok method which not only takes a long time, but is also extremely expensive.  I am pretty confident that when someone creates an easy and safe way to get coins quickly bitcoin will jump up higher than it is now.

I didn't mean the wallets themselves. I completely agree that most wallets these days are extremely safe and easy to use, and most people can use them. I was referring to changing fiat into btc.

Thanks for posting this tf2manu.  For those of whom who don't know I am the OP from that giveaway thread.  I am 15 years old, and feel very passionately about bitcoin.  I find it very unfortunate that bitcoin is not catching on in my age group.  The reason for the lack of adoption is partly due to that none of these kids have been exposed to bitcoin in any way yet.  I want to change this.  Over the past couple weeks I have been trying very hard to expose my friends, peers, and now to bitcoin.  I started off with this presentation I gave to my class:      Then I started handing out paper wallets around my school:  and most recently the giveaway in I went into the giveaway with the intention of getting 1 kid involved in bitcoin.  If even a single kid got involved I would consider it a success.  From the massive ammount of messages, and people telling me how they are now considering buying BTC, and mining makes me think this thread was a success.  Worst case scenario a hundred teenagers now know what bitcon is, best case a couple actually got involved.
I really hope to do more threads like this in the future, in a number of subreddits!

I plan on doing something like this, and also Im not going tell them how much is in the wallet so theu dont just do it to make a quick buck.

I think op didn't grab a good screen cap. There were over 600 comments on the post before I went to bed (I just woke up and haven't even checked the thread yet).  Alot of the questions were very similar so at the end I may have slipped slightly 
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:55:29
I'm speechless.  Thank you.  With this I definitely think I'll reach my goal of getting every single person in the thread!

Thank you, for both the advice and the tip
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:37:12
Poorly.  It is simply because for a young kid it is very hard trade fiat into BTC.  As much as people want to say using coinbase it is easy the average 15 year old doesn't have complete access to a bank account with funds, most of us don't even have jobs. If bitcoin wants to be accepted by every demographic it will have to get easier for young kids to exchange fiat for BTC, and I am hoping that ATMs fix this.
Also a lot of kdis have heard of bitcoin in the news and on social media.  I would probably say a similar amount to the adults that have heard of it (maybe even more), but a tiny fraction of these people have actually invested.

I posted this a couple days ago, but had to remove it due to some difficulties after about 10 minutes.
Unfortunately I did not win the debate, but in the end I still consider me speaking a success because it did teach many of my peers about bitcoin, with some of them actually coming up to me wanting to get involved; I was even able to give away some paper wallets!

I do plan on keeping a portion of the BTC, but right now I do find it important to spread bitcoin to my peers.  The amount of kids that have even heard of bitcoin is remarkably low even with the widespread use of smartphones, and social media.  In my opinion if we want bitcoin to succeed as a currency/commodity, and not just a quick investment we need to get people of all different ages involved.

From tips on reddit I recieved around .3 BTC that I transfered into a wallet.  I used these funds for the wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:45:36
Thanks!  My public speaking teacher probably wouldn't want to hear this, but I didn't prepare a ton.  I just got a basic outline of what I wanted to talk about in my head, and made the power point.  Most other students prepared a written speech, and talked off of that.  Due to my knowledge of bitcoin I felt as though I could just talk using the information I had already absorbed.
I did go over the introduction a lot in my head so I'm glad you liked it :)
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:48:42
I filled each up with .01 BTC, and I have about 6 wallets that I am going to bring to school tomorrow. If it goes well I will definitely bring the rest.  Here is my original post containing the presentation 
Thank you to and everyone else who tipped allowing me to spread BTC to my peers.

Hey thanks for doing all the math on this. These giveaways are not the only ways I have been spreading bitcoin. At school I often carry paper wallets filled with .01 btc that I give to peers that show interest in bitcoin. Also I have been making a plan for almost a "scavenger hunt" around my school with bitcoin that I will make a post about tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 23:08:57
Thanks!  I am involved in the JSA club (kinda like debate).  The hardest part of coming up what I was going to say was trying to keep it simple.  I tried to simply it down as much as possible, but I do think it was still hard for some of them to understand it, but there are definitely couple who fully understood it which was my goal.

I am 15 years old bitcoin enthusiast, and over the past couple weeks one of my main goals has been to spread bitcoin to my peers.  I have done this through a number of presentations in my classes, giveaways on and most importantly giving paper wallets to people my age that show legitmate interest in bitcoin.
Your app has made it remarkably easier to accomplish these goals. Every time I give someone a paper wallet the next sentance to come out of my mouth is almost always, "Next all you have to do into download the blockchain app".
It really saddens me that I can no longer use this tool to help spread bitcoin, but I hope you guys get it back running soon.  Just thought I would thank you for all you guys do for bitcoin since I saw that you guys wrote this post.

Unfortunately I had to quickly skim on the logistics of bitcoin.  The presentation was more about keeping the audience entertained, and I didn't want to bore the class with the specifics of mining, the network, or the specifics of bitcoin.  In the end I think it would have just confused more people, and make their first experience with bitcoin a sour one.
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:47:20

Thanks for the tip!  I wouldn't really consider it charity.  The most I am giving to a single person is $1.50.  It is completely to raise awareness and get people my age involved with bitcoin involved.  I do find this to be successful I've had a couple people message me, and a load of comments about people who are now very interested.  Even if one person begins using bitcoin iit is a success in my book.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:47:31
For kids I think the sky's the limit.  For the not so good kids, a way to anonymously buy there not so good things (I had a kid come up to me after the presentation and ask if you could buy a bowl with BTC).  For the more tech savy kids, a way to buy virtual goods (games, movie, ect) that isn't paypal.  This could also greatly reduce the amount of movies that are pirated as I know a lot of people that pirate movies because they don't have access to a credit to buy them online.  Lastly it can simply be a safer credit card replacement.  For example I went the city this weekend with some friends.  I don't own a credit card, and if a had lost all my cash I don't really know what I would do.  Before I left I loaded a blockchain.info wallet up with some BTC so if someone did go wrong I would at least of something.  It may not be much since not a ton a places accept BTC as payment, but in the future as much begin to accept I think it will be very useful.

Bitcoin was created by a person who goes by the name of Satoshi Nakomoto.  Satoshi released the bitcoin client completely open source, meaning that users can see every single piece of code used in the software.
When users download the bitcoin client or mine for bitcoin they help confirm that any changes, or transaction to the blockcain are legitimate (I would have explained the blockchain before the question period).  51% of users would have to confirm the addition of these bitcoins, which would not happen.
In 2010 Satoshi "dissapeared" and is no longer involved with the bitcoin community, or in the development of the software.  The software is now maintained by members of the community, and this proves that no one can negitivly affect the bitcoin network without the majority of users agreeing to the changes.

Yup that is me.  I have a seperate wallet for bitcointalk tips.  From reddit I got about .3 BTC.  So far I have only touched these funds for the paper wallets, and haven't even touched the funds from bitcointalk.com (.032).
A.  The QR code in the video isn't an address I am in control of.  It was an address that I made for my friend to show the class that they cannot identify someone just from the public key.
B. I am assuming you are talking about PGP, which to be completely honest I don't know much about.  I am going to change the video description to "Hi reddit" durring my lunch period (10:36pm)
C.  To get the funds onto the wallets I first move some funds from my bitcoinQT client to a blockchain.info online wallet.  From here I sent them to each individual wallet.  For the sake of my peers anonymity is there any way I can prove it without giving an address?  If there isn't I'm not 100% comfortable putting my friend's address online.

I have been doing a few things to do this including giving presentations to my class on bitcoin, handing out paper wallets, and obviously these giveaways.  My goals for these giveaways are to get even one or two people involved in bitcoin and so far I think I've been decently successful!

I'm going to take this as a preparation question :)
The silkroad was an illicit marketplace in which the main payment method was bitcoin.  It has been estimated that at it's prime a little less than 1% of all bitcoin transactions were facilitated through the silkroad, and that number is now way lower after two busts.  The price of bitcoin has grown significantly since the major bust, proving that bitcoin wasn't relying on the silkroad.  Dead Pirate Roberts was the creator of the Silk Road, and he was in fact arrested.  He also recently pleaded not guilty of the charges he was accused of.

Probably similar to how it is over there.  Right now the biggest limiter is how hard it is to get bitcoin.  Until places like paypal start to allow bitcoin, or someone makes an exchange that allows credit cards, bitcoin will never grow at least in the younger community.  Right now it is simply too hard for any younger kid to get into bitcoin.  Due to this I think the adoption is very slow.  I have a couple friends who owns small amounts (.02ish), and the rest that are interested don't have much.  I am hoping that these paper wallets spark their curiosity though.
