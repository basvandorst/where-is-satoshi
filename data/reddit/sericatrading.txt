Congratulations to the Counterparty Core Dev Team on raising such a massive round. 
Another critical application of bitcoin blockchain technology for real-world, and urgent financial services problems that need solving today, gets the appropriate investor support.

Not much of a market for cars right now. Most assets are either precious assets or commodities.

That was too easy a miss. We'll add that and check with BitPay on making that list comprehensive. Thank you!

How does it work: We have brokers and dealers of hard assets that are seeking new markets. All brokers and partners are registered and regulated in their appropriate jurisdictions. Customers pay with bitcoins and receive their tokens on the blockchain. Serica acts as custodian of the asset rights. Customers can then trade their tokens for bitcoins. Customers may also redeem their tokens for the assets themselves or the asset rights held in custody. We should really have this in a nice flowchart so great question for us to add some content to show the above in easy steps. Thanks for the query!

Thanks for the shared perspective. Good thoughts here that we can incorporate and yes: We can talk more about the issue of intrinsic value of Bitcoin.

Thanks. This is very helpful. We could cut down on the inner workings, but we're trying to educate folks who are very skeptical.  Your points are direct. Will snarf what I can from your notes above.
