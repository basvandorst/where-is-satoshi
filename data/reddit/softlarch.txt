Sorry, man, I can feel you. I personally don't use stop-loss orders anymore. This market is too volatile and sometimes stop-loss orders just get exploited. So ironically, stop loss orders in crypto often don't prevent you from losses, but from gains. Many rules valid for stock trading don't work in crypto.

Ok, indirectly maybe. "Satoshi/USD high =&gt; fee high". But fees (satoshi) are primary high because of a full mempool creating sort of a 'fee-battle' for the next block. And theoretically, the mempool can get full even at low prices, depending on the amount of transactions.

I don't think it is under attack. Many banks/governments are still in the state of evaluation. Their main concern atm is crypto as an instrument for money laundering and tax evasion. So in 2018 we will see more regulations for fiat-crypto gateways (exchanges and the like) to prevent anonymity. I don't think, crypto is seen as a real thread right now, but this may change with growing adoption.

Whats up with that "under attack"? High fees and a slow network is a direct result of bitcoins recent insane rise and a result of its adoption in public / hype in media.
There is no need of an attack. It is a problem with bitcoin cores tech (and needs a quick solution). It is an built-in attack, if you like. The "attack" is bitcoin core's high price leading to high on chain action.

There once was a philosopher named David Hume, thinking about the [Problem of induction]( Basically it says: The observation of the sun rising is no proof for the event that the sun will rise again. Sounds crazy and depends on the meaning of the term "proof". The main point is: Each and every day it rises, you just add a new observation.
Btw, to say "The sun may rise in the west and set in the east" is of a very different category than saying "The observation of the sun always rising in the east is not a proof for it will rise there again." 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:36
You believe, but you don't know. You believe in a coin with high fees and a slow network, in a coin that doesn't scale properly with its current demand, a coin that simply can't handle its current market position. And these problems are inherently in that coin, they are self-contained. They don't result from people acting badly, not from pumps or dumps, not because someone is stealing names. You may not like those behaviors of people, okay, but they are not the reason for the problems of Bitcoin Core. Those people maybe are just pointing very clearly at them. That doesn't make them causal responsible.
This is nothing that couldn't be changed. There are solutions. Bitcoin Core is not yet doomed. Thing is, there are solutions that already exist. Many of them, actually, not only this unpopular coin I won't name here.
Why do you talk about an "army of fools supporting unpopular coins", when they maybe are just an army of smart, rational acting people, that don't believe, but just maximize. Maximize on utility, usefulness and price.
So hodl this coin at its current state at your own risk. The moon may be nearer for other coins at the moment. Maybe even mid to long term.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:00:55

I am not an crypto expert, but I think there are other coins that would scale well even at the market position BTC is right now. ETH maybe an example. What you basically say: crypto is generally useless, because every coin suffers from high fees and slow network, when the demand is high. I do not agree here. I think, it is just a matter of the scalability of the coin.
You may ignore me, but my statements still exist. Think about them. Maybe, in the end you will know, not just believe.

From the viewpoint of a seller:
**Rising:** Price is 100. Sellers get greedy and increase the price above 100. If there are buyers that accept this price increase, the price will rise above 100, maybe to 101.
Price is now 101. Sellers still greedy and increase the price to 102 ...
**Falling:** Price is 100. Sellers increase the price slowly above 100. No one wants to buy!
So sellers decrease the price below 100. Buyers found, maybe for 99.
Price is now 99. No further buyers, so sellers decrease the price more ...
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:33:11
You are correct, it is not an appeal to tradition, I made a mistake here.
Basically, the argument goes like:
This time is different, because never before the mempool was that full and the fees were that high. People can't move their coins or - if they do - will lose money. And because this time the situation is very different from a situation, where on a dip everything was fine with the coin, you can't predict what will happen this time.

I as well think the SEC is collaborating. Exactly at the time the bad ETF bad news came out, price was manipulated down. I don't think this was a "natural" panic sell off. This was a planned trading bot action. Yes, maybe right now people are selling low, but not those that dumped the price at first.
Whales that have the financial power to move the price down are people that knew the bad ETF before. They know that there will be no ETF, maybe never, maybe not before the price is back to $2k, who knows.

Personally, I don't think you can get a millionaire anymore with BTC, if you don't invest the half of a shitload of money already as a starting point.

Maybe, but that includes the risk of not selling any coin at all, if the limit is too high, leaving you as an unhappy bagholder, should the coin never recover from its dip.

It is perfectly normal for a simple stop loss to *not* sell at the set price, but lower. Especially in a flash crash. A stop loss just creates a market order, when the set price is reached. At the time of the execution of this *new* market order, price may be lower.
You can set a stop-limit order at Bitfinex, though, but this will still not protect you fully from losses in a case of high volatility. Even worse: May happen you don't sell any coin at all.

Ok, software problems may occur. But this situation exists for months now and nothing seems to get better. I am working in software business. If we wouldn't fix that sort of shit within a quarter, we would get serious legal problems with our customers (many of them signed maintenance contracts). Thats the bad side of unregulated crypto markets: Deposit and just hope for a nice service.

Some money (well, a bit more than usual) went from alts to bitcoin in expectation of "free" S2X coin. This airdrop will not happen, so that money moves back from bitcoin to alts. That's all. 
Maybe BTC will pull back to 7000, but that's just a rest before a new rise. Fork not happening is a positive signal for conventional investors, fear and uncertainty has gone.

15% fees buying bitcoin? Wow, can't be, where are you from (I pay about 1%).
Yes, basically, it is buying low and selling high. Sounds easier as it is. Often we forget to sell (take profits) when a coin is really high, because we think it still will go higher, just to watch its inevitable drop.
And buying low doesn't mean to buy high in the expectation a coin will go higher. Try to buy low when a coin is *falling* (or short after a drop) and you expect it to rise again later (= buying the dip).
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:10:38
That is a great idea and it would optimize your gains.

If one single trader buys (alot) BTC with EUR at Kraken only, its normal to see that happen, I think. Trading bots usually correct those situations quickly.
There aren't many good alternatives to buy BTC for (alot) EUR, so thats maybe the reason for high volume, despite the shitty exchange.

Disagree. I think big institutional whales know even more than the average joe. Those who can control the market even *understand* what is going on. It is just the other way around: You and me and most of *us* don't know. We just have to sit and watch. 
The market didn't "crash" recently because of fear, but because of deliberate whale action. We all don't know the true reasons for this selloff. Could have been just closing futures. Could have been someone needing liquidity in USD for price action during the upcoming BCH hash war.

For the "buy the dip" advice to be valid, there has to be a dip, not a correction. There were no dips at 14k and 12k. These were marks of a downward correction, so I can understand you. 
I know this will get downvotes. But folks, there is a moment, when it gets ridiculous to talk about dips. Of course it is unpleasant. Of course BTC may recover, but this will take a *really* long time now, depending on when you got in.

Banks always try to look like that. "Hey! We can offer you a nice credit, so you can have a nice holiday, own house and freedom." - And strangely enough, I am a former customer of the Citibank (but left them some years ago)
Saying "feel free", "you are not being forced to" is factually right. But practically it is not that easy to switch your main bank. That is not a matter of a few days, it is not a weekend decision. So there are forces at work that prevent daily bank hopping - and they know that. Yes, in some sense, we are forced to.

Some person or group bought a large amount of some coins, not only Bitcoin. That is the reason.

Crypto doesn't need news, especially not for huge dips. It is a Game of Whales, you know? Often there is a dip, then people searching for reasons, then the news. In that order.
Some whale just needs the price down, maybe to profit more from the shorts he opened. So he sells a few millions worth of BTC to gain even more millions of $$$ by closing his shorts later.
If you don't have the funds to play the big game, you have to try to surf the waves created by the whales. And ignore the news, most of them are irrelevant or fake anyway.

I answer this questions with "no", so for me, it is a weak argument salted with FUD.
Secondary argument is: "If something doesn't produce value and its value is high, is it a bubble?", but this question does not depend on Warren Buffet.
