It seems that based on the comments on the Winklevoss ETF, that cold storage would be permitted, so long as they can demonstrate proof of control via a signed message on a regular basis for all accounts.  But this is an ETF, where exchange between bitcoin and dollars would be rare and only large entities can arbitrage it.  It seems it's probably safer to trade with Winklevoss ETF than actual bitcoin on an exchange.

Every account is a row in a database.  Every transaction updates the balances of the buyer and seller (and subtracts a tiny amount of fees for the exchange), and writes it to a transaction log.  The amount of the two currencies held by the exchange doesn't change and it's not written to the blockchain.
When you withdrawl, the decrements the record with your balance and sends you a transaction on chain.
When you deposit, they give you an address, watch it for deposits, and after a number of confirmations add it to your balance record.

I would think this would qualify for a deduction but no necessarily capital loss.  It's more akin to physically losing cash money, or a fire loss.  You might want to look into that.
I would advise that if you're just calling it a loss to avoid paying taxes, that it would be considered tax fraud if you ever move the coins again, unless you pay the tax on the "found" coins.

The scale doesn't matter.  It's $11.38 per day REVENUE per unit which until breakeven isn't profit.  I considered the repayment cost with FREE power and came up with 160 days.  CHEAP power is more expensive than free power, so it HAS to take more than 160 days.  This is the same whether there's 1 or a million units.  However, every time the difficulty goes up, the breakeven time gets longer, and in practice that 160 day repayment never happens.

Lifestyle audit.  If your spending exceeds your means by a significant amount, you're at risk for an audit.


Sure, so long as you file the capital gains [as required by the IRS](
Owning a bank account with dollars is not the same according to the IRS.  Whether you think it should be or not is irrelevant.  It simply isn't right now.  It's not the same if you hold Euros, Yen, or shares of a company either, that's just the way it is.
Also, $16 million showing up in your bank account is going to trigger AML, for which the bank will directly report the transaction.  The IRS recently has been gaining access to foreign banks as well so even if you do the transaction using foreign currency to skirt the regulations you could get caught.  Your exchange might report the transaction depending which you use.  Let's face it, you're not using localbitcoins to convert $16 million worth of bitcoin into cash.

I thought you misspelled IRS.  I have no idea what IRC is in this context.  [Neither does google](


I don't know what the IRC is.


The tax software I used had an option for this.  I've done it for the past two years.


If someone wins $25MM in the lottery they have to pay tax on it.  And as a deposit over $10,000 it will be reported when deposited in your account and you'll have to report it on your tax return.  As long as you report it, everything matches up and you'll be fine.


I don't really care whether you think I know what I'm talking about or not.  Since every source I've seen states you need to pay capital gains tax on bitcoin and not a single one says the opposite, I'm not sure how you could possibly have come to that conclusion.




Ok, yeah these actually suck, but I don't see how this brings you to the conclusion that the correct answer is to not pay any tax at all.

I'd consider it to count as yours when you "take delivery" of the coins, by splitting them, or an exchange credits them to your account.  Ex. Coinbase hasn't delivered BCH or BTG yet, if they fail to do so by end of year you really haven't been delivered the coins, and pay the tax instead in whatever year you do take delivery.  You're ultimately going to be paying the same tax, at a cost basis of zero.

I hate to tell you this, because I think you have a clever idea, but "to make a billion dollars" isn't a missions statement.
It seems to me that you want to build essentially a contract company, and contract out every level of business to arbitrary people.  But then, someone has to validate that work, and that's either got to be you, or someone you contract in exchange for JellCoin.  Unlike BitCoin, proof of work for human jobs is often subjective.  I can advertise something and prove to you I've done it, but perhaps I advertised a baseball team by talking about it to people in Japan who've never heard about or care about baseball, or advertised for your college book company in an old folks home.  That doesn't help you, but I can still prove I've done it.  What I'm saying is, I don't know how you can guarantee quality, so the work while proven may just suck.  On the other hand, if the job is say for $1million dollars worth of coin, I as a contractor could get completely screwed if someone gets it done slightly quicker and takes the payout when doing a worse job and I get nothing.  This lowers the incentive for highly skilled people to contribute for high-value tasks.
Secondly, how will you validate JellCoin transactions?  You still have to maintain a blockchain, and that still needs to be validated electronically, so you'll still need the equivalent of miners.  That's not a problem, but you explicitly said that people will mine the blocks.  There's no way for humans to keep the books on an entire currency system if you plan on being successful.

I thought about that one, and....yes I would, assuming the person lives in the same country.  Even more so if I'm asking for money from another person who doesn't already have bitcoin.
Mailing a check may be old fashioned, but the "transaction fee" is 55 cents for the check itself, envelope, and stamp.  I have access to free envelopes at work, can buy stamps while I'm at the store, and can mail a letter by dropping it in the outbound mail bin 30 feet from my desk, so there aren't any hidden costs except the two minutes to prepare it.
The minimum transaction fee for bitcoin will by 45 cents as of right now, so unless I can get the BTC faster or for cheaper than 10 cents total, the check is better.  I can either buy the BTC with coinbase and wait a week to receive them (slower than mail) at 1% cost (more expensive than mail), or find a stranger online and arrange for a shady meeting to buy bitcoins (riskier, more time consuming than mail).
I already have a coinbase level 2 account set up with the ability to instantly buy $1000 per week, *BUT* I don't know a single other person in real life with a level 2 account....and one person who *might* have a level 1 account.

I'd love to see it hit $100000, because that means no more mortgage, but at some point due to math it has to stop.  I think it's going to slow down.  I suspect it will bounce between $500 and $1000 for a while before hitting $2000ish by 2015.  $1000 is a point where I believe many investors will consider it wise to sell which will case a drop and the next cycle to start.  Once everyone gets used to $1000 BTC and yet more stores start to accept it, the price will rise more but slowly.

The value doesn't come from mining, mining *lowers* the value by adding more supply.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:34:15
People holding bitcoin effectively reduce the supply of tradable bitcoin, thereby the value of bitcoin can be inflated beyond that of it's transactional value.
Extreme example: If I hold 10 million bitcoins that I refuse to sell, and assuming there's 2 million lost forever, and the market cap is $20 billion, then the supply of bitcoin is only 374000, making each worth roughly $50000.  If I dump my supply back into the market, then the price drops drastically.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:52:07
It's not a matter of block time.  Miners don't have to include any particular transaction from the transaction pool in the block, ever.  There is little incentive to include transactions with no fee, so very few miners will bother trying to include it in a block, which means that you will have to wait until some miner includes it out of the kindness of their heart which could take a very long time.

The reason I think it's less than M2 is because M2 includes fractional reserve banking.  If bitcoin becomes the global currency, it will have fractional reserve banking as well.

Yeah, in order for bitcoin to succeed we need to work WITH the government, not against it.  I feel this community often has a double-barrel shotgun pointed at it's own feet, because of people's uncompromising pie-in-the-sky ideals.
To succeed, we need a foothold, and we're getting it, but with that comes regulation and taxation, and other difficulties.  The government wants these things to succeed because they can get money from it, but if all we do is evade regulation, set up black markets, and pretend we'll be relevant when outlawed by the government we're walking into our own execution.
We won't destroy banks, because people will still need loans/mortgages, secured/insured deposit accounts, and insurance which will be provided by 'banks' whether they're the banks we have now or new ones that are created by bitcoin entrepreneurs.  Maybe it will lessen their control, but it won't abolish them.
Dreaming is good, but we need to look at what bitcoin is, and where we can move forward from there, first by establishing a foothold in the economy, and developing products and services that are based on bitcoin.

They clever bit of this approach is that 100% of it can be held offline in cold storage.
That means, there's only two sources of risk:
1. Physical Security
2. Generation of the actual keys
Which puts it in a much better situation than the exchanges which cannot hold 100% of their assets in cold storage, must be Internet accessible and routinely move coins out of cold storage resulting in many sources of risk.

Generally speaking, how large of an operation would be considered a business vs a hobby?  I currently have ~$8000 worth of scrypt miners.  I intend to be profitable, but won't for several months yet.

I disagree.  Any company that wants to succeed must be willing to change with the times.  The value of eBay can only go up by accepting additional forms of payment, especially with the additional profit of selling mining equipment and miners paying for it in bitcoin.  The value of PayPal won't go away, at least not quickly.  Many people don't know about bitcoin, don't have bitcoin, or don't know how to get or spend bitcoin and will continue using PayPal.
The only thing that will come from shunning bitcoin is that someone will create an alternative that does and take some of their business.

The difference is that voting takes a few minutes one day a year, while running a full node takes up a ton of space, bandwidth, and processing power.  As users move from traditional desktops to battery powered devices such as laptops, tablets and phones, it's just not possible.  I can't possibly run a full node on my tablet.  It doesn't have enough space, nor enough processing power if bitcoin hits mainstream use.  Running it on a laptop would kill your battery and make it run hot all the time.
Few people still have desktop machines...they would have to go buy one again, just to run a bitcoin node, or rent a server to run one on.  That's...unlikely.

However, the bit about mining shouldn't really be there.  Bitcoin mining is no longer possible using GPUs.

Doubtful in that timeframe.  I'm pretty optimistic, but not that much.  If the entire world's M0 money supply of around $6 trillion USD where converted to bitcoin, each of the 15 million bitcoins would be worth 1 / 15 millionth of the total supply, so each one would be worth $400,000 .  You'd still have to account for the permanently lost coins, but assuming half are lost, you'd basically need the entire world to be using nothing but bitcoin to reach a value of $1MM / coin.  And of course, new bitcoins are still being mined.

When hardware costs + power &gt; block rewards.
Big miners will be hit the hardest, but will also probably take longer to get hit, since they have the best hardware.  Once they start losing money, they will lose *BIG*, because they're losing the same amount times hundreds and hundreds of machines, so if there's nothing to upgrade to, they will power down their gear.  Small miners have relatively low cost, which maybe be subsidized by other income, some small miners will continue mining at a loss in hopes the price on their mined coins goes up.
There's no way to put a specific number on it, because it will vary across all miners based on power costs and what gear they have.

I think everyone is hesitant to buy in right now due to the Gox situation.  I suspect that it will continue to slip until Gox is fully up, at which point:
1. People will buy on Gox due to the low price, lowering buy pressure in other exchanges
2. Mass withdrawal of BTC from Gox into other exchanges where some of it will be sold off, increasing sell pressure
3. Arbitrage, increasing sell pressure on other exchanges.
I suspect the price will go considerably lower than it is now, and that eventually investors will start buying up all the cheap BTC and send the price up again to last year's levels or higher.

The tax obligation using the standard deduction if he cashes out today and isn't employed would be about $400, and he'd may get to keep some of that as a student.  When I worked while in college I made about that much per year and never paid a dime, all legit.  It's not worth risking prison over.
They can certainly prove he received it, and you are required to keep records on it.  The IRS doesn't care if you lost it, it's not court, they'll demand it anyway.  Try telling them you've lost your paycheck and ask for all your money back.  If it's a legitimate loss, it should be reported as a loss on taxes so they can get you for fraud there as well.
If you made the money mining, there's much less chance of you getting caught then winning it in a contest and telling a bunch of jealous redditors.  If you want to risk it, then go for it.  I don't advise it, I'd rather not go to prison, but you're telling a 16 year old to commit a federal crime that could land him in prison with a record for the rest of his life, let alone draw pressure from federal regulators to crack down on bitcoin users, and giving them fuel to do it.

But there's no reason a whole bunch of coins can't succeed, and no reason to oppose that.  Currency trading is a valid investment, just like stocks.  Adding a new stock doesn't hurt existing stocks, we have a whole stock market where people trade all day long.  Investors increase the value of bitcoin and other currencies.

You've hit upon another problem there.  Lost cost transactions, and therefore low fees are important to the future of bitcoin, however, full nodes are also important, and people don't run them since no one solo mines any more so only pool operators run a full node.  We must find a way to compensate full node operators for their resources.

Some people, probably most people, pay back thier debt because it's the right thing to do, but there's tons of scammers who will ruin that for everyone.  Bitcoin doesn't rely on the honor system, it's cryptographically verified by a hundred billion dollars worth of hardware.  You'd need to collect personal information to give out loans so you can enforce the contract with the legal system, and have your own lawyer to go after people in default.

Best case scenario is that every single person in the world uses bitcoin instead of all other currencies.  I personally feel this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future, because governments want control over the money supply, and they can't have it with bitcoin, as well as fears about thefts and wallet security will cause some people to want to hold other investments.
If everyone in the world used bitcoin, it's value would theoretically match the world money supply.  This is hard to define, but based on M2 supply, this would be about $60 trillion.  Assuming that by the time this happens all bitcoins will have been mined (and also ignoring BTC lost forever), that makes each BTC worth almost $3 million.  At that point demand stops because there's no one left to buy anymore and the value stablizes.
In reality, it's unlikely for that to happen soon if ever.
EDIT: dollar amounts are in USD.  Some assumptions where made in the calculations, and I'm not a real economist.

It works the exact same way for any other thing.  If you mine actual gold, it's income.  If you win the lottery it's income.  If you receive stock and options instead of a salary it's income, and the dividends from the stock is income.
Think of it another way: most people mine in a pool.  If you mine in a pool, you're effectively renting your hashpower to the pool owners in exchange for consistent payment.  That's the conclusion I drew before the IRS ruling was announced which seems to be basically how they see it.

If you take a second job and earn an extra $1000 cash on the side and put it in a sock under your bed, you still have to pay tax on it.   Why would bitcoin be different?
Also, getting "bumped into a higher tax bracket" will NOT hurt you.  You pay taxes in tiers.  The "highest" tax bracket would only apply to money over the lower limit.
IE, if you made $36,000 last year, you'd pay:
    10% on the first $8,925 = $892.50 + 
    15% on the second $27,075 = $4061.25
    for a total of $4953.75
Let's say you mined an extra $2000, which would push you into the next bracket.
Now you owe:
    10% on the first $8,925 = $892.50 + 
    15% on the second $27,325 = $4098.75 +
    25% on the third $1750 = $437.50
    for a total of $5428.75
You paid $475 more, but have $1525 more to keep.

These business practices would be illegal here in the US.  It's not optional to follow shareholder vote, or change your mind without another shareholder vote.  I understand that if it's impossible, then it's impossible, and I don't completely fault them for that, but they should have had another vote as soon as they realized the selected pool was impossible.
They're also making no effort to grow, that's a sign of a failing company.  The 1GH/share model doesn't make sense, and is *also* potentially illegal in the US.  Companies have a *legal duty* to profit for their shareholders, and this model will always result in lower share value month over month.

Nobody "deserves" to have children.  It's not a right.  You don't deserve children any more than you deserve a million dollars, a Lamborghini or your own country.  As the available resources go down, the cost of having a child will go up and up.  There's simply no way to put a dollar amount on a point where someone should have children.
Furthermore, if you have "hundreds of thousands of dollars", it's already possible.  There are decent houses in my area for less than $100k that need some work, or ones around or just over $100k that are move-in ready.  If hundreds of thousands of dollars isn't enough for you to have children, then it's your own choice to live somewhere that it isn't possible; your lack of willingness to sacrifice your lifestyle to do it - if you can't sacrifice your lifestyle, you don't deserve children, ever.

If you want bitcoin to be adopted by the masses, then you can't make up arbitrary rules as to what is and is not an acceptable use.
Sure, it's great that you can use bitcoin without needing a bank, but that doesn't mean that someone can't build a bank.  There are banking services that people will want: Secured storage, currency exchange, loans, investment, and trading.  You can't tell people they can't have those things, because it's not "the spirit of bitcoin".  People don't care about the spirit of bitcoin.  They care about those things.  The great thing is...with bitcoin, you don't have to use any of those things.  You *can* be your own bank.  You don't *have* to, but you can.  You can certainly use localbitcoins and trade personally without using a central entity, and keep your BTC in a paper wallet in your own safe.  But most people don't want to have to schedule a shady meeting with a stranger to exchange money.
If you want to ban businesses from being involved in it, frankly I think *you've* missed the point.  What good is a currency that I can only use for the approved use of exchanging goods with my friends?  I can just use dollars!  Andreas Antonopoulos said that bitcoin is the "internet of money".  We're seeing amazing new things that where never possible before: a payment system with low fees that supports transactions of all sizes, a payment system that enables you digital goods &amp; services without having to trust someone with your personal information, or brick &amp; mortar stores as well, a system that enables anyone to send guaranteed money anywhere in the world in seconds (think of the donations to dorian nakamoto, or the Ukrainian revolution), a system where money can literally not be counterfeited.
To me, those are the reason "why bitcoin?"  Bitcoin puts people in control.  Bitcoin enables.


That's not so much "what I want" (I think you'd be incredibly stupid to short bitcoin) as what I realistically expect.  What I'm telling you is....it doesn't hurt bitcoin for this to happen.  You can choose to participate by putting your money in an online service or not to participate by storing it in a paper or hardware wallet, or keep some in both.  The choice is *yours*.

I hadn't owned any bitcoin until the price hit ~$500.  I have no idea if it's going to go up...hopefully not down, and I haven't really make much at this point.  The advantages I see are 1) trustless system for making online payments.  I don't have to give someone my credit card info for a $5 digital good or service.  I can pay with BTC and risk only what I'm spending.  2) low-fee payments 3) easily send money around the world, to anyone. 4) I can completely control my own money.
The fact is...existing money is outdated.  It's okay for the pre-computer age, but in our modern society it needs a lot of help to work.  Credit Cards &amp; having to give strangers your personal information to spend your money, bank transfers, payment processors, paypal, are all necessary workarounds for the outdated paper money.  Bitcoin or something like it is the future of currency.  If I manage to make money on it, all the better.

All financial institutions do this.  Do you think that any exchange keeps each customer's assets in different wallets?  There's no reason *to* do that, it would just increase risk as all wallets would have to be kept hot.  By pooling, they can dump some bitcoin into cold storage so that it can't be stolen.
For banks, it also means they can loan out the money, which is what enables you to have interest in your deposit accounts.  For bitcoin, it will eventually mean shorting because that will allow the exchange an additional revenue stream (and the currency isn't stable enough for loans right now).  As long as it's managed properly with margin accounts, your money is safe.  Whenever you want to withdrawal, they can call in the shorts if they don't have the btc on hand.  Margin maintenance amounts will require the investor to back a significant portion of the short, and fees will eat them alive if they try to short for a very long time for even more profit for the exchange. For complete safety, they could require 100% of it to be backed, and call in the short the instant it reaches the amount of cash the investor has on hand.
There's no reason to oppose well-managed shorting.

The responses I get are usually:
1.  It's fake money.  People generally don't understand it; I've gotten better at explaining the technical aspects simply, but some people just refuse to believe it isn't a scam.
2.  What do you *do* with it?  In theory, you can do many things.  In reality, there's no stores within 50 miles of here that accept it, in-person transactions are cheaper in dollars, and online purchases typically need your shipping info anyway, so most people use credit card.  Credit Cards are also less risky for a consumer, since they can reverse the transactions.  Many people would rather pay the extra cost than risk accidentally sending their life savings into neverneverland because they miskeyed an address.
3.  It's too complicated.  Unfortunately right now in the US, it is a little complicated, with coinbase being the easiest.  However, even when coinbase was giving away a free ~20000ubits to college students I couldn't convince any college students to sign up - college students who typically jump at the opportunity for free anything couldn't even be bothered to spend five minutes getting free money.

The evidence that I have access to seems to indicate that.  Why did he hide it from his company if he thought it was legit?  Why did he tell people how to avoid AML checks if he thought it was legit?  You have to admit that as the executive of a financial company, it's at a minimum a conflict of interest.
Plus, do you *really* think that by advertising on SR, he didn't think those bitcoins would be used for drugs?  It's obvious that it was, all they need to do is find a specific case he knew about it and did nothing.


It shouldn't be.  But it *is* according to law.  And additionally, if you happen to find out that they're laundering money, you have to report it, by law, as a financial institution.  Whether or not you agree that's how it should work (and I don't), that's what the law is right now.


I'm not telling you my version, I'm telling you how it works by law.  If you want governments and industry to take bitcoin seriously as a legitimate currency, then it needs to be something more than facilitate an illegal black market.  We can *NOT* rally behind someone suspected of and probably will be guilty of money laundering - all this does is backup the assumption that bitcoin is for illegal activity.  If you do, the government could criminalize it altogether, and then you can completely forget about *any* of that innovation and progress.

The original inventor appears not to have spent much if any of his profits.  Check all the output addresses of the low height blocks that would have been mined by Satoshi - they still have coins.  We have no evidence that he's made a dime in fiat.  If it's a Ponzi made by Satoshi, he *really* sucks at it.


Many people on here are holding BTC rather than converting to fiat or spending, including myself (haven't sold even 1 satoshi).  So many that we often have people begging us to spend (which lowers the value).  Businesses don't hold it because: 1) they can't pay *their* bills in bitcoin, and 2) they understandably don't want to add unnecessary risk to their businesses.  There are also 4000 businesses that accept bitcoin.

1.  I agree to an extent...but the HTTP method is selected by the server, not the client
* Clients can't simply change the method, because the server might not respond the same way to the other method.
* Clients could ignore the query string of the URL when adding it to the history, but then there's no guarantee it points to the same resource
* Anyone walking past the user can see the password if it's sent using GET.
Sure, you can say that it's the clients responsibility to secure their machine, but I think that it's a developer's responsibility to follow best practices when possible and secure every aspect of the system they can.
2.  There's a myriad of reasons why this is bad:
* Logs aren't secured as well as a database.
* It increases the attack vector - The attacker now has two chances to get the data:  One on the web server, one in the database.
* Having the list of client credentials provides continual access even after the hole allowing access is fixed.  Access to the database provides a one-time snapshot of data, and no access to services, and you can't even use the hashes to log in.
* It allows access to a user's other services using the same credentials.

The acceptance is weak.  For a contract to be binding, there must be evidence of an acceptance from both sides.  Typically, this is done by exchanging goods, money, or services.  If I decided to give you a bicycle, and we agree, and I give it to you, there's no demonstrable acceptance from you, because you gave me nothing.  For this reason, any time I want, I can demand that bicycle back, because there's no legal acceptance from your side, and the bicycle is technically mine.  If on the contrary, you pay me a dollar for that bicycle, then it is legally your bicycle, and I cannot demand it back from you.  (sidenote: for this reason, if anyone gives you something for free that's worth something, always give them something in return to take legal ownership, even if it's just a dollar)

The re-targeting algorithm adjusts the difficulty so that with the entire network's hash power, a block will be solved in an average time of 10 minutes.
It will eventually be unproductive to mine.  There are no more great technological leaps in hashpower, the current tech (ASICS) is the end of the road - other than parallelism, there's no way to improve any more.  Eventually, if the value of bitcoin increases slower than the cost of hardware, it will reach equilibrium, and mining will not be profitable.  Depending what hardware you use &amp; how fast the vendor ships to you this has already happened.  At the point that mining is unprofitable, some miners will stop mining, and others will continue mining at a loss if they expect the value of BTC to rise more in the future.

It's pretty much completely unprofitable.  I'm not sure which ASICs are the 'best', but I think Antminer was relatively well respected by the mining community, so for the sake of argument let's assume you decide to buy the new [S4](  1400W for $1250.
That system would take [170 days]( to pay for itself assuming difficulty doesn't change (wrong), price doesn't fluctuate (wrong), and power is 10 cents / kW (low for many people).  In reality, that system will NEVER pay for itself, and to top it off, you can't even sell the miner because it doesn't do anything else.
Also, you probably wouldn't run a full node while pool mining as it would add some congestion to your probably terrible upload speed and increase stales.

There where 3 deposit accounts I did not disclose, although in my case, it's just because I didn't want to use the money in them, not because I wanted to hide anything.  Presumably if you transferred a huge sum of money to or from it they will ask for account history on that account to prove you own it.
They always want to know all credit accounts.  If you have any loans they want to know about it and they will find it out when they pull your credit report.

2.  People have a right to be outraged about things they don't like, even if those actions are legal.  Since the premise of Apple devices is "creativity and innovation", it's certainly stepping on toes to block an innovative product, especially without a reason.  It's also terrible for developers.  You can spend years and $1 million working on an app, only to have Apple reject it with no reason and all your work is wasted and your broke.  
Why anyone still develops for iPhone knowing this is beyond me.  Why anyone still buys them knowing all this is beyond me too.

That's much more reasonable, there's certainly truth to that.  Andreas Antonopoulos calls bitcoin an "experiment" and details some problems with it so there's certainly room for improvements.
There arguably have been some currencies better than bitcoin in some ways.  Litecoin has a confirmation time 4 times faster and more fair for miners.  will be quick to point out that they have higher transaction volumes and a confirmation time 1/10th that of bitcoin.  Primecoin helps research.  Vertcoin is even more fair to miners.  Yet none of these have really knocked bitcoin off the top of the food chain, and the coin developers can fix any issues with the protocol.  There's a huge advantage of being first to market - it will take a large improvement before something take's bitcoin's crown.

Maybe.  I hope somebody smarter than me is working on that, because I can't figure out how someone would make an anonymous contract for a resource that doesn't currently exist.  Even if it does the equivalent of "garnishing wages" from your address all the loanee needs to do is create a new wallet, and their debt goes away and you can't sue because you don't know who the owner of the address is.  It would have to work through a service who can validate the identity of the loanee, but then they're just functioning as the bank.

No, it creates the *possibility* of a 51% attack, and I believe it's worth the risks, because:
* It significantly lowers the risk of an attack from GHash.IO and creates a strong competitor to it.
* All other pools require some level of trust that the pool manager won't screw you.  They don't even have to 51% attack the pool, they don't need hash power at all.  They can just leave with any money they haven't yet paid whenever they feel like it.
* A pool being compromised, especially one with a mere 1-3% of hash power, is insignificant to the bitcoin being compromised.  Bitcoin is what we are trying to protect.
* Other miners will likely be more willing to switch once variance is lowered due to Petamine joining the pool.

I promise you, the people writing the presentation never talked to the devs.  I worked in a multinational company with about the same number of employees - I just doesn't happen, and even if it did, devs and marketing have completely different understandings of security.  If anyone from the dev teams was involved, it was some overarching manager 3 levels up from anyone who does development work who is probably basing his knowledge off of some spec sheet someone came up with before a prototype was built.  Speaking of which, the devices the *have* are prototypes, because it's not being released for another few months yet.
It's not a lying vs. truth thing.  It's marketing.  It's a high-level "why should you buy our product" persuasive speech.  If it's true, we'll find out through the trial of time and independent reviews.

Personally I think it depends on how much they mined.  If they set each one up for an hour for testing before shipping I think that's perfectly reasonable as in theory you don't want customers paying for a $5000 item to get a broken one and most electronics either fail right away or several years down the road.
Of course, this being BFL, they most certainly mined far longer than that, and should compensate customers accordingly assuming these allegations are true.

iPad mini wasn't a leading move, it was a following move: Android devices of that range existed long before the mini.  There's also a limit to how many sizes of the same product they can reasonably make.  iPad mega?  Probably not.
Low-end is a bad move as well.  One of the things about Apple that even I as a hater can't deny is they have across-the-board quality.  You can definitely get PCs that are better than Macs, but there's no brand I can recommend where you're guaranteed a better product, other than enthusiast manufactures that far exceed Apple's pricing.  Adding lower-quality devices removes this benefit.
I don't deny that I hate Apple, and I'm not a fan of Jobs, but he was a brilliant businessman and marketer.  Their innovativeness was not in *what* they built, but *when* they did it, and the markets they moved to.  They sold MP3 players before the technology was ready, they sold tablets when the market rejected them and convinced everyone they need one anyway, they moved into a saturated phone market, they convinced the entire creative industry they need Apple.  All of that was done by Jobs, and it all worked.

Most likely you'll have to pay capital gains tax on your BTC, based on a gain of whatever the sale price is.  If you wait a year to sell them, it becomes a long-term investment and the tax goes down a bit.
The rules are murky, and you can even probably get away with paying nothing, but if the IRS catches you intentionally evading them you will go to prison.  The key is to convince them you're following the rules, by following them as best you can.  You probably should have an expert do your taxes, many places will even back you in an audit.

Being the first is in itself valuable.  People will pay money to get the first sports car of a series, the first book, or an actual painting versus a replica.  It was *Bitcoin* that brought the technology and all the other crypto devs did was recompile some source code.
Of course, I wouldn't say that they're *worthless*, but certainly they will never touch bitcoin in market acceptance, capitalization, etc.  As long as people accept them they'll be worth money, but that's the only reason.  Bitcoin is valuable intrinsically because of it's technology and novelty.
Some alts *do* bring new ideas, and that is also worth something.  They may eventually fail to, but it's a great way to try out new ideas.


Bitcoin was taken seriously by it's creator, although it was(is) considered more of an experiment while DOGE was never intended to be taken seriously at all.


I think the big question here is "Why?"  Why would you use DOGE?  Why would a new cryptocurrency user use DOGE and not Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is:
* more stable
* easier to get
* accepted at actual global internet businesses
* worth over 500 times more in market cap

I've talked to a couple of people about bitcoins.  I love talking about something I'm excited about.  Some of them think I'm an idiot and most of them are skeptical and some end up getting excited about the technology but still haven't bought any - though some where close.  My one friend at work nearly bought $10k worth, another group wanted to start a joint mining operation, and my brother was super close to buying his own miner.
I think it's good for people to be skeptical.  Your default approach to anything should be skepticism which drives you to learn the truth.  I can tell people about why I believe in Bitcoin but that's it - i'm not a salesman, pushing people too hard just makes them think you're scamming them.  I'm simply sharing about something I think is exciting and I think Bitcoin is exciting.

That doesn't make sense.  You'd have to send the plaintext, salt, and the hash to the server, and also write your own algorithm in Javascript and potentially have a buggy implementation.  Since the hash is what's checked in the database, it wouldn't even matter what the password is, even though it's hashed!  It's as bad as storing passwords in plaintext!
EDIT: or do you mean you'd hash the hash again on the server?  In that case the original password is irrelevant as the 1st hash basically becomes the password.  Anyone who's compromised SSL and wants to attack the system will skip the client-side hash and send the already hashed password, which itself becomes the password.  They don't need to know what the "real" password is, so it's still not any more secure.

No, the law hasn't changed, the law requires tax to be paid on income and capital gains.
The problem was, it wasn't exactly clear how to file taxes with bitcoin assets.  There's a number of different ways you could have filed it, and it wasn't exceedingly clear which method to use.  The guidance they just released made it absolutely clear.
The only way you could consider this a post-ex facto law is if you believed previously that bitcoin was not going to being taxed - which was not the case.  It was always clear to tax professionals that bitcoin would be taxed under US law, and there was a lot of discussion on here about it before this guidance came out.  was set up long before this guidance was released using the same rules.

Best case scenario for bitcoin is that everyone uses it.  This means that the global money supply will essentially be converted to bitcoin.
Money supply is somewhat hard to define, because there are a number of different ways to count it.  We know there can only be 21 million bitcoins excluding fractional reserve banking, so we want to count all non fractional reserve money in the world.  However, that number isn't published, so I'm going to substitute M0 money supply instead which is $5.2 trillion US.  M0 is all the physical notes and currency.  You could use M2 instead, which includes Deposit accounts and travelers checks, but that includes money generated by fractional reserve banking and is a bad analog.  For the record, M2 is about $55 trillion US.  The real number would be somewhere between M0 and M2.
Based on M0 supply:
    $5.2 trillion US / 21 MBTC = ~$250,000 / bitcoin
Based on M2 supply:
    $55 trillion US / 21 MBTC = ~$2.6 million / bitcoin
Since the real number is somewhere between those, $1 Billion bitcoins are basically 1000 times more than is possible until the money supply grows that much.

We're out of huge leaps in hashing performance.  ASIC is it.  You can't get faster than dedicated hardware except incremental improvements from process shrinks and small optimizations and in general, more hardware.  ASIC mining is rapidly reaching the point where it will no longer be profitable to mine.  This is the wall.  At the wall, it doesn't matter how much gear you have because you'll never break even - mining profitability will be directly related to the price of BTC.  If it stays constant, people will shut down miners.  In 2016, the reward halves again, so unless value of BTC goes up significantly, mining for profit will be a thing of the past, at least for bitcoin.

Circle treats your order as a market order for the dollar amount equivalent requested.
If you enter 0.11 BTC, Circle creates an order for $39.75 (as I type this).  Because it's a market order, the rate isn't guaranteed and you could end up with either less or more.  In your case, slightly less.

I'm not a lawyer.
Your mistake is in thinking the law changed.  The IRS guidance is not law, it is instructions to help you fill out your taxes with a promise that if you do it that way you won't get in trouble if audited.  With or without the guidance, you still have to pay taxes on your bitcoin gains and income.  This is already covered by other sections of the tax code; the real question was whether or not bitcoin should be treated as a commodity, or foreign currency, which is what this guidance made clear.
It entirely possible that if you did it a different way, and filed as if it was a foreign currency that you will be okay and not get audited, but if you didn't include bitcoins in your taxes at all, then you broke the law.  Not the guidance, the law, because it was exceedingly clear that it falls under income and/or capital gains.


Why do you think this?  Your tax money goes the same place it went with dollars.  Check out [the federal income tax receipt]( once updated for the new year (that's from last year) to see exactly where your money's going.  Your money goes to infrastructure, education, healthcare, defense, unemployment benefits, etc, just like your tax from dollars.  This didn't change at all.


It's not really that hard.  Use  .  By next year, I'm sure wallets will even have this built in.  The great think about bitcoin is it's easy to get the transaction data from your addresses or online wallet, so you don't need to track this per transaction.  There are still many people that track every purchase made with check or bank card manually, so this isn't really a big expectation and can be automated.


1.  If you made a best effort to report your taxes on bitcoin before the guidance then it didn't change much.  (you may still even be okay, but I don't advise of it)
2.  You still have 15 days to file a correction.  That's more than enough time to export your transaction history, load into bitcointaxes.info, crunch the numbers, and file the paperwork to be in compliance.
The reason I suspect you're so mad is because you didn't pay any taxes at all on your bitcoins.  In which case, you somehow concluded that it's not a currency *or* a commodity.  if that's true, what exactly did you think it was?

That doesn't get your money back.  In my experience, people who "borrow" money from friends do so because they are bad at managing money, too impulsive and/or can't get a loan from an actual bank and will never pay it back.
The entire point of involving a third party would be to have them reduce the risk.  But not only does CF charge 25%, several times higher than a personal bank loan and far higher than I'd ever charge a friend, but they accept no risk and siphon off 60% of the profits for doing nothing.
I don't need an app to find people to ask me for money, and I certainly don't see a point of borrowing from friends at higher interest rates than a bank.  If the entire point is avoiding the evil banks, then we're just trading one evil for another.  With interest rates of 25% this is firmly in the realm of predatory lending.

1. Not innovative.  There where online music stores before iTunes.  iTunes was probably the most successful at convincing publishers to release their music online, and integration with the hardware MP3 player, but the tech itself was nothing new.
2. I think the iPod was probably the Apple product I was most impressed with.  Not because it looked good (the click wheel is a bizarre interface), but because the technology wasn't ready and they did it anyway.  Other MP3 players had just a few MB of flash, while Apple went and put a hard drive in it, making the best MP3 player on the market.  That was the closest I've ever been to buying an Apple product, and the only modern Apple product I can really say was 'innovative'.
3. Blackberry was the first real smartphone.  Apple's progress here wasn't technology, but loosening the carrier's iron grip of control.

The extra step of hashing on the client still doesn't get you anything.  The point of cryptography is to protect something.  The password is the method of controlling access, not the thing being protected.  In other words, it makes no sense to secure the password more than whatever the password is guarding.
The method you propose, runs hash h1(x) on the client and h2(x) on the server.  The password is therefor stored and checked with h2(h1(p)), with p being the user's password.
But, we're sending h1(p) through the wire.  The attacker now has h1(p).
At this point, the attacker doesn't care what p is.  All they need to do to own your account is load the form, and send h1(p) in the clientHash field.  The server accepts h1(p) as a valid clientHash, hashes with h2(x), and the attacker owns your account.
But wait! We've salted the hash functions!
It makes no difference.  The salt needs to be constant in order for the hash to return the same value.  If you send a different salt, then you have to rehash the password on the server, thereby needing to store the plaintext on the server which is obviously worse.
Your method just puts extra effort in securing the password over the actual communications channel, adding additional opportunities for bugs.

ETFs are pegged to the price of the asset through arbitrage.
To me, this is a way for traditional investors to get involved in a safe way.  ETFs are heavily regulated, unlike bitcoin exchanges like Mt Gox, and the Wilklevoss Twins have enough experience to manage it.  Investors won't have to know how to create a wallet and exchange funds, spend and receive bitcoin, but that's not their goal.  Their goal is to invest, no differently than an investor might invest in commodities.
This will almost certainly make the value go up which is good for everyone involved.  It doesn't effect people that want to use bitcoin as a currency any more than a currency trading account prevents people from using dollars or Euros.  It may even get investors interested enough to buy some directly and *start* using it as a currency.

There's about $60 Trillion in M2 Money supply in the world.  M2 money supply includes currency, and digital money such as checking and savings accounts that could be replaced with Bitcoin without resorting to fractional reserve.
If the world switched to bitcoin, all of the world's bitcoin would be worth the equivalent of that $60 Trillion in today's money.
1 bitcoin = 1 / 21,000,000th of the bitcoin money supply, which would be equivalent to the global money supply.
Therefore, 1 bitcoin would be worth an equivalent of roughly $3 million in today's money.
In terms of purchasing power, 1 bitcoin would be enough for several houses in an average city, a Bugatti Veyron, or 22 high-end Teslas, or 180 Ford Focuses.

Scrypt is a different hashing algorithm designed to be very memory-intensive.  SHA-256 is designed to be fast.  Scrypt is designed to be slow.
The SHA-256 altcoins are mined with ASICs as well.  Every SHA-256 coin has a much higher difficulty than any scrypt coin.  There are profit-switching pools on both algorithms, which tends to average out the profitability of all coins using the same algorithm.
Scrypt ASICs exist now, but they are buggy and barely faster than GPU miners, the reason being that the inherent complexity in the algorithm is very difficult to replicate in raw silicon.  They're also more expensive per hash than GPUs.  It will still be awhile until a significant portion of scrypt miners switch to ASICS, and at that point, miners may switch to other coins using keccak, adaptive script, or other algorythms.

I get that part of the premise of the idea is to replace banks, but I don't see value in replacing banks with something that's worse.  P2P doesn't automatically mean good, especially since the attraction of P2P is to cut out the middleman and reduce cost while the app does the opposite.
As a borrower, I can get an interest rate right now of 7% for an unsecured loan, but I have good credit.  With bad credit, I could get a loan at 17% which still beats the pants of CF.  As a homeowner, I can do even better and get a loan for just 3%.  While I might be willing to pay a little more to avoid an evil corporation, 200-800% more is completely beyond the realm of possibility.  With the idea of the app being that you can find trustworthy people to lend to, they need to target the low end of the spectrum at 3-7% in order to have any appeal outside the world of idealists.  I haven't even convinced a single person to BUY bitcoin, let alone pay several hundred percent extra back to avoid banks.  I guarantee that if I asked every single person I knew, they'd laugh in my face.  The vast majority of people don't have a significant enough problem with banks to even consider something like this even if the rates where competitive.
As a lender, my goals are to make profit and minimize risk.  CF's rate of 25% is attractive, but then they keep 40% of that so I'll net just 15% - but only if the loan is paid back.  CF does nothing to reduce the risk, but instead makes it more risky as I need to recover CF's portion of the profits as well.  The idea is that their part of the transaction is in vetting the borrowers through a web of trust, but these are *my friends*, so the app can't tell me anything I don't already know.  But this is all irrelevant because I'd never load to friends and family for profit anyway, let alone 25%.
And what is CF's role this whole time?  Nothing. They don't help you find borrowers or lenders, it's your own friends.  They don't help resolve disputes.  The don't help reduce risk.  They literally do nothing except create a fancy interface and take 60% of your profits.
This is WORSE than our centralized system.  CF rakes in 10% of every loan while providing negligible value.  Banks provide value - they take on the risk and lend at a reasonable rate.  I could just lend to my friends directly and never touch this app.
Let alone that it's ludicrous to go in bitcoin debt right now because the value could rise 10-fold in a year.

Yes, it's inevitable.
When mining goes unprofitable (as it is now), you're actually losing money by doing it.  Businesses exist to make money, and as such, will not do it at a loss.  They'll also be hit hardest, as someone with 1 million miners will lose money faster than someone with 1 by a factor of roughly 1 million.  When a business's core product isn't profitable, they fail or change their business plan.
As a user, however, it's certainly reasonable to mine at a slight loss to safeguard the network, or as an interesting hobby.  Many people are running full node despite that they aren't earning money, and many people are running applications like folding that also cost them money.

I don't ever understand these arguments.  Does silver make gold useless?  Do Euros make dollars useless?  Does the existence of more than one stock make the stock market useless?
The answer to all of these is no.  I own bitcoins today directly because of alts.  I didn't want to buy in directly, so I invested in mining instead.  At the point when I bought in, bitcoin mining would have been utterly unprofitable and far too risky for me (didn't want to invest in ASICs that have no other use), but instead I mined on a computer I already owned.  I've owned doge, ltc, and a bunch of other coins, and I've made money on most of them just by putting in limit orders and being a little patient instead of market price like the pools do.
Alts are useful for testing new ideas, when can then be implemented in bitcoin if they are beneficial.  They can also be good at generating interest.  Someone might be more willing to spend some money for "whole litecoins" or "a bunch of doge" than hold fractional btc.  Someone curious can still mine without spending money on a special purpose machine.  Doge has done great things to generate interest like sponsoring an Olympic team.
There's no reason to kill them.  If bitcoin continues to succeed, there will always be alts.  Good things will be copied.

If mortgages aren't possible, prices would go down.  People will always want to sell homes, and if there's no buyers, the prices will go down until there is.
I could move 20 miles from my current location and buy a house for $80k, slap on $10k of work and have a perfectly good house.  I know of one house that's $90k and comes with 4 acres of land.  I had a friend who owned a house in center-city Lebanon, PA which sold for a measly $27k, with 4 bedrooms and probably 2000 sq ft of living space.  If there was no mortgages, those prices might be 50% lower, putting it firmly in the realm of affordability.  So, that $250,000 house wont be a $250,000 house, it might be a $150,000 house, or maybe a $100,000 house.  And you don't have to live there, you can move somewhere where housing is affordable or where you can rent for a more reasonable price.  Your commute might be longer.  I know people that commute 40-60 miles to work, some to other states.  Some people telecommute to live where it's cheaper.


For some reason you're looking at this backwards.  You don't have a family that you can't afford to feed and house.  It doesn't make sense.  You don't have to have children, you could have fewer children.  If you have 5 kids and suddenly realize you can't afford a house, that's your lack of planning.


No, but again, there are cheaper options.  I have a friend who rents an entire house and acre of land for $400 / month.
Some models we live by are unsustainable.  Our debt society just keeps driving prices up and up and enslaving people to the banks for their entire life.  Everyone can't live in the same place, 5 minutes from work.  It drives up prices, it can't last.  Everyone can't have a pile of kids.  There's only so much space on this Earth and we keep using more and more of it.  We're hitting limits on what's possible with food production; we already couldn't survive without GMO crops.

I think the idea is if you *generate* your own power with wind or solar then it could be considered free, barring the initial investment.  Of course, you can typically sell that power back to the grid for profit for more than you'd earn mining, so mining still loses.

The problem is that the core devs aren't doing anything.  At least the XT folks have released developed a solution.

They're doubling the constant, not removing it.  Even if they where removing it, miners would still set block limits they where comforable with.  If you're worried about rogue miners generating massive blocks to screw up the network, well, that's just not economically feasible as they'd be more likely to get orphaned.


Just assuming it's linear (which it's not according to thier own calculations), 11 minutes / 4 = 2.76 minutes to hash, assuming the block has just one transaction, which isn't a problem yet.  This won't be the case for most blocks and miners have little incentive to mine blocks like this.


This says a 2MB block could take 10 minutes, which disagrees with  the previous source, but basically I get that your point is that it takes a long time. Still, miners won't include these transactions, because they'll lead to higher orphan rates.
Core dev's "solution" segwit doesn't solve this either.

The only one of these that REALLY addresses the block size issue seems to be IBLT.  Segwit is bizarre, hacky, and barely raises the size limit, and probably the worst possible solution anyone's thought of.  If we're stuck with it, fine.  I'm still on board if it moves us forward, but the aversion to a hard fork is nonsensical, especially while we're still in the early adopter phase when there's a glaring problem.

Full disclosure: I own and support bitcoin - I just disagree with the premise of the Rodriguez's tweet and this argument.


Those limitations are for fraud / theft protection or required by law for anti-money laundering, not because the bank feels like making your life difficult, and neither of which bitcoin solves or avoids legally.
You can spend more than those limits of you get a certified check which isn't difficult for those rare times you actually want to spend that much.  I've bought cars with regular checks with no problem.  So, they don't really prevent you from doing it at all - you just have to do it their way.


Again, fraud protection, because it's likely to be fraud if a transaction appears in a foreign country for your account unexpectedly.  Since the bank guarantees your money, I think it's reasonable for them to take precautions to safeguard it.  It's also avoidable if you call the bank and tell them in advance you're leaving the country.


Sure, I'll agree that's a real problem.  Technically speaking, Bitcoin doesn't solve this, it just makes it easy to circumvent the law.


Tecnically, yes, but realistically it can be avoided by simply: not traveling with large sums of cash and not storing money in your Paypal account.  I've never heard of an actual bank stealing or denying anyone access to their money so long as they use the proper channels afforded to them.
Bitcoin as it currently stands doesn't solve this problem either.  The blockchain can't handle enough volume to do all transactions on chain, so payment processors would have to be used, and then there's still someone functioning as a 'bank' who has access to your money or could be coerced by governments to deny you access to it or take it outright.

Mortgage interest rates on a fixed rate loan are related to inflation only at the time of purchase in that the rate is chosen by the bank so that they ultimately profit from the loan over it's term.  As soon as you sign, however, it's no longer correlated - regardless of whether inflation or deflation occurs, your payment stays the same, which is the point I'm making.
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:23:27
As a homeowner, the problem isn't a conspiracy against poor people but rather that housing costs have gone up by a similar rate.  This also isn't due to a conspiracy against poor people but simple supply and demand and the fact that there's a limited amount of housing and therefore scales at a faster rate as more and more people are fighting for the same homes.
If I where to be a landlord (which I have no desire to), the price I'd have to charge *would* be high because it has to cover my expenses of mortgage, insurance, maintenance, and time between renters, which ultimately leads to a higher price than I'm currently paying.  Renting is a business like any other and no one does it at a loss.  The good thing about home ownership is that at least the mortgage cost is pinned to the time of purchase and isn't affected by inflation so that every time I get a salary increase it *is* a lower portion of my income.  However those other costs still apply - insurance and maintenance costs go up.
Income inequality isn't a problem of inflationary monetary policy either (which bitcoin is current under for the next 100 years or so), but rather business owners and corporations continually paying their employees a low salary while taking a larger and larger chunk of income for themselves.  IMO the ideal solution for this is to pose a cap on the ratio of highest:lowest paid workers, but that doesn't solve the housing cost problem either which can only be solved by building housing at a fast enough rate to keep up with the demand for it.

The mining payout drops in half.  Currently, every block mined pays out 25BTC + fees, but that's dropping to 12.5BTC + fees.  This will happen every 4 years until all bitcoin has been distributed.

There is no "official value" of bitcoin.  The value is whatever is determined for supply and demand.  If two people are willing to exchange BTC for USD at $700, the value is $700.  If another exchange happens at $701, then the value rises to $701, and so on...the value continually adjusts based on supply and demand.

Most of that CAN'T be privatized.  How would you afford your on military, bodyguards, fire department, doctors and teachers?  How are you going to get anywhere when no one can build roads?  The only reason we can build roads and have a highway system is because the government can seize land to do it.  You couldn't build private roads without taking land by force as all land is owned and in addition no one would put up the cash to do it.  It would be utter chaos.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:13:51
That's a shortsighted perspective though, because it hampers further adoption, and inhibits further innovation on blockchain uses.  Both of which should improve the price and value of the miner reward going forward.

I don't see how you could any more effectively privatize police or roads so how am I supposed to know your exception is military?  I'm still not sure if that's what you're talking about.
EDIT: You ninja edited on me.


Because it would be chaos.  What are they going to do with lawbreakers?  What laws are they going to enforce?  Who's going to make the laws?  Why would they voluntarily risk their lives to hunt down violent people for nothing, and then still do another job?
Roads can't be privatized.  Not anymore.  There's no land left, so they'd have to buy it all, by convincing thousands of people to sell voluntarily or take it by force with a private army which is completely unrealistic.  Even when the government demands people give up land some still fight it.

How so?  The lightning network moves transactions off the chain into payment channels.  Every resource on the first page of search results for "Lightning Network" calls them off-chain transactions.


I don't disagree with a cautious approach, but the impact of not doing it is the BCash and B2X splits, one of which is actively damaging the stability of the bitcoin network, and the other could take away 80% of hashing power, plus potentially more with cross-mining of BTC and BCH.  How is it better to continue down this path than accept the 2MB increase, which was agreed upon 18 months ago?

I too believe in core and segwit.  Sold my bcash right away.  But at what point do we acknowledge that being bullheaded about the block size increase is hurting us?  Agreeing to 2MB blocks + Segwit would have avoided both forks, the bcash mining fluctuations, as well as market share decreasing by half.  Why shouldn't miners have a say in the development of bitcoin?  First mover advantage only goes so far, we need to innovate and stay ahead.  We're effectively giving up on on-chain scaling with Lightning Network, but other coins can do it.

Yeah except there are fundamental physical limits we're approaching, things like the amount of distance electricity can actually travel in a clock cycle, and how fast transistors can switch, which is why max clock speeds of processors haven't changed significantly for the past decade while the decade before they increased by a factor of 100.
There are other physical limits too such as that there's a limit to how much data can fundamentally be sent for a given bandwidth.  While we're still improving, it's becoming harder and harder to do so, and will eventually either not be possible or require new paradigms like optical computing which has it's own physical limitations as well and possibly other tradeoffs.

I don't think those would really be options.
I'm not sure if it's even possible to use bitsquare without interacting with the banking system in some way, considering you don't meet with the person you're exchanging with and can't send cash.
Localbitcoins would almost certainly block US customers or risk having their domain seized; and if not, few people are going to use it at the risk of getting busted.  Considering you have to meet with the person, what would stop government agents from posing as traders, and busting people at the meetup?
Even if it did work, what's the point of owning unspendable currency?  You can't interact with the banking system or risk KYC/AML checks, and can't make any large purchases either.

Ok, but to my knowledge, the community is overwhelmingly in favor of scaling, just divided about the solution.  Segwit and big blocks will both require more resources, I'm not sure there's any way around that, which allows both nodes to validate blocks and increase throughout.  And not ~~asking~~ scaling means Bitcoin will never take the volume too be a mainstream currency.  Ultimately, I think we'll see companies getting into the Bitcoin space set up node for direct access to the blockchain and to be able to secure the investment in the Bitcoin space.

I disagree for two reasons: 1) the bitcoin whitepaper itself mentions the inability to perform microtransactions among the drawbacks of other payment systems.  It seems unlikely Satoshi would mention this if solving it wasn't a goal of bitcoin, and 2) it eliminates the possibility of the bitcoin blockchain from being used for anything except financial transactions.
Furthermore, we can't really replace banks with bitcon without the ability to buy a cup of coffee.  There's going to have to be a middleman, or another currency we use for day to day things, that's being managed by an organization that takes the role of a bank.  We can't replace their role, until we can perform all the functions of traditional currency, which includes buying a coffee.
And finally, not a reason, per se, but I think the community by and large wants a scaling solution.

I think Asicboost is bad because it disensentivises the miners to accept some of the changes that will advance the network.  Core isn't obligated to support it, but if they don't, then miners could block improvements.  Also it encourages a monopoly of the one company who can make Asicboost miners, which is very bad.

An interesting thought experiment, but not actually possible.  What would happen when a car went bankrupt, or was permanently repairable?  What happens if it's Internet connection breaks, or it breaks down in an area without cell reception?
What happens if a person damages it, or just decides they own it?
Disregarding that there's no legal system in the world that allows anything but a human to "own" things, how does the car get to be self-owned in the first place?  At some point an owner would have to relinquish control of it, either the factory who made it or a human owner in exchange for the lease payments, but why would they not just retain ownership and continue earning profit?  I suppose a government could also set this up, but then why bother with making each one it's own corporation?
And what's even the point of machine ownership?  I can't think of a single benefit of having a machine "own" something.  Ownership is about profit, control, liability, and rights, none of which matter for an inanimate object.

Could bitcoin fail? 
Certainly.  Andreas Antonopolous considers bitcoin to be a great experiment and he's far more of an expert than I would consider myself to be.
The best product often doesn't succeed in a free market.
I think the biggest risk at this point is adoption.  Sure, bitcoin is decentralized and anonymity and all that jazz, but many people don't care about that.  Most people just want to pay for their groceries and not have their money stolen.  Bitcoin at this point requires extra steps to do that and the lack of chargebacks isn't something the average consumer wants.
There's also risk from government banning it, but when is the last time you've seen a government turn away money?
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:38:48
When they can't stop bitcoin directly, making it illegal and preventing legitimate businesses from transacting with it will make it essentially worthless in those countries.

This was never the case. It may be the case that you could get away with not paying, and likewise with Bitcoin, but legally speaking there's no doubt over the fact that the United States requires income tax to be paid on income of any sort, including Bitcoin.

Traditional payment systems have a confirmation time way longer than bitcoin, usually days, not minutes, with credit cards allowing MONTHS before the transaction is truly confirmed in the sense that it can no longer be reversed.
They simply don't wait for it to be confirmed before delivering the goods, as is equally possible with bitcoin.

True, but bitcoin is small enough that external forces are affecting the price more at this point.  Despite increasing the supply by 8%, we're sitting at a higher value than last year.  The inflow from other currencies is eating up the inflation at the moment, and then some.
If this holds up through next year when the block size halves, that could trigger a steeper uptrend in value.

So, each mod just creates hundreds of accounts and posts with each one.  "Provably fair" chance then selects a mod with high probability, even if the choice of username is actually random.
It would be better to require people to pay to enter, but that probably isn't legal, and still wouldn't prevent the mods from pooling their money and buying thousands of entries.

They don't want to change the algorithm from SHA-256, they want to change the hardware implementation of the algorithm to perform better.
They want to swap out a component that is always right, for one that sometimes has errors.  This sounds like a problem, but correct solutions will be validated by nodes and incorrect solutions will not be added to the blockchain.
So, they'll improve the hash rate by something like 10%, while increasing the error rate to something like 5% for an overall performance gain of 5%.
This is in theory of course.

Fees will lower demand.
Mining profitability isn't a driving factor in the value of bitcoin nor is it important to non-mining bitcoin users.  The same amount of bitcoin will be mined either way, and there's *some* hashrate for which mining will be profitable, so someone will continue mining - the network would still be extremely secure if the hashrate halved right now.
@_date: 2016-05-10 23:24:59
Yes, but most often the prices for all payment methods are the same, so you're paying a portion of the fees whether or not you're benefiting from it.  I have a cashback card and pay LESS when I use the card and get the protection as a bonus.  The cash customers, and for business' that accept it, bitcoin customers as well are bearing more of that cost without the benefit.
And it's certainly something people want.  Credit Card companies wouldn't include it if they didn't.  It doesn't benefit them - it makes them the middleman on disputes they could otherwise ignore which adds cost and overhead.


People have learned to deal with it by using banks, credit cards, and the fraud protection they offer instead of carrying physical cash around.
I love bitcoin, but ultimately I don't consider this a benefit.

I would disagree but it certainly depends on how you interpret the concept of intrinsic value.  I'd say gold (and other precious metals) has intrinsic value, but you could certainly make the argument that gold by itself is just a piece of metal, until it's given a purpose.

Coinbase also pays transaction fees for you when necessary so it seems reasonable to avoid them when possible.  Also, with block sizes approaching the limit it will soon become *necessary* to do off-chain transactions if it isn't already.

Comparing MySQL to Oracle is like comparing a McDonald's hamburger to a meal cooked by a five star chef.  Sure the McD's burger is food, but it has little nutritional value, overcooked, bland, and covered in pickles that have sat at room temperature for hours.

Who's going to volunteer after the first 101 people go to jail?  This isn't even the point.  The wouldn't have to go out of their way to find these people, just put the names in a police database, and the next time you get pulled over for speeding you end up in jail instead of getting a ticked.
The point is, you're extremely limited in what you can do as a successful business venture without holding any assets, property, or any known employees.  Sooner or later, somebody has to put their name on something to actually buy it, and then that's the person you can go after.
Another problem - digital consensus or not, the person who's actual name is on property is the owner by law.  You elect Bob to maintain the website so he buys the domain.  Now he owns it.  You CANT fire him, he owns the domain and the company has no recourse to get it back.  And you can't make the 'corporation' the owner, because it doesn't legally exist.  To legally exist, it has to file the legal paperwork, and the company then has to run in the bounds of the law.  The loopholes here are VERY small.

DNS's primary function is to map names to IP addresses.  I'm not sure how you can say this is a deficiency as there needs to be some way to do this, and a dictionary of names to IPs is about the simplest and lowest latency method possible.
The ability to use different names for sites can be served by bookmarks.  The web server requires knowing the exact domain you're trying to visit in many cases and there's no need for an over-engineered solution.

I can't think of a compelling reason why demand for bitcoin would change so to me the question is how much of newly mined bitcoin ends up in the supply for exchanges, and what percentage of the supply on exchanges is from fresh bitcoin?
If any significant portion of trading volume is fresh coin, the supply will drop and value will increase.  I suspect this will be the case.
No matter what happens, it will get priced in ahead of time, so don't expect a big jump in price at the halvening, but long-term barring other trends this should result in an increase in price.

Very clever, but it looks like the data is stored in the least significant bits of the image data, which makes the most sense from a stenography perspective, but will also ensure that the data gets stripped out if the image is recompressed.

You also wouldn't be able to print it out and use the paper picture as a wallet as one person mentions, as no scanner is going to be precise enough to recover the data.

That's not intrinsic.
Intrinsic value is only the value of the money itself, not it's uses.  A dollar is just some ink on a paper.  A coin is just some cheap metal with a face stamped on it.  A bitcoin is just a record in a database somewhere.  None of these are intrinsically valuable, as opposed to coins made of actual precious metals, like gold, silver, or platinum.

I disagree.  Technically speaking, you still own something regardless of who you contract it's security to.  Money in your bank account is still *your* money, even though you don't have it in a vault in your house.  
If by 'own' you mean the government can't take it, well that's false - just ask DPR.
Secondly, most people I don't trust to secure their own bitcoins, it makes sense for someone to contract security to someone more qualified, just as it makes sense to hire bodyguards if you're a high profile person.  There's not a single person I know that I'd trust to secure it themselves, so either I recommend it to no one or recommend online wallets at a regulated exchange.

Sure, but according to laws in the US, they could also seize your money if it's physical cash in your immediate possession.  Ultimately, ownership is defined by laws, and enforced through government.  Regardless of who has something, the government decides who owns it, and who *can* own it.  And that means that we're left with: who's going to be the best person to entrust the security of your bitcoins to?  Is it you, or is it someone else?

That's not where real competition will come from.  None can compete with bitcoin because none have made a significant technological improvement upon bitcoin, made it easier to use or offered any additional incentives to use it.
It could however, be superceded if a country where to create a cryptocurrency to replace it's national currency.  If the US gov't where to create dollarcoin, allow no other payment options for doing business with the US government, and require it to be accepted as payment for debts as with the dollar, then if would immediately be larger.  It wouldn't matter if it where premined (and it obviously would be) if it where the only option to be used to pay taxes and avoid jail; it would immediately become the largest cryptocurrency in the world.
It's also conceivable that a coin *could* be created that would improve upon the technology of bitcoin, replacing it before it ever reaches mass adoption.
There's also several completely new technologies in bitcoin that could be used in other projects.  Distributed Consensus, Proof-of-work, the best current solution for the double-spend problem etc.
So yes, I think the currency and tech are separable, and the tech is the more valuable part.
