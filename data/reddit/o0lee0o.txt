In fact why on earth would you want to avoid providing your ID so much that your willing to pay an 8% fee on transactions? Your throwing money away.

Standard KYC checks to prevent fraud, you have nothing to hide do you?

I’ve not heard of any cases of identity theft on these exchanges as yet, KYC (know your customer) checks are something that I provide on a regular basis for my side business for anything financially related. In the UK it’s required by law and it’s the same if you find exchanges in USA, China etc. So find a company that is well known and you’ll be fine.

So far I’ve used Coinbase for easy and quick card transactions, then I moved on to use Binance and GDAX.  I’ve not had an issue yet but and I’m sure others can point out additional exchanges that I’ve not used.

To be fair I only thought of it from the UK's perspective, it makes sense in restricted areas to accept cryptos. Although I imagine there's going to be some rogue outfits accepting bitcoin at bookies and casino's, I have a hard enough time getting my money out of well regulated ones. 
***edit*** Scrap my last comment, smart contract agreements from the likes of Ethereum would work well.

Really? I'm a member of over 50 bookies and countless casino's and I've never seen an option to deposit with bitcoin.

No, bookies and casino's will only allow you to withdraw in the same method you deposited.
