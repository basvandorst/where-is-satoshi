Tesla or nothing.. it will outlive the owner. These numbers of 300k on a Camry are old news

I'll just say one thing. Trillion dollar flow into Bitcoin doesn't mean the market cap goes up by a trillion. In fact it goes up way more. I think its something like 5-10x. I remember Tom Lee talking about it

There's ALWAYS enough Bitcoin. People don't understand economics who say there won't be. Sure supply is limited, but many other things are limited too. Land for example, yet there is always people selling and people buying. There is also periods where demand out numbers supply or vice versa. When suddenly everyone wants BTC, and there's not that much being mined, the price will go up, hodlers will become sellers and will sell (at least a portion of them). Same thing happens with every asset and especially BTC  . Smart money sells when the value of the asset is over inflated. For example, in 2017. Look up hodl waves, explains this phenomenon nicely.

It's already come down 50% from the recent 14k high, even more so from the all time high. Greed works in both directions. It causes people to miss out at 3500 waiting for 2k

I think the point you're missing is that you can't judge the tech on by what it is this moment, only on where it will be. But judging by where it is today it is still phenomenal in so many respects. Unfortunately, to really comprehend all the implications , you have to understand a variety of complex topics like finance, economics, politics, social and technological trends , money, inflation etc  . It will go over most people's head. But back to my point, people said the same about the internet, cars, etc. "Why would I use a car, horses are way better and more reliable and don't need gasoline. Nobody will ever use computers. The internet is for nerds ". And so on  lastly, ask yourself where else a new type of money is being designed, and if there were a new system of new money what would it look like ? Bitcoin is on that path if not already almost there
