Is it gone?

At the end of my workday on Friday I was doing a little BTC trading at my desk and chatting to a couple co-workers. 
Ended up with 4 of us sitting there for over an hour talking about cryptos and watching the GDAX Bitcoin trades on my screen. 
So it's not just you, it's pretty fascinating to watch.

Easycrypto is the easiest place to buy it in NZ. They're an NZ company.

Ah my old hometown. That screams of a scam though. Londy will be taking your money while making you think he/she is enabling you to get rich.

The ledger is public, so that's false lol.

But aren't there Chinese exchanges? Binance? Why would they censor Bitcoin when they allow it to be traded?

It's inevitable, it just makes sense for most people and businesses.
At least those of us who are so inclined, have the ability to be our own bank if we want to.

IMO If you're going to give this kind of business another shot, I think a better approach is integration with a hardware wallet.   
For convenience, you could additionally create a local wallet that can store a small amount of funds so that the user can do multiple small transactions without plugging in the HW wallet each time.  
I think that's better than having the user store their funds on a site like Coinbase and giving the browser extension direct access to it - that's just begging for another major hack that'll make headlines...

Just buying any major crypto with that money instead would have worked out better...

Should say SODL ON... at the right time.
Lucky bastard.

Probably not directly, seems the direction Bitcoin is going will requirement most people to use banks which would hold Bitcoin in a similar way to crypto exchanges (although with better security and regulations I'd hope). 
The banks would then have Lightning channels and do a periodic settlement on chain... which is kind of similar to the current credit card system. 
That's how I imagine it. I don't see the current direction becoming directly accessible to regular non-technical people.

Guess it means having his bank account cancelled? Not sure though.
Anyway, ANZ and ASB seem to be reasonably crypto friendly. Remember international transactions in NZ over $10k NZD get reported to police so if you're above that make sure you've got records in order and pay your taxes.
If you want to keep it under the radar, sell for cash directly with buyers.

" He asked for my wallet ID and my password."
Random dude on the internet asking for your password and you actually consider giving it to him... dude seriously you need to be less gullible or you're going to get taken advantage of in life, not only here.

Going too far. Face it, if you put "should we delist coin X" polls on Twitter, most coins would have a majority vote to delist because everybody wants to damage the projects that compete with their investments. 
BSV was not only a joke of a project but it was headed up by a fraudster (and his buddy Calvin seems shady but I don't know much about him) AND was deliberately targeting members of the community with legal threats.    
It was actively causing harm and headed up by criminals.   
Although it's a pity some obvious scam projects like Bitconnect didn't get the same treatment.

So you're paying $300 for a Rasperri Pi with pre-configured software, in a box that doesn't even route the wiring properly.
The logo even looks like a sticker, did they just buy some generic Rasprerri Pi boxes on Ali Express and put their stickers on them?
This looks like a rip-off. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:15:14
For a $300 device there sure as hell is something wrong with it - it gives the appearance of a device with virtually no real R&amp;D, made to make money from suckers.

I think the piss poor security from Electrum **should** sour people away from it. It's a giant red flag showing how insecure the application is, not good enough for a financial application aimed at general users.

Imagine the shock and hilarity if McAfee turns out to be Satoshi.

So this wallet app connects to random servers by default that could be hosted by anyone?
That seems like a terrible idea. Why?
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:45:46
They control the code, they have that power already. There are just certain things where you'd rather know who is in control and this is one of them. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:58:25
Regular people cannot read and understand code. And they're certaionly not each going to give it a full audit before downloading every update. A compromised Github account can easily do a lot of damage.

"They should learn, or pay someone who knows, or rely on volunteers."
Not going to happen with everyday apps like this when regular people use then. Saying they should, is never going to make it so. 
Fact is applications like this need to be more secure otherwise they are not suitable for everyday people. It's up to those in the know like us to inform regular people, and letting security a flaw like this get through is a major fail.
Do other software wallets work like this? I only use a Nano Ledger myself so I haven't looked at them closely. 
The crypto community is far too tolerant of weak security and we're leading regular people right into the hands of hackers. Web wallets that require you to input your private keys to a web page, software wallets that store private keys in text files, and now software wallets that connect to completely random servers that can send them messages that look like notifications from the app... these are all terrible and giving crypto a bad name, we're handing over regular people to hackers and allowing fraud on a scale that makes every other type of fraudster green with envy..

Trustless decentralisation doesn't work for everything, if a person chooses a particular wallet they're choosing to trust the devs of that wallet to keep their funds secure, not any random fool that can fire up a server. 
They've opened up a huge exploit and enabled their users to be scammed via their own application because they allowed any random person to run a critical part of their infrastructure, this isn't as obvious as a regular phising attack.
Just another reason to steer clear of software wallets unless you're technical enough to add on your own security mreasures.
