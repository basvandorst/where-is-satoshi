It's not illegal, no. People ask for ID in order to protect their bank accounts from fraud. If you are trading in cash or have some other way to mitigate fraud risk it's legally ok to not ask for ID.

probably not.. it would be difficult to enumerate all addresses starting with 3 since they are hashes of scripts that also need to be valid, and there's probably no easy way to enumerate all possible valid bitcoin scripts.. although I suppose if you don't care about having lots of impossible ones in there you could just enumerate every byte pattern up to whatever the maximum script length is...

IMO, kraken is not a good option for GBP. If it's a small amount the minimum £10 deposit fee on top of whatever your bank charges for sending the swift wire will make it expensive.. for large amounts kraken's GBP market is too thin (&lt;100 coins traded per day). If you want to use kraken just use their EUR account and trade in EUR. Open a [fidoruk bank account]( in order to send SEPA EUR transfers for £2.49.

It's easier to steal someone's bank account than their bank account and their ID.. and if someone tries it with their own account you at least know who they are and can take them to court. Some people ask for an additional pic of you holding your ID as that would be harder still for a fraudster. It's not perfect, but nothing is.

I don't think any do.

Doubtful. You're better off skipping the virtual visa and using a cash deposit into someone's bank account instead. That also normally does not require ID. Use the vanilla card for other expenses instead.
