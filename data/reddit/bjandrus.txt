I agree; this system would make for easy integration with those sane countries that already use SI units but would be lost on us dumb Americans who for some reason insist on measuring in feet, gallons, and pounds.

I recently downloaded the bitpay app. Should I be worried? Anyone have any suggestions for wallets I can trust? It seems every wallet in existence is a scam...

That's cool and all, but doesn't this hurt transaction verification speed by cluttering up the ledger with all this superfluous bullshit? I mean why can't they start their own chain? Why the need to piggyback off Bitcoin's??

Lol that's kinda why I like it...going through and reading posts about people's trashy life problems is a guilty pleasure of mine

As if anyone on r/legaladvice ever offers any legitimate legal advice anyway. And I think it does answer his question...his money will be stored where his parents won't have access, problem solved

Well their technically right on one thing; manually trading is likely to lose you money (unless you really know what you're doing)...that's why I just hodl it!

Technically they're not lying; the IRS won't prosecute illegally obtained income...but nothing is stopping them from passing that form along to the DEA who most certainly will

I have decals on my vehicle stating I accept Bitcoin. If a passenger elects to use Bitcoin they need to let me know before I start the ride so I can cancel it. Then I would simply continue to take them to their original destination and recalculate the fare in fiat based on Uber's rates  ($0.75/mile + $0.25/min I believe) and convert that amount to Bitcoin according to current market price; which they would transfer to my mobile wallet after the ride completes.

I am an Uber driver and I already accept Bitcoin for rides; though admittedly the process is a bit of a pain in the ass since you can't do this through the Uber app. So really I'm just providing off the books rides for Bitcoin (At least theoretically I would be; in actuality I have yet to have a passenger want to use Bitcoin)

Exactly, and I can refuse rides to whomever. And it's not like I'd charge them... I can choose to cancel without charging the cancellation fee. Really though, it would just be a helluva lot easier if you could just accept Bitcoin through the app ;)
