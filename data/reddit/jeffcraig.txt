Yes. And just like when it was at 18k, I’ll tell you to sell at 50k and rebuy when it crashes to 25k.
Or do you not like doubling your investment?
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:30:54
Collect as many excuses as you want, but the truth is that the market **wants** to come down. It's crazy over-valued and will continue this downward trend until it reaches a reasonable value. All these stuff creates dips and spikes, but the downward trend is inevitable.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:39:04
I wonder how many people bought in at $1000 at the end of 2013 and then sold out sometime during the next 3 years when bitcoin was stagnant?
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:28:44
No. Major retailers like NewEgg do mass orders for companies. If you want to buy $50k or more worth of GPU, they will set up a special order for you.
GPU manufactures understand that the current demand won't last indefinitely, so they won't increase production. If they did, they would be risking overproducing, which would destroy their profits.

Honest question: why use Coinbase when you can purchase without fees on GDAX into the same account?
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:16:26
Uh... except that doesn't work in this case. GPU manufacturers aren't going to increase supply because it would open them up to unnecessary risk.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:32:40
I know the market is inflated and will come down to about 8k, so the highs/lows don't really surprise me at all.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:31:00
We'll also get a nice BTC dip to buy up :D
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:26:15
The fact that this gets upvoted to the top of the subreddit is exactly why I don't come here anymore. 
WTF even is this shit?
Bitcoin price isn't even down. It's still up 1000% from last year at this time. What don't you people understand about a spike and correction?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:38:05
Why are people “buying dips” at an avarage of almost 12k when all month there have been dips down to 9k.
I don’t think you understand what a dip is.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:33:07
Are you fucking kidding me? Our entire civilization is built on that trust.
Go back to spamming your memes. It's clear you have fucking clue.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:43:08
I don't see why it's "concern". We know the market is over-inflated and 8k is a reasonable price considering the current cost and difficulty of mining. The market always cools after a major spike. Once we get down to a reasonable price, the volatility should level out, we'll have a few months of flat and then it will continue the reasonable rise that we've seen over the lifespan of the coin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:29:07
lol the last article said it was going to 100k.
Now we're down to 40k
next week they'll just be predicting it going back to 20k
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:38:11
Exactly. You really have to think of Tether as the Fed. They print and destroy USDT as needed to match the market cap. For every dollar USD of market cap the coin has, there needs to be 1 USDT.
They really do need to produce a valid audit though. We've had enough FUD recently, and if this stuff hits mainstream there could be a pretty big selloff. Hopefully most of the 1.6 billion USDT is held by exchanges that know better.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:47:25
Right. It's not considered "switching", since it's the same platform. If they don't know that, then they're probably lumped into the group of people that shouldn't be fucking around with crypto-currencies.
The general idea is that if you have a Coinbase account, and you are already using that, there's no reason not to use GDAX and avoid the processing fees.
Ideally, you would want to switch to something else, but with CEX.IO registration offline and the process for most other places being extremely difficult/long, everyone is pretty much in the same boat here.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:46:57
How the fuck does this work if the people buying the stuff have to accept a 10-30% loss? People want bitcoin this badly? 
I'd do it if I got an extra 15% for providing you a service. But the way this is setup doesn't seem like it will work in the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:55:24
You're somewhat correct.
A crypto-currencies value *should* be tied to the cost of mining a coin. As the difficulty of a coin increases, so do the cost and the value. In this way, the value is predictable. The reason that people mine the coin is because there is a demand to use the coin to trade for goods and services. As the demand increases, so does the value.
What we're seeing with Bitcoin is market speculation, like you discussed. People are stockpiling it in hopes that it will increase in value. In some cases, this is true. As long as there is a use for Bitcoin, more and more people will mine it, and the difficulty, cost and value will always increase slowly over time.
What we're going through right now is a scenario where people stopped actually using the currency because they think of it as an investment. Hoarding causes scarcity, which increases price. However, at some point, the price becomes too risky, and the speculators being a selloff, which we're obviously starting to see now. 
3 months ago, Bitcoins price was fairly stable. 3,000 to 4,000 is a fair price for a coin, given the current cost involved to mine one. After the massive value adjustments of the past month, people will start to realize that Bitcoin is far too volatile if it's used for speculation instead of actually currency. I think we'll continue to see it tumble until it's closer to what it's actual value is (maybe 6k). After that, you won't see as many people running to invest in it and it will continue its slow climb at a reasonable pace. 
OPs flow-chart is kinda correct, in that it will take 10-20 years for Bitcoin to get back to the 17k peak that we just saw. If you didn't sell at the peak, you're going to have to hodl for a while before it's worth that much again.

All crypto-currency values are tied to Bitcoin. If you don't know this by now, you shouldn't be trying to invest in crytpo-coins.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:48:03
I guess some people just like learning the hard way...
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:45:22
And when you are turning to run away with everyone's BTC :D

Stop posting Forbes articles in general. That org is trash now from start to finish.

You should probably let someone else handle your investments then.

1000 Bitcoin at $1 is the same value as 1 Bitcoin at $1000. The dark web isn't trying to use it as an investment vehicle... they're just using it for anonanimity.
The only thing that stabilizes Bitcoin prices is the demand for investment. The floor is determined by scarcity and investor interest... just like any other commodity.
With stock markets entering a bear phase, investors are looking to liquidate their positions in anything that is percieved as volitial or is an unknown. Crypto has shown to be on a long downward trend, and past behaviors predict that it will be some time before we see another spike.

Rule  about Bitcoin is: never listen to @_date: 2018-02-06 20:12:00
There may be some loose correlation but it's difficult to tell.
The markets themselves don't have anything to do with each other, but during periods of perceived prosperity, the general consensus of the population hive-mind will be more likely to invest in higher risk prospects. 
The stability of the US economy and markets did have a large effect on peoples willingness to jump into crypto, but it's not a 1:1 correlation.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:48:50
More money would have to be invested in crypto than the entire world economy for that to happen.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:17:37
I received so many downvotes for telling people to sell at 18K :(
I should have just posted HODL memes.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:00:29
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:06:49
Honestly, I would be fucking amazed if someone put out a news article that just said: "Bitcoin to stay around 8k for a while."
Every fucking article is either doom or dream.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:01:10
and by normalize, I hope you mean continue a slow downward trend for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:07:02
If you buy during a massive spike maybe, but all the long term crypto investors are still up 10x or more.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:26:34
I'm just here until the major corperations realize that crypto is a good way to avoid sovereignty and taxes. I wanna see what everyone has to say about it then.

8% of the Dow is almost 1 trillion USD, which is more than Bitcoins market cap will probably ever be.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:36:41
Hmm. I predicted that 18k was the peak... and that btc would cool to around 6k for about a year before it started moving again.
You can't know 100%, but you can make pretty close educated guesses if you pay attention.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:03:44
lol have you not been paying any attention to anything? DJI is still way higher than it's ever been. It had solid gains for over 400 days, which is unheard of and everyone expected a correction. Fiat is literally stronger now that it has ever been.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:34:08
You must be talking to a bunch of people that are new to crypto. Anyone not rich after last year is never going to.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:26:51
Yeah it's pretty obvious.
Sure... fud will drive prices down, but I've been saying since we hit 18k that a correction was coming and 8k was probably a reasonable bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:15:12
So exactly like how the US treats it as well.
Someone should put a news article out saying the US hates bitcoin as much as Inida... see how far we can ride this thing down.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:27:38
India is a large consumer of Bitcoin because drugs.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:14:45
That's like 2 trillion USD market capital. 6 times more than the market cap of bitcoin has ever been.

Maybe do a little research: 
The amount and quality of debt has drastically increased since the subprime mortgage crisis, even way over 2007 levels.
