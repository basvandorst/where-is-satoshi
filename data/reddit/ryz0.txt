Harvesting adrenochrome is the very definition harm and suffering. Adrenochrome is the oxidase of adrenaline. They extract it by getting the victim into a state of extreme high stress and trauma. It is total disgusting evil what these bastards do to people to get this stuff.

Adrenochrome harvesters are the most despicable sickest fucks on the planet. Psychopaths and pedophiles. 
Ephesians 6:12

The Usurers are not Semitic (‘Middle Eastern’), they’re roots are in the old Khazarian empire (Eastern European) that forced converted to Jewdaism. They who say they are Jews but are not. Babylonian Talmudic, not Torah
