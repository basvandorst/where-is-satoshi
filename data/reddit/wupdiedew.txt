For example, the market booms. Sell 3 deviations upward from the mean and after it goes back to mean again buy within 1 deviation of this mean. 
How to determine mean and standard deviation? 
You take a 20 day moving average. Log the price action for every day. Let's say during these 20 days 78 is the lowest and 98 is the highest. With all kinds of numbers in between. Now you've got a 20 number sample. Calculate the mean, standard deviations, apply before mentioned rule.

I can say the same to you as well. Let this person comment and behave towards this kid how he/she feels like. Let him use his freedom as he wants.

Article doesn't say how much these students invest. So many commenters freaking out here but we don't know if these students invested $100 or $5000.

Why can't you go get it/get someone to tell you how much is on it?
