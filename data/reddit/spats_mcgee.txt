And just for the sake of providing a rejoinder to that argument, encryption technology in general is much more about "moving the goalposts" than providing "perfect" privacy that can't ever, ever be bypassed. A skilled ninja could hang out outside your window, or install cameras in your apartment to record your password. Or yes, someone could just tie you to a chair and whack you until you give them the password.
But the point is, "they", i.e., States, *can't do this to everyone.* In fact, given the harshness of these techniques and the generally high cost to implement them, they are impractical for all but a small set of targeted individuals. And the small effort required to make our communications more secure (end-to-end encryption, etc) creates an exponentially greater amount of effort on the part of States to interdict.

I wish he would have been more specific about the functions that banks provide that "add value." Banks provide a number of different "services", which (IMHO) can be subdivided into different areas:
1. They allow people to securely store &amp; retrieve their money at ATM's and such (this probably accounts for 99+% of bank use by consumers).
2. They own the rails of international finance &amp; act as "toll collectors."
3. They provide liquidity for loans.
?? What else? Because I'm seeing 2 functions that can be directly replaced by bitcoin in some capacity over the next 5-10 years. And furthermore, losing depositor funds means that the 3rd function is severely impaired.
So why exactly is it that we either want or need to keep banks around?

There are still a lot of people on this sub making that argument. I think that a big part of "maturing" as a libertarian is first understanding that the government does some really bad stuff (war on drugs, surveillance, torture etc), *but then* the realization that they're not omnipotent. The State's resources, competencies, and the social context in which it operates all serve as practical brakes on its capabilities.

Of course the obvious rebuttal to the argument is the energy use required to build &amp; fill bank buildings full of staff for compliance, regulatory, auditing &amp; etc purposes, which the blockchain effectively replaces.
But the more interesting point here is that bitcoin mining, more than perhaps any other industry, will directly gravitate towards regions where energy costs are low, whether that energy is clean or dirty. The fact that it is predominantly happening in China now has a lot to do with government subsidies that artificially depress the price of dirty, coal-fired  power plant energy.

I'll always have massive respect for the people willing to take the huge risk necessary in order to create a mining operation of sufficient scale to ROI+.
"Buy and hodl" is easy... We can all be reasonably certain (or not) that bitcoin will be a big deal *sometime* in the future. But to be able to weigh all the massive uncertainties around difficulty changes, hardware depreciation, power costs, facility costs, &amp; etc, and be able to say "let's pull the trigger".... That takes some brass balls.
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:28:10
Not to pile on the circlejerk here, but this notion that somehow the lack of a good end-user experience is what's holding back mainstream bitcoin adoption is hogwash.
Anyone who wants to try bitcoin can download any number of reasonably safe wallets for either iOS or Android and be set up for sending &amp; receiving bitcoin. No, they don't need to run a full node, or understand multisig, or even understand cold storage to get started with small amounts.

IDK, I think cause and effect might be confused here. There would be no "decentralized fear that they will have the authority" if there was explicitly no authority in the first place.
This is really an argument for the rule of law, i.e. if you're *going* to have a centralized authority that regulates the financial markets, it needs to operate along very rigid and narrowly prescribed guidelines, with all individual participants clearly stating potential conflict of interests.

If there is increasing demand that is not being satisfied, then it creates incentive for additional suppliers to enter the market. Thus it's in nVidia's best interests to satisfy the market, or a competitor will.

They aren't easily separable. Without a native token, a blockchain is just an incredibly inefficient database.
@_date: 2016-04-18 22:11:41
Good way of looking it. Private "blockchains" are technically possible to implement in way that is somewhat distinct from a simple database, but the only realistic use case is in the formation of these multi-institution consortia. Even then, all of these institutions will presumably have reciprocal legally-enforceable agreements, which reduces the use case even more.
So I guess it's technically possible, but very hard for me to view as "disruptive" in any meaningful sense.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:22:12
No nothing is guaranteed ever, this is just a chain of very strong incentives. The "price gouging" only exists because of lack of supply. This means that nVidia (and other potential competitors) are essentially leaving money on the table by not supplying this market. Thus, they will need to up their production levels to meet the demand.
Higher production levels means a larger market, which creates a greater incentive to reduce costs, which leads to better technology.

It's important to define what's meant by a "bubble." What would confirm that it is indeed a bubble? There's a price crash that goes back to ~ $8000-$9000, still up 900% over the year? Bitcoin's almost ended every year since 2012 with some multiplier, 2x-10x where it was the previous year. And it's also *crashed* a ton of times during that period as well, but always seems to recover.
I think the skepticism of the bubble label is that bubbles usually go "pop" when they're under even moderate stress. Bitcoin has had multiple major shocks to its system, and yet never seems to lose value below ~2-10x where it was the previous year. Bubbles "pop" once and you don't hear from them again.

From an Austrian economic perspective, debt itself is not necessarily a bad thing, it's more central banking institutions that artificially decrease the price of lending.

This is really it. There are no heroes here.

His story is that of Walter White basically. He's *not* someone with whom we should sympathize.
On the other hand, even with the gross judicial malfeasance and prosecutorial at play during Ulbricht's trial, it's sort of amazing that they were able to lock him up at all given the massive corruption on the part of law enforcement.

You're right in a sense, but this illustrates a subtle yet disruptive aspect of bitcoin: it can serve as a "third party" between currency pairs to allow for significantly more effective arbitrage between them.
We hear similar stories of purse.io bitcoin buyers being from developing countries where they do Amazon Mechanical Turk work for Amazon credits. If they want to trade for a more liquid currency, they first exchange into bitcoin then into whatever else (local currency etc). Despite the fact that they're paying a premium for their bitcoins, having a global market to sell them is still better than trying to sell their Amazon credits locally.
Perhaps this is how we get to the Moon; not by being the currency you use to buy a cup of coffee, but as the global *lingua france* for various illiquid digital tokens.

The best case for "private blockchains" that I've heard essentially argues that there is some sort of "dial" that can be semi-continuously tuned between a fully privatized, centralized database structure and the open, decentralized protocol of bitcoin. Think of some kind of federated n-of-m system that would have to sign off on "mining."
I'm still not completely convinced that this is a meaningful &amp; novel enough technical distinction to be worthy of discussion on the TechCrunch couch. What it really sounds like is happening here is that banks are balking at the fact most of the hashing power exists in China and/or "parts unknown" around the world, and therefore should they adopt bitcoin, aspects of "their" technical stack would be outside of their legal control.
Of course this is kind of a ridiculous argument if you compare BTC to gold... No one party owns all the gold miners, nor controls in any meaningful way gold distribution, sales &amp; trade on a global basis. It's a commodity. Yet despite this opacity I'm sure banks have no problem owning or trading gold or a variety of other commodities.

And finally, I have a big problem with your recent interview with the CoinSpark guy. This seems (or is it?) to be a competing protocol with OpenAssets, the latter being hinted to be what NASDAQ will use. The fact that OpenAssets wasn't mentioned once, at least to do some kind of pro/con comparison, was a big oversight. Unless I'm totally off-base here, these are competing standards for colored coin implementation, and the jury is definitely still out on which one is "optimal."

Social conservatism in the context of the Pauls is a little different than social conservatism when it comes to the broader conservative movement. For the Lindsey Grahams or Mitch McConnels of the Senate, social conservatism manifests as an *active* restriction of liberty, specifically in regards to the drug war. For Paul the "social conservatism" to which is referring, specifically abortion and gay marriage, take the form of a *passive* stance wState's rights, specifically that the Federal government should not be involved in either of these issues to begin with. 
I don't like the overly broad brush by which the term "social conservatism" is used to tar &amp; feather anyone who doesn't support modern "Great Society" big-government progressivism on every issue.

In the absence of either (a) large regulatory burden or (b) large inherent barrier to entry, any competitor could enter the market and undercut the "monopoly" if and when they decide to raise prices.

"Private block chains" don't offer anything to the consumer that Google Wallet can't. At best we're talking about an incremental advancement to existing database tech. At worst it's entirely vaporware.

Even if they did, I don't see how it would help. These companies allow merchants to receive USD in their bank account at the end of the day after customers give them BTC. But the problem is that nobody wants to give these businesses bank accounts in the first place! This is the reason why most of the legal marijuana business in CO is cash-only, and have to take huge security risks to store and transport large amounts of cash.
What needs to happen here is a robust cash &lt;----&gt; bitcoin trade. Marijuana sellers would then be able to offer discounts on sales based on the relative ease of securing &amp; transporting bitcoin vs bags full of cash.

Same question with bitcoin.
Once it's "popular enough," that means it has (let's say) X million users. How do you incentivize all, or even a sizable majority of them, to move to your closed-source monetize-able platform? Keep in mind that this is *after* significant network effects have set in, and there's nothing stopping an open-source fork from continuing on?
That's like saying "internet's great, but they're just going to put out a closed-source version of it and we'll all be using AOL again in 5 years." Doesn't work that way.

In all seriousness, you da real MVP, keep up the awesome work! The level of technical discussion on LTB is really amazing, and rivals anything else out there in the tech press. I listen to the a16z podcast (from Andreessen Horrowitz), and while they're really good at discussing issues that matter to your "typical" VC (cloud computing, gaming, etc), their bitcoin discussion was fairly thin and superficial compared with what you guys put out on a regular basis. Same goes for "TCBTC," TechCrunch's recently added bitcoin podcast. So the good news is that you guys have a *big* lead on the competition.
The bad news is that it that your lead can slip away if the topic drifts too much. Of course the show would be boring if all you ever talked about was wallet software &amp; mining hardware. But the danger is that *you* guys get bored with a technology for which *we've* all seen the potential, but the world has yet to wake up to. So you're going to have to spend some time talking about some pedestrian stuff like adoption metrics, increased use of multisig, and etc, because that's what people are going to want to hear about in a bitcoin podcast... Not magic mushrooms ;)
Maybe the ideal balance is some sort of split in each episode between the pedestrian stuff, like new wallets, new exchanges, price, etc, and "far out" stuff, like bitcoin 3.0 or whatever...

This is precisely how *not* to fund scientific research, and how to produce bad outcomes from both the perspective of the investor and the scientist.
The purpose of science is to produce knowledge by the application of the scientific method. The investor should fund science because the knowledge that is derived from such a process is useful to him/her for whatever reason. (Yes I realize that by and large private entities don't fund science anymore in this country, but that wasn't always the case, and hopefully won't always be the case in the future). So in your example, the investor should want to know whether elephants land on their feet because subsequent investment decisions (let's say, elephant-drop-proof buildings or whatever) are dependent on that knowledge.
If on the other hand the investor simply decides at the outset that "Yes they do!" and then hires a bunch of scientists with the implicit or explicit mandate to prove that point, they will get *bad information* that will subsequently produce *bad investment decisions.* In addition, the reputation of the scientists as objective seekers of knowledge is sullied in the process, so really nobody wins.

I am 100% on board with the notion that this trial was pretty much FUBAR. Prosecutorial shenanigans abounded, especially to exclude the very real corruption of Force &amp; Friends, which should have seriously changed the dynamics here.
But we have to on some level separate the legal procedural from the ethical aspects of this. Based on the best evidence available, i.e. the chat logs, Ulbricht as DPR committed some pretty heinous acts. While the evidence being fully presented &amp; vetted in court would certainly give it a higher standard of credibility, that doesn't mean that we can just conclude it's all made up. And Occam's razor dictates that we have to conclude the simplest possible explanation: that he did it.
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the claim that the Ulbricht journals were all a plant is pretty damn extraordinary, IMHO.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:48:17
Read what? He was caught in the SF public library with his computer open logged into Silk Road as DPR. That same computer had personal diaries and chat logs detailing his various murder-for-hire schemes. Unless you're going to tell me that the whole thing was faked, then yes, he pushed "the button" to have people tortured and killed. That makes him a cold-blooded murderer.
Nobody in the whole "Free Ross" movement has made any serious attempt to dismiss this evidence, all we get is "well he wasn't charged with it." Who cares? Unless we see something that seriously undermines it (and Force's corruption isn't enough), the evidence stands as far as I'm concerned.

But I agree with you if the argument is "drugs are bad mmkay, so let's lock him up!", which unfortunately you still hear around this sub.

I could agree with this if we're talking about fossil fuels, which we probably all agree result in the net heating of the earth. 
However, if we're talking about renewables, it's a different story. Solar energy is going to heat up the planet either way, photovoltaic panels simply convert some of that energy into a form we can use. Same thing for hydro, or tidal, or whatever.

Many VC's, including [at least one at Andreesen's own firm]( hold views that could only be described as anarcho-capitalist (sometimes disparaged as "techno-libertarian" by valleywag types).
The only thing that separates them from the Silk Road is merely the fact that they do not wish to operate openly illegal businesses. Thus, clarity of regulation for them is important so that they might invest further in the space. My point is that I don't see this as necessarily incompatible with the radical libertarian ideals of bitcoin; nobody's proposing watering down or changing the protocol, so most of their (VC's) activity is confined to the BTC/fiat interface. Whatever they do in this space, by investing in the institutional infrastructure, will be a net positive for the rest of us IMHO.

This is not the problem from bitcoin miners, it's the problem of rural municipalities who have artificially subsidized power and/or made deals with external power companies that leave their own citizens vulnerable to increased rates.
If we are to accept the notion of these awkward hybrid "public/private" entities responsible for pricing electrical energy, we're going to have to accept the notion that as society changes and new industries such as bitcoin mining are introduced, economic distortions are inevitable. This is *primarily* the fault of an antiquated, centralized government-controlled market that can't adapt to changing circumstances, *not* bitcoin miners.

Out of the *many* management lessons to be learned from Gox's flameout, this is an important one: delegate, delegate, delegate. Don't try to do everything on your own. The head of any company should be setting priorities and goals and then finding the appropriate resources (human or otherwise) needed to achieve those goals.
Not to say there aren't times when you need to roll your sleeves up and get things done on your own, especially in a small company. But Karpeles had all the hallmarks of a fair-to-middlin' coder who was thrust into a CEO role he either wasn't ready or wasn't willing to embrace.

This scenario doesn't make sense if you think it through. Bitcoin exists and functions precisely because it's decentralized, and its issuance follows set mathematical rules. Thus miners can make a known profit. If miners can't profit, then proof of work is not performed, transactions aren't verified, and the whole network falls apart.
What incentive would miners have to mine "US-Gov-Coin"? Would new dollars be issued? Somehow I don't think that central banks would be comfortable giving up this function. And if there is no decentralized network of miners, then we're back to our standard fiat currency and bitcoin maintains its relevance.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:13:48
Bitpay/Coinbase presumably have to advertise and market their services, correct? So they're paying someone or some group of people to do that currently. So why not "outsource" that task to people "out in the wild," who presumably have a greater knowledge of their own local community businesses?
IMHO the only important thing about fees is that they're significantly below Visa/MC, which is where they will likely remain, affiliate program or no. It's a simple market process... If users (merchants in this case) think they fees are too high, they'll use another service.

Well, these complaints are not without warrant.. Like with any insurance, fraud is the main problem to deal with. But this just boils down to the ability to verify real-world facts in a trustworthy manner. I think it's a solvable problem. You already see some pretty innovative approaches to that in projects like [TruthCoin]( and [Reality Keys](
The difficulty is that the aforementioned projects relay on public information databases, whereas for facts related to insurance, i.e. I'm a 25 year old male with no prior traffic accidents, you need someone to look at *your* particular situation and sign off on it. Again, I still think that trustworthy arbiters can be used to sign off on these things.
The more I think about, once these problems are solved, the really interesting parts of this concept come in with playing around with risk models. Since it's open source software, you can have a number of different insurance DAC risk models, some very conservative in terms of risk, others being very liberal. The DAC might even be able to "sell shares" of itself so as to incentivize the removal of whatever hazard it is insuring against.

No, you create value by buying bitcoin, which thereby increases demand for bitcoin. This increases its price, which incentivizes miners to secure the network. More miners securing the network adds value.


Well, this is a bit of a zero-sum picture, but I guess this is correct in the context in which you're presenting it.


So OK, let's say bitcoin goes to $100k. And "society" is pissed off at everyone who holds BTC. Too bad: *I'm* not going to switch. And neither would anyone else who holds BTC. So what's going to make us change? Who's going to be "adopting" this new "coin"?

This is not a view that's supported by the facts that are presented in the This American Life episode...

If this is actually the Planet Money podcast, they present a very different version of events related to the locating of Ulbricht than what is declared in the indictment. PM seems to imply that they first somehow located his server, and traced Ulbricht's computer to the SF public library by that method. The version that I'm familiar with is where he was found out because of his early forum posts using his real email, in addition to the fake ID's from Canada. So there's something up with their reporting, methinks.
Also, the segment closes with (and I'm paraphrasing) "whoops so much for your utopian libertarian free-for-all, kthnxbye," which is *highly* premature given OpenBazaar on the horizon.

To me, the point of a paper or other cold storage solution is that you trade digital security for physical security. Therefore, the BIP38 option, while nice to have, is not the core of the security that the paper wallet offers. The security of the paper wallet comes from the fact that the data has (hopefully) never touched the open internet, thus reducing the potential attackers from large number M (every hacker on the internet) to small number N (ninjas who can break into your apartment/bank/whatever). 
Thus, the point of the BIP38 wallet in my mind is just to prevent/delay a thief long enough for you to get to a backup copy and sweep the funds. Even a super-simple password (your birthday, etc) might be sufficient for this, as your common burglar would have to spend a long time before finding access to (a) someone who even understands what BTC is in the first place, and (b) someone with a dictionary to attack the BIP38 password.
TL;DR: Your birthday or something super-simple is probably good enough for BIP38 IMHO, since the data isn't on the internet to begin with

Well, the importance of these decentralized exchanges will come into focus once the Benjamin Lawsky's of the world decide that the centralized bitcoin exchanges need to be regulated out of existence. For instance, they say "exchanges can't handle any coins that have gone through a mixing service", thereby sharply reducing the liquidity of the exchanges, and then their demise.

I don't know if the analogy is entirely appropriate... Many of the proposals relating to crypto-stocks, such as what's being discussed by Patrick Byrne, propose using crypto-currency tokens and representing "real", legally-defined securities in a company. Therefore, the permission of the existing regulatory/legal system is essential so that in a court of law, your "magic internet money"-based token would be sufficient to establish your ownership of said security, without some dead tree stock certificate.
On the other hand, bitcoin establishes a parallel system that, like honey badger, "don't care" what legal or regulatory environment exists around it.
What would be *truly* radical would be crypto-stocks that actually allow for some kind of "voting rights" over the use of company (crypto)assets. This would create a system that was truly independent of the existing regulatory structure.

True, I guess the question is whether bitcoin will be more like Linux or more like Twitter... I.e., whether it's some back-end infrastructure technology or something that end-users interact with.
Personally, I've been moving more to the latter camp... the "virality" of ChangeTip and the Microsoft (i.e. X-Box) adoption say to me that when bitcoin explodes, it start from a million microtransactions passed around the globe and work their way up. Once more people figure out that they can (basically) send money through Twitter, that'll be a huge shot in the arm.

You're right, that is the question. Perhaps a little outside the scope of r/bitcoin, but it is important to think about.


You cast a negative light on ownership here that I don't know if I can get behind. Don't we own ourselves? What's the problem with that? And if we can own ourselves, why can't we own things? And finally, why does ownership of things give us an "advantage" over others? Conversely, if I own a bunch of stuff, I have obligations to protect that stuff, which means I require to an even greater extent on some system (whether it's government or non-government actors) to protect and/or maintain that stuff.


I don't think I can get behind that. Violence happens for all kinds of reasons. Personally, I go for a more neurological/psychological explanation: people do violent things because generally they had violent things done to them at some point, and their traumatized brains are re-expressing that. The desire for wealth and "stuff" requires parts of the brain, rational calculation and reward centers, that just aren't firing when someone's beating down someone else. Of course there are genuinely sociopathic people, but I'm leaving them out of the discussion of garden variety "violence," 99% of which I believe starts "at home" so to speak.


You're right, this is a dismal view, unrealistically so in my opinion. We group together in societies because it's more economically viable to do so. We interact and "trade", both from an economic and cultural perspective, because it is *profitable* to do so, whether monetarily or emotionally. It's not a zero-sum game; both parties benefit. I sell you shoes, I get money (and hopefully profit) and you get shoes. I go to a party, gathering, church, etc and contribute my voice, and the whole group is better for it. All of us come out on top. There's no "empathy" necessary in order for a market society to function (which is not to say that empathy would be absent; i think history has shown that the wealthiest societies are the most charitable).


OK I don't want to oversimplify here but I think you're going in the direction of equating, or at least equalizing, the power of market actors and governments. This relies on individuals or groups controlling, in a monopoly sense, some resource. I find most of these scenarios unrealistic in a true market economy, and I would challenge anyone to find instances of successful, long-term stable market monopolies that happened *without* state power intervening. 


"Necessity" is the mother of invention, and of entrepreneurship. The greater a monopoly "squeezes", the greater the incentive are for people are to seek alternatives. Then entrepreneurs start coming in and undercutting the monopoly. You see this with Taxis vs Uber/Lyft now. The only recourse the monopoly has is to go back to government.
I would posit that monopolies simply aren't sustainable without government. All of game theory is against them continuing to exist.

There's no "transfer." It's not like there's some office somewhere where someone decides, "OK now bitcoin is going to go to $10k." If bitcoin goes to $10k, it's because the market says so and there's not a *damn thing* that you or I or "society" can do about it.

Yeah this is the general strategy of "coinifying" something: correlate coin issuance to the positive behavior that you want to incentivize, and then make that coin tradeable for perks or benefits. Or, you could simply make the "network" (in the broadest possible terms) accessible only to those with the coin.
This is kinda like what the Let's Talk Bitcoin folks are doing with their LTB coin, although in that case the issuance and trade-in of the coin are controlled by human beings, as opposed to TorCoin which has to be purely by "machine" in order to preserve anonymity. But the basic incentive structure I describe above is similar.

I don't think you're misinterpreting here. You're correct to say that only small amounts of BTC are used for the operation of this and other "colored-coin"-type systems running on top of the blockchain. However, I still see this as increasing the value of bitcoin as a money for the main reason that the types of transactions that you're likely to see with Counterparty, i.e. escrows, bets, contracts, &amp; etc, will probably be denominated in bitcoin by "default."
Sure, you could design something to the effect of "pay off $40 in some bitcoin-denominated 2ndary token if the knicks win the playoffs," but you're complicating the process a lot more than structuring the bet as "pay 0.040 BTC..."

Agreed. RE your mining discussion, as I posted over in I've been starting to wonder if the large increases in hashing power that we've been seeing are due to progressive steps of "catching up" to modern semiconductor fab methods. Stated another way, in ~ 2013-2014, ASIC manufacturers didn't just jump to state-of-the-art; they only went as far as need by to be competitive with other manufacturers.
But now (according to my hypothesis), they've basically "caught up" with Moore's law, and since Bitmain, Spondoolie &amp; co aren't hiring any physics PhD's, they can't do any better than what Intel gives them. So what we hit was an inflection point in mining power; the drop in difficulty that we're seeing is all the miners who paid too much for last generation's technology and can't even hope to profit.
We might finally be getting to the point where what matters most is not who's got the best hardware, because everyone will basically have the same thing (unless they start hiring physics PhDs), but who has access to the cheapest power. And that's a whole different paradigm.

My guess is that adoption of BTC for in-game or gaming platform purchases will be one of the biggest drivers of adoption (c.f. this week's Microsoft news). Gaming presents a unique market for BTC adoption for three reasons:
1. Multiplayer gaming today is highly international, thus the adoption of a single borderless payment system makes much more sense than the painstaking work of developing a bunch of separate systems for each country of interest.
2. Seamless handling of micropayments is essential, something bitcoin does better than probably most alternatives.
3. Finally, the gaming demographic includes a significant chunk of young people who either don't yet have (or can't get access to) bank accounts or credit cards.
Considering the massive ($billions+) market for video games, there is significant value for BTC to capture here with increasing adoption. I'm increasingly thinking that it's the kids with headsets, not the bankers, who will take BTC to the Moon.

Well, from "locavores" to 3D printing, we might be seeing some kind of push in the opposite direction, that is towards more decentralized/local/"just-in-time" method of production. I admit it's unclear how far such movements / ideas will go in the future, but on the other hand I think it's a bit of an oversimplification to say "we've arrived at mass-market economies of scale, and we're never going back."
Especially if there's any kind of shock to the system, e.g. energy price spikes, decentralized forms of production might get a major boost.

I'd disagree with that. Gambling (i.e. of roulette or dice-type games) is supposed to be a pure game of chance, and none of the participants can have any inkling of whether the ball will land on red or black. However, with prediction markets there is some supposition that those with closer-to-insider or specialized knowledge are betting. Thus, information about the probability of predicted events is depicted in the share price.
EDIT: I'm not sure about the legal definition of gambling vis a vis Intrade, but in my book at least it's hard to equate prediction of real world events with straight-up "gambling" for the reasons I mentioned.

The question also arises as what would stock ownership actually entail? Would the crypto-stock actually allow some sort of voting right at shareholder meetings? If so, would it then effectively dilute the remaining "legacy" stockholder's equity? I imagine if the crypto-stock offers any of the benefits of traditional stock ownership, i.e. equity and/or receipt of dividends, the SEC might very well have some objections.
EDIT: I'm as anarchist as the next guy on r/bitcoin so I don't believe that the SEC has any *legitimate* objections in a moral sense, but on a practical level, given that Overstock has offices and warehouses and addresses they kinda have to play ball with the guys in DC...

Want a challenge? A decentralized insurance pool. Many pieces of the puzzle aren't quite here yet, but primarily I see this as a DAC-type system that would have the following functional properties:
1. Take in user premiums and issue colored coins as proof of coverage. This goes as follows:
a. User submits cryptographically signed demographic information to the DAC (i.e. user is 25-year old male with no auto accidents, etc). Signing authorities would have to be verified by the DAC as being trustworthy.
b. DAC then issues colored coin token denoting coverage over set period of time in exchange for premium provided by user.
2. When claims occur, users submit colored coin token indicating proof of insurance to the DAC, along with cryptographically signed statement of accident. DAC must verify claim as above, presumably by trustworthiness of signing authority. DAC then issues payment to user.
The "brain" of the DAC would be an actuarial database, from which it would draw risk data in order to determine the premium to charge users.
The real beauty of this is that (a) it could essentially replace the insurance industry as we know it, (b) it would be totally transparent (open source software), (c) it would be incapable of being stingy or slow about claims, and (d) in more advanced forms it could rapidly adjust its risk models to adapt to changing world events.
So yeah, go build that. ;)
EDIT: yes I realize many things are missing here. In many cases, you need "signing authorities" to say that yes, you did break your leg. But for things like crop or earthquake insurance you could presumably just use public data feeds. Nonetheless I think it would be interesting to design this as a sort of "pseudo-code" experiment to see how it would work. Presumably you'd build something like this on top of the Ethereum platform.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:19:33
You're missing the point. A contract is an agreement between two or more individuals for the provision of something in exchange for something else.

Therefore you no longer need the State, you no longer need lawyers, just a good coder.

So where is the actual corruption taking place? Just like the discussion elsewhere on this thread RE prohibition, corruption arises because the government forces ordinary people to get some kind of special permit or license to do something they need to do to survive, whether it's start a business, maintain a property claim or just drive down the street without police harassment. Thus the "gatekeepers" of those privileges gain special powers over their fellow men, in such a way that they profit much more by taking advantage of their position than "playing by the rules," which are probably poorly designed in the first place.

@_date: 2014-04-11 17:30:15
This is true. I'd love to hear discussions about bitcoin go deeper into the debate of fiat money vs. deflationary currency. However, the problem is that when deflation is brought up wbitcoin, it's frequently as a "gotcha" shut-down of discussion (c.f. the MIT professor in Technology Review); as if they found a loose bolt in the space shuttle that dooms the whole thing to failure as soon as it launches.
Maybe it's just so much "crazy Austrian talk," but I don't think that economic history is nearly so clear on the point of whether deflationary currencies could work to sustain our modern economy, and conversely whether our (historically brief) experiment with the "scientific" management of the money supply has helped real economic growth. Yet the deflation "problem" keeps getting raised, as if we all just forgot that 2+2 = 4.

Every new technology follows an exponential adoption curve, as in fact has the entire history of technological progress thus far. Everything is accelerating. You can pick and choose individual predictions that failed to pan out, but that doesn't change the basic fact that "change" is happening faster and faster.
Bitcoin as a technology is on the same exponential adoption curve. This will inevitable place it on a collision course with world governments for all the reasons I outlined.


If bitcoin really starts to take off, then the dollar will start to become significantly devalued. If this trend continues, given the deflationary nature of BTC, governments will find it increasingly difficult to fund their activities. They're not going to *like* this.
You can describe a scenario (again, like "Paypal-lite") where bitcoin reaches a certain market cap and just levels off nicely. I don't find this scenario realistic personally. It's either "to the moon" or crash land... And the former option leads to quite a few problems for our government.

But it's not just an issue of size, it's an issue of centralization, and an inherent aspect of the payment system. See upthread; it's significantly more difficult to extract 1000 private keys from 1000 individuals (with varying operating systems, levels of security awareness etc) than it is to extract a *single* private key that controls some aspect of UPS's payment system, which might net you access to 1000 credit card numbers. Which strategy will hackers employ?


This is just wrong. What about all of the money that credit card companies have to pay for fraud protection?

What I am responding to is the assumption that "power" is some sort of ethereal substance that floats back and forth between governments and the wealthy / corporate entities, and will inevitably be held by one or the other. My point is that the power held by governments, as manifested by the example of the policeman, is *qualitatively* different from the power held by individuals and other non-governmental actors.
It is the fact that at the end of the day, it is the *government* that wields the power to destroy any of us should we not comply with its rules, whether you think those rules are just or not. Can the government be co-opted? Sure, big banks, big businesses etc do it all the time. Does this change the fact that it is the *government* that hires the soldiers and orders the trigger to be pulled? Absolutely not. That is why I say that whatever power government holds in society, it is fundamentally and qualitatively different from the "power" held by the richest man in the world.

I think that answers directly referencing mining miss the point somewhat. Why does bitcoin have value? In my opinion, its value comes from the novel aspects of its technology. These are:

2. A secure, decentralized digital ledger system.
These are core aspects of "why is this thing valuable" IMHO.

I don't think that Western Union actually owns these places, it seems like they're locally owned. Which means that if a method of money transfer can be discovered that bypasses Western Union or other legacy money transmitters, they will jump onto it. Mexico would be a huge market for this. The consumer doesn't even need to see the BTC (unless they want to), as long as you have robust exchange on either end, you can just do cash in ---&gt; cash out.
Are you taking a strategy that approaches these end-users?
EDIT: Tl;dr: Target the mom and pop currency exchanges that dot the map. They have the strongest incentive to switch.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:49:57
Right. So Kraken or 2nd market for large-scale buyers, and Coinbase for mom &amp; pop, like I said. And of course, once the merchant economy (e.g. Overstock) starts taking off, the need for exchanges becomes even less.

I think it goes against the inherently democratic nature of the way Reddit deals with upvotes and downvotes to say that we should ban this or that *type* of content, even if it's on-topic. In my mind, the only requirement that r/bitcoin should have is that all posts should be about bitcoin. If you think that more intellectual posts should be at the top, all you can do is upvote them. If the community as a whole wants memes, memes are what they'll get.
Sorry, but I think this is just something inherent to a democracy... You don't get to decide what content should or shouldn't be accepted as "the best" or "most important." Especially here in bitcoin, where symbols and visual media *are* especially important (c.f., the top banner).

Sure... In order to really get into the details of this, you have to borrow concepts from anarcho-capitalism such as "polycentric law." In particular, the mechanism by which blockchain-based systems will create something resembling "law" might have more to do with insurance contracts of today.
As I see it you would participate in a decentralized insurance pool powered by blockchain technology that would both protect you from bad actors (by repaying you in the event of harm) and dis-incentivizing bad actors in the first place by raising the premiums (or simply booting out) pool members who participate in such actions. For actions that occurred from members outside of the pool, the system could even be programmed to automatically generate "bounties" for the collection of monies owed to the aggrieved parties.
Now imagine a future in which there's no government: All property is private, and property owners would likely require participation in some form of the aforementioned insurance system in order to allow access.

So who invested in them before they had revenue? What was their valuation at that point? Plenty of tech companies are valued in the $billions before they even have revenue. It's called "tech" because it's the technology (and its potential) that has value, not whether at this particular moment the company is revenue-positive.
And if you insist, the "product" here is a secure, decentralized digital ledger, as I mentioned before. When you buy bitcoins you are buying "shares" (in a manner of speaking) in this technology. You are effectively paying the miners for this service by creating a demand for the token that pays them.

This is another refrain of the "see, credit card fraud isn't such a big deal" line that we're hearing again and again in this thread.

It's interesting to speculate on how this might affect the price... Is BTC treated as "just another investment" by folks, in which case losses in emerging markets might cause them to cash out BTC to make up for their losses? This would push the price down.
On the other hand, those actually *in* these emerging economies might flock to BTC as a safety valve, a la Cyprus back in April '13, thus pushing the price up. I wonder which factor would win out...

Fair enough. As bitcoin is such a multifaceted technology with a wide variety of applications, it's hard to guess what sort of "killer" application will emerge first.

Yes, this line of reasoning never appealed to me. It's the same as saying "oh yeah well BTC is such a tiny percentage of global commerce, so what's the big deal?" As bitcoin fans presumably we anticipate (and advocate for) a world in which crypto-currency is *the* primary form of money. And yes, in that world, it will also be *the* primary funding mode for all sorts of "illicit" activities.
In fact, we might reasonably guess that organizations like drug cartels will start adopting BTC *before* mass adoption in society occurs. I mean, why wouldn't they? Remember that only 1/2 of international drug trade is actual drugs, the other half is big stacks of cash being smuggled across borders. Once they realize that they can just send BTC, they're going to jump on that like flies on shit.
At that point, we're going to have to realize that the issues are bigger than just crypto-currency. We're going to have to start blaming the drug war itself for producing the monstrous violence south of the border, rather than what form of money they're using.

As someone skeptical of the "inflation is necessary" argument, I really have three questions:
1. Where should inflation be?
2. Who gets to decide what number that is?
3. How do they "know" what that number is?
We all agree that too much inflation is a bad thing. One could present arguments as well for too little inflation being a bad thing, although personally I don't buy the "deflationary spiral" scenario.
But the real issue here is the *pretense of knowledge*. With such a complex and multifaceted world economy, and all the trillions+ of variables that go into it, how can *any* single entity presume to know how much inflation an economy needs? And if they can know something this complex, why can't they just run the entire economy? Why can't they just tell us how many pigs, chickens or microprocessors we need to produce to satisfy "aggregate demand" for these things?

The "industrial use" of bitcoin is as a decentralized asset ledger. This, the cost of the miners securing your transaction, is the "intrinsic value" of a bitcoin. Like gold's few industrial uses, this is bitcoin's floor-value.
Incidentally, once colored coins starts getting further along development, the market will determine this floor value by finding the minimum amount of BTC to represent a colored coin token. This will correspond to the minimum amount of BTC necessary for miners to include it in the transactions.

My understanding is that they did something like a buffer overflow on the Captcha, which then produced some error like "Error Captcha v. XYZ running at (IP address) A.B.C.D."

Most of your arguments rest on the notion that armed conflict as a way of settling property disputes is economically viable in a state-less society. **This is not proven.** Armed conflict is messy and expensive for all parties involved, and is generally not "net" profitable. Groups which solved problems due to armed conflict, absent any kind of government to "back them up," would inevitably lose the resource race to groups that solved their problems through negotiation / other non-violent means. The non-violent, or purely "defensive" groups, would inevitably wind up with more resources in the long term than groups that decided to violate other people's property (i.e. "warlords"). This would happen if for no other reason than, compared to the variety of other business ventures that exist in a modern industrial society, *warlordism simply isn't profitable.*
Stated another way: Group A is a defensive collective, co-protection agreement, or other form of "mutual defense contract" made up of individuals working real jobs generating income. Group B is a warlord's gang. Group B has to expend a ton of resources, both human and monetary, to take over other people's property, who very likely have more advanced technology and resources to defend themselves. If you were an investor in "anarcho-utopia", which group would you invest in? Which group do you think has a better long-term profitability?

But that's exactly the point. The only regulations that are possible to apply to bitcoin are at the entry and exit points -- i.e. exchanges. An essential prerequisite of regulating remittances is the fact that the government knows whether money is staying in the U.S. or leaving the country. With bitcoin, they have no idea, thus they have no capability of regulating "bitcoin remittances" as a separate category from just bitcoin.
So put it more succinctly, the model would be person A buys bitcoin in the U.S., then transfers it person B in whatever country. At no point in this process is any business offering a money transmitter service, therefore money transmission laws don't apply (or at least are unenforceable).
EDIT: Sure, they could try to stamp out the exchanges... My point is just that bitcoin has the potential to make all of the financial infrastructure of moving money overseas obsolete. Bitcoin simply doesn't have to go through what WU had to go through to build their network, any more than cell phones have to build copper wire.

Thus, what we're really talking about is not so much the institutions of any government *per se*, but the authority that is imbued in them in the minds of their populace. At the end of the day this is the only thing that gives them power, because there are always more of "us" than there are of "them."  
The reason why people do what the policeman tells them and/or pay their taxes on time is a complex mixture of "he'll bonk me on the head if I don't do what he says" and "this is the way it's got to be for the good of everyone." Different societies fall at various points on this scale; asian societies for instance have much more of the latter, and the government is seen as simply a tool to create a harmonious society. The peoples of certain middle eastern nations ruled by strong despots might have more of the former attitude in their interactions with government.
What bitcoin and related technologies for allowing pseudonymous economic activity offer is the potential to take "bonk on the head" out of the equation completely... and see what remains.

So basically "we'll make them an offer they can't refuse." To me, what's most fascinating about what this stooge is saying is that he has to say it publicly at all. Make no mistake, this is a sign of desperation. The above quote succinctly illustrates the kind of "backdoor persuasion" that government agencies *used* to be able to apply to tech companies pre-Snowden. "Play ball, do what we want, would be a shame if something happened to that nice market cap of yours now wouldn't it?"
Now that the market sees encryption-by-default as a selling point, the government has an uphill battle on their hands to convince everyone that they should be OK with a *little* less freedom. If their strategy is trotting out thugs like this to make veiled threats to the American people, I think they're going to be on the losing end of this fight.

While I'm totally on board with how Byrne is pushing the envelope, isn't this proposal going to be D.O.A. with the SEC? All the middle-men and brokers in the financial system exist for a reason, and it's not strictly because a better technical solution doesn't yet exist for stock settlement; I would imagine it's because most of them sit as trolls across some bridge required by the regulatory process.
For instance, I would imagine that there's a law somewhere stating that your security offering must be listed on a registered exchange, be sold by registered brokers, etc etc. If an existing company were to just offer a "cryptosecurity" like this, wouldn't it be "illegal by default"?

Ah, but perhaps you're just seeing Government in its true light? What is any government except for a "bunch of individual actors who organize themselves into a gang"? Try not paying your taxes, and the friendliest government in the world will start looking pretty ugly in short order.


The anarcho-capitalist proposal is not that we would stop all aggression for all time. It's simply that we don't need these "gangs", whether you want to call them governments or not, to produce a society in which the maximum of prosperity provided by a market society is provided to the maximum number of people. The proposal, whether you agree with it or not, is that everything we think we need from government, police, roads, contract dispute resolution, etc can be provided for by market means. Then the things that *nobody* wants from government, i.e. global war, the drug war, police brutality etc will fade away not because we all join hands and sing "kumbaya" but because *nobody will be willing to pay for them.*
Bitcoin is just the beginning of that, a peaceful opting out of the government monetary system. But it's not the [end of the process]( by any means.

*On Decentralized Autonomous Corporations*
There's something that seems incomplete about DAC's, I was wondering if any smart CS-theory types around here might be able answer for me. The basic concept of a DAC as I understand it is a code-based entity that is capable of disbursing funds (e.g. bitcoin) based on certain criteria. The "DAC" aspect of bitcoin as I understand it is the fact that the source code disburses new bitcoins in return for mining/securing the network. Conversely, the miners act like "shareholders" of the corporation.
Other DAC's might do more complicated things. For instance, we would imagine a "crop insurance" DAC that takes in weather information and disburses funds from a pool of members when any one member is affected by an adverse weather event. This example is relatively straightforward because in it we are able to take a trusted data source like a national weather feed and map that onto well-defined payoff outcomes.
However, what if you don't have a trusted data source? For instance, let's imagine a health insurance DAC, it would have to have a way of verifying claims made by members of the pool and disbursing the funds accordingly.
So the basic question: Since DAC's are essentially bitcoin wallets connected to distributed software, there will be a large incentive to defraud/hack them. How can DAC's learn about real-world events in a manner which requires no or low trust?

Bitcoin, colored coins and other cryptocurrency-based systems can easily provide for credit and loans. I'm not arguing that concepts like "credit" and "loans" will end in a bitcoin world. I'm merely stating that centralized institutions to provide these things will no longer be necessary.


Credit existed before fractional reserve banking.

OK sure, it's pseudonymous, but it's still a hell of a lot more anonymous than any other form of value transfer over the internet. Look up a random transaction on blockchain.info, imagine you're the police. How do you even start trying to track down who make that transaction? Especially if TOR is involved?
Now compare that with a single call to a bank saying "I'm the police, tell me what I want to know." I'm not claiming that bitcoin is unbreakably anonymous, but it's a huge gulf away from what we have now.

It's a fundamental question for anyone in our society today: who do you trust more, institutions (banks, FDIC, credit card companies etc) or yourself?

They're happening now because of either immature technology or amateur-hour business and security practices (c.f. both in the case of Mt Gox), rather than anything inherent to technology itself. Compare to credit card payments, where an *inherent* part of the technology as it exists today is that all the information required to spend money against your account is sent with every transaction. And yes, they can potentially address this with European style smart-cards, but they haven't yet...


I don't see how the convenience of the transaction has any bearing on the security. In the scenario I described, bitcoin is both safer and more convenient, from the perspective of a sales transaction.

Everything you're talking about RE bitcoin security is something like growing pains, as best-practices are developed. In fact, paper wallet systems like Piper and Bitcard put bitcoin in the realm of physical security, which we as a society do fairly well. The point is that you can choose your own level of risk.

Colored coins = simpler, with fewer features, but perhaps less complicated to implement. Counterparty contains additional features that are probably not essential for Reddit's purposes IMHO. I'm not sure if I have all the technical details right, but here is my view of this:
Colored coins is really just putting some bit of information in the OP_RETURN of a bitcoin transaction to "color" that output. That's basically it. There really isn't any additional protocol layer on top of it, except that you have to have some consensus among users what the data in that output means. So in this case, Reddit would create a bunch of colored coin outputs corresponding to shares, and these could be traded around on the blockchain using normal bitcoin transactions that preserve the output characteristics.
Counterparty on the other hand encodes data into the addresses used in transactions (I believe), and has a bunch of additional stuff for contracts, decentralized exchange, asset type definition etc. Whether this stuff is necessary for the simple functionality of passing tokens around, I'm not sure. It seems to me like Colored Coins is the "minimum viable product" here....
EDIT: probably should have responded to one thread level up... oh well.

Oh, so now "people feel uncomfortable"? What "people"? Who? 
Certainly not the users or miners of bitcoin! As for myself, I'm pretty f'ing "comfortable" with the way things are right now when it comes to "attribution." For all the trolls in this sub, and all the complaints both valid and invalid, I don't see anyone here saying "gee I wish there was a way to be *less* anonymous with bitcoin!"
And here we see the proof that this dinosaur still just doesn't get it. Bitcoin is an open-source P2P technology, run *by* the users and *for* the users. Bill Gates and his "people" are mostly irrelevant to its success or failure.
You can either have (a) the decentralized ledger &amp; transaction network, or (b) a private token system that you can monetize and has all the traceability needed to satisfy your "people." You get to pick 1, not both.

Nobody is saying it's immune to hacking. But *as a method of payment,* it's simply *better,* all other things being equal, than a method of payment that requires the transmission of your full account data with every transaction. There really isn't a way around that fact. If all of those transactions were in bitcoin, this problem would not have happened.
Sure, there's wallet security, but that's an entirely different subject. We can talk about trezor, multisig, and any number of already existing or soon-to-be-existing solutions to address that problem. It's *solvable.* Centralizing large amounts of customer information presents an *inherent* security problem that distributed models do not have.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:04:43


Yes, but *someone* is paying those fees, so in order to gain competitive advantage merchants will start to offer discounts for paying with BTC at some point (some already are).


Well, can't buy things on the internet w/ cash. Plus, the fact that bitcoin isn't so useable "out of the box" is currently being remedied by better software / services.


That's debatable. Anti-bank sentiment is probably at an all time high in recent history. it's one of those "how will consumers behave in 5 years?" questions that only time will tell. Plus, services like Coinbase and Circle will effectively "be your bank" for bitcoin.


Multisig escrow -- No need to elaborate.


Well, one could argue that the only reason BTC has gotten to the market cap it's achieved is because of at least some level of distrust of our current system. Make no mistake, bitcoin is an "exit," and on some level will rise or fall based on overall sentiment of our monetary system. If you think that our current "system" of fiat money and too-big-to-fail is just fine, then perhaps BTC isn't for you.

I'll wait with popcorn to see how they "coopt" it. Any meaningful "cooption" on their part would mean that they create a centralized digital currency, which is qualitatively different from bitcoin, and will be perceived as such by the market.

Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger system independently of anything that Counterparty or Mastercoin do.

So what does it mean to "own" a bank account? Did the people of Cyprus "own" their bank accounts when the government decided they would be "bailed-in"?


You know, someone with a keylogger could potentially access your online bank account and wire xfer your money to Nigeria. And furthermore, nothing's stopping you from using a multisig address to prevent that from happening with bitcoin.


Then why are you here, discussing a stateless decentralized digital gold currency?

That's great for in person transactions. Try sending cash to another continent. Also, bitcoin transactions can be made immediate too with the appropriate counterparty risk (i.e. BitPay).


Wrong. Block time is targeted at ~ 10 min regardless of blockchain size.

I think you're framing the problem wrong. Corruption only occurs because the government has too much power, i.e. to issue licenses or permits that people need to form businesses or maintain property. Thus the "gatekeepers" of these pervasive government permits become targets of corruption. So in reality, corruption is a symptom of too much government, not too little.

Yes but at the point of sale, there is absolutely no risk of this happening. You're not sending your private key to the merchant. The risk is in the storage of BTC on your personal computer or whatever, which is a separate issue to simply comparing the merits of BTC vs CC's as a payment method.

Great article, but no mention of [smart contracts]( or [smart property]( To me, these two ideas are the core mechanisms by which the "digital anarchy" will come to pass.
Smart contracts will allow for complex multiparty agreements, e.g. "personal mutual defense treaties," decentralized insurance, polycentric law, etc that obviate the need for the State. Smart property will do for physical goods what bitcoin has done for money: make them significantly more difficult, if not impossible, to confiscate by aggressive governments.

Yeah, this... A "remittance service" for bitcoin is basically an exchange in the remote country. The "send money anywhere in the world" part is already built into the protocol.
Although, you might imagine that some company would try to position themselves as just like Western Union but cheaper fees, and handle the exchange on both ends in an over-the-counter manner such that the customer never even sees the BTC. I suppose we haven't seen that yet to my knowledge.

@_date: 2014-06-09 16:23:26
Well, the general argument against this kind of thing happening is that it might precipitate a sudden drop in the value of BTC. I would submit that a large part of bitcoin's value proposition is the fact that it isn't controlled by any one centralized entity (because otherwise, why wouldn't you just use Google Wallet or something similar). If someone begins to threaten that neutrality, then the market value of bitcoin takes a huge hit, and then *everyone*, miners and pool operators included, takes a bath.
So if the pool operators care about the value of the BTC they're mining, they will do their utmost to maintain at least the appearance of neutrality towards transactions. In actuality, it's the miners with their large capital investment in hardware who have the most to lose by a drop in BTC value. Therefore, the miners serve as a check on the integrity of the pool operators.
EDIT: What I'm really describing here is some scenario in which the pool operators, either openly or clandestinely, decide to double-spend or restrict transactions in some way. As Andreas said, this behavior would come to a rapid end, because of the market incentives that I cited above.

I'm proposing that it's almost 100% certain that when bitcoin takes off, it will become the preferred transaction medium for illicit activity. And when that happens, we need to start confronting the root causes of these "illicit" activities, like the war on drugs and the war on terror, rather than frame the discussion in terms of USD vs BTC.

FWIW the Austrian school would argue in the negative, more specifically that expansionary Federal Reserve policies, largely in response to the economic problems caused by WWI, precipitated the credit boom of the 20's and subsequent crash of the 1930's (edit: c.f. Murray Rothbard, America's Great Depression). The continued attempts to institute controlling economic policies, price controls etc engaged in by both the Hoover and Roosevelt (New Deal anyone?) only served to exacerbate the problem in this argument by not allowing for the liquidation of mal-investments.
These same Austrians would present essentially the same view of the current credit crisis, and that the malinvestments of the housing bubble (that now largely exist on the Fed's balance sheet) *still* have not actually been cleared, and wait to re-emerge another day, like the ghost confinement unit in Ghostbusters.

Libertarian here. Yes, quasi-monopolies exist in broadband right now. That being said, I have a hard time seeing the "nightmare scenarios" of net neutrality proponents coming to pass. Say comcast starts throttling your precious torrent traffic. People would find out, it would be a huge scandal, and users would switch to another provider (DSL or whatever).
You need collusion between cable and DSL providers, who are currently in fierce competition, in order for the these nightmare scenarios to come to pass. And even *if* that happens, some sort of decentralized mesh-net alternative would arise. Or gateways that scramble your bittorrent traffic. Or any number of other solutions.

I'm not sure what approach they're going to be using, but something like this would be much more effective with some kind of Chaumian e-cash token which is redeemable later for bitcoins.
An idea I had (and others it seems) was that every packet that got sent along a Tor circuit have along with it a small token that would be an e-cash key. Each token would be wrapped up in another layer of the onion, just like the data that was being passed through the network. Thus every node along the Tor circuit would unwrap its packet, collect its e-cash token and then send the data along to the next hop. 
You could use the existing architecture of Tor relay circuits and directory servers... The only difference would be that each node would advertise a "price per kb" or something like that. You would also need a "bank" to cash in the e-tokens for bitcoins.

Well "darwinism" is a bit of a dismissive way of referring to market competition. I'm not talking about the weak getting eaten by the strong here. I'm talking about frameworks of voluntary human (and machine) interactions that operate according to certain set rules. Bitcoin is a simple example, and decentralized autonomous organizations/corporations/societies are the "next gen." "Opt-in" societies. Google Balaji Srinivasan's YCombinator talk for more details. "May the best system win" is simply saying, "may the best framework for voluntary cooperation of humans work out at the end." It doesn't need to be the zero-sum game of "darwinism."


Yes and no. Most of us exist and spend our lives in basically voluntary societies; I choose where I want to live (within certain limits), I choose whom to work for (within certain limits), I choose who I associate with. Systems like bitcoin are important because they allow for forms of organization that are 100% voluntary, but also "strong" in the sense that they cannot be stopped by any government, *nor do they require* a government to enforce their rules.


They don't. But then again, is this something that we really need government for? If you look all the way from tribal societies to modern international megacorporations, private dispute resolution works. It works because the parties with a dispute have an incentive to solve things peacefully rather than with violence, which is *expensive*, unless.. you guessed it... you're a government and can push those costs off onto taxpayers.
Before bitcoin, you could say "yeah private dispute resolution OK, but who will enforce their ruling without government?" Now, smart contracts and the blockchain handle the enforcement. Brave new world. ;)

That sounds all well and good, but the arc of history is pointing in the opposite direction. We've gone from God Emperors to Monarchs to Constitutional Monarchs to Republics.

There's no reason why you can't have insurance to cover for these things. And most hospitals have emergency rooms that accept anyone regardless of ability to pay. Sure, this is required by law... But would they really shut their doors if it wasn't the case? *Was* this in fact the case before the laws were put in place? I'm not so sure about that.

No problem, and let me say thanks for the great discussion. Don't know if anyone on the main thread is still listening, but I don't care.
Also, FYI many of the arguments vis a vis stateless societies and private arbitration can be found in a tract called "Chaos Theory" available from economist Bob Murphy. For "further reading."


Depends on what we mean by "framework" here, but I think we're talking about law. And I'm not certain about your last point. In an anarcho-capitalist context in which all property is private property, there would be no "universal" law... And yet the crushing economic necessity to collaborate, to move around etc would almost immediately create something like a "common law" framework. This would occur if for no other reason than whomever tried to create excessive laws on their property, i.e. a mall for which no shorts or knee-length skirts were allowed, would lose customers rapidly to malls that were more permissive (up to a point) in their dress code.
So I guess I'm really not sure if we need a "single" moral and/or legal framework... And besides, if that were the case, wouldn't that argue for one world government / religion?




OK, since there's some confusion on how this might work, let me clarify: Say you and I wanted to transact, but were worried that the other party might renege on their end of the deal. So we create a 2-of-3 escrow transaction in bitcoin in which we specify a 3rd party whom we both trust to adjudicate in the event of a dispute. Now in the case that one of us refuses to sign the transaction (i.e. a dispute arises), the adjudicator's word is *final.* I say final because as soon as they sign the contract (or if they refuse to sign the contract), funds either move or don't. *That* is the enforcement to which I refer.
In *contrast*, the situation we have now is that even if you and I agree to 3rd party arbitration for our dispute, we still require governments to be the "enforcement" end of that bargain. That brings in additional costs (to us and society) of lawyers, police, etc. With smart contracts, the rules that we set up at the beginning of the transaction (which can be arbitrarily complex) are *final*. Finality removes uncertainty, which reduces risk, which in turn reduces cost. That's why this concept is so powerful.
RE Violence and government:
My point is not that violence is impossible without government, merely that government presents a highly *sub-optimal* solution to the problem of violence in society. In fact, it could perhaps be argued that governments throughout history have caused more violence than they have prevented, but this is a sticky hypothetical so we won't go there. And furthermore, I would reject the "evolutionary" argument for government: we've also had Herpes for quite a while, but I don't think anyone would complain if we got rid of it.
Perhaps my point condensed would be: We *think* we need governments for protection (of our persons, of our contracts, of our money etc), but do we really? Bitcoin perhaps shows that we don't need government for money... What else don't we need government for?

A lot of these points have already been resolved or discussed to some extent or other in various anarcho-capitalism forums, so the wiki might be good reading if you're interested in some context...
But if you start from a framework of property rights, then many of the solutions become clear. Polluting peoples' land and "beating people up" are clear violations of property rights, and it is likely in an anarcho-capitalist society that market means to deal with these problems would arise, for the simple fact that there is an overwhelming market desire to NOT live on polluted and NOT get beat up. People have an incentive to protect their own persons and property, thus markets would (and already do) emerge to provide this service.


Once it was said that you need a "central authority" for money, too. Bitcoin's more than just a digital currency; it shows us how to have strong property rights without government.

Well hey, culture is important. Frequently libertarians are accused of putting all blame at the feet of government, but not me. Whether a government (or warlord) stays in power or is toppled has much to do with its actions as what the culture will tolerate. It's an interplay.
The economics are also important... In places like Somalia, the sad fact is life is cheap. For someone with no hope of a future, why not join up with a warlord? As economic development and globalization spread across the world, people will be increasingly wary about risking their lives and property for someone else's war. Greed is good, in this case.


How is this *possibly* a sustainable business plan? Pretty soon you'll have every other protection agency in your neighborhood advertising services specifically to protect people from *you.*


You keep saying "monopolization" here to describe private protection agencies, but you're really stretching the meaning past its breaking point. How can a private protection agency, which needs to compete with other private protection agencies to earn paying customers, *possibly* be described as a "monopoly"?

I don't think it's inappropriate at all to talk about drugs in the context of OpenBazaar/DarkMarket. We can all be adults and realize that this *is* going to be the primary application, at least in the near-term, while at the same time understanding the *future* potential for these markets eclipses such a narrow scope.
Such technologies (including bitcoin) don't allow us to step away from certain moral issues and say "hey this is just a computer program, leave your politics out of it." Implicit in bitcoin is the idea that you should be able to send money to anyone, anywhere, without restriction. That *would* have been a radical libertarian proposition just a few years ago, but because of Satoshi it's now simply "the fact on the ground."
Likewise, implicit in the idea of OpenBazaar or any sort of bitcoin-based decentralized marketplace is that anyone, anywhere should have the ability to sell anything to anyone. We shouldn't back away from the implication that yes, this means drugs for *anyone* who can pay. The drug war has been a disastrous, deadly failure, and I say three cheers for any peaceful technological solution to end it.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:11:29
My take is that this points towards the future for bitcoin-accepting businesses: If it is indeed such a deal for them to accept bitcoin payments, they're going to need to start passing those savings onto consumers if they want to keep sales momentum. Gyft does this right: with their rewards program, it's effectively 3% cash back if you pay with bitcoin, which is competitive with the some of the best cash back credit cards. Eventually, the frictionless aspect of bitcoin *will* win out over the credit card infrastructure, I think there's a certain evolutionary certainty to that.
To disagree with the article a bit, there *is* a real value proposition to be made for consumer adoption of bitcoin: It *can be* smooth, quick, and much safer than a credit card. Think about it: see a QR code on a webpage (or in a brick and mortar store), whip out your smartphone with the blockchain app, snap a pic and click "send" and you're done. Future apps that utilize NFC-enabled smartphone could simplify this even further and make it a truly one-step process, no more fumbling with wallets and pieces of plastic. This is the vision of many ventures like Google Wallet, but they still have to "pay the troll" of the Visa/Mastercard cartel, which gives them an inherent handicap w.r.t. bitcoin.

I've found that in a lot of the "lost all my BTC stories" you can generally find at least one of the following factors: (A) For web wallets, two-factor authentication not properly set up or (B) installed shady/untested wallet/gaming/pirated software.

Well you can look up the "deflationary spiral" argument for reasons why deflation is bad. Personally I don't find it convincing (or with a historical precedent that makes sense), but there you go. IMHO, deflation always has its limits; if house prices were to drop to, say, $20 then everyone would buy houses and the market would clear right away. On the other hand, inflation can just keep going up &amp; up (c.f. Zimbabwe).
The "learned" macroeconomic answer is, sure, but our wise central bankers are committed to keeping inflation in a nice little bound. I just don't know if I buy the idea that they can really control the genie once it's out of the bottle. Supposedly wise wizard Bernanke "saved" us from economic calamity back in '08...

As a centralized organization, they have to "play by the rules" for better or worse. If they want to use CounterParty (or any other system) to issue *actual, legally defined* shares in their company, they need to get the approval of the SEC. The supposed benefit here is that the share issuance and trading could bypass the traditional gatekeepers, i.e. the NYSE or whatever. However, considering the interests involved, it seems to me a single "thumbs-down" could sink the entire project.
To my knowledge, we have yet to see a truly decentralized organization/corporation issue crypto-shares in itself in such a way that actually affords some kind of ownership "rights" to the shareholder. It's fun to imagine what such an organization would look like.

OK, I understand what you're saying. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that money as a store of value should be a "universal" scale of value. Just because someone's life *can* be measured in monetary terms (i.e. net worth, salary, etc) certainly doesn't mean that it's the *only* scale on which we can (or should) value others.
Nonetheless, money emerges because the "stuff" (including sometimes labor of others) that we need both to live and prosper is scarce. Therefore, the need for a given thing, as expressed in a price, is an essential indicator of the scarcity (or lack thereof) of that thing. This signaling mechanism, in my view, is of paramount importance for the functioning of our society just as the proper potassium concentration is for the functioning of our nervous systems. To reject it out of hand is something I just can't fathom...
@_date: 2014-10-25 21:57:23
This is exactly the sort of thinking about bitcoin mining that I wish we could engage in; less "how do I make an ROI *right now* with this thing," and more how do we take a holistic approach about mining that integrates it into larger issues of waste power / waste heat.
Bitcoin miners are really interesting because it's the first time we've had a device that basically converts waste power into cash money. I don't think we as a community have been thinking about how to effectively utilize that as part of the broader energy sustainability picture.
For instance, take residential solar, say something like SolarCity. What happens to the un-utilized power from your residential system, like from 10 AM – ~ 4PM when you're not at home but the sun's out? I realize the traditional solution is "sell it back to the utilities," but they don't really need the power at 12 PM either. Why not run a small ASIC farm off that? Why not integrate this additional revenue stream into the amortization of the solar cell cost?
The cited article reflects the other end of this process, the waste heat output. Especially in colder areas, if you need to run a heater anyway, why not run one that will make you money?
We need to think more broadly, beyond just "MUH ROI!!", about how miners can be integrated into the energy balance of our daily lives.

This is very interesting, and I'm glad that more people are thinking creatively about the *highly* novel economics of bitcoin mining, rather than the over-simplified "MUH ROI!!" that tends to dominate the discussion.
Along similar lines, I believe that residential solar is another piece of the puzzle here; in many instances, excess PV energy produced by residential homes is simply sold back to the utility under net metering schemes. Assuming that the mining return in terms of $/kWh is greater than what the utility will pay, people who already have residential solar installed could potentially profit.
Or, a business model might exist for people to install &amp; maintain miners in peoples' homes. The installer would maintain and finance the equipment, and then pass a cut of the profit onto the homeowner, essentially buying the homeowner's excess electrical capacity.

Ah, this is yet another "internet in 1994" discussion that is being re-hashed for bitcoin.

Good thing that (by and large) they weren't listened to and the internet remained about as anarchic as one could expect up to the present day.

The over-simplication of bitcoin privacy issues really irks me. On the one hand you have the media saying "the anonymous cyber-cash of the future!", and on the other hand you have people on this sub going to the other extreme, as if using bitcoin is like flashing your Social Security card on the jumbotron.
Anonymity is a spectrum, not a binary thing. Any anonymization system can, in principle, be broken given enough time, analysis &amp; effort. Bitcoin is *much, much* more anonymous than anything in our current financial system. Any sort of bank account or credit card requires extensive information about who you are, where you live, your history, etc etc. Bitcoin requires none of that.
Sure, with enough chain analysis and access to the NSA's surveillance dragnet you could in principle tie addresses to individuals. But the point is, the power dynamic has shifted. I can click a single button in the blockchain.info wallet for "Shared coin," and all of a sudden an adversary's effort to track me rises exponentially. That's the point; not that it's perfect, but the ratio of effort required to anonymize vs de-anonymize financial transactions has shifted significantly with bitcoin.

I'm not sure if this is exactly what people are describing when they talk about a DAC... What you're describing here sounds almost like a virus or (given some of the more advanced capabilities that you describe) an AI that also happens to have a bitcoin wallet, copying itself around the internet and adapting to its surroundings.
The "classic" DAC model, as I understand it, is sort of in analogy to bitcoin itself as the "first" DAC. If looked at as a corporation, "Bitcoin Inc" has only one purpose: to secure transactions in the blockchain. In order to have this function performed, it "pays" miners for their labor in bitcoin, according to a varying market-rate (the difficulty level).
Now generalizing the metaphor, we might think about a DAC as an altcoin (like you said) that pays for certain machine-verifiable actions to be performed using its native token. However, rather than some program that copies itself around the internet (which isn't necessarily "decentralized"), I would think of a DAC to be more of a P2P software run on many machines simultaneously (a la bitcoin), with the "maintainers" of the DAC's system state being compensated in some way.
Here's an example: a decentralized insurance pool. Members pay in every month to the pool, and then when they get sick or get in an accident (or whatever) the pool automatically disburses funds (as long as the appropriate verification information is sent). This DAC insurance would be an open source program that takes in information about its participants, determines their risk profile according to whatever actuarial formulae, and then calculates a premium. Payouts are also well defined, and distributed automatically. This "DAC insurance" would be hugely disruptive for the insurance industry, as it would be 100% transparent and lightning quick in disbursing funds.
So there's one example... I'm sure that there are many others.

From a technical standpoint, what does it offer that bitcoin doesn't? I'm just not seeing anything novel or different with it, other than the latching on to an (inherently fleeting) meme.
I mean, it has its market place like other altcoins, but the bravado amongst its supporters that it will somehow replace BTC is IMHO entirely unwarranted. In fact, the rapid promotion of it almost feels like an attempt at "pump and dump" by people desperate to be in on the ground floor of "the next BTC."
If that's the case, here's a free tip: the "next BTC" probably isn't going to be a crypto-currency at all, but something that builds on top of it, like colored-coins, mastercoin-type crypto-equities and other such instruments. Especially with all the merchant adoption that we're starting to see now, BTC has too much of a network effect to be unseated in the near future.

I'm an ancap personally, but I realize that even in the world's most oppressive regimes there's a balance between what government power can be realistically executed and the will of the citizenry. Does the federal government have the power to, say, round everyone up into internment camps? Nuke Chicago? Shut down the internet? Sure, technically they can do all these things. But the realize that if they tried, they would be met with massive resistance, not just from "crazy libertarians" like us but from *everyone*.
So the question isn't just "what are they capable of," it's "what can they realistically do given the sociopolitical context that currently exists." And the fact of the matter is, a massive concerted (overt) attack on bitcoin right now would break with a number of precedents and likely be met with some significant resistance, even outside of r/bitcoin.

What *I'm* celebrating is the fact that the price isn't tanking, and indeed seems to be rising, despite the fact that all 3 major Chinese exchanges are effectively on a "bank holiday" as of today. This illustrates a strong degree of independence from Chinese markets.
A few weeks ago, when Houbi and OKCoin made similar announcements, the price did indeed tank. A year ago, this news would have probably dropped the price 30% or more... Back then, the bitcoin price practically hung on every word from the PBOC like they were the Fed Chairman.

The points about intermittency are the best, IMHO. Look at Elon Musk's recent announcement. Batteries *would* be the solution to the solar/wind intermittency problem, *if* they didn't (to quote Musk) "suck" so hard. Musk might have changed the game a bit with his new product.
Mining presents a parallel solution to the intermittency problem. Now with your generated solar/wind power, you have 3 options: 1: Sell it back to the grid, the standard choice right now. 2: Store it in a battery, an option that Musk made better. But also option 3: Use the power to mine BTC.
Any one of these 3 options might make sense day-to-day or perhaps hour-to-hour depending on the particular user's situation. Software could automate a sort of "energy arbitrage," maximizing profit by switching between these three options. This could turn everyone with a rooftop into an energy entrepreneur!

Bitcoin needs two sets of "prior knowledge" to successfully comprehend: One is a basic set of technical knowledge, things like open-source, cryptography, and P2P networks, and the other half is *some* understanding about money, economics and game theory.
Without a certain threshold knowledge in both of those topics, you won't understand why this is important, why it's not a Ponzi scheme, how we can "trust" the miners, etc etc. Then and only then can you start to understand the amazing ramifications for what bitcoin and related technologies can do for human society.

Follow the guidelines on the site to get started.

I don't see a high probability of success. Either 1 of 2 things happen: (1) they produce a "Bitcoin clone" that is like an altcoin, but which is differentiated from Bitcoin purely based on branding. Or (2) they pull some "private blockchain" BS of the R3-variety, in which case PBOC-coin will have a "cancel transaction" button at the disposal of government officials.
Both options result in a product that has to compete with existing e-money systems (WePay etc) and thus faces an uphill battle. Option (2) would be subject to the same currency controls that exist for all forms of money in China today, and thus fails to offer Bitcoin's biggest selling point, namely its borderless-ness.

Nobody's stopping you from mining. It's interesting that "buy and hold" is an accepted strategy, yet "mine and hold" is never discussed... Instead everyone just demands profitability *now* when it comes to mining. Nothing's stopping you from hooking up those block erupters and going to town!


Yeah nothing new comes out without some growing pains. Plenty of failed companies in the early internet too. The point is, what lessons are learned from the failures?


Nothing about the core of BTC has changed to make it any more centralized. In fact, given the number of new exchanges since last summer, it's arguable that the market is much more decentralized than before.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:18:30




We should separate two different risks here: (A) the risk that your credit card info is stolen in transit, and (B) the risk that the seller is deceptive. I would argue for the vast majority of consumers, (A) is a much bigger concern. Take for instance the Target data breach. Most consumers aren't concerned that Target will be selling them cheesy-poofs laced with arsenic; even if they get something defective, they can always take it back and get a refund, whether it's BTC or credit card. So here BTC clearly wins out, because you're not effectively sending your private keys with every transaction as you do with credit cards.
Concern (B) only comes up when (as I suspect is a large percentage of the folks here) you're trying to buy that 2nd-hand graphics card from "some guy" on the internet. Even in that instance, BTC could be used in combination with mutlisig escrow services that we're starting to see crop up. Would there be a fee? Sure, but I bet it'd still be less than credit cards.
Finally, the perks: Assuming that merchants are saving on credit card fees, that money (either terms of lower prices or benefits) will eventually be passed onto consumers. It's somewhat inevitable assuming any kind of market competition.

Good to hear. 
Planet money's coverage of bitcoin-related issues has never been very positive IMHO. I felt that the narrative that they were presenting was "Charlie Shrem's Bitcoin use landed him in prison, now he's reformed and working on *blockchain* not bitcoin." There was a similar message in their Silk Road / Ulbricht episode: a sneering "haha silly libertarians, see what happens when you defy the State?"
That being said, and while I have you on the line, there's a question that I've always wanted to ask. I'm as libertarian/anarchist as the next guy here so I don't consider your "crimes," such as you were charged with, to be anything of substance.
However, what I'd like to get your perspective on is what responsibility you feel to the public and the employees of your company. Previous to your indictment you presented yourself to the bitcoin community and to the public at large as a model of regulatory compliance. However, the substance of the indictment, namely your knowing collusion with elements of the Silk Road, would indicate that this public facade was at best disingenuous.
Again as a libertarian I don't view participation in the Silk Road as anything *morally* wrong, but it is certainly illegal activity at a point in time when you were presenting a public face of "100% compliance." How do you reconcile this today?
@_date: 2017-02-14 18:37:20
Ugh, couldn't stand this.
Planet money has always sneered at bitcoin. Their report on the Silk Road a year or two back was just dripping with that particular flavor of liberal *schadenfreude* that is on display when a an implementation of a novel libertarian idea winds up failing.
Now, they've just heard about this thing called "the blockchain," and boy are they jumping hard onto that bandwagon. All of the cool techie parts of bitcoin, but without those *icky* libertarian implications! Wow, where do I sign up?!
Shrem serves as the perfect vessel for them to simultaneously sneer at the revolutionary potential of bitcoin ("look at this guy, he *used* to be a bitcoin maximalist... till he did jail time!") and exalt the dubious potential of the "private blockchain."
As for the latter, Shrem's new project strikes me as a big ball of "meh." So he's trying to build a project to democratize investment, except that... well... he's can't actually change any of the basic rules of who can and can't invest, so what exactly is being disrupted here? You can invest with a blockchain token instead of a stock certificate? And why couldn't that just be done with a shared database?

Indeed, this puts Open Assets on solid footing to become *the* colored coin protocol.
It's interesting to contrast this with the other 2.0 platforms, Mastercoin/Counterparty/etc. Open Assets is the "simplest" implementation of these ideas, which might lack some of the more advanced features of these other protocols, keeps its functionality mostly analogous to bitcoin itself. I.e. colored coins are transferred as actual amounts of bitcoin (with color data coming "along for the ride" in OP_RETURN), as opposed to all balances and transactions being encoded in OP_RETURN.
This is a great lesson to engineer-types who are always looking to tinker, add, and complicate: The simplest, most elegant implementation of a core idea that does only 1-3 things but does them well tends to win out over a jumbled Swiss Army knife, in which tradeoffs are made to make all the pieces fit together.

Colored coins, and the Open Assets implementation, is merely a layer for encoding information on top of otherwise "ordinary" bitcoin transactions. That's it, really; this is more like a HTML markup layer saying "this bitcoin output represents something else."
What the colored coin represents could be literally anything, the "value" of which might be real or entirely suspect. The coin could represent an access token for a building, it could represent a stock certificate, or it could represent a share in a [half-eaten ice cream cone]( Ultimately, it relies on trust between the issuer and issuee.

From my understanding (and this was based on his retelling so it's not unbiased), he was literally "made an example of," as in that same language was used by the prosecutors. So yeah they basically railroaded him.
However, while the legal case &amp; resulting jailtime seem fairly ridiculous, there *is* a case to be made that he had been engaging in deceptive practices with his employees and the broader public. Before he was arrested he would make a big deal about compliance, and indeed claim "over-compliance" as the only way to operate a bitcoin business. This is at best disingenuous when he was simultaneously doing business with someone that he knew was linked, however tendentiously, to Silk Road.
Don't get me wrong, I object to the "full stack" of the government's case here, from the laws used to prosecute him to the specific methods of the prosecution. But that doesn't mean that he didn't do anything "wrong" in a business-ethical sense.

@_date: 2015-01-20 18:10:10


The thing is, I don't think that it's possible to regulate "forex through Bitcoin." Once you have bitcoin, there's no way for the government to tell whether you're going to use it to buy a cheesesteak or send it across international borders. Therefore, you can't really regulate the "bitcoin as remittance" use case vs "bitcoin as currency."
Stated another way, there's not likely to be any such thing as a "bitcoin remittance company." What you'll have instead are simply bitcoin exchanges in both countries. Any potential regulation will have to happen on the exchange level, but it's practically impossible for to regulate remittance as a separate category from anything else.

First, don't know why (at the moment) you're getting downvoted, these are valid concerns.
However, I don't think that the AOL comparison is on point here; AOL, CompuServe and other such services of the mid-to-late 90's were manifestations of "the information superhighway" as distinct from "the internet." They were entirely separate, self-contained and centralized information infrastructures. Once they offered a gateway to the outside internet, their relevance quickly evaporated.
Coinbase on the other hand is simply offering an "on-ramp" to the already robust and decentralized bitcoin network. I don't think that Coinbase, its investors, nor the wall street crowd in general have any secret dastardly plan to "neuter" bitcoin. They accept bitcoin for bitcoin, and are more concerned with providing market-making mechanisms to allow it to interface with the legacy financial structure (and thus do what wall st always and forever wants to do: make money).


Look, if Coinbase isn't providing in their wallet a button that says "send" that allows you to send bitcoin to X address, then they fundamentally aren't offering a bitcoin wallet. It remains up to the market to decide what people want; do they want to actually own bitcoin, and have full power to send them wherever they please? Or do they just want a "bitcoin stock certificate," like a gold ETF or something?

Yes, and I understand that these laws are at best almost impossible to prosecute, and at worst fundamental violations of economic freedom and healthy functioning markets. All trading is insider trading on some level. What if I'm a PhD scientist and I make a lab discovery about a new solar cell, and invest in materials based on that? What about the entrepreneur who sees an opportunity that nobody else sees because of information that he obtained through private conversations, and invests based on it?
Shouldn't we actually *want* insider trading, as this allows those with access to knowledge that others don't have to be used to profit, thereby transmitting signals to the rest of the market? Like arguments about inequality, the notion that everyone should have access to all market-relevant information simultaneously is as ludicrous as saying that everyone should have the same car or house.
It's ridiculous and counter-productive to criminalize what's in someone's head at the time they make an economic decision based on some fairy-tale notion of information equality that will *never* exist in the real world.

Payroll taxes, the brainchild of so-called libertarian godfather Milton Friedman, are really quite insidious in a way. You never "see" the money coming out of your paycheck unless you scrutinize your pay stub, and that makes a psychological difference from the equivalent of men knocking at your door saying "pay up". 
It's a subtle thing, but I feel like there is a different mass psychology that might emerge if the government is required to lean much more heavily on property taxation. It's government "in your face" vs behind the scenes. Remember that aside from the most batshit-crazy liberals, nobody *likes* to pay their taxes.

All good questions. I think that the answer lies in decentralized prediction markets, the like of which is being developed by projects like TruthCoin. All insurance can be described as a particular form of a prediction market; you make a "bet" that a particular adverse event will happen to you, and the insurer bets against it. If you "lose" (as you should hope to), you pay your premium to the insurer. If you "win," you get the payout.
So now the problem is to provide accurate machine-verifiable information about real-world events. There are several potential solutions to this... TruthCoin itself provides a sort of mechanism for sorting out what happened based on voting. For something like auto insurance, if you imagine a future where cars "know" then they've been in an accident, the cars own digital signature might be proof enough that you were in an accident.
Even simpler versions might be constructed using multisignature bitcoin transactions with 3 parties, the insurer, insured, and a "claims verifier" agreed to by both parties. Even this would be a huge step ahead of what we have now... Right now, it's the job of the insurance company to verify claims, and they have a natural incentive to deny claims.

This is *exactly* how bitcoin can compete with a centralized company. A centralized company has to comply with all federal, local, state, and international regulations specifically regarding international money transfer. Bitcoin is essentially "unregulatable" as a mode of international remittance; once you have bitcoin, there's no easy way for the government to tell whether you're sending it to your friend down the block or your aunt in the Philippines.
Saying Bitcoin has no advantage over (say) Western Union in the long term makes about as much sense as saying that Uber has no advantage over taxis. One has to comply with a bevy of regulations and has used its position to become a "rentier"; the other does an end-run around regulation with technology.

Did he make any concerted effort to re-iterate the government's case that yes, indeed Ulbricht = DPR?

Yes, but according to the (apparent) defense theory he had only briefly been "the new DPR" when they nabbed him. I.e... He wasn't in charge during all the murder-for-hire and everything else.

You've posed no reason why this would happen. People will want to use bitcoin to send to their friends, their neighbors, a vending machine, etc etc. This is an essential selling point of bitcoin. If Coinbase doesn't let them do this, they'll just send their BTC to another wallet that does.

I think you just illustrated the article's point: It was damn difficult to use the internet back then. 


Yahoo was never as good as google. Google was a quantum leap in search that made the web significantly more useable.


I don't see the parallel... Sure, technological life cycles have gotten shorter; but what really matters is the diffusion of both knowledge and productive capital through society. The entrepreneurs that will make bitcoin indispensible in the future today are probably working jobs that they aren't super passionate about but pay the bills. Some day, in 3-5 years, they'll be looking for a new gig. They'll know what bitcoin is and what it can do, and maybe they'll spot a unique opportunity to use its strengths to capture an new market. Then others see this, and start jumping on board.

We can't predict in advance what the market will or will not demand. Implied in the scenario that you're presenting is that people will only use bitcoin to buy things online using their Coinbase wallets, basically use it like Paypal. I disagree; people are going to want to use bitcoin for all sorts of things, i.e. gaming, gambling, sending to friends / relatives, etc etc. If Coinbase doesn't offer a wallet with a "send" button on it, or puts up any barriers to people using the technology how they wish, they *will* be left behind by the marketplace.

Yes and no... Bitcoin doesn't need regulatory compliance. There's only a "last mile" problem if the people receiving the remittance need to convert it back into a local currency.
What if you have a situation where the local currency is in and of itself unstable? Or, say you can convert bitcoin to something like M-Pesa or the equivalent "phone minutes"?
Just like how many developing countries skip building costly copper phone infrastructure and go straight to cellular, maybe now because of bitcoin we find a detour around "the last mile."

A wireless access point is a device that acts as a gatekeeper to the network. Therefore, as I see it at least, the access point itself needs to host the software controlling the payment. What other implementation is there? Are you saying that the computer acts as a sort of "master controller" for the access point, in which case the two would have to be connected 24/7?
This strikes me as way more complicated than just loading some kind of software onto the router/AP itself, which must be do-able because every commercial wifi has some sort of access control splash screen.

The truthcoin system includes a very clever mechanism for dealing with this (it's explained in [this podcast]( ).
My understanding is that it works something like this: In order to validate the real-world events corresponding to predictions, a wide array of voters are polled. Their results are aggregated and they are "scored" (i.e. rewarded in cryptocurrency) in proportion to how well their responses *match everyone else's*, not just on one event but on several. In this way, conformity is rewarded, and a few people trying to influence the vote one way or another on certain issues are punished.

The miner theory is interesting. As I understand it, what he's proposing is that miners are getting squeezed out of the market by the low price, and they are liquidating bitcoin (i.e. selling for fiat) in the process.
What I don't understand is, wouldn't this "liquidation" process be mostly selling hard goods (i.e. mining equipment, property etc) for hard currency ($'s) to pay off $-denominated debt? Why should this result in lots of new BTC on the market, especially if previously they were presumably selling off most of their BTC to pay for expenses?

This is an important point. Despite all of our "friendly disagreements" about scaling issues, Bitcoin is a technology that *works today* and is an open platform on which anyone can build.

The smart contract functionality that's built into bitcoin clearly feeds into a larger vision of how society could be organized. Things like assurance contracts and multisignature escrow are the fundamental building blocks for a stateless society.

People still seem to think bitcoin is some kind of fad. Fads, especially in the age of always-on instant communication, get born and die more rapidly then ever before. Take something like the ALS ice bucket challenge: Rapid rise, peak, rapid descent to 0. Only 1-2 months later you looked like a moron if you were dumping ice water over your head on YouTube. William Gibson was particularly prescient about an accelerated form of this, and I'm loosely quoting from Neuromancer: "Entire subcultures are born, live their lives, and die in the span of a week."
Bitcoin is nothing like that, it's been like a slow-building magma pressure front... It started years ago deep underground with anonymous hackers and anarchists, it's now spreading up past the bedrock of real VC investment. Sure there are little hotspots &amp; geysers popping up like Cyprus or the December 2013 China/Willybot/whatever bubble. These make it *look* like a fad, because it follows exactly the same trajectory, fast run up, fast peak, fast drop. But the pressure is still there, just beneath the surface, and it's going to start blowing out everywhere soon.

Repeating what I said on this thread, I think there *is* a real value proposition to the consumer: Easy, quick mobile payments with significantly less risk than your credit card.

We already see a general movement towards getting rid of credit cards: Google Wallet, Square Wallet and others are examples of that. There is some kind of broader demand for mobile payments that bitcoin can fit nicely into. It's just the "getting bitcoin" part that I think is a bit problematic at this point.

In other words, the average Western middle-class consumer might be the last person to have to learn &amp; use bitcoin.

I'm not going to get into the "what if 8 guys come at you with crowbars" hypotheticals. Security is a good that can be contracted and paid for like any other good we currently receive from the marketplace. If everything is private property, then the responsibility is incumbent on private owners of property (and indeed all of us are self-owners) to protect said property. This can be done either through self-defense, or by contracting with agencies to deliver said protection. Most of our lives are not threatened by violence on a daily basis, and so this does not have to be expensive.

But how is this transaction "regulated" in any meaningful sense? Which State-based agency do I call if I am aggrieved?
Are you arguing that regulation is essential for a free market? Mobile telephone service in Somalia could be argued as an example of a "free market" that exists without regulation. Trade between Native American tribes occurred without any regulation that applied to both parties.

I think the time it ripe for exactly such a transition to happen. Never before in recent history has trust in "institutions," broadly defined, been so low (too lazy to cite right now, but I'm sure you can find plenty of Economist articles talking about this). Whether it's "too-big-to-fail" banks or corrupt governments, large institutions aren't exactly trusted like they used to be.

Why would the same banks who collect the fees be interested in lowering them?
And what exact "transfer time" are we talking about here? Apps like Venmo allow you to send money "instantaneously," in that you see a little green checkbox on your app after you push the button.
What happens behind the scenes is a complex dance of legally required AML/KYC checks and a bunch of other bureaucratic BS that could, at any point, reverse your little green check box. None of that would change, because the banks either can't change or don't have to incentive to change it. So how exactly is settlement sped up? To any level that approaches that of a bitcoin transaction?

OK didn't realize the line of questioning here. Yes, some sort of network access is necessary for any implementation of smart property. This is because whenever the device is accessed, it has to ask the question "who owns me now?", and the user has to prove ownership.
There are many ways to accomplish this... LTE (cell network) chips are relatively cheap, especially if we're talking about something like a car. For smaller objects you could have WiFi/bluetooth network functionality.

Agree, original article should have said "ordinary Western consumers" or something to that effect.
But the point still stands in that for the near-future, even in the developing world, ordinary people might not hold bitcoin for any significant amount of time because they can't use it locally.

For example, Amazon credits for Mechanical Turk work, various forms of mobile-phone minutes, etc etc...

But practically speaking there's always a line the government can't cross. Once services like Uber or Airbnb scale large enough (to the point where governments will care), there is a significant contingent of people who derive real economic value from them and thus will push back against heavy-handed government response. If we now imagine "decentralized Uber/Airbnb," now the actual practical actions required to shut down this activity becomes even more draconian (i.e. random car / house inspections), and thus more unpopular.
Not that I'm saying governments are moral or "care" in any meaningful way about what their citizenry thinks, but whether we're talking about Sweden or North Korea, there is a practical line that if crossed will result in "revolt," broadly defined. There are always more citizens than government agents (lemma).


Anarcho-capitalists *have* been talking [for quite some time]( about about how to replace and improve on the "genuinely useful functions" of government, and many of these solutions map quite nicely onto the crypto-anarchy project.
Let's take your pesky government agency trying to shut down decentralized Airbnb. Any practical enforcement regime would probably take the form of random inspections, with fines &amp; penalties for those caught. If we model this as essentially a form of "natural disaster," we can start to think about decentralized insurance contracts against this risk. Those caught would have their fines paid by the insurance pool, and the pool operators would have a significant incentive to reduce the effectiveness of the government enforcers.

The current or future profitability of mining has many more contributing factors than just the bitcoin price. A wide variety of capital costs, including mining hardware, energy costs, financing costs, and of course difficulty fluctuations all contribute to mining viability. In fact, the price might matter very little relative to all these other factors, at least in trying to obtain a marginal advantage.
IMHO we should hope that mining difficulty continues a slow and predictable climb, as ASIC technology catches up to the frontiers Moore's law (rather than lagging it by an unpredictable delay). This makes the hardware a commodity and emphasizes the search for cheap renewable energy sources in order to gain competitive advantage.
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:42:10
It's *basically* first mover. Anything like this should be expected to acquire a huge "network effect" making new entrants difficult without significantly better use cases. The core innovation here IMHO is the ability to transmit a scarce token around the world with (a) a consensus ledger that (b) cannot be censored. Bitcoin has done that since ~ 2011, still does it to this day, and has the most "proof of concept" of anything else.
I think the fact that Satoshi was and stayed anonymous is important as well. Many other projects these days have some figurehead (e.g. Buterin) or, in the case of many of the new ICO's/blockchains, are explicitly or implicitly the property of some startup or other.
This undercuts the notion of non-censorability, and without that, what's the point? It's like a company running a P2P music service; you'd be better off just serving the music off of an AWS instance. The only point of P2P is to resist censorship.

But this isn't true. Specific action is required by government authorities to subpoena the information from the merchant to link your shipping address with your bitcoin address, and even if they do they can only link you to 1 transaction chain, again assuming your wallet doesn't re-use addresses. Furthermore, governments would have to do this with *every* merchant whose data they want, since there's no centralized clearinghouse for all BTC merchant transactions.
Compare this to the credit card network, which is one big centralized honeypot of every transaction linked to a bank account/physical address. Someone can just push a button and see your entire credit &amp; transaction history. I don't think there's really any comparison.

I agree, although I'd still like to defend bitcoin as a currency, albeit a sort of "startup commodity-based money", which I agree is something that we're generally not used to thinking about.
We've had new currencies, like the Euro, but not in recent memory. We've also had commodity monies, i.e. gold, but their origin is so far back in the mists of pre-history that the notion of a "new" commodity money also doesn't really map.

But with CCs, *all* parties participating in the system are known by default, whereas in Bitcoin all parties are *unknown* by default. Add in the fact that most modern wallets generate new addresses by default, and I think it's safe to say that BTC is a lot more anonymous than CCs.

I think that there are some interesting contradictions that the article raises w.r.t. the whole "prepper" movement, especially in the context of the ultra-rich:


This kind of reminds me of that episode of South Park where Cartman inherits a $million, buys an amusement park, and promptly kicks everyone out. However he soon realizes that (much to his chagrin) the rides need maintenance, the toilets start backing up, etc etc. So he has to let more people in each day in order to pay to run the place, until the point at which the park is just as crowded as before.
The silver lining here is that IMHO bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrencies can serve as a "safety net" against certain flavors of economic apocalypse that these guys are "prepping" for. From the article:

It's much bigger than communism, and goes back further. In James C. Scott's classic anarchist work [The Art of Not Being Governed]( he discusses a problem that States have had since antiquity: keeping their subjects' activity *legible.* Legibility in this context means visible, and therefore taxable.
So in *The Art* and the particular context of pre-colonial Southeast Asia, "legible" meant irrigated rice farming. The State and its enforcers can clearly see how many rice paddies there are, and therefore can tax the farmers, and plan their military campaigns accordingly.
You know what fucks all that up? A bunch of people who go run for the hills, plant their own crops and hide them from the State. Totally *illegible.* Does not compute. Must ban!

Whatever "plunder" you acquire has to pay for *all* of this.
Now on the other side of the equation, in a modern market economy there are significantly wealthy interests that generally want to keep the wheels of commerce running...

True, but in many places net metering schemes have been under attack from utilities. At the start of the year, Nevada abruptly ended its net metering program, and while [the decision was reversed]( recently, the solar installation industry in that state took a bit hit. AFAIK Hawaii's net metering program is still [shut down](
Going forward, it's not clear whether the incentives of the utilities from a business perspective are well-aligned with distributed power generation, and I think that we'll see many such conflicts in the future. BTC mining might serve as a "3rd way," used in conjunction with existing net metering and batteries to make renewable a good deal.


You're right. Solar energy is variable. But batteries are still costly, and have to be sized properly... What happens when the battery fills up? The choice is to either take what the utility gives you in net metering, or the power just gets wasted. Again, could a reasonably sized mining rig be a "3rd way"?

Which just begs the question of why are large financial institutions interested in blockchains to begin with? Low cost transactions? Can't be that, they basically own the rails (ACH/SWIFT/etc). So it's some kind of transparency argument? But that doesn't make sense either since on their own private "blockchains" the banks will have the "delete" button for all transactions.
It just always seems like the Big Problem that blockchains solve for banks are actually fundamental aspects of their business/regulatory model.

Earth has a planet-wide communication system, it's called the *CyberWeb* I think


Who cares? Am I licensed to send money to Australia? No, but I can with bitcoin, and nobody can stop me.


There's an indelible record of transactions that bitcoin runs on, I think it's the *blerkchain* if I'm not mistaken. I can cryptographically prove my entire lending history using it.


Umm... It's code? Look up the white paper?


Good question. Obviously presuming a semi-centralized or completely decentralized marketplace for P2P loans, there would be reputation penalties for defaulting. In addition, [smart loans can be created with "smart property" collateral](

As someone who's used these machines as well as containing some general knowledge of bitcoin I think I can answer some of your questions...


This is a confusing question, particularly the "or" which implies that the two options are somehow exclusionary. You do understand that bitcoins aren't a physical product and thus "stocking" is a little difficult to define in this context, yes? Moreover, given any reasonable volume of transactions it's likely that operators of these machines have some kind of exchange account, as this is just about the only way to acquire bitcoins for profitable resale (assuming that they aren't mining).


Most ATM's I've come across have buy and sell functionality, but some are "buy only."


Do you mean a paper wallet? No, I've rarely seen that functionality.


I've seen them print receipts of transactions, but that's not a bitcoin in any meaningful sense. 


Yes, this is the normal functionality.... Most of them have optical scanners to read QR codes.

Well, in the example of an blockchain-immobilizer-linked car, the "big mean person" can't do anything with the car they "stole". Without the private key, all they have is a brick.
That being said, the example doesn't apply as well to other forms of property, such as a house. Sure you could have smart locks on the door, but ultimately a house cannot be rendered "unusable" in the same way an immobilizer acts on a car.


This is the same "problem" with bitcoin. I put "problem" in quotes because many would say that it isn't actually a problem... In the sense that the idea of crypto-assets replaces the final say of ownership in the hands of code rather than human beings. For some people, i.e. people who are skeptical of government, this is a good thing, especially because the human element can always be re-introduced *as needed* by multi-signature with 3rd-party judges, etc.
The only difference is that property (whether cryptocurrency or smart property) is no longer *forced by default* into having the State as its "arbiter of last resort." We can design our own systems for assigning or re-assigning ownership that are independent of whatever government happens to preside over the patch of land on which we stand.

If you own the ATM, it's yours, and you're taking the bitcoin you acquire from the exchange (or wherever) and reselling them. Exchanges don't directly own or operate these machines AFAIK.


Well from a customer perspective I don't want to go through the onerous registration and identity verification processes required to have an exchange account. It might not be a big deal for some people, and many of the ATMs require some kind of verification anyway, but I'd personally like to minimize the paper trail as much as possible.

True, he was never charged for the murder for hire (but of course they were able to sneak it into the indictment, so he was "kinda" on trial for that too).
I guess it's more of the moral issue of, did this guy "push the button" to have people tortured and killed. Knowing as we know now that the torture/murder was never on the table doesn't absolve him of thinking it was when/if he made the decision.
As others have pointed out, the murder for hire stuff is kind of a "puppy-kick" moment for DPR. Without it he's basically Robin Hood to the Drug War. With it, he's late-series Walter White, fully willing to kill in cold blood to protect his empire. Whether it's real or not matters.

No I think this is correct. Andreas has talked about this before... If we aren't already there, we need to get as rapidly as possible to the point where ASIC hardware is directly following Moore's law rather than "catching up to it." This way ASICs become pieces of commodity hardware with predictable upgrade schedules.
Then, two things happen: 1. mining becomes solely about energy cost rather than any sort of proximity to the chip foundry or specialized knowledge of semiconductor processes, and 2. capital can be allocated based on *predictable* changes in ASIC power that correlate to Moore's law, rather than *erratic* changes as ASIC manufacturers catch up to current-generation techniques.
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:45:38


I think this is technically true (Edit: in an "all of things being equal" sense), but there are also a lot of moving parts here. Assuming that the price continues to go up, the revenue side of the equation keeps getting better. Now as ASIC hardware becomes less of "custom specialized equipment" and more of commodity hardware (i.e. it catches up to Moore's law), mining becomes less about who gets access to the latest generation of hardware and more about who has cheap power.
Combine this with the price of solar halving every few years, and you create a situation where access to the latest and cheapest *energy* technologies gets you a mining advantage... Which is kind of cool because it directly incentivizes renewable/alternative energy development.

Their graph was kind of deceptive if this was published on the 11th... Prices have recovered back to the pre-election levels for the most part.
The question that I had was whether bitcoin really is "uncorrelated" with other assets, as the commenter mentioned. If you followed the price during election night and after, it seems to be pretty strongly anti-correlated with the markets (which is a different thing than *un*correlated btw).
During election night when it looked like it was going to get called for Trump, Dow futures dropped, and at the same time we saw the pump from 710 --&gt; ~740. Then he made his acceptance speech, and I guess the fact that he sounded reasonably conciliatory and didn't drop any f-bombs calmed markets back down.... Dow recovered losses, and bitcoin came back down.
Perhaps bitcoin is going to be the market's barometer for "OMG Trump's gonna blow everything up"? Like, if/when he gets back on Twitter flamewar troll-train, expect prices to go back up.

This is the future of mining. Now that ASIC development has basically caught up with Moore's law, the cost of energy becomes critical. Those who have access to cheap, easily obtainable energy will gain the most advantage in mining, rather than who's closest to the Bitmain factory.
In particular, this will be a boon for renewable energy, most of which suffers from the well-known "intermittency" problem. I.e. the sun only shines during the day, and the wind only blows at night, and both sometimes don't work at all.
With bitcoin mining, renewable energy production during low-demand times (middle of the night for wind, etc) can still bring real revenue. This allows the renewable energy operator (or, in the case of residential solar, homeowners) significantly more bargaining power with power purchasers.
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:38:25
Hmm, interesting. So basically the more powerful mining rigs in terms of Hashes/second are *also* more energy efficient in terms of Hashes/kWh?
Is this fundamentally an issue of chip development in terms of computing power, or of efficiency? That is to say, are the more advanced miners using ASICs that are more powerful with the same power consumption as older generations (and they're just packing more into the box), or are they just getting better at power efficiency for the same hashing power?
Any of that makes sense? Thinking aloud here...

The main counter-argument against bitcoin for cannabis businesses is that they can't pay their vendors with it.

Actually, one could imagine situations in which physical property can be linked to digital tokens. The notion of "smart property" can be applied to this. It doesn't necessarily apply universally, but in the context of automobiles it might make some sense.
For instance, all modern cars have immobilizers. Said immobilizer could be programmed to accept only a blockchain token. Computers could be similarly locked.

Sure, the concept of blockchain-based ownership doesn't map perfectly to the real world of physical objects, but it can overlap stronger than it does today.
The interesting thing here is that bitcoin engenders an entirely new concept of "ownership." One can "own" a bitcoin in a stronger sense of the word than one "owns" one's house, car, or even the fiat in your bank account. The latter properties are all contingent on government-backed deeds/titles, supported by government courts and government enforcement agencies. Bitcoin requires none of that.
The question is, can we translate this "strong" concept of ownership out of the realm of digital currency and into the real world of physical objects? Not perfect, no... but stronger than it is today, yes, I think.

So now we're in this awkward phase where Jenkins doesn't quite know how to express to his boss that the idea of a "private blockchain" is built on logical quicksand. We've got ~ 6 months before he hires someone to pin the blame on for the project's inevitable failure.

Taaki maybe... But IMHO Cody Wilson has a fairly articulate (anti-)political program he's advancing, as he explains in this [Vice mini-doc]( The 3d printed gun is a milestone, not for its technical achievement, but as a big conceptual middle finger at the modern democratic nation state.
We're all taught in 7th grade social studies that in our system the balance between freedom and security is decided through a *process*. We all have a "national conversation" in the pages of the NY Times or whatever, we elect our representatives, then they go to Washington and vote. Guns or no guns? Drugs or no drugs? Slightly more or slightly less welfare/warfare state?
The 3D printed gun *ends* the entire discussion w.r.t. guns. What's the point? They can pass any law they want, but the inexorable march of progress means that soon, anyone who wants a gun will have one. We can try to prepare ourselves for when that day comes, but there's no "law" that will stop it.
Bitcoin will do a similar thing with money. We're still talking about "capital controls" as if that's a *decision* governments get to make. It won't be, not for much longer. Now that bitcoin exists, it's been decided... Not by a "national conversation," but by technology.
So we've got guns, money... what else? I have a feeling it's only the beginning...
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:06:48


If you point a gun at someone's head and pull the trigger in cold blood then yes you're a murderer in my book, even if the bullet miraculously ricochets away at the last moment. Are *you* comfortable living in a society with someone who does that?


Self-defense of my person and property is an *entirely* separate issue to unilaterally deciding that some people must die so that I will not have to go to jail. Oh and also ordering them to be tortured to get *muh money* back (how is *that* self-defense?).
This is what you call a "disproportionate response," no better then when governments cluster bomb towns to take out 1 person.


Again, if you pull that trigger in cold blood, from *my* perspective the difference between whether you actually killed someone or not is academic. *I* don't want to share a society with someone who gets to unilaterally decide whether I live or die. Do you?
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:50:50

This is an interesting question, how does the market "perceive" bitcoin? As a commodity-like hedge against uncertainty, which (like gold) you would expect to go up during market crashes? Or as a volatile "high-risk/high-reward" tech stock that might expect to get dumped at the first sign of trouble? I'm not sure if the market really "knows" how to price it yet.


Well this is the old "they're going to cut the internet lines" argument, but there's a *whole lot* that will happen before that. Capital controls for instance, which can only serve boost bitcoin's value and utility as the *only* monetary instrument that can be transmitted around the world free of any government oversight. Plus, they tried shutting down cell networks during the Hong Kong protests and people just switched to Bluetooth mesh networks. Unless you're proposing global thermonuclear war, the internet's going to be damned hard to shut down from this point forward.

But if we actually got to the point where bitcoin is big enough and such a ban is taken by the government as a reactionary measure, businesses would have a massive incentive to accept bitcoin by whatever means they can (because in this scenario bitcoin is rapidly becoming the only money with value). The government can't just lock everyone up. They'd have to compromise.
The only way this could potentially work is if the government decided today (while bitcoin is still basically a niche product) to ban it, but it doesn't look like that's happening anytime soon either.

I for one have moved beyond this perspective. Price *has* to matter, if for no other reason than that miners need to be incentivized to do proof of work.

Most major technological disruptions, especially in the digital realm, have political ramifications. We (as in Western society) don't think about the internet very much in political terms because a technology that allows for censorship-resistant speech isn't a big deal for countries that have long-established traditions of free speech. However, in China as well as many countries of the middle east, the internet absolutely *cannot* be divorced from politics, because it allows a freedom that the body politic is at best uncomfortable with and at worst actively hostile towards.
Consequently, there is (in my mind) no escaping the fact that a technology like bitcoin that allows for money laundering laws to be broken with the push of a button, thereby actively usurping the claimed legal domain of the State, will inevitably have a "political agenda."
We can use this as a teachable moment to explain to people how ridiculous it is that the State creates laws and restrictions on how we spend our own money... But (personally) I think that it's disingenuous to claim that one can somehow strip all political ramifications out of bitcoin and turn it into an Aibo or Tamagotchi.

Impossible without an understanding of the specifics of the proposal, which are almost never on display. All we get is murmurs from the chattering classes to the effect of "Citibank's gonna just make their own blockchain, without bitcoin!," which is a clearly ignorant statement.
*Or*, Fidelity could be smart and use colored coins/counterparty/whatever to utilize the huge miner network and network effect that bitcoin offers while delivering the capability of distributed, trust-less asset transfer.
If it's the former, then yes, they *are* making a huge mistake. If it's the latter, well, bully on them. But let's be clear: large, well-funded corporations make big mistakes all the time, especially when it comes to underestimating network effects... Google+ anyone?

The reality is that your money, rather than actually traveling over the internet in any meaningful sense, is sent over the [same creaking antiquated rails]( that the banks have been using for the past 30 years. At any point along the line, any number of accountants, comptrollers, compliance officers, AI supercomputers and god knows what else can say "[nope, not happening]( and then your transaction gets a big red "X."

The difference is that *nobody* can stop me from sending bitcoin anywhere in the world without physically shutting down all my means of communication. This is fundamentally different from what Paypal, Venmo or anything else in the "fintech" world can offer.

I don't think that there's any escaping the notion that bitcoin, the first successful &amp; truly transnational electronic money, is highly libertarian (or even anarchist) in its implications if not in its actual design.

Now in a world in which open-source &amp; free operating systems and programming languages are standard, *perhaps* there's a dawning realization out there that sure, with closed source you create a revenue stream, but with open source you create an *ecosystem.*

Not quite understanding what you mean here... Careless behavior on whose part? Ulbricht was, at least in that moment, engaging in pretty decent op-sec; he was on Tor on a public wifi in a place that doesn't charge access (i.e. the library) so there would be no way of tracing a transaction at a paid establishment (i.e. coffee shop, etc)... Furthermore his laptop would self-encrypt if he closed the lid, hence the need to physically grab him by surprise.
Look I'd love to believe that he was framed, but I just have never heard a convincing alternative narrative. Allegedly he had the SR admin page open. Is the idea that they just made all that up? And planted the chat logs to boot? Where did all the bitcoin they seized come from?

While you're right in the sense that in our current economic structure banks have a role in providing credit, from the point of view of their *customers,* i.e. most people, the function of banks is simply a secure place to store and retrieve funds.
And in this capacity Bitcoin absolutely can replace banks. It stores funds that can be retrieved later. In fact, Bitcoin does more because it's not simply an account but also a payment protocol. But the basic depository service that banks provide is absolutely present in Bitcoin at the protocol level.

It is not a contradiction to believe that Ulbricht's case was an absolute travesty of prosecutorial malfeasance, *but* that he did indeed order and pay for what he thought was going to be the torture and execution of informants.
I mean, the guy was caught with an open laptop in a library with the SR admin page open and logs confessing everything that happened.

That is to say, I can *own* a bitcoin, in an absolute and complete sense, indeed in a stronger sense than any form of ownership that has previously existed in human history. *But*... no one "owns" bitcoin as a whole.

This doesn't refute my point. Most people in most of their interactions with banks use it as a way to store and retrieve funds.

True, there's a very rational business case to be made there.
I don't know what the solution is, but it highlights a fundamental problem for how you fit bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into the current model for Tech companies, which is 1. build a platform, 2. monetize with ads and/or fees. Open-source cryptocurrency doesn't easily allow you to be the "toll collector."
But it raises another question, which is what does it mean to be Twitch? Is it just a combination of a technical streaming platform, and the ads to support it? Or is it a real community that would continue to exist even if the streaming and monetary aspects were completely disintermediated?

Eh... I think at this point we have to consider as "very low" the possibility that another cryptocurrency will overtake bitcoin, and I think that most of the smart money agrees. I don't see any serious contenders out there right now gaining traction (read: market share), unless you can name some...
And the problem with the "just invest in the companies" strategy is that bitcoin, if it takes off, is going to be far bigger than any single company (or even groups of companies). And unlike with any previous internet technology, i.e. Facebook, the equivalence between investment and captured value is not nearly the same.
Example: If you invest in Facebook (say 5%), you *own* 5% of all of the captured value of that platform, the advertiser revenue, the net present value, all of it. If you invest in 5% of Coinbase, you don't own 5% of bitcoin. You own whatever value Coinbase can capture from bitcoin, which might pale in comparison to bitcoin's growth.
This is why (AFAIK) Chamath Palihapitiya asks his bitcoin startups: "Show to me that investment in you will yield better returns than investment in bitcoin." It's not an easy sell.

Until I hear otherwise I assume that this will be some kind of "Franken-bitcoin" proposal, in which the oil of the legacy financial system is mixed with the water of permission-less, stateless bitcoin network, with predictable results.
Here's how you do *real* cryptosecurities:
All company assets, including both digital currencies and physical assets, are stored in multiple tiers of multisignature addresses &amp; smart contracts, with their governance tied into various voting mechanisms of the cryptosecurity shareholders. Once smart property advances, this could be implemented all the way down to locks on the doors, immobilizers on vehicles, etc.
This means that the stock ownership, and the fiduciary control that it entails, is *literally embedded* into the company assets themselves. This also means that, just as bitcoin is non-confiscatable, the company itself becomes non-confiscatable.

Can you describe this in more depth? Because from my perspective, if I go to a doctor, it means there's something wrong with my body that I'd like taken care of. The outcome here is that the bad thing that is in my body is fixed. Ultimately, who is the better arbiter of whether the problem was dealt with than the patient himself?

Sure, people bring a lot of irrationality into their perceptions of health care. One of the most irrational notions IMHO is the idea that basic laws of economics fly out the window whenever we talk about health care, because, you know, "*this is life and death we're talking about here!*", or some such appeal to emotion. Also, there's a bunch of BS fueled by years of doctor shows on TV where we're programmed to see doctors as some sort of sainted "other", oblivious to something as dismal as economics.
Well, news flash: doctors are mechanics. They're mechanics for your "humours." They're there to make the machine of your body keep going. All of the same information asymmetries apply at the doctor's office as do in the mechanic shop... Yet somehow the latter market seems to function fine without massive regulation and cartelization. Should we perhaps ask ourselves, why?

Yes, I suppose the central problem here is "how do you capture value from open source?" I think that smart investors understand that network effects and the specialized knowledge that comes from being a "first mover" is the way to go here. C.f. RedHat or BitTorrent (the companies). I wonder what Peter Thiel thinks of these enterprises, because they're kinda incompatible with his idea of "get your own little monopoly."
As bitcoin continues to grow, this question will become paramount as investors who "wanna get a piece of that" will probably have to scramble to figure out how exactly to do it.

Seriously though, then what? What exactly do you mean by "controlling stake"? Let's say someone (tries to) buy up greater than 50% of all coins. Assuming such a thing is even possible, and that secrecy can be maintained during the process, what then?

Slowly, as currency crises pop up around the world, governments that might otherwise be able to "fix" the damage through fiscal policy means start to lose control, particularly over capital inflow/outflow. Eventually, a ring of bitcoin-"infected" nations in the Global South slowly start to encircle and encroach on the 5 fiat currencies mentioned above. And that's when the fun starts. :)

So who has permission to move the tokens on the decentralized ledger (which, let's say, is colored coins for the sake of argument)? Say I send my colored coin stock certificate from my address (connected to my real-world identity in the centralized ledger) to address X, which has no such connection. How does the centralized ledger now "know" who legally owns the stock certificate?

You can do some programmatic enforcement with "regular ole" bitcoin. Aspects like multisignature, time locks &amp; etc allow for some [smart contract]( implementation.
It's not quite as extensive as what is (theoretically) possible with Ethereum, but it's probably closer to implementation IMHO.

Yes I was going to recommend  but their SSL appears to be having problems at the moment...
Anyway, the idea here is that you print out a private key / address pair on a piece of paper, then store it securely (see the YouTube on the previous link). This way, if you do it right, the private key is never exposed to the internet in any way. Plus it's a fun craft project to put together the wallets. :)
If you're not into the whole paper thing, you can also buy a virgin flash drive, run the wallet generator offline, then save the public / private keys to the drive. That works too.
I mean let's keep it in perspective: If you bought on Circle, your coins are *probably* safe. But the point here is that you don't control the private keys, and that means you don't *really* control the bitcoin. If you're cool with that, then fine, but *please please please* make sure you at least have 2FA on both your Circle account *and* your email.

It's not that easy, no matter how much money you have.
Say they come up with CorpGovCoin. If it's not permissionless, it's basically just Square Cash / Google Wallet / any of the other digital cash systems that are already in existence. If it *is* permissionless, as is bitcoin, then it's basically just an altcoin. Sure they can market the hell out of it, but how are they going to bootstrap the mining network to be anything comparable to however many PetaFlops are now backing bitcoin?
They can try to perform a "bitcoin-ectomy" from the blockchain, but I'm confident that the patient will not survive.

Wow, amazing... First, I was unaware that Variety Jones had been outed.
Second, it's unfortunate that we don't have a lot of evidence to back up Variety Jones' claim of a corrupt FBI agent. Here is what he *should* have done: Supposedly "Diamond" verified that he was with the government by giving advance news of Mark Force's arrest to Jones. So Jones could have created a statement to the effect of "Carl Mark Force IV will be indicted for being a corrupt agent etc etc", hashed it and embedded it in the blockchain using Proof of Existence. Bam, instant proof.
Finally, it's a pretty good advertisement for multisig isn't it? If you're ever in a position with lots of BTC, find several people in different jurisdictions to become part of an M of N pool.

But in your hypothetical example you said that only 10 banks were allowed. Is the system open to the public or not? If it is then it's an altcoin.

This daemon then becomes the central signing authority, with obsoletes the purpose of proof of work.

OK guys... We're getting through! They still don't really understand why a permissioned blockchain won't work, it's not just some "kumbaya" about how open access is great... It's that without open access a blockchain is basically a slow database that wastes massive amounts of energy on proof-of-work that is *by its very nature unnecessary* since you're restricting access in the first place! If you have some internal authentication mechanism that  restricts access to the ledger, why do you have to even worry about digital signatures, proof of work or any of that?? Just use a google spreadsheet!
But at least they realize that there are detractors to the concept! I'll take that as a minor victory :)

I think there are subtle differences. What you're describing in your comment is basically the scientific method. The "mean jerk time" is engineering.
Here is the scientific method, parallel to what you describe: Start with hypothesis (1, your "statement"), identify logical ramifications of said hypothesis (2), design experiment to test said hypothesis (3), revise hypothesis (4), then repeat (5).
This is science, with its ultimate output being knowledge, i.e. your "statement". What the "mean jerk time" example illustrates is much closer to engineering, with its output being some sort of optimized process. You're focused on a particular question, i.e. "how many dudes can Erlich jerk off?" with a particular eye towards maximizing that number.
Now I recognize that there is a difference between computer science and software engineering here; but I guess my point here is that the line between science and engineering frequently gets blurred, and as a working scientist, this can be frustrating at times. When the output is a "thing" (program/solution/process/etc), it's engineering; when the output is knowledge, it's science.

OK, let's be positive... At least there is increasing recognition that while many banks are interested, only a few banks "get it." That's a good step!
However, unfortunately this author doesn't "get it." USB and Citi, who are planning their own custom blockchains, are ranked top of this list. The author clearly thinks that they are light years ahead of their competition because they're already working on their own bitcoin clones. The reality, as many readers of this sub know, is that the "permissioned blockchain" concept that they are developing is based on logical quicksand and doomed to failure.
Don't get me wrong, there is *massive* potential for financial institutions to build *on top* of the bitcoin blockchain. Colored coins, multisig and smart contracts could all be implemented today (or at least soon-ish) to gain massive efficiencies in a number of financial sectors.
But if you think you're going to build your own blockchain and have any hope of competing with the global decentralized permissionless network of bitcoin, *you're* the one who "doesn't get it."

... All of which use &amp; rely on bitcoin either directly or indirectly. If nothing else, colored coin tokens require (a) small amounts of bitcoin to generate, and (b) bitcoin to be spent on miners' fees. In a broader sense, the security of the bitcoin blockchain provided by the miners is 100% incentivized by the monetary value of bitcoin.
Moreover, it could be argued that smart contracts require "smart" money. The entire idea of a self-executing contract requires money to be sent given certain conditions to be met. Bitcoin (or cryptocurrency generally) is the only form of money that can be programmatically accessed in this way. Therefore, any major growth of smart contracts necessarily involves increased demand for BTC.

Sure, you can't just invest in the currency and expect the ecosystem to magically appear. But I think the smart investment is actually both.

I'm glad they at least got someone from the community to give *some* positive thoughts on bitcoin, but this piece came dangerously close to a mis-informed FUD hit piece. The hosts could have at least taken 1-2 minutes after bitcoin was introduced to go through some broad strokes of what it is and why it might be interesting. Instead, bitcoin stayed solely within the context of "weird digital money used by scary cybercriminals."

Well, sure, the non-confiscatability of bitcoin only translates so far into the physical world. Let's say "confiscation resistant." Ultimately, at the end of the day, any individual or business with a single physical address can be targeted and taken out.

2 concerns:
1. The technical details of this, which used to include Counterparty, are getting more vague rather than more specific over time. This is a bit concerning. The statement here is sounding suspiciously like the "blockchain w/o bitcoin" meme we've been seeing so much of recently:


2. Is this legal? I honestly don't know enough about how stock issuance works to answer the question. Anything even remotely bitcoin-like would have the feature that anyone, anywhere, regardless of nationality, criminality or SEC-filing status would be able to trade the token. Is this compatible with the way stocks work now? If I give a stock certificate to a guy in Papua New Guinea, does said guy now have the same rights as any other shareholder?

You know, this is kind of an ideal test case for a multisig insurance pool, whereby members running exit nodes could contribute to a sort of mutual defense fund.

If you're new to bitcoin, I would highly recommend [bitcoin.org's guide]( to get yourself up to speed. There are several wallets listed on the page that might work for you.
Personally, I haven't used multisig for my fund storage, but I hear [CoPay]( works fairly well. However, this isn't really the beginner option, so perhaps it isn't the best idea for you right now.
For small amounts I use blockchain.info's wallet feature, along with 2-factor authentication. There are android &amp; iOS versions available. I feel like this is relatively secure (assuming you also have 2FA on your email). For larger hodlings, offline storage is probably the best option, with something like either a Trezor, Mycellium Entropy, or a paper wallet.

Yeah I could see something like that taking place... The real question is, how many actual real-world applications will there be for a fully extensible protocol like Ethereum when "vanilla" bitcoin can do the job in many cases? One could make the argument that only 5-10% of tools in a toolbox get 90% of the work. *Most* of the time you're just using a flathead screwdriver &amp; hammer rather than that fancy orbital sander.
So in a world where multisig escrow, NLocktime, crowdsales &amp; whatever else are readily implemented in native bitcoin and handle 90+% of the smart contract needs, does Ethereum make a difference? I honestly don't know, only time will tell.

While I really like [Balaji's vision]( for society, this device still leaves me stumped.
If this is about IoT, why so expensive? I thought that the whole idea of IoT is that *cheap* computers get embedded in everything?
If this is about a secure hardware wallet, why is this better than Trezor/Keepkey/whatever?
If this is about a distributed marketplace, why do I need dedicated hardware for that?

The blockchain is a special kind of public database. It is the database used by the digital currency Bitcoin. The information about who made a work, who owns it and what the license terms are is stored in our own database, but it is also stored in the Bitcoin Blockchain. This helps provide an independent verification of the attribution and ownership information, so you stay in control of your intentions around your work. It also is part of the digital signature process that shows that a contract has been executed and a hand-off of rights has occurred. 


Soooo this relates to bitcoin *somehow*, but we aren't telling you how.

But what does mining accomplish here? Why not just have a shared database with each participating institution has access keys?

I agree with most of what you say in your post, but this is a bit much IMHO. I'm very interested in smart property, and we still have yet to see from the developer community some piece of dedicated hardware to act as a "lock" or electrical relay connecting the smart property (say, colored coin) token to the actual physical car / door / device.
As I see it, "software eating the world" is more of a reference to various institutional and/or corporate structures being subsumed into software products. E.g. accounting departments replaced by the spreadsheet, call centers replaced with automated phone trees, etc.

Sure, there's the whole Friendster/MySpace/Facebook sequence, and that could still happen.
But I would guess that if you looked at the actual adoption numbers we're at a very different space with bitcoin now, whether judged in terms of investment or # of users, then Friendster ever was (perhaps I'm wrong, I'd love to see the numbers). While something "better" could come along, again, I see nothing else gaining significant traction in the marketplace at the moment.
Also, there's mining. There is a large amount of security against double-spend already embedded into the bitcoin network. That contributes value to the coin, which then incentivizes miners, and establishes a sort of virtuous circle. This dynamic doesn't exist in social networks, whose power is driven *solely* be network effects.

Sure, I get that. So back to the early internet analogy: It's the mid-90's and, while the internet existed, you also had companies like AOL, Compuserve, and even Apple (e-World anyone?) saying "nuts to this public network, we're going to create our own product we can monetize." Of course, the concept was doomed and the internet won. 
But I suppose one could make the case that those companies invested in basic network &amp; human capital infrastructure that wound up being used to develop the global internet, so maybe it was a good thing.

This is Andreessen Horrowitz, the VC firm, BTW...
It's great that these guys have bitcoin on their radar, but to be frank, it frustrates me a bit how bitcoin still isn't part of the wider "startup" conversation, especially in areas like the sharing economy where it's an absolutely essential part of that sector's future. 
When listening to their other podcast about the sharing economy (few episodes before this one), they were talking about crowdfunding. At present, that *entire sector* can be replaced by a single open source program (Lighthouse). Any entrepreneur in the field needs to be asked point blank: Why would I use your service when I could set up a Lighthouse account and accept donations from anywhere in the world? What essential service does Kickstarter or Indiegogo provide that a smart contract cannot?

This is a bit of an exaggeration. If you're "attacking" an industry, you don't create a regulatory framework, however fragmented, to allow said industry to exist. In many ways, bitcoin is more acceptable to the federal government than (say) medical marijuana, for which there is no existing federal regulatory framework outside of "it's illegal." Compared to pot, the government is bending over backwards for bitcoin.
For an example of industries that the government *is* actually "attacking", take a look at [Operation Choke Point](

The fact that we can't immediately envision how a private-sector highway system might work does not in any way make it impossible or even improbable to exist.
Also, it's not necessarily a matter that is free of moral implications; how many people die on the highways every year?

How do we know that a private system wouldn't produce much fewer deaths?

OK, bad example. Let's use a better metaphor, that would seem to apply to many aspects of the medical industry: the mechanics shop.

Sure OK, that's a bit strong of a statement and not necessarily applicable in 100% of circumstances but I think it's broadly true to say that in competitive markets in which both producers and consumers can enter and leave with relative ease, better products are provided to consumers. This is the broad stroke of technological and societal development in the 20th century, the reason for Moore's law, the Green revolution in agriculture, etc.


Throughout human history we have "naturally" built a number of societal institutions that we have only recently, in the past 50-100 years, started to unwind... Chattel slavery, subjugation of women, etc. It's very dangerous to look at our current set of institutions, especially government which can preserve itself through violent force, and just assume "well this must serve some important social purpose, otherwise why would it be here?"

This is a potential solution to the much talked-about "intermittency problem" of renewable energy.

No, I don't know what they're working on. But as many people have pointed out in this forum, there are certain fundamental trade-offs that make the concept of a "private blockchain" tenuous. Who mines it, and what is their incentive? Without mining, what differentiates a "private blockchain" from a fancy Google Docs spreadsheet? We've had shared databases for 20 years, but a shared database is *not* a blockchain. Here's a handy guide: If you're not citing any novel aspect of Satoshi's whitepaper, than you're probably not working on a "blockchain."


And without them actually describing what they're working on, they aren't saying anything either. The fact that someone like Dimon, who sits at the top of this banking empire, is apparently technically clueless enough to suggest that the government could simply "ban" a distributed P2P technology doesn't give me high hopes that they've got a team of wizards working under cover who have somehow managed to overcome the fundamental logical problems I cited above.


Nobody knows, and that's the problem. I would strongly suggest the possibility that they don't know themselves, and this "private blockchain" thing is a massive exercise in "have your cake and eat it too."

Yes, which is why the US Federal government approach to BTC, while appearing relatively benign, is probably the most effective approach to try to control and steer it (at least in the near-term). An outright ban would produce a whole host of problems for the government, such as constitutional challenges as you mention, in addition to the fact that you'd probably have some public officials caught selling BTC right before the ban (a *la* South Korea), creating a scandal. Rather, they've created some kind of regulatory "box" in which bitcoin exchanges can operate. 
It's my belief that US federal law enforcement categorically does *not* want the question of "is code speech?" litigated in the supreme court, because the outcome would not be favorable for them.

Interesting notion, but a bit problematic... Democracy implies that there's a vote. Where do I get to vote on whether a transaction gets processed?
Some might see bitcoin as entirely *un*-democratic, and that this is (from an anarcho-libertarian perspective) actually a good thing. C.f. Cody Wilson for more details on this, but one of the core notions of modern democratic societies is that "we" decide, via our votes and/or elected representatives, what will and will not be allowed. Will there be guns or no guns? Drugs or no drugs? Call your congresscritter, write an op-ed, start a blog, etc... This is how you change the system.
Bitcoin says "nuts" to all that. Bitcoin doesn't care about your "national conversation," about your "democratic consensus." Bitcoin flips the Monetary Freedom switch to "On" and tears the breaker off the wall. Whether you see this as a good or bad thing, it's kind of un-democratic when you think about it.

What I think is interesting about this whole sordid saga is the difference between what passes for acceptable proof to the media, and what passes to us cypherpunks. For us, obviously, it's "sign with the genesis block private key or GTFO." It's a simple, elegant, reasonably foolproof, and Wright couldn't do it.
The press on the other hand is on a daily basis forced to make calls about real-world events based on far "noisier" information sources. E.g. Did Bashar Assad use barrel bombs in Syria? How many shooters were present in the Paris attacks (4 hours after the first reports)? In order to answer these questions, a mixture of "expert" witnesses, sketchy on-the-ground reports and other information have to be combined, and some editor makes a call.
In what is a (perhaps depressing) example of how long it takes the diffusion of technical knowledge to affect society, the ability to cryptographically sign a document is *still* an alien concept to most people.

Obligatory link to Balaji Srinivasan discussing these same topics: 
IMHO this is really the endgame for bitcoin. Cryptocurrency, once adopted on any reasonably large scale, makes 2 essential pillars of the modern democratic nation-state increasingly untenable: (1) mandatory, withholding-style taxation and (2) central bank-managed monetary policy.
Point (2) is mostly obvious for but Point (1) requires a little argument. I think it becomes clear once you look at the bigger trend in labor towards more P2P or "gig"-based economies. Withholding taxes work pretty well when the vast majority of taxpayers work for a limited number of large corporations because the State can effectively leverage power against those institutions. However, a more P2P-based economy, in which work is organized around gigs or projects becomes increasingly difficult to monitor (and thus tax).

I agree generally with you here as well.
Don't get me wrong, there are *huge* advantages to be gained by major financial institutions by either (a) building on top of bitcoin's blockchain in innovative ways, e.g. with colored coins, smart contracts, etc or (b) designing more innovative methods for federated e-cash servers, something like the OpenTransactions model.
I would argue that (b) is *not* "blockchain," but might nonetheless be an innovative use of digital currency, broadly speaking.
@_date: 2015-11-18 07:03:01
The speaker describes an alleged tension between the cryptoanarchist roots of bitcoin and the "silicon valley types" who want to use as bitcoin as the currency of the internet. I really don't see this as being the case. The kind of stuff Balaji Srinivasan is [talking about]( is a highly radical vision of a hyper-decentralized society. Bitcoin, in all of its stateless glory, is fully integrated and integral in this vision of the future.
The fact that VC's are funding companies that happen to be "playing by the rules" with AML/KYC etc is in no way evidence for some major tension. The *real* conflict is between the radical vision of bitcoin and the watered-down, co-opted "private blockchain" concept being pushed by Wall Street.
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:33:48
I think that you're missing a key element here, which is leverage. The specific scenario that's described [here]( is that the attacker takes out loans denominated in the foreign currency, with the expectation of major inflation in the future (along with deflation in bitcoin). This effectively inflates the foreign money supply, pushing its value down, thus increasing inflation expectations, and you then you have a feedback loop.

One very important aspect of a mathematical proof-of-work is easy verifiability. Once you find a block (i.e. the nonce that hashes to the proper target # of 0's), it's computationally trivial to verify that it's correct.
So let's take SETI How do you verify that the miners have actually performed the required computation? *Especially* now that they're rewarded with real-world value for their effort? What prevents them from gaming the system and spitting back a bunch of random information while claiming that they've performed the computation?

There are a lot of cool ideas on how to use the blockchain in innovative ways... [Smart contracts]( [smart loans &amp; collateral]( [global distributed crowdsales]( 
But I've never really found voting to be amongst them. The freedom inherent in the bitcoin protocol means that, by default, I would be able to sell my vote. Plus, who decides who gets to vote? How do you prevent against Sybill attacks? It seems like you still need some sort of identity &amp; permission apparatus, at which point what's the benefit of a distributed ledger in the first place?
We see the problems in this concept right away with this article's description of a blockchain:


It's more than that... But OK, continue...


Actually, that's *not* how it works because you're leaving out the crucial aspect of proof of work. If you *just* have a distributed ledger, anyone can double-spend. You need proof of work to ensure that only 1 version of the transaction history is dominant. Satoshi knew this in 2009, apparently Motherboard still doesn't get it in 2015.

I agree with the article's thesis is that bitcoin's biggest selling point is freedom, a brand message that resonates well with the average person.
We see now in the growing success of products such as Chase QuickPay, Google Wallet, Venmo &amp; etc that people want to be able to send money as easy as they send an email (or I guess a snapchat for the kids these days): click a button and it's done. Unfortunately, [as more people are beginning to realize]( the legacy banking system that underpins these apps doesn't care whether you see a little green checkmark and the words "money sent" on your iPhone screen. *They* have the final say on how the money moves, to whom, and whether or not it will be clawed back.
Bitcoin gives you *true* financial freedom from the screen of a smartphone. That irreversibility isn't a bug, it's a feature, and it's something people really do want.

There are some very interesting and unique implications for bitcoin-based bribery, particularly in the criminal justice system. Normally, a "criminal" who is brought to trial will have their assets frozen and/or confiscated, including presumably all of their cash / bank accounts. So bribery isn't really an option here, because there's no feasible scenario where the briber could pay the bribee, even if the former were to escape.
Now enter bitcoin. Assuming your bitcoin wallet is secured by a strong enough password, and you've backed it up an a secure location, the State can *never* get access to it, nor can they destroy it.

Well the main problem is that the concept has never been fully or even partially explained by its advocates.
How exactly does a "private blockchain" work? Where is the permissions layer applied? Is there mining? If so, what is the point when you already have a permissioned layer to decide who can &amp; cannot post entries to the ledger? If there is no mining, what distinguishes this from a Google Docs spreadsheet with a password?
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:59:23


I'd love to think that this is the case, but I think that this is a little optimistic. The underpinning of most financial regulation &amp; control is the notion that the government can directly monitor &amp; block major financial transactions. Bitcoin directly undercuts what is a major tool for a broad swath of law enforcement in a way they've never experienced before, and thus they are likely to react very harshly.
Look at all the howling we here now from LEO's over end-to-end encryption &amp; "going dark." What happens when the banking system "goes dark" for millions of Americans? They're not going to be pleased.


I agree with this. Bitcoin &amp; smart property will make money and a wide variety of electronic goods (including cars) essentially non-confiscatable. Land, however, is a different story. If there's one thing they know how to do, it's conquer a piece of land. (however I think that there will be creative work-arounds for this issue as well)

They aren't necessarily in competition. Facebook could, if they wanted to, simply add in BTC as another way to fund your "Facebook cash" or whatever this is.
What we're seeing here is a *front-end* e-cash system. BTC is more *back-end,* but the beautiful thing about it is how easily it could be integrated into any of these systems.
Just wait until Facebook's millions of non-US users, especially in countries without easy access to debit cards, start demanding this feature. Some engineer will say "gee why don't we just use bitcoin?", and it's just one API call away from integration.

"Scare quotes" over "Fintech" because it's a difficult field to define, let alone declare as "disruptive". 
"Fintech" as it is defined by the media appears to span everything between services that take the same rickety old payment rails and paint cute millennial-friendly apps on top of them (e.g. Venmo), genuinely innovative API-like platforms (Stripe, as featured in this piece), and *truly* disruptive cryptocurrencies that bypass the banking system entirely.
As such, the reportage in this piece was a little awkward for several reasons. First, the 20-something drop-out wunderkinds... I mean sure they seem smart &amp; capable, but *man alive* haven't we seen enough of this? Then there was Lesley Stahl, who alternated between "gee whiz" amazement and misplaced predictions that these cute little apps are going to somehow meaningfully disrupt the banking sector on which they still rely exclusively for their underlying financial plumbing.
So what's the fate of "fintech"? Many of these apps &amp; services will be easily and effortless swallowed up by the big banks. You can't "disrupt" your landlord while you're still paying him rent.
Bitcoin is the only truly disruptive technology mentioned in the piece, and it's a shame that it only received a throwaway line.

In a way the Trumpster is great because he takes many of the fundamental notions of the modern American nation-state, stretches them to their (frequently ugly) extreme, and presents them as a political platform.
Take immigration: What is the real, pragmatic, and rational basis for immigration restrictions? How do we *really* know, on the basis of quantitative economic or security considerations, how many Mexicans, Argentinians, Azerbaijanis, Mongolians, or whomever to let into the country each year? Is it 40? 4,000? 40,000? If there is a number, where does the number come from? Or, *perhaps,* the very notion of restrictions on immigration is at best a form of xenophobic economic protectionism, and at worst outright racism. Trump has (whether consciously or not) seized on this grain of irrationality at the heart of the modern Nation State, and has built it into a pearl of racist fear-mongering about "the other."
Same thing with monetary policy. We're expected to trust that some smart Pointdexters deep in the bowels of federal reserve are able to decide, *this month*, whether to print $20 billion, or $30 billion, or $40 billion, etc. So Trump goes: "Yeah, we'll just print 'da money!" Because that's essentially what we do anyways.

Perhaps, although it depends on the implementation. The simplest thing that comes to mind are issuing colored coin tokens that correspond to the "right to vote," which would then be irreversibly transferred once a vote took place.
However, the problem is that due to the permission-less nature of bitcoin, anyone could trade, sell or give away their "vote coins." Are "we" comfortable with this?
EDIT: as an anarchocapitalist i should state that i'm firmly ambivalent about the efficacy or "sanctity" of the democratic process as a whole, therefore the notion of buying or selling votes is not necessarily a deal-breaker. But my point is that you can't necessarily meld a permission-based system (voting, who gets to vote and what they do with their vote) with an inherently permission-less system (bitcoin).

Except normally, Bitcoin is precisely *not* a prominent example. It's Venmo or Transferwise or Stripe, and if bitcoin's mentioned at all it's playing 2nd fiddle to these other "disruptive technologies."
IMHO fintech is so ill-defined as to border on meaningless. Mostly it seems to be painting a cute, shiny millennial-friendly veneer on top of the same old rickety bank-owned payment rails. The notion that non-bitcoin "fintech" is in any way "disruptive" to the big banks is a farce.

It's news because this is "the competition," in a manner of speaking.
The value proposition that was offered multiple times in the piece, namely the ability to send money effortlessly, with the click of a button, just like we send an email; this is actually something their cute apps and API's *cannot provide*, for precisely the reason that they still utilize the same bank-based payment rails that they (ironically) claim to disrupt.
Stated another way: when you click the "Send" button on your cute millennial-friendly Venmo app, your money does not "go through the internet like an email" in any meaningful sense. It goes through the same old rickety payment rails that everyone else's money goes through, and just like everyone else's money, it's subject to freeze, revocation, cancellation &amp; expropriation by a small army of compliance officers.
So yes, pieces like this are very important for the future of bitcoin. They present the problem, and an imperfect solution. Only bitcoin offers the value proposition they describe in the piece.

While I agree that what they are actually talking about when they say "blockchain" is "enterprise-level database," if they were smart they would realize that there are huge benefits to using existing bitcoin 2.0 technologies for various business processes.
Colored coins, for instance, are a cheap &amp; convenient way to record bond issuance &amp; allow those bonds to be traded in an open marketplace *without* requiring a centralized clearing house. Of course, if the bank itself is the central clearing house, then they're not so happy about losing their privileged position.

I wonder if this becomes any easier or harder if on the last mile, instead of converting into local currency, you convert into some kind of digital gift card (e.g. cell phone minutes). This might actually be a selling point, in that those in developed countries remitting back home might want that money to be "earmarked" for specific purposes like (say) groceries or home supplies.
The theory here is that the corporations that manage the gift cards would probably be easier to transact with than a developing country's banking system.

To say that I cannot imagine a particular business model in which the modern conveniences that we now enjoy could have been developed without the same level of debt-based financing that existed in the 20's does not prove that those advances could not have been arrived at lower levels of debt.

And yet amazingly, people still transact in cash. Do you use a credit card at Starbucks so that in the 0.000000 (10 more zeros) 001% chance that the barista turns around, tosses the hot coffee in your face and say "how do you like your latte now *bitch*?", I can at least call Visa/Mastercard and have them reverse the transaction? Or do you use a credit card because you don't want to have to shlep to the ATM every other day?
Let's face it, for the *average* consumer transaction reversibility is *incredibly* low on the list of things you need in a payment system. If I buy a shirt from Target and later regret it, I'm going to return it to Target. I'm not going to dispute the transaction through Visa.
OK sure it's important if your credit card gets stolen, but that's a problem with *the very nature of credit card transactions themselves* that bitcoin solves completely.

I certainly don't think that it would be a *smart* strategy to be against bitcoin, or to try to perform some sort of boneheaded "bitcoin-ectomy" from the blockchain. But it really depends on how they structure their business strategy. Someone at the top could be thinking, "well of *course* we'd create our own digital currency, we *have* to be able to control it!"


I agree 100%, but Intel's actions depends on how they view "take a swath." Do they think that market share means something that they exclusively control, i.e. have IP over? Or do they think that becoming a major player in a space can happen even without IP control? I guess the question boils down to what is their position on working within an open-source ecosystem, and how do they try to capture value within it?

Look, bitcoin is a fundamentally libertarian idea. You're responsible for your own security, in the same way that you're responsible for your own computer security. You can *delegate* security to other individuals... In our traditional financial systems, those other individuals have been the government. Bitcoin allows the potential for other institutions to do the same (Coinbase, multisig wallets, etc). The usability of these services is improving every day.
But if you're telling me that people will just never adapt to better IT security practices, well, they either will or they'll get hacked and learn their lesson. And besides, "they," by which presumably you mean older people, aren't the future anyways. Snapchat didn't get a $billion+ valuation for making a product for old people.

So let's return to the premise of this thread, that bitcoin is the primary currency. People pay for their Starbucks with bitcoin. Even assuming a future in which people use Apple/Android pay, this system can easily be switched from a credit card backend to a bitcoin backend.
All various credit instruments, all can be provided in some way by bitcoin (along with [scripting commands]( already embedded in the protocol) and/or more advanced smart contract languages.


What, you mean I pay "a guy" to "manage" my retirement fund? People are already realizing that this is a scam and switching to index funds.
Plus, a world with mass bitcoin adoption would also include cryptographic stocks, bonds, and a variety of other instruments that will rival the complexity of what we have today. All without "a bank."
The real question is, how do banks continue to exist when (assuming again the original premise) depositors start leaving in droves and converting their $'s bitcoin? What pays Jamie Dimon's salary when he's got $3.50 under administration?

What's much more likely to me is that given the corruption surrounding the case the prosecution made a tactical decision not to proceed with charging murder-for-hire, as this would have to be prosecuted in Maryland where those corrupt agents were based, etc. However that doesn't change any of what are the apparent facts, that (a) our homeboy here was caught with a laptop open with the SR admin page logged in, and (b) said laptop had diaries and chat logs where he literally confessed to paying to torture and murder people.

Thankfully there were some attempts here at asking the tough questions about the so-called "private blockchain" concept, but the responses by Adam Ludwin illustrate the intellectual void at the center of this idea.
The basic problem with "blockchain without bitcoin" is that the proponents aren't providing any technical details (even so much as a cocktail napkin sketch) of how this technology would actually work, and furthermore what distinguishes it from a simple database with permissions.
The core misunderstanding is evident in Ludwin's description of what makes the blockchain unique. His description was (and I'm paraphrasing): "Blockchains are a unique type of database in which the individual entries are owned, rather than the entire database being owned." This because of the fact that a private key is necessary to move a bitcoin from address A to address B.
However, this definition is *incomplete* and *unworkable* without proof-of-work, and Satoshi knew this in 2009. If you just have a blockchain without proof of work, double-spends are trivial. If I have the private key, I can authorize a transaction to Alice, then I can immediately authorize a transaction to Bob. Which one is valid? Who knows?
Proof of work *uniquely* ensures that there is only 1 version of the transaction history that remains inviolate. What are these people proposing as an alternative? It's one big shrug, "?????"
This is the [underpants gnomes]( folks. Don't fall for it.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:38:51
Wow this is really a biased and one-sided presentation of the issues. Several of these points are simply not true ("raw transactions"? sweeping of funds from paper wallets can be done easily with mobile wallets, no need to construct a "raw transaction"), and others suffer from the "Nirvana fallacy."
A serious attempt at this would, in a *point-by-point* fashion, compare the strengths and weaknesses of a paper wallet strategy to a *realistic alternative*, i.e. a hardware wallet.
One problem becomes immediately apparent: all hardware wallets are made by centralized companies in such a way where there could easily be backdoors either intentionally produced by the company (say, because of a national security letter or whatever), or they could be altered in transit. At least with a paper wallet you can download the code directly from Github and know exactly what you're getting.
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:14:30


Soooo now you have a scenario where the user is required to keep an entirely separate offline computer as "their bitcoin," which would presumably also be their only copy. EDIT: at least with paper multiple copies could easily be created at the time of generation.
This creates a situation of *greater* vulnerability than paper to environmental compromise, as you illustrated with the "scare picture" of water-damaged paper wallets on the bitcoin wiki page. Not only will this computer need to be kept safe from water, fire, and everything else, but it will also be vulnerable to EM radiation and possibly magnetic fields in a way that paper is not.
In addition, the computer will probably need to be booted up or at least charged up every once in a while. This creates a potential attack surface which is at *least* as large as that of a printer, and possibly greater because as part of a well-executed paper wallet strategy one could intentionally destroy a printer after use.

First of all, I like the design bitcoinpaperwallet.com better, but that's just my opinion.
I think that your method is reasonably secure, download the paper wallet generator, disconnect the network (from both your computer *and* your printer) and run it locally. This protects you against any malicious program that directly monitors your screen in real-time.
It wouldn't necessarily protect your BIP38 password against a keylogger that was smart enough to send its data in batches rather than real-time. Then again, IMHO the security model of the paper wallet shouldn't be overly dependent on the BIP38 password; it's dependent on the private key being securely stored offline.
Also, at  you can get an Ubuntu LiveCD with the generator pre-installed if you'd like to do the CleanOS route. But honestly, if you're that concerned about sophisticated remote monitoring tools on your device you probably have bigger problems to address than securing your bitcoin (just my $0.02.)

But Ulbricht is at best a complicated figure. Perhaps we'll never know the full story, but personally I'm apt to believe a narrative in which he started off as an idealist but became corrupted by the power he acquired.

Seriously. Bitcoin is a revolutionary new technology, and as such it will be used for both good *and* evil. We shouldn't brush off these murder-for-hire allegations. Sure, it seems like a convenient "puppy-kick" moment, because otherwise Ulbricht would really have been morally in the clear from a libertarian perspective. But that doesn't prove that they were fabricated.
So for all those who are saying that this isn't real, where are the transcripts from? The government planted them? Did Karpeles go down the chimney one night and sneak them onto Ulbricht's laptop while he slept?

A few things: First, this was a pretty decent interview. They hit all the major points, e.g. how would you even regulate this, wouldn't this also force the regulation of Zynga bucks, etc.
And quite frankly, the fact that regulators are "looking at this" is not necessarily scary (yet). Nobody's seriously talking about banning BTC, which brings a whole can of worms from both a technical and legal standpoint. IMO the most likely thing to come out of this is more regulations on the exchanges. But considering how fast government moves, *especially* when there's no crisis involved, I wouldn't bet on seeing anything concrete for another year *minimum*.

1. For over the counter transactions, BTC is still a bit clunky, so access to PayPal as an escrow-type service could really speed up adoption by merchants.
2. PayPal can't stop anyone from using their own private addresses to send BTC to whomever they please over the Internet. I suppose they could hobble their own online wallet function... That's up to how they implement it.
3. "Strangle the competition"... How exactly? People will use PayPal/BTC only as long as it is useful to them. They can't stop the BTC protocol any more than a government could at this point.

Wrong idea IMHO. Begging for your freedom never works. DC will want "compromise," and then before you know it the Bitcoin Foundation or whoever is the appointed "groveler" will be coming back saying "guys come on grow up we really need to fork the protocol to get rid of this anonymity thing..."
We need to make the system resilient enough to survive any attack. The BTC protocol as it is is already pretty good... It's the exchange functions that need work.
Here's what needs to happen: Robust exchanges between BTC and other corporate-supported virtual currencies, i.e. Amazon coins, Linden dollars, WoW gold, etc. (Are airline miles trade-able?) Establish the statutory equivalence between these and BTC via robust exchange functions. Then force the government to shut *all* of these things or *none* of them.
Basically, we need to force the government to try to ban *all* virtual goods online, thus creating a tripwire for the rest of Reddit (and the EFF, etc) to get involved.

No, it isn't inflation, because none of the alt-currencies affect the supply of Bitcoin. I can create "X-coin" where mining happens on a CPU at a rate of 1000's of X-coins per second, but all the means is that the value of X-coins plummets to near 0, while the value of Bitcoin is unaffected.

Class, this is Keynsianism, in case you were wondering.
So if inflation drives growth, shouldn't Ben Bernanke do what he's always threatened and drop bales of dollars out of helicopters? By jove, if only the government inflated more, we'd have starships and warp speed by now!  /s
Here's the Austrian take: Economic growth is driven by real savings invested by entrepreneurs in an environment in which the interest rate properly transmits information about the time value of money. These savings, and thus the economic growth they support, are *directly* damaged by inflation. Further, central bank activities to suppress the interest rate disrupt this important price signal to entrepreneurs.
We don't need the phony "growth" that comes from money printing. Humanity advanced without fiat currency, and it will advance even faster once we've moved beyond it.

Honestly, banning transactions in BTC would be a hugely unprecedented increase in state power that would be met with some resistance. It would be like banning transactions in gold.

Yeah this moves us to the general debate about fiat currencies vs "sound" money (including both gold and BTC for the purpose of this discussion).
Obviously the pro-inflation argument is what's "won the world" at this moment in history... But I guess the counterpoint is, if inflation is so great, why not more of it? Why don't they just drop money out of helicopters?
Then there's the goldilocks answer... Hey, we're not saying print money indefinitely, but *just* enough to spur economic growth. OK, so who decides when it's just enough? How do they (i.e. the Ben Bernank) know how much is *just* enough? And how do they keep it from spiraling out of control when they realize, oops, we printed *way* too much (which is the situation that many Austrians say we are in now)?
All these question need answers from pro-inflation folks. If The Ben Bernank is so wise and powerful, why can't he just run the entire economy himself? If he isn't, then isn't it *incredibly* dangerous to be entrusting the underpinning of our entire financial system to one entity?

I never really understood this argument. Deflation (in prices) has a lower  bound, whereas runaway (hyper)inflation does not.
If house prices somehow drop to, say $20, then *everyone* buys a house, supply drops, and prices go back to normal equilibrium. If on the other hand hyperinflation takes place, home prices start rising at uncontrolled rates, the government keeps pumping out more money, prices go up, etc. You get into a feedback loop.
@_date: 2013-04-29 03:50:41
Completely disagree, this is *exactly* what BTC needs right now. We need strong and robust currency exchanges between BTC and every trade-able in-game currency that exists.
Why? Because then in the eyes of the law, BTC becomes the equivalent if Linden dollars, or WoW gold, or IMVU whatever-it-is, &amp; etc &amp; etc. So now, when they try to shut down Mt. Gox, they will have to go after every other virtual currency in existence. We bitcoin enthusiasts are few... But how many people play WoW?

It's a crisis. There's no (or very little) food on the shelves. What good are food stamps? I mean, it's fine if you're saying that the government should just airdrop in food... But the point is that the government doesn't necessarily know *what's needed* on a day-to-day basis. The market "knows" in a way that government never can.

How would this be enforced? There are thousands of people that pay for goods/services with cash, how would the government know whether cash transactions were occurring or Bitcoin? Surveillance cameras in all those NYC bars accepting BTC?


This is the more interesting and realizable scenario. However, it's important to point out that this would require the banning of *all* online currencies, including WoW gold, linden dollars etc for legal consistency and enforceability. Otherwise, it would be like the government banning McDonalds and not any other fast food restaurant.


Considering the fact that drug use rates have not been significantly impacted, and marijuana legalization measures are gaining steam across the country, I would say that if the stated goal of the War on Drugs is the elimination of drugs from society then it's been a dismal failure. Since we're talking about the government trying to stamp out BTC, the same logic applies.

Yes, the last comment (Ravikant) is the most far-reaching. Digital gold is great, but what about wills, futures contracts, or a whole host of other financial instruments? These are some of the ideas [Open Transactions]( seem to be advancing. An entire financial system outside of the control or influence of any single controlling entity... That's quite a future to imagine.

I'm not going to be popular with this comment, but quite frankly I can't help but hear a little "Chicken Little" in these concerns.
At the end of the day, all that we're talking about here is **data**. What individuals, companies or nations decide to then do with that data is a separate issue. I as an individual with my bitcoin wallet can still choose to accept any coin from anywhere regardless of what "taint" that bitcoin does or does not have. In many cases, this information could actually be useful for freedom-abiding folks. For instance, perhaps if I knew that I was acquiring coins that had been taken from the Dread Pirate Roberts during the Silk Road raid, I might simply choose to forward those back to his legal defense fund, or perhaps donate to the "new" DPR.
For all those who are so upset about this development, what exactly do you propose? *"No data analysis on the blockchain shall take place, ever?"* Sorry. If what you're looking for is truly untraceable digital money, work on implementing something like Open Transactions with Chaumian e-cash. Bitcoin just isn't meant to work this way.

Thanks. Perhaps I phrased the title poorly. Nonetheless, the point still stands (I think) that the infrastructure to do these things is already present in the current protocol. Client-side software just needs to be written to implement these functions.
@_date: 2013-05-31 00:05:59


This would be fairly unprecedented, and would be met with some serious resistance from more powerful civil rights advocates like the ACLU and/or EFF. This is basically the criminalization of software without any sort of precedent or clear and present societal danger (terrorism/CP/etc).
Look, I'm not saying that the government behaves in any moral fashion, but there is still a balance with the consent of the governed. As an example, they "could" just start rounding everyone up and putting them into camps, but this would be faced with major resistance from *everyone*, not just us crazy libertarian types. There's a balance that even they have to strike.
EDIT: removed some unnecessary sarcasm :)

How exactly? It would seem as though the FinCEN guidelines treat bitcoin as any other form of money in that they require standard AML/KYC for exchanges.
To be honest, if there are big ramifications for this ruling, I'm missing them (perhaps someone else could fill me in). It would seem as though the general consensus of US regulations has been basically to say "yes, this is just like any other form of money."

The thing is, he made a big splash with Defense Distributed, which was a pretty novel concept. Unfortunately, a bitcoin wallet at this stage in the game seems to be a bit of "me too." What's going on with the 3D printing stuff? I remember him saying that he was going to try to go after patented medical devices, whatever happened to that?
He probably has good answers to all these questions, which just proves your point... needs better messaging!

I think focusing on the fact that some of these proposals use Ripple is missing the forest for the trees. The development of these sort of decentralized P2P insurance systems is a huge and important step towards "[an-capistan]( Of course, there are some major issues that still need to be worked out, but the potential here is to create *open-source software that would function as an insurance company.* IMHO, that's the important thing to discuss here.
The three things that are necessary for an insurance system are a mechanism for safely pooling the funds of the insured, verifying claims, and disbursing funds when claims occur. Bitcoin handles the 1st and 3rd requirement easily. It's the 2nd, the verification of claims, that's problematic. However, if the software could somehow use either trusted 3rd party and/or publicly verifiable data in order to make its decisions about fund disbursement, then you could effectively remove the human element completely.
Just to think of an example, something like [crop-hail insurance]( could function in this way. By using publicly available weather data and correlating that to location data of the insured, the system would automatically pay out those affected after certain weather events took place. It seems to me like there's huge potential here...

Anarchism (ancap) in no way requires individuals to somehow magically become "good." There are evil people in the world now, and many of the truly worst (i.e. sociopathic tendencies) tend to be attracted towards positions having the maximum amount of power over other people, i.e., government.
Anarcho-capitalism is simply saying, let's "distribute" the evil in the world and force it to exist in a free-market context where it can be "out-bid" by the majority (99.9%+) who aren't evil. Essentially, it's a P2P argument, if you will. Bad actors are forced out of the network.
Also, "do you fully understand the results of the anarchy that you suggest"? Do you have a prediction here, with 100% certainty of what would result from a stateless society?

It's important to understand that the explanation offered above is an example of Keynesian/neoclassical macroeconomic theory. Another explanation offered by the Austrian economic theory is exactly the opposite, namely that inflation caused by central banks is precisely the cause of large economic booms and busts. This happens because the crucial mechanism of interest rate, that signal the time value of money and the total savings available for investment in the economy, is disrupted by the actions of the central bank.
An important question to ask any proponent of central banking is, how does the government know what the interest rate "should" be, and how do the actions taken to set such an interest rate (which are effectively a price control) not produce massive disruptions in the structure of production? In other words, if it's the government's job to dump a bunch of free money into the economy, why shouldn't we expect this to lead to bubbles (i.e. housing) in which significant economic miscalculations are made that lead to massive overproduction of goods?


The ability to simply print money at will does *not* create wealth. If this were the case, then Zimbabwe would be the captain of the world. Wealth is created by savings, originating from profits, which are invested.

I'm going to attempt to walk through a "colored coin" transaction to see if I understand it. You folks correct me if I'm wrong.
I agree to buy 1 share in CryptoWidget Inc for 1 BTC. I pay 1 BTC, and then receive back some amount of BTC that has been "colored" to represent my 1 share. This colored coin then sits in my address, presumably with all my other BTC.
So I'm guessing that the information about what BTC is colored is stored in the blockchain on a "per-transaction" basis, so as to prevent double-color-spending. So as a consequence, if you receive a colored coin and then spend the corresponding BTC without knowing it (or without caring), that amount of "color" is lost forever, right?

Nobody's "mandating" anything, nor would anything be mandated. Afraid of the government? They would have *just as much* power/authority/gumption to attack bitcoin *with our without* any "redlist." That's not what's stopping them.
We're back to the same question that we've always had whenever anyone talks about the gov't shutting down bitcoin? *How would they do it?* Shut down the internet?
The fact that a coin-tainting scheme might or might not add additional justification for the gov't to attack bitcoin, which is in and of itself debatable, does nothing to address the crucial "How?" question that we've had forever. Shut down all exchanges? Pressure businesses not to accept it? OK, why aren't they doing that already, and what would "coin tainting" change to make them do so?

Do they produce and sell the food? If not, then your statement "Multiple integrated and co-dependent organizations etc etc are government" is incorrect, because that designation would apply to any set of market actors.


What specifically are we talking about here? Because the river Thames was polluted before parcels of the river could be sold off to private owners, thereby creating liability for anyone who polluted. Pollution happens by and large on *public* property, because private owners won't tolerate the dumping of waste on their own property.


Again, nobody owns the oceans. There's the problem. Or are you proposing world government for the oceans?


EDIT: Prove that government is the most effective way to deal with the problem of pollution, as aside from market forces.

I hear plenty of impassioned argument here over why the powers that be will not allow BTC to exist after 3-5 years. What your post lacks is specifics for *how* they would actually do anything about it. I could see if they could squash Mt. Gox *now* it might have a strong effect, but by a few years time there will be a solution to the exchange problem. So how will this "ban" work? And for bonus points, how would this be effective where the war on drugs (another government "ban") has been a dismal failure?

K, so how does it work? Say I want to buy BTC's with fiat. To whom do I send my money, and how?

Can you expand on that? I'm not a developer, but from reading the language in the "Theory" section as well as listening to some talks from Mike Hearn, it seems as though these are features in the core bitcoin protocol that simply aren't utilized to large extent by various clients. Specifically, the methodology that is described in the [Theory]( section uses SIGHASH flags and the like to control the behavior of the transaction.

There has to be a system to verify claims that relies on either publicly available or trusted 3rd party data.

This. Look at the actual statements from regulators (FinCen, CFTF, etc). These are bureaucrats looking to determine (a) how the laws on the books apply and (b) who's breaking them. Bitcoin could very well be *the* existential threat to the modern nation state, but these guys wouldn't know and don't care. That's above their pay grade.
What both libertarians and non-libertarians alike need to realize is that the government is just a collection of people doing "their job."

How so? "Black markets" are only necessary because the government criminalizes certain economic activity between consenting adults.

Well I for one think this is a big positive. As for the naysayers here, I have a hard time reading any coherent criticism of BTC adoption by PayPal, other than "OMG PayPal sux amirite???" Seriously, what are you worried about? They'll "corner the market"? So what they're going to invest in mining hardware now?
They can't kill BTC anymore than any government could at this point, all they can do is compete with services like BitPay to make it *far* easier to buy things with BTC. In that way, they add "exchange-like" functions to a market that sorely needs a replacement to Mt Gox.
Besides, it was in PayPals DNA from the very beginning to become the stateless currency of the Internet... Obviously they've strayed from that initial vision over the years, but kudos to them for recognizing that their founding goal was achieved by Satoshi and jumping on the chance to push t forward.
