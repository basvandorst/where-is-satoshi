I think it is because Coinbase is still not segwit.

Hey, I made two transfers but I can not see it on blockchain. Why is that ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:38:58
Well, you start next month. Our HR will contact you with further details.

Hey ,thanks for the information. Though , I am not sure if bitcoin transactions can be rolled back. I mean I have read earlier in several places that it can't be.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:40:54
So, why some sellers/buyers require a certain number of confirmations before they accept the payment?

Now, what can you do with 13 BTC? It is around 195000 USD. I suggest you seek out businesses where you can invest some amount, probably a good startup? a project in which you believe in? You can also invest in Mutual funds so your holdings also grow in fiat currency and HODL rest of the BTC.  
Total investment suggested 2-4 BTC. 
HODL rest of the amount.

So what do you suggest?

Only problem with selling and buying bitcoin is the cost. Sometimes its not even worth it.

How to use RBF? Any guide ?

Start buying weekly. 300 dollars weekly would give you a good investment. Also get verified to increase your limit.

It is not FUD. Usually people relate black friday and bitcoin with when bitcoin went from 1000 to 300.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:49:12
Good that you do. I thought that you didn't know. You make us hodlers proud ;)

Did you read the article or just the headline?
Here is excerpt from it -
The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reports that JPM is considering whether to provide its clients access to CME’s new bitcoin product through its futures-brokerage unit.

Regarding your BCH, did your hardware wallet not support the fork ? Because it is possible that you have this huge amount of BCH. Wouldn't hurt to check ? If it's alot , feel free to send some my way ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:05:50
To cut your losses, try to get some BCH and BTG - 9 exactly and convert them to BTC. 
For god's sake, use electrum or coinomi if you wish to use app or web wallet
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:33:58
I am more than happy if it reaches even 20k or 200k. Just worried about the correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:46:19
Yes, it is very good movie.

Yes, but I think a lot of people do not use core wallet and store it on other wallets.

I understand what you mean and in one way it make sense to buy a bitcoin when prices are low. 
I would probably do it next time the prices go low, which most probably might considering the Segwit. 
I do not want to spend say a huge amount at once because of two reasons 
1. Too much risk (possibly) 
2. Not enough money to spare. 
Already spent 600-700 USD on crypto this month across 6-8 currencies. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:21:01
My initial plan was to spend 20 - 30 EUR per week across crypto currencies. I own some bitcoin but not a lot. So, no point selling it at this point, all I am thinking is if I should continue my strategy of buying each week or not.
