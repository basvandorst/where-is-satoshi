“I mean I was at work the other day and I saw the price was over $400,” says social media editor for Yahoo Eric Stortz “I went right to the office bathroom and squirted one right in the stall.”

That would mean GPB is increasing too because BTC has dropped vs that too.!

Thanks for writing so much just for me. I'm glad I touched a nerve. 
Muslims exclude everyone else in the world and actively work against us. They can fuck right off and that will not change while it's 'the brothers' vs 'everyone else'.
Don't post things about fascist hate death cults.

If you choose to accept bitcoin the costs for you to implement it as a payment option are virtually nil. i'm sure your employee would be able to help too.
It is likely that you wouldn't get many (if any) customers paying with bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently in a stage where it requires further evangelism from those who believe in it's worth as a technology and a currency. On the other side of this, you may obtain new business from bitcoin users simply for making it available as a method of payment. Ultimately if you choose not to accept bitcoin, you will never have a customer pay with it. If you wanted to gauge it's viability (and let people know you may accept it) you could create posts on local forums asking the people in your area whether they would be ok with using it for your specific service, for example.
Bitcoin is a digital currency based upon a technology known as the blockchain. You could suggest that the blockchain is like a payment processor, which is not entirely accurate but helps simplify the explanation and allows new users to better relate. The hardest part of this process I believe is getting the users to first buy bitcoin to then pay you with them. To somebody new this could appear to be a little hassle.
To pay with bitcoin both you and the customer need a wallet. You can use a third party hosted wallet get one on blockchain.info or coinbase.com or you can download the software to run a wallet on your computer. There are risks associated with both of these methods that you should look into. Specifically, with a hosted solution they could lose your coins, get hacked or just vanish without a trace. If use a software wallet you should look into either exchanging the bitcoin into fiat straightaway or storing the bitcoins on an offline computer using a method known as cold storage.
Once the customer has a wallet they need to obtain some bitcoins to fill it with. This process can be comparable to adding money to a paypal account. To obtain bitcoins they need to visit an exchange and buy some with fiat. bittylicious.com, coinbase.com or some other user recommended option can help there.
Upon buying their coins and having them in their wallet, they need to make the payment to you. This is done by creating a payment, entering the amount (in bitcoins), the address to send them to (your wallets address) and clicking send. A transaction can be accepted almost immediately, however, the transaction will not be verified until the next bitcoin block has been mined - on average this takes about 10 minutes. For more information on this see: 
There are mobile apps available to make the transaction as quick and easy as possible. I can't offer much help with those though.
You will need to get some professional advice to be sure. Legislation is quite sparse and very likely to change, it's a space you would have to watch if you were accepting bitcoin. As far as I am aware bitcoin is currently considered as an asset by the UK. It could be worth reading the following:

The vast majority of nazi's were just ordinary people too. Although, if you believe in sharia (which *is* the majority!) are you still ordinary?

I believe there is a list of blacklisted addresses that could be implemented for rejected by the blockchain. There was an attempt by a developer to fork a version containing this although it was rejected by the mining community.
Somebody else had the same thought as you it seems, plenty of comments there regarding the issue:

I setup something a *long* time ago. The basic setup was an IRCD and the PJIRC java client embedded to a page. Worked just fine.
I'm sure there is a better, quicker and easier solution available nowadays though.

Thanks for the tip! 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-21 14:04:24
I'll vouch for these, transfer is quick and there is little fuss. There is a limited amount of bitcoin that you can buy until you have performed a number of transactions with them. The limit increases each time you buy bitcoin.

So you post this because bitcoin is sharia compliant. 
Do you like the other parts of sharia that, specifically and in detail, subjugate all non muslims and women?

Ah right. I think you can get re-education nowadays to help you with your racism. While there, they may also be able to assist you with your narrow and stereotypical view of people.
