These statements not only apply to Bitcoin and world currencies, but also Bitcoin vs other cryptocoins. A Litecoin/Bitcoin scenario fits perfectly into his description.

As this product matures, I'd love to see it incorporate realtime data from the big security exchanges.

I'm not quite sure why are counts are off in some places. It follows the same comparator rules as yours.... Anyways, if anyone has any idea where to get a list of "negative" and "positive" words etc. that'd be awesome.

An interesting idea is a "game" in which people place coin deposits around the city and others can find them, much like this. Also the developer could place advertisements in their augmented reality, and they could use these funds to sponsor "coin drops" (Sponsored coin deposits around the city). This "game" could be really utilized as an advertising tool.
