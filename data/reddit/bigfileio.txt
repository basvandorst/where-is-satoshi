I did have a look at the WP and seen that Facebook and all the others can not control your data when the GDRP would come out. 
So it is Time to gear up and get ready to Party.
after you read this, you will understand more about it:

Think of it like a Data pool that lets you share your data on the blockchain and actually give you the means to control how Data Management Platforms use that data, the most amazing part is that you get part of the revenue that the campaign would generate

New data ecosystem for the AdTech industry by developing a data trading foundation on the blockchain that lets you share your data in a safe way, so your data is anonymously distributed to the advertiser. there are several ways to do so. 
so the data is targeted and not you as a person panikjmp.

Tanks Buddy, I am investing in several TGE's and this one is close to my heart, I believe we change the way huge companies use our data for free and without our knowledge.
That’s why we need to reclaim our data and change the world.
You got to love blockchain

The  states that as of May 2018, the user is the rightful owner of his or her personal information. All online businesses collecting user data must make a copy available, free of charge, in an electronic format. This essentially means that the data that is so critical to the multi-billion-dollar advertising industry, which is projected to grow by 16.5% in 2018 alone, belongs to you.
Lucky we have the Blockchain and Liberdy.io to help us get it back and get rewarded for our data!

Long live the blockchain revolution!
