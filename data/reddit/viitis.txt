You can try child pays parent, meaning sending the coins to other address you controll with high fee. Depending on you wallet this can be easy or hard

Bitcoin address is a hash of a public key plus some other info. Public keys are only revealed when you spend coins.

No we don't. EU is not a single country with one unified system. Here in northern europe we use spaces instead of dots.

Kraken and Bitstamp are better exchanges when buying in euros. They support SEPA and fees are a fraction of what Coinbase charges.

NiceHash doesn't mine Bitcoin. It mines the most profitable coin and converts income to Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:06:00
That is already widely used, so yes it is possible to implement it to our daily lives.

Could you elaborate what you mean? Bitcoin doesn't use encryption and there is no "Bitcoin Encryption". What security techniques in particular you are referring to?

It is a lottery to find a sha256 output that is under current target value. [Here]( is a good but long explanation of it.

There is nothing secret about the r value, it's a part of the published signature. Did you mean the [k value]( that needs to be secret and random.

I doubt there are any large scale bitcoin-PayPal transfers. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 09:15:47
Yes, if someone has access to your seed (13 word list) they have access to all Bitcoins stored in that wallet. 
You should be able to restore your wallet with all other wallets following the same standard. 
There is no passwords saved on the blockchain, there are locks and you have the keys to open them.

You got the fee part wrong, quote from GDAX [webpage](
"When you place an order at the market price that gets filled immediately, you are considered a taker and will pay a fee between 0.10% and 0.25% for BTC books and 0.10% and 0.30% for ETH books.
When you place an order which is not immediately matched by an existing order, that order is placed on the order book. If another customer places an order that matches yours, you are considered the maker and your fee will be 0%."
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:32:13
Actually most European countries use space as a thousand separator not a dot.


@_date: 2017-09-01 08:28:54
I didn't mean the numbers. Limit order doesn't mean you are maker. If your order is filled immediately, you are considered taker regarless of order type.

You don't enter your bank details, they get them from the deposit. The name in the deposit must match the name you have given.

I heard that the problem was people using Bitcoin to buy multiple copies and selling them for profit on gray market sites.
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:44:35
That is what they want you to think. In reality it is a FED run shit coin.
@_date: 2016-10-12 07:36:02
No. When network process the transaction it has now way of knowing if the pubKey is valid or not. It is completely possible to send coins to address that is a hash of invalid pubKey but there are no way of redeeming those coins. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 07:28:22
Your explanation is a bit off. First the is no such thing as unhasing. After pubKey is hashed there is no way to recover the pubKey. 
A Bitcoin address is a combination of pubKey hash,  version byte and a checksum. The reason why it is unlikely you can misstype a valid address is that a typo invalidates the checksum. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:42:49
I like Bitcoin and all that, but at least where I live, all of those except buying illegal services is easier faster and cheaper with fiat.

One million club == You own one millionth of all bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:10:23
It's not 21 club. Owning 21 bitcoin gets you to 1 million club
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:16:26
Let's do some math. I don't know about US taxation, so I use my taxation for this. If you make a single 1000$ investment in bitcoin, hodl it for 40 years and assume bitcoin will increase its price by 15% yearly. 
By holding it bitcoin directly (0% fees) you have $267863,54. Tax for selling 30% so in the end you have $186804,48
With 2% fees and no tax from selling in the end you will have $132781,55
@_date: 2016-07-25 15:45:11
This would change nothing, miner who finds the nonce for "sync flag" has the same time advantage as the block finder has now. 
Also this can't be implemented as a soft fork because changing block target from 10 to 8 minutes would require a hard fork.

You can skip steps 2 to 3.1.3 by using Shift + right click -&gt; "Open Command Window Here" on the Bitcoin folder. Also Windows command line is not case sensitive like in linux.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:53:38
Or you could use exchange that doesn't have fixed or minimum fees and then buy frequently and withdraw when you have accumulated enough. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 06:53:40
Definitely not the best wallet out there. It's way too oversimplified and missing basic features like changing display unit, connecting to a trusted node or just generating more receive addresses.

SHA256 it's just a hash function used in mining and address generation. To really break Bitcoin you need to break ecdsa on secp256k1 curve.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:14:48


No, public key is calculated by multiplying ec generation point with private key. Bitcoin address (simplified) is a hash of the public key.
