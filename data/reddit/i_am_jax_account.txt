Yupp. Don't write any painkillers for those cancer patients. They'll throw you in Guantanamo for diversion. Luckily, I'm not sick right now and I know how insurance companies work so I don't go to doctors too much. Insurance companies motto should be "better in 3 visits or 2 weeks inpatient or start killing them".

Honestly I've never had a problem with any of these exchanges. Sometimes I think it's just people sending cryptos to the wrong wallet and stuff. Because, although I am not a programmer, I have a hard time figuring out why they work so fine for me and others; yet badly for a few.

lol... all money really. At least cryptocurrency can't be fudged though - as in it happens on the blockchain in front of everyone's eyes.
Sometimes I wonder why banks even go to the trouble of "reserve lending" and "quantitative" ease funding. Just erase the debt column on your little sheet of paper and add some zeros to the assets side. Done. No song and dance needed. Same outcome.

Yeah I mean the bank to Coinbase transfers are all screwed. Even when they work, they take forever. But within coinbase, there's people complaining about coins that don't show up at GDAX from Coinbase or how it won't let them withdraw coins. Probably a lot of that is legacy/segwit discrepancies and wrong wallets.

I'm an Ethereum and Bitcoin guy. And I don't believe those two are directly competitors. Bitcoin is great because it's tried and true. No one has ever broken the actual blockchain and stolen money after all these years. Think about that, it's never been hacked. I often wonder what, if any, cryptanalysts have tried to break into something like Vechain or Tron. People are so busy buying new coins that I sometimes wonder if there's any technical foundation there. I'm not a tech genius but I know enough to know that if these alts can be cracked by someone that will simply walk off with all the tokens, they have no value EVEN IF the concept behind them is great.

Could you please explain this to me. I've been in crypto trading and using for a while but haven't quite become acquainted with the political leanings. Who wanted capacity increase? Ver? and who is the "they" that wants to demonize users and developers from dragging their feet with segwit adoption?
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:10:04

@_date: 2018-01-09 02:45:16
yea newbies have no idea why segwit is good or what btc devs are doing to piss everyone off. I tried posting similar questions and the bot took me down. Getting past reddit bots should be a profession. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:32:59
I've contemplated this repeatedly because the contemplation of this question has implications for future returns. And the conclusion that my (genius) brain has come to is that there's so many governments and banks fucking up right now that Bitcoin can easily hit 100k imo. 
And that's with competition from other cryptos in mind. One thing I've learned is to not consider my own opinions to be overly unique to me. And when I finally got myself up to a full BTC worth of crypto value, I ran right for BTC. Ethereum crossed my mind as well. But no way in hell I'm putting that much in LTC or BCH. And I suspect many others feel similarly.

no.. but we say moon lambo alot. so, there is that. Halfway there I say. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:31:23
Lambo - dick. Screw the farm. 
jk. I see what you're saying. But un-corruptible money is necessary in this day of age where there's 20 million computer hackers and banks just swipe money out of your account because they control it and they can. Lots of steel and structures that house bank vaults could have been used to build houses for people. But people are too dishonest overall and we need to go to great measures to make sure things are secure. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:20:50


I've considered this as well. There are some good implications in this instance even though - imo. For instance, it could mean they will need to pump wealth into cryptos for years on end to make them so attractive that even libertarian drug dealers start slowly buying cryptos. That would leave the current investors just as wealthy as the first round of crypto investors. 
Because, if they want everyone to willingly give up their cash for trackable crypto,  they can't let crypto die or even stagnate in terms of fiat value. It will have to go up so much for so long that holding cash seems stupid (even if it's cash you weren't, for instance taxed on).
Just a theory  - maybe made through naive, self-interested optimism but never say never right. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:25:47
two steps in the right direction. One for Reddit. One for account. One extra if we add moon lambo to our flair. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:01:57
I agree with this. I haven't been forcing cryptos on anyone but I try to help anyone (be it on reddit or real life) if they ask for it. I feel like there's a lot of (very intelligent) crypto users that are (understandably) annoyed and snippy with newbies but still it doesn't help to make people afraid to ask questions.

Gay cakes are liberal. Paypal in this case is up against a conservative. You can only deny services to conservatives. If you're liberal you can pretty much do anything - including killing conservatives. And I say this a liberal myself.

Banks raped the country’s most vulnerable senior citizens and minorities in multiple ways in 2008 and those ppl are still without the pension instruments those banks sold them and the houses they foreclosed on - only to sell again once the people were kicked out. There’s nothing honorable about banks with or without crypto. The government bought their bad debt and they said screw the people and liquidated what people owned only to give their execs bonuses. And banks don’t create credit funds the federal reserve does and then banks are allowed to fractional reserve lend money on top of that they don’t even have and foreclose on real assets when ppl don’t pay them. You don’t need crypto to hate banks. Are u being sarcastic?
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:56:26
Normally, no. "Who is she trying to convince" is what I would think. However, seeing as you're a crypto guy, and an XMR one at that, you're  intelligence is exponentially higher than the average bear and you likely picked a good one.

This is predictable. And completely congruent with life at large. Homophobes are often gay. The woman who says she hates cheaters is a giant whore. The guy who says he's tough is a giant pussy. The bank who says they are against money laundering probably services cartels. Most of what people say, professionally or publicly, can be interpreted as the opposite. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:27:25
That's certainly a very valid possibility. Unless, of course, Bitcoin is actually some kind of ringer asset for powerful people, created by powerful people which is also possible. From what I see, there is a powerful libertarian element of society pulling for Bitcoin and crypto. I mean the CNBC exposure alone is evidence of that. I don't look at it like a "government conspiracy" though. Just a couple of rich, smart, ideological libertarian cowboys pushing up against the central bank, authoritarian left/power elite.

Anonymous forever. The tax implications alone of being found out to be the guy with all those coins is enough to merit being anonymous forever and handing the keys down to your kids secretly. Why would he want to get taxed and then have his estate get taxed and then have his kids get taxed on their estate etc? As soon as anyone knows who satoshi is, they are going to look for reasons to take his coins.

lol... do you watch the news? Or visit watchdog websites ever? Our "finest" in the military and police forces LOVE killing innocent people. Homeless people, people holding anything even remotely resembling a gun (garden hoses), people running away, dogs (cops have a dog shooting addiction). "comply"? I think a lot of military guys and most police would jump at the opportunity to shoot innocent people.

I'm not really emotionally involved in BTC vs. BCH like some people but I objectively don't think Roger Ver will ever be able to lift BCH to anywhere near the heights he wants to. At this point, it would be like trying to make Ajit Pai as loved as Keanu Reeves. It's more than a pipe dream. Once the millennials hate you, they hate you, you're done. And if they love, you become a top reddit post every two weeks (see Elon Musk and Keanu Reeves).

I'd go as far as to say a large majority of charitable people are "criminals". These types of people do anything: they might donate in Bitcoin or illegally video tape police killing someone or god forbid feed homeless people in ritzy areas of Florida where they don't want human destitution visibility. It really is a reverse world nowadays where I even trust a shitcoin ico over a stockbroker.

I hear certain people say that Bitcoin has the best dev team, but who are they? What I see more is workshops and output from Ethereum devs. I'm not being condescending. I really want to know who/where they are. Do they have social media accounts like Vitalik or Charlie? If not, how do you know they are active or even exist?

Honestly it probably could. Should even in the relatively near future if tech progresses as expected. There's at least enough resources for everyone currently living to not be homeless. Of course trillions would have to be allocated away from weapons and into living needs. Even the Iraq war alone could have afforded every American something like 40k.
