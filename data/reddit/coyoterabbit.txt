I hope every single coin gets put to a use that enables the greater good of humanitarianism and industry. If someone across the globe can benefit from bitcoin (and blockchain cryptography) then there is real world value to it all. Looking outside of the box of "dips" "hodls" and other nonsense, there is game-changing technology afoot, and with attention of big players around the world. I feel like these subreddits are a bunch of kids who got the $100 weekly buy on Coinbase and are now seasoned day-traders.

Absolutely. I'm still trying to re-read the post and make sense of it. I can't imagine the confusion for a newcomer trying to make heads or tails of what's going on in the crypto world... aren't the mods supposed to be keeping this coherent and not some garbage bin for shitposts?

I don't know what people are thinking either, but most people haven't got a clue and just like to voice their "knowledge" regardless of experience. There's a lot of capital (brokerages, mining centers, exchanges) that would need to whittle away before the "death" of bitcoin. It's just not going to happen. When you have players with millions invested in something it's not at a whim or a drop-of-the-hat bet, there's board meetings, think-tanks and a hell of a lot of grey-beards to consult with before dropping that kind of dough.

I agree, it's just a collection of buzzwords, nonsense, and unstructured sentences. Thank the sweet lord they're not my financial adviser...

I think this whole post got deleted. Thanks to you as well, I love reddit because there is still some incredibly knowledgeable users on the subs, but get shouted over by these "yo guys" posts

There is a good article on candian blockchain companies here: 
I hope they all have success, it's a great technology that can be spread to many sectors (medical records, telecom, storage, etc.)

Are we all day-trading bitcoin? If so then this post is some kind of feel-good narrative for all the kids out there with $100 into bitcoin? Isn't there a better way we can discuss than starting with "yo guys...", and if anyone's even taking the advice of this person... would you follow an earnings report that started off with "Yo guys"?

Finally some knowledge in this subreddit! Well put
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:57
What the hell kind of garbage post is this?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:40:34
What if you are dealing in satoshi's?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:09:24
So the poster indicates in the comments that he/she doesn't own any bitcoin... is this subreddit for actual knowledge or just sensationalized headlines? "It's a bubble guys" what? Maybe I should take financial advice from my dog-walker next.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:33
I am! I still don't fully grasp the post text, or know if it's actually fact or science-fiction
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:01:26
delicious and dangerous

This is like me giving you a bag of air and wanting your item/asset/software in return. Are you going to accept that trade? How many empty bags would you like?
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:42:35
So you have the golden goggles, able to forecast the un-forecastable... why spend time on reddit then? You should be out there collecting your millions.

You mean the people that are reading this?
