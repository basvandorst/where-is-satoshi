Lol at everyone freaking out in here. Lost all hope that quick? Sweet jesus... This is accumulation range people. It's not going down to 8k/7k etc, sorry folks. More likely 16k next month.

Personally I've noticed the vast majority of people claiming exactly that, that alts will moon after btc crosses 20k. So if everyone is expecting that, it will likely happen before that.
I have no doubt alts will moon again, just not all of them...hopefully. Some need to burn and die.

You have to use crayon, it works better that way.

Perhaps the whales that cashed out in December can give us the cardboard boxes from all the new stuff they bought.

I think we're going back up to 9k resistance, then drop back down for an 8k support, then a re-test of 10k about a month from now. 20k in September. imo ofc :)

Yeah, he also said Docademic would be $2.50 by July. Reality: 13c.

I believe it's east of Dumpville. Just follow Shitcoin road and chuck a left.

Are you? It's called sarcasm.

This is the last time we'll be under 10k guys, mark my words lol

BTC Markets. OSKO deposit, immediate funds.

For me personally, reality has set in and I'm expecting this to go down to 4k area, maybe high 3's. And it will bounce between that and 5k for a while, I'm talking months for this to play out. The December bullrun many are expecting probably won't happen...more likely next year now.
Not fudding. Just zooming out on the chart and coming to grips with what it a potential scenario. Still too much optimism in the market imo.

I'm running out of crayon to mark everyone's words
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:21:38
Ok guys, THIS is the last time you'll see sub 10k, mark my words.
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:22:43
That's like saying people are foolish for selling btc back in 2016 at $600 after it has pumped from $200. Maybe take a look at one of those charts you referenced lol

Full disclosure, this is a re-post of another thread - 
I thought it was hilarious and figured we could all use a laugh today lol. I've literally been breaking into tears of laughter randomly in public the last few days thinking about it. Good times haha. Cheers /u/Diqiurenminbi
