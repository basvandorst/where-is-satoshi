 State Sen. John Moorlach, R-Costa Mesa, released an independent analysis of CalTrans’ budget showing that only 20 percent of the gas tax funds were spent anywhere near roads.

okay, well i'm referring to the "not-passing" of proposition 6 which, if passed, would have repealed the recent gas taxes. the taxes are supposed to go road repair/infrastructure, but only 20% of what has been collected has gone anywhere near those projects. most taxes are  bad, but poorly written ones are just plain garbage

yep we voted to keep the highest gas prices in the country, so obviously we don't know what we are doing
