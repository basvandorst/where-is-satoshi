Actually you may be paying more in electricity than you’re making with bitcoin

Yeah, if you’re seriously contemplating doing this then you’re pretty pathetic.

Then get into some cryptos that are currently low on the BTC ratio. Ethereum is very low and LTC is in the middle of the ratio trend. Skip the fomo. May miss out on a run but you'll be in cryptos that historically catch up to BTC.

That was in the middle of the Chinese exchange FUD. I can't see how those comments could have put more then a small ding on the crypto market cap.

Agreed, check out my edit on my first post. Looks like it was deemed unconstitutional to some degree.

Doesn't mean that there are billions flowing in. The market cap is the most recent price that a BTC or BCH sold for times the amount of BTC or BCH in existence. If everyone sold their coins at the exact same time the price would go to near zero. Same as all other markets. 
BCH has a smaller trading pool, meaning there are less BCH changing hands. This makes it easier to affect the price -&gt; a smaller amount of money can drastically change the price. Not chump change but not billions.

From what I remember in some cases it was considered probable cause, which I think is unconstitutional, but that's our police state. X-rays are different in that the police/dea/FBI would have to emit the x-ray, and then collect the information. It's different if the citizen is the one creating and projecting the information than if law enforcement is projecting the rays. It's nuanced. All unethical in my opinion but it happens. 
I looked into this stuff a while back for, um... reasons.

Oh cool! Didn't know LED had the light type that plants need. Last time I looked into it was 2007, so I'm out of the loop.

100%. They do it in helicopters. There's a lot of interesting court cases about the legality of getting warrants on heat signatures, since it's sort of a violation of privacy. Prior courts have ruled that since you're emitting information (heat), then its public domain (just as radio waves are public domain) and therefore law enforcement can use that information to search your home or whatever with a warrant. 
Edit/Correction: looks like a Supreme Court ruled that thermal imaging is not probable cause or exclusive grounds for a warrant. But this article corroborates that they have and continue to use it along with other methods:

Tons of indoors. You have to keep them temperature controlled and shit ton of lights to grow. This all takes a massive amount of electricity and creates a ton of heat. Hence why law enforcement subpoenas electric companies.

Anyone else cringe at “crypto dads”? What are you, 17?
How about professional government employees actually do their job and research for once.

So... they’ll run from a market that looses 2% and get into a market that just lost 65% in a month?
