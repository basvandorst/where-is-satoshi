You can actually get started now with Stripe.  
If you use Stripe Checkout, it's a fairly easy integration, though probably not as nice as Coinbase.

This is pretty much the way to go if you don't want use a 3rd party service.  None of the blockchain APIs (chain.com, block.io, etc...) allow you to create addresses, only to monitor them.
There were a bunch of file upload btc services, but they've all closed up shop it seems.  
  
Also, what makes you think this is an "easy implementation"?  How would you go about doing this without bitcoin, without 3rd party services as you've asked?

No, it's not.  See Tunecore or CDBaby or Distrokid.  At most publishers get 9%.  
Edit:  If you're talking about iTunes, well that's a store - not a distributor.  Bandcamp would be a good comparison - and they charge like 3%.
Anyway, you should be striving to give the artists as much money as you can.  They're the ones that make your service viable.

Indeed - they are understandably not pushing it yet - just not integrated well.  For instance, there's no clear way to list your Bitcoin orders in their otherwise fabulous dashboard (there is a way, but the link is hidden in that beta guide.)
They're using Coinbase and I remember it being odd when I paid from a Coinbase account because my payment was seemingly sent to a personal account (not the merchant or even a general Stripe business account).  Just not smooth, yet.

The less confirmation time, the less secure, as I understand it.  Less time = less nodes confirming/accepting transactions = a smaller consensus = not as trustworthy.

Ahh, I had direct downloads set up on our site for bitcoin, but the company that was making it very easy (BTCfile) was flaky and closed down. 
I could definitely set it up myself, but I haven't had the time.
We use Bandcamp for digital because it has great exposure and people seem to like buying from them.  
I've been toying with the idea of creating a Bandcamp type site that accepts BTC but then I came up on some work I had to take.

Tough but highly enjoyable reading - A Thousand Plateaus.  Deleuze and Guattari's range of references and use of different disciplines are so wide ranging.  I think Manuel DeLanda does a great job of analyzing and building on their work.  
My problem is I'm not well versed in Freud + Marx and enough of the subjects they draw upon.  
Anyway, to the Rhizome!  Much of what has been discussed in this thread is also discussed by D+G.  The idea that rhizomes won't save us. 
The smooth (roughly the rhizome) and the striated (arborescent/rooted-tree structures) aren't exactly opposed, but intertwined and react with each other:  you'll find rhizomatic juts and vectors within areas of rigid organization just as structure and organization tend to sprout up within rhizomes.

I'm with you to an extent.  And that was my first reaction.  But this is money.  And gobs of money for some people.  
You can call Wells Fargo and speak to someone.  You can call Citibank and speak to someone.  You can go into your local bank branch and speak to someone in person.  
You can't pursue any of those solutions when dealing with Coinbase.  I am NOT an 'eff-coinbase-it-isn't-bitcoin' person.  I don't question their solvency.  I DO think they need to hire someone who can speak to people on the phone and maybe up their email response.  Even if it's just for peace of mind.

Nope.  This doesn't support your claim that the majority of people who die from drugs "die from doctor prescribed medication being used in compliance with doctors orders."
It just doesn't.  It looks at hospitalized patients and even then " making these reactions between the fourth and sixth leading cause of death."
This is not an analysis of the rate at which patients die from doctors prescribing medicine.  It's just not. 
I had to go as far as the sidebar on your link to find studies that refute it, too:

Ruby web developer here.  I'd stick with Python for the backend.  Check out Django for a framework: 
I think these sites' commonality has as much to do with design trends in general as it does with any framework.  Yes, Bootstrap ( has influenced tons of design but I think it's part of a greater trend toward flat graphics/elements + clean layouts.  
Frontend wise, depends what kind of site you are building.  Single page apps/javascript frameworks are all the rage now-a-days (Ember / Angular / React / etc), but I really think it can be overkill for small projects or sites that don't fit into their mold.  Plus, it's a lot to learn if you haven't worked with a backend web framework before.  With these sites (js front end frameworks) your backend sends data, usually in the form of JSON, to the front end which populates that data into a client side html template.  This is opposed to having the backend doing the template rendering and sending to the client side.
Front end: you should know CSS as that's what's going to style the site.  Otherwise, I'd check out jQuery to help you out on the JS end.  HTML5 of course. 
If this sounds like a lot, you *could* check out Wordpress.  It's a blogging framework built on PHP.  Because of its theming support you can probably get a site up and running more quickly than if you develop the entire site from scratch.  Wordpress can become a mess when you want to go in and modify things, depending on your needs and your tolerance for PHP hacking.  (There are wordpress 'stacks' like Bedrock -  - but you would probably need to know more about Wordpress, first)
Sorry, I know this response is a bit messy, but it's a large subject to tackle (and I'm working, too.. :)).
Feel free to PM if you'd like to discuss more.  I don't have any experience with Python, but I've been working with CSS/HTML/JS for about a decade and Ruby for 5 years.

@_date: 2016-09-03 18:36:39
It's true, but that's not the reason why merchants integrate it over, say, Stripe.  Stripe is much much easier to integrate for developers (mostly because their docs aren't covering 1000 different overlapping APIs from the past 15 years), but PayPal's market saturation keeps them around.

I don't understand the fascination with tying speech to money.  
I do understand, for instance, Jerod Lanier's point of view that we should be paid for our data.  It's just that this idea isn't that.

Which is what Lanier (and others) speak about. 
One man's useless comment is another man's opinion.  I just don't agree with making people pay to say something.  I also really doubt the reasoning that it will eliminate spam.   
The idea seems like a sanitized corridor version of the internet.  Some people barely have enough money to get by, if that.  Why would you charge them to speak?  
I'm allowed to express my opinion on this idea.  I'm not sure why you're so pissed off.  Go ahead and build it or use one of the many already attempted solutions people have been linking to in this thread.

The reason why it isn't a problem is why Bitcoin is so genius in the first place.  
Each coin doesn't 'checkout on a main website', but rather is checked out by thousands (?) of miners all operating independently to verify each transaction.   
These miners' main task is to mathematically verify transactions.
