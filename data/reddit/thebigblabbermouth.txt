Keep up the great work
@_date: 2016-08-12 09:55:46
could you give me some more advice
I still can not get the Check Callback Response Log 
i encoded it before i send it like you said with..
    call_back_address = urllib.quote(call_back_address)
the website call back log input field is here
    
to give me a confirmation no matter what i put into it
i pasted the whole code im using so that you can see the output and the code... maybe the website is broken or something
do i have to return an ***ok*** back to the website after i get the respose or something
*The code*
	def GetNewAddress():
		# -----------------------Request new address from blockchain.info------------- #
		def id_generator(size=10, chars=string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits):
			
			return ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(size))
		def get_time_stamp():
			time_stamp = time.time()
			return time.asctime(time.localtime(time_stamp))
		secret = id_generator()
		time_stamp_readable =  get_time_stamp()
		my_address = '138o4nN2yE1Bx9j1qgF9iTYKgW1SC2nTgm'
		invoice_number = 1
		call_back_address = " % (invoice_number, secret)
		print "----"
		print call_back_address
		print "----"
		# encode the callback address to json
		call_back_address = urllib.quote(call_back_address)
		url = " % (my_address,call_back_address)
		# send the request to the blockapi
		response = urllib2.urlopen(url)
		print response
		print type(response)
		response = json.load(response)
		print type(response)
		for i in response:
			print i
			print response[i]
	GetNewAddress()
*The output*

thanks! but dont vote this down i need replies so i can fence with people around me using their info...
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:49:28
could you help me... i request an address from  and get this response which appears to be a success...
    {"callback_url":"http:\/\/
[Finished in 1.2s]
but when I paste the following into blockapi's website "Check Callback Response Log" query box i get an error
    http:\/\/
i even remove the  back slashes and i get the same result
    
the error a the website is this
    The URL must be exactly equal to when it was passed to the create address method (including parameters). There is no fuzzy matching.
@_date: 2016-08-21 00:13:05
That is just a random secret, I generated unique secret numbers when I used blockchains old api
@_date: 2016-08-29 03:04:09
How much is your fee? I will definitely use you if I get stuck, I would like you to edit and correct my code for like $10, $20 a pop or depending on how complicated it is we can agree on a price, what do you think
@_date: 2016-08-23 02:20:43
Will much change after that? Will the miners just continue? Will it be much less money? 
@_date: 2016-08-09 03:33:17
What is a valid argument that it is a commodity?
@_date: 2016-08-28 10:59:25
What if some how for some reason an address was sent two payments? How do i single out the right transaction? Do i tell them to send a specific amount? or is there an even better way to target a transaction?
Isn't there a way to just use urllib2.urlopen(url) and query a url at blockr.io for a specific addresses balance?
They give and example like this on their website to query data about an address...
    
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:23:09
Thanks, I will assume that from now. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:12:42
Buy a phone with cash use a cafe's wifi to trade.
OP ar YOU trying to mislead people? !
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:05:50
So is btctrip okay? Legit?
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:20:58
Lol, fuck the man! Just do it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:24:50
I don't get it
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:20:35
I just bought a ticket but they didn't ask for a passport number from me.. is that normal I forget
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:30:31
Lets face it bitcoin is a far superior tool to facility the trade of two commodities. 
But can it smuggle gold out of greece?
I would only sell my bitcoins to a Greek at $1000+ each.
The smuggler deserves it.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:05:59
Yeah exactly! , scoot over I want to give you a kiss
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:04:59
I asked is it physically possible to stop people trading in bitcoins, sounds like a no to me.
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:18:28
He mentioned he had a degree in cryptography or something and is french.. lol
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:16:30
What was the gist of it I can't watch atm
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:31:33
No I agree. But the second question is what are the cyclical fundamentals
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:26:58
Some guy was telling me today you cant because of certificates or something
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:53:05
I agree, short memories
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:46:17
Ugga bugga?
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:07:34
Are you looking at the whole chart? A cups base is curved. This will be a clear M shape if it drops.
@_date: 2017-02-17 09:39:15
I don't understand... mining*? Because you have to compete for a coin? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:04:42
Its a big world mate with a lot of different countries and a lot of different competing governments...
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:53:29
fucked up?
Newby here
what do you mean?
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:32:51
Wow 600btc ouch
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:21:22
This is a very important thread showing the true dirty nature of BU.
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:56:39
Especially since they seem to have their foot on gold now
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:45:51
Ugga bugga
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:51:37
exactly.. we dont know what the fuck they are putting into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:53:03
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:02:11
I just sold all my Bitcoin. BU is right.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:43:01
BU centralizes power to miners who have more hashing power.
I can't hear your argument at all.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:54:12
So my btc are safe then?
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:33:05
I'm trading on the right platform! Thankyou bitfinex!
tldr 


@_date: 2017-03-11 18:03:49
I was too tired to worry about the government blabber so I rolled over hodling my coins and went to sleep.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:14:44
I don't understand do I need to sell my bitcoin? And buy a new coin?
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:04:46
both wont confirm...
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:47:57
calm down
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:12:54
... but I just wanna take their stuff :3... ill just sell a little brah
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:26:09
Things really are starting to stink about BU.
They seem desperate
Paid ads
Sob pieces
The time between comments is shaped
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:46:22
I thought he was actually an Australian who didn't trust his own invention and got cashing out for gold.... but he got caught by 'police' who took his gold.
Ill try and find a link. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:00:45
could you just ease my pain... will it ever get confirmed?
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:39:17
So your answer is that the lowest offer decides the price then?
So I can just post a trade of $1 on localbitcoin and the price will drop.....
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:51:52
Thank you very helpful
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:18:49
... but the SEC effect on bitcoin was more like a breeze from the single flap of a mosquito wing against a blazing sun.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:30:14
Look at the whole chart, its one big double top
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:21:42
Wait. .. can't I go onto localbitcoin and click on the highest selling trade and send him the cash and he sends me the bitcoins... who is going to stop us...
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:38:37
You can still pay their wives for a blow job with it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:32:10
Keep the government out of btc so no hardfork! 
Same as the SEC!
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:02:31
Fiat is a Ponzi scheme because someone has to borrow it for it to exist and to pay that principle back plus interest, somebody else has to borrow a larger amount. Because the Interest physically doesn't exist yet.
You saw this happen with the 2008 housing bubble, nobody expected to pay their loan off.
Mortgages were mostly 25+ year loans. People were flipping their houses for Capital gains.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:06:40
great its working, thank you very much
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:12:56
I would absolutely love to read decentralized news.
I wonder what hidden truths would be reported. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:30:18
Dude, there is a Legion of people out there, most of them still can't see or understand the cage yet. But they feel it.
And think about it, we have invisible communism dressed in capitalism fuel by never ending 0% interest rates.
That legion will just keep growing and growing.
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:57:59
Yeah I agree but steve jobs does not Have a gun to our heads.
And the family unit is pure slavery and communism btw
@_date: 2015-08-31 00:40:36
Yeah,  and most of them are not business people,  just government workers and consumers of our products.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:31:33
Smart move, greece is delinquent. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:40:20
Lets make this clear.
I was literally forced by government to take refuge in bitcoin.
And yes, gold can be detected by airport metal detectors.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:39:40
Thank you, this need to be voted up.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:43:33
What does this mean?
Does it relate to greece and the death throws of slave credit money? 
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:29:06
Huh? 
You cant even see/identify the work the free market has to do to fill that gap?
Let me guess you are a lazy investor. 
Move along peasant 
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:26:54
Yeah and thats why a lot of people are pissed off.
Do you know how easy life was before?
I could work 2 days a week washing dishes and could still pay my rent, food and the spend the rest of the day at the beach surfing.
Gold is just a important today as it was in the 17th century.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:54:25
you are the first person to make a really intelligent reply to this post!
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:18:30
Your so dead right.
No storage fees like gold.
No foot work to count it all  in a vault.
The collateral can change hands instantly.
Bitcoin is it!
Then the winner can buy his gold or what ever when he needs it.
Think of all the oil this will save flying gold and other collateral around. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 23:46:29
I don't get what all the hoo haa is for..
Download multibit make a wallet and give your address to a payer.
It seriously took me 15min
But then again I had help from a how to video that 7 year old made om YouTube
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:02:55
Looks like your going to have to sell something cool to get some bitcoin.
Get to work son.
Do you realize the reason that you won't get to work is actually. ..
The real bubble!
@_date: 2016-09-20 01:32:25
but you can query a pruned bitcoind block chain right? which is only a few gb...
@_date: 2016-09-19 08:22:31
okay, thank you
how about money wagon? is that a good option?
@_date: 2016-09-19 08:43:24
okay thank you I will buy some more server space or turn on prunning, does moneywagon still use a 3rd party?
@_date: 2016-09-15 05:32:30
and you will never find the solution like i just did 5 seconds ago from gigahostdk
@_date: 2016-09-19 08:25:37
but if you download bitcoind will it download the entire blockchain? I dont have the server space for that... is pycoin or money wagon a better
@_date: 2016-09-12 07:04:30
...but whats the accepted one thats popular?
@_date: 2016-09-12 07:08:18
very interesting, but why do 2) and 3) negate the algorithm's power to speed up the transaction...
@_date: 2016-09-15 05:31:44
Absolutely fucking genius!
Accept it and put a flag on it until when ever it is confirmed.
@_date: 2015-09-23 03:03:55
I don't really understand what this is for..
Can somebody explain it slowly to me?
@_date: 2015-09-21 03:19:42
That's really awesome! 
I hope I can use a bitcoin atm one day!
@_date: 2015-09-14 10:41:46
Lets be very very clear here 10 bitcoins is 10 bitcoins!
The only thing changing is the infinite number of dollars in the hundres of currencies that want those 10 bitcoins or don't! 
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:15:24
You cant know the real price of anything these days because of the money bazookas.
But gold is still the hands down the best store of value. 
Bit coin should probably be a mechanism for the trade of goods between people. 
Because other payment systems just milk and report you
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:59:39
Thank you very much, great read.
@_date: 2015-09-14 11:12:25
What is your point?
@_date: 2015-09-08 14:35:08
So says the most fascist country on the planet.
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:28:36
What is a better alternative to btcbalance.net?
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:47:38
okay thank you
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:18:43
how long does it take for the transaction to go through normally for you? When it is 0 confirmations? And you know how much of a fee you pay?
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:45:39
@_date: 2015-10-30 12:18:52
Using bitcoin?
Sell me a ship..
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:04:52
Okay cool, thanks
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:40:08
this needs to done badly
@_date: 2016-07-31 20:20:42
thanks so much
