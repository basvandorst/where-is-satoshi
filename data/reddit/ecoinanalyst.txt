Liptonaround already translated it for you.  The way it is written, and your past posts leads me to believe you're spreading fake news.  Furthermore, I doubt Wolf would post something like this, rather than translate it himself.

There isn't a way. You probably just have to brute force it.  Either way, you cannot do anything but view/deposit into the public key.  You need private key to withdraw

people have thought about this, thats why there have been code audits, and entire of blockchain re-evaluated constantly.  The reason why bitcoin is so big, is because the past cannot be altered.

The deal about mining with bitcoin nowadays is that you're mining for the future.  Without a decent rig, you can run yourself into the negative by mining. Most of the BTC, that you will mine, will go towards your expenses.  The profits are kept, so that when they appreciate they will be worth more.  This is why its mining for the future.  BTC mining is quite the tricky business.  I would say, if you're starting out, go for gpu mining with asic resistant coins.

Hey, I'm really curious now, let us know if you ever get the TX ID from him. And whether or not it was a fake photo

hmm... partially correct.  I did not anticipate the extremely quick drop to 2800, followed by a rebound to 3500.  But then again, it still is hovering around 3890.  I think my prediction was as closer than anyone could have predicted

I know how to deposit, trade, withdraw, and cashout to fiat anonymously if that's what you're looking for.  But its quite a lot of work, and steps. message me if you are interested

The problem is... People are all about "its going to MOON" or "its going to DROP".   You don't think it could stabilize between a few hundred dollars for a bit?

Could you list the source?

why did you choose ounce, instead of pounds. Or kilograms?

Theres actually an entire article on this out there somewhere.  Just google "can ledger s nano be tampered with" and it should show up somewhere.  It talked about possibly having chips installed inside of it.  Other than that, the way it verifies that it is using 100% firmware from ledger is quite interesting, and very secure.

Sorry, didn't realize you had the private key.

I was actually researching this and planning out a forecast of the future.  I believe if the US stock market crashes, bitcoins/altcoins will take a small hit.  However, a quick rebound present itself, as those investors will seek other sources (which will most likely be crypto) as a source of investments.  In total, after everything has settled down; the cryptoworld will see higher pre-crash market capital, while the US market will have consistent all-time-lows.
