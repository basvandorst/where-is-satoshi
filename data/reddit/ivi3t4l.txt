I hope this question is asked.  Bitcoin education is very important.

Anybody else notice there are no transaction fees on any of the transactions?

No shit.  I never read this post as im not a newcomer but decided to check it out to see what newcomers see.   Wish they had info here.  Like securing coins with armory and electrum.  Where to buy the coins...etc.   this makes me sad.  This would be a great place to put bitcoin education material.  Instead it is reddiquete

It wasnt a confirmation issue.  The funds were sent and confirmed in the blockchain.  Gox was incompitent and their software watched for transaction hashes for verification (allegedly) that the transaction went through.

Wow....... that would be amazing. Someone please do this.  I want this so bad.

I agree with this.  Armory is the best solution at the moment.  Electrum is also good.  Get a bunch of usb keys and if your ultra paranoid add truecrypt to the mix

Im not sure how they plan on working in the future, but from what i heard this on was only loaded with 3 btc and was not connected to any exchange.  It was just a demo for the conference.

Sorry i meant to have to say that they would have to have matching outputs also.  Isnt there a way to check that the hash has been malformed.   If that is crosschecked i dont think the number would be that high.  I could be wrong though.

If only there was some sort of account you could store your money in that would be impossible for anyone to freeze...... That being said, I hope it all works out for ya!

No risks?  Are you new here?

I cant find the source but I have seen that 99.9% of all coins will be mined by 2030.

Gox deposits are still slow... a week... come on.  I wish we had a way to transfer money quickly to one another in a couple of minutes.  Wouldnt that be great!  I wish something like that existed...
