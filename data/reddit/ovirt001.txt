I don't see it going that low. It *might* hit $6,000. I'm just hoping to buy a dip at $9,000.

Actually, they're likely losing more than they gain. The rich in China are using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to get their money out before China's economy shits itself.  
  
Before you ask why, among a plethora of other problems China has a $9 trillion shadow debt market. Once this pops (like it did when banks in the US tried that shit) the economy will come crashing down.

Now is a pretty good time to get an antminer S9. I looked earlier today, you'd get ~$900/mo right now. It'll probably pay itself off in 3-4 months.

That, and it's not actually a site about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:36:36
China didn't mean to give the world a gift, but they did. Now they won't have the capacity to distort the market through miners.

BCH won't scale like Bitcoin will. The BCH fork was WITHOUT Segwit which means it cannot use off-chain scaling solutions like the Lightning Network. It's a scam coin.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:21:19
Ethereum will carry on regardless of what happens with Bitcoin. The price might dip but it'll keep on being a distributed computer system. Same goes for Sia.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:38:43


LTC is a more sensible alternative to BCH. Ethereum's primary function isn't to be a currency. Monero has a niche market. Not sure about Railblock.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:23:31
It will. It's actually a pretty amazing idea and (when combined with a couple other coins) has the potential to replace AWS and other cloud providers.

I don't think it's FUD at all. Remember, China's government is run by the Chinese Communist Party. They're known for stupid, heavy-handed regulation that damages the country.

Good. This will force decentralization and hurt an authoritarian regime.

We might start seeing countries' currencies crash after LN is implemented. Once people realize that Bitcoin can be used for payments I expect adoption will increase quickly.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:24:54


Which will be great for those still mining. I'm seriously considering buying in the next batch of Antminers.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. Seriously though, it'll be banned and unbanned repeatedly when it suits the communist party.

Won't know for awhile if it turns into anything but Japan's GMO (isp) is supposedly working on building 7nm miners. They'll handily beat the S9 if/when they come out.

Nope. Came across it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:01:39
He's not wrong. BCH is doomed to be centralized due to mining and node hosting expenses.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:14
Well, they have so far been making progress on LN so I would expect implementation within a year. At that point it will absolutely be a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:15:23
The Lightning Network will reduce the number of transactions posted to the main chain. It will still grow but not nearly as quickly.

Coinbase offers a service to businesses that want to accept bitcoin. In simple terms, the bitcoin is immediately sold and the USD amount is deposited into the merchant's account.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:40:14
Yup, that was the fork. A bunch of people got butthurt over Segwit and created a crappy alternative to BTC that won't scale.

It's only "stuck" until you move it to a personal wallet.

Not a correction, just pointing that out. On a side note, the US isn't allied with China and is actually slightly at risk of going to war with them over North Korea (China keeps posturing suggesting they'd back NK in a war).

For $10 on an exchange with a maker-taker fee schedule.

GDAX seriously needs to work on systems scaling. This is becoming a norm and screwing with the price.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:50:43
Increasing block size gives diminishing returns. It increases node size exponentially and pushes more work onto miners (which is completely unsustainable).
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:15:23


Gold's use in products is not the reason for its price. Most of the value in gold is its status as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:46:46
Valid point. It would be more like $13.50 by the time it hits your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:14:40


The trade volume isn't high enough to have the same issues as Bitcoin is having. LTC is faster as well, it doesn't mean it will take over.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:45
Right now it's eating away at gold's share. Seeing as the gold market is worth $8 trillion, this is nothing. If it took over gold, the price would be &gt;$400,000 per coin. That said, the next step will be taking over traditional currencies. If the lightning network works as expected, transaction fees will plummet and TPS will skyrocket, allowing efficient transactions between businesses and consumers.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:29:00
I'm waiting a bit longer. There's a huge buy wall at ~$12,200 on GDAX.

China is against bitcoin because the communist party sees it as a challenge to their power.

If you don't already have one, get an accountant. Then ask about investing in small loans. They should be able to point you in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:24:19
Although bcash may have made some significant gains, as a technology it's trash. It's the fork of Bitcoin from when Segwit was introduced. In other words, it can't be scaled by any method other than block size changes (which isn't a feasible scaling solution).
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:28:28
"NASDAQ 1998-2000"  
Seems legit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:07:03
Segwit enabled sidechains. That was the whole point of the hard fork.  
There seems to have been a misinformation campaign on behalf of BCH. BCH broke away when Segwit was enabled and would have to copy BTC by enabling it to be able to scale (which makes it completely redundant).
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:46
That will change with the Lightning Network. All of the cryptocurrencies have a TPS problem (some less than others). The only real competitor to LN is Raiden which is Eth only to my knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:07:01


If you actually have $100K to loan out, you could look into private lending or co-ownership.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:02:17
For now the only ones dumping BTC for BCH are those that have no idea how either works. BTC will prevail and become a legitimate currency, BCH will fall because it is neither a store of value nor can it scale to become a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:07:53
Ah, misread it the first time through.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:27:06
LN allows alternate channels which would make it more like having side-roads in addition to the highway.

It's time for China to lose its mining equipment monopoly.
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:37:14
More developers and more active development. There's a reason BTC is worth 10x more.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:11:46


Considering BCH is almost exclusively mined in China, Bitcoin has greater decentralization.

Bitcoin ownership works the same as cash ownership. If it's in your possession and you have the ability to spend it, you're effectively the owner.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:30:15
There's no guarantee where the price will go since it's based on adoption but I can say that as soon as the Lightning Network is fully implemented that Bitcoin will be practical for any payment.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:25:16
Bitcoin is worth as much as people have bought into it. Currently, Bitcoin is still only owned by a minority of people and is valued at a small fraction of gold. Ultimately, if it does replace all currency the value will be &gt;$1 million/coin.

It's reasonably profitable. You'll get around $6/day in profit with the S9. It'll take you a year to pay off the investment though.
