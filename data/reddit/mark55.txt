I believe that every experience is a learning experience if you look at it in the right light.  
I want to show that light to as many people as possible, so I do stand up showing the humorous side of all the 'terrible' things that have happened in my life.  I believe that one of the best things a person can do for another human being is to make them laugh.  Happiness is a chain reaction that starts with a joke.
  My mothers death when I was 17,  my numerous surgeries and the next two spinal fusions I am facing, the amount of time I've spent at a hospital to my cheating ex girlfriends, to the the doctors at Cleveland Clinic that say I've got 20 years left before i'm paralyzed from the neck down.  Yes, I am scared shitless, but I don't show it.  I don't hide this or talk about it often, but it has made me live every day to it's fullest!
I would use this to help the people of my city, Buffalo by starting a yearly festival that highlights the arts, that allows all of the amateur musicians, visual artists, comedians and performance artists to have a time slot at a well known venue.  
I will extract smiles from the people of my city, if you want to help, I would be very much appreciated.  This goes for any amount, big or small.  I'm going to do this festival in the fall either way, and plan of it to be a yearly thing.  If you donate, you can name it!

Come on!  Well, it's going to take hold eventually.  Time to keep pumping money into it, I guess.

Thank you so much for this.  Recovered my .1btc!

When I attempted this, it said that the private key was invalid.  I tried adding the word bitcoin ahead of the string and it claimed the secret key was invalid. I ended up exporting the wallet on Mycellium - as soon as I did that, I came back to the screen and it said that (instead of just having one secret key and 0 BTC) that I had 2 secret keys in my account and my 0.1 BTC.
I was also re-scanning the barcode using Blockchains terrible QR code reader and trying to import that code. One of these things worked.
Dude, if you are still having trouble, PM me. I'll go through what I did step by step with ya!
