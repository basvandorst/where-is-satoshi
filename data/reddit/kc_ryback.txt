My goodness. Very few people and a handful of exchanges own almost all of the Bitcoin in circulation. BitMex made over 1 Billion dollars in liquidations over the past 3 months and are now being investigated by multiple agencies for fraud. Open your eyes and look at any fucking chart my brother; a giant red candle immediacy followed by a giant green candle happens over and over week after week.
Why do you think that is? Someone selling and a bunch of Bitcoin and people instantly buying that dip? Lol, no. Fuck no. Thats 1 person crashing the market by intention and buying back his own coins at 10 or 12% cheaper; the buy orders are already in place before they crash it. Or, it's the exchanges cashing in on a skew of long or short bets. The evidence is right in front of you, you just need to put your emotions and dreams caused by those emotions aside and realize what the fuck is really going on. Very few entities control the entire thing and when you look up the wallet sizes online you will see how few have more than 1BTC. The rich are here to get rich and they keep you from getting rich in the process. Half these hype posts you see here are fake, all of the .com crypto news websites and their articles are sponsored and paid for by people who are going to manipulate the shit out of people like you and I.
I wish you the best of luck, and I sincerely hope I am wrong. But please don't fuck yourself because you got tricked into the idea that this is real. It's not, and all of these hype posts are made by people who are paid to make them or who have direct interest in the game. It's all manipulated all the time. Don't ruin your future or your families inheritance over an unregulated scam called Bitcoin that peaked your interest and fantasies. There is a very good, absolutely clear, and amazingly simple reason why Satoshi Nakamoto never did and never will come out of hiding. Just think about it.

It will never make it to the point where "the man" would feel the necessity to act on it, much less shut it down. A few whales and the exchanges are raking in millions and millions, and they will keep the price low enough in order to avoid attention from regulation or "the man" so the cycle can repeat over and over.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:47:33
Beautiful execution. They took everyones $ from the 2017 pump and waited long enough for them to forget the pain before they pumped again. The hype not only dragged in some outsiders who were on the sidelines last time, but also resurrected the old dreamers into thinking they knew it all along. They just don't know how fucked they are yet. I broke even and got out a few weeks ago, up a few % overall. I hope I am wrong, but it's a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:04:56


They day will come when we are long gone, if ever. Peter is part of 1 of the 2 groups who shill bitcoin. He owns a lot so says whatever tf he thinks will result in a price increase (DoucheLord Lee and those other losers are in the same boat). He doesn't give af about bitcoin other than it's in his best interest for it to go up (nobody actually knows anything about this market cause it's all fake.) The other half of "believers" are paid to post positive news (shill) targeted to reel in dreamers and keep their hopes alive.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:39:24
Leverage is the source of the whales power. Don't feed them.
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:48:29


Hodlers love bitcoin because they have positions correlated to personal gain as the price increases. That is the one and only reason. Nobody gives a fuck about how it works (most people, like 90%, have not even read the white paper) and as the internet was flooded with pictures of lambos and stories of overnight millionaires, everyone believed it.
Most of the coins are controlled by a few entities along with the exchanges, who manipulate the market by liquidating shorts (which benefits exchanges such as BitMex) or increasing their positions (when a whale drops a huge candle and immediately rebuys the coins at a lower price.) Most of the news and posts you see predicting 100k future values are made by people who are being paid to shill and keep that shred of hope that one of us comes out with a success story. There are no institutional investors waiting to jump in (lol, can you imagine a legit company investing peoples money in crypto? No, because they know it's a scam and will never risk their companies reputation in a fake market like this one.)
My point is that it's bullshit; bullshit that feeds off human greed and make-believe dreams. The exchanges and whales are the only people making any real money off the masses gambling (especially from leveraging bets) and they don't want any friends. They control the price and will not allow it to get too high again, as too much attention will lead to regulation and outside attention. None of the points you presented in your statement apply here, because this is not a real market and is not effected by world events or global economic swings.
After a few years in this space, I sold my positions a few weeks ago after breaking even and being slightly in the green.  I know my opinion is unpopular around here, but take a minute, open your eyes, and look closely. Nobody is getting rich overnight except for the few people in control and the exchanges. Any answer to your question will certainly have holes in it. Tell your 60 year old neighbor to invest her $ elsewhere cause she'll need it through senior life.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:58:30
They have made over a Billion $ in the past 3 months. Search BitMex in this sub and see how many times this same post has been made. Welcome to the scam.
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:57:55
Because after all this time, people still haven't realized it's all just a big scam dominated by a handful of whales and exchanges who remain anonymous, control almost all of the coin supply, and manipulate everything from the news websites to the shill posts on Reddit. The most beautiful execution in history.
@_date: 2019-08-24 10:49:07
Thats because most bitcoin dreamers hold coins on exchanges, yielding over the power to fluctuate prices whenever the fuck they please. When enough of you idiots take a certain L/S position, the market (out of the blue) always seems to takes a sharp turn the other direction liquidating 200M+ in orders every time. The funniest thing is that no one seems to catch on as you dumbfucks believe the shill posts that "it's a natural correction" or" healthy dip." Buy the dip posts pop up everywhere, when in reality they are using your own coins to manipulate the markets and taking  your money through liquidation. 
People who are stupid enough to still buy into this scam after all this time won't become rich off it. The other half, the really stupid fucks who leverage positions, get double fucked by exchanges using their coins to pump and dump the market into liquidating their positions. Open your eyes and read a fucking graph - literally any bitcoin chart will scream scam all over because its all manipulation and scam based.
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:43:22
I realized what was going on a while ago, sold all my positions, and got out of crypto maybe 3% above principal. Consider myself lucky, and now, I could honestly care less because what grown adults chose to invest in is their personal business and none of mine. But, watching people get their money jacked by a scam, when the reality is right under their noses should tick everyone off by principal alone. It's not the rich who are getting jacked, its the people who cant get bank accounts and college kids trying to get dream rich as the fake shill ads about bitcoin make it seem possible. It's not. 
You might be the 4th person to catch on. The train was awesome, but you'll find me kicking it with Jordan Tate on the boat. I'll send your regards to Admiral Bates next time I speak with him. Good luck out there bro. Get out while you can, but if you choose to stay in, don't ever fuckin leverage (margin trade).
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:12:23


This dumbfuck beautifully illustrates my point. "Didn't you know its artificial. Everyone knows that" "Oh, and the stock market isn't manipulated right?" "Every market has whales." People fall for this kind of shit all the time in effort to justify their fantasy. Open your eyes brother.

@_date: 2019-06-03 16:13:18
We'll see about that. 15 minutes is an eternity in crypto, a decade is eons. When people realize that the entire crypto universe is dominated by a few exchanges and manipulators whose focus is to fish stops and futures targets it'll all come to an end. People are too stupid to realize it right now cause they are stuck in the dream that they might be able to outsmart the rich and make some money.
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:06:40
Listen up you fantasy land, lambo for nothing, dreaming bozos... ***Anything in the world that has a limited supply and is controlled, owned, or held by entities who have the ability to remain anonymous while transacting is a fucking scam. Plain and simple. This setup is literally the textbook definition of a scam***. 
Those dips you idiots call whales, or whatever the fuck you think causes them... Take a minute away from your daydreams of digital riches and line them up with Short and Long leveraged liquidation times from any of the major exchanges outside of the United States  (BitMex, Bitfinex, etc.) You will find a pattern that reveals the spikes and dips of certain coins will line up precisely when leverage is heavy on one side or the other. I would say read any bitcoin chart and watch how the price drops and shoots up at exactly the same time (textbook discount wash), but if you are stupid enough to still think bitcoin isn't all bullshit, you probably can't even read.
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:19:38
Unpopular Fact - BTC is a scam. Unbelievable you morons haven't realized that yet.
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:10:28
Yeah, hes not gonna drop it to 6k, at least not just yet. He's gonna go to 7500 in the next hour or 2, but the move is to  bleed this one out slowly because people keep on trying to time the dips and its much more profitable this way.
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:33:47
We were never in a bull rally to begin with bro. Ever since a few weeks back when this "run" thing began, it was all fake. The same person was moving the same money in and out in effort to get everyone excited and trading again.  Once the media and everyone bit and got excited about Bitcoin again, he knew he could start fishing their stops. So, he did and made a zillion dollars.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:16:23
Hey Rodger, thanks for your time. I have 2 questions is in regards to the "correction" that took place yesterday:
It has been reported by multiple websites that a 5000 BTC sell order triggered the roughly 15% "correction" yesterday. This order, placed on Binance, filled the last portion of its sale at around 6,300, while the price of BTC on Bitfinex failed to break 7k and Coinbase (which I was personally trading on at the time) barely broke 6800. 
My ***first question is, why would somebody do that?*** Why would somebody allow a portion of their holdings to sell at 6300 when they could have sold on any other market for at least $700 more per coin - or better yet, why not just set up a sell wall at 8300 (where BTC was trading before the dip)? This individual or entity literally sacrificed 100s of thousands of dollars by allowing the sale of some of their coins to fill 15-20% below market value at the time. 
To me, this is clear market manipulation. This person was most likely buying back their own coins at a much cheaper rate while increasing their position, all due a crash orchestrated by themselves. There is no other reasonable explanation for this type of trading behavior. ***My second question is,*** with this type of action and manipulation thriving unquestioned and without anyone being able to do anything about it, ***how does one expect rational traders or educated people to invest their money into crypto and expand BTC adoption when events such as yesterdays suggest that the market is in fact manipulated and controlled?***
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:23:37


Thats exactly what my entire message was about. These companies make it seem that this is so. Not yet. Not even close. Marketing "Bitcoin is now accepted at over 500 stores" is bullfuck at this point in time. 


Yes, of course. Not only would the daily volume movement of Bitcoin increase (mega), but cryptocurrency as a while would be more pronounced; signs at the register of markets or stores, on windows, saying this place or that place accepts Bitcoin. People who aren't on Reddit would be brought face to face with crypto transactions in their daily lives. Foundational for adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:11:14
Have you not seen the "BTC now accepted at 100's of retailers" posts all over the boards? What are you talking about. 
Took away the bold for ya.
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:40:24
Honest answer - manipulation. Whoever sold those 5000 BTC yesterday did so at a price 20% less than market value. The end of that order was filled at 6300 on Bitstamp where the price of BTC was at least 7k on other major exchanges. Why would he do that, give up 100s of thousands of dollars? Because he was buying up his own coins at a cheaper rate and boosting his position. This behavior is cyclical and every time it makes their portfolio stronger and stronger. It's never gonna end. I know its the unpopular opinion but people who are blind to the fact that this market will never grow naturally are just that. Blind. And soon to be broke. Everybody cant get rich, thats not how the world works. 
Actually, if your lucky enough to be paying close attention every time the price goes up you may be able to time it and make a profit. But natural growth, that ship has sailed and all the smart money knows it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:30:11
For sure, agreed. But if you recall, the real heat picked up after 10k. If I remember correctly, we broke from 10-12 or 11-13 in literally 48 hours. By this point, Bitcoin was already all over the news and shit, and thats when the people on the sides dove in balls deep. Between like 13k to 20k, all the way down to 3500, their villages all got burned down. All of us who have been in since 2014 (pre late 2015) knew it would recover in time, but those dudes who sat in envy all the way up to 11 or 12k and then dove in got absolutely rekt.
The momentum at that point was so huge that it crushed everyone who knew about the space at the time. 1.5 years later, a new crop of get rich quick people have formed and the cycle will repeat itself. Thats why I feel like all these instances are straight manipulation, as people who would inject fresh $ into the market are burned out and jaded. Needless to say, thats just my personal opinion.
I also think cost avg. long term is the best strategy, bar none.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:05:05
Fuck me in the goat ass. Yeah, you're absolutely right. They are increasing their positions.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:03:17
Hahaha. Good one. Fuck Wells Fargo. I would love to see them get burned down mega, maybe even more than watching Bitcoin break 20k again. And I'll lose my mind in stokedness when it breaks 20k again!
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:28:07


Exiting the market at 20% less than market value is not an example of supply and demand. I'm not sure what your motivation is but what happened yesterday is clear as day. You have your right to have your own opinion, but this kind of thing doesn't just stop; its cyclical and its only a matter of time before that entity or whoever decides the momentum or market is high enough for him to crash it down again. Only this time, with double portfolio only to double every time.
Your shill is off the charts my friend. The one thing you do have on your side is that there are enough people actually stupid enough to believe you. Unfortunate for them, but it is their own fault.
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:42:35
BitMex made 207mm off of this dip in long liquidations. Funny how the 5k sell order was on the exchange that equates 50% of the BitMex price which slid to 6100 when Bitfinex didn't fall below 7k. Coincidence? I don't know.
I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I don't believe in UFOs and shit but when that dude posted his Medium article about "the cartel" or whatever last year, it struck a nerve with me. Bitcoin is global and the world does not work in a way that allows everyone to get rich. When the market makes 30b in less than 24 hours, what stops that kind of momentum? If whoever dumped yesterday didn't do so, God knows where we would be right now. Same w/ what happened at 20k. The momentum was incredible, but someone had to come fuck it up.
The thing I dont understand is why wouldn't the whale wait and sell higher? Yesterdays drop order finished w/ some BTC sold at 6300 when the rest of the market was well over 8k. Why would someone do that and purposely lose potential profit? Why not just make a sell wall at 8,400? I'm not sure how to explain that. No one will be able to prove manipulation in a unregulated market place and its just something we need to be aware of and accept if we want to fuck around in this space.
@_date: 2019-05-16 08:55:54
No it isn't. I just went to the Whole Foods 5 minutes away from my house yesterday and asked both the cashier and store manager if I could pay with Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency (I asked both people both ways). 
They had no idea what the fuck I was talking about. 
I paid (overpaid cause that store is an outrageous ripoff) with my debit card and left.

You are absolutely right but I'm not going to try and deal with it. I learned my lesson already. Every single trade is not manipulation. That's just nonsense. 
Thanks for fact checking the exchange. I stand corrected.
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:22:06
Can't wait for the day they accept BTC straight from my wallet. That'll be the day for all of us.
Until then, I do not consider any 3rd party or card exchange service to be actually "paying with bitcoin."

Bro, correct me if I am wrong please:
ATT gives me a QR code which I send my BTC/BCH too. This QR code is, in actually, a Bitpay address. Bitpay then takes my Cryptocurrency deposit, converts it into fiat, charges me a nominal fee for the service, and ATT gets then get paid in fiat.
What basis of my original statement is that ***at no point does ATT own a wallet which I deposit my BTC into***. ATT never handles cryptocurrency of any kind. Through their processing arrangement, with Bitpay, I am able to use my crypto but as far as ATT is concerned, my bill or whatever is paid in fiat.
Is this accurate?
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:25:43
No I am not. These companies are making it seem like Bitcoin adoption has hit the retail sector when in fact it's no more than a 3rd party currency exchange who will probably charge a fee that would not exist if Bitcoin was actually accepted.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:38:15
Thats actually what I thought, just like all the rest of these "I used to be on Wall St and have a billion $" cocksuckers who have no idea what the fuck they are talking about other than shilling their own interests.

@_date: 2019-05-16 08:07:07
When I saw the huge transfers to the exchanges about 12 hours or so ago, I thought there was going to be a big drop. It was from the 15th biggest wallet holder (or something like that) to different exchange wallets. However, it seems as if they are just blocking / maintaining growth instead. 
My answer to you is why not? Who is going to stop them from doing whatever the fuck they want? No one. Personally, I have accepted that in the short to mid-term future, the entire market is going to be manipulated by a few entities or the exchanges short squeezing and there isn't a thing we can do to prove or stop it. I also have accepted that I am the unpopular opinion because everyone around here seems to justify whatever happens as natural / normal regardless of how it may seem. I really hope I am wrong, but we will see.

The difference is that these processors are making it seem as if main stream adoption has reached a point that is no where near where we are today. 
My Ma has no idea what bitcoin is. If she saw someone pay with Bitcoin at Starbucks or the grocery store, she might. More people would be exposed to Cryptocurrency and boost the entire market as a whole. Is that not one of many goals in Bitcons future? 
My quarrel is not with the payment or the processor, it's with the false image of adoption and acceptance that these processors are marketing to people and its garbage. 
Starbucks does not accept Bitcoin. Bitpay does.

I personally think (unpopular opinion) that the exchanges are responsible for most of the short squeezes and price manipulation we have been seeing for a while, so I read up on shit like this cause I am skeptical of them. 
Apparently, what happened was that the dude who owned the shorts "claimed" them. He sent / funded enough BTC into his account to pay for and cover all the shorts and in turn, own the bitcoin. Thats why they all closed at once like that. Not sure if thats the truth or not, but thats what I read and it does make sense.
