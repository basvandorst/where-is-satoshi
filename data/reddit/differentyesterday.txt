The more you talk about something, the more of a household name it becomes and sticks in people's heads as something that exists. Better to just let BCash fade into obscurity.

...and any sites that don't 100% support this Coca-Cola Soda come under DDOS attacks until they do.

Well yeah, if my bank starts charging me too much for the privilege of using them (even though they're the ones making money off of my money?) then i'm going to stop using them.

Exactly, I laughed at:


Ooh I bet ISIS are shaking their fists at the fact they have to follow these new rules now

That's my point though. Wealthy investors that are just in it for the money don't give a shit about hodling Bitcoin. They made an investment that paid off x5 and then took the money and invested it in something else. They may buy back in one day, but only after they've analysed the market and it looks like a good time to do so, from an investing viewpoint.

What makes you say that? I'd assume that anyone who's just in it for the money plans to dump once the market has pumped sufficiently.

Better than Roger Ver constantly claiming that he's the 'CEO of Bitcoin' lol

Is there a chance that a network error or someone making a genuine mistake could lose their funds in that case though? Being a decentralized network, who would they complain to to resolve their loss and get their money back?

Australia's biggest(?) crypto exchange BTCmarkets just added Segwit as well. Not sure how many people are trading at the moment, but it should help make a difference too.

But I'd say even more so with Coinbase as they've basically shown the world that they are shady fucks and don't care that anyone knows it.

The problem is, it's not surviving on it's own merits. It's surviving because he goes on TV and calls himself the CEO of Bitcoin and shills BCH to keep it relevant.

Bread should not even be mentioned on that list. Doubt it's coming any time soon.

It will only stabilise once they have all been mined and it becomes a bit more mainstream. The only reason it's so wild at the moment is because people are only just hearing about it and jumping on and off the bandwagon.

So he didn't leave all his cards behind
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:59:46
Ah yes but what about the Zune?
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:48:55
Such a great system
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:56:38
I pretty much guessed that a couple of months ago when they stopped mentioning Segwit and started pushing their own Bread token instead.

Quick question; is Bitcoin classed as money by the US gov? Doesn't the IRS class it as an asset? So how is it any different from selling rare Pokémon cards or something?
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:47:28
Hmm maybe. I only got one 6 years ago, but you didn't have to then either.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:56:39
But he's the CEO of Bitcoin(.com)!

Why are you spontaneously going to a Bitcoin ATM on a night out? And why do you keep going back if you keep getting mugged? Also, have you told the police? Holding someone up at a Bitcoin ATM is no different to holding someone up at a regular cash ATM.
