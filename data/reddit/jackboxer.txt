You got confirmed finally. Congratulations! How many blocks did you wait? I had a tx I submitted after yours with economical fees and it took 33 blocks and about 5 hours to get into a block.

They want $30 extra for shipping. Won't ship by cheap method. That makes the deal a no go.

I bought two of these for testing. Fast shipping and delivery from China. Set them up using the Trezor website. So far they are working good. Looking forward to multi-sig address firmware update.

When will you have multi sig compatible firmware? Also, if I buy the current version when you have multi sig firmware can I update this version or will it only be compatible with new hardware?

Shipping is $30 for one unit or more units. If only buying one shipping costs more than the device itself. Need less expensive shipping options.

How do you buy these if you are not in China? The buying page is in Chinese only? Do you ship to other countries and what is price in Euros or USD?

Both MyTrezor and BWallet websites recognize the BWallet device. I set one up using MyTrezor, not the BWallet site. But then I went to BWallet site and it recognized the already setup BWallet device, which was set up on the MyTrezor website. It does work and much cheaper than Trezor. I don't have much bitcoin but I also do not want to lose what I have. For my small holdings, a genuine Trezor device was simply to expensive a purchase. BWallet is at a more acceptable price point than Trezor. It seems Trezor is positioned in the market only for people with deep bitcoin pockets. It is a shame Trezor is so expensive, because I believe if it was priced more affordably many more people would adopt it for use.

The first one at Kido 2 Cafe in Bangkok is no longer operational so we only have one now. Tied with you.
