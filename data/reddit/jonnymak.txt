Currently because people are too concerned with making fast money, adoption of segwit is painfully slow. Developers are busy working on solutions. Developing easy interfaces for regular people to use Bitcoin, segwit and lightning but the roll out takes time. We are talking about dealing with people's hard earned money. It's not something that can be rushed out. 
And the transactions on Bitcoin have grown a craaaazy amount in the past year. But if companies like coinbase adopted segwit, there would be a substantial drop in fees and time to process.

There's a number of things that can go wrong, but largely, when there are hard forks, you can't claim them and take advantage of the free money that you've just been given. BTC has the most hard forks so you can get some nice free money. Liquidate the new forks and buy more Bitcoin!

Crypto might not be difficult for you to use. But try and explain to someone how to use it that doesn't know about it, isn't part of the community and watch how it flies over their head.

Essentially, as Bitcoin has layers built on it, the division of satoshi's can get smaller and smaller. Meaning that the value of your on-chain Bitcoin would get higher and higher. 
Just like there is a limited supply of gold that drives the price up, the same is true of Bitcoin. 
As more people irresponsibly lose Bitcoin, the responsible grow in value. Just like people that are irresponsible with their money lose value and those that buy stocks and assets increase theirs.

A phone that only charges you per second of usage. So that your bills are cheaper.
Streaming services where you bypass advertising by paying the creator directly for their content.

The reason this may work for a while is because people love "free money". I would love to see a streaming service like this use the lightning network. But that would require effort for most people to use. Really upset that PewDiePie is shilling this shit. A lot of people are going to get their hopes up about being paid in cryptocurrency to then realise that it isn't worth shit 5 years from now.

I'm going to create a new version of McDonald's because I don't like the direction of their burgers. 
I will call it, McDonaldss. I will use an identical logo, but change the colour. Then tell everyone that my McDonaldss is the real McDonaldss because I think that it fits with the vision of the original creator (regardless of the fact that he isn't around to say otherwise). 
Then I will subsequently slander McDonalds in a huge marketing campaign to grab as much market capital to make the value of McDonaldss stock go up. I will also buy huge amounts of McDonaldss stock to inflate the price and use that as a way to convince people that our value will go up. I will also start spending money to send people (this is a reference to TX's) to start going into McDonalds to buy the smallest value item as possible and subsequently slow down their service. 
I will then use their slower service as leverage to move people to my McDonaldss because my buildings are better and they don't fill up.
This sounds rather scammy to me.

Bitcoin core is BTC, but BCH has claimed so much so that if you go to and they redirect you to Trying to pose as something other than what you are is pretty scammy. 
Using the Twitter Bitcoin twitter handle and promoting bitcoincash is also a very underhanded thing to do. It's an act of trying to dupe people into the whole "we are the original Bitcoin" politics. But it's a hardforks, regardless of the political intention. 
This exact same conversation is happening on And it's a tremendous waste of everyone's time. I thought it was hilarious what the guy did. He probably did it for the shits and giggles and bcash are playing the victim. Which is hilarious to me when they have been attacked BTC and since their inception. 
It's suuuuuper hypocritical. I'm all for discussion, but the goal posts are constantly changing in these arguments whilst I am keeping the same fundamentals. Posing as something you're not, duping the public and slandering another project is childish. Then when it happens to BCH it's like the sky is falling and the community is screaming like feminists at the anniversary of trumps election. 
And if you think that VER wouldn't have done the same thing thing to BTC, he absolutely would have. Should this guy have stooped to his level? Probably not. Do I find it hilarious what he did and the reaction to it? Absolutely.

@_date: 2018-03-20 01:50:31
You realise what you are saying, right? BTC as in bitcoin. As in the longest chain, not a hardfork. It tracks back to the origins of Bitcoin. A consensus-driven, decentralized decision of where to take bitcoin, isn't bitcoin? If you have to hardfork the network, then you are going against the consensus of the network and creating something new.

They are already working to make this seemless without the end-user having to pay attention to their channels. The theory is, that if a node that you are connected to is down for a certain period, your node will automatically close that channel and reopen with another node without you having to do anything.

Don't take it seriously then
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:56:32
You pretty much answered your own question.
Just don't close the channel unless necessary. The more channels you have, the better connected you are and you should hopefully hit a point where you no longer have to open channels again. 
It's like moving money from your high fee account to your low fee account.
And once Autopilot is running in wallets, you won't even have to think about opening channels. It will just happen.

Just a quick look through the two reddits and it's quite blatant the BCH supporters like to attack BTC. 
I've said that both sides have relevant points in the scaling debate. 
As for the sending of payments via SMS. That is something I will look into and is definitely a very cool bonus!
As for lightning being a unicorn. It isn't. It works, it has been proven to work. It did require a leap of faith though. I will give you that.
It is a shame the rift that has been caused by the politics of the scaling debate and there is definitely actors on both sides that are culpable. But me personally, I see a lot of discussion on technology from Core and a look a shit talking from Cash. In fact, just look at Ver's twitter and it just straight up attacks Core.
I do think that in the long run, we will see which direction the market will go. People have freedom of choice with these things. I will be telling people about 2nd layer solutions and sidechains. And you will be telling them about 0conf TXs. Both are valid ways to scale. Both have pros and cons. 
Anyway, let's agree to disagree and hope that all of this back and forth doesn't lead to Ethereum just obliterating both of us.

Let's let BTC point the finger and hate. 
Ultimately a lot of companies will shoot themselves in the foot. I personally am not happy with Coinbase because my transaction fees are high. (I still don't have segwit from them)
Visa are charging extra money to buy crypto (an extra $5 per purchase). So I am no longer using them to buy crypto. They have now lost that juicy 3% transaction fee.
I don't want to use Bitpay because they charge a transaction fee. So what is the benefit over Visa in the long run?
I support projects that Blockstream are doing because they are actively trying to solve the issue of scaling.
I support BTCPay because they are allowing true peer-peer transactions. 
And the latest project I read about was Blockstreams satellite project to try and get bitcoin to areas of the world without a reliable internet connection. 
These are the fundamentals that I see in crypto and Bitcoin is actively working towards that. The companies trying to make fast money seem to have lost sight of it.

I just stated that I am not qualified to tear him apart as I don't have the technical knowledge to do so. But doing a presentation on Youtube without some there to plays devils advocate and explain holes in his reasoning means that his explanations go unchecked. This means that a lot of people will just take his word for it.
The part that makes me want someone to give an alternative point of view is where he talks about Cold Storage not existing on lightning. Which actually is idiotic, because you can still use the cold storage we use today. When he said that I was wondering, "hmmm how many other obvious holes are there in this presentation?"

I'll be honest. As stupid as it sounds, a bear market for a year might actually be a good thing for the tech development.
The whole full blocks and high fees were not good for bitcoin. The adoption rate surpassed the development. And good development is really hard. 
If we can have a year of good development allowing exchanges to update their backend technology to keep fees low, it means in the next hyped bull run, bitcoin will outshine the rest. I am personally rather happy for the price to be lower so that I can buy more in preparation for the next bull run, be it in a few months or a year or maybe even 2.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:29:31

I see what you did there
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:48:58
The reference is more to the branding and claiming themselves and the attacking of what they forked from.
And I make can comparisons to whatever I want. Don't be such a baby. You can either agree or disagree. I believe that it is disingenuous and it has clearly created a rift. There are lots of forks of bitcoin. Why do you think bitcoincash is the controversial one?
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:21:15
If that's your case, then why stop there? Why not go even further back through the commits and grab the code that is closest to Satoshi's last commit?
Consensus exists for a reason. And it keeps things more decentralized. 
Ultimately, anyone has the right to create a hardfork. But declaring it as "The true bitcoin" on the basis of, "because Satoshi said so" goes against the whole point of a decentralized, consensus-driven, open-source project in the first place. 
Why Bitcoin-cash rather than any of the other hardforks? Remember that Bitcoin Unlimited was a thing? With the same backers. That didn't go very well. So the process repeated.
Look, I don't want to argue this point after this comment because it is tiring. I understand the reasoning why people want to go to bitcoin-cash. I really do. But I fear that it is going to fall really far behind. 
Larger block sizes are fine as long as the adoption rate stays slow and the hardware improves faster than the network grows. But it completely ignores the poorer parts of the world. It makes transactions harder, mining harder and broadcasting the blockchain less reliable for those with less bandwidth. 
Not to mention, what happens if the blocks fill up and people vote for the blocks to not get bigger? Do you just hardfork again?
Let's imagine that doesn't become an issue... The first world will probably be fine with an increase in block size, but it doesn't increase the efficiency and it makes the barrier to entry harder (in terms of higher cost hardware to run nodes). The third world is so far behind us in regard to accessing our technology and they are the ones that need bitcoin more than any of us do. Forget about the price for a while, and let's get back to men with guns stealing your money. We here, on Reddit, are pretty safe. But most of the world isn't. They need this more than we do, so it is imperative that we keep the barrier of entry as low as possible. Making Bitcoin more efficient and multi-use allows for it to become a store of value, like gold. A blockchain that can be used for proof of ownership when it comes to land, medical records, etc etc. A way to trade and have commerce instantaneously and have the barrier of entry so low that we can bank the unbanked. Bitcoin isn't there yet, but it will be. The more efficiently it can do all of these things, the more people that can and will use it. 
Larger blocks increase not only the blockchain but the mempool also. Increasing the cost of bandwidth, storage and ram.
This all creates a higher likelihood that fewer people will run nodes and therefore mean that fewer people will signal what they want for the future of Bitcoin. These are all bad things.  
Blocks being full and fees being higher is a small price to pay in the short term for letting bitcoin become more efficient, more liquid, more decentralized, keep the barrier of entry low and allow more technology to be built on top of it. That will increase the network effect and increase the usefulness of the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Sidechains and second layer solutions help increase bitcoins effectiveness without compromising the barrier of entry (except for the temporary cost issue). Then if we hit a point where those other layers still don't keep the block size down, we can still increase the block size later. 
Anyway, you have the freedom to choose whichever blockchain you want. I've ranted about this for far too long and I admit that there is a possibility that I could very wrong about all of this. Maybe the adoption rate won't sky-rocket in the way I expect it to. And the block size increases wont matter. But I think it's doubtful.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:21:47
Sure they can. But it's disingenuous and so is their smear campaign. People lost their funds because they were sending to Bitcoin cash thinking that it was Bitcoin. And then when people say, "but we are the real Bitcoin!" It causes even more confusion. 
People have the freedom to choose to use whatever they like. I'm not going to stop them. But deliberately causing confusing and creating a smear campaign is pretty shitty move. 
Again, I'll make the point that consensus in Bitcoin exists for a reason. If all you want are lower fees and faster transactions, there are MANY alternatives and none of the then feel the need to call themselves Bitcoin. They stand on their merits, not by trying to steal an established name.

I am fine with that. But you're ignoring what is actually happening. 
Saying that it is Satoshi's original vision and that it is the most efficient way is also fine. 
Because these things are you expressing your opinion.
Feel free to discuss the scaling debate, the pros and the cons. Why a community felt let down and the alternative that happened. But don't start claiming to be the original when you are a hardfork. Don't hijack Twitter handles and try and dupe the public without educating them. 
Don't aggressively start slandering the people with a different vision to yours. And then if you do all of these things, don't get upset when it happens to you. 
I first heard about bitcoincash when VER spoke with Dave Rubin. And I liked his points. I believed in BCH. But then I looked at the pros and cons of the scaling debate. And then I saw how the community hate on BTC. And then I saw how there is deliberate misleading of the public. And then I was like, "nah, not for me. This is a disaster waiting to happen. This in-fighting isn't good for Bitcoin". 
Then I see the developments that are happening in BTC. The second layers, the pegging of side chains. The trying to get stable internet connection to the rest of the world. And I think, "this is a good wholesome path". A community that wants to keep things focused and on a good future. Not a community that wants to just shit on everything. Bitcoincash didn't fundamentally turn me away from it, the community did.
