I have Antminer S1's in hand and available to sell for .95 BTC. 
Paying fiat for preorders is insane, but I'm very happy with my bitcoin mining investment.

Isn't this the second one there? 
What's the deal with the one in the Thai restaurant?

[The US Secret Service recovered $156 million in counterfeit dollars and arrested 2,668 people for faking currency last year.

"testing"...

So he could watch it go to $400k? 
No reason to be greedy. Take the insane gains and be happy.

Im in the same boat. Can anyone recommend a bar near the House of Blues we can have a meet up at?

I think Coinbase/Bitpay/GoCoin should approach them as a payments processor partner so merchants don't have to set it up themselves, it comes preloaded on the machine.

I'm at a Starbucks now, I'm still waiting for my AirBNB host, who i'll meet at 230-3. Is there somewhere I can meet that'll be open around 315?

In the US you'll still need a MTL, at least to do this legally

The preparty event is 630 at House of Blues, Rise &amp; Rise of Bitcoin starts at 730. The conference is all day Saturday &amp; Sunday at McCormick place.

Not compared to Coinkite or any other standalone bitcoin POS.

He's really not making many friends in this industry. Everybody knows he ripped people off on ASICs, surprising he's being as public as he is with this acquisition.

Cause the 30,000 available werent enough?

I was wrong. It was my Verizon phone number, not Google voice. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:44:22
I did, they texted the code to me twice, and somehow they intercepted that.

When BTC-e sends the withdrawal email (which says to confirm or deny the withdrawal), it says the IP for the computer making the withdrawal. 
That's the IP i have. 
The email has been deleted, but i have the screenshot of it.

Because I assumed a text code through a wireless service provider(not the internet/gvoice) was secure.

No apps were installed after the jailbreak.

Different passwords. 
The transactions all came through at 00:00:23 on 12/25/13(according to the exchange), and he didn't clear the entire account...it rounded to the nearest whole number. 
Seems like a bot came through. It was a matter of 23 seconds before everything was traded and sent out of the account, including a gmail pw reset.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:41:14
The phone's been restored, how do you suggest I change the SSH password?
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:40:32
What are your suspicions?
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:28:28
Just checked. It wasn't the Google Voice number, it was my Verizon number, which must have been hacked.

I downloaded 3 things yesterday, 2 to a one week old MacbookPro:
 Dogecoin QT and Asteroid (CGminer for osx) and I jailbroke my iOS7 phone. 
It was one of those 3 things.

I had 2FA enabled. They had my email, and approved the confirmation. I got the login confirmation from btce, 2 seconds later got a withdraw confirmation, and then 2 different google security keys texted to me. Within 20 seconds my gmail password had been changed, they accepted the transaction, deleted the emails that said the ip, and logged out. I was able to get a screengrab of the ip through my phone.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:31:05
Yes. Gmail used a SMS 2FA, which went to my Verizon number(not google voice)
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:11:08
Is that possible? The API was running on a bot, but the bot was offline at the time.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:33:59
I didn't change the root password, and never connected to a public wifi in that time
