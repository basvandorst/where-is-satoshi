Holy crap the epic meltdown that happened in that thread!

Yes, I think that's the idea.  DACs (Distributed Autonomous Companies) sell their own currency to raise funds to support the developers and infrastructure.  So in order to do business, you have to convert Bitcoin to their own currency and use that to pay for their services.  So as a company, selling your own crypto currency is kind of like selling stock in the company.
I imagine a future where every company has its own cryptocurrency.

What's a faucet?

Just to be clear, you're saying anonymity should be built into the system?
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:28:33
I think it's kind of assholish, to be honest.

Thank you.  From my experience with Tinder, I was going to say, this guy either looks like a male model or is using fake pics.

And then he downvoted you for saying this.  What a bitch.
