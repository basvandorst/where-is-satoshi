PM me your info and I'll get in touch...
SWIM is a large BTC holder but I don't know if he would be interested in consulting.

It's all relative...$20,000 to you is an enormous amount to some and peanuts to others! Like some other guys here have said, only invest what you are willing to lose. 
For the record, personally I view the potential upsides to Bitcoin far more attractive than the downside of losing all that I have invested. However, I would never risk more than 25% of my total portfolio in one specific investment, let alone Bitcoin.

I agree, this seems to be the case to me as well. I will be very surprised if in the end that is not what happened.

Fontas would love that...

I bought up QRK during the hype and have made a decent amount of coin on paper, but it is going to bring me great pleasure to dump this bag along with the promoters in a couple of days.

I had cashed out to USD yesterday so I'm loving this, just looking for a good re-entry point now. 
I agree with jamisonia re: don't panic sell.

I thought the last line was going to read "you're gonna have a bad time"
