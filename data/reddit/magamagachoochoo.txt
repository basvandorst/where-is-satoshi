Wasn't bitcoin recently outlawed in India? Black market would explain higher prices.

Sadly people around here root for the unelected criminal cartel at the center of our government. Gulf of Tonkin, WMD's in Iraq, whisking the bin Laden family out of the US on the night of 9/11/2001 - and now they cheer these very same people because "Orange man bad!"

So you support the Mullahs in Iran? You wish death to Americans, Israelis and Jews worldwide, death to the Iranian peasants and other innocents? Rather shitty, don't you think? Perhaps you should re-evaluate those supposed beliefs you hold so dear. Clearly you don't actually believe any of them. Certainly not human rights. Certainly not any secular values. 
It definitely doesn't surprise me that a Socialist like you (and Hitler) would side with a former Nazi country to help kill the Jews. Liberalism always ends in mass graves.

Lmao Jack Dorsey is an open Communist who retweets articles about having a bloody Communist revolution. He's doubled down on the very censorship tactics that caused Twitter to decline year over year for the last 5 years. You wanna take financial advice from a guy like that?

Oh no... it's retarded :(

You're right. One side hates America, hates Israel, hates white people on a racial level, sides with ISIS, sides with North Korea, sides with Iran, sides with the EU. The other side supports Donald Trump. Thanks for clarifying.

He's a Marxist Democrat. He worked in the Obama White House (the same Obama who funded ISIS, Mexican gun running operations, used the IRS to target his political enemies, used the FBI to target his political enemies and on and on). So he literally is the swamp, he's not looking to drain it. 
His idea is to get rid of congressional phone lines facing the public and replace them with constituent messages on the blockchain. So instead of actually being bothered by constituents, politicians will now just be able to silently ignore us. I fail to see how that solves *any* problem.

To buy what? Socialism has ensured that the shelves in all the stores are empty. There are no products to sell. It's Holodomor levels of starvation down there.

Bcash survived Bitcoin at 5.9k though. I'm not a fan of the coin either, but it isn't going to disappear because of another 1k drop in btc.

It's low becuase people just want to be emotional and reactionary. They aren't interested in answers or solutions.

I just did this today, and the trick was using the mobile app for the verification. Phone camera is a lot sharper than my webcam.

Some people are just like that. I have less than 1% of my wealth in BTC, but I still check the price 3x a day. I have a 401k I can't even withdraw from for like another 40 years, but I still check it at least once a day. I have an ESPP I can't touch for as long as 3 years after I leave the company. Guess what I do every day? I check it. At least twice.

Those guys have been experimenting with blockchain for a few years now, though. At some point they'll start using it. It's inevitable.

China is delusional if they think the world will accept devalued Yuan as the reserve currency. Absolutely fucking delusional.

If this pic was taken this week, those prices are wildly inflated.

Hah, yeah I bought literally hours before it started diving. Womp womp. At least I know better than to sell and I can live without my initial investment. Sucks that I'll have to wait a while before I even break even, though.

This is my reasoning as well. If I'm wrong, I'm still hodling anyway so I still profit. If I'm right, I could snag more bitcoin for  $3000 or below the week of the fork.
