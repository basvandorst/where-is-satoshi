Lmao I have over 100k in crypto it was a total joke because the market has been down. I'm still up over 100% so idc it's a long term play. Don't get so salty over the short term trends.

I like to bucket my portfolios based on risk. I have a Roth 401k through work mainly index funds. I also have a personal Roth IRA that I pick individual stocks, all the major gaming companies, nvidia, box. Then my favorite portfolio is my crypto. Overall I have my 401k automated that way if I'm wrong about everything I will be ok. My Roth IRA I invest a lump sum every quarter and lastly my favorite one, my crypto portfolio I invest monthly.
Dollar averaging is the way to go if you get rich overnight it just means you took to much risk and most likely will lose it all. Over the 10, 20, 30 year period everyone that invests in the world will do very well.

Why would you spend what you precieve to be your most valuable asset
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:31:27
Safe to say all crypto assets are nothing but speculation. But ok
