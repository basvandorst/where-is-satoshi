I did a checkbook ira.  My ira funds are sitting in an account that I can use to buy most assets,  including bitcoin.   Irafinancialgroup.com  it was really easy 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:40:02
Can't happen, just like they cant close Facebook down.  In the end they will get on board also. With bitcoin it's easier and more profitable to join rather than fight. Win - win
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:49:21
I think they better let the people win this one, or the future could be really scary for people behind their gated communities

The country and the world needs bitcoin.  It's the only economic model that doesn't try to squeeze green from its failing middle and lower classes.  Bitcoin rises, value of currencies fall.  All of sudden 21 trillion in debt doesn't sound so bad.

Sure 5k, keep smoking

Not true.  I have a checkbook ira, I hold my own keys.

Haha.  Man this post and a lot of the people sound like the Christians that come to the atheist section.  Yes we've heard your words before, thanks for the advice.  Now in 2 weeks when it's back to 18k, delete your account or just create a new one and wait til the next dip to rewrite this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:18:34
How about this. They're buying now because they know they will never get a chance to buy at this price again. They've done the math, there  are only 12 million available and they have rich oil tycoons demanding large chunks of bitcoin. Get it now or maybe left short in dubai with only 10 coins when it hits a million
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:45:00
Haha, show me the correction.  There are people waiting for it to come back to 6k.  They might have been part of the 21 club, but no more, never again. Most people want as much bit coin as possible, of course, but after dealing in the reality that this thing can take off and never come back down, buy and hold.  Think of the stories of people who had 100 or 200 coins, now look at the stories we see today of people remembering they had a couple.  In one year, the stories will be of somebody who found an half of a coin.  See where we're going?

How about cell phone adoption , or 1 microwave in each home adoption.  Do they say the same thing when a new product hits the market?  You cannot compare bitcoins adoption rate with the market or other commodities, different monster.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:33:24
Still much faster to send bitcoin than gold by about 500 times, so I think we have time to grow
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:16:15
Safe is what wins when it comes to money. Bitcoin is the safest with the longest track record.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:33:03
I do find it funny people think big banks are going to crash bitcoin so they can gobble up the market.  It does not seem all that benifical because if they crash it to 3k lets say, I will by another 10 and so many more people I know will do the same.  At 12k I'm not sure to buy 2 more, but if I could have 10 more, sure. Also most people are holders, most bitcoins never move 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:55:24
If you think Bitcoin is going to a million dollars, I would be suspicious of you if you didn't own any
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:01:15
Haha, why is it when I read these posts, I imagine a Wallstreet banker with a cigar in his mouth.  They want your bitcoins, don't give them up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:42:50
Anyone who thinks bitcoin goes to 5 or 7 again is a fool.  We are bouncing on a trampoline and only going higher.  The number goes down because the amount of new people that just bought in are easily manipulated and they freak out easily.  The line to buy bitcoin is long, but the process is slow because of regulations.  If you could open the floodgates on this thing, who knows where we would be. Newbies are easy pickings to flee.  Watch bitcoin go down for 2 hours and then they start to crumble. Then they decide to research what is bitcoin, they see hundreds of magazine titles and news articles saying it's a bubble, they quickly sell to get past the panic of losing %5.  Wake up the next day, see it coming back and passing their sell point, they jump back in.  2 weeks from now, the panic is gone forever because we shoot past 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:31:54
Thank you. I hate these fucking posts about bitcoin correcting or pulling back.  People just talk out of their ass without doing any research. If you researched bitcoin you would understand that nobody knows what the fuck will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:12:55
If I just lost everything to bitcoin and it crashed to $100, I'd buy $5,000 worth.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:13:50
Really, haha.  So I bought bitcoin before I thought about its future? I studied the info, came to a conclusion and bought, probably same for them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:16:37
I'd say you're at with Bitcoin are way better than Vegas right now. Just be prepared to pull out if you have to, but I think you'll find after a week or two you'll be so far up everything will look fine

Whenever you read these posts, please remember the limited supply of bitcoin.  They want your bitcoin, they will spend the next 2 years getting every decimal place of it that they can.  Walk away for 6 months and quit believing fud.  They want you to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:00:36
I recon if bitcoin doesn't change the world of money, the world might change those few that do have it.  Just a prediction, not a threat. I'm a peaceful loving hippie, but I see the streets of america. A Fractional reserve system will never heal, just bleeds out. People are done with the old system, look they elected Donald trump and he still might have been the better choice,  ha. Fix the world by fixing money, they go hand in hand. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:33:48
Yeah because you know something, ha.  Man, you have to sit down and shut up along with the last 5 years of people saying the same shit.  Where is your crystal ball, where is your mathematical calculations? I'm sorry but you don't know shit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:14:32
I don't see why it's wrong to take the performance of the last 90 days and speculate that this will go to a million dollars.

We just went from .15% to .5% adoption, I think we have room to grow

People have to quit comparing bitcoin to past performances of other investment options, you can't measure it the same.  I can guarantee that   in 10 years there will be less talk about tulips.  All the next large financial vehicles with be compared to bitcoin in their potential.  
Please people, stop with the idea that bitcoin is set for a pullback, it unproven and gets quite old.  I spent the last 4 months going through the  bitcoin timeline, the chatter and news to go along with it.  It's like religon, or puppetry.  People keep repeating the same old bullshit and it keeps going up.  I can guarantee more people lost bitcoin because they read it's ready for a pullback, then sell on the first sign of a dip and boom bitcoin rockets off. Leaving them shorter or sometimes they get stubborn and keep repeating here that it pull back to 6k.  It might, but I would not bet on it.  Take some time and read about other exchanges around the world and to the effect that they are experiencing mass over load.  People are running to join this thing, but wait, what do I hear in the near distance?  A fucking train load more.
 If you can't feel the hum felt around the world I would suggest you put your bitcoin in a chest and forget about it for a couple years, you will thank me.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:38:05
Haha, that's when banks are involved.  Maybe they can help crash it from 100k to 90k when they finally get vested.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:44:46
You will lose decimals in the long run.  Seems meaningless maybe now, but this thing moves fast and if you are left behind, you will regret it.  Seriously.  Bitcoin went from 1k to 19k in one year. Everybody I know could have owned 1 last year, a few can this year and by next year, nobody will believe you have it. I know the idea of 1.000 in the long run doesn't mean much more than .999, but in your head it will,ha
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:22:28
The best vaults are the ones without the shiny dials.  8 years no penatration, feels like the safest place for my money.  I'm sure tech will fix the rest.  I had a 14.4 k modem 18 years ago and my 2mbs or ram cost 5 grand at one time.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:37:48
Wow so much hate for you guys. It seems like we be okay with people that are on board just like we are. Keep seeing too many of these Bitcoin cash guys bash everything about Bitcoin and it just drives me nuts. It's just another altcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:41
Here's the thing, if you got in the last month or two, you are sitting at 2x profit.  I know bitcoin falls, but rarely 2x and rarely that quickly, esp now with exchanges being backed up for weeks and people with money that can't get in quick eneogh.  The week hands are the people who bought in 3 days ago, just give it a couple more weeks and they will stand strong too.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:26:47
Bitcoin.  Lite coin is a toy with little support.  Bitcoin will be the best long term investment in history.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:46:07

@_date: 2017-12-12 15:24:58
Agree that this is not smart, but in the movies they would put it all on a number on the roulette table.  We have to agree, of all the bets you could make, bitcoin would be the best.

If there is a bubble at some point, it will be after the banks get involved.  They want your bitcoin now at the cheapest price they can get, lock it away and come back in a year.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:20:28
Haha I read this same statement 10 times a day and I want to say it reminds me of the Christian apologist that chime into the atheist reddit daily.  They live in this bubble that they have the truth and they can't believe we don't know about it.  I thank you for trying to dispell my delusion, but if you spend some time researching bitcoin you would understand and join us on this March to glory, haha.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:02:30
He is crazy smart, but also very certifiably out there.  That said, he is not pulling that number out of nowhere.  He might not be right, but I think he is.

100k !  Needs to only grow at 19% a month.  It did that every couple days.  Plus there bus loads coming along with big money.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:22:15
Ha, good point
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:51:18
I know I'm going against the grain, but why not. I believe in bitcoin, most of you do, so why shouldn't they?  If you are middle class and lower you have no chance of ever retiring well.  As it stands, you have 1000% better chance you will lose your house because of lost jobs, health and deflating dollar.  So maybe this one time, the stars aligned and there was this thing you could do, do you do it?  I'm not saying it's a good idea, but maybe it's something to people who have nothing already.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:03:00
I agree
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:02:48
I don't want to add to the conspiracy,  but I've cracked this code! Bitcoin, created by darpa, is here to solve the debt problem.  Create a currency that quickly takes the world by storm making millions of rich dorks along the way.  Devaluing the dollar and all world currencies , including commodities.  Making the 21 trillion we owe a fraction of the true cost in compared to bitcoin.  Money flows in and out daily as use continues, people finally start to save money.  Thus leaving all those early adopting dorks to go on massive spending sprees and reintroducing wealth back into depleted communities.  Governments pay back their measly debts from this new 22 trillion dollar economic engine. Ha  just my thoughts
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:36:33
What's funny about this is that I could not retrace my steps across some 30 or 40 exchanges with tons of losses and a few wins.  I had some invested long term and never moved it ,but I did go nuts for a few weeks with about 10% and I would like the transcripts to that if the irs has them! Ha

@_date: 2017-12-08 20:56:19
Another person who knows absolutely nothing about bitcoin.  Everyday for a year I read "it's due for a pullback", it gets so old.  It's due to do whatever the fuck it does, but you can't predict it.  Also, millions of people are flocking to bitcoin daily, tell me how it goes down and stays for more than a day.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:09:53
Yep, just like Internet, cellphones and fax machines.  Bitcoin is following  the same adoption trend.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:42:15
They want people afraid so they can accumulate  silently 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:45:03
Depends on cash or bitcoin.  If you are worried about cash, get out.  If you are more worried about losing the number of bitcoins, stay in.  You can take profit all day long from bitcoin if you want cash, but if you lose a decimal place in bitcoins, you'll regret it forever. And probably never get it back again.  This thing moves fast, when it goes, who knows
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:34
Just like when I started noticing microwaves in all my friends houses. I definitely knew there was a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:24:14
Yep, but this time maybe they are so devious and crazy, they made bitcoin.  How do you pay off a 21 trillion dollar debt, make a new currency that is worth ten times more.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:05:40
I'm buying because it's a real choice of putting my money in something that's not collapsing or controlled by the same people who brought you 2008.

No bubble!

Started moving my ira in august,  didn't get any  until late oct. Thought I would get about 30 in august to only having around 19.  Still feel very lucky to have gotten that.  Made 2x already, hoping for 3x by mid January . Funny when I moved it, fidelity salesman remarked about how good of a year it was, since I made 8%.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:17:43
This is a big deal and needs to be mentioned more.  I want all good projects and coins to succeed,  but bitcoin is the one that everyone is looking at.  8 years and no security problems, this is why it will be coin to be in for sure.

Haha, good luck.  I world is murmuring bitcoin, might just jump a grand tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:33:05
Agreed! Also, give bitcoin another successful year and mass adoption happens.  Best bet for poor and middle class so they will turn it into their savings, which would be a change. People with influence and money will compete to aquire. If I'm a billionaire and I'm convinced by this new industry, I will want some.  Not just 10 or a hundred, thousands.

Panic selling only effects small groups now because of the quick growth.  I bought some in late October.  You would have to cut bitcoins price in half and leave it there for 2 or 3 months for me to consider selling. People jumping on board now might be truer believers than the last 12 million, just a thought
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:26:29

You mean stumble, not pop.  Of course we think it will stumble, look how fast it was fucking running.  It will get up and take off again because it's the only way the future makes any sense.  Hear the people running?   Probably can't because of the noise of the bus loads coming up behind them. I hope the .1% who have the most realize we changed the game in less than a decade.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:05:30
Nope.  Brokers are being told by fat cat clients that they want a bunch of bitcoin. Problem is that this broker does not have a path to purchase 30 million worth without it jumping, like it is now.

Kraken is a criminal organization that's days are numbered.  Wait til the tether shit storm hits kraken. I'm trying to run away but they won't give me my money either.  I don't think they have the funds to cover all of those that are trying to cash out.  They probably learned from mt. Go and know they can file bankruptcy and keep it all
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:37:24

I had orders that I could not cancel  even after trying 10 times to only go away and come back an hour later and order at $500 above market price on a collapsing coin, so fuck them and jesspow, I hope he goes to jail or at least sued to fuck for continuing  to sign up new members while they steal people's money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:32
He is one of the reasons we got to this point.  Show me an economist that actually understood that maximizing profits on the backs of the poor and middle class might be bad for the world.  We currently have a system that could never be sustained and he is defending it like it was a child.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:24:52
Just like how everyone understands bearer bonds, 401ks and their ira's. Read it or don't read it, but my best advise is to walk away for 6 months and not look at anything people are saying about the price of bitcoin.  It's all wrong and just guesses.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:53:09
It's funny all the bullshit here. Bitcoin is the world's first lottery system and everyone that played has won, year after year.  So quit spewing shit and take off your genie hat.  If you want to help mankind, tell them to buy Bitcoin and buy as much as they can while they can.  For the average Joe they will never see a chance like this to get one step ahead of a failing world system.

@_date: 2017-11-27 13:18:41
90% of these people will buy from coin base and never move or touch their bit coin because they have no idea what they are doing and are afraid to fuck up. Everyone I talk to in person is using it like a lottery ticket.  They buy it and put it in the drawer and hopefully next year or next week it pays off
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:22:38
Ha. I am going to argue the opposite.   21 trillion in debt in the usa, rising health care and in 10 years the social programs in the USA are going to be larger than our GDP.  The government wants bitcoin. It will be the largest influx of money hitting our system in decades, if not ever. The true goverment, the one by the people, do not care what tender you use, just as long as you use it here. Even if it is for hookers and blow. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:03:28
The tiers are a lie on their website.  Take your teir, subtract 1 and that's the real policy. It's criminal that they lie about tier levels, lie about solvency and lie about their system being slow because of to many people. They should close their doors.  So in closing, if you want the benifits of tier2, you need to get approved for tier3.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:58:45
Haha, please don't buy the hype about a dip.  No one has a clue about the price of bitcoin because there has been no comparison. People waited for the dip at 5k and they are pissed now because they pulled. People need to quit trying to sound like they know what the fuck is up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:53:14
I'm not totally sure about the date, but bought someting like 1.1 to buy cannabis  seeds. Had like .2 left came back a year later to buy seeds and noticed that would purchase the same amount of seeds and ended up having something like .02 left.  Came back a year later and .02 would buy double the seeds.  Bought the seeds and the invested 80k 90 days ago. So, Fuck yeah for marrijauna,  it made me rich. Haha

I'm sure everybody here has read all the past posts with people claiming it's set to adjust, or a correction is coming.  Everybody has to agree that this thing does not react like anything we have ever seen and every prediction for a pullback has been way off.  I feel we escalate faster in the next 6 months because this is the only lottery that everyone in the world can play and right now everyone who has played, has won big.  Get ready for a billion new players because this is their only chance to not have to work at McDonald's when they are 70. No pensions, increasing health care cost, historically low wages and almost no retirement savings, they are going to flock here.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:17:46
