You need to sign-up to redeem your code, not sure if there are age restrictions for that process but you might want to find out before buying a code.

In order for the halving to actually be priced in, 100% of the miners need to be prepared for it and able to withstand a 50% reduction in volume.  This is not going to happen.  Many small miners will be priced out unless the price continues to rise.  That itself creates some interesting pressure points on the price.
    
Another way to look at it is if the price was already factored in, that would mean that we are paying twice its cost value right now.  Anyone who has priced mining hardware knows that isn't the case.
