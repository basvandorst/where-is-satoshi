Thank you for doing this! I hope you can support this project: preciousplastic.com
They encourage anyone to drop-off their plastic in the locations and turn them into useful stuff.
I'm not sure how and if they accept Bitcoin. If you ever plan on donating to them, I would personally try and help the equipement set up here in Cebu! This is very exciting!!

Thanks for the link to the post! I learned to stop checking the price every hour. Thanks for confirming my plan isn't stupid haha I'll be sure to stick to it and hope for the best.

Yep I was thinking that it may be hard to reach the 1 BTC goal unless I increase the amount. Will probably do this in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:00:19
I hope so! I'll check for monthly trends on when it's the best day to buy some BTC. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:12:16
I can't afford to buy that much and throw all my savings into BTC. I can only afford this every month.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:59:03
If I get a real job when I graduate I might try and increase the amount. Thanks for this! Will read more on buying with cost averaging. Been hearing about this for a while now.

Ooohhh I watched this before! Really great insight about how money came to be. Thanks for putting out great content.
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:27:34
Will never not upvote this.

Am I the only one mildly sad because none of my friends bought any bitcoin when I kept telling them about it a few months ago? We could have traveled together if only they bought even just a small amount. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:37:57
I'd also suggest you check out Exodus. But it's mostly for traders if you're into that. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:33:57
I wish my friends and I could celebrated together but reddit's fine hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:54:39
Hahahahaha this is so entertaining!

LMAO always a good idea to hire a hacker to test security. I guess I'm buying the Trezor. Lots of people seem to recommend it. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:27:07
Wow that was quick! Hahaha thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:02:42
I only plan to have Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:02:25
I always seem to buy bitcoin a day before the price drops. Happened last July and August. Happened again a few days ago. Dang it!
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:57:12
I will always and forever upvote posts with this GIF hahahahahaha

I also prefer it's design! Looks like a USB. The Trezor looks like a car remote hahaha
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:56:56
I like the rollercoaster one! Also I agree with one user here that having just the coin ridding it seems cool. Upvoted!

LMAO always my favorite gif
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:50:31
commenting to tag myself lmao
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:28:46
Oh this also sounds nice. Do you have any recommendation of a good lending bot I can try out?
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:05:48
You're right about my trading experiences hahaha I also think I'm a very emotional person and diving into this trading thing would stress me out so much. I plan on cashing out some money once this work is done (temporary as of now) and leaving some btc that I'm okay losing. Thanks very much for the tips!
