More like two days. I like my privacy and regularly reset. Do you not value anonymity?

Bitcoin cash makes a lot of us very happy. The only not happy people are the ones emotionally and economically invested in other solutions.

Try it yourself with a proper wallet. Blocks can go to 8mb, they're nowhere near full. The average means nothing except  wallets/users misconfigure their transactions.

If you use a proper wallet you get next block transactions almost every time using 1sat/byte. High fees only happens on bad fee estimations, based on calculations that assume blocks are full at 1mb. Try it yourself with a real wallet.

Ballpark of 18 months?

Increasing blocksize would basically take all arguments away from Bitcoin cash.

Dont you feel the least bit shameful when you just make stuff up like this?

I'm 0% BTC (sold everything), and I just wonder how lightning will make anything obsolete. It's a fairly complicated way of doing things and most importantly it requires you to plan ahead. 
Even if Lightning was scheduled to be released with v1.0 in perfect condition tomorrow, I wouldn't be particularly concerned for BCH or any other coin. I just dont understand what you think will happen to every other coin when/if lightning is released (and works as you describe)? 
Do you think that everyone will migrate back to BTC because of this when BCH has zero-conf for small transfers? Back to BTC because of all the great dAPPS? Back to BTC because.. why exactly?

How come all these guys calling bitcoin cash bcash such bros? I thought we were all neck beards..

Lol, Putin totally misunderstanding the entire decentralization ideal of crypto. He thinks this is a control system.
An easy mistake to make, but hopefully it'll cost the most autocratic dictator on European landmass dearly.

You a bro too, bro?

No, its the opposite of a control system. Decentralized means that no particular node has more power than others. There is no point to insert control at, or the network will self heal.
Early adopters have theoretical control sure, but if they do things the network dont like, it abandons them.
The only way he can "control" crypto is by setting up his own chains, like venezula.. but to make it powerful, he needs to trade with the rest of the crypto-sphere, and then he also needs to let go of his control.
There is literally no way he or for example Jihan can exert control, the moment they do, they kill the technology and everyone will run to the doors.

I keep doing what I've been doing the last six months, trade alts with my ethereum profits (future backbone for applications and AI) , invest principals back into bch and spendl it.
My bch stack was only 4x legacy bitcoin after fork due to bad calls, aiming for 8x.
When the markets catch up with the reality of unusable chains and coins, I'll be here with you all, triumphant.
