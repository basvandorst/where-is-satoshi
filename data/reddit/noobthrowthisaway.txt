Hes not wrong.
Capitalist countries are consistently the most progressive with regards to human rights.

I'm not seeing much of that tbh, but I didn't read the whole thread. I don't agree with that.


Yet, in most cases, it wasn't.


Because its a fair assumption. Just like you assumed I was advocating for raw, unregulated capitalism. 
Thats just how reddit conversations work, unfortunately. I'm glad you disagree with them, though.

What does that matter?
American lassies-faire capitalism is not the only kind of capitalism. Its still capitalism if there are large social safety nets and a regulated market.
They don't "regulate that capitalism". They regulate free markets that exist within capitalism. Its not semantics, there is a difference.


Countries move towards capitalism because its clear that capitalism provides the most wealth and better quality of life for its citizens. To call it an appeal to tradition would be to ignore the entirety of world history before capitalism. Its a relatively recent thing.
Its not like capitalism was exported to the rest of the world. These countries adopted it out of self interest.


Well, you're responding to a comment I made specifically in response to someone calling someone else a "bootlicker" for being pro-capitalist. So, i'll assume you implicitly agree with him unless you say otherwise.

They don't know what Socialism really is. They just like Bernie Sanders.
Scroll through this topic alone and count how many of these people don't realize that Norway is not actually Socialist.

By virtually any reasonable definition of Human Rights. I'm going by the definition given by the United Nations.
Capitalist countries like Canada and Norway are leagues ahead of China wrt human rights measured by any reasonable metric.
Capitalism is the dominant economic ideology in the world for a reason, and its not because people universally like being a "bootlicker". Which btw, is a term only used by American teenagers with Communist fetishes.

Socialism is an economic system of its own.
Having a capitalist system with social welfare does not make it partly socialist.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding.
The spectrum that you're talking about exists within capitalism, a country isn't %x socialist because it has social safety nets.
