In terms of price though, total market cap of gold is around $2 trillion and I believe USD is $20 trillion. So a 10x difference in price.

I'm actually surprised that BTC is now 1/277 USD. That's a lot!

[I'm really worried about the government banning bitcoin](

$100k per BTC. Fuck yeah 
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:30:14
If it becomes digital gold instead of digital cash, does that mean total market cap becomes $2T instead of $20T?

How would the attack be biological? 
@_date: 2017-01-31 22:07:59
Yeah, how did that not effect the price significantly ?

Haha so true. If the world's reserve currency crashes that means **shit's going down**

I believe the "unofficial" target rate is 2-3% because it gives people an incentive to spend, not because they're afraid if they miss it will lead to deflation.

Well the statistic of "Bitcoin has a higher market cap than 61% of currencies" is pretty useless, but if you quoted it in terms of the % of the world's population that lived in those countries, that might indicate something useful.
Wences Casares sells bitcoin with the story of how he's from Argentina, and Argentina has defaulted twice in the past 50 years.

But 0% inflation provides no incentive to spend. My money has just as much purchasing power in one year as it does right now. With low inflation at least your purchasing power is slightly eroded over time

How so?

That's what supply and demand curves are, they plot the number of people willing to buy and sell at different prices. Where the lines intersect (I.e. The number of people willing to sell = the number of people willing to buy) dictates the market price and quantity

How did it change your life?

Alt coins scare me. Hoping that BTC is not the MySpace of cryptocurrencies 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:04:11
Dang dude $70k? I put $3k in and I felt like that was a lot

Are you referring to [The Beardstown Ladies](

Where did you read about this? I'm interested in learning more about the philosophical foundations of money and cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:15:32
Nice, thanks dude. What are your thoughts on Xapo? I use them to store my BTC, and they don't allow purchase of eth
