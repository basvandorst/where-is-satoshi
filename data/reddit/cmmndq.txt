The thing people don't seem to understand is just how much manipulation there is in this market. Like, all the time. It's the big boys game and they make the rules.
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:52:38
Or maybe after we finish our free\-fall back to $6,000.
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:36:30
Yeah. I don't know how we're gonna get there, but until the masses use crypto regularly and represent a larger piece of the pie, I don't see how this could work.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:54:35
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:14:53
I'm not trying to defend that. Wouldn't S2X have done away with that too though?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:55:20
Right, but my point is that maybe it's not *all* dirty tactics. Maybe the market is fed up with things.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:47:25
No, not this. Bitcoin has some issues. We need to work on fixing them and getting more companies to implement segwit. Until something is fixed more and more people will head to bch.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:08:56
I doubt strong enough. The counter argument is "it's the real Bitcoin and still has Bitcoin in it's name."
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:21:21
Nice goin' Bill..[.](

It feels that way because it is that way. No one here should be trying to soothe your worries because you absolutely can wake up one day to find more than 10% of your investment lost.
The most sound advice around here seems to be, "Invest what you can afford to lose."
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:36:24
Yeah, pretty crazy. Coindesk even said we crossed $5k, but they don't seem to match most other prices.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:06:06
Maybe it's just me, but Schiff sounded pretty reasonable. Keiser on the other hand was just [talking over him]( despite Schiff obviously having a response to his argument.
Schiff is right in a sense. We can't all just hoard BTC and expect it to suddenly turn into a usable currency. The world has to change. The world has to want it even more badly than it currently does, and it has to see that it's easy to use. It will see this when we are making many transactions purely in BTC.
Schiff pointed out that you can pay for a lot of things with BTC, but Keiser countered that it's usually converted back to fiat. Unless things change, BTC isn't going to be anything more than a bubble.
So here's hoping things change.

Today is the day folks. $5,000 incoming.
EDIT: RIP the dream.
EDIT EDIT: Except Coindesk who claims we hit $5,013 USD.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:07:03
While you're right, I'm repeating the news that doesn't cause unrest. Unrest that is unfounded is a waste of time and makes our community look immature.
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:49:01
Wasn't sure what I was for a second being a pro BTC Jew...
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:56:08
How old are you? I'd say within 15-20 years it will start to be used by the masses.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:06:51
Can we please stop spouting this?
JP Morgan wasn't buying it for themselves. They were brokers for their customers who wanted it.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:48:04
No, I definitely wouldn't know the price if it weren't for this sub.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:48:32
Quick everyone! This is 110% confirmed!
Buy! Buy! Buy!
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:46:27
We've got some hours left. You just have to believe!
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:02:24
But is this worth posting? This sub needs to step it up.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:08:06
Uhuh. I take after you. Tiger.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:17:17
Too late. I already know the PlayStore updated an app.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:09:31
At $6,015 there's a [500 BTC sell wall]( on Gemini.
EDIT: RIP the wall.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:07:01
This isn't a regular conversation. It's a recorded debate and each person should speak with the intent to let both sides be clearly heard.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:48:36
Well if you believe the other argument is terrible, what would you expect the source to be?
You could watch an "unbiased" video about the issue, but it wouldn't fully convey their dislike of the core team.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:05:10
He's not trying to be rude. It's just a complex issue and he's encouraging the guy not to side with no2x simply because what he might have found on r/Bitcoin said 2x was bad.
You go to r/BTC, which according to this sub is literally just a propaganda sub for Roger Ver, and you get a very different story. Maybe it is a propaganda sub, but the people shouting it the loudest are all in this sub, so you have to take it with a grain of salt.
I believe 2x probably isn't best, but I've been trying to understand it for awhile now and still find it complex. It's only so simple when you limit yourself to one point of view.
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:53:02
And the government doesn't give this guy heat for doing this?  
I suppose that's a stupid question.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:10:41
If my comment steers us toward more intellectual discussions than I'd say it is worthwhile, yeah. Sure I can ignore it, but I think we can all agree there has been an ever increasing number of these types of posts. Ignoring them only makes them more prevalent.
Edit: I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound rude. Take this with a grain of salt. The fact that it's getting upvoted shows I'm in the minority.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:01:22
20 years is quite a long time for technology. I think that not only will people's interest increase, but Bitcoin will become more and more accessible over the years.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:46:53
Hey man, I'll send you a pizza gift card for it.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:55:34
Yeah. r/Bitcoin has much higher standards.
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:32:28
Wait. Why? People just don't know how to buy for themselves or don't want their personal info on an exchange? Why would you be able to sell people Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:26:49
Ah, yes. Here it is.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:25:46
Don't be stupid. They're 3d printed from files on the blockchain and then melted down again when you want to deposit them for fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:06:21
I think this might work a little better if you find one where the big kid isn't shoving the little one.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:04:18
Can confirm.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:41:25
Since you sound like you know what you're talking about, could you tell me if it's a safe idea to store my BTC in mycelium wallet? I'd like to have the private keys to split it after the fork, but don't know how to extract the private keys from mycelium.
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:12:39
Yeah, no.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:06:42
I'm out of the loop. Who is this guy? Not the BTC creator, I know, but who? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:43:56
This is a retarded mindset. The Bitcoin community as a whole shouldn't be fighting against itself. The best way to not act like children is to take the time to look at both sides and then choose what you believe.
For the record I'm anti 2x, but unlike some here I've looked at why some people are pro 2x and came to the conclusion myself. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:55:56
There's so much of this going both ways. Unless someone is extremely technically advanced and has an actual understanding of the code in each fork and what it will do, I don't think anyone can really know who's right.
Honestly, I'm pretty new to this and I've been kinda surprised at how petty the insults in both subs can be.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:11:01
Here's a very one sided view from r/Bitcoin. It makes a lot of sense, but you should go to r/BTC to see the other side of the story too.
 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:42:39
Weren't the Amazon rumors shown to be fluff?
