7% fee, this is a scam

IMHO, all considerations here about LN vs Blocksize increase are easy to reduce to a common denominator:
Is it really necessary to have every transaction (me buying an ice cream) settled on the public blockchain? Definitely not! Only settlement transaction should be there, and only for them transaction fees should be paid! Day to day transactions should be off-chain! Everything else would be totally counterintuitive. My cash transactions aren't registered anywhere, only when I withdraw cash from an ATM...
LN is an important step in the right direction of bitcoin. There will be wallets with support for that. For the normal user, the omission of fees (for everyday transactions) will be reason enough to switch to wallets, which support LN.
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:19:03
I hope this has major influence on bitcoin price, so one could buy cheaply...

if you bought a substantial amount of bitcoin at a price way below $ 1,000 it is really never enough with these pictures...
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:44:50
their business model is based on fees per transaction. so IMHO it is only natural, that in order to maximize their revenue more transactions need to be processed. Their thinking is to increase blocksize in order to do that. I am not so sure yet what business models LN service providers might have?

i think sequence number were never implemented. however LN is much more than what bitcoin offers out of the box. the whole channel management etc it is a hige sofware project in its own right...
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:45:03
i don't know what they are preparing for. if they embrace it yes otherwise no. i am not sure about the business models based on LN.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:27:25
i am hoping so much for an absolute crash! i have now money at hand and want to buy cheap for long term hodling.

great job. Will there ever be a 1.0.0 release?
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:26:54
LN will destroy bitpays business model from the ground up. it is time for new companies embracing the next revolution in bitcoin.

I have built a small app for accepting bitcoin at the point of sale:
The project is fully open sourced:
@_date: 2016-02-14 21:08:17

@_date: 2016-02-12 06:44:17
yes. LN uses features of bitcoin to make it work (e.g. payment channels). you can always use standard transactions...
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:56:56
You could either query electrum servers: 
Or implement the p2p protocol and use the so called spv mode. This requires a little bit of storage and access to tcp sockets, which i am not sure if this is possible in php. Altough somebody is working in this direction:  however this requires reactphp, as i understand...
javascript and phyton offers already more libraries for lightweight clients.
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:39:14
Are the stats correct?
This seem to be not so much turnover per month, what is made with btc. I think paying with bitcoin at the point of sale is still not very usable, as long one has to wait for the first confirmation... Off chain transactions will change this dramatically!

He is talking about Bitcoin as a single currency within a geographical region (as the gold standard was). Bitcoin is a parallel System of Payment (like he generally mentions at the end) and Bitcoin is not (and will not be) the only Cryptocurrency.

i think this analysis is not correct and not serious. litecoin blocks are almost empty compared to bitcoin. check the stats! this is not comparable.

I agree that there could be some kind of a decomposition on the functions of a currency. As there are 3 main functions: medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value; Bitcoin could be a unit of account on a global scale.
