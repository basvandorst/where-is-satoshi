I'm not going to lie it was stressful watching it decline every hour. I just kept reminding myself that this is a 2-3 year investment and after that I'll decide what I want to do. I'll stress about it later and enjoy myself for now

Why would I sell them now and lose more than 20% I'm planning to hold them long term

Yeah they don't advertise it I just asked. They wanted me to link social media acc for name verification. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:57:34
