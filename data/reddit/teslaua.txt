I had read that Carl Sagan was an inside codename for some Apple's OS version. Carl disliked that fact and sued Apple. He did not wanted his name attached to any particular piece of technology as I understood.

Ukraine, just where that soccer UEFA2012 thing happened recently.

What if you find yourself getting paid?
As if the malware shares some profit with you for your CPU cycles, memory and bandwidth.

There is FPS where you earn bitcoins by killing and loose them by dying.

Yep. That that is when the transmission of new concepts starts. Do they receive it well?

That sound like fantasy in my country.

Obviously my own shop sites.google.com/site/bitcoinua where I try to sell anything (in both meanings) to xUSSR

I am glad to help you. I have already ordered the seeds. My order is promised to be processed on Monday and delivery here is usually a day or two. I'll keep you informed.

I remember someone mentioning thing like that on bitcointalk. It got shunned because weddings are accepted as customs requiring non-strange gifts. Not so much for a birthday on the other hand. But still you can get unpopular when fiddling with people's customs, use with caution, friend.

Okay, here is my experience of trying to do the same as original author did - they are hesitant exactly as he put it.
And instead of thinking how to push it to them I tried to think their way.
Essentially I am offering them to use 'my own money' as they see that first. That is next to ridiculous all by itself and trying to convince them 'there are more shops!' and even whispering about you know what road does not nearly convinces them. The stigma of 'strange money' seem inherently stuck to bitcoin by design.
So... instead of exercising my rhetoric (as I see them) or blah-blah (as they see it) skill I decided to use more powerful persuasion - I show them how I buy cool stuff with Bitcoin. I got a small solar car on Bitmit which everyone loved and asked me to buy one more for them.
That I see the way to help wider adoption. [Practice what you preach]( and people follow.

I considered using OTC and i'm no stranger to console programs and pgp in general. But... its just so much hassle and I am lazy. So I just got everything done in two minutes on Bitcoinary. The only thing they lack is a geographic location tying like on localbitcoins.com

Yep. I think so too.

Couple of corrections about Ukraine - we use UAH, not RUB here. MTS (Ukrainian Mobile Communications Ukraine) lacks logo. Beeline bought Kyivstar and its all one company now. Would be nice to see CDMA operators like Intertelecom, PeopleNet and CDMAUkraine. And the term "area code" is somewhat strange to me. My number is +380(96)xxx-xx-xx so what should I enter?
