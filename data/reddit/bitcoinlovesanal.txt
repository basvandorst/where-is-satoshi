I second the other guy that replied: What *IS* wrong with being a pimp?
Not all pimps abuse their girls. In fact, many girls work with these guys because protection for a lone female is a major concern at times.
Then again, some pimps are complete shitbags...but don't refer to them as "human traffickers". Not all pimps are human traffickers...not by a long shot.
"Human trafficking" is a buzzword created by special interest groups and law enforcement to conjure images of Russian girls being put in cargo containers and shipped to the US from Moscow for purposes of forced sexual servitude. While this is a horrible, horrible thing...it is NOT the norm. Not by a long shot.
To compare your regular pimp to a REAL human trafficker is really, really misguided. But that doesn't stop LE from labeling ALL pimp/ho relationships as "human trafficking".
After all, the words "pimp/ho" doesn't elicit the same outraged response that "human trafficking" does.
More outrage = more attention = more media = more..you guessed it, FUNDING
Let the grown, consenting adults DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES HOW TO LIVE THEIR OWN FUCKING LIVES.
Now if someone is using kids or using people against their will...that's a different story. But how often is this the case? 1/100? 1/500?
You LE assholes aren't going to change the **worlds oldest profession** with your cracking down on this sort of thing. But do you know what you WILL do? **Endanger the lives of the women that are involved in this sort of trade.**
The more you push it underground, the dangerous it becomes for some of these women. I know you are all just the good guys..doing what Jesus Christ would do, but you are actually causing MORE HARM than good.
Not that your narrow-minded asses will EVER critically think long enough to ever realize this.
You should all be fucking ashamed of yourselves.
(On another note, I find it laughable, while LE tends to hate people that profit from the sex trade, or drug trade for that matter, they still do what they do for employment. I mean, isn't LE employment itself directly funded by the sex trade and/or drug trade? Would you have a job if neither existed? Don't you see this as PROFITING off illegal drugs and/or prostitution?)
Of course you don't..

They are trafficked girls.
You are an enabling rape and debauchery.
Jesus is crying thanks to you.
