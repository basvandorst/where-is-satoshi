Thanks for the information, I may just upgrade to a better Lazer printer since this isn't the only issue with my current printer and just use Lazer teslin.

I realize that but what I meant was what is the arguments AGAINST block size change? Just "I don't want to"?

What's your experience with them? I just got verified

Great video

If that's your opinion why do you hang out on Bitcoin forums?

Wow nice to hear from you I love the design of your wallets, one question I had was that I heard some JavaScript key generators have a chance to produce a public key and private key that don't match up if they are using an old protocol to generate them, is this true? Also does your site use the most recent protocol?

 I support Bitcoin NOT bch or it's founder .... But Other than it "not being a long term solution" what is the arguments again bugger block size?

That's doesn't answer the question though? Do you have to pay usd to the IRS after buying a good for service with Bitcoin?

Ok thank you for your help

When you buy coins via linking your coinbase account do they go straight to your bitpay wallet? I'm trying to save on transaction fees also how is the experience in general, another user was saying that the card is sometimes troublesome to load.

Hey there Jon the teslin I got was from IDCardSupply.com in the future I will be ordering from you guys since I've heard nice things. Thanks for the help and the model of printer I used was the hp deskjet 3632, the teslin I used was ij 1000wp , the ink was oem how ink

Print on teslin synthetic paper and use the tamper evident sealed  they end up looking pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:38:47
How do they implement that through bitpay?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:36:52
I'll see if I can link the comment I'm talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:40:18
Here you go, 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:48:59
Thanks, do you know any one that has one or do you?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:05:38
There also may be the possibility that I did not receive the correct teslin since I did not buy it direct from IDCardSupply I bought it from an eBay seller, taking your advice, if I printed on ts teslin in B&amp;W that should produce good results since I'll only be using pigmented ink? Also to answer your questions I let the print dry for around 2 hours before even touching it and when testing in water color stayed put where as black ink sort of ran off in little dots

There's an option in the bitpay app to buy btc through coinbase. Also thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:30:24
So it's not legit?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:12:57
That's the thing though I'm not comfortable storing coins on coinbase, I'd rather link my coinbase account so I can buy directly to a bitpay wallet since they let you choose your network fees instead of defaulting to a fee that's way too high like coinbase. This would make transferring to a paper wallet and vise versa cheaper.
