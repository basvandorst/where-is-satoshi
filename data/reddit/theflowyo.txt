All fair points, and to be honest, I’m not sure where I actually come out in this argument. 
I guess my main claim is just that the limited supply of BTC isn’t *that* big a selling point, or differentiation from current systems we have. It’s divisibility is at least similar to problems we currently have with fiat, though I appreciate it is not as large a problem as the ability to print money unhindered.

I’m not so sure, to be honest. Being as you can buy fractions of bitcoins (I think at least 8 decimal points out), isn’t there virtually an unlimited supply?  While there are X amount of bitcoins, there are infinite shares of bitcoin which can be purchased. 
Just to be clear I own some BTC as well as a few other cryptos, but I think of this whenever someone mentions the limited supply.

At some point though, gold/oil become too small/insignificant to achieve their purpose. No matter how small your amount of BTC is, it will always be able to function as a unit of value.

I guess my issue is: the limited supply of bitcoin should theoretically drive value over time because of basic principles like scarcity, supply &amp; demand, etc.  The fact that there is a limited supply of gold/diamonds/oil/iPhones/etc. drives he price. You compete with others at a price the market sets for an item, because you need that whole item. 
If a bitcoin is divisible, it isn’t scare. Most of the developed world will always be able to obtain *some* BTC. 
While I was writing this I also kind of realized that the limited supply still makes it consistently “difficult” or “competitive” to obtain any substantial amount, so I do see the value.
