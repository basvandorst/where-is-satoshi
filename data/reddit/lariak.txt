That's what I recommended to my co-worker. We got Christmas bonus's and he was wanting to invest a couple hundred. I said invest some of it now and some more after the weekend. Worst case scenario he loses a bit, but there is little chance it's going to have a HUGE spike over the weekend.

That is completely dependent upon who they are. If someone has no way to invest without other people catching wind of it, it can sway public opinion causing bitcoin to explode.
For instance. If warren buffet was to invest .01% of his wealth and someone found out about it.

Oh for sure. But there are enough people out there that are well regarded in the investment industry that if they started investing, it would raise enough eye-brows to cause others to invest. This could potentially create a cascade effect.
You are correct that there are very few people out there in the same situation as Warren Buffet who could directly influence the public.

Do some research about the Futures being released this weekend and decide for yourself if it's going to cause a more aggressive dip. If you think it will, then wait to invest until the dip hits.
Regardless, I (along with many others) am pretty confident that bitcoin will continue to rise. It will have dips here and there when people panic sell or large groups sell for whatever reason.
For all we know though, the future being released could cause it to spike.
I personally have a decent amount invested and am waiting until the next week to see how it goes before I invest more.

Also, asks why do you need MORE money? Make the kid learn about taxes. Take at least 15% off the top.

You mean the micro-bubble within the bubble, right? I think that's called a blip. Nobody cares about blips unless they are stoopid. Don't be stoopid.
