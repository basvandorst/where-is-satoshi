Well being a bitcoin user myself if I'm transacting in bitcoin it's very clear on my bank statements. 
However, if I'm in an exchange and I'm trading, that's an entirely different matter. What if this app. managed the trading aspect so for tax purposes, instead of manually keeping track of your trades, it handled all of the grunt work and gave you an exported excel sheet you could hand to your CPA?

For freelancers, it's perfect. We're building out multi-job functionality so you could track your finances for multiple gigs and know the total tax amount you owe, what bracket you're in and how you can lower it through deductions.
As far as people outside of the US, that's a tough one. Currently focusing on getting the product perfected for US taxes, then we'll start looking to expand out.

The app itself is intended to be a finance and tax app.
It actively manages your expenses and takes deductions based on your tax status (you choose), expenses, etc. 
It also shows you the exact tax bracket you're in, the actual tax percentage you owe, and has a mileage tracker.
I'm trying to think of the best use case for Bitcoin because he's very, very interested in making it happen but wary about the adoption if we use engineering resources.

Sweet! Thanks for the source @_date: 2015-01-20 16:25:23
We're 100% dead set on implementing for bitcoin and managing trading for tax purposes. We're going to wait a little longer to see finalized rules with taxes before doing anything.

Nah not finalized. It seems like there are laws in the books for the sake of laws being in the books. I don't know anyone who is actually claiming their bitcoins on taxes but I'm certainly thinking of claiming my goxcoins as a loss. :(

We've been debating adding bitcoin specific functionality for traders and users. He's not convinced that it's a good market opportunity. Maybe some reddit traffic might convince him.
