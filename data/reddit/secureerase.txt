I don't think so. Haven't seen any complain with proof.
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:38:12
Dunno, haven't had any problems with them ever, and the service suits me well by all means. All that complains on bittrust are just words without any proofs. As long as cex works for me, I am going to use it.

It would be interesting to know what percentage of the payments will come from Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:30:27
I don't think that it is possible without special software, bots etc. They give you too small money even insufficient for withdrawal
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:39:52
Not enough and too late lol. That said its never too late.
@_date: 2014-06-04 08:10:25
 combined with Armory wallet also an option.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:53:47
Yes keyboard warriors pat yourselves on the back for saving bitcoin by encouraging cyber terrorism and DDOS attacks. Don't you actually see the irony in your self congratulatory comments.....obviously not. Use crime to stop the 'evil pool' who have not done anything wrong except offer a better product than others.

And a few blocks late GHash only mines 3 out of 13 (308447 to 308460). Why no headline for that?
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:43:47
No I don't but I do use ghash for my mining. I haven't read all the detail in that thread which I will do, my thinking was more the 51%.  
@_date: 2014-07-10 00:03:33
Yes you did and that was 18 months ago. But what worked 18 months ago when Bitcoin was $30 and VC Money, ASICs etc were not part of the picture won't work today. The dynamics, motivations and business models are completely different.
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:47:11
Good job
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:18:48
Because Ghash.IO is a reputable and solid business, that Bitcoin topic is 4 months old and just speculation. They aggressively insured they didn't exceed 51% before and am sure would do so again.

How can anyone trade with any confidence on BTC-e after the 'flashcrash' rip-off a couple days back?
@_date: 2014-08-11 08:28:02
Yep similar conversation at bitcointalk, if you trade it there is profit to be had. Just buy and sit on GHS then don't expect returns, like anything in life you have to work it to get what you want.
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:46:04
Thanks to everyone for commenting to this situation, some interesting and thought provoking conversations.

Money talks
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:23:49
The numbers are massive
@_date: 2014-05-21 07:09:49
The upside with CEX is you can trade your GHS at anytime, so if you get the timing right as Jaxkr states you could profit from mining and trading combined. It's all about timing. I use them, it works for me as I like to trade.
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:30:41
Wow, looks great!
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:42:03
1 bidder took all the BTC for essentially 1 project (providing Vaurum with liquidity), so just like an IPO that is oversubscribed the value will inherently rise because demand exceeds supply.
It shows there is more demand for big blocks of BTC. The Feds have another 144K to offload, so hopefully same sort of outcomes will occur. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 04:47:54
Cool your jets keyboard warriors and wait for what they have to say rather than serving "your justice" 
@_date: 2014-10-21 03:31:18
Well the Foundation announced  Reddit AMA series on Oct 13th:
'We’re excited to announce that we’ve linked up with Reddit to host a series of AMA’s starting Tuesday, October 14. This is your chance to ask us anything!
First up will be Jim Harper, Global Policy Counsel. Catch him tomorrow on Tuesday, October 14 at 11 AM EST to ask him anything.'
So I assume it will be on Reddit again with Gavin?
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:52:12
Not this year no way. This current run needs some more trading volume (demand) to keep it going and currently volume is up but not hugely. $1,000 this year maybe........
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:00:25
Get your wallet out Tester24834 you are that rich guy!

I must have a museum too with my Antminer S3s ;-)
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:57:38
Hold some for long term, use some to buy stuff and pay for things. Just like you do with cash. The more we use it the wider it becomes accepted and the reasons for it to appreciate in value grow.
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:49:58
3 Reasons to not dump = Liquidity on Havelock very low. Spread between Bid and Ask = Large. Trend of recent price = Down.
@_date: 2014-10-12 04:49:23
Antminer, beer in that order ;-)
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:31:22
Virtually nothing has changed? Market cap $700m to $8B. Home computer GPU to Global hashing farms. Total hash power 50KGHs to 140MillionGHs. Unique BTC addresses 50K to 200K. Difficulty 4.8M to something insanely bigger. VC money? One company Xapo gets $40m in VC funding, I doubt even 10% of that was being handed out in March 2013 to the entire Bitcoin startups. One pool GHash in 6 months creates a product lots of miners want to use and becomes the largest pool.
Bitcoin has changed massively in that time whether that is good or bad depends on your point of view. Bitcoin has become a massive global industry, in March 2013 it certainly wasn't that.
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:27:42
Yes a classic support / resistance battleground. If it does break and stay above $500 then the trading range will be between $800 at the high and $500 area at the low.
@_date: 2014-05-30 02:18:57
I run a few Antminers and had planned a few months back to offload them around this time based on difficulty / profit forecasts. Reality is price of hardware has tumbled so much I bought some more. Sure block rewards are lower than in the past, but not enough to warrant stopping. If BTC price rises over the coming months as well mining remains a profitable endeavor.
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:04:52
You buy the GHS you want. That hashing power belongs to you and starts mining immediately.
CEX.IO have a tradeable market for GHS, so at any point you can sell your GHS. So you can mine for ASD long or as short as you want.
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:52:35
What I find interesting is that the only illegal thing to have transpired in this hysteria is the malicious DDOS attack on GHash launched by bedroom based cyber terrorists no doubt active on these threads who will probably be patting themselves on the back having " saved bitcoin" from something that hasn't happened.
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:39:25
Not another 'evil pool operator takes over Bitcoin network by masterminding hidden pool mining, double spend, short the Bitcoin price devilish plan'. Pleease. OP's dragging out 9 month old dead information that someone (same person?) tried unsuccessfully to drag out and shout about on bitcointalk recently. Whats the hidden agenda there?
I use GHash coz their features and service are good and do exactly what I want, why on earth would they want to attack the hand that feeds?
@_date: 2017-02-27 10:59:47
I prefer saving Bitcoins and not spending on stuff now, cause the price goes up. But some years ago, I bought some beer in Berlin for bitcoins, that was pretty cool
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:08:26
Yeah, lottery is the right word for that. I own Bitcoins and trade them, but still you never know what happens next.
What I think is necessary is to track Bitcoin price every single day and read news. I mean, if you own Bitcoin, it's hard to go to the mountains and disconnect, because you will think about the price every single step you make :D
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:33:29
Well, you can use it for trading, but it is quite risky. I'd leave them as they are and wait till the price goes up. Or buy more Bitcoins. 
Why did you actually decide to buy BTC? Did you have any aim?
@_date: 2017-02-20 11:04:34
seems like the calm before the storm. but bitcoin has always been unpredictable. you never know what comes next and from where.
but I am really happy we swam out from times of $200 per BTC, you know
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:02:39
yes, seems like Chinese are controlling bitcoin market, or at least they can move the price in the direction they want...
i already think we should track news from China
@_date: 2017-02-17 11:16:12
I once used CoinDesk, but they became more blockchain- and VC-oriented.
Now I mostly visit  or just use "bitcoin" keyword to find out something new on google or reddit (just using time preferences, such as "for the last 24 hours" or so). 
But, with over the past year, I am considering to follow Chinese financial news, you know :D They tend to influence Bitcoin price soooo much
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:12:02
No news is still good news :)
@_date: 2017-02-14 11:26:57
well, you can both get wallets and bitcoins to send and receive, but if your gf wants to eventually get money in usd, for example, consider choosing an exchange where she can convert btc into usd and withdraw funds. for example, cex.io offers cashing out to credit cards, that's one of the options. at least, it is quick
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:36:28
but it can then raise up to $2,000 in one month. will you regret it? :)
it all depends on your intentions towards bitcoin. if you buy btc at $1227 and sell at $1000, obviously, you'll have losses. if you wait till the price goes up and sell at a higher price, you'll profit. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:03:51
ok, and if the situation was vice versa? I mean, if this order would have been important for your buddy?
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:57:27
Yeah, man. Even if you buy half a bitcoin and it will later grow, it will already be a profit! 
I personally buy btc at cex.io, but I don't know what country you are from, and whether they operate there. Anyways, their geography is wider than coinbase, for example.
Good luck with buying and getting into the community
