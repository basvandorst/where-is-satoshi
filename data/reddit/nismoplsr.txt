That is just not true. I'm sure you've seen the Mopheus and Neo meme? Also, can you argue that price hype does not drive adoption rates at all?
I am not disagreeing that there will be a correction, and some people will react emotionally but that does not mean it's all about price for an entire subreddit.

OpenBazaar uses bitcoin, if you chose to use Coinbase for your bitcoin account well then that is on you.

Curious on this also. I forgot to pre-order the signed version. I just went to go do that and they are all sold out. So bummed.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:37:05
Maybe, but all those things being default are making people aware. With the recent NSA revelations, I think even more people are becoming cognizant of the need to be more secure. More people search out and expect HTTPS on sensitive websites. Apple's whole disk encryption on iPhones certainly has made the news a bunch recently.
The general public might not understand all the cryptography techniques behind it but they understand the importance and that should draw them towards bitcoin.

I will try the newest release tonight, but I ran into some roadblocks getting beta 1.0 setup on OSX 10.8 a couple months ago. I am pretty sure my underlying problem is a previous Idle IDE install I have.
So it was certainly too beta for me to figure out,  your results may vary. This newest release may also be a little smarter, though.

Doubt you would get paid if there were no "thanks" and everyone reported it as "no longer there".
Along with the accumulative reputation system it seems as though Waze already setup pretty good to prevent abuse.

So then there is actually a speed trap that I am warned about?

Ah cool. Understood about the multiple venues and how a ChangeTip based extension makes sense, but why not *also* incorporate into the RES extension?
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:11:10
Thanks for the interesting theories. If *The Wire* has taught me anything it is that the timing of the busts could be very political in nature; it is a bit coincidental that they occurred two days after election day.

Having "tip" built right into the options below a post right next to "reply" and "give gold" is a great idea. The bot is just a little too clunky and clutters threads even when the private option is used.
@_date: 2014-11-08 13:50:11
While I'm sure it is somewhere on the site, it isn't very obvious because I never noticed it.
It should at least show up as pending as soon as the transaction is propagated through the network.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:56:51
ChangeTip needs to be integrated into the below comment options via RES.
Currently all the clutter due to the bot may help awareness but it won't be long before even the most hardcore bitcoiners are going to get annoyed.
E: Looks like a [ChangeTip Chrome extension for Reddit already exists.](
I still push to have it built into RES extension as well. [feature request has been submitted.](

For credit and debit, sure. What do you guys have for gift cards, loyalty cards, etc., are they all contactless EMV?
What about where you work or live; do you have RFID cards?
This item does it all. I would be inclined to pick up one of these so I can cut down on the number of the above items I carry around daily.
I'll be using ApplePay, or whatever else the tokenized NFC payment system is beyond that, for any credit/debit and Bitcoin transactions wherever security is more critical.

A nice hardware wallet to store all your coins in.[How about a Trezor.](
Maybe, a soon to be released simple and secure paper wallet tool so you can spread your bitcoin wealth this holiday season. [Pre-order an Entropy from Mycelium.](
You can brush up on the technology by purchasing and reading Andreas Antonopouls' soon to be published book *Mastering Bicoin*.[I believe O'Reilly currently accepts or is working on accepting Bitcoin payments for when the book is published next month.](

I agree. Slick and snappy.
Initial setup flow was very well done and touch ID integration is great.

A DAT (Distributed Autonomous Teapot), if you will.

It is still **free money** to the receiver. It is also the *easiest* (for new / future bitcoiners) way to currently send free money around the globe instantly. For those two reasons, I believe ChangeTip is entitled to tip for their services.
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:18:29
I interpreted it as "There are 85% of the worlds transactions that we are not skimming off the top of." and "Bitcoin is threatening our stronghold on internet commerce.".

Can we get a translator for this!?
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:41:38
Can you give a quick explanation on the error? 
It's still a bit concerning that it was on the client side but we just have to take your word that it's *not* in the backend.
@_date: 2014-10-09 00:10:58
The site says it's software upgradable so I don't see why you couldn't load a QR onto it to receive payments.

You wouldn't have to pay the 3rd party fees that those companies charge. 
I don't know if Overstock has to pay a fee to Bitpay when they process transactions that stay as BTC, but either way this is one step closer to having a full loop BTC based economy.

Thanks for the reply. Those points are what I generally expected. So to your knowledge Amazon doesn't offer any sort of extra security for highly sensitive systems and nobody has successfully used them for it? Colocation seems like an obvious compromise but if the whole point of going to AWS in the first place was for dynamic scaling / usage based pricing one would seem to be without a solution.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:44:56
I'd argue that Myspace already killed Friendster. What drove Facebook adoption was twofold, the exclusivity and the cleanliness compared to HTMhell of Myspace. Either way, I agree that it wasn't that drastic of an improvement.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:48:23
I'm surprised you can still retrieve even BTC. I thought they were shutting down months ago. I thought they had given a date to withdraw by; nice to see that hasn't happened yet.

Well they didn't launch there own satellites. They are using an already existing set of geosynchronous communications satellites owned by various other companies. Obviously renting out however much bandwidth they need isn't free and it costs money to maintain the Blockstream transceiver SDR but let's not say they launched any hardware themselves.

Yea, except that function was broken the other day. First it was not able to read ID when I saw loading the same file as I recently did for GDAX. Then when I tried again the next day it wouldn't recognize my webcam for the face confirmation. Haven't tried again since.

I don't think it is a clear example of that. What else do we have to use for valuing bitcoin, should we use the Bic Mac index? Sure bitcoin is about more than how many cheeseburgers you could buy with it but it's point value directly correlates to the significance of the technology and adoption. We can look at wallet counts, transactions per second, stores/vendors accepting, etc., and we definitely do that too but it isn't as fun. I also don't think you can deny that hype and price speculation is going to accelerate adoption which will result in the actual end goal sooner.

Hash efficiency is also still increasing, probably will for the next couple years until some transistor limits are hit. I am not sure if the proposed work arounds for CPUs apply to ASICs. Hydro sourced electricity is cheap but probably won't continue to get cheaper like solar will.

That is interesting if you think of it as a slip-up, but becomes blurry when you realize a perceived Japanese person with the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" might just be the anglicized version of the typical Asian form of family name (Nakamoto) first, given name (Satoshi) second. You could also say this only reinforces the coincidence, or does it?
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:22:02
I think he was referring to true altcoins, they mostly follow Bitcoin trends up and down with some amount of scatter about it due to their own respective up and downs but the gross movements usually align. I think part of this being that unless you are mining the way to acquire altcoins is via exchange from BTC.

There was continuous consensus for those changes; enough entities believed it to be in good faith to the project and was required for development. So no, not fake. If you need to fork the chain to make changes in which there is not consensus on then it is the misaligned tine and is not appropriate to call it by the name of the master branch.
