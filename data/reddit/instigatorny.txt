Leah McGrath Goodman looks like she is on the verge of sleep deprivation. She absolutely stands by her story because Dorian Nakamoto stated "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it". I honestly feel like there is no way she can retract her story. I feel like this story was based on minimal evidence and who knows what the context was with her conversation. It is only her word I wish she recorded it.

Leah McGrath Goodman looks like she is on the verge of sleep deprivation. This video was hard to watch, she has to realize that her evidence is so absurd.

Trish Regan is gorgeous and her legs are insane. Also Tom Keene sounds like Marty Funkhouser from Curb Your Enthusiasm.
