Thanks man, do they support group chat function?

What is the goal of BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:31:56
Is this one of the reasons BTC use small blocks?

I wrote it as BSV, but the post was removed. So I typed it as **V&lt;-S&lt;-B**

It's not free to send messages. 1sat on the Lightning can be divided into 1000 pieces, so the price can be extreme cheap.
I don't think the spam is a problem. Because it's not free.

Are they custodial or none-custodial?

So, BTC is not for commerce? Then what are the scenes to use BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-23 04:35:15
Can you tell me more details about that project? Thanks.
@_date: 2019-11-23 04:56:59
Thanks, I guess we have to wait for the product to be mature and for the mass adoption.

Any ideas on how to build group chat apps on the lightning network?
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:09:21
Do you mean people should use VISA/MASTERCARD or other 3rd parties to spend BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:15:46
The reimbursement idea is great. I think it works.
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:05:32
If BTC's goal is not for massive adoption, how could it be used for commerce?
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:50:11
Yes, this can work. But here is one problem. If the group chat has a lot of people, the one who talks most has to spend lots of sats to send his message to the others, it's too expensive for him. And the one who never speaks, get the message and lots of free sats. 
If Larry talks too much, and the group chat has 1000 people. So every time he send a message in the group chat, he has to send 999 copies of it. 
It's not fair, I think everyone in the group chat should bear the fees.
Maybe he can only send it to Barry&amp; Harry, then Barray &amp; Harry pass the message to someone else, so gradually the message get to everybody.

If you Bitcoin can not be massively adopted, how can so many people Bitcoin at the same time?
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:26:40
Really, no one cares about V&lt;-S&lt;-B here?
I asked lots of question in its community.
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:47:47
1: Transactions on chain tops at 300,000+. Most people speculate it in exchange. that's the way they use it.
2: How many people do you think should use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-24 00:19:07
This solves the problem.
@_date: 2019-11-02 14:25:51
Thanks, then what helps to protect miners from govt control?
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:48:00
But 3\~7 transactions per second is too slow. It won't be possible for massive adoption.
Opening channel of LN also need to be on chain.
How to make bitcoin for massive adoption? Is this a goal for BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-02 14:57:38
English is not my mother language. I really don't get your point. Can you explain it with some easy words?
@_date: 2019-11-23 10:52:57
Yes, Lightning is a payment network, but messages can be attached on the payment. So one to one chat can be done.
I'm wondering how to do group chat on top of the Lightning network.
 A censorship resistant chat network build on the Lightning network. Don't you think that is very interesting. People love their privacy.
@_date: 2019-11-03 04:20:42
Can you post the link? What did he say?
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:50:57
Go, my friend.
