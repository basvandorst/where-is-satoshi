It's a great law, but it's sad that they don't realize it.

Oh, sure, that's absolutely the case. If you're not getting in on the ground floor, you're too damn late. If you *are* getting in there, though, you can ride it to the moon. The first people to get ASIC miners on SHA-256 made a mint. The same thing's going to happen for Scrypt here pretty soon: Alpha Technology is ramping up for their 90MH/s miner - I realize that might not sound like a lot on its face but it's pretty substantial, and those who're getting them *now* are the people who are going to capitalize -- *before* the difficulty shoots up.

I feel for you, man. I am eternally grateful I was able to pull mine out before Gox started fouling up hardcore.
On topic...my biggest regret is letting my parents (I lived at home at the time) harangue me about power use. This was when 6870s were pick of the litter for GPU mining. I could have made so much.

That doesn't change the fact that they're only trespassing once. You, in fact, would be guilty of property damage, since, as they weren't trespassing, you had no right to fell them.

You think literally everything else ever never had to deal with these sorts of problems in their infancy?

You can make duplicates and toss the duplicates in a safe, or a safe deposit box, or what have you. Also, some paper wallets support [BIP0038 private key encryption;]( *make sure to do this if supported.* What this means is that even if someone gets ahold of your paper wallet with the private key on it, it won't do them any good without the decryption passphrase. It's sort of like having a password for your password.

It's necessary, though. Without miners, your bitcoins are worthless because there's no transaction confirmation happening.

You mean once. [United States v Causby]( sets aside the previous British common law [*Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos*]( which had previously held. The short version is that you don't have rights to airspace above your property beyond what you can reasonably use. A drone fifty feet in the air? Sorry, bud. You're out of luck.

Building on top of what b44rt said, it's exactly like proving you sent a message using a PKE method. In fact, bitcoin is for all intents and purposes a modified implementation *of* PKE. The "bitcoin address" is the public key, the secret everyone knows. The private key is the secret you need to have in order to digitally sign the message and prove that the associated public key is yours. Hopefully, this explains *why* signing a transaction with another pre-shared secret establishes your ownership over the funds.

Well, consider this. Pay in Bitcoin for something that you can physically pick up and carry with you out of the store. Pay with a credit card for when you have to have faith that the merchant will send out the product. For right now, that seems like a pretty decent solution, no?

How did you lose it? Get wiped out by Gox, or stolen by an unscrupulous eBay denizen?
e: spelling!
@_date: 2014-07-24 10:42:43
Uh, what? Where do you get that? He said *some* are conducting illicit business. Not all. And there's certainly legitimate business happening with bitcoin -- Dish, Overstock, and Dell, among other corporations, happily accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:01:41
Uh. Is there a particular reason you're talking to yourself?
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:04:35
Clearly you do.

That's the fee for an instant buy off a credit card. ACH transactions or selling into/buying out of your Coinbase USD wallet bears a 1.49% fee.
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:27:54
Ah, cheers, bud.

Good points. Coinbase could always suffer a MTGox and then everyone using them as a wallet's shit out of luck, me included.
Though if Coinbase suffers a breach of that magnitude, we've got bigger problems on our hands since I have no real idea *how* seriously they take data protection wthe financial/PII details they have recorded.......
Bottom line, if you want to be as sure as you can that your coins are protected, if you want to isolate yourself from the risk of another MTGOX situation, absolutely follow parent's advice.

What you might be running into is a limit problem. If you go to Buy/Sell and then click "Limits," you might find that you don't qualify for Instant Buy off of your bank account yet. They probably increased the limit required and you've fallen beneath it.
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:09:23
No problem, buddy! Happy bitcoining!

The reason Bitcoin Core requires 80GB of space is because it downloads the entire *blockchain* (the historical ledger of Bitcoin transactions stretching all the way back in time) to leverage your computer to verify blockchain transactions.
As says, there are wallets available that do not download the blockchain. Alternatively, you could use [Coinbase]( they are a California-based exchange that will securely hold onto your coins. I've been a member of Coinbase for three years, and while their support may not be anything to write home about, their UI/UX is damn good.
You can link PayPal/Bank/Credit Card to your Coinbase account, enabling several different methods to move money across.
I'll go ahead and plug [my invite code]( if you join based on that link and transact $100 or more, we both receive $10 worth of BTC.

Not too hijack OP's thread too badly (it's actually sorta relevant!):
When can users expect automatic preauthorization holds to fall off of the linked card?
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:43:47


I've never used the app, so I can't tell you where to go to see it. But if you open up their desktop website and click on Accounts in the left-hand navbar, you should see "USD Wallet" sitting there underneath BTC and ETH Wallets. That is the "fiat" wallet. Fiat from "fiat currency," which is what USD is.
When you buy your coins from coinbase, how fast it takes depends on the method of purchase. Credit cards are instant, but bear a 3.99% fee. Bank ACH transfer buys/sells (or transactions into or out of the USD wallet) bear a 1.49% fee. Transferring money into or out of Coinbase's systems via the ACH network takes about 4-5 days, whether you are buying directly or depositing into the USD wallet.

I can't think of anything douchier than coming onto a reddit thread and shitposting about a guy and his kid having a good time and explaining something to a bunch of 4th graders in a way that they understand and enjoy.
