BTC transfers from Coinbase/GDAX always show up as 0 BTC fee, at least in my case. Click on view transaction and you'll see your fee there.

Roger Ver actually replied to Andreas. Andreas' tweet is from 30th of November. WTF is the point of Rogers tweet lol?

1. "What is the maximum amount of Bitcoin you should keep in a hot-wallet?" - How much are you willing to loose?
2. $100.000 vs. $50-100. Really?
3. "What amount of Bitcoin are you at a risk?". - All Bitcoin on that wallet.

Segwit's code had been available for 6 months before the Bcash fork. Their refusal to deploy Segwit proves their "high transaction fees" excuse.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:39:52
You select the sweep/scan option in your mobile wallet and than scan the private QR code on the paper wallet. GreenBits/GreenAddress, Copay, MyCelium wallets all support sweeping, not really sure about the others.
edit: You're welcome and good luck! :)

Very sorry for your loss.. Stay strong and positive everyone.

Is IOTA in trouble? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:13:16
It's safe. Ledger creates new unique address each time you receive new transaction.

Bitstamp - cheaper Bitcoin to buy and Segwit. Win - win!

You can use hard wallet with some supported mobile wallets like GreenBits, MyCelium, Electrum and CoPay (by connecting your hard wallet (Ledger Nano S or Trezor) to your smart phone via USB port).
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:26:43
As I understand guys, he's sending to Binance, an exchange, so there will be a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:36:10
You can sweep the paper wallet's private QR code using your mobile wallet and then transfer your Bitcoin wherever you like.

Andreas' reply: 
"I did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn't have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should've gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported."

Watching the weekly to confirm no reversal by Sunday.

Segwit = lower transaction fees.

You can easily increase your limits in the settings on GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:15:31
It's expected on Nov 26th.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:23:59
That's right.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:27:49
I'd just suggest keeping your paper wallet very very safe, especially from water, fire, moisture, pets :) etc.. You could keep a few copies of it at different safe locations or you could buy a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor. But other than that you got it right, congrats!

Read the Sticky FAQ.

Just like with any other mobile wallet, coins are not physically on the device. Ledger Nano S has a few Google Chrome Apps but you can also plug it directly into your smartphone and use it with supported mobile wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:30:03
I believe you can have a maximum of 4 apps installed at one time. You can safely uninstall and reinstall apps.

Withdrawals from Coinbase/GDAX have been very slow for the past few days because of their "Partially Degraded Service" as stated on the page. Just wait, your transaction should come through soon.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:41:58
It's a rental.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:31:20
This. Also, having an option to set your desired network fee is very usefull - not all wallets have this feature.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:12:29
Do you still have your seed? If you do, you might be able to restore your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:34:30
I don't think so. You have a form that you fill out, stating the reason you want to increase your limit and that's it. Also, she needs to get verified. BTW, limit on GDAX goes up to $25,000,000.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:35:23
"Not your keys, not your Bitcoin". Although Coinbase has a "wallet" I'd recommend transfering your Bitcoin to a mobile or better yet a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor where you have your private key/seed. For mobile wallets look at GreenBits, CoPay, Mycelium..
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:23:42
Trezor's Wallet, Ledger's Wallet, MyCelium, CoPay, Breadwallet, GreenBits, just to name a few..

If you sent BTC to your Ledger Nano S before you can just reuse the same address if you're worried about that.

You forgot your wallet PIN, seed or your password to encrypted data you backed up to Google Drive?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:36:41
Well he's still active, maybe he kept them to this day. ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:43:04
Just buy a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:00:55
I see.. Yeah, you would have to remember the password to the encrypted file in order to get access to your wallet from that file. Unless you've written down the 12 word (or 24) seed, that way you could easily gain access to your wallet without dealing with the encrypted backed up file.

Few safety steps for Gmail users, please feel free to add to this list:

BTC/EUR on GDAX vs. other exchanges: 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:29:19
For some reason all btc1/B2X nodes seem stuck at block height 494782 instead of 494783. (The fork was supposed to occur at 494784, so btc1/B2X nodes should have accepted block 494783 as normal.)
