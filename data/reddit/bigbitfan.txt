It was probably 'password' ;)

Who is behind blockchain.info wallets? 
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:09:47
The question is not "Is...."....but "WHY is blockchain.info becoming less reliable" ? 
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:57:21
You got that right!

Heads up: We know it's not going to be USA or Russia ;) 
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:58:15
If Russia is smart, they will fully back cryptocurrencies...as the USA continues to squeeze them hard financially and play games with them. Let's see if Putin is smart enough to figure this out. 
If Putin were to align all of his supporters &amp; economically tied nations with bitcoin / crypto, he'd regain some of his economic strength as it's outside the direct control of the USA &amp; it's allies. Esp. if China were to come onboard (China hates US economic policy as it's cost them a fortune).

What is circle. Please forgive my ignorance. I'm catching up on my reading after a health problem.

Show businesses how they can add bitcoin to their payment systems &amp; POSes. 
Hard as hell to get simple steps for this. 
This is why it was not widely adopted (yet).

LOL...I'm broke. If I had fiat to dump, I would ;)

Am I wrong in assuming I can generate new wallets with mycelium as I need/want to ? 
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:09:08
It should be an *online* book with 'real time' updates ;)   
Are you listening O'Reilly ?
I gave you the future.
Now take it.

Exactly. Coinbase and others are antithetical to bitcoin &amp; contrary to the whole idea of bitcoin NOT involving 'blind trust' of third parties. Take something beautiful like bitcoin and use it with something like a 3rd party coinbase &amp; you create a bastard child. We need to disseminate scripts that allow business users to handle all their own transactions on their own servers/sites instead. Don't take away privacy by making everyone 'register' their full identities and bank acct details so the feds can do what they When they want to you.

If Putin was SMART, he'd FULLY adopt bitcoin...along with his allies. The US is putting pressure on Russia with financial sanctions &amp; costing them a *fortune* in money &amp; oil. This is his real opportunity to fight back...and bitcoin would benefit while the US government's attempts to squash it would not! 
Putin: "The enemy of your enemy is your friend".  
Disclaimer: I don't personally support any government. However, I *do* support bitcoin.

If it's done right, fb doesn't have to know it's being done. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:29:18
But will such a market crash really help Bitcoin and why exactly? Please help folks understand. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:23:35
Yes, I am interested in this, too. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:51:14
Nobody mentioned Finland, or Germany? I wonder why. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:37:42
Very good point. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:39:14
Very VERY sad to hear that! That was ONE important feature for me, too. Can we PLEASE bring this back, Mycelium developers? 
@_date: 2014-09-14 20:16:21
I just posted about this. Let's see if Putin is as smart as they claim he is. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 06:24:23
That's very good news! Thanks. Good to hear from you Rassah. Take your time &amp; do it right. Looking forward to the updates.

Someone had access to your computer and/or phone, and/or recorded your activity via an hd cam. I proved to my boss that it could be done without installing any malware or software on his computer. After that, at his insistence, I helped him install a secret keylogger on his pc ... and low and behold the next day he found someone actually trying to guess his new pwds that he'd just created...his wife had tried to access his computer. I'm not responsible for what happened next ;)  We later installed hidden security cams in the room &amp; special software requiring more than a pw for access. No more access attempts. No longer possible to access his computer via pw alone.

Who is behind blockchain.info again?  ;) 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:53:04
Good side point. Pending feature should help protect users from losses. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:09:34
While you say 'nothing out of place', obviously you missed something...they didn't get access by magic... 
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:32:27
Thanks. Please explain how it is better than other countries (besides the beautiful countryside!) 
@_date: 2015-08-07 06:30:52
Simple. We show new business start up entrepreneurs just how unfriendly NY is .... and encourage everyone to look elsewhere. Let NY shoot itself in the foot ;) 
@_date: 2015-08-07 06:32:08
So TRUE! NY is run by true schmucks!!  ;)

Why was it banned, and is it still banned or has it been reinstated? 
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:12:24


^^ This is the correct answer.

Waaay easier to just use a gift card purchased locally with cash.
