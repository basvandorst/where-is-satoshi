10% luck 20% will 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain and a 100% reason to hodl in the crypto game

Yes that sucks
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:54:41
Great answer thanks.

Transaction fees could be below 1$ with Lightning Network and/ or 100%  Segwit usage... Fees shouldn't be anywhere close to the current price

It's not about the exchanges.. Go on and send Bitcoin from one wallet to another (not on an exchange) and see how much money you lose.. You'll be crying very soon then

This could be a good approach, however we would have to change marketing completely. We would have to be on the news to teach how Bitcoin is not a currency, but a wealth storage system. Problem is that so many people buy it because it's a currency and they won't understand the advantage it has to gold, so the average Joe would probably rather buy Gold than Bitcoin as Gold is a lot easier to understand.

Well there are so many coins out there that claim how great they are. I am invested in a few coins apart from Bitcoin, but you need to know that claiming something in a testnet is a lot different than actually having the capabilities to do that. Number 1 in transactions completed per day is by far Ethereum, however Bitcoin could be close.

There are some ways to test out Lightning Network right now right? How fast are transactions there?     
And what's the current estimate of Lightning Network being implemented (as that's my biggest problem with Bitcoin that it takes sooooo long for it to improve technical issues) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:27:13
I'm not a Roger Ver fan boy.. I did plenty of research and yes 21 Million Coins is not a lot however we advertise Bitcoin as a currency and if its supposed to be a currency fees are really important. If we advertise it as a store of value then it's not very relevant unless it gets incredibly higj

Well I always buy the dips too. However it won't continue like that for many years if we don't change our technology 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:08:48
Why do you think it won't be implemented? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:36:18
That would be nice but any real numbers? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:57:34
Sorry but I guess you don't understand what the Lightning Network is or does and what Segwit is doing. Bitcoins mining difficulties increase however with these technologies we can have fees that are a tiny fraction of the current ones (up to over 40$)
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:43:40
Ok thanks for your reply and lighting network will also result in transaction fees being extremely low right? So way below 1$?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:04
True, but Bitcoin has the potential of having fees incredibly low and the higher the fees go the bigger the risk that another coin/ technology will overtake Bitcoin... It's still very far away from this but we need to be realistic. Bitcoin will stay Top Crypto if they figure it out soon or else it will be a really rough time for all of us
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:03:47
Well that's what I'm doing but what is Bitcoin then? Just a store of value as it currently is right now? Is this all Bitcoin will be able to do in future? No way this is what we all hope for and what we want to see.    
Bitcoin needs to have really low fees so that at some point we can use it. As soon as people will use it to buy every day items it'll be so many more times worth than what it is now. Sadly this is still quite far away right now and other currencies are developing technologies that might overtake us if it remains like that
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:14:10
You think that if we don't implement Lightning Network or Segwit or any other scaling solution that we will continue to moon maybe to one million by 2020?     
With changes for sure.. Without no way
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:56:06
Thanks for your response and yes that's exactly how I feel. I don't want to be rude to anyone but right now its important to realise that we can't wait too much longer. Sure it's necessary that there are no errors before launching anything, but waiting too long will have incredibly bad results on Bitcoins future
