1) "Our" gains
2) Some of us want to leave the world a better place. Despite the many charities that mismanage their money, their are good ones out there.

And the reason that we don't have post flairs/tags is... ?
Mods? Hello?

Wow that's about the most on point argument I've seen in a while.

To be fair, most STEM graduates end up in a job with a pay ceiling and/or salaried position. Tradework gets you started half a decade earlier and proper saving/investing will make a huge difference in that time, especially since you'll be debt free. Problem is a lot of people in the trades aren't the type of save/invest well. But the guys I work with make more money per hour than I do and deserve it. They also work more hours.
Very few of my STEM colleagues make $70K+ within the first couple years, and those that do either went to Michigan for the automotive OEMs or work in Toronto and pay out the ass for living expenses. The rest of us found hourly positions at smaller companies.

So you cashed out to cover the processing cost?

Unfortunately, if you are spending thousands and thousands of dollars on a product from a relatively new company, the onus is on you to manage your expectations and understand the warranty. I'm not buying a Tesla anytime soon but I understand and support the appeal to the crowd that is willing to afford it.
Tesla continuously improves their processes slightly differently from other manufacturers in that they have ongoing improvements over time as opposed to simply correcting issues/major updates - or at least (having worked on the tools that *make* the parts for several manufacturers, that is what I have observed.

Sure it is. Run a pool miner (RIP nicehash) for a month or two and even on your last gen AMD GPU you can get worthwhile returns. .01 BTC isn't insignificant money for a few hours of setup work. When people say 'mine bitcoins' what they really mean is 'sell my power for bitcoins' - or what they *should* mean.
Ever since nicehash went down my bedroom has been cold when I get home...
You're not going to see crazy profit from it, but using various mining pools gave me free money to play around with.

80% by what reference point at what date?
Do you have a target balance? How often do you rebalance?

I 100% intended to write 'if you're not paying your own hydro' but completely forgot. So, yeah. Oops.

What happened to the other month?

Coinbase fees aren't great.
Use LTC for inter-exchange transfers, generally the cheapest.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:45
It's even funnier when you remember that the fees for that tx would be greater than the tx itself.

You're just talking about using Bitcoin as an appreciating asset.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:02:42
I would change that from "salary" to "income" - if I have a salary for 50K but make the same from other work, that's very different.

Manufacturing plant floor work? Good pay for that stuff in most places. Compensates for the fact that people like me have to design the tooling to be monkey proof.
If you don't like being a floor monkey, find another way to get paid. Or don't get paid, live the life you want to live. It so happens that the life I want to live includes having some money to spend.

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.
There are potentially 1 million owners of each 21 bitcoins.

I did it within hours of a coworker last week and I was validated within four business days. He is still waiting.

True, if it were that many years ago. I assumed a max of a few years ($200 price at low point) because if it were longer... duhhhh search for it lol

Where the fuck is 54 coming from???
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:43:30
You're asking us if it's even worth searching for what, at worst case, is about $5000, and best case is around $20,000?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:58:34


Welp, there's your answer.
Still, I'd kick myself if I turned 100% in, so I'd probably leave a third or a half for future gain.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:56:28
Far more than the lower middle class, though.

No, the people who are saying that it's in a bubble are the people who are saying that it's overpriced.

Funny how it seems to always be management that causes the issues with timelines :P
But I agree with your point.
