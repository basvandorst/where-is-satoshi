OK Thank you for confirming this and now that I know you have used it I want to ask you a few questions cause I'm new. So first, I read something about how old wallets make transactions slowly sometimes on Bitrefill in their FAQ so what do you think about the wallet called BitGo? Is it good? Also, do I have to send the exact amount of BTC Bitrefill tells me too like are there any fees that make the amount sent smaller or anything like this I'm not told?

Yeah you're right about the camera. I think I'll use Samourai. Thank you man, God bless you. Goodbye!

OK So what turns out is that it sends the whole amount I chose, and then takes the transaction fee from whats left in the wallet right?

Oh wait, one more thing, what are these buttons 1 sat/b, 3 sat/b, 6 sat/b when I want to transfer to someone?

So if I choose 1-2 Sat/b it should get there in 15 minutes and work with Bitrefill right?

Ah also, which is better, using samourai on my phone, or using electrum on my pc?

Thank you so much!

alright lemme check it out

If I need to send it in 15 minutes do I want to aim for the next block or the next next block when it comes to fees?

thank you so much it looks legit but its tested right that when i send the btc to the address it really does finish the order?
