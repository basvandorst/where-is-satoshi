It's always cool to see a gradual climb upwards.
I view Bitcoin's moon time as an inevitability on the grounds that it costs less and is more efficent than legacy payment systems.
 I hope it hovers around 230 so I can pick up more on the low.

I think your right on this. I think money is too abstract of a concept for people to really grasp. Money has really been one thing for most people their entire lives. Paper and numbers in a bank account. Now we are at a point in time where that has changed.
I think BTC is going to swallow up a lot of national currencies. Especially the weaker ones. I think we will see that in about 10-15 years.

I have no masters. I can drop out anytime and move to a different country and pay no taxes! Consult and keep every penny I make, all for myself. I wont have to share a thing of my hard work. But those countries fucking suck and I don't want to live there because the quality of life is low.
Why am I okay with being taxed more? Because I have more than I need. More money that I can spend. Why do I have this?
Because my parents had good jobs. That they got from getting an education, payed for my the government, in entirety. Which in turn allowed them to save enough money to pay my way through school. So I graduate with no debt.
You see I'm the product of good social programs. I have a good life because of the education that peoples taxes' paid for. I can spend money and support the economy. I'm not paying debt for 5-10 years. Instead, I save for my early retirement.
So why am I fine with my taxes increasing when Bernie is in charge? Because it will continue the virtuous cycle. So people can get educated for free, get great jobs building cool shit, and build a strong economy.

I agree with you. Fiat can't last. What I was getting at is the Fiat system would crash faster.
TO the best of my knowledge, the USD gets a lot of it's value from the belief that it is a strong currency. That it wont fluctuate in value. So people use it for international trade as it's the world reserve currency.
If the government default's people are going to start questioning it's legitimacy and look to hold another reserve currency. This is what I think would happen.

The way I view it is that every president will overspend the budget. If you look at history, that is what they do. It is the reality of the situation. 
Now why am I susceptible to his "pandering"? It's where he is going to spend the money.
Education. This is the ticket out of poverty and how to build a strong middle class which makes society stable. The country now has more people that can innovate to build the future, creating demand for the technology and products that are built in this country. Strengthening the economy for the long run.
Removing money out of politics. This is the greatest danger to our democracy. When extreme wealth abuses it's power and starts stacking the system so more extreme wealth can benefit itself is bad for the country.
Environment. I want a sustainable world so that future generations aren't burned with mistakes of the past.
Energy. The dude is pro solar.
Financial Regulation. The banks are out of control. 10-1 we have another disaster on our hands in a couple years from their reckless greed. Sander's will reinstate glass-stegal and limit the risks bank's take.
Minimum wage increase. This needs to happen. Minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation. This will help people escape poverty.
The reason I support these issues is that it makes the world a better place for everyone. 
I'm going to be taxed more. I'm going to see less money from my bonuses and have less disposable income to buy bullshit I don't need.
The government will overspend. But I don't care if it is an investment in things that will make the lives better for millions of people.
So I didn't have a sudden realization. Maybe you could help me out.

[Cost of solar over time.](
Clearly, lol. I'll explain how solar works. It's progress is on a evolutionary curve approaching 0. It's called zero marginal cost. Once solar is installed, and the initial investment is paid off, the energy it generates is free.
Furthermore, what will generate more power in the future. Your nuclear plants, or 100 million buildings outfitted with solar panels? It's a decentralized energy grid. Centralized structures can't compete at scale.


Do you believe men can find ways to do material science, nanotechnology, rocket science, medicine, and bio tech without public education?
We live in a society that was built by social programs. It's called the virtuous cycle. Education is paid for. So people learn cutting edge technology. Then they build cool shit. People buy it. The economy grows. That growth is taxed, put back into education and other infrastructure to help society grow.


Wealth inequality is bad for society. DO you know why? Because wealth can amass more wealth easily. What does that wealth do? It's sits in the stock market. It doesn't cycle. The problem with ultra billionaire's is not that they make so much, it's that they spend so little. Which is bad for the economy. What happens when wealth inequality gets so extreme? Like it is now and in 1920. You know what followed 1920 right?
You don't understand that extreme wealth inequality simply doesn't provide a stable society. Shit breaks down. It doesn't work.


Well you better give up and stop fighting for whats right. It's a lot easier isn't it. You lie to yourself that their is nothing you can do. Change starts from one person. It always has.

Now what position does that leave you in? Is what I did fair? It's my land. I have every right don't I?
What would you do in this situation? How would the world be if this was the ideal?

My belief is that history is repeating itself.
Large corporations see an opportunity to make a huge profit from this tech. Just like AOL and Compuserve did with TCP/IP. They will get large and hugely successful but I think(and hope) that they will give into the robustness of bitcoin. 
I think Bitcoin will ultimately lead to lower costs and faster turn around than their walled gardens. 
Also, if they build their walled gardens, people can still use Bitcoin and compete with all the services the banks offer.
Once Banks go on their blockchains, what's stopping anyone from offering the same service that they do?
But who knows. Time will tell.

Is it stealing? Or is it an obligation to contribute to the society so everyone can benefit? Paying it forward as you will.
How do you think society would function without taxes?
Wealth inequality is bad for society. Good for a few individuals, but bad for society. If you can point out a time in history where extreme wealth inequality made a society prosper.
[Quality of Life by Country](
But of course this depends on your perspective. If you are extremely wealthy you might not want to be born in a more socialist country. It all depends on ideology, which is never practical.
In my opinion, democratic socialism is the way to go. A good balance between government control and free market. These two elements must be balanced for society to thrive.
Governments, when not under regulatory capture, or influenced by special interest money), keeps our roads safe, our water clean, and our air fresh, basically stopping the assholes that would ruin the commons to make a quick buck. The free market is still available to provide people with incentives to innovate.
[And check out this social experiment.](

To clarify, I agree with your view on bit coin and why something like it would prove to be an extreme benefit for society. Our monetary policy is fucked. I'm looking forward to the day the government wont be able to go to war because they can't stealth tax through printing money.
But lets stick to the issue of benefits that governments bring and our discussion of energy.


So no advancements in this field will make this technology cheaper and more efficient. It is maxed. Do I understand your position right?


I disagree, the left's answer, if you want to get divisive, is wind, hydro, solar and geothermal. A decentralized combination.
And this is the free market deciding. Nuclear plant's can't compete economically with a decentralized energy structure.
Once the initial investment is paid off, the wind is free, the solar is free, the heat from the earth is free.
The technologies are getting cheaper and more efficient every year.
The assumption that solar will always and forever be a toy to nuclear is absolutely ludicrous. What is that based on? Where is that view even coming from? Dismissing any and future advancements in a booming technology sector?
[Check this out, this is the guy setting up the decentralized energy grid in Germany.]( Might want to skip a little bit into it.


Let's not call my opinion bullshit, my opinion is just as valid as yours.
I've repeatedly heard this viewpoint. "Taxes are slavery." "The government is robbery blah blah blah."
I view this as we need to do what is best for the individual and not what is best for the group.
Have you heard of the virtuous cycle?
It might start with an exogenous factor such as technological innovation. As people get familiar with the new technology, there could be learning curve effects and economies of scale. This could lead to reduced costs and improved production efficiencies. In a competitive market structure, this will probably result in lower average prices or a decrease in employment as it takes fewer workers to produce the same output. As prices decrease, consumption could increase and aggregate output also. Increased levels of output lead to more learning and scale effects and a new cycle starts.
So how are we,as a society , going to handle learning that technology. You do have a grasp on how advanced 2015 is right? 
Should we privatize that? How are the majority of for-profit private schools performing at the moment.


Well actually we do, we do this as as society. It's called the law. You know whats a good idea? Not murdering. If your going to do it. We point a gun at them and say, if your not going to follow our idea of not murdering we will lock you up in a cage.
Now, I'm sure your referring to taxation. Because you don't believe in public education your most likely not going to use it. You will go to a private school or more likely learn on your own.
Now because you don't use those public services you feel that it is right that you are not taxed. I can understand that view point.
But you still benefit from all the technology and economic benefits that we developed by people that went to public schools. Like GPS, you like the thing called internet? Well, taxes paid for it. What about all the tech that went into your computer that you use? How many advancements came from breakthroughs from people that went to publicly funded schools?
Society benefits when we work together. When you have people just looking out for themselves it's wont work. Someone will rise to the top and then stack the system to their sole benefit.


One last thing, first you say that it's not fair to threaten violence at someone if they "don't follow your ideas". Then you advocate that the people that you disagree with, and don't follow your ideas should be starved and shot in the street. Care to explain that? Seems a bit hypocritical.
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:03:26


This is based on the premise all governments are corrupt. I advocate balance and accountability. 
To witness corruption in government, and come to the conclusion, "Well it's corrupt and we have to get rid of it", doesn't address the root problem of what corrupted it. Is it a lack of public interest? Why has the public lost faith? Is it too much money from special interest? Why are special interests allowed to influence government policy? What checks and balances are we missing.


Again I advocate accountability.
@_date: 2015-09-11 20:14:58

I can see where your coming from. Where power attracts the corrupt. But, that would rule out the people that want to do good for others on a large scale. These people do exist. They just seemed to get drowned out by all the bad apples.

Personal attack's and assumptions won't help this debate. To clarify your fear, I'm in my 30's working for a multi-national corporation and have lived in multiple countries. Is that enough to qualify to debate you?
I agree with you that it will take time to reform tax-code. What are you basing your timeline on? Should we start to reform now, or just give up cause it's difficult?
As for the military, I didn't type, "stop funding the military". I typed, "not going to war." Their is a significant difference. We can still adequately fund the military and not send it to war so corrupt politicians can write out contracts to rebuild what we destroy. You know, sound foreign policy. Saves money and lives!
Do you ever ask yourself, why shit is hitting the fan? What is the root cause?
What could possibly be leading to an unstable society? Is their any situation that repeats through history that leads to societies destabilizing?
