You can find it on meet up. 5 bitmain antminer 180g. You never answered my question because you are a spineless retard, Corky. Got ANYTHING positive to invest in this community?  And each antminer runs at 300w but each of my two run at 500w. My fridge is 600w. My studio computer that I record music on averages about 1000w when I'm working. My point is it's not that expensive and it by far underweighs the profits I have been able to make. Forget Corky, he is the equivalent of someone who hates Kanye West yet spends all day on kanye's website hating on him. The type to stalk and kill a celebrity they "love" or "hate". Like Selena. Look at Corky's posts. All he does is come in and be negative on people's positive posts. This is what we call a professional troll. Someone who is obsessive about hating on other people's happiness. A worm. A troll. A retard. That's why I call him corky!!  He's my pal!

i just am sick of it.  same with goddamn obama praise and bush praise and all that stuff.  banks and media are totally scared of a currency they can't control.

How in any way is it stupid to compare the first completely true peer to peer monetary system to these revolutionary things?  Are u a bubble believer?  It will absolutely go mainstream. It is currently going mainstream. In 2000 sony had a board meeting over digital music and it said that it was too complicated and no one would ever listen to music on their computer or be able to understand and embrace the download process for it go mainstream. You sound like them. When the internet began creeping into the hacker sphere people said that normal people would never embrace it. It was too complicated and most homes didn't have a computer. Comparing bitcoin to WebTV is like comparing the internet to the sony Walkman. You sound retarded.

Oh good. Troll then report, Corky. Really showed me!
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:05:42
I apologize. Can u please move somewhere else I'm trying to have a discussion about music and bitcoin. I disagree with your views 100 percent and enjoy being a grade schooler. Thank you

And "crashing into oblivion" meaning 750$ to the dollar. 
And being "accepted" by major retailers who see a 50% overall increase in sales
And I personally have been able to feed my family on the profit I've made by investing in them.  
Keep it retarded brother. What's your WebTV user name?  I'm on Prodigy. Message me

I keep up voting you because I think you rule. This is fun 
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:40:46
No you are a tool who provides nothing but negativity. Admit it. You came her to bash bitcoin enthusiasts. You are pathetic. I tend to hang out with people who I like and who like me. But obviously you have nothing positive to put into the conversation. And you clearly don't have a circle or friends of your own, so you come here to find self importance in butchering otherwise positive conversations. Are you married? Def not. Do you have any long term meaningful relationships? Probably nothing beyond surface. Do you have anything positive to add to a conversation with Bitcoin?  Nope. Just a troll who likes to come in and ruin a good time. Good for you tulip girl. "Irl" you couldn't handle me in real life. Even after you took off your leg braces and used them as a weapon I would still out smart you, Corky

I guarantee for every death in bitcoin universe there are 50 banker death/murders/they don't report it in the media because they are all in at the big media/bank/politics meetings.  the recent nymag article is proof of this fallacy.  look at the same writer's article in 4/13 saying that BTC was gonna crash.  it's sad, but it's so awesome to watch because we all know they can't stop something decentralized.  they tried to stop the inet, they tried to stop napster, they try to stop the people from being in control, but guess what.  game over.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:13:27
I spend mine all the time. It's how we keep bitcoin community strong 
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:41:52
Ah your last statement proves your misunderstanding of bitcoin. The dollar also works the same regardless of it's value with the euro. But they have banks who inflate and deflate the price. Bitcoin is organic and it's value is established by the community's activities. Your new name is Corky 
As for amazon. Another uneducated statement. Want to see the overstock.com articles about how it had a large sales bump once bitcoin was implemented?  50 percent. Google it Corky. That's 
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:59:45
Oh here's this prick again. Only here to bash BTC. tulip do u own any?  Have u actually seen a miner or the bill?  I have 5 that run silent and use far less electricity than my fridge. You don't know what your talking about and sound like a retard. Thanks corky for the entertainment
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:11:58
super smart, and soulful
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:29:47
Hey retard. Why are u even posting here if this is how you view bitcoin?  Pissed that u didn't buy any early on?  Or maybe just like to troll people who support things. Get out of here 
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:52:41
Nice. You can't respond to the truth. Get out of here troll spammer. Made an account a day ago just to tear down bitcoin. Tulip girl. Get out of here corky. We don't want u around you loser. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:38:27
Awesome let's scissor. Yes the truth hurts that you are retarded. Any no nothing that u said is even close to the truth. U come across as educated on bitcoin as my dead grandmother. Who incidentally started the tulip bubble. And then my mom was the first to buy beanie babies. You numbskull. You're like the matthew mcconaughey of reddit. Whereas I am Skeletor 
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:30:28
Hey. How many bitcoin do you own?
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:42:22
Who is the rest of us?  I don't see any friends coming to your side here. Your user name says it all. Get lost corky. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:50:16
No they didn't 
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:42:50
Me too
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:11:48
fuck that guy is smart
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:07:03
Oh please tulip girl. Wanna drag this out?  Where do u live?  I travel a lot we can have this discussion in person 
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:28:39
I am just having fun. I love bitcoin

Following the bitcoin reddit just to post negativity and tear down positivity -- especially with such an anti-bitcoin username -- is trolling. "I hate beiber" who lives on justin beibers Facebook and website. You are a troll corky and we all love and laugh at you!!  Corky !!  Corky is such a silly little guy!!
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:14:44
I def don't have anything figured out. I'm just calling a spade a spade. Everyone posts all day long about fear of bitcoin being killed and the reality is bitcoin is like a bacteria. It's already been launched. It's not going away. And ultimately any establishment that doesn't embrace it will go down. Just like the internet. And personal computers. And digital movies and music 
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:49:37
This is from the same guy who is personally invested in banks succeeding and funding wars. This is exactly the response I would hope for out of him. Proves bitcoin is here to stay 
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:43:32
Right on Corky. There's a new thing called google. Everything on it is true 
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:56:58
I only b cocky cuz I also wrote it on a sheet of paper. I even thought of a more obscure way though. Only recording the keys and codes on a hand recorder or in my certain case a tascam 4 track porta studio.  I love how brilliant bitcoin is. It's like THE MUSIC OF MONEY. I can make art out of my cold storage. I am a musician. How amazing would it be. How Philip k dick would it be. I encrypted my wallet. My money in a song. A song I sang and passed on as a secret to my grandchildren.
