The added risk to this sort of disorganization is when a nefarious character decides to frame the owner/custodian of these coins by sending documented and known to be "dirty" Bitcoin to one of these wallets.  Then all a governing authority has to do is go to any one of these exchanges w/ a Court Order demanding they reveal who the account holder is and they'll righteously be able to hide behind their cause and there won't be any practical way for the account holder to (anonymously) defend themselves.  
BOOM.  Whoever the custodian(s) of these coins is/are, you just blasted every satoshi on the front page of every Authority that has a half-brain's homepage. 
This is the epitome of "tipping your hat" to the good and bad players.  Let it be a lesson to everyone that didn't have the common sense one ought to have when playing with a gun of this caliber...

It's def. exclusive to GDAX.  It's only showing what I have in my GDAX account.  Does not add what's in my Coinbase account - (I have some in both).   Hopefully they streamline this and we're simply experiencing the beta-phase.

I already wrote off my assets here when BTC-E went down for good...  THEN when BTC-E re-launched under the [Wex.nz]( alias, I liquidated the crypto the reimbursed me with and have been arb'ing the tokens awarded ever since.  This is and always has been the WWW (Wild-Wild-West).  **Don't store on** **ANY** **exchanges what you can't afford to lose!**  I thought it was strange when I noticed my limit sell orders for most all the tokens I had on here sold in the beginning of this month @ near 1/1 ratio's.  Luckily, I didn't submit any buy-back orders (for their "tokens") until today.  After logging in just now and seeing the token prices take a bath today, I did some scanning and found what's being communicated in here.  As I said earlier - I've already written off everything on this exchange once and was elated to discover I got a huge chunk of it back...  
They didn't have to do that.  The admins could have easily ran off with everyone's assets and acted like the douche-canoe's they were being accused of (Mt. Gox launderers, etc...).
Maybe it was all (BTC-E 2.0/ Wex) was an elaborate ploy in an attempt to regain as much trust as possible and compel users to deposit more assets only to later run off w/ our hard-earned crypto, maybe they're as honorable as they put off and simply fell subject to some other attack  (be in governmental or other) and they're now just trying to mitigate the damage.  One thing's for sure; if this is the result of a scam and they're about to run off w/ everyone's assets, it's a first of its kind.  Maybe I'm naive but, I just don't see that being the case.
For me - I'm going to maintain buy/sell orders for their tokens and keep my fingers crossed this is some minor 'speed-bump' the site owners/admins are working to overcome.  Best of luck to all of us holding a bag on there.  For any Wex owners/admins reading this and other critical threads, don't think we all have doubt in you.  Some of us genuinely do appreciate the level of honor and integrity you've afforded us through these storms.  You could have easily gone dark w/ the crypto that wasn't confiscated and bought an island or small country with our assets.  Even if this is the beginning of the end of BTC-E/Wex.nz, I appreciate your allowing us to pull out what was left when we could &amp; FWIW, your whole "token" concept was something to be admired by many - myself included.  
For everyone else that lost and can't/won't forgive this entity, tough-shit.  This wasn't the first, and it certainly won't be the last time crypto-platforms (scandalously) participate in or are subject to foul-play.  **Nothing is safe in this space - PERIOD.**  Quantum computing is real and now.  It's only a matter of time before IBM, Google, AT&amp;T, Booz Allen, NASA or even perhaps the NSA/CIA successfully deploy a QC on the BTC &amp;/or any/every other crypto-algo in existence and thwarts their respective blockchain.  Perhaps if/when that happens, you'll blame the owner/operator of the QC for crashing select/all markets then too?  Don't be ignorant and don't play a game you can't afford to lose.  Put in what you can afford to never see again.  Ride the waves and don't get greedy.
Godspeed to all of us.
