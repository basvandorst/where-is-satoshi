Probably invest it in something safer. I'm not a thrill seeker when it comes to finances. Something with an obvious upwards or steady trend is feeling safer than this roller coaster. Yes rollercoasters are fun, but at some point, you're tired and you wanna go home.

Hi yes this is my thread and I'm not imposing my opinion on you at all so... Ok. Enjoy your rollercoaster ride. I'm asking someone to give me real reasons why I should stay on cause I do want to stay. But thanks for your super helpful comment.

Now this is the answer I was looking for! These are great points and I appreciate it so much. Thank you. There is hope and you're pointing out why

That's exactly right. I'm so concerned with "why am I even holding this? There's no discernable value in my mind" but I'm still holding. Through the whole year. But I'm worried about it just dropping off the map. And yet... I'm considering buying more. What's wrong with me? I have a feeling tomorrow is gonna either break the back of coins or it will launch something big. What's your opinion?

Because I'd rather retain 40% if it's just going to keep dropping. I've held on through the whole year. Don't even think I'm a pussy. But the general feeling was that it shouldn't drop below 6000. What is to say it can't drop farther?

That's the core of what I'm asking. What is the technology? "Decentralization"? Why is it superior to PayPal for instance?
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:06:14
That's exactly what I had forgotten. It is what I needed to hear you know? I mean, as long as there is a strong value, which another user posted, there will be money to be made. I lost my concern with all you guys talking it over with me and I think I'm gonna keep holding and possibly even pick up a bit more when it reaches lower in 2019. Hopefully we will not see it go much lower but if it does I'm ready and I'll look back at this comment to remind me of why I invested in the first place. Thank you so much for your well written and helpful comment and I wish you best of luck during the future!!!

Thank you man, I'll research it. I caught the fever without knowing what I was really getting into. Seeing my money grow from 16k to 20k absolutely blew my mind. Then watching it go from 16k to 5k hurt badly. 
I'll be sure to read what you gave me. Thanks!!

Actually my lifestyle hasn't changed but seeing my money just disappear hurts me

Yes this does help absolutely. And yet, there's something in the back of my mind that calls BS when someone says the government can't control btc. They absolutely can if they want. Can't they? To my mind, wouldn't it just be a matter of bringing some of their supercomputers online as a btc mine? Or just criminalize it entirely, through that feels far-fetched. I feel if the government wanted, they could control it. 
I do like the safety of btc but I don't feel it's necessarily any safer then our Rock solid software we already have that's available and used so widely. Hope that makes sense. Not trying to be contrary

I own a fair chunk of crypto. Why? Because I'm a sheep going along with the pack. I'm thinking for myself now. I understand that markets have ups and downs and I've been in this for a year now. I've seen my investment drop 60%. I need to know when to call it and just dump. Can anyone give me a plausible reason to stay in? Not just HODL IF YOU CARE!!! No.  There needs to be a reason. I want to believe in this. But I'm losing so much money. What are valid reasons this can turn around? Why is Bitcoin so valuable that it'll reach 100,000 as one poster said? I'd just be happy if it came back up to 10,000. Thanks.
