Looks like [Doriancoin]( has been launched :D
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:47:38
just a thought - if Dorian accepts the donation, imo it makes him less likely to be THE Satoshi, while if he rejects it, it makes him slightly more likely imo to be our Satoshi

The infamous tank man can be seen in videos being hastened away by undercover chinese authorities shortly after the famous photo was taken. 
He has never been seen or heard from again.

you can buy older antminer asics on ebay for example that are pretty worthless for mining bitcoin directly but might be profitable mining alts, depending on how much you pay for the device

no way you are mining bitcoin directly with a personal computer and earning that much.
do you mean you are mining on Nicehash? might earn that much with a 1080ti, but understand you aren't mining bitcoin with nicehash.  you are selling your hashing power to the highest bidder and getting paid for it in bitcoin, and they are using your hashing power to mine altcoins

it is a store of value, backed by electricity costs to mine it

I don't know, I'm not a security expert.  I just hear rumors lately about a fatal flaw in segwit going to be announced next year, and I'm trying to figure out what would happen if that were actually true
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:27:18
Interesting.  I mean if you take it to the extreme, it clearly is - reduce blocksize so only 1 transaction can fit per block.  Or zero.   You think that won't slow adoption?   I guess if everyone can get just 1 tx into a block to load their lightning channel, they'll never need to transact Bitcoin again

why would you buy a meal with BTC? It is a store of value, not a peer to peer electronic cash system.  Do you also buy meals with gold bricks? the restaurant is just dumping BTC for fiat... dont support scammers like this
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:19:42
how exactly would that work - removing segwit?  seems like it would require a rollback of the blockchain to 2017, wiping out billions of dollars worth of economic activity?
@_date: 2018-12-09 00:29:49
we should reduce the blocksize to 1kilobyte.  it's more decentralized that way.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:31:41
so... a fatal security flaw is announced to segwit.  What happens next? and what of all the bitcoins stored in segwit addresses?
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:33:24
BTC is not peer to peer cash, it is a cold storage hodling system
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:33:30
i think BTC supporters would rather just spout "muh faketoshi" and ignore the threat. lets see if that pays off
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:23:55
its clearly on the roadmap. ask or ya know just look at the OP image

lol not this smallblocker idiot

why would you buy drinks with bitcoin?  It is a store of value, not a currency.  Do you also buy drinks with gold bricks?
@_date: 2018-12-09 00:28:44


what if your goal was to slow Bitcoin's growth and adoption? would this be a valid strategy?
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:05:42
BTC is not peer to peer cash, it is digital gold.  It was meant to be hodled not spent.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:26:54
yes it is a complicated change to the bitcoin protocol implemented in 2017 that removes the chain of digital signatures from the blocks in an attempt to increase transaction throughput without hard forking
