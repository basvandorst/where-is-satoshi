So every post not hyping BTC is part of a conspiracy by short traders? This post isn't even negative on BTC.

I got a 6174-A too. For the only year I had gains, I reported the net, but didn't list every transaction.
I am now having to go through and fill in all that data (so it doesn't look like my excessive trade volume and bank transfers are undisclosed income).
It is a huge pain because I have thousands of small transactions.
Wish I never got involved in crypto trading tbh. Huge liability. Or at least wish I hadn't been day trading like a crazy person.
These ppl on Reddit advising not to report or pay taxes must have nothing to lose, are trolls, or have a much higher risk tolerance than me. You can't put a price on peace of mind. Just pay.

How I wish I hadn't traded crypto with such OCD insanity (day trading). Definitely I am way over the trade count threshold. It wasn't profitable and sure caused an accounting nightmare. Oh well.

They aren't shills, they just create click-bait like every other "news" site. And nothing more clicky than FUD.

Because you paid 0 for them?
So long as you don't sell "every shitcoin", you shouldn't have to worry with claiming them. 
I don't understand how you don't have a cost basis of 0 though. I was asking because I am confused how there wouldn't be.

My goodness that is a long, dramatic story. Glad lit has a happy ending!

Oh ok, I see. Seems like the cost of labor and other expenses would be a separate item you could deduct from capital gains. I don't see stock traders counting trading fees and labor as part of the cost basis. But what do I know, not much :).
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:49:46
I think/hope having to assume a cost basis of 0 is a rare circumstance. Even if records are missing on imprecise, the totality of transactions should provide some reasonable estimate (skewing to favor the IRS for safety) that one could rely on.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:28:49
You may be right on further research. It gets complicated. I would expect for them to eventually decide to treat them with a cost basis of 0, but for now, who knows.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:50:53
Don't forked coins have a cost basis of 0 if you are getting them free from pre-fork holdings? e.g. If from 1 BTC you got 1 free BCH, that BCH has a cost basis of 0, right?

Yeah if the Bitcoin Network were a startup, this chart would have projections!

No. Or not that I ever saw.

They are priced in BTCs, so when BTC goes down, so do all the others in USD value - unless they specifically gain/lose against the BTC.

I found that site useful. You are still at the mercy of your own records though. But it has been helpful.

The state of modern "journalism"... Bunch of maladjusted people doped on Adderall creating click bait.

There is no specific penalty for being a "day trader", though by definition all your capital gains would be short-term rather than long-term, thus taxed at the same rate as regular income.
I also received a 6174A. I did have a Coinbase account back in the day. I have endeavored to pay any taxes owed, listing crypto on tax returns.
The accounting can get tricky, especially for swaps of crypto, multiple wallets, and most especially if you don't have good records. Fully accounting for every transaction can be a painful experience.
My advice to those struggling with poor records is to estimate in the favor of the IRS, paying more than you probably owe. There is no other way to have peace of mind.
Accountants are generally useless to help with this. You have to furnish them with all the data, which is the hardest part. I personally found cryptotrader.tax pretty useful at reconciling transaction data, though again you are at the mercy of your own records.

Looks legit. Never heard a case of "pastors" pushing dubious wealth building "investments" onto trusting congregations. /s

Not news. The schedule is well known. No surprise. Not like it suddenly happened. Doesn't change anything. Click-bait for the uninformed.

You should spend your time investing in yourself, skills, career, and family. These are things you can actually bank on. Maybe you get lucky with investing, but it sure isn't anything to count on.

Be sure to document this as a sell of BTC for tax reporting. That is a big reason giving BTC as gifts or buying stuff with BTC is a PITA

Wow! That is an impressive, insightful analysis. And it rings so true. Where did you get such perspective?
