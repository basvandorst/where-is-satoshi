I... I've never been tipped any coins.

I disagree. The primary reward for miners is that the bitcoin network stays operational. Intrinsic things do not need incentive other than themselves. This is the definition of intrinsic.
Bitcoin as a currency is not much different from USD. It is supported by proof of work (you go to work, you get paid; you mine a block, you get paid). Neither have intrinsic value, they are just evidence that something occurred.

If you want to make less than a dollar per day. Don't do it if you have to buy any hardware. Use what you have, otherwise you won't see profit for a long time.

Now you're just being coy. Are you going to answer my question?

What a shitty CEO.

Actually, you can [inject images into Qr codes]( Some clever programming could grab the old Qr code, extract the image, and generate a new Qr code.
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:22:17
That is a ridiculous comparison. Many dictionaries and financial texts include the "money without intrinsic value" definition.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:39:43
Woohoo! Thanks!

This doesn't even make any sense. Also, I'm an atheist so don't flatter yourself thinking your better than the rest of us.

No, your computer will be back to normal when you turn off the mining program. Keep in mind that mining may reduce the life of your computer (mainly the graphics card), especially if it gets too hot.
Since your electricity is free, go for it. You may want to consider other coins instead (litecoin, dogecoin, etc.) as they are more profitable right now.
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:00:20
We could add another device to the equation. The merchant could send a copy of the bitcoin address to your mobile device, which you could compare via the string or a Qr code. No solution is going to work in 100% of cases 100% of the time, but I think this would catch a large majority of them.

Can I have a source for this, please?

This made me laugh harder than it should have.
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:58:45
I'm glad this is being worked on. It looks very well thought out. I wonder how close it is to a usable release.
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:23:46
I would be tempted to write "exchanged for goods" but I have no idea if you can do that. IANAL.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:22:29
Well, back to the drawing board.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:57:47
Interesting. I don't mind having bitcoins tied to my banking identity, but I'll keep this in mind. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:27:42


I agree. I also see why one would not want to explicitly call bitcoin "fiat."
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:12:28
You would need to have a near majority of the nodes in the network to even begin *guessing* at which IP a message generated from.
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:46:00
Unless your electricity is free, you will be losing money while mining. It is not profitable on your hardware.
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:34:32


I read the whole thing, and I feel your pain. Something similar happened to me. I just wanted to say that  is great for sending faxes without a fax machine, and a small number of pages is completely free. Maybe this will help you out next time this kind of thing happens.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:17:15
You have the right idea, but your numbers are way off. You need a LOT more nodes (at least an order of magnitude higher) to have a good guess at any particular IP being the originator of a message.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:17:41


Yes, but it will greatly slow down your computer. I'm hoping you mean to use your *home* computer while you're at work, rather than your *work* computer while you use it.


Absolutely not, otherwise we'd all quit our jobs. 1 bitcoin is currently worth about $830. You are looking at something more along the lines of 0.03537 bitcoins per month (if using modest GPU hardware). Don't think about mining with a CPU. You need a (preferably ATI) graphics card. High end hardware can get you more, but it will cost you a lot in startup costs.
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:00:51
Why does this sound like a bad idea?
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:54:39
If I didn't get, you didn't provide it.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:30:31
Even then it's a *maybe*. Sure they'd have more information if the seller gave the buyer his bank account information (asking the seller to put the money directly into his account), but that would be silly. A likely scenario is using an escrow service, which wouldn't really give them any information at all. Sure, they could subpoena the escrow service, but they could do that anyway; they don't have to purchase the coin. 
What information do you think they would get?
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:08:43
I never said it would give the IP. And I don't doubt that the NSA could gather some amount of valuable data by inspecting the blockchain. They certainly won't have a clear view of what's happening, but by linking together information from other sources (publicly displayed wallet addresses, for example), they could probably do some effective digging.
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:42:28
This is a scam. This user has no other posts, and the prices are ridiculously low.
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:49:24
If you think I'm a troll then you are reading too much into my question. It's not like it really *matters* what we call it.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:49:31
It's not like selling bitcoins is a new thing. There are plenty of services that escrow and hide identity, and this is the preferred way to do it. It would be different if the FBI was going to sell/buy drugs or something like that because there would also be a physical good exchanged. I'm not sure why you're acting like non-anonymity is a realistic common case.
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:23:13
I suppose it depends on who is defining "fiat."
I can understand why the government issued definition might be more appropriate, given the etymology.
Edit: a word
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:07:42
What a dick. I'm not keen on the specifics of "is a GUI inherently copyrighted?" It's one thing to clone the functionality of an app, but to literally copy the design verbatim should be illegal, at least, I hope it is.

What did they not help you with?
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:25:17
Took me 1 try. You probably need to have some kind of credit history in order to answer those identification questions correctly. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:03:40
This is an interesting idea, and I think I've read about it here before (perhaps another one of your posts).
I wonder how we would solve things like stock splitting? Also, security implementation would have to take a *huge* leap forward. Imagine someone stealing your online wallet, but instead of money (which may be replaced by insurance), they steal majority stock in a company. What then? This is both frightening and exciting at the same time.

It would be exactly the same as bitcoin, but easier for people to spend in some contexts. If it is backed 1:1 by bitcoin, what's the difference? I realize that it could be counterfeited, but I don't think that's what you are referring to.

@_date: 2014-04-17 20:38:32
You're right. I should have said "a wallet" rather than "someone."
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:15:57
It's still some random dude. If you are just buying a coin then the seller isn't giving away much information. You would have to have a good guess already as to the actual person the coin belonged to for that to matter.
Also, any bitcoin criminal should be smart enough to have several "middle man" wallets. All you need to do in order to "clean" a coin is send it through a few addresses (all owned by you, but no one else knows).
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:00:05
No. That's not how it works. Anyone can get a copy of the blockchain and look at the origin and transfer of any coin. Hell, you don't even need to download the blockchain, just use 
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:26:31
I clearly need to read more about this stuff. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:22:06


So what happens when I try to sell? I have a coinbase account with "instant buy."
Edit: The "loss" is the plummet in bitcoin value.

I must have missed something. How is Amazon related to Coinye West?
Also, Coinye West (last I heard) changed its name to just "Coinye", and now, rather than being based on Kanye West, is based on a "half man, half fish hybrid."

You don't need to own a coin to see who spent it. It's all in the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:25:07
These qualities are of the bitcoin network, not a bitcoin itself. The ability to use paper money has intrinsic value in a sense, but the paper money itself does not.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:14:25
There is no information a miner has that isn't contained in the blockchain, unless you count unaccepted blocks/transactions, but those aren't really useful.
If you think there's something else, please tell us, oh wise one. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:04:49
What if the bitcoin network rejected further transactions from someone who has double spent?
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:39:44
All you can say at that point is "this message might have come from this node," assuming that you saw it from that node first. This gets further complex when you consider that any of the 100K nodes you talk to can also talk to each other, so if node  sends node  AND you the same message, it's possible that node  could relay the message to you before you receive it from node 
I am also not sure that the 1000 "neighbor nodes" number is correct. It could be as low as 100-200 (which, IIRC, are common numbers for other P2P networks).
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:23:37
Because of charge backs? Or is there something else I should be aware of?
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:21:03
If we *replace* cash completely, we have to compete with it directly. If we accept Bitcoin alongside cash, it makes things easier. Especially since you could get into some legal trouble by not accepting federal bank notes as "legal tender for all debts public and private," as is printed on each bill.
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:18:43
Currently, I would consider it a commodity to be traded. The government might disagree.
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:54:48
I agree, this is a very cool idea. I'm very excited to see how bitcoin will affect our everyday lives in the next few years.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:14:27
But what if no one wants to buy your coins? I understand buying will almost certainly be happening, but what if sells &gt; buys? Wouldn't the exchange have to take the loss? 
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:14:01
And which of overstock's suppliers takes bitcoin? How about the employees? Would you like your wages paid in volatile currency?
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:50:58
Perhaps a loophole that doesn't consider bitcoin a currency, but a commodity?
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:57:18
Absolutely not. If you think it does, explain it to me.
