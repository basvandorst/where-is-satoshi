Just to be clear. The price will not automatically rise just because there is more demand. A seller would have to raise the price. As the seller does that more sellers will follow (at least that is how it's supposed to work) and the price goes up. The block chain doesn't sell anything and has no control over price. Only the people selling have control over the price. If no one wants to sell at a certain price it will never happen. Also a buyer can put in a buy order for as many bitcoins as they want (even more than can ever exist) as long as they have enough of what ever currency they are trading with. But of course if they did try to buy more Bitcoin than can ever be created, then that order would never be completely filled. This is generally how most exchanges work around the world.

I never said if I lost or made money ;P I actually managed to score with the $1200. It's all about holding. That's all I've done with Bitcoin except in that last sentence and it's worked so far.

I agree. Infact that's the reason why I had the opertunity to make money when it hit 1200. I would have never had that opertunity if I hadn't bought Bitcoin to buy something else and keeping the change stored instead of selling.

Doesn't this usually make bigger news? I can't find any other sites saying this

Thought we already answered this question to you..
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:58:55
If you want a nice financial future invest in companies that pay dividends. But having said that, being at a young age it's ok to take risky investments just don't throw it all in to Bitcoin just yet.

Lol, knew someone was gonna post this... It's all part of the game and it happens everytime...
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:01:58
Yeah if you read the Bloomberg one it says the market is speculating China needs a 1 time devaluation...this 1% drop thing isn't as scary as the other guy makes it sound.. Would be nice if bitcoin reacts that way though ;P
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:50:01
At least you got a tip. I never got any back in 2013
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:32:21
all of the above
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:22:20
I actually did.

You can't time currency... But somthing tells me you should wait until after the Brexit results are in... But don't wait long after otherwise you might miss a strong rise(if they leave)

Check out btcpop.co there's a pool you can invest your money into that lends out to only highly verified people. Also you can withdraw whenever. The payments arnt super high but it's better than sitting in your wallet doing nothing.

The way it's supposed to work is that if fiat currency devalues then Bitcoin goes up.. Kinda like gold. So no the Brexit will not make Bitcoin go down in value.

Sell them to me I'll buy them !

Well I may have worded it slightly wrong there. What I mean was that the block chain can't just say "hey this is my value". Although it does add some data to back up ones valuation. But basically yeah at this point there is enough volume(amount trading every day) that you really shouldn't have to care unless like I said you were rich enough to be able to buy every single Bitcoin that can ever exist and even wanted to. Also right now as you've probably heard the price isn't based so much on how many bitcoins there are already but rather how hard it is to mine fresh ones... After all when we get to that final day (if it makes it) of the last fresh Bitcoin...Then people will be wishing they held onto their Bitcoin at these prices

But I've used Coinbase before and they're pretty good. Playing on their exchange is easy and fun to do sometimes also.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:43:32
Yeah I thought somthing wasn't right about this article :P thanks for clearing that up a bit
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:46:08
That's exactly what he is saying yes. Don't believe all the hype.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:53:36
Finally a group of people that agree with me!
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:58:16
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:16:21
I completely agree with this. I don't understand why people think there's going to be a price jump... Long time miners have seen this coming for literally years. I believe the last few months were the pricing in. To be honest I'd like to see a stable price like true currency.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:44:51
Lol can't wait to read the disappointment post about how it only moved like 50$
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:58:41
I like!
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:42:30
You should set a remind me bot up so we can all see how right you'll be?
