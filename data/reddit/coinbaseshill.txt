You're full of shit, you don't know shit.  Your story doesn't make sense to begin with.  Coinbase would have closed your account the moment they realized you were using them to fund an account on a DNM.  So that right there does not check out.  They wouldn't report you to the police and keep your account open so that you could use it for more of what they reported you for.  Not that Coinbase reports anyone to law enforcement to begin with.
  
Let's say for a moment that the cops really did show up.  The most likely explanation would be that the DNM is a honey pot and the cops saw that the input came from coinbase and then they subpoena coinbase for your information.  This is the most likely if your story is even real.  I suspect it is not real because why would they even follow up if you really didn't buy anything?
  
The most likely explanation for this whole thing is that you made it up.

Like you said, you have been using them for quite some time.  Now, go use BitPay in the same way for the same period of time and watch what happens.

He has not done a *great job*.  He hasn't adequately explained how they were rude except to say that they took a long time to respond and didn't answer questions that they already indicated they could not answer.  This plus his unfair comparison of BitPay versus Coinbase just makes him look like a BitPay shill, but he's probably just a guy with poor communication skills.  I guarantee you that he will have the same exact experience with BitPay when it comes time to explain his transactions.

I'm not a paid shill, I'm a person who likes facts and information in order to arrive at my opinions and whenever I try to get it from threads like yours, I am accused of being one, thus the name.
  
You have vented but you haven't shared your story effectively or in a way that lends to people like me believing it.

So you had no issues getting set up..  Alright then, how about you demonstrate for us how they were rude to you.  This should be easy since you couldn't talk on the phone and you will have a nice paper trail in your email.

Tell us about your horror stories getting set up with Coinbase merchant services if you want to draw a fair comparison.  You are not drawing a fair comparison by comparing your BitPay setup time with your Coinbase compliance issues.

Why should we believe what you're saying if you won't show us evidence?  You're basically asking the community to judge coinbase without providing enough information with which to arrive at a proper judgement.

I'm confused, coinbase closed your account or you did?

The other option is that they will deposit two small amounts into your account and then you confirm those amounts.  This takes longer since you have to wait for the funds to hit your account before you can verify the amounts.

I would ask them to elaborate on what they are asking you to elaborate on.  The sentence "It appears you are associated to a number of websites outlining possible sales of marijuana." is too ambiguous.
  
Your complaints about instant purchases and limits are without merit because they are very clear about whether you are verified for instant purchases and what your limits are.  In addition they make it very clear at the time of purchase when your coins should arrive and you can choose to not make the purchase if you're not happy with the date provided.  Also, your complaint about giving them your bank account info is very misleading because you have multiple options for verification yet you chose the most invasive likely because it is the quickest.  You appear to be impatient.
