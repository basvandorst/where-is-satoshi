A current and clear mention of integration on a Paypal domain page that's been around for quite some time.
It's different than what OPs post is talking about, but the collaboration between the two entities has been worked on behind the scenes for a good while now.

Interesting. Shows up just fine for me. Maybe it's cached. Meh, either way... it's no ground breaking story. :P I don't really think I could care less what Paypal decides to do with BTC. Here's a screenshot of the page though...  Sorry about the second screen being captured.

The site says "...registration information can be found on the Singapore government website..." yet doesn't link to the page. Somewhat humorously, the Gov.SG site's search bar isn't functioning correctly, and the menu system is a nightmare. Why not just link directly to the site that lists your registration information?
**edit** Site updated to include this link... Nice. :)

In the past when people have asked about this, there was a response along the lines of having your wallet backed up somewhere else and sending from that with the fee and the chain would take that one instead. I don't know the details on that - maybe someone will see and respond better for you. I just know to always send a fee unless I don't mind waiting.

Your first weeks with Circle only allow $100 a week. Well, mine did anyway - I don't even have the option to do more. Are you sure there is $250 gone from the source?
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:12:21
What he's saying is this...
Sending your money from one bank account to another for you $50.
Sending BTC from wallet to another... next to nothing.
The problem is you trying to convert to fiat. It is NOT more expensive to send BTC. You are just trying to take it out of the ecosystem into fiat - which of course costs you. Good ol' fiat, right!
Bitstamp does NOT charge you 1% to exchange BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:49:33
One of the bigger problems with the way people view BTC is that too many are trying to see it as an investment - some way for them to make money - instead of actually helping the bitcoin community by purchasing with them, and rebuying what they've spent. Sure, hold on to some I suppose - I have a couple in holding, but it's getting kind of old to me hearing about people just using them as an investment product instead of a currency... which is its main point.

If the biggest exchange is closed, how can people sell coin they have there - hence lowering the price? So yes, 0% fees on an OPEN exchange will have more effect, although it may or may not have jack to do with this. The dam and FUD are a little more accurate.

So here goes... Satoshi is making spaghetti with his cat Schrodinger. Unfortunately, ever time he looks away - the spaghetti is no longer there! No matter what Satoshi looks at, everything else around him disappears unless he observes it directly - meaning only one thing can be in confirmed existence at any moment! From that day forward, Satoshi only looked at Bitcoin so that all others may experience its awesomeness. The End. Yeah, I failed my creative writing class.

You had 27 BTC in a wallet with no cold storage backup... no paper wallet... everything sitting on an internet connected computer? I really do feel sorry for you man, but you treated it like it wasn't important by taking zero security measures. Here's hoping your next BTC experience is better.
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:57:09
I buy when I have extra money to spare, which isn't often. I can't predict that I'll have money to spend on BTC then. I'm not a big trader or investor, I just find it interesting. I think my first small purchase WAS at 450 actually. I don't recall saying I bought at 300, but I prolly got $20-30 or something then too.
I see you're looking at it from an investment standpoint. I'm buying, spending, and rebuying to spend and so forth. Forwarding the BTC economy. If I don't buy now, how can I have any BTC to support businesses that accept it?!!?!?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:02:34
Man, You have GOT to do away multi-day exchanges. Too many instant options out there.
*edit* Just read the DNM comment - so I'm guessing you didn't research much before you went in, just found the first way to get BTC. YOu can get your shit way quicker than you are!
*edit 2* Also, If you're only using for the DNM's, don't buy until you're spending.

Whales and day traders treating it solely as a profitable commodity keep the price all messed up. Sadly 95% of people involved with BTC, especially the people in this sub, look at it as a possible way to get profit. "HODL" most say in an attempt to make their BTC worth more. Terrible methodology. Spend. Buy more. Unless it's not wanting to see BTC become anything viable that you're after. Sorry for the rant - just tired of the two faced mentality of everyone here. People (supposedly) wanting Bitcoin to go places, then doing nothing but holding to try to earn money. Hypocrites... almost everyone here is.

Blockchain has been hacked before. They aren't an exchange, but they are an online wallet.

+1 As a programmer... I have to (basically) code a site in two formats... one for I.E., and one for EVERY other browser. It's a LITTLE more in depth than that, but that is the gist of it.

Miners need farms of ASICS these days. I'm not sure the use rate of this APP (don't do iThings), but even in the hundreds of thousands of users range, the multi-purpose nature of an iPhone is not conducive to mining - especially since nowhere near 100% of those users will be using the app at the same time. That on top of the fact that the app is apparently paying out 20-40 cents an hour to EACH user that is playing means this idea is unlikely.

What is it with you people thinking someone here has a crystal ball they aren't sharing. Sheesh. Get over it! We don't know. And what do you mean to keep your money's worth?! It's going to be worth the same amount whether it's at an online exchange (coinbase), your computer wallet, or a paper wallet/cold storage. It doesn't "hold value" or something depending on where it is. But I wouldn't keep it in an exchange... or on your computer for that matter - although that's a LITTLE better. I'd go paper or cold.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:24:41

@_date: 2015-01-07 22:33:06
You should STILL start with the getting started link. No news here changes that. Catch up on some security after that, namely paper wallets or cold storage. Stay away from exchanges except for purchasing and trading - move quickly to your own secure wallets.
Ask SPECIFIC questions about issues you don't get at that point. :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:43:02
This is where I get upset here actually... so many people using it as an investment instead of actually forwarding the BTC community by buying with it, then rebuying your spent coins. I keep a little in cold storage, but transact day to day with a hot wallet. Price doesn't mean much to me because I'll purchase BTC, buy a thing, then rebuy when I need to purchase another thing. Holding is fine, but it shouldn't be all you do with BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:22:26
Yes. It's understood. And while it's AGAINST THE RULES to post referral links here, (read the sidebar), it's often ignored if you also have the decency to post the non-referral link - which you did NOT have the decency to do. We all understand how referral programs work man... breaking rules and trying to be sneaky about it isn't helping you. It's not like the rule is hidden over there. --------&gt;

That comment is tongue in cheek. They are saying that as the crash continues, the value of what they had stolen decreases - essentially saying that if they held those coins until now, they lost less. If I had 1 coin stolen from Gox during that period, it'd be worth $700 less now than it was then. It's a comment in an attempt at comedy.

Not sure what they use... I go to restaurant, they show me a QR code to send to - I send. I go to a website that accepts and it's pretty much the same thing. I typically rebuy immediately what I just spent, but the past weeks I've been buying on an as needed basis - for obvious reasons. I definitely don't see buying and spending them as hurting the BTC economy, especially since most (MOST) of the places I shop at with BTC are not immediately cashing out for Fiat the next day. Just tired of everyone looking at this as a way to make money instead of doing anything to help out the cause.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:30:49
The problem continues to be people who won't spend. Acquiring is great, but not buying things with Bitcoin means, well... it's obvious - no Bitcoin market.

did a few pretty decent suggestions. I'm guessing you didn't do a SINGLE search on the question? Why is everyone here so god damn lazy and unwilling to do any type of (5 minutes TOPS) research on it!?!?
AND, did you honestly just say you don't know where or how to purchase, then IMMEDIATELY say where you've done it!?!? Jesus man.
@_date: 2015-01-10 18:18:54

Possibly one of them.

@_date: 2015-01-28 20:15:02
What?! This is EXACTLY like them... they've flatlined 3 or 4 times during drops this month alone. They aren't (Jesus this played out term) Gox'ing. Look up some Tweets from the last few times. They will be back soon and blame it on this or that as always. Why all the FUD with you people!?
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:46:22
You just aren't being clear... and the other posts here back that up. Are you saying you are buying BTC with fiat, then sending the BTC, then he's withdrawing into fiat? If that is so, there are your fees. You bring fiat into the equation on two separate accounts.
The questions on that scenario have been along the lines of why aren't you just sending from fiat to fiat? I.E., "Why is BTC brought up?". That is what I meant, and I don't understand your confusion.
Also, concerning the reply to my other answer... answered you VERY directly.
Your question... "Why is it more expensive to send money overseas with Bitcoin?" The answer, again very clearly, was that BTC has nothing to do with your high fees - it's the fact that you're bringing fiat into it multiple times.
The summary still stands. BTC to BTC = very minor fee. Bringing banks into it implies multiple fees.
You can send fiat to fiat for your $50, or BTC to BTC for nearly nothing. What no one gets is why the intermediary conversion.
At any rate, I'm sure there is still confusion on both ends - and I'm done seeing your post answered over and over here. Good luck.
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:25:30
What do you mean "there"? I keep a couple dollars in Changetip just for sending money here. Everything else I keep in paper wallets/cold storage... offline. No exchange had access to my coins.

Looks like a got it... tip sent! Woot woot!
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:30:01
Sending more BTC to it overtime is a good practice, however, when you wish to remove the BTC, SWEEP THE ENTIRE WALLET. Attempting to remove a partial amount from it will likely result in lost coins. I have several paper/cold storage wallets I regularly add to. :)

What's your purpose here? You need something removed on a website? And $3 helps with that? I'm a web designer and programmer if you'd like some help. Not sure where $3 would be any sort of payment to any one... but whatevs. You won't find many people here willing to do PayPal TX's for BTC, but I'm willing to help if I can with the problem. No transfers needed because these things typically scream fraud... so what do ya need?
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:19:20
They were having some issue to where their price was only showing the price as it was when Stamp went offline... $267.50 or something. Probably taken offline to fix that issue.

This is the type of fucking jerk shit that makes me glad I don't give a fuck about this sub anymore.  To answer his question, unlike this sorry troll ass excuse for a human begin, Blockchain.info is fine for storing small amounts of BTC... for hotwallet cases - where you actually plan to buy with it. If you want to STORE BTC, go with a paper wallet or cold storage. Little shits like this continue to fuck up the reputation of BTC by not explaining a god damn thing and making you feel like an idiot for asking. FUCK OFF.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:25:21
Hopefully there isn't a single person left who is STILL keeping an amount of BTC that is significant to them in an online exchange or service instead of paper or cold storage. I will NEVER again feel sorry for anyone losing their coins in these things with SOOO many lessons taught - especially recently.

BTC will never take off because 95% of every fucker here is trying to use it to make money. Plain and simple. The end. No one wants to spend - you all want to "hodl" and see your profit go up... then preach that you want BTC to succeed and be the dominant financial player while you aren't involved in making it happen. No one wants to buy, then ACTUALLY FUCKING SPEND, then buy again. It's nothing but a trading platform for you guys.

Sheesh. What a silly counter-argument. But fine, I'll bite for a second... replace BTC with USD. There. Do we want to argue what two years is in the history of gambling. It isn't even noticeable. My statement is about gambling what you can't lose in operations that are absolutely DESIGNED to take people's money. &lt;sarcastic&gt; Apologies that I didn't make the statement technical enough for you.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:12:22
Read a little bit on how to do it before you try though... Have a wallet there, Go to import/export, click okay at advanced warning, enter private key into "import private key" area, click add, click sweep at next screen. Dems da basics.

There are a couple services like this already (I'm pressed to name them at the moment, but miners like to use them). Personally, I prefer waking up the next day and having my BTC be worth $10 MORE.

It's happened at one point - gHash.io if I recall correctly. Poolers immediately left to join other operations to redistribute the spread. It's much harder these days with so many more options and players.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:11:05
Thing is more than 50% (yes) of businesses that accept BTC offer some sort of a discount for using BTC over other methods of payment - namely since THEY pay for credit card transactions.... equal or greater than your 1-2%. When they don't pay, they are more inclined to offer a small discount, easily covering your 1-2%. Next to that, it's a morals issue - which I can see not many here have. I've saved a shit ton by taking that sad little 1% loss and then getting a 20% discount by using BTC. Problem is people like you don't investigate - can't see past their initial little problem, and frankly, don't really care to. Taking ONE damn hour out of a day to see the deals in purchasing with BTC over fiat would save some people some money. People are lazy, herd mentality, media influenced sheep who will avoid any of their own research and fact finding with the desire for social acceptance at the cost of their own individuality and self sustainability. It's pretty freaking sad to me.

@_date: 2015-01-15 05:34:50
I stand corrected about the comments part of the rule. Still common courtesy to let someone know you're trying to make money off of them by posting a non referral link as well.
On another note, It has no explanation - it is not helpful. It names one of a million sites with no instruction assisting the user. This is OBVIOUSLY an attempt to gain a referral. It is on topic only in that they both pertain to BTC... and relevant in the same manner. I'm really not sure why you are defending an obvious attempt at another user trying to gain money without actually helping someone.
He almost directly said "Go online and sell them." So close that the idea of debating it is silly.
Odd to me you support this.
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:27:43
Coinbase CAN be instant if you link a Visa credit card. Circle is instant and takes debit cards - i.e., your average bankcard that even Paypal supplies linked to their accounts. This is my main method of purchasing via Paypal actually.

Would you be able to do this setting up an account with any other financial institution? You are trying to set up an account with a legitimate company that is legally required to maintain certain records. It's a little odd to me that people have no problem offering Bank Of America everything they want, then shudder at this.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:31:28
You should always spend BTC. :) It's what keeps the BTC economy growing. :) Keep a little aside (IN A PAPER WALLET OR COLD STORAGE, NOT AN ONLINE EXCHANGE) if you can afford it. Check the price every month or so. :P

Virwox will let you purchase SLL and exchange those for BTC but you end up with up to 30% in fees. The following solution is what I use, and is free. Convert your account, if it isn't already, to a business account - no special documents or anything needed. Order a Paypal debit card. It is linked to your Paypal balance... also free. Apply at circle and link that debit card. Instant purchase from Paypal with minor fee from Circle... 1-3%

What do you not like about paper wallets or cold storage? Honestly, if you're keeping your money on an exchange - no matter what the protection, you are less safe. If you ONLY are debating between the two, I would go with Coinbase. Again though, if these coins are just for hodling, then it's a bad idea.

No, you can't infer that based on... Oy, that strange observation. The greater percentage of the world only knows of Bitcoin and isn't even aware of other Cryptos. This, just... man... I don't even know where to start with this nonsense. You short-circuited me with that one.

A relative understanding of general markets is useful - but most people don't have it. The current BTC market is wildly unpredictable - but the general consensus is a rise to 'normality' soon (300-400?!). Whether that will be after a drop to $150... 100... 50 is up for debate. The worst could be over, the worst could still be coming. Perhaps the more knowledge you have about markets, the more you second guess. :P
That particular site I haven't dealt with since I am in the US. &lt;sigh&gt; This is tough - overall, I would NEVER keep any amount of BTC that is of significant value to you personally in an exchange such as these. PURCHASING there, no problem in 99% of cases! If you are planning on HOLDING/INVESTING then immediately transfer those funds to a paper wallet or cold storage. Do not keep what is valuable to you in an exchange after purchase.

A bit late to this... but here's how I do it. Convert your account to a business account (free). Order the debit card that is attached to the account (free). Apply to Circle, which allows you to attach a debit card (not just credit cards), then simply make the purchase with that card - instant and linked to your Paypal account. None of that silly mucking about in buying other things first business.

Something something no crystal balls here something something. Honestly the most recent decline was FUD. Basically, selling begot selling. The price went lower because the price was going lower. That kind of thing. People saw it sink some and sold - so it went down... which caused people to see it sinking and sell. Rinse, repeat until have only people that were going to hold until the bottom anyway and people who have now taken a substantial enough loss that they'd rather make it total than sell at such a reduced rate. Just my opinion the last 500 times this question was asked this week.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:27:02
Do keep me updated... Circle's limit of instant buying is figuratively KILLING me. Would love to be able to pay someone with card or Paypal for some minor coin at the moment.

A cold wallet is, basically, a text file (or image... or encrypted file) on a USB (or other external media) that contains the wallets private key. If you are talking about storing your wallet backup (i.e., wallet.dat) on a USB drive, that is simply a backup... not cold storage. Cold Storage means those funds can't be used until they are uploaded to an online wallet or exchange.
Don't store much in these online places... create a wallet offline using bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.com and  either print the wallet (paper wallet) or store on USB (cold storage) or BOTH! If you go USB, I use one of these...   **edit** Looks like the order page is currently down... but you can get these many places.

BTC down 60% for one year, up over 1000% in the 2 year, over 4,000% in the 5 year. Even if the 10% bit is true, who is that supposed to impress? LTC can be spent at 1/10th of the places BTC can? We can't even BEGIN to to say all of the places BTC is integrated with. On the note of scams... every currency will have them. EVERY.

You know, you'll make more BTC by just BUYING THE FUCKING BTC rather than giving to mining clouds or getting your own equipment these days. But I'm guessing you're not stupid enough to actually think you could still mine for profit when mining looks like this these days...  --- I'm guessing you just wanted to rile the group. :) ... ... ... You AREN'T that stupid are you?
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:15:55
Use a service like Bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.com (my favorite) to generate a wallet. **Do so by downloading their source and doing it offline - not on the online web version**. Print those generated wallets (paper wallet) or save to a flash drive (cold storage) or both and transfer from your exchange of choice... You can get much safer than this via a few more methods, but this is a good start. Don't lose that piece of paper or flash drive! You are your own bank at that point, and no one can recover those coins if you lose that info! For your first few times creating a paper wallet or cold storage, I recommend trying with $2-$5 amounts. Just to test the water. Also, learn about sweeping those wallets to an online service such as Blockchain.info should you need to remove the funds from them, and NEVER attempt to remove partial amounts from a paper wallet or cold storage. You could end up losing any remaining coin.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:24:10
Here... I want to show you what a mining setup looks like these days - since you have obviously not looked into it.
These guys solve here and there for a 25 BTC reward - and are having to shut down because they can't maintain. Your one measly miner will do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING by itself... which means you'll have to go to a pool... where you will be paid a share of what is discovered amounting to a tiny fraction of the reward... pennies.

I think the closest thing to what you are talking about is called a 51% attack, which GHash.io briefly touched on in the past. Many members jumped to another pool to keep that from happening.  They can't actually reverse it, though. This attack would have to be done as the coins were discovered, *I THINK*, which serves no purpose in this instance.

Paper wallet or cold storage if you're holding... never keep what is valuable to you on an internet connected device. A hot wallet for buying things is fine so long as that amount you keep there will not be a blow should it become compromised.

Did you put a stupid amount of money into it? Something that you would be destroyed by to lose? If you're upset by the declines, you've apparently not been using BTC (as I do) as an actual purchase medium, i.e., price doesn't matter... get your BTC, buy the thing you want. What happens 10 minutes later has no effect. I'm assuming you're trying to make money off of it though. And doing poorly.

Yeah - that's one reason... but personally, I think the biggest reason the price is falling now is because the price is falling now. Gets lower, people get scared - sell. Gets lower, and so on and so on. FUD. The bottom will be hit when those who were holding would rather take a complete loss than sell at such a discounted rate. No clue where that will be, but I'm personally in a position to ride it into the ground - so no fears here.

Percent wise, it's easy for almost any other currency than BTC to win this if they go up. LTC for example, from $1.70 to $3.40 would be 100% growth... If you change this poll to USD amount, I think the results would be different (should be anyway). The problem here is that most people are just going to vote for their favorite currency no matter what.
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:02:53
He's talking about the fact that BTC is down 68(ish)% for one year... up over 1,000% for two... over 4,000(some odd)% in the 5 year.

How quickly could you react after losing 5 mil? What more info do you expect them to share at this point - the method of the hack so it can be repeated before they are stable? They admitted a hack, are proposing a fix, and promised funds returned. There isn't much more that they can do unless you want them to just throw the same broken system back online or divulge information that would likely be detrimental to them. Seems thinking rationally can go both ways, man. And who knows if everything is okay! We'll find out before long or know it isn't.

Don't do it. Be honest and moral. If you're going to do it, just do two transactions and show them the evidence of it. Maybe they will listen with hard proof. If you've already given them hard proof, just let it go. If NONE of these things are options, and you're going to bleed them dry, pass off the coins to everyone here before you get caught and possibly put in a position where you can't get those coins anymore. :)

Well the most obvious reason during these current times is take into account Mt. Gox, or more recently Bitstamp. Gox lost 600 million dollars of users funds. Bitstamp only lost 5 million and vows to make sure everyone gets their coin back (they say they are coming back up later today), but the point is that centralized areas are vulnerable to hacks. Luckily Stamp, who we still hope fully recovers, kept more than 85% of their funds in cold storage - offline and away from the ability to be hacked. If you're going with a Vanguard account, then you're talking about an actual bank backed trading platform for mutual funds or ETFs, right? I'm not one to argue the current benefits of these accounts, but if you're going at BTC from a purely investment/money gain perspective instead of simply pushing the BTC economy then you'll have to decide for yourself if the BTC investment is worth it. Personally, I have no doubt as a long. Over the coming months the price may jump to $1,000. Of course, it could also plummet to $100. That's the fun of investing, eh?!! :) You're Vanguard MAY (many times not) provide a more stable investment, but the overall payout could be leagues smaller than your opportunity here. BTC is down over 60% last Year to year. Up over 1,000% in the 2 year, and something near 5,000% in the 5 year. It's a tough call and you'll get a million different responses. Best to do some research and see where you feel comfortable. And as my father always taught me while playing in the Amateur Pool Association, don't gamble more than you can afford to lose!

This wallet had 5 million in it... went to zero within a half hour after Stamp reopened. They appear to have funded it with near another 3 million. I personally just opened an account there where I'll do some of my trading for a little while (never used them before) since I approve of how they handled the situation. Their cold wallet(s) still show well over 30 million.

The problem with this is market saturation. The next coin below BTC, LTC, only has 10% of the acceptance of BTC. Anything is possible in the world of technology though - they'd just have to find a way to promote the VC better than BTC is being promoted and get all the vendors that already accept BTC to add that or switch. It's a lot to take on.

Thanks, I was just being silly and having fun with Changetip. It's understood that transactions aren't recorded until they leave the wallet. Appreciate the info anyway though! Maybe someone learned something by reading! :-D 150 bits

Faucets won't steal your coins - pretty much nothing can with just your address. But you aren't going to 'make a few dollars quickly'. You're going to make cents after hours and hours of clicking... likely for days.

"Let's All" have the same opinion posts are an instant turn away for me. Not sure what your point in posting this was, but no thoughts either way to you really - i.e., giving or taking silly internet points. The author, however, makes me lose focus just after 'let's all'... and it's clear it's for people against BTC.

I'm not beyond helping you with grocery shopping though. I'm gonna assume at your age and knowledge that you haven't surmounted VERY much yet and as such, we'll keep it to mostly a Ramen Soup diet.

You won't 'make' money... even if you aren't paying for the electricity, the days and weeks it will take you to earn a few measly Satoshi will make you sad. And then I will be sad because you are sad.
You have to remember, mining is handled almost soley by the GPU of a computer. A Mac Mini barely even knows what the term GPU means. :|

I think your downvotes are probably going to come from calling people trolls for having a different opinion than you.

That's the thing though - if people weren't holding, the value wouldn't matter. Get your Bitcoins when you're ready to make a purchase. Make the purchase. There ARE 10 minute streaks occasionally where the value changes enough to make a difference, but for the most part, if you just get the BTC then immediately buy the thing you want - the price is pointless!

Just because it may be the only option doesn't make it a good deal man. The two aren't mutually inclusive.

In fact, if it's true that they are the only option, then that's likely why they are able to rip people off to such an extent. Point : Lack of option does not mean a good deal.

On a more related note... are you trying to beg for BTC or something? Against the rules if so.

Another question that gets beaten to death here and simply not searched for for some odd reason. My MAIN method is simply attaching the free to order debit (read: not credit) card that will be attached to your Paypal account and then simply opening a Circle.com account and linking that card for instant purchases. Another method is Virwox if you want some outrageous fees. Another method is LBC. Another... and so on, and so on. Easy enough search man - but I recommend my first method. Cheap cheap cheap.

Believe me, as odd and far fetched as it may currently be to you to that some random individual (likely) 100's of miles away from you with no identifiable relation doesn't see the exact same image or gather the same relevance or emotion from an image we'll both forget in the coming days as you do... it has happened.

It doesn't take reading every thread here... it doesn't take ever touching Reddit. It takes a couple minutes of Google searching on the company you're choosing to have hold your money. I get what you're saying - the average person doesn't know the ins and outs of the Bitcoin world and wouldn't know all of the crap Garza has done, but a search of the name ALONE brings up results of investigation and fraud. Obviously more if you add "scam" or whatever other buzzword you want to the search. You don't even need a 'decent' knowledge of Bitcoin tech. You need the most simplistic understanding that who you store money with (best choice is yourself) is a safe option. You don't need 'drama'. You need the common sense to take 5 minutes out of your day to see who you're sending money to. If you've got enough money to just throw around with zero research Hal, then you are way better off than I am.

Old addresses still work with most clients. The point of new ones is to make so that no one knows how many coins you actually have.

If the getting started part threw you off, mining is way out of your league. Apologies for being so blunt. However, if you are SERIOUSLY interested in mining then start researching some mining ASIC's. You'll need a few hundred of them (at a few hundred bucks each) to mine on your own. You'll need to take into consideration that each one draws about as much power as a low output air conditioner. As such, if you have that type of funding, you'll ALSO want to make sure you're in a low to zero electricity cost area. Your other option is to join a pool... which will net you tons of pennies each month. Maybe even whole dollars sometimes. Take a look at what you're trying to compete with...

Any correspondence you have had with the buyer needs to be presented on your side of the dispute... emails, promises, and proof of transaction source, where he is offering the trade ESPECIALLY if he still is, etc. CALL and talk to them about it as well as sending info through a system and waiting and waiting. Keep in mind you'll have to call PayPal AND the company of whatever card he used tied to Paypal if there was one. Good luck though man. Hope you do okay. DON'T DO THIS. JUST DON'T.

The easiest way to get BTC with Paypal is to simply order the FREE debit card (read: not credit) that will be attached to the account, then simply use that with Circle.Com to withdraw directly from Paypal with Circle's standard fee.... not to pay $15 for a $10 card. Ridiculous.

You keep promoting your service with the continuous stipulation of not available in the US *YET*. Will it ever be? Are there plans? If there are, put them in this tired copy and paste you continue to do... at least say "We're working toward it. Expect it in 2nd quarter of 2016." or whatever. It's getting annoying how often you use the same line with nothing else to add - especially since you never reply to anyone with anything other than that "I'm a company that doesn't have you in mind" canned text BS. Develop some human responses. Communicate with people. Why are you trying to be just another sad forgettable exchange?!

$10 for one potato is absolutely fucking stupid. If I wanted the comical experience of mailing someone a potato - which I don't - it can be done for 1/5th (or less of) the price by simply doing it myself. I guess this is for people without a grocery store nearby. Or a post office. Or who actually believe a 5-10x markup for, I guess convenience, is okay. There's just not enough silly/comical value in this for me to justify spending $10 on 1 potato.

It's not 'bogged down'... well I guess you COULD look at it that way - it's going to be network wide, but what is happening is that a particularly difficult block(math problem) came up and the miner's equipment is having a tough time solving it.

They know the next person will just buy it from them with the 35% "markup". And overstock isn't a direct competitor for B&amp;N. When I worked at Office Depot, it's not like we could match eBay for items - OBVIOUSLY they will be cheaper! Did you get your item instantly after buying it Overstock? No you did not. Consider it a convenience fee - or something. They aren't losing money, they are making more by not giving you something 35% off. Not everyone has the same 'morals' as you, and 90% of people won't know about other options for getting it cheaper - and those that do would rather have it immediately instead of waiting. So no, they don't feel threatened, nor should they. They are in a different business.

There have been specific stories this last week. BITS acceptance by FINRA, US Marshall's upcoming 50,000 BTC auction, etc, etc. It's all speculation at this point - but the general idea is that SOMETHING is going to happen soon (the auction is tomorrow) with the attention it's been getting recently. Asking anyone what it's going to do is just plain silly - a wasted endeavor. Your two outcomes of asking 100 people what the market will do will be either 1)you get 100 different opinions, or 2)you get 50 people saying one thing and 50 people saying the other. Some get lucky. If you study market graphs (candlesticks, elliot waves, MACD lines and so on), you may be able to make an informed decision, but even then... this is BTC, it currently likes to make wild jumps in either direction. Here's hoping up is where it goes next.

Your remaining points continually state VIOLENT crimes, which I never mentioned - so please don't add it. I simply said VICTIMLESS.
At any rate, I can see everyone here has their mind made up - and completely disagrees with the actual stated law.
I never said (in fact, quite the opposite) that I liked the outcome... just that the law is what we go by. Your (sadly silly) comparison to Ford, Bud, etc simply names several things that are legal. You have no argument here. Again with the imaginary line stuff. It's simply law that none of us agree with.

With Coinbase, if you add a Visa Credit Card (Yes, has  to be Visa, yes, has to be credit and not Debit) then the purchases are instant. Otherwise, 4 business days. The charge is VERY small for most online wallets. If you want $70, you should feel screwed spending anything over $72. Circle would be less than $1 for that transaction I think. About Circle, they are instant with a little less hassle. For one, you CAN add a debit card - and it can be Mastercard or whatever. Furthermore, doing what I do, you can add your Paypal issued debit card linked to your Paypal account (free to get) and link that to Circle if you'd like instant purchases out of Paypal.

It's... really not. Not hard at all. Furthermore, we should hope it isn't hard as that's the most popular operating system in existence and adoption of BTC depends on it being accessible to the masses - i.e., those using Windows.

I'll do some research on it - but you may be right. The thing is, BTC isn't legally a currency - it is considered property however. How does it differ from other property considering it is not legally defined as a currency or commodity... simply property?
**edit** Just to be clear, I was assuming OP was talking about it being legal to sell the coins himself. Period. And it is. Period. There are just different regulations depending on where you are...

Looks as though it's a good idea to have a license depending on your country. Some HAVE called it a commodity - most are not calling it a currency... some don't classify it at all. This article in general talks about arrests made of LocalBitcoins operators.

This is silly...
"The reward will go one of two ways.
If the winning response is something we can implement ourselves, say donate the 1 bitcoin to a charity, then we will do that. In this case the winning post author will also receive an additional .10 BTC to their personal account for creating the winning submission.
If the winning response is something we (Backed Staff) cannot implement, then the bitcoin will be sent directly to the winning author.
As you may be able to guess, we'll likely favor posts that take the first approach as it allows us to verify that the bitcoin is used as the poster describes. However, we will not discount the second approach and are willing to send one bitcoin to the winning user should they provide a compelling and winning post."
You're directly stating that pretty much anyone with a decent idea of how to use the funds themselves will simply be ignored. I'm glad I read these instructions. I considered sending a post concerning a recent thread I started pertaining to ideas on a BTC based website (which I've now purchased domains for and have started implementing). Some of these ideas require capitol... or BTC stock, and I am not exactly BTC rich. If you're only going to favor posts that don't involve the author actually WINNING the BTC, then you should leave that entire paragraph out of your page - so at least participants won't know they are wasting their time.

Yeah, but keep in mind... you'll be paying WELL WELL above market price going this route. If that doesn't matter to you, move on with it. Your 15k will cost you hundreds more at best. These are basically people that buy the coins legit... as should be done, and then sell them at whatever markup they feel like because some people think that this is a needed step to remain anonymous (silly). But yes, you have the gist of it. Create an LBC account, agree to the outrageous markup (IF you can find someone selling that much locally... going to be tough), then show up with your $15,750-$17,000 for for 15k of BTC. Good luck I guess man.

Wow... A plus side comment about Wal Mart - that's new. The reason Wal Mart will be around isn't because they are that 'smart' in the sense you're talking about, it's because they carry cheap products purchased from countries they don't operate in, pay their employees absolute shit and use those two facts to build new stores - where they rinse and repeat the process. And while they also price match, they won't do it with many online only retailers as well... personal experience. I get that you're angry at Barnes and Noble for not giving you a discount you didn't deserve... so we're obviously seeing this from two different vantage points. Let's part ways and be done with it.

The current size is what? 30 gigs? Let's say it gets to 25 times that (even though the first 30 took five years), you're still looking at under 1 TB (750 gigs). Which is VERY cheap these days. Let's say it gets to over 133 times the size at 4000 GIGS!!! Even 4 TB hard drives aren't exactly obsurd - and by the time the chain reaches that number, the cost will be likely the same as 1 TB is now... or less. All this while, computing power increases while its cost decreases. Tech should have no problem keeping up.

Not sure how many times this needs to be covered. Your calculations are probably right.. What are you expecting to 'earn' with ONE miner (ESPECIALLY if you're paying an average electricity cost) when fighting against the average mining organization who has HUNDREDS of miners and VERY LOW electricity costs. If you're paying electricity at all, the only way you will make money MAYBE is by joining a pool - which will put you on par with your first estimate. ;) I'll look over the screenshot and see if anything is wrong - I'll back if there is... but man, a single person mining alone. Just no. You'll go in debt so fast. Each one uses about as much energy as a small low output air conditioner.

Why wouldn't you RESEARCH where the hell you put your money before you do it? Basic Google searches bring up so much bad news about this guy and his company! This is a weird way of thinking... you don't freaking need to be on Reddit or visit a certain sub - you need to take 5 minutes out of your day to research where you're sending your money! It's common damn sense man, not something only Reddit visitors or people who 'read all the bitcoin news' know... it's just the thing you do when sending money away; AGAIN, unless you're so well off that you don't really care about that.

All good points... I'm in a position where I can buy a TB hd when I need to in order to continue helping the network which I guess tons aren't.
It's been mentioned as a flaw in Satoshi's design in the past to not award people who run full nodes and only miners... so maybe some form of that could be implemented. At least partial cost coverage for people that continue to support the network could offset the loss of full nodes when this number starts to get outrageous.
At any rate... If Visa can create and handle their network, BTC sure the hell can. :P

The problems with Paypal directly are this... 1)Chargebacks. Paypal allows them and that simply doesn't play nice in the BTC world at the moment. Not good to be able to buy BTC then get your money back and have both. 2)Terms of Service... By the nature of their business, Paypal considers themselves in competition with BTC - They've fought off companies several times trying to take money out of their ecosystem to place it in theirs... viciously.
I mean, there's crap like using Virwox to purchase SSL with Paypal (since SSL can only be used in one place... second life), then converting that to BTC - but you end up with ridiculous fees for that. Like 20% I think.
Basically it's just too easy to screw people over with Paypal, hence no one/not many doing it. I'm pretty happy having found a way to use Paypal through Circle. Until (if/when) it becomes globally standardized as a currency - there's going to be HOURS &lt;sigh&gt; or maybe 2 days of waiting on the first purchase.

That's nice but, while no one entity may have the power to set the market price - and even that may be up for debate - it seems that the largest groups are all in cahoots anyway... meaning they can together decide what they'd like.

I'm gonna go through this one yet again... My method follows:
Get a Paypal account, order the debit card that you can get for free that is linked to that account, start a Circle.com account, link your new Paypal debit card to Circle, Voila - instant Paypal purchases.
For the credit card bit, you have to simply not even be trying. Coinbase.Com, Circle... the list goes on and on for Credit Card acceptance. From reputable people... not the likes of a site with INSANITY in their freakin' name. Heh.

You should research what's already been done with BTC radio transmission research and practice. Pretty interesting, but there are a lot of alternative ways to transmit the chain transactions. BTC may not be the end all crypto, or it may be, but there will always be ways - even if low tech - to broadcast transactions.

It doesn't, necessarily... but I think that depending on a small set of public purchasers, it could affect things either way. A lot will simply look at this as 50,000 more coins in the system... which would be a little bit of a cause for value to reduce (which is a little sad with over 13 million in circulation... 50k doesn't even touch the bucket). But on the opposite end of that same spectrum, a purchase from an entity like the Winklevoss twins may promote a bit of a following - as it could likely mean the funding or continuation of their ETF to compete with BITS (if they had their act together, that competition would be the other way 'round). There's also always the option that everyone collectively says "Meh." and not a damn thing happens... wouldn't be the first time. Good ol' speculation. It's classic BTC.

@_date: 2015-02-19 18:26:06
You need to plan ahead more. Simple as that. Not even far, just a couple of days. It's easy to purchase with Paypal via an attached Debit Card through Circle.Com. In fact, It's pretty easy to purchase with a CC or DC in a lot of instances. I don't care that you're buying drugs... or whatever else the DNM's have to offer. You're leaving yourself with pretty much the only option being purchasing via LBC or a local meetup through Mycelium (or something similar). Tumbling is a fine additional step if you wanna go that far. A simple search here or through Google will bring up options. Bitcoinfog comes up first. I'd go through the evolution marketplace over Agora or the multiple failure SR. The fact that you've obviously done zero research means you shouldn't do this stupidity just yet. Or ever. VERY simple searches answer all of your questions - you're going to get yourself into trouble proceeding as you are. Good luck though... I don't wish harm to anyone.
*edit* On an added note, unless you're purchasing digital goods on the DNM's, you aren't going to get anything for several days.

Please start by reading the "Getting Started" and "FAQ" links on the right. ----&gt; Why are you afraid to make an account somewhere (not required EVERYWHERE, but it's pretty standard fare to do so)? You're obviously trying to do something nefarious... but there are easier ways to become anonymous AFTER setting up an easy way to get the coins to begin with. How much are you looking to buy? You may have some luck with LocalBitCoins, Mycelium or someone here (ahem) taking another form of payment for them. You're just going to end up getting yourself into trouble this route though.

Couldn't tell ya really... Took me checking the chain down to the 4th one before it became accurate. 1FeexV6bAHb8ybZjqQMjJrcCrHGW9sb6uF has a good 19 mil. :)
I use a Google Chrome extension called "Bitcoin Sneak Peek" though that shows on the page an info button to click which instantly displays received and current balance for any BTC address typed within the current page. 
Pretty useful for spottin' that kind of stuff right away. I think that page used to be right - not sure what happened to those top 3 address, and I stopped after finding 19 mil in the 4th.

The best way to do this would be to include an address and QR code on your posters... BUT - it would have to be donated to an already established charity that accepts BTC and is verifiable by information on the poster. You aren't going to find many - or maybe even any - people who will donate to from Reddit... even with good thoughts in mind. Heh. Populated areas are best though... but ANYWHERE is good. Hop on the tube and post 'em up in places. If you ARE going with an established charity, you might ask a few businesses/shop owners if you can place them on their windows or in the shop.

Quick question before I head out (Jupiter Ascending at iMax - will it be good?! I hope so)... Try not to take this as argument or whatever it is that seems to get people here so riled up... just a question. What is it that makes an asset highly demanded if it isn't the ability to trade it for good or services? What I'm asking is this... Would the Bitcoin be highly demanded if it couldn't be used to trade or purchase items with? My thought is that simply holding something... ANYTHING is pointless unless others are proving that the thing in question has value by purchasing (trading is almost the same as purchasing here... purchasing dollars with BTC or BTC with dollars). An asset, in my mind, won't be "highly demanded" until it has value. It won't have value until people consider it as a currency or a commodity that can be traded for profit. It won't be considered as such until people actually use it as such and merchants/vendors accept it as such. The merchant in your scenario simply won't accept it to trade to dollars if there is no market to accept it. Again, Just a question. 500 bits @_date: 2015-02-24 16:44:13

If you want to actually withdraw, as in to cash (fiat), Circle has a withdraw tab for that... You will need to have a card (debit or credit) or a bank account linked to withdraw to. If you want to spend, you can do it directly from your Circle wallet. If by 'local', you mean a paper wallet or cold storage device such as a flash drive, you can do that at any time, in any amount... those funds can't be spent or withdrawn though until they are put back on an exchange by 'sweeping' the wallet with a service like that offered at Blockchain.info.

Who knows man, they aren't saying anything which likely means they've run... but...
This is the SECOND (third?) time this exchange has been hacked in a very short period. If you STILL had coins there after that - thank goodness they're gone. Time to get smarter.
I'm not a DOGE or BTS enthusiast, so I'm not sure how they work so much... do they have cold storage and paper wallet options like BTC? If so, man - why wasn't your coin in that setting? If not, man - why would you go with an insecure coin? :P Either way, the ol' "This exchange was recently hacked... guess I'll keep my coins there." idea doesn't span out. This goes for those still keeping coin on BitStamp as well.
On a serious note, if someone isn't actively trading or buying, why would they keep a coin in an exchange?

@_date: 2015-02-17 21:35:41
Yeah, It all requires verification, I think - it's been a while... I just guess that isn't as much of a problem for me as it seems to be for most people here since I don't use my BTC for drugs and the like and as such I have less a concern with anonymity DURING THE PURCHASE PHASE. I have no problem with verification, and if I need to become anonymous on some nefarious whim, I'll just wash the coins - which is cheaper than going through a service like LBC. Also, in my area - the LBC dealers are marking up about $40 or more on today's price. Just can't do it. That's the good thing about BTC though, right! So many options!

Coinbase ONLY allows VISA (read: not even Mastercard) for purchases, and ONLY credit cards, not debit.

On January 26th, the cost of one BTC was about $10 higher (give or take a few dollars depending on when you purchased throughout the day). Today it is worth less. In a few days you could have .3 BTC that is worth 60 Pounds. You didn't realize the market fluctuates?

$15,000 amounts are purchased regularly, though they often require in person meetings. Why are you worried about being 'suspicious'? Posting like that is all that makes it suspicious so far. "Where can I buy 15k of BTC?" would have been a fine question. Congrats, now you're suspicious. Have you not watched the chain scroll by for an hour? The $20,000 transfers and higher? Questions like these pretty much always mean the start of an upcoming risky transaction that borders on legality or completely dismisses it.

Then you'd only be a partial ass and they'd tear you up during the purchase... likely making you lose the domain at zero cost (for obvious reasons) or cause you to sell at a loss... which was probably under $15 a year to begin with. :P

For instance, eBay does 10% at a certain price point... add any small transaction fees for buying BTC and you've outdone the most prominent player in costs.

Fine, fine... no "you're dreaming" with the energy bit... how 'bout a look at common mining operations? 
Your 1 ASIC miner will be profitable, I suppose, with unlimited near free energy... unfortunately your life is not near unlimited - working at McDonald's will pay off SOOOOO much faster than trying to profit from a single miner. You need hundreds - unless you're happy with a few Satoshi a month - which is LITERALLY what you will get in a pool. Cents. If you're lucky, a whole dollar. Why does no one get the immensity of mining these days!?!?!?!??! Argh.

And if you're relating some recent market fluctuation or some recent public opinion of the relation between the two (please show the  poll/opinion site) - then you're just as whacked as the general public in their thoughts. I say that because this over played ISIS nonsense has been posted here several times every week for AT LEAST 2 months now.... and everything keeps moving along as always.

If popularity reaches that point, .001 BTC may be worth what 1 BTC is now. The average person wouldn't strive to be part of the "21 million club" with their 1 BTC, but part of the same club with their .001 BTC. Not to mention the ways that are in the works to further expand quantity perception... such as further denominations. Add a zero once value reaches a certain point and voila. This is almost a BTC 101 class subject for as many times as it's brought up here. 21 million coin limit is of no concern.

I'll have to research a little - but at the moment, you're charging more than a lot of other store options. I can sell items elsewhere for cheaper. Even if not - the double digits alone will scare off a lot of people. 9.9 even seems less scary than 10. But a 9 or 8 would do even better - and you still would have competition... but it looks far more friendly than adding that second digit with 10.

What are the advantages of owning one single miner, even with free cost? That bastard MAY get lucky one day and discover a 25 BTC reward (or 12.5 soon), but it's unlikely - unlikely being an overly hopeful view. :P So, Does it help speed up the discovery of the next block for others to increase confirmation rates or what? I've just been completely screwed over by pools and won't touch them. Sorry. Slush's ran off with about $500 and a couple other pools ran off with lesser amounts. Simply won't let it happen again. Story over. That being said, is there any benefit to the network solo mining understanding that there will in all likelihood be a negative cost differential should ANY maintenance be required? Just looking to help the network - not profit in this case... if it doesn't help, the answer is clear. :)

Laundering is often the BEGINNING of many a serious crime - involving victims, such as points 2, 3 and 4 below.
(2)Computer Hacking - Invasion of privacy is something you advocate?! There is hardly a case where this is 'victimless'. The entire purpose of hacking is usually to fuck someone over.
(3)The multiple drug charges (trafficking/distribution) - This one I was part of myself, as I said, and STILL believe he is guilty of it. You have any idea how many OD's took place with products ordered from his site?! How many relationships were ruined and how much money was wasted for this purpose... this one I just feel silly for arguing about.
(4)Trafficking fraudulent identification - Ability for illegals to enter any country they choose to commit any crime they want under a false personification. Some of these were just teens wanting to buy beer - but some of these were VERY bad people wanting access to certain parts of the world to further cause damage to people
Listen, like I said - I wish he didn't go down. It's sad... and I'm a DNM fan. But there is NO arguing that these people are innocent and ESPECIALLY that there is no victim!!! It's ludicrous and not thought out to state that... even if you're with me on wishing he wasn't found guilty.

1) Builders, by design, aren't going to have a whole heck of a lot of customization options. As a designer, I regularly use aMember on my clients sites (amember.com) both as a gate to make sales and simply a page access barrier, i.e., your posting reviews bit. The software is a couple hundred bucks but well worth it.
2)Yes across the board on this one... BitPay can be used to register users via the aMember Bitcoin plugin, as well as for products afterwards. There is an awesome interface/backend on aMember alone for showing orders for every product ordered... if you need it, I can show you an example with a screen shot of one of my clients' previous orders list.
3)Wallet integration isn't extremely tricky either - this is the type of site where people will want to buy several things over and over, i.e., keep a withstanding balance on your site?
Anyway, you're welcome to PM me if you think there's anything else I can offer.

The regulation is getting closer and closer to falling in line with it... not to mention the registration requirements. Why you feel the need to insult... why MOST people here feel the need to insult people in the same community following the same basic ideals, I'll never get. This sub seems to be at constant war with itself. We should become a community of offering our OPINION of corrections to statements made by others - pointing out our interpretations of facts/views/evidence instead of attacking the few that actually believe in the same things we're doing. There's no need to tear down our own infrastructure like this. Be productive in the narrow grouping of BTC enthusiasts.

Yeah, that's the problem with my charity - Children's doesn't accept it and I convert to fiat to give to them... or more typically just donate USD.

Misunderstood question OP... Copy Paste from a lower response. "**edit** Just to be clear, I was assuming OP was talking about it being legal to sell the coins himself. Period. And it is. Period. There are just different regulations depending on where you are...
Found several articles with stories similar to this... 
Looks as though it's a good idea to have a license depending on your country. Some HAVE called it a commodity - most are not calling it a currency... some don't classify it at all. This article in general talks about arrests made of LocalBitcoins operators. "
Seems the LBC busts were made on people who specifically said they were going to use the BTC to buy stolen credit cards too. Looks like if you're going to set it up as a business or even a non business large scale venture, then you need to get a license... which could take several years.

That's the difference between 51 and 65 coins with your 15,000. And that isn't going to be solid all the time. It's up to each person and whoever is in your area to set their own markup that you can take or leave. Personally, no way on Earth would I pay for 65 coins and only get 51. (Simply math of 15,000/290 and /230). I just don't have those extra couple thousand to waste on fees though. :/ You are, quite literally, tossing out over $3,000 on that transaction.
I've heard of some banks that don't like people dealing with BTC for some reason - but I'm not sure of the legitimacy of it. Just ask your bank straight up before you do it if you're that concerned. But whatever exchange you end up going with is going to have NO PROBLEM with that kind of money coming into their system. ;) Of course, if you're looking to do nothing but store it (sigh), you'd better be moving it off to cold storage pretty quickly anyway.

Chargebacks is the number one concern. But, there are ways - some easy - to buy with Paypal. It's my main source. The easiest (and VERY cheap) way to do so is to simply order a (free) Paypal debit card for your Paypal account and attach it to Circle.Com. Instant Paypal purchasing. Like I said, There are several other methods too, but you start ending up with fees on some of them.

I can only speak for myself... Over $1,500 purchased since they started - all instant, and no trouble. But I'm sure there are horror stories also. Support has been super fast if you don't want to call, and the people that answer when you do call are laid back and professional. It is one of the two most commonly suggested methods here (the other of course being Coinbase) but again, I'm sure someone has had a bad experience. I have multiple accounts with various exchanges... maybe you should give that a go? Start something at Circle, then Coinbase... wherever, purchase in $10 amounts or what not and see which experience you like best. Transfer from the other wallets to there and go with that one. :) (Then of course, transfer offline - unless you're trading or purchasing)
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:42:07
My standard answer every time this is asked goes like this... The method I use is to order a debit card (not credit card) to attach to your PayPal account - this is free. Open a Circle.Com account and link that debit card to them. Purchases are instant and come directly from your PayPal account at a VERY small fee. Your remaining options are going to net you a LOT of fees or a buy cost sometimes 10-15% above market value... BUT, those options include using Virwox - where you can purchase SLL (Second Life Currency) via Paypal, convert those to BTC, then withdraw that. Expensive, and the first time takes 48 hours. Your other options include things such as Local Bitcoins or using the Android Mycelium app. Again though, you'll be paying well above market price doing that. LBC and Mycelium vary in time it takes... hours to days.
