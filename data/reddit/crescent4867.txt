I don't 'hate core" I just find it sort of odd that they sit on such high moral horses vs. any alternative in an open source environment that they actually have the balls to call other developers "terrorists" for building alternative solutions

And that's only a problem if you believe that AWS is more likely to have multi-node failures at a higher rate than let's say At&amp;T which in my experience isn't the case.

Or you know, buy mining hardware instead of sitting on the sidelines waiting for free money and whining like children about how "China is taking over mining" with $500 million in BTC sitting unused.

This post hasn't aged well even in the last 24 hours. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:44:43
Doesn't matter what they are called. If you sit on the sidelines holding while you whine about what people that actually built the network are doing then you are simply pathetic.

Complains that small group tries to split to 2x, only to use "famous nerds" as proof of it being a bad Idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:31:25
Doesn't it always?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:20:15
Terrible argument in every possible way. Holders are useless to the ecosystem compared to traders, spenders, miners etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:19:05
If you don't recognize that transaction cost limits usage cases and exposes Bitcoin to competition you don't understand what's happening. No, 2x wasn't a great idea, but neither is trusting side chains and private entities to perform second layer payments.

Losing money, and an exchange listing and promoting an asset that disappears overnight are different things. 
I agree totally that people have themselves to blame, but exchanges share the blame. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:52:00
Almost $1 per year. Shame on them for running a business. Jesus, you want a hug?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:04:11
I disagree. If you provide a financial product you have a responsibility to not do so recklessly. Listing a future that reaches zero on a single statement is reckless. 
I'm not saying it's illegal, or that people shouldn't do research but it's still reckless. 
Like building a roller coaster and having a sign that says "may be unsafe" doesn't mean you are free of blame if it fails and you knew there was a 30% chance of it happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:13:02
Rational. You came to the wrong place for that ��
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:18:02
I still will never trust someone who 'supports the ecosystem' by never spending any Bitcoin. Pretending that 'holders' bring value is a mental illlness. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:33:37
That's not a valid counter argument. Just a subjective opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:40:20
It's hardly a valid argument for SegWit when 4/5 wallets used still overcharge fees. I'm fully aware that I can use core etc. But 95% of Bitcoin users send and receive using Jaxx, Blockchain, Mycelium etc. And are not technically savvy enough to calculate fees and manual send. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:12:34
Oh trust me, lots of people are propagating the "it's just never gonna retrace. Hold no matter what"
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:16:33
'surge' .. more like hiccup followed by drop below 24 mean. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:41:00
That feeling when the person you comment on is too dumb to read your post history before whipping his micro-epeen out. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:34:08
Your reply shows that you don't understand how it works. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:58:39
Dread Pirate Roberts. Hero of crypto for selling drugs and trying to assassinate people. Roger Ver "he's a criminal for selling fireworks". Yeah. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:55:54
The fact that people think bitcoin is going to just casually rally to $100k without any serious retrace/crash is also pretty sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:30:41
And yet 90% of the posts here are circje jerk tweets from core devs and opinion pieces. Ironic. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:21:18
Yeah, I'm sure Vinny has done less for Bitcoin than you and your 0.2 BTC paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:38:39
My point is that the network does, not, care where nodes are. As long as they are backed by funds they have the same right to signal and verify transactions. Pretending that some nodes are "fake" is just pointless and if you pretend to understand how bitcoin works, you should know this. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:24:16
By handing over control if payments under $1000 to Blockstream. Phew, at least that way no small group of elitists will control.... Oh wait...
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:48:39
So writing code that is specifically incompatible with other open source clients, censoring and paying people to post and threaten competition isn't bad now? All proven behavior (on both sides). 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:46:55
Virtually propping up something failed doesn't help it. If it can't survive in normal market conditions then the core implementation doesn't deserve to exist. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:57:59
"I don't read the terms of the service I use" isn't really an excuse though. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:15:27
If you think they didn't make a massive amount of money on the entire spectacle you aren't very bright. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:17:50
You can't demand high security, service and features and whine about $1 a year fee for a service. Well, you can but it's childish and stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:09:26
Not sure how that applies to any of this but sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:48:02
Point? How is AWS worse than other cloud services or shaky home nodes that people take down to play Xbox?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:14:10
Agreed. But that's not how the product was sold. At all. 
And that's my point. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:46:59
Oh dear. It's like a petting zoo here. I wonder how many knuckle dragging morons think the core devs 'built the system'. There are over 100 devs who commit, and less than 10 that run and whine about things on Twitter. And the overlap between them and Blockstream and other side chain projects is high. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:15:47
If I am incorrect, please feel free to correct me. I'm fairly certain that the statement is not faulty and half the point of the rushed upgrades for core before BCH was to establish dominance of nodes that rejected non-core transactions. 
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:31:22
Exactly what part is "retarded" except you not reading the terms of the service and not wanting there to be one?
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:05:13
And you are awfully sure of yourself for someone who apparently is unaware that Blockstream was funded by some of the most prominent developers of past and current core client. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:13:33
There are at least 10 people that sit on 50,000+ BTC whining about Chinese miners and "CEOs" trying to "attack Bitcoin" all while doing nothing but wait for free money. 
Sorry, if you don't do anything yourself, you don't have a vote. Period. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:10:29
"gonna" yeah I stopped reading there. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:43:53
I am fully aware of how lightning, thunder etc. Works. And claiming that it's trustless is simply not true. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:42:15
If you launch an asset and promote it full well knowing that there is a I'm mediate risk that purchase lose all their money you are at least sort of an asshole I would argue. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:43:17
No grudge. I just think they play a dirty game, just like the 2x group. They just pretend they don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:14:40
In his defense. Consider the fact that a fucking exchange that pretends to be legitimate sold him 'futures' of something they couldn't even be certain would exist. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:08:41
The latest core release rejects transactions from other client builds even though they are specification compatible. 
And everyone that's been active in crypto for more than a year knows that Theymos and the most prominent core developers have a give and take relationship. Evident by the fact that this sub censors discussion related to other developments than core. 
And yes, isn't better by any means. But pretending that they are somehow alone in spreading propaganda is simply juvenile. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:24:49
Tell me again how SegWit has solved the issue so far? My $14 'normal fee' Jaxx transaction asking. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:16:22
Oh dear... You aren't that dumb are you? Oh well. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:41:16
Ha ha ha. Oh, absolutely not the same people at all. �� That's why the rules of the sub is that you can't discuss other clients or solutions than core. The needed platform for Blockstream side channels. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:10:47
That's as stupid of a belief as trickle down economics. And if you believe that someone simply "owning" a billion dollars contribute to the economy as much as someone using it to build a company, well... I guess that's cute.
You are obviously entitled to do whatever you want with your Bitcoin. But if you choose to do nothing, while someone else spends it to further the ecosystem, then don't pretend "I did it", cause you didn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:02:13
Surely this friendly and not at all bitchy attitude is what brings new users to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:50:56
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:20:57
Still no fucking clue as to why people think Holders are some kind of heroes. They bring nothing to the ecosystem, and have managed to make people believe they are important. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:31:53
So miners are "attacking" but core simply dictating how it should work is fine?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:15:44
Signed by core. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:46:34
There's that famous attitude that led to all the fork. Go core!

Do you hear yourself? "There is only one open source project.." It's like you don't even understand how code works. 
Seriously, you are so dumb it's a miracle that you can get dressed in the morning with that view on crypto.

No. An enemy of Core. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:43:38
Oh dear. This is why we can't have nice things. Noobs that doesn't even get the concept of open source think they have valid opinions. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:05:35
Longest chain doesn't determine what is Bitcoin, mining power doesn't determine what is Bitcoin, miners don't, community doesn't, so.. let me guess, core developer opinion does right? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:53:10
And node owners are heavily invested right? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:20:10
Snappy comeback child. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:53:11
Oh goody. Some child that believe that Bitcoin account registration is the day someone discovered crypto . . Yes, that's how it works. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:16:43
Oh look it's the "everyone should run a node" madness again. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:03:18
That doesn't compute at all since fax machines fills no function what so ever that is even remotely close to a node. 
Learn how nodes work before you attempt to 'explain' it to anyone. 
The comparison you are looking for us 200 bank accounts. But it's also a pointless comparison since me owning 200 nodes is exactly the same as 200 people running nodes as long as I put the same economic weight behind them. 
Something miners have no problem doing. 
The network doesn't place any value on users, or people, and you thinking it does just showcases that you have no clue as to what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:46:08
You can't whine about miners having no power and then complain when they spin up nodes. Go ahead and spin up 50% of network hash rate in mining power. Should be easy right?
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:05:41
You can run nodes all day long. That doesn't mean a coin with no hashrate and 45 min blocks is useful. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:11:00
Ha ha ha. Yeah, that's probably not how anything works. At all. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:57:36

@_date: 2017-10-30 20:50:20
Hey Max, tell me more about how Maxcoin and Startcoin were not premined shitcoins you pumped and dumped in noobs. 
Yeah, go fuck yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:10:26
If you didn't just hold your coin expecting people to spoon feed you profits and invested in mining instead you wouldn't have to whine about "the miners".
