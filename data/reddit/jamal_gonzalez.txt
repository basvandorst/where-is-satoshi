can you explain this part?
2. It protects your bitcoins in case someone steals your Recovery seed from you. Without your passphrase the thief won’t be able to access your coins.
how does the passphrase protect against a stolen seed? isn't the seed all that's needed to import into any new wallet?

How easy is it for a bitcoin "millionaire" to dump all his coins and transfer them into actual USD? Like those people who had thousands of bitcoins when it was worth 1000$+, is it reasonably easy to find enough people to pay you that kind of money for your bitcoins?
For example, the coinbase website lists 50K USD as a daily limit, it would take forever to sell all your bitcoins there

I'm so sick of these people messing with our money. Their attitude towards just breaking the system to replace it with a new one is infuriating.

How does the 95% voting work ? Do they count the percentage after every 1000 blocks or after every block in the 2 weeks?

not really, 5% is very easy to overcome. The entire mining community would need to come up with an extra 1% to win. It would be very hard for anyone with 5% to keep up with that.

but any service that needs to know your real world identity is going to ask you for proof regardless of BIP75. I can't transfer money from my bank to my coinbase account without giving them my ID and bank info.
