I'm not. Buy buy buy and sell sell sell will keep the same fluctation, "currency" that will never be picked up by any retailers because you would have to be mad, I assure you.

Great, more faggotry from @_date: 2014-01-29 22:54:07
It's quite tragic, I assure you.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:15:51
Except that until users treat it more than a get-rich-quick-scheme it never will, and it never will.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:44:55
That accounts existed for 2 months, mine for 7. By your logic every other user in this thread is just you.
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:25:05
Thank you!

Oh bitcoiners, stay childish.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:23:13
I love that Dogecoins, the parody, is somehow a far better currency. I love the world.

A few of the big name retailers in small sects of the world as a test run that are probably regretting their decision right now.

But no one cares. In 3 years, if I was at a bar talking to a woman and said "You know, I got one of the first developer kits for Google Glass", she literally couldn't be less impressed.
It's also such a pointless thing to be proud of. You foollishly lost money. Whoop-de-Do, I built a chair last week.

You know where to find me in a moment of childish doubt. I'm always here for you buddy. When you only saw 1 pair of footsteps that's because I was carrying you.

Can you even read? He posted a month ago. I know this is probably hard to believe, but some people have better things to do that go on reddit.

I'm sayin' all asian chicks are hot.

Amazing comeback.

Noop, just a bystander watching the insanity, looking at bitcoin users like I'd look at a dog smoking a cigarette.

Just want to get into the minds of bitcoiners and find out their backwards logic on how this is a good thing.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:20:16
The users never treat it more than a ponzi scheme. All it will ever be is "OH SHIT PRICE IS CHEAP BUY BUY BUY SELL SELL SELL", continuing this vicious circle of being a shit currency, and it will never change.
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:57:50
Hot asian chicks is redundant.

Gold's been valuable for 6000 years. It's not going to happen.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:08:51
Yes, and it also goes down. Way the fuck down.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:26:15
How does that make it a currency? When it goes up, sure it's grand, but it doesn't stay up. It falls down frequently and I can guarantee it. How does that make it a good currency?
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:11:58
There is money that doesn't turn to dirt. It's called real money.

That doesn't mean anything though. He's one of the hundreds of people who got in early that no one will know, nor will they care. He ain't getting a letter from Mr. Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:37:30
So they aren't a currency then? So they are a ponzi scheme then based on nothing with no intrinsic value?
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:21:16
You call him 40 years old, yet you fuck his mother.
The real joke is on you fucking an 80 year old woman.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:02:37
For actually using it as a currency, it's terrible because, let's say amazon starts accepting bitcoin, then overnight they've lost over half their profits. It doesn't take that long for even amazon to go out of business.
