The masses are not interested in education on finance or how the world works, but they line up to see the newest reality trash tv shows or spend countless hours on social media. Maybe a reality show about crypto could trigger some interest.

i don't think the corrupted united nations (which is mainly driven by the super powers) has done anything worth while since its inception, to make a successful world currency, which if they did (lets imagine that for a second) i wouldn't trust it or touch it with a 10 foot pole.

He actually proposed that greece implements a digital currency parallel to the nation currency , he called it "Plan B", all citizens would have been issued a wallet address linked to their Tax Registration Number. He got the boot from the government for this idea and his management of the negotiations with the Euro Working Group. Why Yanis as a finance minister didn't you buy bitcoin in 2015? A few billion dollars worth would have changed the debt level of Greece.

There is a detailed report (coinshares research) about how BTC mining is dominated from renewables
there is another comparison that shows that the existing financial infrastructure consumes a lot more energy 
worldwide , from datacenters, cloud servers, regional servers, etc. 
I would like to see some hard numbers and facts, what is exactly the amount of energy consumed in mining
 compared to the rest of the industries in china?

 Almost **half** the world — over three billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day. At least **80%** of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. More than **80 percent** of the world's population lives in countries where income differentials are widening.

what you say holds  truth and that's why banks use   **Fractional**\-**reserve banking**  but in our times it has been
debunked  [
The 2.8 trillion the OP posted is  QE ( *quantitative easing* ) and has nothing to do with what you describe. QE is
essentially a bailout for private sector securities and public sector securities and consists of
Corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP)
Public sector purchase programme (PSPP)
Asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP)
Covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3)
Quantitative easing (QE), also known as large-scale  asset purchases, is an expansionary monetary policy whereby a central  bank buys predetermined amounts of **government bonds** or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase **liquidity**
Why does the ECB has to step in and buy all these? because they are garbage and no one wants to buy them!
Sorry no QE for the middle class or the low wage workers...no bailouts for them
Although ECB has been more conservative compared to their american counterpart the FED the numbers just
show failed policies because although there is productivity increase in the last decade  wages not only can't even
keep up with inflation but in many countries they have been decimated making living condition unbearable.

selling doesn't mean converting to fiat(exiting the space),
do you think OGs didn't sell the top to rebuy at the lows?
Like that davincij15 guy who sold at the top last december.
If you sold at 18k and rebought at 3k now this means you just 6X your BTC position
Just holding doesn't increase my positions and i don't care about fiat either.
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:14:38
sounds like more hopium for the masses
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:43:34
I used those numbers as davincij15 and others still believe btc will go lower than 3k and havent bought back yet btc but the point is to increase your holdings so selling at 15k and buying back at 6k or 8k would greatly increasing your holdings instead of just riding the wave.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:09:23
you never sold no amount since 2012? my hats off to you then...
How did you overcome the greed to sell in the previous bullruns? or the one last december?

only buy physical gold or silver, the banks will try to sell you the paper version that you can redeem but
if gold skyrockets  they will only give you some fiat instead which in a major collapse will be worthless.
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:02:54
i will give you the only numbers that have actual meaning in an average persons daily life where i live
Minimum wage is back at 2003 level when everything has at least 3x in prices, from gas, food, electricity,  taxes are
  more higher than ever, if you add 3% yearly inflation than your savings  have also lost at least 30% (bank interest is 
lower than inflation and since 2010 near 0) , austerity is real for many years now.

it will launch in 2019 , they just have to figure which month and day...
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:47:38
Another delay for launch , this time with no specific date, this raises some questions about how actually they are running this project because before publicly announcing their exchange and previous launch dates they were supposed to have done their homework on regulatory requirements and approval time frames. Making bold announcements and finding excuses every month shows an amateurish approach from a company that is thought to be the leaders of the industry.

@_date: 2019-01-05 08:52:52
Don't stick to these numbers, as you said selling at 15k or 12k and buying back lower at 6-7k would be great , what matters is increasing your holdings , of course there are people who just want to hold which is fine too.

it would be irrational to keep climbing forever, those who will fomo in the end of the bullrun are not experienced in big pullbacks or bear markets, they might never have invested in anything, past data indicates a correction will always happen but the experienced holders know when to sell and accumulate more, or maybe i am totally wrong.

world economies are going into recession which means bankruptcies, less jobs and people going into survival mode, i am not convinced they will buy crypto instead of food or paying their bills, maybe high net worth individuals will  hedge into crypto if fiat currencies become too unstable and volatile. 2016 and 2017 were good years for the crypto market because VCs and funds had a ton of cheap capital in their pockets to play with.I don't know what will happen i am just speculating but would like to hear other reasons why the space could see a big inflow of capital.

have you ever thought of NOT repaying your loan? Here in my country people stopped paying their loans

if you don't own anything that can be confiscated then what can you lose?

When high demand returns for cryptos it will be more than the sell pressure of the current wave of holders, this is how it has worked in each cycle so far and market cap stays bigger than the previous cycle.This is how I understand it but I could be wrong also.
