You smoke crack, you can't snort it.

I'm glad I now know every time someone famous mentions Bitcoin. It's very important.

If $28 is "everything" to someone, maybe they shouldn't be spending it on crypto.

Ahh, that makes more sense.

I never knew Esquire was a Russian based publication; used to have a subscription to their magazine. Sounds like an issue they would write about.

I've never been to South America so I can't say for sure. However I'm almost certain you'd be fine in Mexico. I have family that have lived in Mexico all their lives and they are very white too!

It's a joke.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:41:58
Uh sure buddy. I've been to Mexico too. I guess there are no poor people at all. That was just in my imagination.

Change scares most people.

Lol, that's the downside to Mexico? I don't mean burst your bubble but the vast majority of the world does not treat dogs (or pets for that matter) nearly as well as people in the US. Most dogs in third world countries are not kept indoors, they are tied up outside or kept in cages. Keeping pets is just a part of American culture that is different than much of the world. And there is a lot worse things about MX than how they treat their dogs. Poverty, violence, drugs, etc. It's still a beautiful country and I love visiting but the country is definitely struggling.

You seem like a really pleasant person.

A lot of the very small countries in Europe resort to sketchier stuff like this to make up for their lack of population.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:55:13
That's actually a great way to put it. They're not meaningfully abusing the animals, they just don't view them as pets the same way Americans do.

Wow, he was pathetic.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:46:41
Yep.. Glad I at least sold a good portion of my position back when it crashed to around 9k.

And cocaine, heroin, mdma, research chemicals, firearms, stolen credit card numbers, etc.

You shouldn't take advantage of your grandmother's increasing senility and advancing age.

Looks kinda nasty.
