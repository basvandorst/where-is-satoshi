A wise man once said:  
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services."

Because it IS the closest thing we have to a central bank.  Apparently their PR team has done a great job of obscuring the fact that they are, for all intents and purposes, a bank.  There is also nothing legally stopping them from holding fractional reserves.  The only reason they don't is because it would cause backlash.  As soon as it becomes a net positive to do so, I have no doubt that Circle and Coinbase will do this.
I'm sorry, but Coinbase and Circle are, in fact, the enemy.  Centralization is the enemy.  And if the bitcoin community grows beyond its vocal early adopter community, this voice will be drowned out, and we'll live in a world where every bitcoin is attached to an identity by 1-2 degrees of separation, and the money supply (bitcoin IOU supply) will fluctuate at the whims of bitcoin banks.
Satoshi was even lukewarm about the very notion of web wallets - where you still OWNED the keys.  I doubt centralized bitcoin banks who are complying with government banking regulations would be the ideal manifestation of his vision.

This is not about securing your coins.  This is about coinbase wanting a guarantee that a certain amount of their reserves can't be touched, in order to set themselves up to lend those coins and/or store them as fractional reserves.  I think it's time for a healthy run on the bitcoin banks.

Coca-cola did not describe anything when it was registered.  It's a BRAND.  "Bitcoin" is the same as "e-mail".  Even if someone registered "e-mail" before the patent office knew what it was, it would not be enforceable as soon as they decided it was part of common vernacular (or as they would call it, a "term of art").      
Please give me a scenario under which the "bitcoin" trademark would be enforceable.  In fact, if I wanted to, I could make a filing right now to petition the USPTO to revoke that mark, and I'm certain that it would be sustained.   Maybe I should crowd fund for the cost of this.
They registered it before the "bitcoin foundation" and "bitcoin investment trust" existed.. should be able to sue for infringement, right?

Right, but it's good to keep in mind that bitcoin, given it's inherent decentralized nature, has an inherent 'political' intent - a rejection of managed economies.

Not necessarily the best analogy, because unlike "e-mail" or "bitcoin", the word Xerox was not a descriptive term prior to being registered as a trademark, and didn't mean anything to anyone prior to this.  If we use an example of the words "e-mail" "e-commerce", these trademarks may have slid under the radar and been granted registration because the attorneys at the patent and trademark office didn't know that they were in fact "terms of art", or generic terms known within a certain industry.  Once they realize this, the prior registrations are deemed unenforceable, and anyone can actually petition for their removal from the register.   The same applies to bitcoin.

Indeed.

I can say with absolute certainty that this trademark is worthless for all practical purposes, aside from resale value to a sucker who has no understanding of IP law.  Even though it was granted registration, it can be demonstrated that the word was a "term of art" (a commonly used term representing a specific technology within an industry) when it was registered, and has since become even more so, and thus is not enforceable.  Just because the examining attorney at the trademark office may be unaware that a term is a "term of art" when they grant you a registration does not mean that the registration is enforceable.  There is significant legal precedent for this with new technologies, particularly during the internet boom.  In the same way that anyone can now use the term "e-commerce" or "e-mail" even if someone previously registered it, anyone can use the term Bitcoin without threat of infringement.  
In fact, I recently filed in the US to register a mark with "bit" as the prefix, not even "bitcoin", and the examining attorney initially refused it because "bit" represents "bitcoin", which they stated is "merely descriptive" of an aspect of our service, and is thus generic term.   If they consider "bit" generic because it references bitcoin, there is no question that the word "bitcoin" itself now considered a generic term and is not enforceable.

Market failure, as defined in economics, occurs when individual rational behavior does not equate to group rational behavior.  This phenomena often cannot be prevented. 
Example:  I'm standing with an army of foot soldiers, who are facing an army approaching on horseback.  If I run the other way, I will escape, as the oncoming horses will be sufficiently slowed by the rest of the men in my army.  However, if everyone reaches this same conclusion and runs, the horses will catch up to everyone and we'll all die.  So the decision to run is the rational choice for everyone individually, but it ends up producing a negative outcome for the group, as you cannot control the actions of others.  
So to relate this example to GHash, the decision for me to run the other way in the example above is analogous to the decision to mine for GHash.  It's rational for me to join GHash on a personal level because of increased profits, however if everyone collectively reaches the same rational conclusion, they will all be worse off.

3)  Does it matter if you operate "outside the system" if all of the major entry points from fiat into bitcoin (coinbase) are linked to an identity, and can be reported to the state?

This has nothing to do with my mark.  This has everything to do with the fact that any examining attorney, including the one who examined my mark, will recognize "bitcoin" as a generic term of art.   They literally google it to find out.  You can see their searches in the documents attached to my trademark application.
Regarding your elaborate example, neither "bitcoin" nor "cryptocurrency" are enforceable, just as neither "dollar" or "currency" are enforceable.

you could look at it that way.  In the case of global warming, you could claim that my individual decision to use things that pollute will result in a negative outcome when done collectively.

I can say Satoshi is Szabo with &gt;99% certainty.  
tl;dr 
- Szabo's bit gold propsal, which he discussed in 2005, is identical to bitcoin from a technical standpoint.  Szabo invented the blockchain idea.  Szabo also asked for help coding it 7 months before bitcoin was launched.  Bitcoin is the implementation of bit gold.
- Szabo knew Hal Finney as far back as 1992.  Finney was trusted by 'Satoshi' as recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, and was the first to start running bitcoin.
- Two independent linquistic analyses identified Szabo as author of the whitepaper.  
- (anecdotal, but noteworthy) Satoshi used the date that Roosevelt signed an executive order banning gold ownership as his birthday.  Szabo has mentioned the significance of this executive order in his blog.

He knew Finney since at least 1993.  I'd venture to guess that Finney at least "knows" that Szabo is Satoshi without "knowing".  He was the first to respond to Satoshi's announcement.  
Also, how was Gavin able to get in touch with Szabo when no one else has been able to for the past few years?  
Another one of his friends from the early 90's, Perry Metzger, spoke at Porcfest last year.

We are not gaining merchant adoption, especially in local stores where we conduct 80-90% of our commerce.  
The problem is that nobody is incentivized to actually solicit new merchants to start accepting bitcoin.  It's a 'chicken-and-egg" problem so to speak.. or what economists would call a 'market failure'.  Incentives need to be introduced.  Payment processing companies are not enough, and are focused too broadly.  We need to build local merchant adoption from the ground up to actually create robust economic activity.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:29:12
Because the government now controls every possible entry point into Bitcoin from US Dollars (exchanges, localbitcoins, atm's, etc.).  They can now ask for access to all of this info from companies like coinbase to "investigate" tax evasion.  In fact, coinbase is already required to report transactions over a certain amount as per Fincen compliance.
@_date: 2014-07-03 03:33:01
How about looking emperically at just about every banking / depository system that has ever existed.  
They all start out as full reserve, then incentivize depositors to keep their deposits sitting in their vaults, then inflate the IOU supply, knowing that they have a certain amount guaranteed in reserves that should mitigate the risk of a bank run while allowing them to lend, invest, and sometimes steal deposits.  
But you're right, Fred Ersham is the kind of guy that really values the core principles of bitcoin, and he'd never do such a thing in order to maximize his bottom line.

@_date: 2014-07-03 03:39:45
Just look at how every banking system began and progressed throughout history.  They all start as full reserve, until they realize that they can play with 90% of deposits with minimal risk of running out of liquidity.  Inscentivizing (or in this case GUARANTEEING) deposits further minimizes this risk, as well as the risk of a potential run.

It just dawned on me that this situation is an example of market failure (as defined in economics).  Miners are all acting in their individual self interest to join GHash.IO, as it is currently the most profitable, however if everyone reaches the same rational conclusion on an individual basis, everyone will end up worse off.
See David Friedman on market failure:

I was heavily down-voted recently for suggesting that coinbase and/or circle will turn into a fractional reserve bank.  This guy seems to agree.  
If you don't like the idea of an expanding bitcoin (IOU) money supply, I'd suggest we start steering people away from bitcoin banks, at least as a means of storing bitcoin.

The only reason why this struggle exists is because of the regulations involved with moving from fiat to bitcoin. Otherwise, "mass market" solutions could easily be built in a decentralized and usable way.  Unfortunately, these regulations exist, and its also much more profitable to act as a redundant middle-man like coinbase.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:38:42
-  While it's possible someone may have stole Szabo's idea, I'd say it's far more likely that Szabo implemented it himself, seeing as he asked for help coding it up 7 months before bitcoin was launched.  Even if by some slim chance someone stole Szabo's idea and launched bitcoin, Szabo should still be recognized a creator of bitcoin - the technology.  
-  Finney and Szabo knew eachother since the early 90's.  Would finney be more likely to help someone who stole Szabo's idea, or Szabo himself?
-  Linguistic analysis is not evidence.  This is all circumstantial, but there are piles of circumstantial evidence.  Its probably enough to classify it as "beyond a reasonable doubt".
