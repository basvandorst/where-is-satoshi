I recommend 48in48  This charity gathers web designers and coders in big cities annually to come together and build 48 websites in 48 hours for nonprofit organizations at no cost to the nonprofits. If you are interested in donating to them I will let them know as I have worked with them and see if they have a address or set one up.

People at are alot more understanding of Bitcoin. In fact, I got into Bitcoin after receiving a btc tip from someone in @_date: 2014-04-16 17:44:33
Very cool but if you are only selling in Bitcoin, how come the prices are shown in u.s. dollars? I know it is probably so people can easily compare to prices on other sites but why not put the bitcoin price right next to the usd price?

The whole thing that got me into bitcoin was a great guy on r/silverbugs btc tipping me. Fast forward a week and a half and Im constantly checking bitcoin charts and putting a portion of my paycheck aside for Bitcoin.

Coinbase won't let me buy more because the .1 BTC i got last week is still processing ):  WHY COINBASE???
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:00:07
I'm pissed at myself for not buying at $270. I kept refreshing to see if it would go lower but minutes later it was back at $300. and then it didn't let me buy. Now i'm stuck with my .1 BTC when i had a chance to good chance to increase it. Rookie mistake 
EDIT: nvm, Coinbase wasn't going to let me buy anymore anyways because my purchase from last week is still processing.

I bought .1 BTC from coinbase earlier this week and it's not going to be added till Wednesday. I'm thinking of getting another .5 but i bet theyre gonna pull the "sorry High risk LOL" crap on me.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:40:49
Thanks good sir!

This makes me think about that Norwegian man who bought 5k BTC for $27 total and sold at $200 a few weeks ago to make $880,000 (still an amazing profit) but He must be a bit regretful that he didn't wait because he would have made 3 times that.

While we're talking about coinbase, i have a question to experienced customers. Is it possible to get instant transactions of BTC on coinbase? I bought .1 btc and then .2 more btc after my .1 was added. I hate having to wait more than a week for the btc to get added to my account and the fact that it doesn't let me buy more while a previous transaction is pending. 
I know there's level one and two for customers but i can't find what the requirements are to get to level 2
