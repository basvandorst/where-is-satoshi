I just sent some from my Ledger to a Binance wallet and got confirmed just fine.

I read a silly article on some awful site yesterday about why this year's Bluetooth headphones won't give you cancer like cell phones do.

I like gambling and I don't see the point in playing house odds anymore.
Even the craps table isn't nearly as much fun as watching GDAX with everyone else in this zeitgeist, together over and over and over.
You can play tennis against a wall anytime you want but this chance to play tennis against a goddamned alien might only come once in a lifetime.

I think this is the only "changed my life" story that I actually like.
You didn't just change, you embodied the zeitgeist.
Good for you, man.

That's easy to say but almost impossible to do.
Everyone here is waiting for it to go back down at the moment but there is a very real possibility that it might not.
The only people who are guaranteed to feel better at the end of the day are people who aren't looking to make money, but rather support Bitcoin until it either changes the world or gets killed by the establishment to prove that life is cruel.
If Bitcoin becomes what it wants to become, you won't ever need to "sell."

The percentage rebalancing point is an interesting and wise one that isn't mentioned here very often.
We all talk about dollar cost averaging to mitigate risk and reduce stress but being conservative with enormous gains seems to me equally prudent.

You'll probably want to call them about it, they have phone support now.

Lots of mainstream press means lots of skeptics coming in to get a taste of the hype and lots of casual investors getting spooked by the sheer acceleration.
I wouldn't give it too much more thought than that.

To be fair, they were not happy with the state of the market at the time.
I think a lot of us would be similarly unhappy if everything tanked tomorrow to quite the degree that it did then.

It's not going to help with existing unhappiness, but dollar cost averaging is a pretty good mental defense against this going forward.
Identify a percentage or subset of your weekly or monthly income that you can afford to throw away on a regular basis, and commit to it—no more, no less.
Then whatever happens is a result of your long-term commitment rather than any nerve-wracking heat-of-the-moment decision.
Don't try to optimize, just decide to participate.
