Only if you care about the price this year. Me, I don't care. Not this year, and not next year either. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:44:52
Hah everything I buy turns to crap. I've been buying all through the 8000s, down to the 7000s, and now through the 6000s. I don't care about this year's prices because they're irrelevant. When it's breaking new all time highs, it won't matter that I couldn't time the bottom to save my life this year.
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:36:49
I think it will turn out that way. Perspective from the top will be alright. Across this year, seeing every filled order just diving...well, that's just the price we gotta pay.
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:40:55
Your final sentence is very important context. At present we are by no means in a bull run.

But then again, anyone quoting Warren Buffet is surely someone who has looked for help from Warren Buffet. Someone who is not-so-smart as an investor.

Ah I see. I guess that's just the fee to get my BTC out of my backwater exchange (not an American lol). Also, it might show, but I'm new at this. I have never bought anything in BTC. If the transaction fee is really only a few cents then the future looks good.

"How many times do we see a 10% gain in alts? At least once or twice a week."
How many times do you have the timing to buy the bottom and sell the top? I'm not being sarcastic at all. You will lose money - as much money as you try to use - if you believe you can time the market. And rolling 69 perfect 10% trades in a row? That's delusional. The only people who would say that it's possible are brokers. Make one loss big enough and you're done. That's not even taking your trading costs into consideration. Fees and slippage eat into your profits. You can be your exchange's best friend, or you can be profitable. Profitability comes from trading less rather than more though.

Craig Wright is a fraud. It's ridiculous that at this point, it even needs to be said. Someone ought to be shadowing Craig Wright like one of those plague nuns, with a bell shouting "Fraud"  at his every move.

To compare the loss Bob was dealing with here to losing some money speculating in new markets, is to cynically diminish true grief.

Sell to me then. I'll offer you $100/BTC for your dead crypto. This is an incredibly generous offer, given we're talking about a dead currency here that has absolutely no value at all. Please reply urgently as this is a totally serious offer that I will pay in cash at your convenience.

So's real estate by that metric. And rare coins. And anything else with value derived from its later-on scarcity and desirability.

So few people were using Bitcoin back then. If you're looking for full Windows 7 keys though, your probably onto something.

@_date: 2019-12-17 16:11:04
Value is only what someone's willing to pay for something. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. Not does anything else. Value is the imaginary imputation of worth to an object by a market. Bitcoin was worthless at its conception. At the moment no one would let a Bitcoin go for less than $6700 US dollars. Why is that? What value does Bitcoin have? None, beyond what the lowest offer and the highest bidder imagines it has.
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:59:39
That's the thing yeah. BTC may well be a popular speculative instrument these days, and it may well increase in popularity. But it really is unique in that if offers you the ability and the right to bank for yourself. That ability can't be taken or overridden by anyone. Not a higher authority, not a nation, not a king. Your BTC, if you have the private keys to it, is yours and yours alone.
@_date: 2019-12-17 10:27:06
Peak FOMO while the price has been going down for th last six months? Which Bitcoin are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:37:37
Why would you hold when you can sell out, buy more at the bottom, and win even harder? 
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:53:25
That does it, I'm panicking in, full FOMO. Just called my bank to secure a mortgage.

That's a candle - a charting system across a given time frame. If you look at shorter timeframes like 1 minute or less, the line will look more jagged.

Been buying since USD$8k. Never seen a good time in my life. Never had a crypto gain. Still buying today for a few reasons.  
First is that like most people, I'm a speculator not a technical analyst. I can't see a bottom any better than you can see tomorrow's lotto numbers.  
Second is that when the good times come back, more than 9/10 people are gonna regret not getting into crypto. Statistically, only 1/10 people even in developed nations have any crypto. If you can't see the price potential just based on that, I don't know how to help you. The good times, when they come back, are gonna come back in a massive way.

Wow damn, there's an exchange that accepts PayPal!?
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:36:31
This is among bitcoin's biggest problems. Why would you ever sell when it only goes up? Why would anyone ever buy anything in bitcoin when it's only going to be cheaper in the future?
Bitcoin was designed as a currency but it's traded and held like a commodity. The way bitcoin users think of bitcoin is keeping bitcoin from becoming viable.

@_date: 2018-07-17 11:39:52
I agree. It's nonsense to suggest that people need an intimate understanding of the system. The system just needs to work. That said, BTC is a ways off mainstream not only due to the mainstream not understanding it. Ask some normie in the street where to buy a bitcoin, or what to put the bitcoin in when he's got it. It's not the system itself, but the basic ways to use that system that people don't even know. Look at PayPal. I think someone with no experience using PayPal could be up and running in an hour or two. Try going from zero to your first transaction with bitcoin. Most exchanges take days or weeks to approve a new account. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:28:56
