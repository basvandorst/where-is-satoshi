We're working for a logo to advertise the acceptance, but we are up and running with BitCoin now at SnG Vapor.
Really for merchants it's a no-brainer, especially int his industry.  Rates are far lower than CC, even through a 3rd party like we use (BitPay.com).  Also, the elimination of charge-backs has allowed us to open all of our international shipping options up so that we no longer fear those orders to common CC fraud countries.

Yes, it really has.  Also, it's a lot bigger issue with the e-cig industry as our merchant accounts are considered high-risk anyway.  Chargebacks from fraudulent purchases sent to non-AVS countries are ahuge issue to us as not only are we out the money on the order, but CC processors can, will, and have dropped companies for an excess of chargebacks, leaving them with no way to take payment online.

Freaking spectacular.  Nothing makes me more afraid than an order for like 6 naturals to a country with no AVS system....
This eliminates the whole issue of fraud, as once the transactions hows approved, it's mine, and I can ship with a bit more peace of mind.

SnG Vapor ( also accepts BTC for payment, for any interested.  It's integrated into our cart and checks out just like a credit card.  We fully support the BTC concept, and would love to see more folks using it on our site.
