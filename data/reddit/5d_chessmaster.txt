You know how this thread is about mining rigs? Bitcoin lives on all those mining rigs. It's as simple as that. 
Everyone mining has a copy of the block chain, and in order to steal a Bitcoin you have to hack all the miners at the same time.
What gives it value is the fact that there will only ever be 21 million, a lot of those are lost, and people who have the rest don't want to sell. 
That's Bitcoin.

Gold is used in electronics, doesn't have anything to do with being pretty. Gold is highly conductive.

The beauty of the blockchain is everyone can have their own copy (called a node) in order to look and make sure their coins are there.
Anything that had a copy of the blockchain like a miner or a full wallet is a node. Some wallets are light nodes meaning they do not contain a copy of the entire blockchain. They don't really need it.
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:38:11
Depends on if you are Chinese or not. Or North Korean.

No, but if there are really only 11 to 16 million bitcoins possible then there will be a lot of millionaires that own zero bitcoins.

What percentage of that was just Keith Richards by himself?
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:09:37
I agree with you.
Nations could replace their worthless paper fiat with a crypto that can actually hold value. People would mine which would set up the network. It could all be regulated idc if they regulate a crypto of their own making.
I just think of it like USD 2.0
We already have almost all our money in a digital form anyway.

Yes, within the next 15 minutes.
Might also be within the next 15 years though.
Like I said spend half your cash now so you are in and you can start to lose the FOMO. At that point you can watch the market for a few days and plot your next move.
