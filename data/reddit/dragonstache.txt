Can you explain what you mean by that? Please forgive me as I’m trying to understand and am still new. 
Downgrade of security - because no replay protection? Or some other reason?
Rejected by the nodes - I thought most nodes agreed with it. What do you mean by this specifically. 
That say what bitcoin is - again can you please elaborate. 
Thank you in advance. I apologize for knowing more but I haven’t been here long and it’s a steep learning curve.

Here’s my understanding: each bitcoin is a string of transactions that compromises its history. Every additional transaction must follow the rules of the system in order to proceed. A fork is when those rules change for whatever reason. At the time of the fork, there will be coins that are in the old system. They can either proceed according to the new system, old system, or both.* BTC will be when that string of transaction history occurs according to the old rules, b2x will be when it occurs according to the new rules.  Because you had coins in the old system, you now how coins in both new chains, which are effectively different currencies at this point. 
The rules that are being changed at this fork have to do with increasing the efficiency of the transactions so that lower fees can be charged for each one. However, people don’t like t because it decentralizes the process in some way I don’t understand. 
*at this point they are vulnerable to what’s called replay hacking, where basically you exercise a transaction on the new system and the data for your coins becomes available and are exercised on the old system without your knowledge. 
Please proceed to flame me for my wrongness, oh hive mind!

Can someone help me understand something. Is the idea is for bitcoin to be a genuine currency, like some that we can use to conduct business, get a haircut, buy a house, etc? If that’s the case, then how is all of this price volatility a good thing? If I buy my haircut for 142 bits*, how am I supposed to know if it’s a fair price when later tonight my beer at the bar might be 200 bits depending on the price change?
*someone tell me if I’m doing the bitcoin—&gt;bit conversion right if it’s a $40 haircut at $7000/coin

I actually don’t understand why there is so much controversy about updating with segwit 2 x. I just got into bitcoin and I like the idea but the fees seem ridiculous! How is it sustainable with those kinds of fees? My understanding is that segwit2x will decrease fees. Why don’t people like it? Feel free to point me in the direction of a resource. I want to learn.

Overall after the announcement of the futures market yesterday most response at least on this reddit was negative. Would you expect the existence of a futures market to stabilize the price somewhat?

Is this how GDAX works as well?

Can someone answer please I am wondering the same thing?

What happens to those coins now? Like if they are never found?

Interesting. Thanks for explaining. What implication does that have for the long term viability of bitcoin? Since there is a fixed quantity (21 mil) and some portion must be lost every year (carelessness, floods, fires, etc) would there ever be a future where we were all trading astronomical prices for one bitcoin? Additionally, I always hear the most secure method of store bitcoin is through paper keys. However, isn’t this a bit like hiding money under your bed? If your house burns down - poof it’s gone? Finally, (just one last question) can you help explain (or can you point me in the direction of where I might figure out) what happens if say, someone now, or ten years down the line recovered their bitcoin keys. On a technical level, what would have to happen with all of the forks and other changes that have occurred. (I’m imaging a future movie where a child macaulay culkin recovers his grandfathers baseball trading card and in it finds a paper key worth like 1k in coins anyone?). Since there would be a history of fewer transactions on those coins, would they be smaller blocks? (not sure if I’m asking  this right, still trying to wrap my head around the details of blockchain)

Hey sorry but I’m just not quite understanding, can you help me a little more? I thought there would only ever be 21 million coins. Let’s say 1 million are lost through misplaced paper wallets. That means there’s only effectively 20 million. But you’re saying the value isn’t I.e. the global demand for coin is the same regardless so everyone else’s coins are “worth” more? Am I understanding correctly?
