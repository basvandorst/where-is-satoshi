If bitcoin has a snowball's chance in hell at becoming a ubiquitous currency, we'll need a simple solution that every idiot can use. 
  
Standalone Linux machines are great, but they only make bitcoin more intimidating to folks who don't know about information security. 
 And let's be real, almost everyone who is currently sitting on btc is a speculator; the only way to see your investment pay off is to build popular appeal. And that means not scaring off the non-technical crowd. Which is almost everyone. 
  So as much as the purists hate coinbase, their vault feature may be the way of the new world. Yeah, you have to trust them, but if you do, the security features are decent.   And it's the current best hope of seeing btc get popular traction.

We'll see how it all plays out. Something will definitely emerge as the clear winner, and probably soon. It'll be an interesting couple years. Good luck to you

I hear ya. I've been in the game for a long time, and I got great returns from this whole thing, so I can't ever really complain.  I was completely undeterred by the gox situation, but the current issue has exposed a weakness that I never foresaw. I hope I'm wrong, because I love the ideology behind Bitcoin, but the current framework strikes me as too easily meddled with -  regardless of who wins the current debate.

This was the only reason I considered not selling.  I think the halving isn't fully priced in and that the value will temporarily go up when the inflation rate drops. 
  But in spite of that, I did sell.  I sold because I realized that I'd lost faith in the principles that underpin Bitcoin.  If a minor internal conflict between a few people can threaten the integrity of a currency, then it just isn't strong enough to weather the big threats that lurk in the world.  Furthermore, it exposes the fact that the promise of a truly decentralized currency was a lie. 
 Currencies need trust, and I no longer trust the people steering the ship.  Moreover, I hate the fact that I would have to trust anyone at all. 
  
  There is plenty of room for a future iteration of Bitcoin to work, but the framework has to be solidly built in advance with the lessons learned from this and other failures. Once we get the formula right, it should be a fire and forget protocol to keep it safe from those who may be corrupted by power.

You mean $500?

When the $1000 coin splits into two equally supported coins, they're gonna be about $500 each if no one sells.

Nah. The newcomers got scared off when they lost all their money. They may still be subscribed, but their wallets are firmly closed for awhile
