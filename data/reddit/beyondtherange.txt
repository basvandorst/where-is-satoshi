"To be honest I've been very disappointed with merchants and I think we should be a little bit more vocal about this."
We are still in boot phase and you have to give some slack.  My business started accepting Bitcoin before the Bitpay era and we took risks holding it.   Granted that risk has be rewarded over the last couple of years, but as "deep merchants" of the community (spend never sell) it does make you cautious.  Perhaps you would like to offer a service that accepts a discount for Bitcoin?

I have said it once and I will say it again.  Scaling Bitcoin will be the ultimate test of OSS.  If you have any knowledge of database fundamentals and read Satoshi's paper, it becomes immediately apperent that there will be no magic bullet or trivial solution.

I find it strange that people think that because Bitcoin can be used on the darkwebs that it somehow reduces its legitimacy.
In fact, I think it enhances its legitimacy.  Bitcoin can facilitate trades in markets that are essentially untouchable for other mediums of exchange.

It's a triple entry ledger where the 3rd entry is performed by distributed consensus and validates the first 2 entries (debit/credit).
Satoshi's Data Laws (Apology to Assimov &amp; Satoshi)
1) Anyone can add an entry to the ledger (transaction) without censorship.
2) An entry is valid only after the network has reached consensus by validating that the entry is logically consistent (block). (Debit = Credit and ownership)
3) Corruption of consensus (51% attack) leads to forks and negates Laws 1 &amp; 2.

IME, it's more about the computing aspect that confuses them, not the money.  People understand barter  (trade without a medium of exchange) and will grasp that bitcoin can be used in trades.
The computing part is hard because a vast majority tactically understand that "unique" in the digital world is rare/hard.  
Copy, paste,  torrent,  burn, rip etc... They understand this.
Sign, hash, probability etc... This is the educational leap they must take.

Eventual consistency is the exact problem that a proper implementation of set logic would solve.  There is never an intermediate stage where the logic is a lie (false).  These problems were solved in 1969 by Codd yet I see it again and again by programmers who think they have a "better way".  I get paid good money to fix this shit up all the time.

Over 1 TPS for a distributed-replicated-trustless-high availability database using commodity hardware is fucking unbelievable. 
A consensus based database constraint is the first of its type and I seriously have not found anything in the literature on R-Algebra from anyone including Codd, Date or Stonebraker that even postulates such a creation.
As a DBA (modeller and implementer for 25 year) I am still in awe of Satoshi's breakthrough.  
EDIT: To clear things up due to some confusion of terms and assumptions:
In my reading of the paper and his other posts, Satoshi was not thinking about Relational Algebra or Database constraints when the idea of "proof of work" popped into his head to validate the blockchain.
The [data model]* that underpins the blockchain can be very easily modelled in R-theory and implemented trivially in any RDBMS.
There is nothing spectacular about the structure or design of it.
The key (excuse the database pun) to the blockchain is the validation of the structure as a whole. 
A traditionally database constraint is the sum of all data constraints for every row, column and table. In essence the database must ALWAYS be in a true state.  
The external validity of the data element is not considered. 
Consider a FirstName database field with values 'Fred' or 'Polka dots axels'. They both maintain the database constraint but one is utter bullshit.
Satoshi's "proof of work" constraint allows us to determine what is true and externally valid via consent and not decree. 
Truthiness by mob rule.
[data model]* 
In this instance to mean "user data model". There are only 3 "data models": Relational, Network, Hierarchy

@_date: 2015-02-03 20:51:10
I am yet to see any BTC related exchange do volume that puts any of the modern RDBMS under strain.  Splitting the database into 2 for reads and writes is insane and would be more resource consuming that a single database with transaction locking.  Any DBA worth his wage would have balance management embedded into the DBMS and not rely on crappy non-set aware middleware.
@_date: 2015-02-14 05:32:25
I did not compare it to RDBMS.  I talked about the blockchain design in R-Theory and the constraint management  of "proof of work".
