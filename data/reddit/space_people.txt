I would suggest to invest the majority of it into bitcoins. If you want to diversify, you can look at all the altcoins out there.
Also, I strongly suggest to take a look at Invictus Innovation. They are a DAC (Decentralized Autonomous Companies) selling different types of shares. You can google Protoshares (PTS), Angelshares (ANG), and Bitshares (BTS) if you want to learn more about their different types of shares. Also take a look at the products they are developing, they seems very promising !
Keep in mind that crypto-currency are very volatile. Anything can happen and no one can predict the future. 
Welcome aboard !

Correct me if I am wrong, but there are a lot of cryptocurrencies out there that operate independently of the bitcoin blockchain. There is no certainty that the bitcoin blockchain will be the one succeeding. There are many alternatives out there.

When people uses the term "Bitcoin 2.0" I believe it is more of a metaphor than the real thing. Maybe the term "Currencies 2.0" could be more appropriate, but anyway ...
The Idea behind the term Bitcoin 2.0, for me, is to describe any application built parallel or on top of the Bitcoin protocol expending the possibilities. We could think of smart contracts, decentralized exchange, decentralized voting, decentralized market place, etc. 
Like Facebook is not "the web 2.0" since it is not a newer version of the Internet. It is still an app making the Internet more valuable en enjoyable for the users, and we can legitimately say that Facebook is part of the Web 2.0.
I think arguing on semantic is not really important. Everyone gets that Bitcoin 2.0 does not mean "the version 2.0 of Bitcoin" it mean "all the possibilities and apps pushing the boundaries of Bitcoin, using this technology".

Exactly ! The fact Bitcoin is hard to get illustrate that the current baking system is flawed not that Bitcoin is. Transferring wealth between two individuals that are far away or in different countries is really hard right now. Once you get into the "cryptocurrency ecosystem" you'll find that it is incredibly easy to send money to anyone cheaply and efficiently.

Peertracks might be the solution to that problem !

Well, first of all I don't think that the price have reached a plateau yet. The price of bitcoins has gone crazy all week (especially on monday) and 1 week ago is not that far away in time ! The price has been stable only for 1-2 days, and the last two days were Saturday and Sunday, days where the banks are closed and were it is harder to make money transfers.
Furthermore, this week there were some huge announcement from companies like Subway, Virgin Galactic, Newegg, cheapair, etc. And this gives a lot of attention to bitcoin. Since it takes few business days to be able to purchase bitcoins (add to that the time for a completely new inverter to understand the basics and be confident enough to make a purchase). I think that in the next few weeks, we will witness big fluctuation of the price of a bitcoin (up and down).


I think that people do not expect to get rich in few days. Investor realize the volatility of emerging technologies such as bitcoin. They know the risk they take, they know the price can skyrocket to the moon, or maybe go down to zero. 
One of the main misconception is that we, bitcoiners, are used to look at the price MANY times a day (and the price moves so quickly !). Our perception of time is very biased. One week can seem like an enormous amount of time, but is is not. Remember that one week ago the price of 1 bitcoin was around 450 USD. Right now, the price is around 800$. So having more that 75% increase in one week is HUGE. Remember, if you want to invest money at the bank, and they offer you 75% increase a year (and they will never do) THIS WOULD BE FUCKING CRAZY. 75% a year is considered by everyone an AWESOME investment, so 75% or event 10% a week is absolutely fantastic !

Localbitcoins has it's own wallet system. I don't think that they will allow you to sell more of BTC that you have in your wallet on their website.

I like the idea of encrypting with 7zip. But do you know how secure a password protected 7zip file is ?
