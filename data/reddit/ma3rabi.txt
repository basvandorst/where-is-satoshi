To be brutally honest with you, i haven't bothered looking in mining. Mainly because my PC isn't powerfull enough and i don't want to buy a mining rig. I rather just put my money on bitcoin and wait for it to double itself. I don't know shit about mining, only how it works and what it has to do with crypto.

This is the thing. My friends were having a discussing about the price drop a while after it happend. They are still kind of iffy about the whole crypto currencies. 
Them: "So you lost some money didn't you?"
Me: "Nope."
T: "How do you mean, didn't it drop?"
M: "It did, but i bought at 8k. It only dropped to 12k. I still have some good profit. Either way, it will clim again you guys should probebly invest now."
T: "No man, i'm waiting for the BIG crash. This is all a bubble. I read it somewhere online. It will crash really hard one day and then i'm gonna buy with everything i got."
M: "Okay man."

You know why i don't think it will crash like that. Too many people are interested in it, too many people are investing in it and more people are joining in every single day. 
Quick disclaimer, i'm FAR from an economist or anything in that line. I only try to think straight with my normal brain. If bitcoins gains more popularity and more investments EVERY day, isn't the market growing?
Sure, it might crash. There are thousands of ways how it could crash and how severely it could crash. Even then, i'm not worried. People will pick it up and it's value will go up.

These i find the worse. They know almost to nothing about crypto, yet they make bold statements like these.

There is of course a possibility that can happen. It's not 10%, if it was 10% most people wouldn't have invested. It's such a low percentage that i don't find it my attention worth it. But it is there, it could really crash one day. Highly doubt it.

Something in the line to 19k &gt; 190 dollars.

Man wish i started at 120$. I knew about bitcoin back then, i was even mining some alt coins. I lost intrest sadly and just got back at it a couple months ago. Either way, i'm definitely not too late. Keep hodling my brother.

Yes, for me atleast it does. I just put the amount i want to withdraw and coinbase will put it on my bank account the same day or a day later.

Put it on a hard drive wallet to be most save. If not, download a desktop wallet and be sure to make a backup. Again, MAKE A BACKUP. Encrypt the wallet with a password and you are decently save. Watch out on the net with telling that you have bitcoin.

Spend all my bitcoin to life forever, totally worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:10:07
I know this! I sold bitcoins in the past numerous of times, it just worries me that uninformed people are saying the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:18:39
This. All people around me know i've invested in bitcoins the last years and made some good money. So now they all come to me and ask for advice. First thing they always say is how they gonna spend a small amount. 10 euro's, 20, 100. Depending on the person and how much he can afford to risk. I always tell them to start small. That i started with 10 euro's and when i saw it makes money and HOW it works i started investing more and more. Got a load of friends in bitcoin this way and they always coming back to me for advise.

I understand what you are saying but that isn't what my boss his brother and friend were trying to say.
They basically said: If you buy bitcoin you lost your money. You can never sell it again as nobody is buying. You got scammed and "The bitcoin owner" won more money.

Sounds like everybody who got in bitcoin when it hit 16k
