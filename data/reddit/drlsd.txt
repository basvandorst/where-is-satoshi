Yes, we're all connected via the internet. But we still have no idea of what's going on in China or Korea because we don't understand a word.

Yeah, I too think that just increasing the block size does not work.
Maybe the solution will be combined, layered approach. Bitcoin with moderate block size increases that follows technology improvements in bandwidth and memory with several layers of lightning on top (e.g., one layer on a country-level, another on state- and city-levels).
I just can't bear all this 'hey, we fixed it. if you don't use SW that's your problem because if everyone was using it EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE' spin around here any more.

Yes, which is why I'd greatly appreciate a statement by Core about when and how much they will increase the block size to make lightning channels feasible.
Lightning is nice, yeah, but it's unusable because the 3-6tx/s limit also limits the number of lightning channels that can be opened/closed. Even with 1GB blocks that's "only" 6000 channels/second, which doesn't sound like a lot to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:16:16
They are in the sense that they might become necessary intermediaries on whose good-will you have to rely to take part in the Bitcoin network.
Yes, yes, I know, you can still chose to use plain old Bitcoin but let's see how the fee market develops; maybe the reason regular users will be no longer be "permitted" (read: able) to transact on the Bitcoin chain will be indirect via high fees. I'm not saying it's gonna be like that I'm just saying it could happen.

I agree. So instead of 1/2 the fees you theoretically get 1/2.8 the fees. However, how 1/2.8 is significantly less than "roughly half" that I mentioned eludes me.


This is a lot of assumptions. One could argue that if network tx throughput increases the number of tx broadcast to the network and entering the mempool will increase as well due to adoption. But it's hard to estimate.

That's not generally true. At least in Germany the money is the bank's. § 700 BGB states that ownership is transferred to the depositary while the depositor retains power of disposition. I'm not entirely sure about the situation in the US but I expect it to be similar.

Both symptoms are caused by the low tx throughput. It's nice how we all jerk off each other whenever some judge rules bitcoin is or isn't a currency when the hard reality is that in its current form it *can* not function as currency.

Although he certainly would deserve it (it might make sense to wait a couple of more years to see how the scalability-"problem" eventually plays out, tho), I think there are requirements for receiving it. I know for certain that the person has to be at least alive, so with not knowing whether that is true or not, I bet he'd be disqualified. Although a "thank you" note signed using his PGP key would certainly be a truly unique "acceptance ceremony" (and indicate that he's still alive).

No. It's a flaw in the protocol. You use IDs to identify stuff. If you can change them, you might as well label them "random data, do not use for IDing." It needs real fixing (in the protocol), not duct-tape fixing as in "combine *n* other fields to get an unique tx identifier" in software.
Don't get me wrong, mtgox fucked up; I'd just like to treat the protocol flaw separately from that.

You will find transparent encryption using encfs much nicer.
You just put your Dropbox directory in ~/.DropboxRaw/Dropbox and mount that using encfs to ~/Dropbox
You can now access files in ~/Dropbox/ just as if it were your regular Dropbox directory. Each time you put a file into ~/Dropbox/ encfs will put an encrypted file with a mangled name into ~/.DropboxRaw, which is what your Dropbox App will sync. No more need for manual intervention or even unmounting of TrueCrypt volumes.

The panic always originated from China. Doesn't matter if _we_ know/believe/were lead to believe a certain statement shouldn't cause a panic. What matters is what people in China that are moving the marked believe. There might be subtlety in the Chinese statement that is lost when translating it to English. Things run differently there.

No, the protocol is. Satoshi didn't foresee this, thus there is no mechanism in the protocol to avoid it. The market just exploits the protocol. If there is a flaw, it will most likely be causing problems. The lower a pools fee and the better its service, the more users it will attract. It's only natural for people to chose the lowest fee pool. So maybe in a way the market is the problem.

Okay, maybe the word regulation is too much politically charged around here. I was talking about a technical fix, i.e. a set of rules in the bitcoin protocol that disincentives the pooled mining we're seeing right now. I was just calling that regulation, because on an abstract level, that's exactly what it is. Rules that govern the use of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:21:33

I'm currently in the process of setting up a site which shows stats like these. If you need help acquiring a useful machine for the task, let me know, but basically you need: Lots of slowly clocked RAM (cheaper than highly clocked RAM) and a highly clocked CPU with very few cores (cheaper than slowly clocked CPUs with lots of cores). The reason is that today's memory interfaces are built for multicores. Using a single-threaded process, which only uses one core, will never saturate your memory interface. In what might seem counter-intuitive a faster CPU, not faster RAM, will get you faster main memory access.

Do the math. I claim you're always better off buying coin for your money directly. But that's just my opinion. I instantly sold my BFL 60GHash/s piece of crap as soon as I got it on ebay and bought 22BTC with the money. The miner got something like 3-4 BTC out of it. Someone should make a plot or something based on ROI on buying coin vs. buying mining gear over time.

I have to say. As a scientist who is used to hypothesis being backed by facts my alarm lights start flashing whenever I read about solution x being fine while solution y is bad. This most certainly seems the case here. Why should a 2 MB tx take 10+mins to validate? How long does a 1MB tx take? What about SegWit? A single 1.6MB tx validates in &lt;10min, but a 2MB tx takes &gt;10min.
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:34:41

Don't get me wrong. I want segwit but I do not agree with the way it is forced upon us. What's next? "Yeah, we asked some companies and 90% want feature x. Honestly. I promise. Look at this here website." Bullshit.

@_date: 2016-01-20 21:21:03


Honest question: Where do you get the worse case increase in CPU usage?
It is my understanding that in the worst case a 2MB block contains twice the number of transactions than a 1MB block could; thus it should take twice as long to process (in the worst case).
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:45:39

But we're already starting to see ideas to weigh websites by importance. Who's gonna determine the weight and how? Do you see where I'm going with this? Counting like that makes the process even more political!
Plus, previous improvements used signaling as well; throwing it overboard when it doesn't produce the desired result seems very hypocritical to me. I'd rather have no change at all!

@_date: 2016-03-23 18:58:28
I'm no altcoin expert but IMO Ethereum's planned switch from POW to POS is a highly interesting experiment.
It will be nice to see how voting using POS will turn out vs. voting by hashpower (which is highly antidemocratical IMO -- not saying that POS is any better tho).
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:50:46
I agree with you. But don't you fear the economy of scale in combination with significant variations in power cost depending on country will come crushing down on home miners no matter the algorithm?
It seems to work out for Ethereum now, but IMO the only reason there's no concentration of mining power in Ethereum is because all the profit is (at least currently) in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:28:37
I don't care about short-term price, so... let the fork happen and let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:39:21
Network = miners plus users. 
You say, they don't care about the rest of the network, which, minus miners is users. Or is it?
There is a way to measure miner consensus. How do you measure user consensus, allowing you to reason the user voice is unanimous? I find, lacking a technical way to quantify user consensus we should be careful with such unfounded statements.
What is your opinion on economic involvement, e.g. coin, voting?

@_date: 2017-03-29 11:25:15
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:11:45
Yeah, it should make clear to everyone that the majority is neither pro-Core or pro-BU. The majority wants SegWit but nevertheless big-blockers outnumber small-blockers.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:12:16
I'm a bitcoin user and am not currently in favour of Core or BU, because I haven't spent enough time thinking about these issues MYSELF. I do not want to follow the herd blindly. But let me say this: bundling a set of features into one BIP and forcing miners to either accept or reject all of the ideas in it makes absolutely no sense from a technical perspective. Being against it does not imply being against every feature. Using it as a pretence to mark them as stupid for wanting to hurt scalability makes no sense. Miners are not "they, the evil." They do not have a moral dimension. They are profit-optimising economic agents. Saying they are out to hurt bitcoin makes no sense in my opinion. I just think the objectives of miners and users do not always naturally align. Part of the root of the problem is the categorisation of each side of "us" vs. "them," which is not helping the issue at all. There must be compromise from both sides. Otherwise we end up with two chains, one of which lacks users (because they disagree with the rules imposed by miners) and the other which has almost not miners. This will hurt adoption gravely, because it will take time for the market to find equilibrium for both chains. The solution that should be looked into is defining a voting system that includes both miner and user voices -- which seems next to impossible :-)
@_date: 2016-01-21 06:02:31
Yeah. I find that hard to believe either. These claims all just seem  to be falling from the sky with no real evidence whatsoever. And this when providing technical support is trivial to get by benchmarking.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:28:09
Do you not consider block signaling a way to measure miner consensus?
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:37:17
It's pretty obvious -- d'uh! Your tx is spam. Next!
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:24:50

@_date: 2017-08-01 08:21:44
You make it sound like nodes keep miners in check when in reality it is trivial for deep-pocketed miners to set up an overwhelming amount of nodes to support their agenda. Therefore, using nodes to measure support makes no sense in practise IMO. But I'm open to being convinced otherwise.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:23:45
That's one definition of "support."
Other, equally valid definitions:
- hash power
- value transfered via the chain over some time 
- number of active users
- etc.
Regarding node software: it's gonna be exciting. Core supporters crashing bu/abc/btc1 nodes; cash guys congesting sw-chain. Gonna be a rough ride; I hope in the end we end up with multiple robust solutions. Competition has always been a motor to innovation. I like what Core has delivered up to now and I considder myself a Core-supporter, but some of the flock really could go a little more easy on the anything not Core is gonna kill bitcoin and Jihan is the lovechild of Hitler and Satan dogma.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:15:14
I agree wholeheartedly with your first point. Miners are economic actors, they'll always try to maximise profits. It would be nice if they acted morally, but this is more or less equal to suicide because the competition would eat them.
I get the frustration portrayed in the second point and I agree with your reasoning. I can't see SW2X offering anything of value. We already have XBT and BCC, which offer different approaches to the scaling problem; a hybrid doesn't seem that innovate. But who are we to tell them they can't have SW2X because they mine BCC? :-)
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:15:18
Sounds interesting. Do you have any more pointers to what might be the problem with initial node sync? Maybe someone already profiled the process?

There'll be another fork for sure. Problem is, this time it's not going to be 5% of the hash power but almost all of it - at least if miners do not back out of the agreement.

Problem is that almost noone seems to be able to infer this on his own?!
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:17:32

I found the bitnodes project. But they do appear to include all reachable nodes (fully validating nodes plus other, e.g., SPV, nodes). Is that correct?
Would it be possible do get a snapshot of fully validating nodes using the bitnodes script, requesting some random block from each of the found nodes, and only count those nodes that serve the block?
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:51:07
Well, that was disturbing. I have to admit that Bob in slide 19 at around 12 minutes in looks a lot like some financial institution acting as a third party necessary to transfer my funds.
We have to see how this plays out. But here's one possible scenario (and no, I'm not saying this will happen but at the same time I'm happy to have BCH as alternative if something goes south): Regular users won't be able to transact one the Bitcoin chain because they cannot compete with fees from LN node operators; after all, the 1 MB block space will be highly contented for if adoption picks up. LN node operators collude to milk customers for settling their TX (certainly that is something not entirely improbable). Rationale: "Hey Joe Sixpack, I have to comply with state-issued regulation to participate in the legacy banking system... errr... I mean, I'm running all this expensive hardware and employing smart nerds to run the LN node, sure you'll understand I have to charge you a 2% tx fee--after all, it's what the competing LN nodes ask for as well."
Hopefully someone will provide some rebuttal to alleviate my fears.

In general you can say that "compute," i.e., your CPU, is never your bottleneck if you look at anything else than LINPACK IF(!) you run "good" code, i.e., code that makes efficient use of your CPU  :-)
In my experience, functional codes hardly use any of the potential of contemporary CPUs. This is even more true for most cryptocurrency code, where programmers, understandably, focus more on security, readability, maintainability, etc. in favour of say, e.g., SIMD vectorization or multi-core parallelism.
To get an idea of what's possible, just look what sipa did with his libsecp256k1 to ECC operation throughput.

I will tell you why I think market cap. can not be used to compare different assets.
Suppose you have $1 million in gold, $1 million in XBT, and $1 million in ETH. Now you dump all your gold, XBT, and ETH. You will hardly move the gold price with your tiny $1 million, so you will get close to $1 million out. You might not move XBT much by selling $1 million, but you'll certainly not get $1 million. Same is true to ETH, although I expect a very large price move by dumping $1 million worth of ETH.
Isn't there some better metric that can be used to compare different assets? Something that involves market depth?

I have one more comment on that.
The network has shown to work at 1MB blocks. I think the true top priority should be to increase TX throughput while maintaining the current block size for as long as possible and the move on to increase the block size (after other transaction-throughput improvements like, e.g., Schnorr, have run their course) under the constraint of keeping the cost of running a full node at such a level that the number of full nodes are sufficient to guarantee a working network.

Yes. That'll drive more users to altcoins and reduce block size even more! /s
While I understand your frustration with the long initial block sync, smaller blocks are not an option. At current block sizes we cannot even use LN in a meaningful way as it would take roughly 60 years to get each individual to open A SINGLE LN channel: 6*10^9 pplz / 3 tx/s / 60 s/m / 60 m/h / 24h/d / 365 d/y
I wonder if there's a solution to this problem I'm not thinking of. Cause these numbers tell me that blocks need to be 8.7 GB if we want one LN channel per hour per person.

In that case you could then look at both:

A quick (and therefore probably flawed) inquisition of the mind says: Yes.
XBT hash power has more or less halved (cf. bitcoin.sipa.be or  thereby reducing the number of blocks from six to almost three per hour; this in turn halves the TX throughput of the network. Commodity scarcity doubled, assuming perceived value of service unchanged -&gt; double the price per unit. Add the psychological effect of "I need my TX in there" and you'll get superlinear increase in fees.
You can expect fees to drop significantly after the next BCH diff. adjustment.

I'm very excited about LN as well and hope that it will improve the overall situation. However, as a natural critic, I'd like to offer some remarks on your list:


Of a tx than has nothing to do with the bitcoin blockchain.


What's to prevent the LN node operators from colluding and asking for a 1% fee on each node? 


Well, someone has to pay the miner's fees. Do you expect LN node operators to do that FOR you out of sheer altruism? Or is it more than likely they will make you pay for their fees (taking some small fraction for themselves in the process, making it more expensive than before for users)
Just saying. Scalability via LN might turn out expensive for us after all.
In theory, the user's fee should go down: lightning tx could cost 1/1000th of a bitcoin tx fee when 1000 lightning tx can be settled by a single bitcoin tx.
But what will happen when blocks become to small for all LN settlements and fees for bitcoin blocks rise? Scalability aside, all LN does in terms of fees is making you pay them to LN node operations instead of miners.

Yeah, the problem is that you cannot mathematically quantify these psychological effects.
I just thought maybe there is a metric that includes uses more variables than 'last execute trade price' x ' total supply' to estimate the 'value' behind some asset.
Maybe bid and ask depth can be somehow used to at least estimate the psychological effect of backing up the value?

Short term: Will probably oscillate with some correlation to XBT hash power times current XBT price combined with BCH hash power times BCH price until a new equilibrium is found. Better whip out your differential equations for predator-prey models.
Medium term: I expect some value to move from XBT to BCC, so XBT down, BCC up; but this might be counteracted by a SW-activation boost to XBT.
Long term: fundamentals matter. Whichever solution will provide the promised scaling in a high tx-tp scenario will probably attract more value.

If merchant savings when using a BTC POS terminal with integrated full node outweigh CC fee cost it should be in their interest to make an investment in such terminals.
If you do not believe that economic incentive to run a full node exists, e. g., "I save money with BTC, therefore I'm willing to keep it functional if the cost of doing so doesn't outweigh the savings," then there hardly is any incentive but an ideological one -- and I fear that might not be enough in a free market.

IMO simplicity is always a good idea. Complexity is the enemy of the human brain. But we're getting philosophical here.




Part of the community argues against big blocks because they might increase mining centralisation. To me, one of the problems of mining centralisation is ending up with central parties that can block your tx; effectively freezing your assets.
Now imagine a scenario where SegWit+lightning enables big adoption of bitcoin. Regular folks won't be able to transact on a small-block chain (be that 1MB or 3.7MB). Instead of mining pools centralisation in the bitcoin layer, don't you think the economy of scale will force Lightning node centralisation? You're just moving the problem from the one layer to another, not solving it. BTW: I'm not saying that big blocks are the solution. They might, however, keep bitcoin in line with what Satoshi originally had installed for us, and who knows, maybe we end up with a dumber version of bitcoin (one where you just send instead of using intricate scripts where 2MB of payload can DoS your CPU) who's blocksize grows with technological advancements.

@_date: 2017-04-06 15:45:47
Well, TBH, most of both sides' arguments are shit in my scientific opinion as long as there's no proof.


First of all, it's a performance boost, so nothing wrong with that claim. The fact that it halts SW progress is secondary.


They are right. There is no proof this is real---YET!. If it's real, there'll be plenty of proofs soon. So far I haven't seen anything but claims. As soon as we have proof, this point will be taken care of. But come on guys, you didn't believe that guy was Satoshi without proof, did you?


Nothing wrong with that statement IMO. Good thing we have you and your expertise though pointing out the Gavin's incompetence!


See first point.


They should elaborate on that.


That's another claim which is worth as much as hot air as long as there's no proof.


Who cares?

@_date: 2017-04-24 12:24:50
Because of KISS. Keep it simple stupid. If all a miner cares about is a blocksize increase from 1MB to 2MB and he's interested to keep the amount hiccups as small as possible, he'd certainly prefer replacing the 1 in the code for a 2 instead of doing what SegWit does. I honestly do not think that either my assumption nor my conclusion is total bullshit. In addition, there's the moral hazard of SegWit being a stepping stone for a product pushed by a profit seeking company.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:22:22


I agree with you. But I think it's no longer safe for bitcoin to rely on its network effect. I think it's clear there no consensus for either SW or BU happening soon and for Bitcoin it'd nice if developers finally got to terms with that and started working on off-chain scaling that doesn't require any changes to bitcoin as it is today. Also, including features already included in other coins (e.g. anonymity vs. pseudonymity) would be necessary in order to not further lose market share.
@_date: 2017-04-24 11:16:24
Not wanting segwit might be a reason.
@_date: 2017-04-13 05:41:54
Well, the pump got me. Don't want to miss out when BTC is replaced. Better buy of the other superior coins as well in case money goes the way of anonymous txs. If you look at market share, the signs of BTC decline are already there. It hasn't been the most innovative technology in years, the block size stalemate just acts as a catalyst.
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:24:43
I wouldn't know know.
I just think apart from pro-sw and pro-bu there's a significant amount of folks that aren't in favor of either. For example I'm pro core (because BU software is horrible), against segwit, and for big blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:09:59
"Someone" is "counting" important economic actors "he" deems relevant. If &gt;75% of them say SegWit is nice, then there you go. Stupid as fuck but whatever...
@_date: 2017-04-11 10:53:10
I also like the fact that none of these fractions that want to push their agenda, be it SW or BU, are getting what they want. If they're so smart they should stop crying and devoting their time to political campaigns and instead focus on off-chain scaling building on bitcoin as it currently is instead of fucking it up.
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:04:59
This could honestly break our neck. Best-case scenario: it horribly congests the network and no one can use it. Worst-case scenario: someone in charge might actually give a scalable solution, say LTC+SW+Lightning, a shot; this could "network-effect" Bitcoin to myspace.
@_date: 2016-09-15 10:33:46

Is their motivation to try to stop bitcoin by refusing service for anyone involved with them? Sounds pretty stupid. I know we like to portray bankers as stupid, but this is more than naive, especially when thinking of the guys in charge of such decisions.
Or are there perhaps legislative implications we have not considered such as, e.g., they have to monitor and report on repeated activity related to bitcoin. If that's the case the path of least resistance obviously is canceling accounts instead of hiring staff to deal with regulations.
Are we sure the former is what's going on? If it's something else then the issue could be addressed.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:28:11

Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that at least tries to solve scaling. The value currently in all other cryptos is maily from pure speculation; all of will come back to bitcoin once the weak of mind realize that in the long-term usability is what matters.
Also, no relevant countries are interfering with Bitcoins evolution and ongoing integration into the financial system.
And one of my favorites: The cold currency wars that started after the 2008 crash have now turned hot. All, and I mean all major currencies are in the process of devaluating in order to keep their country's export industry competitive. We hardly notice any changes of these currencies against one another, because they all devaluate simultaneously. We all know where this road will lead to.

@_date: 2017-05-04 10:03:25
TBH: the system worked for quite some time. I don't think they mean bad, honestly. It's just the prevalent theory in economics. One of the FED's (or any central bank) stated goals is a two per cent inflation year per annum. They argue that this encourages spending and investment (which is not entirely untrue). From that it's easy to infer that your money will only be worth 1/(1.02^x ) after x years. FED created in 1913 -&gt; Your money is supposed to be worth only 7% of what it was worth then. It's by design, not a negative by-product.
The problem is that most people don't care or (want to?) understand this.
I'm not saying their strategy is perfect or even the right one; I for one am for quality over quantity and thus for a fixed monetary supply (as, e.g., bitcoin or a quasi-fixed supply of a gold-backed fiat currency -- obviously bitcoin has several advantages over gold). But I don't think they're out to destroy the economy.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:41:14
Well, I think it's just too complicated. On the surface, everything looks good: SegWit effectively increases the block size without a HF.
But it is short-sighted. You can only get some many TX in a 1MB block even if you put witness data in a separate block. Even with further improvements, at some point you'll run into a wall without a HF. So if you have to HF anyway, why not do it now without introducing more complexity to the code?
I'm ready to be swayed to the SW side by arguments, tho.

Thanks. Time to sell...
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:12:09
Help me understand SW please.
Non-segwit: block containing tx and witness, say 1 MB.
Segwit: 200-kB tx block plus 800-kB witness block. I still have to transmit both blocks between nodes which combined are 1MB. Nothing gained here.
Now I can keep the block size of 1MB and this block only holds tx data; in addition, we get this witness block of  3.7MB. So I have to transfer 4.7MB between nodes.
Is this correct?
Then how on earth can people argue against BU and a block size increase to 2MB because internet connections are too slow for such big blocks blocks; and at the same time be in favor of SW? Because they're imbeciles, right?
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:20:22
Obviously a clever ruse so noone suspects him of being Satoshi. Which he of course is!

Also, personal cost (i.e. tx fee) will differ from total cost (tx fee plus electricity cost of miners to process your tx and operate at all).
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:29:05
I know this is probably going to be a very unpopular opinion on here, but if the only rationale behind SegWit is to avoid a hard fork it is my opinion that SegWit should not be implemented. It seems like adding an unnecessary amount of complexity. Also, in the long run, the block size can only be increased so much this way. If further capacity increases do require a HF, why not do it now?
Logic dictates that HFing should be done with the less complex code. Rather than first soft-forking SegWit and then HFing to, e.g., 2MB regular and 7.2MB witness blocks, it would be simpler to fork to 4MB and then 8MB without any SegWit. I now understand why many people  presume "Core" (whoever that is) has no intention of HFing after a SegWit soft-fork, when the only reason for SegWit appears to be them avoiding a HF in the first place.
I appreciate any input if I don't have the technical facts straight.
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:43:48
Yeah and while you're at it, give us options for 2MB and 4MB blocks.
And yeah, I want Core devs to give me a Porsche. Thx
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:23:09
I say fork now and let time decide whether on-chain scaling is viable. Why can't we have some core devs create a core-fork, cause noone trusts BU code. Oh wait, Gavin got politically murdered for that. I better shut up.

I'm so smuck. You are dumb. Why would you want a 2MB block size when SW already does that?! You obviously did not know that SW increases the block size. That's because you're so dumb. But I'm smart.

I never understood the whole UASF concept. Some people power up a node with UASF, regular non-UASF nodes remain. You split from the regular network to some UASF-altcoin while all mining power and regular nodes remain on the Bitcoin network. What's the point?
Do you really think regular Bitcoin will break down because there's not enough nodes anymore? Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:00:53

Well, tbh, bitcoin was made possible by Satoshi. He put Gavin in charge and he and some very few devs delivered 99.9% of the important core code running today.
I think most of today's (not all, of course) "core" devs haven't contributed much value and are just freeriding on Core's rep.
@_date: 2015-02-14 13:51:00
Well, ok :-)
(1) Even at 'only' 9.5% instead of 10%+ p.a. I'd still call it inflationary; and
(2) Might be more than 10% due to increases in difficulty (i.e. time-to-block is lower than 10m); I don't remember where I got the 10%+ number, but I promise I didn't just pull it out of my ass :)

Any way to patch Core so my node won't interact with UASFcoin at all?
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:43:55
I'm somewhat uneasy about the apparent non-concern that is 2 chains when UASF triggers and then 3 chains when BCU splits. Both are set to happen tomorrow.
No matter how much value you attribute to any of the three chains, some glitches are to be expected, no? Or is the market simply chosing to ignore those?
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:23:10
Well, it should be easy to determine the number of SW TX vs non-SW TX on the Litecoin chain since the introduction of SW on said chain. That's field data.
Also, just because you don't think you were trolling doesn't make it so. You do not communicate technical facts in the exchange above but just cry around.
@_date: 2015-02-14 08:01:17
How come everyone's always taking about deflation? Bitcoin isn't deflationary. In fact, it's highly inflationary as of now (10%+). Once all coins are mined, it is per design neither inflationary nor deflationary. Sure, coins will be lost, but I think that'll hardly have a measurable deflationary impact in the sense people start thinking "I'll not buy a house this year when I can get fourteen next year!"

Predicting the future is hard, man :-)
Who could have foreseen mining pools? Pool centralisation? ASICs? In hindsight, sure... that was the logical thing to happen, but back then, no one could have foreseen it.
Off-chain scaling just means MOVING the exchange of tx data and tx validation from bitcoin nodes to some other nodes. Running these nodes is probably expensive, otherwise we could do scaling on-chain (I know, this conflates several issues, but in general I think you get what I mean). If its expensive, John Doe won't run his own off-chain node, so you can expect some centralisation... not hard to imagine banks/central authorities/whomever to charge for tx? censor tx unless they have KYC/AML-documents? something else?
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:01:07
Depends on from how far back in time you're looking.  I was there, too, and I don't remember seeing ASICs from a mile away. At least not from the early GPU era. There were FPGAs for a while to increase energy-efficiency. But ASICs involve significant design cost. Once you know these will amortize, you're good to go. But after the first crash to $6 noone was thinking of ASICs.
But, from hindsight of course, how could anyone not see ASICs coming :-)

Again, I say: Maybe, maybe not.
AM batch 2 could have the same disruptive effect as batch 1.
Looking at  you will find the difficulty has doubled almost three times, i.e. almost an 8-fold increase, over the last four months.
Absolutely no one would have believed that four months ago.
BFL has 65nm; if there are chips coming in the 20nm range, that alone suggests a 9-fold increase in processing power due to increased chip space, not including any improvements in chip layout.
I agree that the exponential growth can not be kept indefinitely. I just think it'll continue for some time.

Also, most ciphers don't scale for every application, using AES-CBC-256 for Internets may be cool. For phones, too, now that the chips include hardware AES, but before that, they used different ciphers for different applications from suite a.
If you're looking for a document saying "Use Suite A for really important stuff, because we've backdoored Suite B" I'm sure you're out of luck :-)
Or ask Mr Snowden maybe.
BTW: I'm not claiming it is a fact. I've just argued what points make it very like in my opinion.


Good to hear that even they make mistakes :-) Security by Obscurity FTW!
To sum up my thoughts: I think at this point in time - after all the revelations from Mr Snowden - it is only natural for us skeptics to become even more paranoid. Arguing: "That's unlikely" or "They wouldn't do that" or "Hey, that's illegal" is no longer simply naive, but stupid. Some weeks ago, people might have argued that it is technically impossible to filter through most of internet traffic and meta-data in real-time. Get my point?

The longer I'm involved the more critical I become bitcoin will ever be a paradigm shift and the money of the people. On-chain scaling for the entire world isn't possible unless there is some mathematical breakthrough that makes storing of all previous data unnecessary.
Off-chain scaling is a) yet to be delivered b) noone knows if that'll devolve into centralized institutions just as banks today, robbing bitcoin many of its original appeal.
All I see is a global almost-instant remittance system with insignificant throughput. Which is truly amazing, but far from Satoshis p2p-cash vision.

Not even by launching FUD-campaigns on TV that the world will end if we don't break the rules.
Politicians govern the policy of our money as them deem fit. If they think it's smart to print $1bn to bail out banks (who rob us of our money), in the process inflating the currency and stealing from us the second time then there's nothing we can do.
With bitcoin there's nothing THEY can do.

Okay, here's a serious attempt: Mining for the small man is over, economy of scale is taking over -- period.
Companies selling their gear at a loss (i.e. not mining with them on their own as long as it's profitable) is hardly going to happen.
See BFL, Avalon, etc.
Short-term profitable mining today looks like this: Wait for company to announce new product with major advantage over competition (think: 10x hashpower of the current state-of-the-art ASICs), order on the first day, hope they are not a scam, hope to get your device in time, hope the specs hold as advertised, hope they won't be shipping the remaining orders too fast so you have an advantage, etc... Empirically KNC is just an outlier, BFL, Avalon, etc. seems to be the norm unfortunately.

It's not like SHA256 is written in stone. All hashing functions have a history of being weakened over time; the same will happen to SHA256.
Same goes for computing power. When (not if) computers become 1000x faster (they're working on replacing silicon with something that can be clocked in THz, multi-core, moore, etc.) bitcoin will just up the ante by swapping the hash function/elliptic curve (thereby increasing the number of bits) _if necessary_. I don't think computers 1000 times as fast would require that, tho.

Hardly. There is something called the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. Every serious vendor's hardware conforms to that. Even Nvidia :-)
The real problem with floating point numbers is that you only have a finite precision: They provide a high resolution for values around zero; however, this resolution decreases the further you move from the zero to +/- inf.
In a very simplified manner, you can think of it like that: Around zero, you can store values like 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 -0.1 -0.2 -0.3 -0.4 -0.5. Once you reach, say, 1000, you can only store 1030, 1020, 1010, 1000, 990, 980, 970.
Therefore, because the difficulty can vary over a great range of values, using floating-point representation will result in rounding artifacts which are inherent to the floating-point number design, not different implementations.

That's what I'd like to have sorted out. They can have vague terms, but *if* there is a law that tells them to do what their customers want, then they have to abide by it. Exit is always an option if such a law does not exist.
Problem with "just leaving without fighting back" is: what if the next bank also decides to go down that road? It's too soon to abandon banks altogether; in 5-10 years, maybe it's another story, but right now the banks can somewhat impede bitcoin's success.

70% per month is way too low.
Assuming a conservative 30% increase per difficulty adjustment (which, approximately takes (14days / 1.3 = 10.7days), this means 31/10.7 = 2.90 difficulty adjustments per month, i.e. 1.3^2.9 = 214% diff increase/month.
Same numbers with 50%: 384% increase per month.
Granted, the way I calculate time to next difficulty increase might be a bit aggressive, since it assumes the hashrate increases instantly at the beginning of a diff. interval; but it's still better to have an aggressive est. than assuming a 14-day interval, which is just as wrong.
Assuming linear growth for the hashrate in the diff. interval we get 31/(14/((1.3+1)/2))=2.55 increases per month, i.e. 1.3^2.55 = 195% diff. increase per month.
50% per interval: 307% per month.

That core can control everything in your device; read from HDD; access your precious encryption keys; blah.
Intel sells this vPro capabilities to companies for 'remote administration'. How do I know the government has access to this technology? I don't. I'm just saying the infrastructure is in place.

You're not rude. We're just discussing. But you have it wrong:
1. Doesn't matter. While out-of-order CPUs can certainly reorder instructions to achieve more instruction-level parallelism, they can only reorder it to a certain degree. Changing semantics/results is not an option. You will always get the same result. There's a scoreboard in the execution core based on the tomasulo algorithm that keeps track of not reordering instructions with dependency chains. Say you have
addps ymm0, ymm1
mulps ymm0, ymm2
then those instructions will always be executed in that order.
2. If a microarchitecture isn't IEEE-754 compliant you shouldn't use it to compute IEEE-754 floating-point numbers and expect correct results.

The most likely answer to your question is that it might not be such a great problem. As you've already mentioned, it will probably some more time for QC to become reality (at least for QCs with a number of entangled qubits to perform reasonable attacks); so, when it becomes clear where we're headed, we can just switch ECDSA for something that's QC-resiliant. And there are actually a lot of resilient cryptosystems available.
Think of it, since the inception of the idea of QC by Feynman, there has been a total of TWO useful algorithms for QC. One is Grover's algorithm, the other Shor's algorithm (which can be used for DLP and FACTORING).
Some highly reputable people even claim that QC will offer no advantage wrt to computational complexity whatsoever. PRIMES has been in NP for several thousand years, until some grad students found a way to do it in P in 2006. The same might come true for FACTORING.

It's not as easy to protest in America I guess, because... what would you protest against? For now, there still one exchange in the US, even tho all other exchanges have been fined extensively.
Instead of issuing public notices like in China the US has a more subtle approach. Using secret courts to enforce secret laws results in a population not knowing what it is forbidden to do. This is not a rant against your country, I know you guys are always very sensitive about that, but we all know the government controls its industry like an authoritarian country. "Yo Wikileaks, you trying to get on my nerve? Hey VISA, Paypal. You can no longer do business with those terrorists, got me?"
Hard to protest against laws you don't know about I guess. But you can always help by protesting again secret courts I guess.

I find it funny how some of the self-proclaimed incorruptible early-investor crypto-anarchists suddenly want to "make the legislators feel happy" to "make bitcoin grow bigger," just to fill their pockets sans integrity.
Making it grow bigger was never Satoshi's prime objective. Agreeing to, hell-- _coming up_ with the notion of giving the government the ability to blacklist (oh, you say it's not the ability of the government, but some company's... right, just like the government can't force VISA to do things!) will make bitcoin its bitch. Suddenly, they can "print" an infinite amount of "bitcoin value"; they just have to blacklist x% of all non-government coins in case of economic crisis, increasing value of their own coins through deflation. Will never happen? Riiiiight! Just like they don't record your every phone call, because that infrastructure is just there for, you know, terrorism 'n stuff!

Not as unlikely as you might think. They (GHCQ) had RSA more than a decade before it was discovered in the public domain.
People were also suspecting the NSA to have backdoored the DES standard that was released in 1977 by choosing weak constants for the S-boxes; turns out, the choice for the S-boxes made the cipher resistant to an attack called differential cryptanalysis, which -tada- was found by academia only in ~2003 I think. This means that they were almost 30 years ahead back in 1977. And that was at a time where they didn't have a billion $ budget to recruit the best mathematicians.

While this hypothesis can not be proven I agree with it to a certain extent.
I honestly believe that Satoshi didn't do it to get filthy rich but to help 99.99% of the world to get a say. I agree that all of the coins he mined will most probably never be spent. But whether that's 40% of all coins, I really don't know :-)

I'm very curious about where it'll stop.
I'm also very curious about why people are buying all sorts of mining equipment... maybe some buyers can enlighten me.
1 BTC for 1 USB miner @ 300MHash/s just seems wrong. You'll never break even. A Radeon GPU will get you the same for 1/5th or even less of the price (granted, power consumption not included)... and you can buy it with $.
Even if the price per BTC goes up, it's still a better idea to hold on to your one bitcoin, right? Let's be honest, the gross of people are doing this to get a profit from it. So I don't get the hashrate going up at this level when you can only purchase Avalon/etc. with BTC and you know beforehand you'll never break even.

I chose Sparkasse for a single reason. ATM availability. But I'm willing to change banks over bitcoin; even more with banks being required to "move your account including all recurring transfers" for free since SEPA.
But. I think changing banks is the wrong way. I'd very much prefer to get this sorted out before a court. Can a bank decide not to wire money to mt.gox? I mean sure, they can block my transfer if it involves illegal activity. But this is different. Sure, it may say so in their AGB/EULA. But I don't care for that very much. They're bound by German law and I'd be damned if there isn't something about banks doing what their customers want in there!

I like your point about DES, maybe because it's a point I often like to make as well. But. That was some time ago. Things might have changed within the NSA. Also. Even if they made DES "stronger", it was not before shortening the 128bit key length to 56 bit. Why? Because they could brute-force that keyspace at that time. Because they had the money to build ASICs that could. That's a fact!
What can we learn from this? Maybe the NSA only pushes standards (later published by NIST) that they can break? I'd bet 100BTC on that instantly. Why? Because it's in their interest, that's why! Why? Because they can (it's mathematically possible as OP stated, and, what's more: You can not proof they did!). If they didn't go for it they'd be stupid, that's why! Why? Because it's their fucking job to break fucking encryption, that's why! Why do you think all Top Secret/NSA-internal/military-grade encryption etc. uses Suite A ciphers designed by the NSA that are not published? Because they didn't backdoor these.

1. Due to its high latency the rdrand instruction is meant to be used only to seed PRNGs. XORing the value of rdrand with getpid() and/or gettimeofday() won't hurt your entropy, and you can be sure it won't cause 'secret backdoor problems.'
2. Additionally, there exist statistical tests to verify the integrity of entropy sources; if there is something fishy, it would be easy to detect.
3. I don't think Intel would do something like that, because some of their rich HPC customers (i.e. financial industry)  would not react too kindly to any screw-ups I guess.
[Also, who needs to implement a broken random number generator, if he can already activate your CPU via GSM and access all your encryption keys when they are in CPU registers via vPro :-) ]

Short answer: No.
Long answer: Hardly. I mean, there's always the possibility, but it's like CPU mining 1000 blocks in a row I guess.
QR codes contain error correction. So reading 'a little bit' wrong is pretty much out of the question. Even if the error correcting part becomes corrupted in such a way that the QR code as a whole makes sense, a bitcoin address itself contains a checksum, which acts as another safety guard.
@_date: 2013-09-26 05:37:08
I agree. But still, going down from BFLs 65nm to 20-something nm will give a 9-fold increase "for free," not accounting for improvements in design, so I think we can assume the race is going to continue at least for some time. People have been buying ASICs like crazy in the past, not understanding that they will most likely never net them any profit. I expect this to hold true for next generations of ASICs as well. Hell, they even pre-ordered the whole damn first Monarch batch.

Well then, hello there fellow HPC nerd :-D
I know, in HPC we do evil things, like "-fp-model fast" compiler flags for icc which allow things like that. But are you absolutely 100% certain that the default language standards (such as C, fortran, etc.) with do allow such reordering?
I know, (A + B) + C might not be equal to A + (B + C) due to non-associativity of floating-point numbers. But that's why the IEEE 754 standard doesn't allow such reordering, right?
Say we have A in ymm0, B in ymm1, C in ymm2. Then the C language standard will generate:
1. addps ymm0, ymm1
2. addps ymm0, ymm2
The reordering hardware will detect a dependency chain and not reorder the instructions.
Did I miss something?

IDK. I mean, they are shipping. Hundreds of GH per day. Sure, now everyone's refunding because they can no longer turn a profit. But they're still adding power to the network. And while I have no proof, I think that most of the increase in hashrate can be attributed to them. I don't know too much about the other manufacturers... are they already using smaller fabrications like 20-something nm? I guess in that case I'd have to revise my statement about "an easy 9-fold increase in the coming months."

AFAIK it's purely semantics. You can't have an app that generates signatures; you can have an app that "phones home" to a server, which generates the signature for you. Stupid? Yes. Because you give up your control over your private key. But it works.
At least for as long as Aplle doesn't change its mind for no reason. See the fine print :-)

When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.
They don't want anyone to start an alternative payment system.

I was referring to bitcoin, not to pubkey cryptography. It is considered bad practice to send change back to yourself and reuse the same address, because it reveals your public key.

Good thing we're also uneducated (okay, okay, bottom quartile of OECD countries), which is why I can't understand you over all my ignorance!

I disagree. By handing over your authority/competence of your own money over to banks, you're bound to be taken advantage of. You're saying banks, per se, are not evil. Well, I disagree. They're pretty much mooching off their customers' stupidity (overdraft loan, high interests, selling bullshit investments they make money off but know they suck, etc.).
Today, you don't even have the opportunity to manage your own money. You need a bank account for everything. Bitcoin changes that; let's keep it that way and not fall back to "I don't want to worry about that." Otherwise, welcome back to fractional reverse bitcoin banking, bank runs, etc. -- the things we want to get rid off.
