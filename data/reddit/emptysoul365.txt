I've lived in countries where private insurance is rare (the UK) and where it is common but not required (Australia).  What is your personal experience of the different types of health systems?   Do you have ANY personal experience of a universal healthcare system or are you just speaking from a position of absolute ignorance?
I felt much more secure in the fully covered world of the NHS than the bit-part coverage provided by health insurance companies in Australia where you will ALWAYS be out of pocket in the long run.

The doctors are paid by all of us through taxation and the doctors decide which treatments are required.  It's how civilised nations run their health services.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:45:08


Why is socialism such a disgusting concept to you when it has been proven to be the best way to run essential services such as Health and Defence.  You do realise that the US military is built off the back of socialist ideology, don't you?


Isn't that still preferable to doctors only being allowed to choose treatments that are profitable to the insurance company and the hospital?  Why should people be allowed to suffer and die just because their treatment would cost shareholders money?  Do you not find that absolutely abhorrent? 


Where is your evidence of this?

It doesn't even mention Bitcoin Cash until after the app is installed and the wallet has been created.  Once you've installed it you then have to create another new wallet and it gives you the choice between BCH and BTC without even saying what the difference between them is.  There's simply no reason to make this so obfuscated unless the developer is intentionally trying to confuse or deceive uninformed users.

Yes.  I'm not a huge fan of how LN works but I think it's still too early to judge if it will be effective (I suspect not).  But that's not really anything to do with the topic at hand, is it.  LN is not deliberately deceptive.
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:35:55
It's very misleading.  Only bitcoin is mentioned until after the wallet is created.  You then have to manually create another wallet in the app which also assumes you know that BCH is Bitcoin Cash and NOT Bitcoin.

Wouldn't it look exactly the same except with different y-axis labeling?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:47:17
Same.  I bought in at 6000, 6800, 7500, 9800 and 10500.  
I had the money way back when it was under 1000.  Just wish I'd had the stones to buy in then.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:04:44
Oh same here!  Even if it hits 7k i'll be going in.

If he'd just invested his inheritance in a bog standard low risk portfolio he'd be richer then he is now.  The man's a moron.

Obvious truths don't need to be learned.

That'll be 17% in a matter of days.  If that's not a return I don't know what is.

I've done a few transactions with Smile.co.uk and never had any problems.

No need to obfuscate it.

Who enforces the rules in a rulerless society?

I'd be pretty happy with another year of horizontal.  It'll give me time to reduce my average buy-in.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:54:09
Whoever created this timeline seriously fucked up!
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:58:41
I panic bought at &amp;18k XD

Governments can be voted out and have limited powers in a democratic system.  THere is no recourse in a Libertarian one.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:27:14
Libertarians not thinking things through logically?  Never!!!
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:01:40
To the core!!!

Mmmmm...round bottom.

Buy back what you spend.  I think it's important to keep there retailers interested.

Tea leaves.

They'd have to be priced significantly lower than gaming cards as otherwise miners would just buy gaming cards which are easier to resell and will hold their value much better.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:59:57


Mainly because nobody else will ever look at that.

I hear he's not even a real person.

FOr Bitcoin, Litecon and Bitcoin Cash yes they are.
For Ethereum, no.  GPU's still rule the roost.

It's not ever their "invention".   They basically took the existing Bitcoin solution and essentially changed a parameter.   It's like taking a car, putting a bigger exhaust on it and then claiming to have designed the car and it is in fact the original.

It's the most non=apacolypse resistant forms of currency I can think of.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:37:18
Is it?  Kidnappers never really had many issues before crypto became a thing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:00:37
I think the best thing about it that with every 10% drop I am losing less and less money.  Hopefully if it keeps going down I'll start actually gaining :)
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:41:47
Aaaaaand...this is why I avoid Twitch.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:30:25
So are you going to take this opportunity to state on that you "have nothing to announce"?
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:26:57
If the poll is open until Wednesday why has it already been announced that you'll be using BCH (even though BTC is ahead in the poll)?
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:26:58
It's not so much an exchange but more of a CFD trading platform like eToro.  They're nice easy ways to get into trading not only cryptos but all sorts of other stocks and commodities.  
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:32:16
It certainly doesn't appear that way. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:10:16
Thats so true.  WHen I checked this morning my portfolio was down 10% over 24 hours.  THere was a time when that would have had me panicking.  Now it's just....meh.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:24:22
Even though you've posted on the thread linking to the yours.org page over on without even mentioning that it is false and that it is in no way affiliated with you?
Sounds fishy to me...
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:50:32
Might as well but it in a blender and drink it like a smoothie then :)
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:04:57
One of the pitfalls of being twins I guess XD
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:11:36
Not really.  If I lost 100% of my investment tomorrow it wouldn't affect my day to day life one single bit (i'd a be a bif miffed though)...still addicted to checking though.
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:30:33
But it doesn't give to those in need.  It just gives to random people on the internet.
The yours.org page is just a blatant BCH shill attempt.
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:06:49
I bought at several points between 6k and 19k.
Averaging out i'm just below break even right now.

It's a win-win.  If his prediction comes true I'll be a millionaire.  If it doesn't I get to see a man eat his own dick.
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:18:26
*sigh*.  Tell me about it.  I first heard about bitcoin when it was only just breaching $50 back in 2013.  Back then I didn't really understand what the point was or even how to get my hands on any.  I wish I'd spent more time looking into it to be honest.  I only eventually jumped on the train when it was around $5000.
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:44:43
As long as you re-purchase whatever BTC you spend you won't lose out.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:13:51
And those that do tend to have a ridiculous price narkup in my experience. 
Give me something its worth spending on and id happily spend (and rebuy).
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:39:54

You don't think the internet has been a net benefit to human society?

Mobile data doesn't exist for everybody.  Take a peek outside your own bubble for a second.
@_date: 2019-05-09 04:58:38
That's one zany reality filter you've got there.

Why would everybody switch to a worse technology than they already have in many cases?
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:37:14
No reason why not...but i'm sure airlines will charge through the nose to access it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:19:28
I live on the outskirts of Sydney and barely get a signal usable for data on my mobile phone.  There are plenty of rural areas people live in that have virtually no coverage at all.  And that's in a first world country!
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:07:58
So it's better to leave them with no internet at all?
