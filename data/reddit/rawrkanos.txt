Why pay $9 for a litecoin when you can get .01 btc for $9? You seem to not understand that you don't have to use whole bitcoins. Your entire rant is predicated on the fact that BTC = $900, and that is a complete waste.

No, but it can be estimated to be around $300-$500 million. I wouldn't put it higher than that. Most coins were bought at low values and held. Most holders of bitcoins are just holding, waiting for wider adoption and higher value. Mining-hardware investment is around $150 million, tops.

But is it "$20K a day"-more difficult? Hell, is most people use PPS it could be higher than a middle-class salary... per day. Admittedly part of that is only because of the recent rise in value, but even before it suddenly quadrupled he was getting $7K-worth a day.

Your funds have no moved. Most likely it is a glitch and the reason you aren't being paid is because their system can't figure out why you should have so much.
Or it could be that they simply don't have 333.8 btc on hand to pay you and that's why it is taking so long. Keep quiet and hope they don't notice this. ;D

To answer your question without shuffling you away: The blockchain is 13 gigabytes or so which means it takes forever to download and your laptop will never mine a significant amount of bitcoins. You pretty much HAVE to buy an ASIC, now.

You understand exactly nothing about the real value of these coins. Holy crap.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:58:49
You don't understand how bitcoin mining or the blockchain works.

I've had frequent ACH delays even before now. But I've gotten the deposits eventually.

Whichever blockchain has the most solved blocks would be the "valid" chain. And it wouldn't be chinas.

The two problems with this are;  
Circuits aren't computationally complete, they can't do the hashing just with a complex circuit(I believe)  
Even if they are, the standard transistor-size for an ASIC is 28nm now, which is thinner than a human hair by far.

The easiest way to prevent this is for users to store their coins in a private wallet. The only way this could even pretend to happen is if a place like MTGox or CoinBase told a user they have X btc available when the actual wallets holding the user's coins only have X/25 btc.
And if any exchange was ever caught doing that, they would lose all their users and the ability to make further profit. And it puts the exchange at serious risk for a run-on-the-bank situation, and by default Bitcoin is designed to prevent it from being possible.
tl:dr; It can only be done at the exchange-level and any exchange that does it would lose all their customers.

It kinda seems like you're a bit fucked, honestly. :(

Less advantageous is accurate.
But the total difficulty of litecoin is also changed, because of this. And GPUs are the MINIMUM STANDARD for litecoin mining, now. If they ever gain a major value, FPGAs and ASICs will follow.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:51:04
Litecoin is mined on GPU with FPGA and ASICs in the pipe-line.
Bitcoin mining actually IS profitable, but a whole fuckload of morons cry about it when they think it will take more than a month.

Accept payments via coinbase and bitpay, get paid in USD on your side. Then the CEO and the investors don't have to worry about it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:25:19
Probably. But keep quiet, cross your fingers, and pray. You just might get rich anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:07:20
It really isn't, as I already explained. It is only possible in the sense that it could be done, but it can only be done at the exchange level and it would damage the ability of the exchange to operate as well as lose them all their customers when it was discovered... and it would be discovered.

Oh crap, you're right. To expand this fully;
Separate coins into 3 sets of three.  
Place Group-A and Group-B on scale.  
If equal then weigh two coins from Group C  
If equal then remaining coin is bitcoin.  
If not equal, heavier coin is bitcoin.  
If not equal then discard lighter group and weigh two coins from heavier group.  
If equal then remaining coin is bitcoin.  
If not equal then heavier coin is bitcoin.  
  
Just to cover all the steps/explain the full logic.
