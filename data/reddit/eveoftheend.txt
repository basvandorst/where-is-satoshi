Best alternatives to Coinbase to buy BTC/ETH?

This was stellar. My only criticism would be the time jumps. Some of them are so small and so large and the average person doesn’t know what day we started at. It may be interesting and more telling to say “Day 3,076” instead of “4 months earlier.” That way when we get to Day 0, we can say “Day 0, 20xx”. The audience will hopefully know more clearly this mans difficulty with an overt date depiction. I may be wrong and maybe you all considered it, and if so it’d be great to know your reasoning for one over the other. 
Again, great job and wonderful cinematography.

Using it as a payment method without regard for price is unfortunately idealistic. The person you pay, whether it be Starbucks or a gas station, may treat it like an investment, hoarding their newly acquired BTC until they can sell for a larger profit. Essentially perpetuating the very thing you’re attempting to extinguish. It’s not a wonder why all these merchants came out of the woodwork after we rock bottomed. “BTC ACCEPTED HERE.” If they felt as similarly as you did, they would always accept it —bull or bear—but they didn’t.

Sounds like your significant other knows of the market volatility; otherwise, why would you think he/she would believe you’re crazy? If it’s your money and you keep finances separate, no need to tell until you’re comfortable. If it’s your guys’ money, I’d explain how and why you believe it’s a good investment and realistically ballpark how much you’ve spent. I’m guessing you’re the more educated one regardless of their topical knowledge, so have a real sit down and get him/her on board with your convictions. And I’m sure it’s been stated a thousand times: don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose.

The reason you don’t see worldwide fervor is because you’re comparing the zenith of a bull market to the nadir of a bear. A slow, inconspicuous climb back up will reinvigorate the populous.

This thing predicts a three year bull run? I can’t imagine what the value of some of these alts that survive will become.

Only when your other assets sink does Bitcoin suddenly not have use cases.

You’re back again with another bull shit post? Was one for the day not enough? You’re not looking for answers. You’re looking to change peoples minds.

You just copied and reworked someone else’s acronym: FOLE. Why?
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:34:12
I get it’s hard to shill. Most things are when they’re failing. Let the market do its thing and it’ll rise again. If you find no value in it as a currency, sell when you feel adequately compensated.

Yes, happy customers are good for BTCs longevity. You don’t want to have people invest and let them watch it decay even if it’s short term. It’s smart whether people agree or not.

Are you thinking about buying? Are you already an investor? Are you doing a survey? Do you have an answer and reasoning of your own that you want to compare? I don’t get the point.

You have an incredibly strange vendetta against bitcoin to not own any, not want to buy any and be on Reddit posting about how red candles turn you on. Something’s a little weird my friend.

This feels like a half baked attempt at recreating the HODL thread.
