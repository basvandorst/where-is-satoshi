Casascius coins would be perfect for a gift, though the common minimal denomination is 0.5 BTC.

+1. You can say all you want about Gox, but at many levels this was the most valid ATH so once it gets passed we can say the new ATH is there in all comfort.

 Not true.

I think all meaningful, historical ATH are taken as of this moment, so probably this is the last of these news for a while.

This is truly sad. I was silently hoping Other Side's arguments about how bad Lightning Network is were in many ways exaggerated. But it looks like in not so many...

It would be too easy. Few more years.

I'd suggest to listen to first 35 or so minutes of this interview, with Andy Pag, MtGoxLegal group coordinator. He gives a great overview of the situation and answer a lot of questions that come into mind:

Back in da day there was a Vladimir Club idea (1% of 1%).

Wirex is one of these that actaully work here &amp; now, opposed to many other comming soon(tm) projects. Correct me if I'm wrong but AFAIK they mostly support EU and not the US?

In a sense that's correct. Most of creditors held BTC and always wanted percentage of that BTC back. They didn't wanted to sell it. Trustee though, needed to have some valuation of claims in fiat because how bankruptcy laws works. He didn't actually sold them at that point, but just given them some "imaginary" fiat-valuation. Now fast forward few years BTC went up a lot and, Mt. Gox stop being technically bankrupt (in that imaginary-bankruptcy-fiat-terms, while still only having 20% or so BTC originally owned by users), but that allowed to change the procedure from BK to CR and actually give that percentage of BTC to users, something they wanted from very beginning.
It's like you had gold in some vault that was partially-robbed, you may still want your percentage of your gold, whatever the price of it is, suddenly selling it in the process by trustee sounds like unnecessary complication.

Yeah all these interviews are good resource to get up to speed with Gox. The one with Brock is bit unfortunate, the two went too much into arguing and it wasn't as productive as it could been. I myself as a MtGoxLegal member were first very suspicious to Brock's ideas, but after tallying up all info I've got, he doesn't seem to have bad intentions towards the creditors and hostility towards him isn't really necessary. As Andy said, too bad he is conflicted with Kelman and Nilson, are they would make a nice team to fight the real villain: Vessenes.

Do you have some inside information or are you just basing the payout date from Trustee’s schedule? Do you closely follow the process? AFAIK there are still things to be done, deadlines will likely be postponed and payout within a month is as realistic as Tom Lee’s EOY price predictions.

I can only say in 2011-2013 community would be very happy about this (everyone was working towards adoption) and nobody will complain about these posts. Did bitcoiners became somewhat unwelcoming?
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:12:20
I am asking where are you getting your info from. 
@_date: 2019-09-03 07:43:52
What was the $$ value, roughly?
