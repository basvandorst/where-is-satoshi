Sad to say, you should have used the express withdrawal.

Not necessarily in HK. They have changed the deposit bank to Taiwan one long time ago. 
In addition, their companies may be registered in multiple locations (i.e. HK, BVI).  Their HK company may not contain any assets.  Even I am living in HK, I think there will be no use to file claim in courts in HK.
I think the affected persons should be united and set-up a discussion channel, if BFX is not going to cover our losses.

Enough for my personal use :)

That's why I am making the PCB, flashing the bootloader and firmware using the open source code of Trezor.

Given sufficient number of dice rolls (without bias), there should be enough entropy to generate a cryptographically secure 24 words.

Actually it is not that easy... you must have interests on electronics stuff, micro-controllers.  Many trial and errors, and patients. 
1. You need to source all the electronics components (e.g. STM32 ARM MCU, display, quartz, resistors, capacitors. etc.)
2. Print the circuit board using the schematics provided by Trezor (or design/modified you own one since some components are using alternative with different padding/package)
3. 3D print the case (optional if you want to run it barely)
4. Solder the components (High skills required as they are surface mounts) 
5. Compile the bootloader by yourself (it is tricky and is required some source code modification) 
6. Flash the bootloader and firmware into the MCU.
7. Pray god and hope that it is gonna to work when you plug it into the computer.

Printed circuit board.  Something liked that.

"All ASIC's move from 28nm tech to 16nm tech.
-More work is being done, therefore more security"
I don't agree with this argument.  Pushing to 16nm tech means that the one with obsolete technology (28nm) will be pushed out of competition.  And only the ASIC manufacturer companies which are capable to produce 16nm ASIC chips will survive and causing more mining centralisation (Assumed that less companies will be able to produce 16nm ASIC chips)

There is a mathematical way to simulate an unbiased dice roll.  It is tedious, but it is worth to do so if you store significant wealth in the bitcoin wallet.
