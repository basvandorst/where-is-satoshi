It has dropped up to 2% during last one year multiple times, but overall the trend has been that bitcoin has gained 20+%.
I won't seriously worry about drops of up to 3% in market dominance.

The nodes, and miners, together form the bitcoin network.
When a transaction enters this 'network', its aim is to reach a miner computer, so that the transaction can be included in a block. For that it should reach all the miners.
All such transactions, which are unconfirmed, are contained in what is called [mempool](
Running your own node does not make it reach any miner any faster, normally. And it definitely does nothing to improve its chances of being included sooner in a block.
The advantage of node is that a node is the MAIN or only setup whereby  you can directly verify what is contained in an address, or whether a transaction was confirmed or not. 
The other option is checking the balance on sites like blockchain.com, but then you are depending on that site.

I just got $100 from a client using Paypal.
I'm in India, so what I **really** got was about 91.7% of the market value of that usd. 
that's daylight robbery. 
and that's why I'd love to send and receive bitcoins, specially for international payments.
even in local payments, I'm sick of making bankers richer, and will switch to LN asap.

Btc can't have turnover of more than $600 billion. Any bigger and it would invite global government intervention.
So it can only grow 100 times. To $40000.

You need to learn javascript if you want to integrate web wallets with your site. Php too I guess.
c++ if you want to look into main bitcoin code on github, which is a bitcoin client named bitcoin-qt.
There are also python bindings, where you can send json requests to bitcoin core.

The margin on trade is normally 1%. so they traded 200,000 coins. Made 2000 btc in profit/fees. 
They are giving about 1.5 btc as reward. Its not that bad.

Ms word was the flagship product of a $500 billion behemoth. It was destined to succeed given the money Microsoft was ready to throw at it.
Anyway, you can't just randomly compare one product with another to make a case. It implies that what happened to one will happen with the other. Why should it?

Governments control currencies with their armies. They aren't going to sit back as money starts disappearing in a tax haven that bitcoin will prove to be.
They may even ban it or make it illegal if push comes to shove. US government once seized all gold from private ownership by force in 1940s. Same could happen with btc if it becomes too big.

Good point. But bitcoin price is also likely to rise over next few weeks, because that is the trend over part few weeks. So its not as clear cut as one may think.

There are very few use cases of bitcoin in India for a tourist. One is that in case she has a Indian phone number, she can recharge it using the zebpay app by paying using Bitcoin. There are other services too that can be paid for using Bitcoin using that app, but most won't be of interest to a tourist.

One of these days some particularly heinous criminals (think child kidnapping or worse) will be implicated with bitcoin. Then law enforcement will justifiably track the criminals' coins.

I think it will double in a year. So it will be $900 in 1-3 months.

Right now the sell price on zebpay is 55736 rs, which is only $812.
So the arbitrage opportunity is fast disappearing. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:11:52
Here is how it breaks down:
4.1-4.6 % is the paypal fee for international transactions. 
3% is the exchange rate fee. You get 3% less Rs for each USD received on PayPal.
2.5% is the current difference between selling price on Zebpay and international rates of bitcoin, with bitcoin selling for a premium on Indian exchanges like Zebpay. 
4 + 3 + 2.5 = 9.5% is what I see.  
I am a freelance programmer from India, so I know this stuff.

You can reuse addresses. Its not a big deal. 
People make mountains out of molehills. In this case, reused addresses are slightly less secure than addresses used only once. But people talk as if you are just giving away your bitcoin if you use addresses. 
Fact is, re using address is still as safe as desired.

Bitcoin right now is at its two year high. Odds are good there will be a correction.
Even with that, bitcoin is a much better long term play. In ten years, it could be 10-100 times more valuable per coin. Or it could be in the dumps. No one really knows. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 12:25:22
I just paid a $1 fee for a large transaction. Thats more than anything any bank would charge in my country.
If bitcoin price becomes 10 times costlier, this fee will be valued at $10.
Even the smallest transaction will then cost $0.50.
So yes, higher fees are going to be a problem. I feel that people will soon start to do less and less transactions. In my view, bitcoin will become a "store of value", rather than a micropayment solution, or even a payment solution. I once read someone describe that bitcoin will be like how rich people and hobbyists drive up the value of paintings, coins, and other such valuables. They hoard these valuables, rather than use it to do business.
That, in my view, is the destiny of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:25:46
No regret, but I'm in a conundrum. I get paid in bitcoin for my freelance programming work. I don't want to sell the bitcoin I receive because its value increases with time.

Even when you use different addresses, you will likely combine them later together. Then where is your "privacy"? exactly same place where it is with address reuse.
Security issue is just hogwash. Man will reach another galaxy before bitcoin reused addresses are hacked by the imagined quantum computers. They don't exist, and no one is certain they ever will either.

Its just not a good idea. There is ABSOLUTELY no reason price of bitcoin will rise more than inflation, even if it becomes the most popular digital currency ever. 
You know what, its already the most popular digital currency ever, so there are no more markets it can capture. 
Its not to say its price won't rise, but I personally won't invest more than 5% of my investment in bitcoin. Rest I would invest in companies like Berkshire Hathaway, which has been rising in price for last 40+ years. 
That bitcoin is limited means nothing. Even if its limited, if its usecase does not grow, its price will not grow more than sum of inflation and % GDP increase , everything else being same. Thats not that much of a growth. Just cause its limited does not give it value.
