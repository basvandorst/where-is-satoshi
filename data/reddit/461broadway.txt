Every block that is mined has a "reward" (currently 25 bitcoin) sent to the miner. This reward is set by the software to decrease on a particular schedule ( until there will be no more reward except transaction fees for mining blocks. 
Poofing bitcoin into existence isn't possible because the network has to verify mined blocks and transactions, and you have to get a majority of the network to agree that the poofing is valid. It won't do that unless all the steps leading up to the "there are X bitcoin at this address" are correct. 
There are better explanations out there... Google it :)

It's supposed to be a wash. The result of cost averaging is you're highly likely to get the average price for that period of time rather than taking the risk of getting the worst price for that period of time.

The block reward halving is simply $500,000/day less that the market has to absorb assuming all miners immediately sell. 
That's $182 million/year. Significant, yes... but it's pretty silly to claim the price will "certainly" do anything, given all the factors involved.

It might not ruin mining if the minimum supply created was a rate of, say, half the maximum. There could still be a reward for mining while periods of low demand are programmatically coupled with a lower block reward. 
The trusted price source issue can probably be solved reasonably well and operate as a separate network. After all, bitcoin was invented.

you only need to download 25GB of stuff if you want to run a "full node" which is not necessary. storing your private/public keys require nothing but the paper they're written on (although that would be pretty insecure if the private key was not BIP38 encrypted). web wallets are ok for small amounts.

I'm hoping these machines just end up disappearing because they don't make money for the owners. No one needs bitcoin so badly they're going to pay a high fee (6% in this case) and give away their personal info to some complicated ATM in a public place.

it's a public, shared ledger that the network of nodes agrees is correct. it is secured by a consensus network that is about 105,266x as powerful as the most powerful single supercomputer in the world (and this # is constantly increasing)
300 bits
they are transferred by nodes sending transactions over the network, and miners including them in the blocks they attempt to verify.
nothing "tangible" in the traditional sense is attached to a bitcoin, but they have unique properties. they are digitally scarce (exactly 21 million will be mined). there is no central authority managing the transactions. they can be transferred across sovereign borders without limit. ownership can be verified cryptographically. the blockchain includes every transaction ever made, and every bitcoin node has a copy. they can be divided into 100,000,000ths.

Well, of course. The purpose of recurring buys is to *guarantee* the average price over time. The decision to buy at $500 or at $300 or at $100 has already been made in advance.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:18:08
I think that would be a good deal too. Just curious -- what if it doesn't go to $80?

This type of thinking aims to ignore that things have a *current value*. Bitcoin is liquid, too, so there's no rational reason for doing it. It's delusional to say that nothing is lost until it is exchanged for dollars.

Coinbase will let you set up an automatic purchase of $50/week. I recommend this because you don't have to spend time or energy worrying about what price you'll get. Over time, you'll get a good average price regardless of what's happening.

Throw out the stones from all the cemetery homes,
For the violence of a nation gone by,
Or the politics of weakness and the garbage dump of souls
That will now black the sky.
Their yellow haze and crowds of eyes
Will plug up the mind that moves,
Moving with grace the men despise,
And women have learned to lose.
We'll share our bodies in disdain for the system.
I see you take another drag,
Our nation bends to kiss the hag.
The sky is a landfill.
I see you take another drag, I see you take another drag.
I have no fear of this machine!

In terms of the price, I think this is the dominant factor. I'm sure it can still go up quickly in times of high short term demand, but overall it makes sense that the price ceiling is limited by the newly created coins. 
The 2016 reward halving is a significant event in my mind in because it removes direct, automatic sell pressure.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:00:44
This concept might make you feel better and that's fine, but the reasoning is nonsensical. The asset **has a current dollar value** and you can't *currently* regain the lost dollars through this asset.

Thanks for pointing that out. I would argue the "technical" analysis itself is inconsequential, but the price is really just a proxy for market cap.
