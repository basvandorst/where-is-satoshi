It's very useful, but remains a terrible UI decision to throw away all change as a tx fee by default when creating a transaction. Even if that is the "correct" behaviour.

It's really not a problem if we are stuck on the same difficulty for a while. The blockchain will be getting slightly less boated than usual, and spam transactions will be pushed out. This is a good thing.
If Bitcoin had just one block per hour it would be far more decentralised and secure.

Theymos, stop playing authority, this community is united by aversion to authority, blah blah. Roger is at worst Theymos-lite, but better than that, gives a little balance to the debate.
Bitcoin is a huge collective of both reasonable and unreasonable people.

I really worry for Siacoin sometimes, when apparently its developers also don't understand Nakamoto Consensus

Yup, let's end this debate once and for all.

As far as I can see the Bitcoin chain remains perfectly intact. Anybody can create a spin off at any time, that doesn't make them have any relation to "Bitcoin".

Bcash is an altcoin. They agreed not to mine altcoins?

Only people who choose to move their Bitcoins there. Presumably, most will still value the 1 MB blocks very highly for their decentralisation and store of value properties. Seems like it's the best of both worlds. Nobody is forced to using the less decentralised blocks, but they are there for those willing to take a risk.

Except he wasn't convicted of that. But, that little fact is totally irrelevant, riiiiight?

...but he wasn't convicted of that, it's just some bullshit to make him look bad to the media and kill any public sympathy towards him. And, from comments like yours, it clearly worked.
