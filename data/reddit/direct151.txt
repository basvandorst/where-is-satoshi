Thanks guys... I checked all the computers I use to access BTCguild and they are all clean. Maybe somebody is playing games at BTCguild?? 
Winds up they did not lock the addresses. I am now locked in. Hopefully that does it.

Not cool at all... Although I don't think we have anything to worry about. It's pretty easy to prove bitcoin was in use WELL before this filing. Any lawyers out there can chime in on this?

How hard is it to setup a pooled mining service??

Interesting comments. Although I strongly believe that this type of technology is the future of currency... I don't think the technological barriers to why it can't be shutdown matter as much as the political. 
If this ever does pose a threat to a governments currency OR, more likely, it gets framed as a means for laundering and illegal activities I see a few strategic moves happening: 
1. It will be made illegal to accept bitcoins as a merchant. 
2. It will be made illegal for payment processors to fund bitcoin exchanges. 
3. A collection of "sponges" will be in the market to absorb large stacks in the bitcoin. 
Being that the market is only $101 million right now (small if you are thinking US government scale OR large bank scale) the sponge strategy will get some dollars off the market and soak up large amounts of BTC. Yes the sellers of the BTC will most likely get rich... but rich is relative to the scale I am talking about. 
Also  makes a good point about the large banks... I can't even imagine what those guys could do to our small market right now. Look what happened today. They would be able to control the price if they employed their power($$) and knowledge no doubt. 
Just my .02 BTC.

Yes, but that is short term. Eventually wouldn't there be limited sellers and one big giant gorilla in the room.
