None of that has anything to do with OP's issue, which relates to bank-preferred self-regulation.

lol I forgot that he tried, but the point remains. They should have picked a slightly smaller board. That's the entire story here. It's a moment that impedes upon suspension of disbelief, and it happens at the film's climax. It's not even necessarily a mistake. I don't know. I'm just saying this would not be a meme if the board had been 30% smaller. And it's *all* fake, so they could have just done that.

By your logic, any investment would be "still a gamble." There is no investment for which you actually *know* the odds except ones that are stacked against you, otherwise known as gambles.

The free market would only provide the education the individual could pay for. Your entire point is bullshit because of that (or, again, you are completely fine with crippling our entire species by neglecting a huge portion of children). Yes, poor people would be able to find *some* kind of "education," but it would be shitty. This is obviously true, or there would *already* be lots of private educational programs for poor kids. There aren't, because there isn't money in poor kids. Duh.

Financial institutions, via regulatory capture, have designed this very system. You are exactly 100% wrong. THIS is the "self-regulation" that the banking industry has managed to create for itself.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:27:24
That is completely and utterly wrong. The huge load on the processor absolutely does shorten its life even if the temps are low. Electrons firing through that sucker degrade the chip. This is a fact of computing.

I mean, you keep saying that, over and over and over. And bitcoin is still working. So either you're wrong or you're misrepresenting the real world situation.

OH my god how has nobody ever thought of this!?!?

LMAO "What benefits does the Department of Education provide?" You fucking nutcase.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:30:00
LOL again, you're saying they can just fuck off and fend for themselves. Everything will just work itself out. You are expressing that uniquely libertarian combination of callousness and idealism. "If nobody gets any help, they'll be better off!" You're making so many assumptions that there is not even a basis for argument.
Edit: And to go even further, if Ron Paul got all the things he wanted, many people would also have no access to internet, so your already flawed point becomes completely moot.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:15:22
It's crazy how many people think this is like buying stock in a company.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:11:29
No, it's not. It's just stupidly misusing the word.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:37:13
You're missing the point. The revenue isn't supposed to go directly to schools. It's not a charity. It's a governmental agency that sets and enforces standards. You are using a metric that measures the effectiveness of a charity. So what are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:02:06
I'm interested but confused by your point. It's not a charity. It's a governmental agency.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:02:04
You honestly should not waste your time learning about it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:23:28
There's definitely still bullshitting.

And if you can't afford it, then fuck off. That's your better world.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:25:54
No, James. It shows that you should have chosen a slightly smaller prop. That's all it shows. The moment is jarring, because the board looks plenty big for two, and he doesn't even *try* to get on it.
Edit: People aren't questioning the plot choice. They're questioning one aspect of how the scene was chosen to be filmed. It's something akin to a blooper in many people's minds.
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:19:02
How the fuck can you have a "really good neighborhood" in a "pretty bad economy?" You are obviously full of shit (or having a racist moment lol).
"Among shitty neighborhoods in the area, this is the white one!"
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:49:01
IF that's true, it's temporary. Or, again, you're assuming the white area is low crime. You cannot have "low crime" and a "bad economy" for any extended period of time.
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:54:34
I was thinking pretty much the opposite.
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:12:05
It's hard to be positive in this world if you're honest. The planet is literally dying and we're not doing anything about it.
Anyway, having that many monitors is just a waste of money, space, and electricity.

Pretty fucking dumb.

Hey, dumbass. He leaked documents to the press ONE TIME. Of 50,000, only about 400 have been released publicly. Members of the press, mainly the Intercept and the Guardian, have access to the documents and have recently been discovering new newsworthy stories that were never talked about earlier. A lot got overlooked or overshadowed by the enormity of the huge NSA programs that were revealed. Snowden hasn't done anything since 2013 to prompt this story.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:40:28
*IF* you don't care about losing your own money currently invested, and *IF* the price doesn't sink to near zero, it's kinda true.

In all seriousness, what happens when someone adds straight-up, not-at-all-ambiguous child porn to the ethereum blockchain? To possess the blockchain at that point, one would be committing a very serious crime in most places.

lol you are a dumbass
@_date: 2018-11-28 08:16:32
Ok, but in this actual case it's entirely appropriate to summarize that way. Also, that term was used by the guy originally making the point, so tell *him* to be more specific. When someone counters your initial assertion with their own assertion, you bring out the evidence. Making abstract arguments about semantics doesn't help the discussion. Just be more specific if you have a point to make.

Get an Italian bank account or convert to the local fiat like everyone else. Or just spend your bitcoins where you can.
Edit: I mean, what are you even asking for here? Do you not know about switching currencies when you travel? There isn't some magical system for visitors to convert their BTC to Euros that *works better than a system for locals*, which is what you are asking for. I mean, why do you think Bitcoin ATMs can get away with charging fees? There isn't some way to just poof up some Euros without a bank account or another person who will transact with you, both of which you aren't willing to try.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:52:46
It's a stateless state (hellhole), so everyone is a certain definition of "free." A Hobbesian definition.

There is no militaristic violence in Somalia, because there is no military. And there are no civilians, because there is no military. It's all free people violence.
And yes, Somalia is clearly *closer* to Hobbes's definition of total freedom (which, by the way, he thought was a terrible state for a human to suffer) than any developed or developing nation.

Dense? Happiness IS correlated with wealth, no matter how you swing it. Again, for people who suck at math, that doesn't mean that every single person or family matches the average. That also doesn't mean that the correlation remains constant across the entire spectrum of wealth. But there is an undeniable correlation.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:33:23

I think your totalitarianism is far more extreme (and dangerous, and terrifying) than their libertarianism, which I don't agree with at all. I'm so far on what you would call the left that I think the concept of "left and right" is almost entirely bullshit. So you're wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:29:09

@_date: 2018-04-07 22:28:43
Maybe you are bad at math, but what you just said does not imply that there is no correlation between wealth and happiness. OF COURSE there is a correlation, if only because it's virtually impossible to be happy when you are unable to feed yourself.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:32:59
Do you actually believe that? You are really, really dumb. "Poverty is equal to wealth."
