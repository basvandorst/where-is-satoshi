Use gdax for lower fee, it is an exchange owned by coinbase.
The reason that Chinese market is having 90%+ transactions is partly due to their 0 fee transactions.

why not just use coinbase?

people are irrational. You gamble one way or another. Say you invest in this company but not the other. When you drive or fly, you are gambling with your life to some extent.  When you eat, you have the risk of getting stomachache. Marry a woman is also a gamble.
Life is short. Go gamble and have some fun.  Just be prepare to lose.

Google/Facebook/Youtube are much easier to ban than Bitcoin.

Great post! But I think maybe we are in the stage of ignore and laugh. Check how many people around you knows about it? owns it?

Congrats! you must have some high-end clients.

you guys intentionally avoid gambling, right？
Pokerstars to adopt bitcoin and allow everyone on earth to  easily play poker would be cool.

I've used coinbase for a couple years. The only complaint I had was a bit slow customer support.
Their coins are claimed to be insured.  Might be safer leaving them there than keep private key yourself.

Good day, Sir!
