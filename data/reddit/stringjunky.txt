If someone is going to buy BTC, whether as an investment, a currency, or The Wave Of The Future©, they should perform due diligence, and that means research. And any cursory research would have revealed that MtGox has been shaky for some time now. This isn't some random occurance that popped up out of the blue. A lot of people on and several other forums  are saying "I told you so" because, well, they did, and have been for some time now. Several forums have been positively screaming "Stay away from the giant MtGox machine that is going to eat your money some day!" So, a lot of us aren't responding out of a sense of smugness or privilege, but more from a sense of "What were these people thinking?"

Yes, Reddit with a side of Google, and maybe 20 minutes with a cup of coffee, would have let you know that MtGox had been displaying symptoms for quite some time that should have warned most people off. It wasn't even necessary to see their books to know that they were in trouble. I certainly knew enough to transfer my MtGox holdings many moons ago, and so did a lot of other people. I'm not sure what has you so fired up, but it's the truth. MtGox's closing didn't catch me, or a lot of other people, by surprise, because again: any cursory reading about them would have told anyone that MtGox was in trouble. Internetting isn't that hard.

Trying to place some measure of protection on Bitcoin would just lead to early-adopters moving on to the next crypto-currency. And that may happen yet, but it certainly isn't a fix for people who are too lazy to research where they put their money. It would also almost certainly torpedo Bitcoin permanently.

Buy Btc, put it in cold storage. Don't feel comfortable putting a lot of money into a purchase with an exchange? Buy less, put it in cold storage. Buy less again, put in cold storage. Rinse, repeat.

One of the points of Btc is that no one is accountable for it or it's performance, good or bad.

I'm pretty far from being an an-cap, but I do strongly believe in the utility and necessity of bitcoin being decentralized, despite recent events.

@_date: 2014-02-25 18:19:13


I disagree with you on two points here:
1) I think a lot of the speculation recently into Bitcoin has been by people who are relatively new to investing, and *that* demographic seems to be fine with drastic increases in price, and genuinely shocked when the price falls just as rapidly.  I would say that *wise* investors are not okay with wildly fluctuating prices.
 I think that right now bitcoin is a terrible *investment*, but it was never really meant to be such. It was designed as a currency, which gives it a bumpy road to widespread adoption (whatever your definition of that may be). That road is complicated by the fact that it is a cryptocurrency, which makes it even more difficult to determine metrics for success and failure. 
2) After Bitfloor closed, every responsible bitcoin owner should have adopted cold storage as policy. Post-Bitfloor, there is no excuse for keeping a substantial amount of coins on any exchange, regardless of that exchange's reputation. Any amount kept on an exchange should be there for quick trades only, and certainly not any amount that a trader is not comfortable with losing anyway. The most effective regulation to mitigate losses in the MtGox scenario would have been to require bitcoin holders to use cold storage, except for coins meant for impending trade. Of course, no regulation of that sort would needed if people would just adhere to common-sense lessons that were hard-earned this year. So again, when people bemoan their MtGox losses, I do empathize, but I also can't help wondering what they were thinking.




At this point in the bitcoin protocol adoption curve, I think that people who aren't rigorous in their research are certainly at risk of losing money. That is regrettable, but the alternative, centralized regulation, would almost certainly kill bitcoin, if centralized regulation was practically possible in the first place. 


I would prefer, for now at least, a riskier, decentralized protocol. I think that if bitcoin does find increased adoption, then education about the risks and benefits will grow concomitantly. You are correct though: I am more concerned with the utility of a decentralized bitcoin protocol, than its eventual adoption. It has reached a point in adoption that makes it useful for me due, in part, to its anonymity. Centralized regulation would threaten that anonymity and thus, its usefulness to me. Without that utility, I wouldn't use bitcoin at all.

The Fed. It actually issued those pieces of paper you used. It dictates the US money supply (sorry, I'm assuming you're in the US), which in turn affects how many pieces of paper you have to hand over to the pizza guy for that delicious, delicious pizza. It also decides whether or not that paper in your hands is valid tender, and whether or not it should be taken out of circulation.

@_date: 2014-02-25 17:08:08
Nothing centralized, no. That's the point of the Bitcoin protocol, decentralization. Speculators seem to be okay with that when Bitcoin prices are up, but once the darker side of a decentralized protocol or currency rears its head in the form of market fluctuations centered on events that would never affect a centralized market, such as the NYSE, people suddenly lose their respective shit.

Excellent question!
Keeping your bitcoin keys in a safe deposit box is what is generally referred to as *deep* cold storage. Generally very safe, but the tradeoff is obviously in convenience and utility.
Cold storage can be a paper wallet or a usb drive, or just about any medium that can store a key offline (clay tablet, a dead hobo's jawbone, etc) that is readily accessible. Some people may quibble on the fine points of the distinctions between deep cold storage and cold storage, but I think the characterization I've provided is functional, at least.
Paper wallet instructions are [here]( If you think you'll be making several purchases with Btc (and you should!), you can keep a certain amount in an encrypted wallet on your computer (less secure than paper/usb/deep cold storage/etc, but more convenient, and still more secure than an exchange).

You are correct in that Uncle Sam didn't hover over your shoulder while you paid the pizza guy, but the Fed has already influenced your transaction with Pizza Guy. The Fed was the means, and thus the intermediary, of your purchase of that pizza.

I'm glad you didn't lose anything with Mtgox. Do your Future Self (you in 2, 10, 40 years, etc) a favor, and do some research on Btc before you do anything with it. Find the relevant forums, lurk a bit, ask some questions if you like, research exchanges and other ways to purchase Btc, and then if you still want to buy some, you can make an informed decision about the whole thing.
Regardless: good luck, be excellent, and stay  safe.
