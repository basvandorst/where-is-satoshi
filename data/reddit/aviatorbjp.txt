This is a design of the bitcoin protocol called "Child Pays For Parent". Basically what you did was you spent the unconfirmed bitcoin in your "change address" (basically the same thing as spending unconfirmed bitcoin). The thing that unstuck the previous transactions was the larger fee with the new tx. In order for the miners to claim that fee, they also had to confirm the low fee trasactions that the high fee transaction was predicated upon. Happy New Years! Isn't Bitcoin awesome?!
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:07:36
I think because the fact that miners have to include the previous transactions to confirm the new one, the new one "looks" like it is the size of all the unconfirmed transactions in the string. So it basically becomes a weight of total bytes vs total offered fees. So I don't think it can be used to save on fees. :)

I am excited about this project, I even donated to it. But there is a big chance this will not be cost effective. It will be interesting to see what Scott can do with the million dollars. I sincerely wish him the best of luck.
But solar in general is getting cheaper and better all the time. I just saw some panels go for sale at 66 cents per watt, which is crazy low. We are at the point where solar is cheaper than fossil fuels in some cases, and soon it will be cheaper in most cases.

I would also make the distinction between an encrypted paper wallet and a non-encrypted paper wallet.
A non-encrypted paper wallet is like cash. Anybody who can physically get their hands on it, can see the private key and use the bitcoin. So this type of wallet protects you from online theft, but is vulnerable to physical stealing.
An encrypted paper wallet is sort of like a check; it is only redeemable if the check has been signed by the account holder. Basically this type of paper wallet is useless without a password to unscramble the keys. You can keep the password safely in your head (or secret location) and only have to worry about physically loosing the piece of paper. So you should keep multiple copies in multiple places.
Also, care should be taken when creating a paper wallet. Key loggers, trojans, viruses, etc can be recording the private keys of your wallet while you are making it; malware can also infect newer printers. The safest way to make a paper wallet is to use a Live CD ( [like this one]( ) on a computer that is disconnected from the internet, with a dumb (older) printer.

The block time is not a constant. Some blocks are found in 5 seconds, others take 50 minutes. But on average, they are generated every 10 minutes. This is process is hard coded into the bitcoin protocol, and would take a majority consensus to change it, causing a hard-fork in the protocol.
Every 2016 blocks, the system automatically checks itself and determines how much computing power is on the bitcoin mining network. After calculating that, it adjusts the "difficulty" of the work the miners are doing, so that (no matter how much computing power joins the network) the block times remain roughly 10 minutes on average.
As for a place to read up: if you haven't already, a good place to start is the [Wiki FAQ](
You can of course ask questions here on reddit, but there is the [Bitcoin for Beginners]( sub that's primary function is to answer questions. And [r/BitcoinMining]( is specifically questions and chat about mining for bitcoins.

But are you really going to argue that it's a bad thing that people with a previous savings account balance of zero are now saving something?
They still have to spend money. There is rent to pay, we have to eat food, we have to travel to work, we have to pay our utilities, etc.
Also, unless the person is some kind of 'bitcoin monk,' everybody spends money on entertainment of some kind. 
So if the economy is so fragile that it will tank if people start saving some of their money, then the current model is already out on a limb, and I say let it fall to its death.

Yep exactly. The network automatically and periodically readjusts the difficulty of mining. If more miners join, the difficulty goes up, if miners leave, the difficulty goes down. 
The difficulty has its minor ups and downs, but its growth overall has been logarithmic. [See the chart here.](

When the last fraction of a bitcoin is mined, it means that the amount of money in circulation is limited. But because bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimal places; so if 1 BTC was worth a million USD, then 1 Satoshi would be worth a penny. With a market cap of 21 Trillion USD at that price, that means there would be plenty of bitcoin to run a large economy.

Encrypted paper wallets, with multiple copies stored in separate physical locations. Seems like the best solution to me.
@_date: 2014-05-14 08:01:33
At this level of difficulty, at this price point, and at the current value of bitcoin, it isn't a great deal.
If you are going to do it, do it for the shortest amount of time allowed. Consolidate all the hashing power into a small interval, because the difficulty will kill you in a matter of days.
For example, the price would need to rise to $490/BTC in order to break even during a 4 week bid. The price would need to be around $540 to break even at 2 months.
Add on top of this, that I have never heard of these people. Do they operate like a pool? Do you only get paid if you actually find a block? Simple questions like this need to be answered in the FAQ.

The miners get a reward for solving each block, so you could calculate how many bitcoins have been mined. You would just need the halving schedule to do that accurately.
The number of blocks doesn't say anything about how much people are using bitcoin. If nobody was sending any bitcoin, a block would still be produced, but it would contain no transactions. [This Chart]( is where you can see how much people are using bitcoin.
So I think of the blocks like the heartbeat of Bitcoin, each beat is about 10 minutes long.

You can get bitcoin in many ways. However, because people value bitcoin so much, you have to make an effort to get very much of it.
The most straight forward way to get BTC is to buy it, either online or at a bitcoin vending machine (if you live near one).
If you are computer savvy, and have money to spend on computer hardware, you could try "mining" bitcoins. However, it is very difficult to earn a profit by mining lately, because there are so many people doing it. 
If you have no money to buy BTC directly or to invest in a mining rig, then you could work for a company that pays wages in bitcoin. Or you could start your own business that accepts bitcoin for payment.
If you can't do any of the above, you can go to "bitcoin faucets" around the internet, and they will give you tiny amounts of bitcoin in exchange for doing capcha puzzles. 
There is also a minecraft server that pays the players for every block they modify in the landscape at minecraftCC.com.
And as you have seen, occasionally people will conduct bitcoin giveaways on Reddit. You might also be tipped by other bitcoin redditors for posting really good content or comments.
Hopefully I have helped answer your question. Cheers!

There are nearly 13 Million Bitcoins in circulation of the 21 Million that will ever be generated. It will take many decades for the remainder to be mined. 
Blocks are generated approximately every 10 minutes, and these blocks hold the transaction history of every transaction within their time period. There has now been over 300k blocks found; so the very first transaction has over 300k confirmations now.

Not an issue. Currently we have a glut of miners. Eventually a balance will be struck that takes into account: the spot price, average fee size, number of transactions per block, etc... and the best part is that it will be self correcting.
If miners continue to mine at a loss, then they will start to leave the business. More tx fees will remain for the people that stay.
If miners have the ability to prioritize payments by order of tx fee size, then that will cause upward pressure on fees too. So let the fee be optional and of any size, and let the miners compete for the fees. If they charge too much, they will get less transactions and therefore less fees, especially if another miner is including fees of smaller size.

**Serious answer to your question** (lots of flame in the comments)
If you take 1 BTC and Color them to be "bstationCoin," and you want to sell them for 10 BTC, then you are only going to be able to sell them if they represent that kind of value, or the issuer (you) is trustworthy to redeem the token for what they were made for.
For the value example, if your new coloredcoin represents a 1/10th ownership in "Bstation Inc." (a well known company with a good reputation), then this is the equivalent of issuing stock. Bstation will need to publish a legally binding document saying that who ever owns BstationCoin is now a part owner of the company. The coin would then be as valuable as the market thinks it is. So you will need to provide reoccurring documentation of how the company is performing, so the market can decide how much the stock is worth. If more people want in on the action, than want out of it, then the price rises. Visa Versa. 
For the token example, you could use BstationCoin as a ticket for a specific event: like a concert, an expedition to the south pole, your birthday party, etc. But buyers have to trust the issuer (once again, you) to keep their promise that the colored coin will grant them access to the event.
So the big downside of colored coins is that it reintroduces trust-induced-risk into bitcoin. The responsibility is on the issuer to make sure they are 1) trustworthy and 2) seem trustworthy. 
Another part of the trust downside, is that the issuer will lose anonymity in the process of demonstrating that he/she is trustworthy. You will be divulging information that allows people to verify the claims you are making, and take you to the authorities if you are found to be fraudulent. 
An upsides (for me) is that consumers get the benefit of having their trust competitively earned by the issuer. And also the shareholders can stay anonymous if they choose to. They can vote with their shares by signing transactions with them. They can claim dividends by simply signing transactions. They can trade them with other people without divulging who they are. Anybody can buy stock with colored coins; normal people can buy stock, where before we all had to go through a broker. 
There are certainly more use cases for CC than I can think of. But these are some of the basics. Cheers.

Until their is more of them, all over the place, they can charge what ever fee they want because each machine has a geographic monopoly. The only other options are a shady meeting with a local bitcoin person, or wait a week for a coinbase transaction to go through.

I haven't spend bitcoin at expedia, because I haven't needed a hotel room or airline ticket.
I haven't spent bitcoin at new egg, because I don't need a new computer. Yet.

Saving bitcoins removes them from rapid circulation, but they are still in the monetary supply. People who save money intend to spend it eventually. This is why the term "bitcoin-days-destroyed" is so useful when talking about the bitcoin economy.

@_date: 2015-01-03 17:37:38
It is inflationary, but the rate of inflation is constantly decreasing. Eventually, the rate of inflation will be close enough to zero to consider it nil.
The only thing that could make Bitcoin deflationary is if you account for lost/destroyed/unrecoverable bitcoins, and if that loss rate is higher than the current inflation rate.

Also, you can see the list of all bitcoin nodes by going to these links:
[List]( or [Globe](
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:32:37
I don't know if there is a disadvantage to having more than one full node on the same IP. But I do know that there is an advantage to having full nodes in as many different physical locations as possible. It decreases the latency of the network, and mitigates the risk of loosing a bunch of nodes due to power outages.
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:13:05
A full bitcoin node contains a complete record of the blockchain, and connects itself to (typically) dozens of other peers on the bitcoin network. 
The basic way to run a full node is to use the latest version of Bitcoin Core, let it download the whole blockchain, and set port forwarding to 8333 on your internet router. That's really as hard as it gets.
How is this different from a wallet? Well, not all wallets contain a full copy of the blockchain. Lightweight clients just connect to a database somewhere in the cloud instead of storing it locally.
You don't need a terribly powerful system to run a node. There is some talk about utilizing Raspberry Pis as full nodes. Probably the biggest issue is hard drive space. The blockchain file is currently 38GB and growing at a very fast pace. Given the ever increasing number of transactions year over year, we could be talking about hundreds of GBs in a short period of time. Also, if a device is terribly slow, it might have high latency -and if too many slow devices crowd the network, it might slow the whole thing down. But I don't really know the specifics.
At the point that the blockchain starts consuming all of our hard drive space, no doubt we will have a new update to Bitcoin Core that allows different bitcoin nodes to hold different portions of the blockchain. "Merkel Trees" or "Pruning" are the words that get thrown around in this particular discussion.
So why is it important to run a full node if you can? Because bitcoin maintains its robustness by having a favourable ratio of honest bitcoin nodes to hostile bitcoin nodes. If the honest get lazy and some really organized attacker starts running a lot of nodes, he/she/they could try to distribute false blockchains, or attack our anonymity by recording the origin IP addresses of every bitcoin transaction. By sheer force of numbers, aided by randomness, honest bitcoin nodes keep the whole system running safely.

I just don't understand how you can have an interface with FIAT without having having trusted companies. Eventually someone has to put their bank account on the line.

Bitcoin in its current form might be restricted to just the earth. Just due to speed of light restrictions, 10 minute blocks, and the truly vast distances between the planets (let alone the distance between stars).

I think there is going to be a lot of selling pressure on the way up to $1000. That being said, I think the bulls are going to win 2015.

Probably not going to be making money off of those. But, I am actually looking to give away two 38 gh/s block eruptors and four 6+ gh/s butterflies. 
If you are interested in taking them off my hands, PM me. I would just ask you to pay for the shipping. *Edit* I don't yet know how much shipping will be, so you still might not make money off of my old ones either. ;)

The point he made was that a government operating with limited money supply actually has to take money from the people in the form of taxes in order to fight the war. People notice taxes.
As it stands, the government just creates more money to pay for wars, and people don't make the link between the war and the devaluation of their savings.
Of course there will still be wars if everybody is using bitcoin. There were wars back when money was just gold.

While I agree the price will probably return to that range in the near future, there's going to be a lot of resistance before we get back to the all time high. I doubt it's going to be something that will happen overnight.

I should probably clarify that I am not a buttcoiner. I just don't put much stock in "experts" when it comes to bitcoin.

Yes, you are correct. Coal miners don't create coal, teachers don't create graduates, reporters don't create news. But this is the surface level language that is commonly used. I try not to insist on being technically correct when talking with a newbie on any subject. If there is an interest, he/she will learn the nuances with time. But there is such a thing as information overload.

Coinbase is good, but it takes a week for a purchase. Once you are verified, you can pay with credit card for instant buys; but that costs more in fees.
I have never had a problem with them, but I have seen a few posts here where people were denied service for different reasons.

You can duplicate your wallet all you want. All that does is create multiple points from which you can access your bitcoin. The actual bitcoins exist on a single, monolithic accounting ledger we call the "blockchain."
Every bitcoin has a history starting with the moment of its creation. To create a bitcoin, a LOT of work has to be done by miners. This is where the phrase "proof of work" comes into play. There is no other way to create a bitcoin; just the mining process.
The only way to move bitcoins is to get a transaction included in a block. Each time a block is solved, it includes proof of the order it belongs in (includes the hash of the previous block). This is an indisputable time-stamp that keeps a perfect history of every single bitcoin. It's pretty damn awesome.

You can shut down your node at any time. I have never tried running a node on a VM, but that shouldn't be an issue.

I think the stronger message is that 1BTC will never be less than 1/21Mth of the total money supply. There is a limit to Bitcoin's inflation, and it is set in stone.

Ounce, sorry not gram. The video was of a 50 gram chunk, not a 50 ounce chunk. My bad. So each of those little squares is around $40. Still, cut that into 40th? Still hard pressed to get something that is sub $1 that isn't so small you would loose it.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:37:42
You are being sarcastic right? Who walks around with $60700 USD worth of gold in their wallet? Each one of those squares is a ounce! thats over a thousand dollars at the moment!
Could you imagine cutting one of those up to the proper size to buy a hamburger? Its just not happening!
This does indeed impede portability. Either you have to carry a jeweler's knife and a scale with you at all times, or you would have to cut them into such small pieces that they would be very difficult to find if dropped on the floor.

I wasn't thinking properly about where gold sat on the periodic table. Send me back to highschool, will ya ;). Gold is almost twice as dense as lead. So anything used in it to artificially increase its density is likely more valuable than gold. Or radioactive. Or both.
Still, what would a $1 transaction in gold look like? That's less than 1/1000th of a gram of gold. I don't know about you, but I do not have that steady of a hand.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:35:38
If someone came to my business, and offered to buy something for x-amount of gold, I would probably have to call in a jeweler to get the gold authenticated (probably by cutting it open) and verify its mass, and then I would have to research the market value of gold.
Bitcoin is superior to gold and fiat, in my humble opinion.

BTC-e has a trading platform for NMC.
You can mine them simultaneously alongside bitcoin.
Or you can barter for them.
