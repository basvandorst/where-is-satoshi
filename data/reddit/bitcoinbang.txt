They did something similar to me. They were using tiny amounts at first then larger amounts. It happened to me twice on two separate cards with two different numbers.

This is NOT what happen. I had two different cards from bitpay. Both were compromised. My original card got used on 10/7 and 10/8 in california. I call they send me a new card with a new number which I got on 10/18.  Then my NEW card gets used 3 days later but the fraudsters. I only used it 4-5 times total, none of which was at the places I used the old card.
Its a data breach or internal theft.

Yea this obviously isn't a "handful" of people.
This happened twice to me on two separate cards. Once on 10/7/2019 and once again on 10/23/2019 with a 3 day old card that was sent to me because the first one was fraudulently used. Both had separate numbers and weren't linked in any way. I literally used the new card 5 times over the course of 3 days before the theft of my data occured on the new card. The transactions are mainly from California but there are some from Houston, TX and Myrtle Beach, SC.  Here is a link of my transactions to prove I'm not a shill/fake account. Its exported directly from my Bitpay account and was sent along with my dispute.
So what are the chances this happens twice to the same person with two different card numbers???? Slim to none. You might have the same likelihood of getting struck by lightning.
You have a data breach or worse an inside job where your employees or contractors are stealing from unsuspecting customers.
I smell a class action lawsuit coming if you don't get this resolved.
I'm over here changing my passwords all over the place, calling other banks and credit card companies freaking out because I thought someone stole my identity and here it was just Bitpay being irresponsible. I literally spent the last week trying to figure out how this was happening getting a dead end each time I called Bitpay.
You folks can say all day that "Oh we don't store them" "It's subcontracted out" "Its not our fault" BUT its your brand on the card so everyone is going to associate this data breach with Bitpay not some subcontractor no one in the community has heard of. If McDonalds has Ebola on there lettuce and ait causes a bunch of people turn into face eating zombies does everyone sue the unknown lettuce grower or McDonalds?
I have no idea how you folks didn't know this was going on for 17-20 days (at least)... My first fraudulent charge from California was on 10/7.

I can confirm this happened to me as well.
IF HAPPENED ON 2x SEPARATE CARDS =(
They gave me the runaround earlier today. It started on the first card on 10/8/2019 and the second "new" card 10/22. Its a bunch of crap. 
Several hundred dollars stolen.

This doesn't seem scammy or anything lol. Here is a random house on Google earth. Who wants to give me $250,000 in non-reversable cryptocurrency with zero escrow protections. 
What's to stop someone from doing an airBNB and posting up a random house lol.

Not sure if all do but some of those ATMs require a phone number for any size transaction then an ID for larger ones. 
I guess if you had two phones # or possibly a VOIP # you might be able to pull that off. Not sure if they are all like that but the company that operates the ATMs in my are requires a phone  digital wallet QR code from your wallet of choice, and then an ID for the larger transactions.

Maybe A LOT of revenue but you then have to figure upkeep, employees, unions(if your in the north), building rent/mortgage, Self employment taxes, workmanship comp, unemployment tax, etc. Maybe 1 out of every 20 skilled trades workers are owners and maybe 1/2 of that 1 in 20 are actually making A LOT of income. 
But to get to a level in which you are making a respectable amount of $$ you need to actually have the customers. Building a customer base usually takes years. Skilled trades make bank don't get me wrong but the owners deal with a fuckton of headaches. Then you need to factor In the uncertainties  of a weak real estate market and poor economy  could easily  wipe you off the face of the earth.
