these trends ive been seeing over the years kind of alarms me
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:54:53
is...is this all you have to do these days to become a star O&gt;o shit man, in that case I'm going all out
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:53:19
if this takes off and goes to 100,000 and above? you are going to cry yourself to sleep every single night O.O trust me
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:06:14
im in it for the long haul!  i will keep buying 20 and 30 dollars here and there each week at coinbase, then transfer to gdax every few months then transfer them to my hardware wallet.  ;) ive already made over 1000 dollars in 2 months with bitcoin and litecoin.  yap! 
I feel this is just getting started too
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:40
i will slowly buy into bitcoin, 20 here, 10 there, 20 here, and all that stuff.  maybe a spurt of 50 or 100 every so often, but im going to play it safe with this.  I DO believe digital currency is the future but it's going to take a while to really grab onto the mainstream.
as soon as you can pay for utilities, rent, food and stuffs with it? THEN we're talking.  I understand it will take time though
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:44:14
thanks for the info! but i know what im doing :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:21:49
i got in about 2 months ago after missing the boat in the past, i already have made quite a bit of money.  I'm going to hodl every single thing.  im never ever selling.  I will keep my hardware wallet in a fireproof safe and every few months transfer my bitcoin from coinbase, then transfer to gdax, then into my hardware wallet.  oh and along with my knife and pistol next to it ;)
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:17:48
that may be coinbase tbh O.o
i know gdax is owned by them but...idk.  i dont like their layout.  i cant see my overall amount :(
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:14:33
i think it will be, i missed the boat in 2010, i should have went into it huge, but i cant look back in the past now.  I'm going hard now.  
it's the future
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:35:12
Concealed bitcoin? Like hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:37
FINE WITH ME!! :D Keep crashing so I can buy more into it! then have it go up after each one of these crashes!
I seriously hope this isn't getting worse o.o  we'll see what happens!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:57:54
why!?! why would you do this to meee!! :( FUCK YOUUUUUUU lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:29:43
either way I think ;)
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:56:36
i keep coinbase/gdax up on a screen JUST for bitcoin now....ive bought a screen from goodwill JUST for bitcoin o.o
what have i become rofl xD
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:57:03

@_date: 2018-09-09 18:00:26
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:38:23
so...can somebody explain to me what that giant ass spike was? why it went that high only to ...mean nothing and come crashing down now :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:28
exactly.  it will go up again, and a lot.  But not as FAST as it did before at all I dont think.  for some reason CRYTO SKYROCKETED!! the past few months like mad.  I kept saying to myself "a big dip is coming,  just wait for it"  O.O  and here it is. Big league
I hope it keeps going down, then I can buy, then it goes up like mad again and gets the train rolling :D
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:12:17
Upgrade your video card while you can. Prices are low right now. Lol 
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:55:50

@_date: 2018-10-16 17:13:24
just bought 200 dollars worth...
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:10:34

@_date: 2018-10-28 13:54:26

@_date: 2018-06-30 05:07:33
Fucking serious?? I need to pull my money out then. For years coinbase has served me well. No problems. Can I see some viable alternatives guys? 
Fuck Facebook 
@_date: 2018-06-03 23:01:24
Nice stalking! People must be fascinated by me. I love it! Oh well. I already have over 2000 in it now and will hodl that forever. I may not put more in but I'll analyze and act based on what's happening. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:41:14
Shut up!! :( don't come down on me!
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:58:51
as with an investing account.  Just gotta wait.  5, 10, 15 years? no problem!! :D
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:37:54
just bought 200 dollars worth again.  I buy at the dips like these ;)
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:57:58
yes! i know all that.  I'm a believer!
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:53:03
I'm going to be rich as fuck. I'm patient. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:19:34
I'm waiting for it to drop more so I can buy and make some more money 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:01:09
I think that spike we saw was an anomaly 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:59:36
oh well....guess i made the wrong thread, man you guys are so uptight cant even joke well.  see ya then :) 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:04:21
fuck this!  god dammit.  i refuse to give sites my social security number to buy bitcoin.  wtf is this shit now?!
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:54:43
thanks dick -_-
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:50:53
and that settles it.  this has made me make up my mind on where to go.  I'm going coinbase coupled with bread on my phone
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:50:34
after analyzing the markets, and how bitcoin has been doing for years, NEVER SELL!!  EVER.  just keep buying bitcoin and building your funds.
I can talk all day about should have would have could have bought it in 2010 but nobody had any idea it would be like this today.  I could have been a fucking multi millionaire, but...I can still be! it's not too late and i feel this is just the beginning of something huge
im buying, never selling
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:08:36
Need...to check....coinbase... At work.  Guys I'll be back. I have to go to the bathroom. Have stomach problems. Yah....
*hears cheering in the bathroom*
Lol. That's me at work now 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:11:45
im going to wait for a dip.  i have decided to go HARD on this now and will NOT fuck myself over by not getting aboard when i wanted to "go for it" in 2010. I have coinbase on one of my dedicated screens up at all times to look at markets a long with other market graphs and stuff.  idk why i didnt, but i was going to invest over 1000 dollars in bitcoin in 2010.  but that was a lot of money to me back then.  nobody knew it was going to be this big.  
But i cant look back i can only live in the now, and the now is....go hard on bitcoin.  i have made up my mind!  the only way to achieve success is by taking big risks.  I'm going for it.  I have a big plan
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:44:33
I'm waiting for a big dip so i can invest heavily into all Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.  I'm a believer of digital currency and the internet is only growing bigger so it's the future of it.  
If i have to wait 5 years to be a millionaire? or even 10? fine with me, I would have to wait beyond that anyway with my online business to even achieve a fraction of that.  so im going hard on this with coinbase as my main exchange and bread wallet for ios
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:34:19
Same 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:25:01
Ok. Thanks for the info. Something weird is definitely going on here then. I'll contact support 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:45:04
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:06:20
OMG THERE'S A DROP!! BUY BUY BUY!!!!
NO OMG!! WAIT NO NO NO THERE'S A SPIKE AAAHHHH WAIT!!! 
NO NO FUCK FUCK FUCK!! I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT WAS THE DIP!! FUCK BUY BUY BUY!!!
WAIT! WAIT YOU DAMN FOOL! IT MIGHT GO DOWN AGAIN! BUT YET IT KEEPS GOING UP GGAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
this is my head when looking at it sometimes lol :P
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:01:45
exactly  wtf??!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:48:29
:( well it fucking sucks! i dont want to upload all my credentials of my driver's license and give them my life's fucking track record.  I really really dislike that and just signed up for gemini, so i'll see how that goes.  seems too complicated though.
:( i want to buy fucking NOW! i dont want to give everybody my god damn ss number and shit.  That's a little too far  
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:23:22
you are asking somebody to read more than one sentence on reddit or the internet....cmon now, you cant do that!
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:35:05
can somebody explain to me why coinbase took the option of putting your cc number in to pay the last couple of days? what's going on there :(
i can put my bank account just fine.  But now i need to upload all this fucking shit to just use my cc.  wtf is going on.  i want to buy NOW i dont want to wait a week for it
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:11:26
Some people have to learn extremely hard ways unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:31:15
This needs to go down. �� I need to buy like a madman. What if... It doesn't crash ������
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:40:37
i believe, in 5 years, you will be a fucking millionaire.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:49:08
bitcoin is the future of digital currency.  paper money is going to be ancient one day and things like bitcoin will be the thing to have.  it will be all instant.  it's much easier and more efficient anyway.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:41:30
that was the joke o.o
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:59:24
Yah I will keep that in mind. But I'm willing to pay some small fees for a legitimate run operation and not some shady ass site lol. 
I have bread all ready to go to transfer. Should I use my cc or bank account for coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:24:04
HIT IT!! COME ON!! DO IT!! IVE ALREADY MADE 2000!!! :D
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:48:21
I'm going to heavily invest in bitcoin and litecoin. I decided against it in 2010 and still kicking myself for not taking the risk. But I can't hold onto the past. Nobody knew it was going to be this big. And it's only going to get bigger. 
I'm going hard on this. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:26:04
that's exactly the same type of talk that "convinced" me back in 2010 not to buy 1,000 dollars worth of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:15:43
im psychic! it will reach 20,000 in the next 2 years.  i guarantee it!!
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:23:35
i cant add any more payment methods other than my bank which takes WAY TOO LONG to get my bitcoin. i dont want to wait 7 to 8 days for my damn bitcoin!  
you cant add more payment methods without uploading all these details about your life now.  they changed it :(  idk what happened
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:45:05
fuck it. im going coinbase.  after analyzing other places, im going to make the decision to go with coinbase and bread wallet on my phone.  i will transfer it all to my wallet and NOT leave anything in my exchange as much as i can.  
anybody else have an experience with coinbase here?  they seem pretty good.  I NEED to buy btc NOW! im NOT fucking myself over again like i did in 2010 by not investing in this.
I'm kicking myself! i would have been rich beyond all measure had i just bit the bullet, took the risk and went in.  i need to do this.  im going in today. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:32:51
i keep telling people....buy now? or forever regret and hold your peace....
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:31:11
everybody say money!! MOONEEEYYYYYY :DD
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:36:43
if it seriously goes to 40,000? o.o i'll be fucking loaded...lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:53:12
just you god damn wait!  bitcoin is going to turn out like that movie "timeless" where the bitcoin hardware wallet is in that vault lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:10:15
That's exactly what people told me about bitcoin in 2010. I'm not listening to any fucking armchair investor anymore. I'm taking the risk. Technology and the internet are only growing.  It's only going to get bigger. 
I'll be a fucking millionaire in 7 to 12 years. I'll just keep buying amounts over time and hold them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:01:32
you think YOU'RE kicking yourself in the ass!? i have to live and cope with the thought that i JUST ABOUT to hit "buy now!" realistically with about 800 dollars worth of bitcoin back in 2010 when it was about 7 dollars for one.....
I listened to armchair "investors" and people told me not to do it, that it will just be that and not go above 1000.  that it was a scam and people would never buy into it. I should have NOT listened! I should have went with my gut feeling which was telling me "buy it! take the risk!" but i was also more immature back then and didnt trust myself fully like I do now.  
Keep in mind that was 7 years ago now and I have grown tremendously since then.  I know nobody knew back then or even in 2014 that it would be this big.  But I would have been able to have all the money that I need to live my life the way I want.  Frugal, minimal and spend my time playing mmorpgs, building communities in them, and just do what i feel like doing.
I will get there eventually, but shit man..think of what i would have if i spent 800 dollars on bitcoin when it was 7 dollars.... O.O  i think of that a lot.  But I cant look back!
I AM NOT LISTENING TO ANYBODY ANYMORE!! i am NOT missing this boat!
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:41:25
By 2025 I'll be rich beyond measure 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:33:27
I'm somewhat going all in. I missed the boat last go around about 4 years ago. I will not be missing it now 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:55:58
im not giving anybody my credentials or even numbers for anything :o you crazy? lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:04:56
Why did you steal my comment :(
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:46:04
if you want to buy, buy now.  stop waiting for it to go below 2000 or something, will never happen again.  the time is now, it will just keep overall getting higher.  Dips will happen, but I'm tellling you, overall the market will go up up up
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:30:02
what the hell does that have to do with what i posted.  also, thanks for the downvote
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:42:10
that is the FIRST QUESTION i would ask if i was ever in a coma...or something happened and i "came to" in 2027 or something.  i would go "whats....the price ...of bitcoin?"
YYYYEEEEEEEHAAAAAWWWWWWWWW lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:50:22
No I would not have. When I choose to invest I sit on the markets I believe will go up based on what's happening 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:00:14
im well aware, which is why im investing smart and not putting in more than i can afford to lose.
this is worth it
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:59:13
fuck you jpmorgan chase!! you sleezebag ass mother fuckers!!!

@_date: 2017-11-19 19:12:03
ask 10 different people where to buy bitcoin and you'll get 20 different answers lmfao.  Why cant somebody just give a straight answer :(
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:55:31
DROP DROP DROP!! im putting a ton of money into bitcoin, lite coin and ethereum! I believe
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:47:39
that's what i listened to in 2010 and 2013 when i was going to buy 1000 dollars worth of bitcoin and i "listened" to people saying it was nothing.
i would have been a FUCKING FILTHY RICH MOTHER FUCKER right now lol.  I'm not listening to that shit anymore.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:32:25
I'm viewing my portfolio now. I have the money in the bitcoins. But it's not going up as bitcoin keeps going up. It's really odd 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:42:37
lmfao!!! good one :D
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:47:50
all i hear all day long are people bitching all around
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:32:32
uh....ok.....who said anything that i'm celebrating O.o im investing in my future and the future of currency.  I will just buy 20 to 30 dollars each week and keep my bitcoin in there.  I'm never selling.  I believe
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:52:47
Rule 1 of bitcoin. Never sell bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:32:29
when i get into it, same here.  I will keep buying buying and slowly have a ton of btc over time, i will never ever ever sell
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:27:27
nop, i bought BTC and litecoin.  10 dollars in litecoin and 50 dollars in bitcoin.  idk what's going on with coinbase.  did something happen? O.o
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:27:45

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:50:30
i have noticed a lot of companies starting to accept bitcoin!  it's slowly evolving to the point where ALL you need is bitcoin.  THIS is only going to get better
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:39:04
agreed, agreed, agreed.  always keep buying
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:16:40

Nooooo don't sell!! Keep it all 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:21:46
thanks for banning a fellow bitcoin buyer :(  somebody is going around flagging my posts for mod removal.  just a heads up all! they are brigading me
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:39:20
I never needed to upload my ss number and other life credentials to buy on there until yesterday. 
I'm not buying anonymously! My bank account and other info is with them. They need to explain why they have done this. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:10:19
With a voice!! Sir, bitcoin has dropped slightly in levels. You may want to take a look and buy. 
Sir,  the bitcoin market has gone up. You have gained 5 percent back. 
Lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:19:27
screw this.  im tired of asking around and get 100 different answers on where to buy.  im going to coinbase and doing it there.  I got nothing to hide anyway.  are they safe?  that's all I need to know.  
I fucked myself royally by not getting on the train in 2010 and buying a fuck ton ...i would be filthy rich right now....im NOT missing this next big thing.  NO.  I cannot pass this up again.
I'm going to put money a side each week to buy some bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:40:22
Please stop reminding me  grrr
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:26:25
ill cross that bridge when i come to it
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:18:05
it will be 100,000 and go up even more!  i guarantee you anything.  bitcoin and others are the future of currency!
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:32:10
trick question...it is always a good time to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:50:07
ill take a turkey sandwich pls!  wait...wtf? why is it .05 bitcoin now?!! that guy got it for .02!!!  
"im sorry sir, inflation happens, it's going up again"
this is bullshit! i want it for .02!!!
"im sorry sir, maybe you can wait another 2 hours" 
2 hours?!! im hungry now!!
"there we are sir, bitcoin just went back down, i will now take your .02 for the turkey sandwich, enjoy"
*old folks look on wondering what the fuck just happened*
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:03:03
you owe me a vid of you eating your left nut.  It will be 100,000 and raise even a lot higher.  I have been analyzing it now for a while.  based on what the world is in, the future is all online and digital currency.  the paper money that's floating around? That's just stuff still all in circulation.  digital currency is going to be where it's at.  Plus, it's A LOT SAFER
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:34:30
rule 1 of bitcoin. always always buy bitcoin
rule 2 of bitcoin. never never sell bitcoin
rule 3 of bitcoin.  always be checking bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:26:13
tell me about it....i was getting into it all and put my cc info in there.  bought 60 dollars worth.  for some reason now they have taken credit cards off and you have to go through a huge process to verify a cc now.  their bank transfers are ridiculous! something happened to them in the past 2 days and idk what
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:34:53
I understand that!  But I should have listened to my gut instead of armchair investors lol.  My intuition told me "take the risk".  No more listening to armchair investors hehe! im going hard :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:07:40
black friday? lol what's that?
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:31:58
I'm waiting for a crash so I can start buying like a madman

dump her! she will just mooch off of you when you become rich in a few years
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:22:11
don't sell!! keep it !! i made the mistake of not buying a fuck ton in 2010!  i regret it but cant look back! im going hard now.  will buy some every week, even if little amounts.
do NOT sell!  never sell!  sit on it and watch it grow over time.  this is just the beginning i think.  i missed the 100 to 1000 boom, i will NOT be missing the 1000 - 10000 boom nor the booms above that that just keep going up and up.  I think bitcoin will just keep getting massive growth over the years
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:29:50
yes....i keep checking coinbase. this is just the beginning of a HUGE boom!  i got my wallet all set up with bread.  i'm tired of asking where to buy bitcoin and did research for myself.  seems coinbase has it's ups but people seem to hate on it for some reason.  im going there and will be smart about things.
I'll transfer it into my bread wallet when i get it all
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:09:52
Couldn't be further from the truth.  But you can believe what you want.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:50:16
buying! FUCK THIS SHIT!! I didnt get aboard in 2010 and i SHOULD HAVE invested over 1000 just like i wanted.  FUCK but nobody knew this would happen.  I am going to just buy and transfer and just let it sit and NEVER EVER sell!  
im going hard on this! i cant look back now! i need to get into this.  I can only live in the "now" and not in the past.  NOW NOW NOW
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:30:20
exactly my point.  remain totally invested.  and keep putting money into bitcoin.  it will pay off huge.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:18:03

yap.  people jumped aboard the crypto train WWWAYYY to hard and fast for the market to sustain that many people and that amount going up up up up up.  the train has now crashed and the cars are slowly piling up behind one another while the weight of them smashes into the next one, the train is VERY long, but the momentum of the crash keeps going.
This is ...saddening to see tbh with you of all my years of watching this.  this is quite a big drop.  I'm not forcasting doom yet, but this is quite a significant thing going on here.
People bought into it WAAYYY TOO HARD man.  WAY too hard and now? its crashing. most people dont understand how markets work.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:19:42
if this were the stock market then yes, I would believe this.  But this is crypto.  It can go anywhere and anytime :o

"this is not looking good at all..."

it's not "done" but it won't be like what everyone thought it will be here , at least for a while now.  People got aboard the train and now they are either "tired" of it or they just lost interest, because it's not being regulated nor can you do anything practical with it in all reality every day things.  It's too volatile up and down plus, it's not being widely accepted for things.  you can't pay many things with it.  i think people analyzed the markets and went "ok, there's tons of bitcoin, but what can I DO with it?"
I think that's where we are right now tbh.  The more i look at these markets every single day.  I'm not saying it will NEVER take off again, I'm saying that people came back to earth and reality

god i love this theme and artstyle and all this.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:22:15
Same. I'm getting discouraged! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:31:00
when people go "it's just a little dip! it's still good it's still good!"
I think of that simpsons barbeque episode with the pig lisa gets out of the backyard "it's a little dirty it's still good it's still good! It's just a little slimy! it's still good it's still good! It's a little airborne...it's still good it's still good!" 
bart - "it's gone"
homer - "i know...:( "

i understand.  but also, try to understand other points of view.  i have monitored crypto for a long time, even though i never invested a lot.  this is...very odd to see O.o
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:24:03
ive lost already 300 dollars hodling from this crash rofl. this shit fuck better go up xD
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:10:16
shush!! lmfao
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:14:03
Hmmmm was wondering why all of the sudden prices shot up out of nowhere. Was too good to be true. Litecoin was 50 cents and 3 dollars for years then all the sudden went to 50 70 90 120 150 180 200. Was nuts. Idk what caused that giant spike for everything but I actually think that it kind of ruined crypto right now in a way where the interest is now waning and the consistency is gone somewhat. 
We'll see what happens. But I'm being cautious and not putting in right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:39:28
newsflash...sadly this is NOT the dip o.o
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:32:53
Ok cool. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:48:13
if i had a time machine, i'd travel back to 9/12/2010 and buy the ever living SHIT out of bitcoin :o
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:43:18
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:42:10
just analyzing what i see man :)  not trying to doom.  just pointing things out.  this is a pretty substantial crash down D: gotta admit that
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:33:23
not likely.  when I decide to go on something especially investing in the future, I am VERY patient with it and would probably let it sit in an account for years and slowly buy more btc over each month little by little.  That's my plan. 
so it's either coinbase which i hear isn't very secure, gemini, bitstamp, itstamp, kraken, coinsnow, etc etc or the swath of others people say.  bitcoin is a thing where you ask where to buy, you ask 20 people you get 30 different answers lol.
I will go fucking hard on this, I have analyzed markets a TON and I can't look at the past of what I could have done, i have to go by what is NOW and the safest way to get started.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:26:25
I'm getting into it now hard. I will not fuck up again!
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:54:45
It will hit 50000. Mark my words 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:26:23
oh fuck you dude..its just a name.  stop picking on it.  as if YOUR name is so fantastic.  fuck off da whistle
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:33:22
time to buy! i believe! just bought 100 dollars worth right now! fuck it.  time to take a big risk.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:48:57
hopefully this is just a little dip here and that spike we saw last year wasn't some fluke.  Let's see what happens
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:18:00
indeed "this doesn't look healthy anymore".  That's because it's NOT! this is a bad thing for crypto....something happened and I'm not sure what.  a total crash would be it going 5000 and below.  I REALLY HOPE that never happens again o.o
something is happening and I think you are right with the manipulation.  I dislike this very much
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:18:51
trump is not going to ban bitcoin -_- just stop that pls
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:28:51
Ok...what does that have to do with anything??
@_date: 2018-07-28 05:34:54
Buy now. Or you will regret it in the future. Hardcore 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:16:01
im a fucking idiot!! AN IDIOT I TELL YOU!! i swear! i was going to buy about 500 dollars worth of bitcoin in 2010 :(  i would be filthy FUCKING RICH right now o.o
idk why i didnt click "buy now" :( i didnt know it was going to be like this though but as successful people say "you have to take the risk to see the reward"
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:28:58
Come down more!!! If it comes down more I'm going to buy another 100 dollars worth :D
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:28:50
Rofl 
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:48:38
If it ever does? I will be rich as fuck. I will cash out and never have to do anything for the rest of my life 
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:14:41
My head hurts from reading that. Seriously it does. Learn to talk Ffs 
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:56:26
oh ffs, give a rest already  ya loonbag.  the "hate trump" stuff is getting quite old now.  He's done more than the past 4 guys combined and continues to do more for the people.  If you can't see that, you have been successfully taken by the media.
It's getting old -_-
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:17:34
can anybody tell me wtf is going on with bitcoin? o.O
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:01:57
it's obvious based on math and data it's going to go up HUGE AGAIN!  NOW is the time to buy bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum.  I'm betting big on bitcoin and litecoin though.  I own 10 litecoins now got some more bitcoin.  Buy now? or forever hold your peace﻿
it will NEVER again get this low.  
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:47:20
i hope it keeps dropping so I can buy really low, because i have a hunch it will NEVER get this low EVER again.  this is the time to buy. you will regret it if you dont get some.  even litecoin.
Anyway, can anybody explain wtf is going on?
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:14:12
buy a shit ton right now...or you WILL REGRET IT!! mark my words...

@_date: 2018-12-17 14:09:40
some people feel like it gives them power over people.  it's very strange.  there are also some people that go around and just downvote for the fuck of it too
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:16:16
yah i know that outcome too :( no need to downvote me though
