Will there be a BCH wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:44:32
I bought in in 2013. Was a bitcoin evangelist for 2 years. Then I just stopped paying attention pretty much completely from 2015 to 2017. Now I’m a happy camper. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:49:58
I’ve held bitcoin in Coinbase for some years now (stupid I know) but does that mean I now have BCH too? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:54:30
Wow. Thank you. I would have found it eventually but I normally don’t make a point of going through all my sign procedures to actually see it.

Meh, building credit is a whole new ballgame and doesn't really apply to bitcoins application. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:42:27
Yes be cause coinbase keeps 90% of there coins in cold storage. A coinbase wallet isn't even a real bitcoin wallet. It's a balance and that's it. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:57:33
Oh ok. Ha ha. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:24:51
I'm not positive how to do that. I mainly buy from coinbase.

Lol. There is nothing dark net about Gox. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:46:23
It's more than providing your email address. Face it. If you use PayPal you have to verify your identity and address and and link your account to a bank card. This is certainly better than giving a strange website your credit card info. Which again is not a seamless process. You gotta type all those numbers, as well as a billing address all the while putting your financial security at risk. Look at the the Target CC breach. With bitcoin you literally click under 10 buttons and you are done. Try it. You won't believe how fast and easy it is. A lot of people. Who hate on it haven't sent or recieved bit coin in a transaction. Good luck.

True. But obviously many people aren't protected as much as they wish. Doesn't insurance only cover up to 250k in a bank?
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:26:39
Even so. I think the general sentiment is that as long as people don't sell it to them, big brother will only increase the demand and the commodity will become a very HOT commodity, giving bitcoin holders tons of buying power. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:57:55
Good plan. Remember 2FA. Probably the most important thing. I prefer receiving an SMS code or phone call. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:05:14
An to add to this, it maks it much easier for a small business. Opening a restaurant is one of the riskiest businesses to open and being able to pay your servers 2 something an hour helps with the costs of running said business. 
On top of that, in our culture, if the server was payed minimum wage, we'd tip anyway.

Better yet. Have a new dedicated email address solely for coinbase. You pretty much never even have to login into it. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:12:38
It's not BS. Apparently you can get money of out Gox but it will literally take more than 6 months at least. As the most popular and biggest exchange, their backlog is incredible. I think the best way to commit this arbitrage would be to have a Japanese bank account. But then you'd have to send money from japan to the US. How much does that cost? 
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:50:08

Why do they deserve it more than early adopters. Those people believed in Bitcoin and risked their own money in something they believed would be a great innovation. They are more like early IBM and Apple shareholders. People who invested in a new technology before it's time. Couldn't you say that supporting innovators is just as important?
I never said the winners should control the world. That is the problem we have . People who are on top DO control the world. This is nothing new. Wealth distribution is lobsided as it should be naturally in a free market. That doesn't mean the betterment of humanity should be delayed due to greed. 
Everyone making the equal amount of money would stifle the innovation that capitalism brings us. The reason why America is the mother of invention is because we live on this bumpy road with despair and poverty on one side and wealth and happiness on the other.

Hey Darkwing. Honest question. I noticed you were trying to sell bitcoins 200+ days ago and people were calling you a scammer.

Coinbase is more of a broker than an exchange. They buy and sell bitcoins. And the answer is yes, you can transfer your bitcoins out of coinbase as often as you'd like. If you are living in the US, there really isn't a better way to obtain that amount of bit coin safely.

No. The belief in a decentralized peer to peer exchange system. Something of this magnitude is against the status quo and there is a ton of resistance. Deep down it is an ideology.

My comment I posted there that I doubt will get read so I'm posting it here god damnit. 
Meh. Bitcoin is fine. We've seen this Gox collapse coming for a while now. We took a slight dip but we are back steady in the 600's. If you bought bitcoin and held them for 6 months you'd be way ahead of any other investment. People who held there bitcoin and money in this seemingly insolvent company deserve everything they got. Number one rule of bitcoin is YOU are responsible for your bitcoin. Leaving it on a website in another country is the same as all those people who lost their money to Party Poker and the likes. In the USA, we have coinbase who have done an excellent job at working with regulators and keeping their asses clean. They even hold 90+% of the coins in cold storage so hackers wouldn't be able to rob them of they tried. This is a new technology. There is going to be hiccups as there has been in the past. This isn't the first time bitcoin has had its obituary posted.

7 “After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.
8 “While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.
9 “As I looked,
“thrones were set in place,
    and the Ancient of Days took his seat.
His clothing was as white as snow;
    the hair of his head was white like wool.
His throne was flaming with fire,
    and its wheels were all ablaze.
10 A river of fire was flowing,
    coming out from before him.
Thousands upon thousands attended him;
    ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.
The court was seated,
    and the books were opened.
11 “Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. 12 (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)
13 “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man,[a] coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.

I am saying its a new thing. Before 30 years ago, you had to write a check each month to pay your monthly bills. Auto charging things like mortgage/ rent and utilities is fine but why should Xbox and free credit report auto charge my card unless I cancel. It's retarded and takes advantage of the consumer. Bitcoin gives the consumer the opportunity to take back that right to pay once with no strings attached. Your credit cRd number is like your public and private key and it is literally posted everywhere. Look at the target data breach for example. 
Have you ever paid for something with BTC or do you just selectively remember the horror stories people write about new technology? Everywhere I've spent bitcoin on the Internet has been the most painless way to pay I have ever experienced. Every charity I've donated to with bitcoin has been very nice. No need to enter any information whatsoever. Just like handing paper money to someone in another country. 
As long as there are shitty governments and shitty banking policies that fuck the people out of their labored wage, bitcoin will do just fine. The applications are endless.

I buy through coin base. Mostly a hoarder although I do spend a few dozen bucks every now and then if it's convenient. Every thing bitcoin related is super simple if you have bit coin. Duh. There are a multitude of paper wallet tutorials plastered all over the place. Due diligence and and some reading will make making your paper wallet easier. 
I'll gladly hear your explanation of what a spread is and why it applies to a free 1M in transactions. PayPal fees are about 2.9% although you can get those lower if you do good business. That's 29k dollars saved by accepting bitcoin. 
I just can't simply understand why you go out of your way to hate it so much. I mean I understand a good argument when I see one but you are raising the same mundane arguments everyone else has for the past 5 years and yet, bitcoin is still here. Does that mean anything at all to you?

I hated how they let the bitcoin nay-sayers have the last word. That prof. William kept on avoiding questions and coming back with price volatility. When they were discussing the Blockchain as a public ledger that can be used for all sorts of other things, he just started talking about the 8000% increase. He is undoubtedly a smart enough guy and it is a shame he is too blind to see or respect the technological side of Bitcoin. 
Secondly, The lady I believe disclosed in the beginning that she had stakes in Ripple. When they asked her if a public blockchain was important for a competing cryptocoin, she ultimately said NO. It's like they had all these wonderful people pep up the lawmakers first with the global benefit of bitcoin only to have it end on a sour note by so called economic experts. If I recall correctly it was these economic experts that got us into this terrible mess in the first place. Maybe if their predecessors had not been so short-sighted, we wouldn't see the economic warfare that is happening in this world. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:29:50
What about internet capitalists? Bitcoin doesn't need to be some kind of political statement. It is a way to make transactions flow easily on the internet and cut out the middle men. Not every bitcoiner wants to take down the FED or their government. People like to own a piece of technology that they can save or spend or give out as gifts. Why does it need to be more complicated than that?

I understand the consumer protection that is the law of the land. How about micro transactions. Instead of having to buy a subscription for the NYT online, you have to using your billing information and are subject to transaction fees. All for one little payment of a few dollars. Give me a bitcoin address, click send and BOOM I am reading the news. The alternative to this is a automatically reccuring payments for something that I may not want to read in a week or two. I want to support the company but I don't want to deal with the hassle of having to cancel my subscription. 
Also, the price of bitcoin is inconsequential to its technology. May be in a bubble right now.

My contribution to the first stupid comment. 
I AM the bitcoin. But when I deposit cash into Bank of America, it IS there right away. Too many bitcoiners trying to use false pretenses to promote the future alt currency. The truth is, they don't need to promote anything. Once people realize there is no trust needed to transfer money across the Internet, bitcoin will reign supreme.

I always like to think cryptos are worth money because people everywhere can have them and as long as they do and accept them for barter and trade, they will have value.

Or do you have a publicity stunt posted to YouTube for the world to see. I don't think anyone really thinks Apple will change its mind over this but if you can use going viral to raise awareness of Apple's anti-crypto stance then so be it. It's not like they are smashing hundreds of phones. By the backlash you'd think they (iphone smashers) are burning down children's hospitals.

Oh I'm not trying to convince you of anything. Make some practice paper wallets first to get good at it. I was just explaining that coinbase doesn't keep their(your) coins online. But if for some reason they go under/get in legal trouble it may be hard getting your bitcoin. By all means you should store your bitcoin on your own. That's the beauty of bitcoin. Just be careful is all.

Thats why you are met with childish remarks because we have seen this shit before. Bit coin crashed because we just cut the head off of the largest oldest exchange. It was a sacrifice and did it affect the price, certainly. Has the price already recovered? Yes it has. If you had anything of substance, people wouldn't  laugh at you for being so narrow minded.

Loan officer here. Only 2 months of bank statements are needed for a loan. Any large deposits or withdraws must be explained. Just because this particular lender saw bitcoin transactions as a red flag, doesn't mean all lenders will. Either way, id say either get a separate checking account or keep your checking account "clean" for a couple months prior to applying for the loan. Also if the loan process is taking several weeks or months, the lender will ask you for an updated bank statement. So your not quite in the clear the first time you submit it. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:33:24
This. I even went a step further and created a whole new email address dedicated solely to coinbase. Enable 2fa on ALL withdrawals if you don't plan on spending BTC often.

Thank you for sharing. The truth is this technology is still so young. It is experimental for a lot of people and businesses. All great things have growing pains.

Millions of people sending half-cents every second equates to excellent revenue. I understand why NYT has the policy it has for recurring payments, that's business. But business changes. Quite frankly, I think people are sick of having their banking information being held captive by companies that want to just charge you to the teeth. Doesn't it bother you that a company that you want to pay money to has a fine print that says they can keep taking money from you. You are opted into giving them this permission. 
in the time before credit cards, you had to write a check and send it in the mail every month. Not very convenient but atleast your checking account wasn't subject to this notion that if you subscribe, you subscribe for life(unless you cancel).
 Bitcoin lets you be in control of your funds no matter where you are in the world without having to pay extrordinary fees to CC companies and other remittance industries. Even if a bitcoin mining fee is 1%, that's still 2% less than CC and paypal. What if you are traveling internationally and want to use your CC. Some campanies will charge you international transaction fees because it complicates their system. Honestly, I think Satoshi was just sick of being charged fees on his money in every step of his life. 
Bitcoin is a programable system that lets people transact without the middle man taking crumbs from your dollar. I am not totally against traditional banking and credit, I just think there should be a digital alternative. Germany called Bitcoin, "Private Money". It's better than keeping cash under your mattress. 
Have you ever watched the transactions on BlockChain.info? People make micro transactions consatanly.

As the bitcoin value rises so do people's buying power. In the United States, we have coinbase.com. It is a very reliable bitcoin broker than buys and sells your bitcoin directly to your bank account via bank transfer. So that's pretty liquid. If they wanted to use your service, they would rather use bitcoin becauSe it is fast and convenient. True believers only switch to fiat if they have to. If you decide to accept bitcoin, you will be adding to the world of the bitcoin economy and saving yourself money.

@_date: 2014-01-29 15:45:15
Okay. Coin base is definitely the safest way. Your going to pay a 1% fee. Set up your coinbase account. Use a unique password and maybe even a unique email address. SET UP 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATON. This should be the first thing you do. I prefer to use the SMS code. Basically a text message you get everytime you try to login to coinbase. Prevents thievery. Then just start verifying as much as possible. Good luck and feel free to ask me any questions.

@_date: 2014-02-15 16:44:16
I think a lot of people were creating arbitrage scenarios. The money was too good to be true. Since it took up to 6 months to get your fiat out of Gox, the price of bitcoins there was often times $150 more then the rest of the exchanges. You could buy on coinbase for $500, transfer the coins to Gox and sell them for $650. The catch was waiting 6 months to get a check in the mail. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:21:25
That's true. But this question is old hat. Coins will and have already been lost. Bit coin is designed so the whole system can literally run on 1 BTC. If anything the lost coins will only raise the value because it will limit supply.

Tacking on so you definitely see this. When you set up your coinbase account, ENABLE Two Factor Authentication. MUCHO IMPORTANTE. You can even enable 2FA for all withdraws from the wallet. Being that you are probably going to be saving your BTC and not spending them, it is wise to do this. Good luck!

This is my post from has the best answer so far. People want a decentralized crypto currency. Now that they have had a taste, they will never forget and will do their best to get their money out of an archaic inflationary central banking system. With things like bitcoin you no longer have to worry about governments coming and taking your money without permission. This hasn't happened in the US but it is happening across the world. With bitcoin, your money is as safe as you make it and can't be accessed by anyone but those who hold the key to it. I like to think of it as a string of code that envelopes the whole world through the Internet. Owning a piece of that string is like owning bitcoin. It is unique and universal. As long as people own it and trade in it, it will not go anywhere. The price is actually irrelevant to the technology.

Digital goods don't require personal information. (Online newspaper subscriptions). In fact I use my BTC to buy gift cards through gyft. My girlfriend loves it when I send her a digital gift card to Victoria's Secret. 
If you can't find out how to make a paper wallet securely and stick it in a vault, you're Internet inept. 
Coinbase charges 1% to get the bitcoin. Big fucking deal. Once you have some everything is much easier. 
When my brothers who live in different states owe me money, they just send bitcoin to my coinbase account. I know painless bank transactions exist but only if you use the same bank. 
Oh yea, I own a business that accepts bitcoin and PayPal. Coinbase offers the 1st MILLION DOLLARS in transactions for free. Sell for for cash that day to avoid price fluctuations.

7 The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, "It will be for a time, times and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed." 8 I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, "My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?" 9 He replied, "Go your way, Daniel, because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end. 10 Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand. 11 "From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. 12 Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the "1,335 days. 13 "As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance."

We differ in beliefs. People mining bitcoin and investing in it put in their own time and effort in something new and exciting. Even they didn't think bitcoins would be worth the $600 it's worth today. Turned out a lot of people saw the need for a decentralized peer to peer unit of trade and barter. Speculators will always speculate and are perhaps the reason for such quick and early growth. I'm not denying that. That doesn't change the usefulness of the new technology. Crowd sourced money. Those college degrees in finance don't mean they should be gauranteed the lions share. After all, machines and computers have been replacing people for 500 years now. We are in the industrial revolution of the Internet. The status quo has never been maintained in all of human history. 
Lets not pretend that all bitcoiners want people with masters degrees in finance or CEOs of major corporations don't deserve their spot in life. Those guys busted their ass but they need to adapt just as much as the cashier that lost her job to self checkout machines.

Nice job round peg. Sometimes when companies have bad policies, it is our job as consumers to put it in the spotlight. Remember when(Or still are) everyone did the bank run and changed to credit unions? Or when people protested Chick Fil A for their stance against gay rights? Oh yea, remember when Reddit had its panties in a bundle over the new Xbox announcement. To be mad about 5 iPhones being smashed as a statement is the real childish thing. "You can donate the Phone" thing is pretty silly. If you can't afford to get the iPhone, it probably means you can't afford the bill. If you live in America, go to T-mobile, they are practically giving that shit away for free. Oh yeah, remember Reddit's renegade against att and verizon in favor of T-mobile. /rant

"That is a lucid, intelligent, well thought-out objection.
No, in all seriousness, that is very well put. If everyone just put their coins in cold storage and forgot about them it would render bitcoin worthless. However, if and when bitcoin becomes mainstream with a steady exchange rate, cold storage would be no better or worse then a savings account. Right now we are in such a tumultuous time in bitcoin where it just isn't safe to have your bitcoins "out" yet. As long as more people get involved and more commerce and exchange of value happens in bitcoin, the engines that secure and guarantee bitcoin transactions will evolve. Hopefully, with light regulation we can see standards applied to these services and the average joe won't have to get an electrum wallet or have their private keys etched into metal and stored in a vault.(This is a titties way to store money btw) 
Until then, I'm afraid, we are stuck in the wild west.

I read it. Why do people assume that bitcoin has to be an all or nothing alternative. People would like a crowd sourced savings engine that hedges against inflation and bad government policies. There are very few ways for the common man to see any significant interest on their savings at the moment. Even worse, inflation makes their hard earned dollars worth less. If you are lucky enough to have a good job and a tax free 401k you're better off, until the money crooks collapse the economy and your saving cut in half. Bitcoin is a new technology that can't be compared to the gold standard. I'm certainly not asking for our money to be based on the bitcoin standard. We are far too young to even begin the fathom the thought of that. As a risk based asset and a remittance killer, bitcoin is king. It is still so young yet so promising. People that say it is broken is like saying a there is something wrong with a baby that can't walk. Nobody is telling you to pay your mortgage in bitcoin.

Freedom of speech absolutely gives you the right to do "retarded" stuff. Destroying consumer products in the name of protest is not a new thing. There have been many notable boycotts. One of them was call the "Boston Tea Party". In a form of protest against oppressive British authority, American revolutionaries destroyed tons of British tea. This wasn't going to cripple the British empire with revenue loss but it did get people talking. Here is a list of some notable boycotts from recent history. 
The point is, if people think that standing up for yourself and publicly smashing (pun) a company that is against their way of life is maniacal or stupid, then we are in bad shape as a people. I'm not saying we are in a revolution against apple but they are a pretty powerful company and quite literally control the lives of a lot of people.

If you send bitcoins to other coinbase accounts does the transaction go through the block chain or does coinbase just do an in house transfer? If that's the case you can immediately negate any in house bitcoin transfers as they are just moving a balance.

Oh it absolutely will be more expensive. I have netflix and think it is a wonderful deal especially because you can share.

Instead of paying a subscription, it would be neat to just rent the series haphazardly with bitcoin. Then again, you could use a cc for this also.

But people like to pay in cash. Lets say I want to go to some obscure website and purchase a digital program. I have to trust that website with both my personal information and CC information. This is risky and is the reason why Paypal was invented. Paypal charges high fees and you need a bank card to use it. 
Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank and make non-reversable, non-recurring payments as you wish. It is quite literally digital cash that you can send in a text message.

@_date: 2014-10-20 21:47:33
This is very old news. Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:13:37
Sorry if I wasn't clear. Companies that are subscription based, hold you captive to paying them once a month. 
CC companies charge the merchant for using their transaction system which is 3-4%. That adds up for a business. I know this thread is about the consumer so I will digress on that issue. 
The beauty of the blockchain is it is a public ledger. So If(when) the government gets their act together, they will be able to see who holds these bitcoins. Most bitcoin owners I believe are honest and don't want to bear the burden of tax evasion. The problem that the government has with bitcoin is it is hard to classify as a commodity or a currency. You don't pay taxes on commodities until you cash them into dollars. 
And avoiding remittances is a consequence of the new technology. The remittance industry has been charging people to use their money for a very long time. Open source peer to peer networks exist to let people have the freedom from a 3rd party. Linux is an excellent example of this as it allows people to avoid microsoft and Apple if they want to. There is absolutely no reason that our wonderful internet shouldn't save us from these industries. Take a look at the charities of the world. While I bet most are honest, they require tons of people and networks to get the money where it needs to go. This equates to people profiting off of charitable donations. Bitcoin lets you send money directly. 
Yes the miners are middlemen, I agree and am sorry for not including that. Although they charge a much lower fee and provide the service of proving that the transaction happened. A transaction that will forever remain public. This brings me to the importance of the blockchain. 
Even if bitcoin as a currency or commodty, whatever you want to call it happens to be wasteful or unpractical, the blockchain and its proof of work system has a ton of useful real world attributes that are yet to be seen. As an example take the subject of Title for property. Instead of having to file it with the government or wherever it goes, You can attach it to a bitcoin transaction that will be there forever for all to see. Nobody can alter it either. It is safe from corruption and loss. 
I appreciate the constructive criticism you are presenting. Most of the anti-bitcoin people here have absolutely no good points. Keep em coming, I like answering.

I think you are referring to a paper wallet. If you are interested in creating one you can search this sub for a good tutorial. Coinbase is an online wallet. If you keep your coins there, you are trusting a 3rd party. Coinbase is probably the most trusted 3rd party in the world to hold bitcoins. They keep the majority of their coins in an offline wallet in bank vaults to keep them from being hacked. It is important that if you decide to make your own paper wallet that you are extremely careful. There is a lot of room for error and horror stories have been told of people loses everything because of a silly mistake or vulnerable computer.

That's fine and dandy and the doge phenomenon did get a fuck load of people into crypto which is good. Any real bitcoiner doesn't see doge as a threat, we see it as a risky investment. Not only in cash but in ideology. What happens if doge goes under? There will be a few hundred thousand people with a bad taste in their mouth when they could have just joined the movement that's been fighting for 5 years and has taken enormous strides. I haven't personally been here for those 5 years but the BTC community has been through hell if you look into the WHOLE history of it. 
When I say these things about doge I always feel like the old financial farts that tried warning me about bitcoin. My advice to shibes: DIVERSIFY. This isn't a war. This is freedom. Not checkers, chess.

Available price data[edit]
The lack of consistently recorded price data from the 1630s makes the extent of the tulip mania difficult to estimate. The bulk of available data comes from anti-speculative pamphlets by "Gaergoedt and Warmondt" (GW) written just after the bubble. Economist Peter Garber collected data on the sales of 161 bulbs of 39 varieties between 1633 and 1637, with 53 being recorded by GW. Ninety-eight sales were recorded for the last date of the bubble, 5 February 1637, at wildly varying prices. The sales were made using several market mechanisms: futures trading at the colleges, spot sales by growers, notarized futures sales by growers, and estate sales. "To a great extent, the available price data are a blend of apples and oranges", according to Garber.[30]

 I think bitcoiners are weathered from fighting for it every single day. The excitement comes during the run ups but when sits at one price for a while we lose the positive spirit that dogecoin is currently enjoying. The people that have been here for a while have had to deal with tons of shit for their bitcoin beliefs. When some noob comes in and asks the same old questions or makes the same old attacks on bitcoin, there is no one willing to be helpful. Well there are some of us but I think a lot of noobs get spiteful responses. 
One more thing. It's nice encouraging businesses to accept bitcoin but I could care less if people don't want to buy it or trust it yet. They will eventually. We are not actively recruiting people to invest like doge does. That type of aggressive recruitment has the signs of a cult or a Ponzi scheme. I fear that the doge people can get burnt.

@_date: 2017-03-10 21:24:01
First of all, for the last 2 years Bitcoin has been relatively stable. There is new peaked interest in it right now so it is definitely bubbling and volatility is high. 
If you want to use Bitcoin as a money transfer or to buy goods, you should buy your coins and send them right away. 
If you accept Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, you should exchange to something more stable right away. 
As long as people can transfer money to one another across borders and pseudo-anonymously, people will always use it. Doesn't matter if a Bitcoin is worth $1 or $1000. That's what you don't realize. The true believers and users of Bitcoin don't care what the price of it is at all. 
As long as the block chain works, who cares. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:16:01
Like I said. It doesn't matter the volume or the price point or the market cap. So long as people want to circumvent traditional payment systems,  Bitcoin will exist. The only thing that will I can see happening in 5 years is a better version of Bitcoin taking the driver seat. Bitcoin could trade at a penny a coin in 5 years but it will still have users. Just look at doge. People still use that shit. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:01:31
What authorities exactly? Bitcoin is worldwide. There have been multiple ruling about it in the US already. You can't stop it. Anyone with an internet connection can mine for it and anyone with the internet can use it.

@_date: 2017-03-10 21:25:49

And btw Bitcoin is 8 years old and has bubbled and bursted numerous times. People like you have called it dead over and over again. Until a better version Bitcoin comes out, it's not going away.

I used to be very active but I have come to realize that we haven't found out what Bitcoin can be REALLY used for yet. The average user has no say In what the developers are going to do with it so that's all moot to me. As long as it doesn't die completely the value doesn't mean shit.

I just opened a vape shop. Ironvapin.com. We do not accept bitcoin yet but will in the future. The hardest part about opening our site was getting a payment gateway. Our industry is labeled as high risk because of the uncertain nature of e cigs in the eyes of the government. This requires us to pay higher rates on all credit card purchases. With bitcoin, no one else is taking the risk but me and the buyer. Just another applicable use for this amazing technology.

Why would they afford you opportunity to go around their system and give buyers absolutely no recourse. They don't even allow you to exchange email addresses over their messaging system. I am a big fan of bitcoin but it doesn't make sense for eBay due to it's one-way nature.

You're not adding an extra step. You are using a different one. However, until businesses can can exchange large amounts of money internationally via Bitcoin, this point is somewhat moot. For example, if a company wants to pay a chinese manufacturer 15k to produce and ship some products, they are going to spend the 40 bucks for the T/T transfer. Believe me it is that cheap.

Probably not. These other people are sour about noobs but everyone is a noob at some point. If you are ready to sit on that money for a while then go ahead and buy a 800 bucks worth. No one can really time the market so waiting for a dip could leave you out in the cold. If you bought bitcoin at anytime in its history and held for a year, you made a profit. So if you do decide to buy, PLEASE DONT PANIC SELL. if you believe in bitcoin you will believe that the price is not going to fall to zero. Take the plunge if you're ready to not use that cash for a while. I bought in at 150 and kicked myself in the ass for a few months and look at me know. Hahah. Still holding out btw. Also there is nothing wrong with taking gains when you have them but if you make it that far you may as well keep a stake in the game. Good luck. Make sure to secure that shit when you buy. Nothing worse than seeing someone lose their bitcoins becausE of a stupid human error.

Sorry. We check 2 months of bank statements to make sure that there is no suspicious deposits coming into your account. We do this mainly to be sure that you are not taking out a secondary loan to cover a down payment as this would conflict with the loan we are giving you. However, a source for a large deposit can come in the form of a gift from a family member. Example being, father gives son 50k to put down on a house.

So bitcoin is the same as one company offering gold backed online currency? Clue in buddy. Bitcoin is open source and not some scheme to rip off consumers..
From wiki:
e-gold was a digital gold currency operated by Gold &amp; Silver Reserve Inc. under e-gold Ltd. that allowed the instant transfer of gold ownership between 1996 and 2009, when transfers were suspended due to legal issues. e-gold Ltd. was incorporated in Nevis, Saint Kitts and Nevis with operations conducted out of Florida, USA.
In 2007 the proprietors of the e-gold service were indicted by the United States Department of Justice on four counts of violating money laundering regulations. In July 2008 the company and its three directors pleaded guilty to charges of "conspiracy to engage in money laundering" and the "operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business" in the U.S. District Court for D.C.[1] The company faces fines of $3.7 million.
As of November 2009 the company's website states, "As e-gold Users are aware, by agreement with relevant authorities including the U.S. Department of Justice, e-gold has suspended all e-metal Spend activity subject to meeting certain licensing requirements. As a result, e-gold Users have been unable to engage in any transactions, including exchanges, that would require either receiving or making an e-metal Spend from the accounts they control. We are, however, working diligently to develop a means by which account Owners will be able to access the value in their account".[2]
As of December 2010 the company states that refund policy has been approved "We are pleased to announce that we have finalized an agreement with government authorities that will permit owners of VAP-Qualified Accounts to be paid in U.S. dollars their proportionate share of the monetized value of the e-metals in such Accounts"

If it went down to 10 dollars then that would mean bitcoin would be dead and another better crypto currency would exist. Face it. People like the freedom bitcoin offers. I don't blame you for not buying. I think it is artificially inflated for our time frame but 1000 per is a baby step on the grand scale. Bit coin has many other uses besides being an investment vehicle. As long as people are sick of banks and fiat currency, they will buy bitcoin. You really have to think of this like a brand new Internet. An Internet of money. Nobody had any idea what the Internet would do but look at us now.

Bitcoin's early days facilitated illegal transactions over the Internet. This included selling drugs without having to use actual money for the transaction. Nowadays the bitcoin has soared in popularity and more and more people are using/accepting it. The bitcoin Is as groundbreaking as the email as it allows people to send money to one another over the internets without any middlemen(banks, PayPal etc). The implications of this are huge. Imagine your traveling abroad and run into a bind. You ask your family or friends back home for some money and instead of them paying all types of transfer fees, they can just instantaneously send you cold hard cash. You can plug in your own scenarios but I like that one because it shows how much more connected it makes us as a people despite the distance between us. As the the investing part of your question it pretty much comes down to supply and demand. The beauty of bitcoin is it is a fixed supply. Since there are only so many bitcoins that can exist, the value of each one will be greater as the demand for them rises. You can speculate all you want on what the price will be but the general consensus is that no one really knows or they will be worth a ton of fiat each or they will be worth nothing. That's for you to decide. Personally I'm rooting for the 1000 dollars a bitcoin prediction. Also a major taking point in the bitcoin community is that the governments who are controlled by the central banks of the world don't like bitcoin. It is a serious threat to their dominance. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:01:24
Thanks. If we were face to face id poke holes in those holes you pointed out but it just really isn't worth trying to convince you. Just one sentence though. Not all bitcoiners want to be anonymous and people are fed the fuck up with our bailed out banking system. I think people root for BTC because it gives the people a chance for once. I agree, people could lose their shirts but those people need to learn to never put your eggs in one basket.

Despite some popular opinion, Bitcoin isn't mainly for illegal transactions. It is an alternate currency and most people involved aren't a bunch of tax cheats. We just see that money should evolve just how everything else in the world has since the internet. Here have some bitcoin.

Yes it rises with media attention simply because it brings smarter people that can get behind a global, open source, peer to peer, deflationary and decentralized currency. When we start seeing a run up the bitcoin becomes a speculative vehicle for investors and wishful day traders. As soon as one whale cashed out a few tens of millions of dollars, panic sets in people who actually believe in the bitcoin protocol either panic and lose sight of their beliefs or they simply just want to take their gains when they can. Hang tight it's going to be a fuck of a roller coaster.  Remember, if at anytime you bought bitcoin and held for one year, you'll have made a healthy profit.

Well. It's like paying with digital cash for now. There is no chargebacks with cash transactions unless you get a refund from the vendor...Chargebacks are certainly an excellent consumer protection measure but it can be abused in a multitude of ways. If two parties agree and the product is exchanged, bit coin works great. Essentially no fees. No regulations on who you can and cannot give your money too. Imagine how much money the middlemen in this world take out of the pockets of the consumers and sellers. It is astronomical. PayPal charges a fee of up to 4% in some instances. Bit coin lets you make digital purchases without the middle man. That's the pudding. I'm not saying it won't improve and also everyone that loves bitcoin doesn't necessarily want to see the dollar and consumer protection of credit cards go belly up.

Think of it like a unique string of code that exists on a global network of computers all running the same protocol. You can transfer your unique string of code throughout the network and subsequently, throughout the world. Bit coin is not controlled by any one authority and is pretty much open source anyone to use and improve. You cannot replicate a bitcoin and only 21 million can ever exist. Have no fear though, each coin is divisible up to 8 times and they say this decimal can move over even further in the future if the 'miners' all agree. 
So in closing, it is not really fake money. If anything it is more than or just as real as any other fixed amount commodity. As long as you believe that the Internet is here to stay, then there is nothing to say that bitcoin or other crypto currencies aren't. 
Some analogies I've heard about bitcoin.

Be your own bank, credit card, PayPal and Western Union.

Correct. Don't think of it as selling it. It's trading two types of currency. I'm pretty sure the sidebar has a list of places to buy bitcoin. I used coinbase but have heard bitfloor is pretty good too. You've got more work to do as depositing cash will take some effort. Also, I have no idea what will happen to the value of the bitcoin so buying is either a great idea or a terrible idea. I have no idea.

If you truly know the risks involved than I say trust your gut like you did last time. Bit coin doesn't seem likely to go belly up by this time next year. That being said, maybe risk less? 25k as opposed to 50. Just talk to a tax man about all the potential tax penalties you could face. Not worth speculating without a professional opinion.

That's a terribly weak argument. Why won't you share the information? Id buy it if I could buy it with bitcoin. Do you know how many scholarly journals there are on bitcoin? I'm not going to spend 5 bucks for some guy to tell me that bitcoin is in a speculative bubble which may be true but our support structure is growing. People who really believe in the tech welcome speculators as they bring money and attention. It's going to take time for things to stabilize. Anyone who acts like BTC isn't a risky investment is nuts but believing in it doesn't make you so. The more you learn about the protocol and the endless possibilities, the less you will want to pay David Stern $5 for financial advice. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:14:34
They are semi centralized in that you have to get them from An exchange. That doesn't have anything to do with centralization of money. Coinbase doesn't print their own bitcoins. Hell, they don't even mine them. Fiat exchanges are way safer as they have government regulation. No one ever said BTC wasn't a risky new technology.

No. Everyday users of bitcoin. People don't want the exchanges to get shutdown. They want some sound regulation to keep there bitcoins safe. Imagine if you had 1000 or more bitcoins. Government regulation would help secure your money. People aren't afraid of paying taxes or giving up their identity. There are ways to stay anonymous with bitcoin but I think the majority of users aren't concerned with that. You have this attitude that its some kind of anonymous anti government thing and that's the bullshit that ruins this community.

After Hurricane Sandy, we were without power for 14 days. If businesses were able to open, they could only accept cash. I remember 711 was open but their credit card systems were down. So unless you had cash you were pretty much SOL. However, after 3-4 days we had cell service and 4g back so the bitcoin cold have definitely helped us out.

Perhaps this is one of the reasons cash will always exist. If small business had a ledger of all their transactions, they'd have to pay full taxes.

Lender chiming in. We need to know where your funds are coming from. We check 2 years of tax returns, pay stubs and 2 months of recent bank statements. If that money was just sitting in your bank account from before we started the loan process, we could care less. It is important to have it in before hand though. If not the bank will think you could have taken out another loan. A way around this is to have a trusted family member give you a "gift". Basically give them your cash and have them write you a check.

Ok good luck. Be sure to pay your taxes.

You can't buy bitcoins with credit cards. Read about reverse transactions. Coinbase dprs direct bank transfers of you are in America. Local bitcoins is like the craigslist of bitcoin. You can meet and buy with cash. Be careful though not all people are trustworthy. 
There are a ton of sites that accept bitcoin. Someone has made a list of them somewhere. Gyft.com sells gift cards for some major retailers for bitcoin. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask away.

Short answer: nowhere. 
Credit cards have a consumer protection feature that lets the user do a reverse transaction in case of theft and fraud. How can you ever prove that you sent or received the bitcoins to the credit card company. Most people that somehow sell bitcoin with a credit card get burned. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 17:08:33
I think the price is all relative. The perks of a crypto currency make it so the price isn't really going to matter if you are using it as a currency. You can purchase any quantity of fraction. Maybe one day that pizza will cost .00005 BTC.

Why does the Wikimedia Foundation not currently accept Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a form of crypto-currency; in their own words, "an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world."(Bitcoin P2P Digital Currency. Retrieved 2 November 2011.) The Wikimedia Foundation's position on the matter is as follows:
    The Wikimedia Foundation, as a donor-driven organization, has a fiduciary duty to be responsible and prudent with its money. This has been interpreted to mean that we do not accept "artificial" currencies – that is, those not backed by the full faith and credit of an issuing government. We do, however, strive to provide as many methods of donating as possible and continue to monitor Bitcoin with interest and may revisit this position should circumstances change.
The Wikimedia Foundation does try to make donating as easy as possible, however. For a list of ways to give, see Ways to Give.

Nice dude. Like this other guy said. Sell half and make your money back or just sell intermittently as you need it. Big news in bitcoin lately. You might decide to keep some. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:57:48
You've got to look beyond the financial norm in the world. You really have to learn what bitcoin is. Imagine an open source secure currency that can be  bought in almost any denomination and transferred from anyone to anyone digitally and instantly, like an email. It is the future now. Bitcoin also has a lot of competition (altcoins). If you don't understand what it is, than I advise you stare at the bitcoin market for a while. In your studies in your investments class I think it is important for you to grasp the whole picture and consider all crypto currencies for the sake of knowledge. Good luck. Don't drop the full G. Or do.

Do you think bitcoins are going to fall off the face of the earth? They're here now for good despite the price. The price is irrelevant to the technology. Wrap your head around the big picture. People have a unique, non replicatable medium of exchange that now exists forever on the Internet. They don't get deleted like a reddit post. Whether they're worth $1 or $100000, they still have utility. If anything you're the speculator.

Coinbase is a broker. They own coins that they sell to you directly. Things like Mt Gox are exchanges. You trade bitcoin for fiat on an exchange with other traders. There is a hefty sum of information that creates the price difference.

Well they could come out and say they are illegal but will that stop the bitcoin economy? I don't think so. They made drugs illegal and they became more lucrative and expensive. God knows we don't need a war on bitcoin. 
My point is, even if they were made illegal, the Internet still exists so bitcoin does too. This is not the mention that it won't be illegal everywhere so other countries will benefit while we ban hammer a growing technology. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:42:52
No value? Empowering people to be their own bank with a deflationary currency and the power to bypass visa MasterCard PayPal and western union fees. That's not valuable? Any business can ditch that 3% credit card transaction fee by using bitcoin.  
Look bubbles do happen. Are we in the midst of one? Probably maybe but as long as people keep buying we will keep rising. Bitcoin mini crashes atleast once a day sometimes dropping a couple hundred dollars in minutes only to have them all bought back.

They have a low supply and very high demand right now. The volume of people buying bitcoins from them is most definitely the highest they've had. They have to protect themselves. I've bought from them in the past with no problems and even had instant purchase before they implemented the credit cArd thing. The hype train is crazy right now and everyone and their mother is trying to use coinbase. It's definitely the least complicated. Try your hand at local bitcoins. Pay cold hard cash in person. Do your research first though. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:37:55
Or how about a live bill embedded into the table at a restaurant. No need to wait for the waiter to ask for a check, then wait for him to come back and take your credit card away and charge it. Just scan the code in the table with your phone and boom. No more waiting for lost waiters.

Because the BTC turns into dollars instantly and uses whatever the conversion rate is at the time. Same as using your US debit card at a European restaurant. The equivalent depending on the exchange rate is exchanged.

That's why I am making my brothers set up coin base accounts and get their banks verified and enable 2fa. They are into it but are just lazy. So if they want to redeem their bitcoin gift, they have to set that up. No pressure to buy, I just think it'd be nice to be ready when the time comes.

For what it's worth, if you bought bitcoin at anytime and held for a year you made a profit. The pure potential for 8 bitcoins is rather great. There is a senate hearing tomorrow concerning bitcoin that could bring some good news. Your son was certainly not reckless to take this risk. Prices will dip and recover. It's just the nature of an evolving global currency. You should check out the side bar and learn a bit about them before you ground your kid. A lot of smart people have the opinion that it is a good investment. If anything make him sell some to buy a car but let him keep a stake in this.

Yes I have. Zero content whatsoever. He says it's a speculative vehicle the acts like Internet stocks in the 90s. The problem with that comparison is that they are STOCKS! From companies that really can go belly up. BITCOIN IS NOT A COMPANY AND BITCOINS AREN't STOCKS!

Everyone's got their own purpose. It doesn't have to be some anonymous secret money to buy drugs with. It's a good store of value and a great means to bypass visa and MasterCard. If I were using bitcoins to do something illegal, I'd buy them cash on craigslist or LB.

Im certain there are people today with million dollar ideas that will make it much more convienant. Be patient or create an easier way. I've seen several posts suggesting Peer to peer systems that would make trading as simple as me trading you money for bitcoin via an escrow account and vice versa. I think if it gets easier, the price will go up and they will be used more as a currency. Remember your not investing, youre buying in.

The way we are rising at the moment signify a bubble. Last bubble went from 20 to 266 and crashed down below 100. We are starting from a 150ish base this time. It really is tough to tell when it will burst or if it will at all. If it does you want to buy at the bottom.  So the answer is it is up to you. No one is gonna tell you yes or no.

If you are looking at a significant loss just remember, you haven't lost anything until you sell. Historically people who held their bitcoin for just one year have seen extreme profits. I remember the guy in the April crash who convinced his wife to let him put their life savings in at the peak of the bubble at 266. Subsequently he posting some terribly depressing stuff about not being able to look his wife in the eye, etc. I think she made him sell at the low of $60 or something like that. If dude man bro had just held out for 7 months, he would have seen ridiculous gains. I'm no financial expert but obviously don't risk money you depend on on something so revolutionary and if you do just know you might have to wait a FEW freaking months. Big whoop. If you knew the game you were getting into this crash would be laughable at best and seen as a buying opportunity. Do you really think bitcoin will go belly up and flatline at 0? If so then why did you invest in bitcoin? One of the most oppressive governments in the world put regulations on something that represents freedom and power to the people and you are surprised? 
Sorry for the rant. If you are looking at a loss, just regroup and study more about the bitcoin and the protocol. I know it always has me convinced. One more thing, bit coin is 600 bucks a piece?!? Holy fuck, that's a beautiful thing.

It is safe to assume that people are speculating, but that doesn't mean that people don't believe in its potential as financial utility. I think a lot of people start off by speculating but as they get into it more and more and begin to understand what it is, they see it as so much more than speculation. As long as I can use my coins to communicate/transfer money freely, I don't care how much they are worth. If they get cheaper, I'll just get more.

I'm not opposed to better alt coins. This technology is in its infancy. You can't create a global economic movement over night. There will be thieves and criminals.

I bought at 150 during the last crash and kicked myself for it as they stuck around the 100 mark for a while. Now I realize that if you really want these things to payout you are going to have to wait several years anyway so fuck it jump in. Obviously don't spend more then you are willing to lose. Don't panic sell if they start crashing. These things are just bumps in the road. I remember reading some guys who been bitcoinjng since the beginning say there will be 4 or 5 great bubbles before bitcoin can stabilize. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:27:07

I know this argument sounds old hat but everyone of those drugs is available in every town in America for cold hard cash. If you think bitcoin is going to bring more drugs, than you obviously don't understand how big the drug war is. Do you have any idea of the sheer amount of cash involved in it? You think everyone on here cares about bitcoin solely to be anonymous and avoid taxes but that's bullshit. If you haven't ever had a problem with a bank or a credit card than maybe bitcoin isn't for you. I for one am not a fan of Bank of America putting a hold on my checks or charging me over draft fees. Why gives those crooks more than you have too considering what they did to US economy. Ill pay my taxes just like someone who runs a cash business pays theirs. Because not paying taxes is the dumbest way to lose your money.
