Eh? Hows that trolling? It was a perfectly reasonable reply to iceblademan saying how more people should understand the origins... Meme&gt;Child porn.

I contacted them a week ago. [Their response](

What's tipping if you buy $50 of coins to tip, but then only end up tipping $5 because of the value loss. We don't take crypto as serious as bitcoiners, but we also have fun. It's not greed, it's upsetting to see something you've worked hard for to lose value...

+1000 doge there you go buddy, enjoy! 
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:51:53
That's my favourite, cheers! 
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:03:30
Yes! 
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:53:50
The difference is, you don't get 80,000 users blindly using altcoins... Our subreddit has shown more growth than any other cryptocurrency out there.. You don't get blind faith working on that scale.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:31:00
I'm extremely sorry that you have been treated like this! Hopefully it was only the minority treating you like that. +2500 doge
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:26:54
Totally get that. But it might be difficult to  attract non tech savvy people if they don't want to spend time in a non friendly environment?
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:51:37
You're so mad it's hilarious.
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:05:53
I missed this: What happened? Can anyone give me a summary, or elaborate into detail if you so desire to!
@_date: 2014-07-31 09:21:29
I think Imgur have said many times they're planning to start accepting BTC
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:46:32
So are you saying you expect the price to drop even further? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:02:51
I'm just saying, *I think more people need to understand the origins.*
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:10:50
Wait... In the US are PIN numbers not used in store when purchasing goods with debit/credit cards?
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:16:57
As a long term user of dogecoin, that's what made it successful. Not the technology, but the community. We need this in Bitcoin for major success! 
Edit: Long term, as in I was there basically since the start… You can't really get longer than that? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:01:08
Why? 
@_date: 2014-06-05 07:58:53
Preludio.io is lovely
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:07:33
I already spoke to them about this a week ago.

We don't post about Dogecoin in Bitcoin unless we just see plain bashing of our coin... If we started bitching about bitcoin in surely you'd get a load of Bitcoiners over there defending their beloved coin? It's just depressing, I am so anti all the hate between the coins. I wish we could exist in harmony. Plus, I think it'd be fair to say that nearly all hate towards other coins comes from the bitcoin subreddit? We don't rip on other coins for trying.. We respect it. The only thing we don't respect is when other coins try and steal our achievements and label them as their own (ShibeCoin)
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:11:43
It's hard to think of Dogecoin as a joke when it's worth at least $47,000,000. The fact that it is not as serious as bitcoin, the fact that it may seem "jokey" to you, is what attracts thousands of people to it... A lot of major, multinational companies have realised that being having a too serious, formal persona is putting off average Joes... Its the same within the cryptocommunity! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:19:19
So just copy the wallet.dat file onto my SD card? Is that it? And then what do you mean multiple back ups? Just put the file in a load of places?
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:21:21
Totally should come along, enjoy the party!
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:21:50
Shit. That sounds really risky. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:19:56
[I thought you already transferred your Dogecoin]( You're just playing the anti-Dogecoin circle jerk even more... 
@_date: 2014-07-31 09:49:32
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:18:13
I sensed a fair bit of sarcasm..
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:59:48
Hahahaha, Arcurus, you're the dude. The BTC community are clearly shocked, and don't appreciate this happens reasonably often on ^^
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:42:28
Absolutely brilliant! Honestly, this dogecoin widget is a beauty.  Thanks a lot! :D +100 doge 
@_date: 2014-08-08 19:58:56
Hey people at OB.
Have you ever thought about running a kick starter? One where you accept donations in all types of currency? You could use some of this money to develop the infrastructure of the site, or just so you guys make money full time whilst working on this?
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:34:13
Hugs would be nice, but from the overall feeling I've got from this post it seems that's out of the equation.
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:10:57
Ah that's insanely helpful, thank you! So if i were to lose my wallet file, but had my private key, could i still keep my bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:39:49
:| It just feels like their is an obscene amount of hate towards altcoins like Dogecoin on here, for no apparent reason, I guess that's when I get upset.  +5000 doge verify
@_date: 2014-05-24 11:28:21
I don't know if this is of interest, but the creator of dogetipbot is working with the people at twitch to intergrate a dogecoin tipbot. I reckon a bitcoin one is going to be inevitable. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:03:54
What about all the people within this thread just abusing Dogecoin? All the down votes proving people dislike dogecoin? Surely that is hate..?
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:09:40
All generalisations are false. 
Just kidding, of course, that was a joke. But seriously: Dogecoin has been extremely fun for me. It got me into cryptos, I ended up buying Bitcoin as a result of buying Dogecoin. The price does matter, of course, people aren't going to use a currency if it's dropping by the day. If the price was constantly low, that's not a big deal, but it's the fact that the community is tied to the value that is a big deal. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:41:46
No offence, but our origins seem 100x more positive than the origins of bitcoin... (Although not intentionally) it was primarily used on the black market for buying drugs and child porn. Perhaps that's why Dogecoin is a lot more attractive to some users... 
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:00:03
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:37:46
God damn, that's awesome! I'm from the UK and just watched the ground breaking episode where you know what happens... holy fuck.
Edit: (I'm basically crying)
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:14:29
Sorry, but why do you think anyone cares that you traded your Dogecoin for Bitcoin? Like, perhaps if you traded millions of doge, but you traded less than $4 worth? It just seems like a massive circle jerk. What sort of "tips/tricks" do your really expect from people..? Go spend it? Keep it? Wow, that was hard...
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:50:23
What is Satoshi's original bitcoin address? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:19:42
That statement made me happy. Thanks a lot. I don't know how much 800 bits is worth but have this +3000 doge verify
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:43:09
Actually I got the verification this morning! My very first bitcoin spend, very impressed.
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:01:23
Woah, chill out Shibe. The BTC community are pioneers and we need to respect them. They have proven to be kind and generous, look at what they did for Dorian Nakamoto!
@_date: 2014-05-10 12:52:31
Hi, forgive my ignorance, but what is the point of these? Are they just like places you can back up your digital wallet? If so, why not just use a memory card? Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:32:50
Oh shit! Was this the dude that did that to Andreas? What a tit.
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:39:30
If it was 100,000, how large would the market cap be?
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:59:05
Big ups to my Bitcoin homies yo! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:15:57
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:15:49
Thanks! sorry being retarded, cheers!
