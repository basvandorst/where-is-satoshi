A "high class", edgy joint that has USB dongles sold by the bartender preloaded with a base purchase price for the stick (to cover the cost of the stick if someone were to just walk out with it) and the currency on it and a QR code address to send more to it?
I'm sure some entrepreneur out there is already on it.
It'd probably just be easier (but maybe less fulfilling) if the performer of choice had a tattoo of their address.  Or two.  Or three.  Or twenty-five thousand, three hundred and seventy two.

Edit: Yup, you were.  [This]( is what prompted the closure.  To be fair to you, that shouldn't be a thing.  Unfortunately for you, it is a thing.  As others are suggesting, credit unions may be more to your liking.  Though, it's always safer to: 1) notify your financial institution ahead of time before making large deposits/withdrawals so they aren't immediately assuming fraudulent activity,  2) deposit/withdrawal in smaller amounts so not to raise suspicion, or 3) have multiple accounts and spread out your funds so it's less suspicious.

That's the problem: people are too fixated on wholes.  Fractions are a difficult concept for people.  The value raises and we'll fraction off more and more until it reaches the smallest divisible fraction (Satoshi).  So - at least for a very long time - the divisible currency is easily adaptable to any demand to sustain enough constant flow of currency.
It's an elevated concept - being this is a new form of currency - to think that fractions can become the new standard, instead of the whole.
I personally think it's magnificent.

@_date: 2014-09-11 06:31:12
Wrong.  Alt-coins aren't what drive BTC's price.  BTC's price is driven by good and bad news stories, regulations, acceptance by communities, use by consumers and merchants - supply/demand.  **Alt-coins are directly tied to BTC**, so I can't fathom how you can think this is even closely true.

Competition is so diluted right now, I don't think it's even a factor.  This is the point.

That sounds like an issue with your banking institution flagging the test transaction incorrectly.  I'd talk to them.  Then contact Coinbase to see if they can discuss the matter.  Coinbase is a legitimately registered business with FinCen and there shouldn't be any issues regarding their transactions.
For the record, I've been using them since 2013 and never had a problem.  Getting an account setup requires a lot of staging processes because of the official capacity and grey area bitcoin is in.  As a fair warning, I wouldn't expect quick resolve for something of that nature.

If that's the case, then the value of crypto would skyrocket because of the widely accepted demand.  Remember that there's a limited supply, and if everyone needs to use it, then the value will raise dramatically.

No.  You're only taxed when a commodity is exchanged into a currency.  Holding does not constitute gains, because you're technically not gaining anything until you sell.  Once you sell, you will then report the gain, which is taxed.

No worries.  I'm no expert, but from what I understand it's treated the same as investment earnings, which you'd report on your 1099-DIV.  I have not actually had to do it yet, so someone else that has may be better suited to give you additional insight into how that process works.

This episode (as they always are) was great.  It was an interesting combination with the release of [Politico's article with mining demands](  That was a particularly interesting read and touches on the uglier side of crypto mining that is mostly ignored in this sub.

Well, simply going by market cap, it's 0.2% right now.  So, prepare yourself!

Then you run the risk of not maximizing your gains.  You also run the risk of not minimizing your gains.  Selling a little at a time - as you suggest - would minimize your losses (or more succinctly, average your gains) due to averages of a fluctuating market, but to each their own.

Or it just proves you can't prove anything.  Precognition is a fanciful dream many desire and none acquire.
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:23:07
While that is outdated a lot of the points are moot (scaling), the only take away I can gather from it are coins that are premined and only have a portion of their total available should have the withheld amounts not considered so the market cap isn't artificially inflated.  This would basically destroy Ripples market cap, and the like.  Then we'd have a more valid measurement of what market cap represents.

So, what you're saying is there is no large investing in cryptocurrency and there aren't cross integration what-so-ever between crypto markets and stock markets?  Uh huh.  Sure.
They aren't isolated markets.  People that are invested in one market are definitely capable, willing, and actually investing in the other.

Because you're missing a crucial step in the process.  When you buy something with bitcoin, it's actually processed by a money transmitter that converts it to cash that pays the vendor.  At that point it's realized.
You're forgetting that bitcoin is not recognized as a legal currency.  It's recognized as a commodity.

Instead of coinbase, you can login to GDAX and set a buy amount.  Granted, you'll have to watch the market, but that $2.00 that Coinbase is charging you is for the convenience of not having to manage that yourself.
That's something you'll have to decide for yourself: which is more valuable to you, your time or your money?

Stocks can't *functionally* be a global currency though.  Applying stocks/investment logic to cryptocurrency - while generally good advice - isn't exactly the best logic, either.
My point?  This is a divergence from normal investment into a territory that the financial world is both uncomfortable with and incapable of controlling.  I wouldn't really hold those financial axioms as truth.

Initially I invested into BTC with the thought of holding, primarily because I believed in it.  I've done so, except recently when I sold a small portion to net gain on my investment.  Now I can rest assured - even if this awesome experiment on social economics comes to an explosively tragic death - I have absolutely zero reason to be disappointed in my decisions as I've already profited.
From here on out, I can hodl comfortably.  I recommend you do the same.  That nag you're feeling will be gone.  You'll regret selling it when the value of BTC rises, but we all do anytime it rises simply because we didn't invest earlier or with more.  *That* nag will never go away; don't kid yourself that you could make it do so.

You buy something with bitcoin.  The money transmitter converts it to fiat.  Tax is applied and included into the total.


No, because they don't convert bitcoin to fiat to ethereum; it's a direct exchange rate.


You can google, or ask them, or read their FAQ.

I think it's safe to say the resounding advice is to net equal your loan investment.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:22:08
You're getting caught up on semantics.  The bottom line of taxation revolves around when anything is realized.  Trading one commodity for another doesn't realize any currency gain.  When you sell back to USD, then it's realized and then it's taxed.
You could literally "trade up" forever and ever and never realize into USD and not pay any tax.  However, that also means you have no USD.  You're just holding a commodity.  Until you sell, your commodity doesn't have any value realized, so there's no reason for the government to tax it.

This may seem like heartless advice, but it's very, very important; **for everyone**.  None of us know when we'll go, and if you have investments, always make sure that it'll be ready to go to where you want it to go in the unlikely event that you're no longer around.

Litecoin has been touted as a likely replacement (among many others) for BTC for a long, long time.  I'm not saying it's not, but the public's investment has to swing that way, and well...it still hasn't.  So, take that for what it's worth.

It's garnered severely large amounts of investment to warrant trust.  It's also lived through several "death" events.
It's predictably reliable and rationally explainable in that it's been tarnished and hit with FUD more times than easily memorable and still gaining overall traction.  It's a slow growth formula; one everyone should appreciate.
To me, all of this says that its ideology is holding its ground.

Yup.  Public interest is just barely focusing on BTC.  What makes anyone think that another crypto-currency will take its place?  People are very stagnant to change unless there is blatantly abundant force making them take that next step.
All of these alternate currencies certainly have some (or more) merit to them, but that doesn't matter if the public is barely on board with BTC to begin with.

I would only advise liquefying (a majority) into BTC if you have options to use it as a currency.  If you do, then you won't be hurting yourself too much.  It's still very much an investment and not quite a currency in a lot of markets, so that is entirely up to you.  More power to you if you want to help its functional value be realized locally though!

@_date: 2017-05-09 13:44:48
All of the awesome jokes here grinned, I feel that it currently has too much capital invested in it from many different sources, private and public, to possibly crash.  I also feel that it would take a lot of major/large governments banning the use of it, and a lot of FUD in large markets to really make it crash.  We've had so many set backs and the price continues to climb due to engagement by different markets.
Crypto is just climbing out of its infancy.  In the grand scheme, its usefulness is only just barely starting to be realized and that's what's really promising.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:58:18

It's far, far too late in the game to bother mining now.  It requires a vast amount of investment to even get into it now, and that's a tremendous risk as opposed to just buying and holding.
