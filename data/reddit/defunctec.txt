This is my personal opinion, but yes 0.3btc should be enough for a 14 year old. I mean if bitcoin survives the test of time by the time you hit 18 that 0.3btc should be worth much more than $180. 
21mil btc-2billion internet users and rising. All bitcoin needs to do is survive.

BTW, any purchases under $600 doesn't need to be reported.

Bitcoin will succeed regardless of what political ideas someone may spout. The political arguments are unavoidable, its a global currency with 1000s of potential game changers in finance and governance. I understand where you are coming from and agree with some things i just think the comments and ideas arnt going to stop coming, so just get used to it.

Ill be honest, yes there has been some bad news, but the good news has way out weighed the bad. Like you say, hundreds of millions in the past two weeks devoted to start ups, master minds of tech and finance are investing their own time and money into btc. Btc is 50% less from its highs, 0 damage to the network, the 0.9.0 update brought fixes to TM. Bitcoin imo is going cheap.

James d'Angelo's youtube channel helped me out big time! I think new comers would learn allot from being directed to his channel.
My understanding of bitcoin and the tech its self is medium.
