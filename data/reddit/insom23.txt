and what will the transaction fees be on a $100,000 bitcoin?

keep talking as it slides all the way down to 7k and beyond

Even with two factor authentication? How likely is it that I would get hacked?

How is blockchain? I don't know much about wallets and that's the one I've chosen because it can hold Ethereum as well

Okay, thank you for your help. In case I decide to go with a hardware wallet, is there one that you would recommend?

And there's nothing wrong with feeling that way. Bitcoin is a fantastic investment because it has so much momentum and hype, but as a functional currency for anything more than small person to person trades and such, it's quite poor currently because of how volatile it is.
This is quite different from investing in a company that creates the iPhone. The value of Bitcoin is rising because people are investing in it, not because of its functionality.

And that's great, but fundamentally - why would you pay for something that you can pay for in your own currency in Bitcoin instead if you believe the value of that is going to double or triple or more in the future?
The whole point of a currency is that it's relatively stable. 
Maybe in the period where Bitcoin was smaller and for a few years stable, yes there was a much larger segment of people just using it as a way to pay for things, but I believe this new wave of people who are coming in from $5000 and for the foreseeable future are seeing it ONLY as an investment.
So I think it's quite silly for the OP to post a graph comparing the growth of Amazon and Apple to Bitcoin, where the previous two made products that were successful and grew the company in that way, where the exploding price of Bitcoin is directly tied to the massive wave of people investing in it (I'd say 99% of whom see it as purely an investment).
I'm not really trying to argue that it's in a bubble though, I think it could keep climbing for the next few years quite steadily. I just think you're mistaken if you think this surge of recent buyers driving the price up are interested in using it as currency.

I think the problem is that for what is supposed to be a currency, there are actually so few people like you, compared to so many who view it purely as an investment.
That's how I feel, anyway.
