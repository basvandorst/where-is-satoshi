I understand the HODL - I am too. I understand going long on BTC - I am too. 
I also understand I should keep my mouth shut and not give investing advice. I’m just some guy. 
When I told him to sell BTC was at $14k + and it felt like it was going to dip again. It’s now at $13350. So - I’m not always right - but BTC needs some good news to pump up again. Without it we will dip from $12.9 to $14k everyday.  Highest around noon. Mornings suck. 
However, he bought low - and stood to make 12% (roughly - without going back and looking at his numbers) if he sold when I said. Fine - all good. I didn’t expect him to do what I said. But I expected him to read it - to plant the seed to look elsewhere. 
I’ve been watching XRP for a little more than a year. Their plan is different than BTC - and I knew that if it DID catch on - it would catch on fire. It did - and than it dipped.  It was at 2.40 its now at 1.90. Potential for profit on a $500 investment is much higher with XRP. If it was 2012 - a $500 investment in BtC would be incredible today. 
I play. I invest. 2 different things. I play with XRP. I invest in BtC. I am one of those believers. 
If he sold BtC and bought XRP - made a profit - waited for another dip in BtC - bought BTc - that’s the game. 
Don’t play if you want to go long. That’s all good. Invest. 
But the 8000% profit days are over for BtC.

Don’t feel bad. You can use the loss against capital gains next year to pay for the trillion dollar tax cut that we ALL lost our shirts on this year.

I wish I knew the answer. I’m taking half out of BTC when it goes back up to $18k and putting it in XRP. 
The other half I’ll let ride long term. I should probably go buy some Rogaine 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:37:39
Don’t sell.

My coinbase ticker said LTC was at $0. 
I was literally considering transferring into LTC and XRP after the bounce back - this thought is bouncing around my brain as I am drywalling my house - 
And I pick up my phone and see BTC at $13.5 (up $2k) and LTC at 0. 
Alright. Plans can wait. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:25:05
There are dift ways. Transfer from your exchange to a  one that sells XRP. Sell BTC there. Buy XRP. 
Example - You own BTC on coinbase. Coinbase doesn’t sell XRP (but when they do watch the price of XRP go through the fkn roof). Open account at Bitstamp. Transfer Btc to bitstamp. Sell BTC. Buy XRP. 
Also - XRP is in a dip
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:23:46
Don’t worry. It will go down to $11k and than to $9k and back up to $20k by April.

It’s a sound investment. Dodge retains its value much better than Honda. And they are very rare cars - so they will be very desirable and profitable in the future - if you can find one.

You raise some very interesting points. These questions have been floating in my head for a while. Trying to quantify the futures price of BTC is the treasure hunt of our generation. 
If you can accurately predict (with a margin of error of say 10%) the price of a coin in a certain amount of time - it is like decoding the lottery and cashing in anonymously. 
I am sure some actuarial statistician has figured this out. Maybe as a PhD thesis or some 170IQ figured it out on a midterm question while the rest of the class was stuck at X=A^2 + B^2
Just need to find it. Or where the predictions came from that hitting $100k are not in doubt. Did they figure this out? Or just speculate? $100k is Almost a certainty in the community. But when you throw numbers out like $1M = 1BTC people aren’t filled with certainty - they are filled with skepticism. It’s almost unbelievable. 
But YOU are right. It doesn’t matter what we believe. Numbers don’t lie. If I told you in 1880 to hoard your gold, or in 1929 that the value of a dollar would be a fraction of a fraction in 2018 of what it was back in the Great Depression - you wouldn’t believe me. But the numbers don’t lie. And all the little steps the world has made forward and backward since 1880 and 1929 have had certain and everlasting effects on our economy. That part is undecodeable - but with proper perspective and a few jumps in reasoning - we could get close. 
For example - what if North Korea invaded South Korea? And America and Japan and China just say fuck em. Now - Korea adopts BTC and suddenly this thing is now a THING. 
BUT what if they adopt ETH. OR LTC. or shit - the USD or EURO. What impact would any of those have on the price of BTC. If a global economy adopts LTC instead of BTC - I don’t see it propping up the price of BTC - I see it hurting it. 
Personally I don’t see how BTC (at this point) can be a store of value or used as currency. It’s just unfeasible.  You walk into Bestbuy or Costco and buy .2 BTC of TVs and computers, go home plug it in and realize it didn’t cost you $3000 - it cost you $30k. Oops. It cost you $3. Nope. $10k. 
So - the real question is - at what point does it become stable? That is the price it will remain - regardless of  trading or speculation.
 Once we all agree that a loaf of bread cost .0001BTC and a pound of Ribeye cost .0002BTC - that’s the price. That’s the price in Kenya, in Japan and US.

I just transferred to bitstamp from coinbase to load up on XRP. No problems there. Just waiting for a 5 cent dip. Funny to say that out loud when I lost thousands in the past day with btc 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:06:16
And it was free to transfer my btc to bitstamp. So don’t worry about eating your profits. 
Btw - congratulations on buying in a dip. You are already smarter and luckier than most.

You can buy on Bitstamp with a credit or debit card if your issuer has 3D Security. I don’t know what that it. So I have been using workarounds. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:45:06
You sound like you legit know what bitcoin is about, though. 
It is a confusing time. I want Bitcoin to be a system BESIDE the system. But now banks and the wealthy 1 percent own a shit ton and it’s just a “digital commodity” where they can buy and sell futures like corn or cotton - but to me (us) it is the ULTIMATE middle finger to the system. 
A system designed to enslave people in debt. 
That is why I am afraid this jump is just banks buying 100billion worth of bitcoin over a time period of 4 months. Just dumping money into it - and waiting - to screw everyone. And than the ride is over and all the people who were skeptical will say “ I told you so” and the believers (me) will be fucking pissed - because I ain’t selling. 
Fuck it. Let it ride.

I’m so scared this is being led by banks.

It all depends. I dont own crypto and consider selling on a day to day basis because the market is very quick to respond to breaking events. So, on the short term it seems too risky for me to bounce around.
 
but on the long term - it seems like a sure thing. especially for people who understand it and believe in its meaning on the world stage.
the day when will come when the masses of people will decide if 1 bitcoin will equal $1million. Without them - we never get there.
so these early peaks and valleys and just the faded and hard to see squiggly lines in 100 year value chart
