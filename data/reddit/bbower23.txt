as it is such a large exchange, for some reason i feel like they shut down for presidents day weekend

I think the higher the price, the more resistant it is to drops and rises, to the point where a 100 dollar drop would be minute in the value of the currency. In that case, bitcoin would definitely be adopted

my mom didnt when I first got in, but now she knows. She didnt care
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:37:24

this is the bubble speaking
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:03:12
us a debit card if you have it, or use a parents card. Its completely legal, but use coinbase for ease of access being young

its just proving the alt bubble

so I should also move away from Mycelium?
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:39:20
ive decided thats what im gonna due, the small untaxed profit will be nothing compared to the 100,000's I earn after tax
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:17:19
we've barely seen a dip yet
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:30:48
so im safe on mycelium bc I have the keys
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:03:36
But if I earn under a certain amount on bitcoin I don't have to file taxes on it, or is that wrong
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:28:34
do I need a server to be able to have a copy of the coin?
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:49:44
yeah, im 15 and can buy on coinbase. Sadly i cant anywhere else, so its my only option, i just transfer the btc to mycelium.

Ethereum and other cryptos may find some success in niches like business usage and speculation investments, but nothing will surpass bitcoin as the day to day future of currency
