this test site is provided by our users, and they tested the speed in this site is often over 20 seconds.
I also can't understand why the speed we tested is huge different with users', and this is my problem.

What's you're question about sterling? 
You will be able to deposit sterling into our system and you will be able to buy and sell sterling on it. 
Some of our core services are free (payments user to user and user to merchant, for example); others will involve a fee. That fee will be denominated in BAC.
You can buy BAC from the market or earn it by providing banking services to others within the system. This is true Crowd Banking.

Of course.
