exponential growth. sing it people. We'll reach all 21 million bitcoins before 2020 
@_date: 2013-06-10 22:34:04
Right. I would follow that logic as well. Zerocoin,Tor and I'm sure other new inventions will patch that right up. 
It's a virus, its like file sharing nothing can be done to stop because it can be saved anywhere (wallet file) I could upload it on Mega.

@_date: 2013-06-05 02:16:23
they're are many trading strategies but Bitcoin bots use EMA (exponential moving average). As for the price of Bitcoin its supply/demand but economists aren't sure why prices go up and down exactly. (stock market, non bitcoin)

There is only one crypto-currency and Satoshi is its' prophet!

P2P exchanges would open up, people can sell bitcoin through craigslist or in person or on Tor. What about Zerocoin? That will offer complete anonymity. I think if governments created an internet I.D law then you would have something. I could sell someone a paper wallet in cash too 
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:47:31
I think Bitcoin will attract the attention of Wall St when it hits $1000 per Bitcoin. Because by then it will be rivaling commodities like Gold and Platinum. Once Wall Street not just Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, see Bitcoin for what it is. 
I believe Bicoin will rapidly race to $100,000 and it will be a very messy place for most of the early adopters. Many early adopters are simply not street smart enough to see how the game works. Pumping and dumping alogn the way will dishearten many people, and I think the people left standing will be bankers. 
Now I know some will expose whats going on and hold on tightly to their Bitcoin and try to fight back But...Honestly Bitcoin started a fire , and it will be used as a tool. A sucker is born every  minute. Take advantage of this unfortunate reality. and profit then jump ship later. 
Lets not play hero, we're royally screwed. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:42:57
my point exactly. read what you just said "NAME SOMETHING BITCOIN CAN'T EVER DO!" like its God or something 
@_date: 2013-06-14 23:22:17
I use an EMA bot for guidance, it's very accurate. Bitcoin will be trending lower for the hours to come it will dip under $100 briefly so buy then. BY morning it should be over $100 again.

If you're in this for the money you're in this for the right reasons. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:47:04
we haven't dipped below our initial phase, the "despair" phase is a huge dip, Bitcoin has never gone back down to $10. So no I haven't noticed anything

"There is no bit but Bitcoin and Satoshi is its prophet."
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:01:05
It answers a problem that Bitcoin has, which is slow transaction time. Other than that, its just another crypto currency in a pool of beta testing.

LMFAOOO!! It's true! I'm having my doubts about Bitcoin as well, I mean Occupy was P2P. And by the way since when was fucking sitting down like bums a form of protest. When they got beat up instead of fighting back, they became self righteous and said "we have to cooperate wit the authorities its the only way to gain support"....BITCOIN IS DOING THE SAME THING ITS BEING REGULATED. 
BITCOIN LOST. ITS OVER. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 19:14:49
Bitcoin will be replaced as long as this logic of "regulation makes Bitcoin more legit" I for one believe in active resistance not compliance. Why?! Why the fuck do we have to register a currency that the state didn't invent, it doesn't even actively invest infrastructure to help it! 
@_date: 2013-06-10 23:44:45
True. I didn't see it that way. Yes in that case it would make business more difficult to conduct. Unless its done through Tor, but brick and mortar businesses won't be able to wiggle their way out. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 04:44:25
That's the painful reality of the situation. On another post I called for Bitcoin to not give in like Occupy did,into appeasing authority. Unfortunately Bitcoin wouldn't achieve its full potential using that method. Ripple as much as I hate it, is more hopeful. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 19:10:21
Why does the state have the right to tax something they haven't even issued or created? I don't understand the logic behind why they even believe they have the right to control any aspect of Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-06-13 02:09:41

Does this take advantage of arbitrage 
@_date: 2013-06-10 22:14:23
SO they just caught on to this? They're really gonna have a hard time swallowing Bitcoin. Of course its going to be used for tax evasion by some people and nothing can be done about that. Paper wallets, bitcoin laundries. its an international currency I can walk across international borders with it without anyone knowing.

@_date: 2013-06-07 23:57:13
yeah, it does. Because exponential growth and Moore's law guarantee Bitcoins cryptography will eventually be broken. By the early 2020s a computer will have the same raw processing power as a human brain.

Who knows, these fascists are insane, they'll make a crypto-currency specific law and ram that shit over night through congress. 
Once or IF these meta exchanges like Kraken and Crypto St open, that'll attract big money and then its going to be direct action. Bitcoin holders better have the stomach for this. I'm not sure I do myself

Crypto-currencies are still in beta. This is an experiment which ever works the best from the pool of cyrpto currencies will be a competitor in the 21st century. 
Bitcoin is speculative, but speculators are everywhere and they help absorb risk. 
The wild prices is just the result of libertarian free market capitalism. It's wild swings are the result of it being new, as it hasn't found a fair stable price the market feels it should be. This is because infrastructure is being built around it. 
In the future Bitcoin or some other crypto currency will have stabilized because the market will have found a fair price. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:33:04
are you on anti-depressants? why is this being posted over and over? Worst case scenerios etc Shit Bitcoin hopefully will make us rich? Because being rich is good.

Just eat wild weeds, you don't even have to farm once you own land. Look up Markuz Rothkranz free living 101. Anything a honey bee pollinates you can eat. You can pretty much just have one staple and buy lots of bee pollen. Bee pollen provides all the nutrients you need minus B12.

I'm encouraging a discussion, the reason I haven't inserted a problem myself is because it will simply encourage "debunking" rather than true reflection on behalf of the larger community. I'm only one mind. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:24:18
I worry about the same, but It doesn't seem like price manipulation, there would be nothing to gain from it. Big money would make far more pumping and dumping...I don't what do you think?: And Bitcoin, for now its stability is fine, but it won't last, think when Crypto St opens and Kraken and other exchanges come online.

We need bigger money. Wall street money. We need Crypto Street and Kraken exchanges to open FUCKING NOW. 
The banks won't stop shit, they'll be busy printing money. Crypto currencies will become easier to explain and use for the average Joe. Computers used to use command line. by now they're tablets even kids use them. 
Bitcoin and other crypto currencies will have infrastructure built around them to make them much easier 
There is no way out..Fiat has failed...

Then on another note, is there anything besides drugs etc that is suppressed that can be sold easily by accepting bitcoin

Note to Libertarians:
As a New Yorker I know the consequences of not having government funded infrastructure. For example NYC Subway stations don't connect because private companies were competing with their own train lines, and didn't want to connect with competition. It remains a problem to this day.
I believe America needs to dismantle the constitution and start all over again and adopt the Swiss constitution. I think its far superior. It provides freedoms, but keeps in mind that direct democracy is superior to representational government. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:16:35
I have to agree. We price Bitcoin in fiat. There is no need to do so in the future. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are mediums of exchange in their own right. Merchants will price goods based on what they think is fair, not how it translates into dollars. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 19:27:11
Cypto currencies will pave the way for a new form of wealth storage, transfer etc. The word commodity, currency, and community were made to explain something.

Gox Trading Bot (Tobli) for Chrome. Everytime I make my own moves without it I always end up losing. It's accuracy is excellent, it never failed me, sometimes you have to step in to buy low because it waits long sometimes too long to buy in and you don't make as much cash.
@_date: 2013-06-10 23:47:10
Yeah, that would be the price to pay. Bitcoin won't have to 'die' just like Silkroad is still around , but it will still be a fringe movement and won't reach its full potential. 
IF more events like Cyprus happen in more places, and economic downturns then I think it would have enough support to sustain itself underground

technology has a democratizing effect. There is no conspiracy for Bitcoin, agencies will love it. I have access to Harvard classes thanks to MOOC. Bitcoin is going to work, cyrpto currencise are cash cow. 
3-D printing will improve things too. It's not too good to be true its progress. Bitcoin will relieve some inequality, not all but its gonna help
Its ok to be an optimist its ok to see things for what they are. Be happy we're gonna be rich.

True, they may all simply become a speculators tool. But keep in mind that WoW gold has no purpose or use for the global population. Remember the demand is global transfer of money with small fees quickly. In addition much the global economy is at whim of a few, human reason is feeble and susceptible. to corruption.
Crypto currencies provide mathematical certainty, security, and require no faith, no revolution to give them value. It's a matter of demand. The more corrupt the bankers become the less faith in fiat currency. There is a shortage of gold as you know. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:25:43
I know that. its true. the banks are seriously robbing the people. What I'm saying is he's just hijacking something and I guess twisting it into his advantage. 
Also I'm pointing out the black and white thinking in the Bitcoin followers (including me). 
I didn't like my line of reasoning and I'm looking to correct it. I have to look at Bitcoin objectively. IT IS NOT PERFECT. SO LETS PICK ON IT. LIKE GOOD CRITICAL THINKERS
