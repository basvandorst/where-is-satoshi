Again...I am a Bitcoin noob, and somebody more knowledgeable might help more, but this transaction was relayed through two I.P. addresses, whatever that means:
This can, of course, be totally useless information. As somebody mentioned below, the money was sent to a bunch of wallets. Tracing it to a single person will be extremely hard.

Confirmed. I got it also. Thanks!

I don't know much about bitcoins, being new to the madness and all that, but can't you trace the transaction origin and source through the I.P. address or something?

That's spray painted? Bah...I wish I could have even half of your talents. :(
As for story time, well, I first learned about Bitcoins in 2011 while browsing through through the deep web. Completely dismissed it as something of use only for illegal activities, even though I foud the idea of a crypto-currency very intriguing. I still don't understand the mechanics behind this currency. But I finally bought 0.05 BTC when it was at $300. And I am not letting go of them!!!

MtGox is one of the oldest ones currently in operation. It opened in 2010

You probably used the bitcoin-qt client and stored it in your hard drive. Do you still have the same computer from back then? Have you formatted it at any point? Do you have the data backed up in an external hard drive? The wallet won't necessarily be called wallet.dat if you renamed it.
