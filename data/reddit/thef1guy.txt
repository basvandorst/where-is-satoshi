3-4 devs. No wonder its taking ages. How can other devs join The Lightening Network? We should have like 20 devs on this full time atleast given the urgency.

Because for most of these kids, that's their whole saving. Am down $25k today and couldn't care. Am hardly even checking anymore. This is long term investment, we get it.

Am no troll mate. Look at my post history &amp; see how that corresponds with my username. People can have a different opinion you know. That's the whole point of  Reddit

He was outed and after that his place got raided by tax agents. Its a case of managing the situation by coming clean and stop the endless investigative journalism or people poking into his business. That's what he is trying to do. 
Now back to the "paid trolled" jibe, you really fucking believe that? Did you even take a look at my comments history as I asked? You think I'll spend 99.9% of my comments on a sporting subreddit only to show up on a bitcoin one? I saw an article on BBC tech section about the topic, read it, came over to this sub-reddit to read more community reaction about it and saw this post, gave my opinion on what I think and suddenly am a paid troll?

They hate him because he's not what they expected. In their minds they built this godlike figure of some Japanese dude with some intent to change the world &amp; commerce. Turns out its a bloke in Australia who just wants to be left the damn alone. So its common backlash. Whilst all the evidence does support to show it is really him, they won't accept it. Which I doubt Craig cares about anyway
