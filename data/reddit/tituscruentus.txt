My thoughts exactly. Maybe you hate bikers/bikies, but eventually, they'll do this to each and every "group" in turn. Apnean and others in Aus need to stand up for these guys, or there will be no one to stand up for you when your turn is up.
That doesn't mean condoning *already illegal stuff* that they do/might have done on a case by case basis, but definitely it's important to stand up against *categorically discriminating against them at all times* like that.

It's effectively the same thing - Bitcoin in the hands of centralized banks will almost certainly not retain many or most of the benefits of the technology.
E.g., Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin if only huge centralized banks are allowed to use it (by draconian anti-competition regulations).

This, people here are just out for blood at this point.

Performing as designed, then... BitLicense is an obvious bid by large financial service companies to shut down BTC before it can compete.

Personally I feel like a better precedent could be set by denouncing "BitLicense" altogether. 
It's clearly an anti-Bitcoin technology designed to create a quagmire of ever-shifting legal responsibilities for Bitcoin businesses, so that NY regulators can defacto declare Bitcoin activity illegal and thus shut down any BTC business they decide to target, with total impunity.
I think it's quite a shame that the Bitcoin Foundation is embracing BitLicense, given that it amounts to nothing more than a scam designed solely to damage legitimate BTC businesses.

Can confirm this works fine, games don't get removed if they're from region free keys.

It neatly kills any BTC financial services that would compete with the huge banks, and basically criminalizes any companies that attempt to do so. 
No one will reasonably be able to navigate the ever-shifting quagmire of legal consequences that BitLicense creates.

It's more like a train running straight for a black hole 300 yards away, but with a critical section of the bridge made of earwax, sidewalk-gum, confidential Fed budget reports, fingernail clippings, and crusty jizz-socks about 200 yards away. 
So the train will inevitably bottom out and destroy the bridge and itself long before it ever crosses the event horizon of the black hole.

Translation: Startups without the backing of huge corporations are intentionally being shut out of the process via massive fee.
