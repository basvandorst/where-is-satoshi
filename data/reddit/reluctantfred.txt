Yes, indeed, I made a spelling error as many others have pointed out before you. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to point that out and not responding to the subject matter of the post whatsoever.

No problem. So what i’m taking away from this is that even though the largest pools are chinese it doesn’t mean that they get all their hashing power from within china. There’s no regulatory threat like Chinese government forcing a 51% attack by coercing the miners into it in some way or another? 
Thanks for the response and answering my question.

Point A) taken. 
Point B) sorry for typo. Used auto correct. English is not my first language.
Edit: i guess what i meant with pool was more like mining farm. Is there any way of knowing how many independent miners are contributing to a pool or whether it’s just one huge mining farm that can be controlled by a single person (or entity)?

I get that miners won't sell at a loss but that doesn't mean they will keep running their operations? If the business of mining isn't profitable anymore - they will hodl their coins and shut down rigs. The question is really: If the miners stop mining, is there any macroeconomic reason why demand should increase as supply declines?

Please elaborate. What do you predict will happen if for arguments sake the price stays at $7200 up to and through the halving. What % of miners will keep mining at a loss?
I’m asking out of genuine curiosity. I don’t know what miner’s profit margins are.

Really, I didn’t know that. Do you have a source? How did mines keep doing business?

Clickbaity indeed. I find his videos in my suggested feed and i cringe every time during his intro. But imho he is quite knowledgeable and i feel like i learn something from each episode despite the cringeworthy clicks and desk bumps or whatever else he’s doing.
