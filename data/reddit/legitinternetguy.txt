These are mainnet transactions
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:25:55
600 sat, as per the title of the post.

Two steem vouchers from bitrefill, some play transactions with friends, and like 20 to satoshis.place
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:54:31
Ah ok, yes you have to commit a sum that will be used on the LN by first sending a transaction in order to open a channel.

That bch is "centralized sock-poppetry" amongst other things. He writes blogposts that are super interesting about the history of money etc.

You can't write IOU's and have them be completely trustless though. Settlement happens when you close the channel but really there is no need to go on chain for small payment like these, whenever I have used up all my satoshi in the channel I send a onchain transaction to a service that sends me btc on the lightning network. I only use this wallet to spend.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:29:37
Amount of transactions on lightning will have no affect on price of opening or closing channels, only on chain transactions will affect that price
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:58:30
Well bitcoin cash does not have lightning network so you would have to do all transactions on-chain, based on  fee estimation the average BCH fee right now is 0.08 usd, multiplied by 42 would be about 3 dollars, or 61 times as much. you can most probably get it for less than 0.08 usd per tx but the fees would still be in the multitudes of LN's.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:23:32
Sorry, I don't use bitcoin cash so don't really know too much about the fees, thats why I said it would probably be cheaper because 0.08 seemed high, still with the 0.0068 usd per tx it would have cost 0.28 usd, or 5.8 times as much. Plus, you'd have to wait for confirmations on chain while LN allows you to completely trust instant transactions.
Edit: Not to mention that I could have done 100s more transactions and significantly lowered the average cost of I just happened to only have made 42 here.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:18:52
20 dollars to open a channel? the cost to open a channel is the same as the cost of sending a BTC transaction. Its the same thing.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:52:38
Yeah, there are a bunch but the cool part is that we don't have to give up any decentralization of the network, also LN scales way beyond what any coin can at the moment.
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:16:07
Isn't it just rounded to the closest satoshi? &lt;0.5 sat = 0 sat when channel close and &gt;0.5 sat = 1 sat when channel close?
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:58:42
Not while keeping same level of decentralization. Also Nano cant scale to Lightning level, LN could theoretically handle around 3.5 million transactions per second today.
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:27:04
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:03:56
If you deem a 0\-conf transaction as a transaction then it is instant but it can still be double spent, LN transactions can't be double spent.
Were not talking about on chain transactions, the question was "how much would this cost to do on BCH" and I simply answered the question with the information about fees I could gather, then I calculated the total fee with the fee you just gave me. I could also have made 100s of transactions on LN for a few hundreds more satoshi and lowered the avg cost by as much as I wanted, there is no way to beat that on chain.
edit: ah sorry I understand what you mean with the fees and dates. still I opened my channel about a week ago and the fees were about the same, even if the fees went much higher I can still make unlimited transactions until it is more economical than BCH unless BCH fees fall to 0. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:05:16
Although you first have to spend bitcoin before you can receive.

I'm guessing by "addresses" you mean nodes since there are no addresses on the Lightning network. I sent the 42 transactions to 5 different ending nodes, my transactions were usually relayed by 3 hops, here is an example:
Node ID: 03864ef025fde8fb587d989186ce6a4a186895ee44a926bfc370e2c366597a3f8f, channel ID: 577246903160668160, expiry delta: 144 blocks, routing fee: 0.010000% of sum + baseline 1000 msat
Node ID: 026da67c0675f1140fdec27a59e734af7a3a73e39de772fa20bab7c143d0b6ab33, channel ID: 577252400739713025, expiry delta: 144 blocks, routing fee: 0.010000% of sum + baseline 1000 msat
Node ID: 03e50492eab4107a773141bb419e107bda3de3d55652e6e1a41225f06a0bbf2d56, channel ID: 578699358051762177, expiry delta: 144 blocks, routing fee: 0.250000% of sum + baseline 1000 msat
I did 42 transactions to  5 different receiving nodes: Bitrefill, Satoshis.place, and three friends.

I don't really know what you mean by everyone needing to commit, could you elaborate? When I open a channel I decide how much to put in and only I decide when and where to send it since I am always in control of the private key.
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:27:35
Bitrefill and satoshis.place

If bitcoin is valued the same as gold one coin will be atleast 320k. I believe bitcoin will be more popular and attractive than gold in the coming years. People value scarcity, we are moving into a more digital world, simple as that.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:52:42
Interesting, but I really fail to see how LN is not trustless? My definition of something being trustless is that I dont have to trust anyone, nobody can steal my coins, I keep control of the private key, it doesn't matter who is on the other side when the coins are sent they are sent. 
Would you care to explain?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:10:03
Bitcoin is probably one of few coins that have a finite supply and such a low amount of issued coins, hence the high value per dollar compared to others.
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:25:08
im not saying it has a use case im just saying that is how sub sat payments  work.
@_date: 2018-07-01 11:38:54
yeah but if I open a channel, route 0.1 sat once and close it , there wont have been any satoshi paid offchain except for the on-chain transactions fees. If I would have sent 0.5 sat there would have been a 1 sat difference when I close the channel.
@_date: 2018-07-09 18:52:23
not in this version
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:26:26
I wish one of those were mine
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:13:44
You can't recieve lightning transactions to eclair right now. I have a mobile wallet that is in closed beta that is able to but it requires you to have sent btc from it first in order to fund the other side of the channel. This will all be way easier in the future with watcher nodes.
