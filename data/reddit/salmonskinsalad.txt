The bitcoin standard was written by a guy who believes meat production isn't bad for the planet

Yeah I've been following him on Twitter for a while because I'm a hodler. This guy is a lunatic when it comes to meat. He believes the conspiracy theory that somehow people made up the fact that meat production produces greenhouse gases. He tweets multiple times a month about meat production. You wanted me to back up my claim, so I searched Twitter for " meat" and this is the first result, posted an hour ago. He linked a video of a meme with subtitles that aren't the actual translation of what the guy is saying. I know he didn't post that video as proof of his viewpoint, but I would expect a smart person not to supplement their viewpoints with crappy conspiracy memes. 
I have a degree in conservation biology so I've put years of thought into this topic and would love to discuss with you why he's wrong. I just worked in Peru alongside peruvians trying to protect rainforests and i've seen firsthand the effects of cattle ranching (deforestation, habitat loss and fragmentation, extinction threats for thousands of species) and how we are powerless to stop it unless we eat less meat and listen to science-guided reform. 
I'm not gonna label him as "something bad" but clearly this is a guy who has trouble identifying what is and what isn't misguided information. He's not a bad person just because he went down a conspiracy rabbit hole, but now I don't trust his analysis on other issues.
