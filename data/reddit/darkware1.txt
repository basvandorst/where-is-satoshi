So how is luck involved then? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:02:51
Definitely! Good point
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:24:20
I see, thank you very much for the clarification.

Well you better fix yourself a sandwich because it might take a while. Don't starve!

So Bitcoin is life?

Maybe a stupid question but: What is this chart telling us? I have no idea.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:05:03
Is it possible to pay the seller with sofortüberweisung? The account confirmation works with that.

$8500 in mining rig is $8500 being thrown away. You won't be able to make up for it. As everyone here says: if you are doing it for the ROI just buy bitcoins straight away. 
Forget the mining.

Why is everyone talking about Satoshis? It's just so counter-intuitive: oh yeah a Satoshi is 10^-8 BTC, yeah...
I really feel like Satoshi chose the 10^-8 in order to be able to set up something comparable that we have with euros and dollards. 1 µBTC = 10^-6 BTC and Satoshis act like cent to the dollar and euro. So 100 Satoshi (Cent) = 1 µBTC. 
To me it feels like the best thing to do, but that's just my 2 Satoshis.

A hash is not random at all. As I said in my OP for the same input you always get the same output. So something in the input has to be random or otherwise there is no luck involved.

Should I create a dota 2 bitcoin bet site? :D 
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:05:04
Care to share the Repo link?
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:24:51
Thank you very much!

I don't have a lot of time but:
Against Bitcoin: Black Markets are definitely not an argument since the same can be said about cash. 
A counter argument might be that for the most non tech-savy average joe out there it might be harder to secure bitcoin than secure his cash.
About the future of the Bitcoin:
1. You can't just print more and thus create inflation. (There are a fixed amount of bitcoins out there)
2. No Fraud: The system verifies itself so noone can just come and pretend that they have 1000 BTC if they don't.
3. Anonymous (Maybe not everyone cares, but certainly a benefit)
There are lots of other benefits too (like no chargebacks etc) but if you ask this subreddit if it is the future currency, you pretty much get a big YES as answer.

Yes I understood the basic part but I was more interested in the technical side and the answer to that is still a bit unclear
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:22:42
Thank you. This fully answers my question :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:26:11
Yay, rich :D My .2 BTC are hwaiting
Edit: Thanks for explanaition
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:26:19
I see, thank you :)

Sorry but I still don't get it. Why would it need to store ownership information if it would only send the 5 BTC?
