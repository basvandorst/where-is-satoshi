i am so puzzeld why there is no people be interested in this.i personally think it is worthy to disscus
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:55:45
more sad thing you mentioned
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:24:54
don't fight with your mouth
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:14:43
very thanks.but i didn't agree with the first reason because Ver own so many bitcoins too.
@_date: 2017-03-24 05:47:24
we cannot live for bitcoin.we use bitcoin because we think bitcoin has value instead of bitcoin has value itself.bitcoin is tool.we control bitcoin instead of bitcoin controlling us.it is economics .it is not politics.so there is no conspirators.would bitcoin community want to become chinese communist party?
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:59:01
i don't think so.maybe they just need spend their 20% hashrate on attacking core is enough.

@_date: 2017-03-24 06:54:35
me too.but the reality give me neither.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:12:50
i agree with that some Chinese miners were so greedy although i am Chinese.
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:57:38
the BU is good for miners.there is no reasons for miners not join in BU.so the test will become the disaster
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:52:29
i don't hava any idea......the bitcoin is my first investment..
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:47:46
oh,how stupid i am.methinks the fee is fixed all the time.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:58:27
in my eyes,it is very easy to make the money from that.why there is little people to do that. i am so puzzeld...
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:23:11
thanks for your suggestion.the bitcoin going up to 8500 yuan in last night!!increasing 1000 yuan!! how crazy!i miss a chance.i am hesitating to buy or not
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:48:29
but  i found the many miners set a minimum value for the transcation fee.
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:25:39
yes, it's very right.that is what i see in the Chinese bitcoin market.
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:20:04
i just want to discuss the price of the bitcoin.i didn't mean it is a proud thing.why are you so hostile?
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:29:14
i want to do that.but it is very unconvinient to the trading bitcoin on the exchanges.you know. the price changes quickly!
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:48:40
thanks,i tried your tool.it said the transcation fee is too low so refused my transcaion.i admit that i made a mistake for paying lower this time fee.i would pay higher fee in the future
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:19:01
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:25:44
yes, it's very right.that is what i see in the Chinese bitcoin market.
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:24:20
sorry,do you mean the micro payment would happen in lightning network without fee?i had little knowledge about the lightning network,i would google it and learn more.but i still feel a confused.
@_date: 2017-01-11 06:26:36
thanks,but if the bitcoin always stuck with 0 confirmations,which is euqal to losing bitcoin.so how can i get my bitcoin back?
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:06:44
yes,the blockchain.com shows " Fee is too low. Minimum fee is 1.5",how can i send the bitcoin with the higher fee.
@_date: 2017-01-11 06:28:59
thanks,i understand a little now.but how can i clear the 0 confirmations or resend it with higher fee?
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:46:43
thanks,the bitocin didn't back to my wallet....i searched in google and found some issue that the transaction got stuck months...i think it is a shortage of bitcoins.it should provide a method to resend the bitcoin with higher fee at least
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:24:43
i think the price is higher than the real value of the bitcoin for the time being.because most Chinese buyer are speculators.
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:05:54
correct!1-5 dollars per transcation.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:55:10
good sell and bad holder
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:07:15
he should make all people know how suck bitfinex is!
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:21:40
thanks ,i would do that
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:27:16
it is very good to the healthy development of the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:19:00
bitcoin-core,i always spent enough transcation fee in the past.but i am not to hurry to get the bitcoin last time, so i spent smaller transaction fee, then it got stuck.Did it probably that one transaction get stuck forever.it is first time that i meet this issue so i felt a little worried.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:30:55
no force.only  scam
@_date: 2017-04-15 10:13:38
the amount of this adress is rough 45000 BTC
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:01:39
i can sure most of the high UTXO address of the list belongs to the Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-04-15 10:12:23
16cou7Ht6WjTzuFyDBnht9hmvXytg6XdVT this address voting for some negative topics to core.i think maybe it belongs to Roger Ver

don't be fool
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:16:08
hope that work!
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:15:51
we have no idea now.even the govern ban exchange.we still hold. but if we cannot run bitcoin here.every holder would go to panic
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:43:39
thanks very much.but it is time-consuming to me to review the code.i would do that when i am not busy.i would read the understandable artcle firstly
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:11:01
oh!thanks!i should spent more time on the tech of  lightening network.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:36:03
i had tried to explain these to miners.but the managers of the ant pool told miners that the segwit would result to POS.and POS would destroy the miners.and many miners believe the antpool instead of people like me.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:43:39
thanks for your article.i very need it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:12:56
i am a little regret for i should sell out the day before yesterday then i would have more money to buy.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:40:50
i strongly agree with you.maybe i should sell out my bitcoins the day before yesterday.because i am really dispointed to the behave of the miners.
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:38:04
i want to take some actions to help them out of the scamming of the ant pool
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:37:36
i agree with you totally.in the beginning i think the miners is very experienced on bitcoin.but after i talked with them and learn about them in their forum.i found them even didn't understand bitcoin.most of them choose mine bitcoin just becuase they have cheap or free electricity.and they think minning is more  low-risky than trading,so they are cheated by ant pool easily.in their mind,segwit is monster.bitcoin core is the dictator.this kind of minding not only in the miners' head,but also in many traders' head.
