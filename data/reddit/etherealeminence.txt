The problem is that it's dependent on having the right fee. It is obvious that we can't *all* pay the right fee.
Bitcoin is definitely suitable for asynchronous online purchases. Not so much for buying something in a store..although there are other approaches that seem reasonable there (e.g. Lightning Network)

Without scaling, however, Bitcoin will become agonizingly slow - more jam-packed blocks and more delayed transactions. I'm not quite sure what needs to happen (and I don't have​ any skin in the game), but increases in difficulty and usage are clearly outstripping increases in hashpower (and relying on "more power" to fix the problem just encourages centralization!).

Regardless, if it takes several hours for a txn to clear, then it's going to be a pain in the arse to use as a general currency.
People don't want to pay high fees to get decent (but still unreliable) performance.

I suppose it could be worth up to the market cap of Bitcoin, if you count a flash drive with private keys on it as an ounce of the stuff :P

It wouldn't even have to be secret. Just flood the economy with bad notes and it'll collapse. Germany tried this during World War II, but didn't execute it on a large enough scale to really have an effect.
But nation state vs. nation state and nation state vs. community are very different things, and it seems quite feasible to me.
