I'm guessing they are holding a little over 37 BTC and that would make them a millionaire.

Yeah, these transactions are in [block  But it doesn't show any transaction fees. 
I think the miner was supposed to collect all those transactions that didn't have a To address, but it didn't, so the coins may really be lost after all.

Edit: I guess the miner did not collect because the coins were specified as an output, even though the output address is bad. I think the miner should have recognized a problem with these transactions and should not have included them in the block.

Funny, that's my exact amount too. I started mining a with a single 5770  a few months ago.

I didn't mess with it, so I'm getting 189 MHash/s out of the box.
Actually, I was getting 120MHash/s for the first couple of weeks, then I made sure it was adequately cooled and it jumped up to 189.

I mined 14.5 BTC from a single 5770 over the past few months. I was planning on selling once I broke even ($100 + electricity costs), but I don't think I'll ever reach that anymore.

I would expect miners to receive the coins as transaction fees rather than them being "destroyed"
From the wiki:
The sender makes a transaction with more coins in the In portion than the Out portion so that there are “leftovers” not assigned to any address.
Whoever ends up publishing the block which contains this transaction will take these (and any other) leftover coins. They are included with their normal generated coins and is an extra bonus for creating the block.
