digital items, like subscriptions, licences, serial keys.. and crypto (altcoins) was exchanged for btc on another service. it was caught before escalating into 10 btc, 15 btc and god know how much. by the time i pulled the plug that damage was done. since money/items went out but no btc truly went in i had to "fix" that from my own pockets with a loan, in order to keep everything working and this issue hidden from others. i really didnt have any other option i know this is not a smart thing to do

 is the url, they are well known (not like blockchain.info i guess). shapeshift was using the same api i was using time ago so i felt very safe, testing was successful and this heist was really something i could never expect from them

hey everybody look, its blockcypher co-owner, scammer and criminal here, trying to shut me off after they stole 7 btc from me and failed to stole 0.5 btc more. pathetic.

yes i have all the emails between me / blockcypher support. when this happened i promplty contacted them and gave them information, txid of transactions and all the tokens of their api i was using. their tokens are used to track everything a client does, all transactions he checks. so they are perfectly able to check im not lying. im 100% willing to give all the subreddit moderators access to my email account so they can verify this is true. in fact please mods can i do this?

i had to take a loan to pay back all the digital items and crypto stolen with doublespends with the exchange rates of that day (higher) . [blockcypher]( is a bitcoin company offering api services for websites / other services. they are also apparently scammers, since one of their workers tried to extort me 0.5 btc to "fix this for me".

hey everybody look, its blockcypher co-owner, scammer and criminal here, trying to shut me off after they stole 7 btc from me and failed to stole 0.5 btc more. pathetic. edit: yes of course i took the loan to keep the business rolling and gave a nice xmas to all the workers. stop trying to silence this with bullshit excuses you make up. this issue is your company owning me 7 btc.

i can take a screenshot showing the emails yes, but the blockcypher tokens
ive used are pretty much useless as there is no public data for those.
i remember giving them some of the affected transactions txid and saying "please look up the others inspected by my tokens using your internal systems" cause they were a lot, and they started disappearing from blockchain, now they dont show up anymore, just as they never existed. i contacted already the moderators of this subreddit before posting to ask for permissions since this topic is strange, and offered myself to gave them the login to my email account.

you are a scammer, go away.

i went to a lawyer, poor guy was left with headache. a lawsuit can be started but he said it would take years and the outcome is not sure. blockcypher is us-based so its international, that doesnt help. also it would be "better" if they return 7 btc to me in bitcoin currency, cause the exchange rate keeps changing it wouldnt be fair i think.

i found the username of the reddit user who tried to extort me 0.5 btc saying he works for them and a lot of lies. just exposing to warn others, i could screenshot his pm. he says he would have to travel to get my 7 btc back and it costs 0.5 btc, he claims to be co-owner of blockcypher yet he didnt even asked what my issue was. he refuses escrow, brags abut being so rich yet wont even lift a finger for free. he is extremely aggressive and rude, i think is just a poor scam attempt. if its true is disgusting to ask a paying customer who lost 7 btc a "refund fee" of 0.5 btc, probably illegal too?
his messages (parts of):

thank you for support. im worried cause blockcypher just ignores me, their ceo, catheryne nicholson [linkedin]( [twitter]( just brushed me off with "our api is not safe sorry" and completely started ignoring me.
even after i told her this is ruining my life, provided her support team with all the proof necessary and waited 2+ weeks. i dont know what to do, yes i can earn money working but this 7 btc loss is a massive damage that would take years and years to fix.. you know if my pc was hacked, trojaned, if i gambled with this money and lost it would be different, i could blame my stupid ass. but damn losing it like this because of someone else fault, a bug in a trusted service like this...it hurts..and they wont even help me..on top of this ive paid over 5000$ to premium services to them during the last years so they are doing this to a paying customer.. sorry for ranting

dont even talk to me anymore please, just stop.  you tried to scam 0.5 btc to me, a guy in this situation, under xmas. you should just feel bad.  if you truly co-own blockcypher what you tried to pull off with me is even worse.  just leave me alone please i dont need vultures yet, im still alive.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:25
trust me dude im in a very bad situation mentally, jumping from a bridge for real is something im considering because of this. cause i dont know how to fix it. waking up in the morning realizing i lost 7 btc and faking being normal to my wife is hard.
the saddest thing is my life was perfect before blockcypher ruined it, working in crypto, beautiful kids and wife. i couldnt dream more. fml.. this loss is not even my fault..dont feel bad for 0.02 or 0.2 losses, your life is surely worth more..mine is probably worth less than 7 btc i guess. i wish you all the best &lt;3
