People act like it's sure to pay off. Remember that it was like 10 dollar a month ago.
Everyone should understand why bitcoins are valued 10x higher now than some time ago. It is based on the trust of people and the speculation of other people.
Folks taking out a loan should seriously realise that it can go down as fast as it goes up.

I think giving your phone a 100% workload for a prolonged time will do no good to the phone. It would be a waste of such a fine SGS4

Well considering the birthday paradox, and the possibility of bitcoin going really big in automated systems generating millions of addresses per second, the odds become more realistic.
But we are probably good for a long long time.

And why shouldn't we join them?
EDIT: Thanks, I didn't know 51% of the hashrate can be used the irregulate the blockchain.
In the post on bitcointalk BTC guild states it uses the statictics from: 
blockorigin indicates only 36% is mined by BTC guild.

I estimate that I mined for like 2 months with a HD4870. 
But just casually while I was at my pc,  not 24/7.
So $10 in 2 months, I figured it wasn't really worth it.

I think it is a good thing there is no one to credit for Bitcoin.
It makes it more as a entity that is "just there" instead of a product made by a person.
It helps accepting this concept easier if it is not promoted by anyone or anything, because I think people would be hesistant if there is something directly profiting from this.

I started mining in 2011, got 1 BTC and stopped because it was not really worth it at that time.
BTC was $10 or something back then.
Didn't put money in it, ofcourse it would have been a good investment but that is looking back now.
