I have only contributed to the r/bitcoin reddit a few times. But I visited here often to read the discussion. Someone please tell me how you know or see "downvotes"? How does one actually
downvote. Please point me to the info on Reddit that discuss this.

A merchant can't know whether cash has been through the hands of criminals when you spend it and can't be held liable. Can this be enforced for bitcoin? I doubt it. Blacklisting is NOT the way to go! Let's leave the blockchain's integrity alone.

I really love the look of your T's,  I ordered one to see them first hand. If they are like they look on-line, I will certainly order more.

I do not consider myself a libertarian. And I think the article is totally wrong about women, black people and poor. Stupid people will have difficulty.  This not a libertarian only currency,
there are some features of the money for most people. Kenyans have been using digital money for many years and they should have no problems adapting to bitcoin.

I think this is a great idea! I downloaded the new version and clicked on Buy/Sell Bitcoin and sellers near me appeared. It shows that the nearest seller to me is 212km away. I think (know) I am in a bitcoin desert...Mobile, Alabama. Or it could be that nobody in my area is selling (like me).

|despite the fact that they centralize keys and take a way a lot of the core values of bitcoin
I am fairly new ( a couple months into bitcoin world). Please explain this.

I agree.  I am not a bitcoin techie, but I have read the literature and I use to be a programmer (a life-time ago) and it is my understanding that the information can be traced. The coins could be tracked through the blockchain. Some effort to trace these coins should be undertaken. BTW I did not lose money on MTGOX.

This is the dumbest article I've read in some time. This guy obvious doesn't know a thing about bitcoin to point any of it potential weaknesses. He's just repeating things he has heard.

I've been on r/bitcoin for about a month now and I want to thank you for defining what FUD means.

If you complete ALL your info, which includes a credit card, you can get your BTC instantly. That's how I roll with Coinbase.

I agree that all bit-coiners should be aware that they are responsible for their own assets.  There are reasons to use on-line wallets, however, for temporary storage when trading and some other business reasons.  I believe those wallets should be responsibly secured and ensured by the on-line company (like Blockchain,info).
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:06:01
Blockchain.info is in maintenance mode.

[The average "conservative" believes the national budget should be balanced and the debt paid down.]
This is false. Please notice how fast the debt rises when they are in power. They only profess to be a 'balanced budget' party when they are OUT of power!
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:02:18
You just described the major problem with bitcoin... security.  This is total madness for someone to have to do to secure their funds! I am a bitcoin enthusiast and I do own some bitcoin, not much. I only buy a small amount because even though I consider myself computer literate, I don't want to go to all the above procedures. Until I can store my bitcoin safely without all this, I will keep my ownership of bitcoin to a minimum.

If a pool gets over 51% hashing power, don't all those miners have to agree to an attack?  Just my acquiring 51%, a pool would have to get the miners to go along with the attack, don't they? I am somewhat of a lost on this. Would somebody clear this up for me?

Actually BTC is BTC and right now you can buy them much cheaper on Gox.  Maybe a good way to arbitrage would be advantageous. But then, you;d have to deal with Mt Gox (BAH).

I really love Stephan's enthusiasm for bitcoin. However, I think the talk was more political than anything else. This libertarian view is NOT held by all bitcoin holders.  And angry hatred for the government will not be something to entice other adopters of the currency or platform.  
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:59:53
Actually the post office is not a government entity.  It is NOT supported by tax dollars.  The post office is semi government and is man-dated to NOT make a profit.  So, I don't see the bitcoins being handed over to them.  I do think, however, that if the Postal service use bitcoin it would be good for bitcoin.

I thought I knew what libertarianism was until I heard Rand Paul says he approves of the Keystone pipeline going through people's land when they did not want their personal property trashed.

Never, Never use any technology that is proprietary like Apple. I know that iPhone has proliferated the cell phone market by slick advertisement. When you compare the latest Android phone to the current version of iPhone, I frankly don't see much advantage to iPhone. So my advice is the next time an upgrade is needed, simply switch to Android...problem solved!

This is what I envisioned bitcoin to do!  I certainly hope this happens in all places like Uganda!

Ver is the reason I have absolutely NO respect for libertarians. He was a millionaire before bitcoin is his mantra. How self indulgent! 
BTW the name is BCASH and I have some only because I had bitcoin at the time of the fork.
