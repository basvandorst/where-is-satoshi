Such a misleading title... 
I though I'd be able to boot up the app and be able find people ready and willing to get into a physical altercation for a bitcoin reward.  Much sadness.

Thanks!  I just posted an add on Kijiji (Canadian craigslist) and I got several replies from people offering to rent us their buildings for BTC.

Thanks for the information!

Yeah, I'm pretty sure our gov't hasn't had anything to do with BTC yet.  People are generally safe over here.

Laws like this are the reason we're having another company set-up and manage an ATM.  We do not want to be considered any type of currency exchange.

There's not even anything funny about what he's saying...

Let me tell you why.
About a month ago, 3 Friends and I decided to split on a small 2mh/s mining rig.  When we started discussing the profits on facebook, more people started giving us money to manage more rigs, we figured we might as well.  We then started getting larger investments, people were giving us $2000-$10000 each to build and manage larger rigs.  In a month our $2500 mining rig turned in to over $30000 worth of equipment.  My house started tripping breakers left and right, so we decided to move to an office that can provide the power we need.  Since we were getting more and more requests to set businesses up to accept BTC, we decided to go a more professional route with everything and open the office as a public office kind of like a bitcoin cafe, where people can some to discuss all the happenings surrounding BTC with people that have similar interests.  We even found a place that we can rent and pay for it in BTC.  Anyway, the whole point is that we went from hobbyists to starting a business in about a month, and haven't had the time to get everything set up properly.

Thanks for the info, I'll get in touch with them shortly.  From what I've read, I really like the direction they're going.

Don't speak for all of us.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:27:52
Correct, we are scrypt mining with these right now. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:26:13
Our office will be a public office, more like a lounge, where people can come in to discuss Bitcoins and the BTC industry in general.

We're a bitcoin Mining, and general services company.  We are in the middle of getting various businesses throughout Windsor setup to accept BTC.  We're currently setting up the Beer Exchange as well as Ten Friends Diner to accept BTC.  We've got many more requests for more as well.  If We had a sushi place that accepted BTC I'd never eat anything else :P

Since this is a new, emerging market, it's hard to track down every single payment processor as they do not all have the visibility the few known ones have.  I have already written to every payment processor that I could find.  I'm hoping to attract some lesser known, or new payment processors.

You had better!
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:45:53
I'll give them a go, thanks for the information!

@_date: 2014-03-09 00:01:11
Well I'm glad you posted here, I'll be in touch shortly!
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:52:57
100% would not.
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:30:03
I was worried where this was going for a second.  I'm glad they switched up the hand on the other side.
