Smart miners would most likely be able to mine BTC at a lower price then the actual price to pay for a BTC would be. Because where would be the point of mining?

People here and their advice. Guy comes to BTC sub asks if he should invest and people are pretty much saying "Well... If you really need to... But be sure to book a week of vacation because you need to read up on it first and watch 300+ videos of some nerd and takes computer security class."
How the hell is this shit to take off if you are acting so wired about all that stuff if someone asks you about it?

I think sucessfull mining operations have a more complex plan lined up then just doing the same thing every day. They know of the halvening so they would be hording BTC now, when price drops to sell when they don't get as much BTC as they did before. I think they are also anticipating a sharp price increase in the future in hopes of selling this horded BTC at a much higher price. Like tightening the belt now to live lavishly in the future.
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:18:23
This is a really complicated way to pay with fiat imho. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:00:16
Feels like we got hardened with fire. :D
I was in crypto 2015, but did not pay attention to the price movement, got bored and left (sadly). 
This time I will pay attention, will buy all these fucking dips, will feel the pain, will learn and will not fucking leave! This is a lifelesson right here. Even if it will be „dont wast your time on shit“. But this time I want to have it all.

@_date: 2018-06-23 14:24:17
It was at Room66 in Berlin. I payed 1sat per byte.
@_date: 2018-06-23 14:18:52
Then please reread the first post I responded to. Maybe I am missing your point. How was it easier back then to buy coffee with it? I even doubt that you could find a place to buy coffee with BTC when it was that low.
I know that the price of BTC fluctuates but that doesnt have any effect on the ease of use.

Oh no! Dont put the white on paper! Mirror works better - so coke doesnt stick to paper.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:33:49
Thanks for sharing your experience! I would say that applies when trading. But if your not a trader and don't look at charts all the time but still care about a good entry price, I think this a good strategy against FOMO.
@_date: 2019-10-02 14:21:30
Not true. Fiat is for buying more BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:37:45
Totally. Thats why I was wondering why OP thinks that they should keep the miners.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:30:06
So, what is it now? 
It used to be easy (how?) or it used to be cheap (1ct now)?
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:18:51
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:14:04
Thanks! Though the hassle would be much greater then it turned out to be.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:41:10
Wow! This is the same shit people were saying in Jan18. It went down because it went up way to fast. Not because of fucking Coinbase.
Its fucking crazy how fast we go back to this mentality RIGHT AFTER we witnessed a 16 month bear market, with a loss above 80%.
@_date: 2019-08-30 07:06:44
It's as if the lawmakers would profit from this. But that would be crazy. Right?

Its actually not that hard. If you were actually trading you would be able to relate to the dollar price as well.
@_date: 2019-10-02 14:19:49
Ah! Yeah... Sure... I was joking. 
To be honest with the comment OP made I really get the impression he is living a boring live. A lowlife.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:08:26
No... it went down perfectly nice at a Fibonacci resistance. It was poised to go down anyways. On the other hand I wouldnt have been surprised if it went up further. But this conspiracy shit is the same bs people came up with to reason the correction (later crash) in Jan 18. 
Some third evil party that we have no controll of is always the reason. China, whale groups, et la. Its fucking stupid. It couldnt be that BTC is just such a volatil asset that behaves like it did in the past. No it was evil coinbase.
@_date: 2019-02-13 11:03:38
But then IOTA pumped and you were able to pay it all back at once?
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:26:26
Yes... 6 &gt; 3k had to happen. BTC was printing a HUGE down ward triangle. Those thend to break down most of the times. Get your emotions under control and lean a little bit about market psycholgy.

We were fine when it was at 8k. Well be fine at 11k.
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:09:29
Hmm... you could „invest“ in Bitcoin by giving Blockstream money, hoping they make something productiv with your money, which will generate more money for you in return. But if you put money in a currency you are speculating on something to happen so the price will rise. You are not giving it to someone to improve the actual products.
Thats how I would define it.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:04:52
I do the same with my friends. Works wonders. When ever I borough money for a dinner or a bar stoll I offer to pay them back in Bitcoin. About half the people are cool with it.

My folks know I am into BTC, I explain to them why I think its great. I never tell them to invest. But when I owe someone a small amount of money (10-20$) I ask if he/she is interested in getting it back in BTC. About 1/3 of the people I offered this were exited to except that deal. Then I help them set up a mobile wallet, tell them about the importance to write down the seed and show them the magic. Its awesome.

While you are right, that everything could happen... 
But considering the blockchain aspect and the currency aspect... If you want to use something that is called "blockchain" and not "server" you need the currency aspect. The currency aspect is the incentive for decentralisation. Without the currency there is no decentralisation, thus you dont need a blockchain to store your values (currency or information). 
Certain companies are using their own blockchain already, without the currency aspect of it. Maybe I am missing something, but if there is a central point of failure (on party in control), why not just use a plain and simple server to store information?

Wouldnt a 90% drop place BTC at the 2k mark? For 1k it needs to drop 95%.

"Before you shoot me... You already figured out that Im not an idiot. Are you sure that this wallet wasnt yet another decoy wallet? "

You know that you can set up multiple wallets on those devices? One wallet is for your hodling the other one for special situations like this. Where you can act all like "Oh no! Please bad thieve, don't take my Bitcoin, please! Oh you want to hurt me? Please take my BTC instead. Here are all my 0.5 BTC I was able to buy. You can leave now." While on the other wallet on the same device there is you 10BTC steach. But the thieve thinks he got it all, because you gave him the password and he saw for him self that there is not more on there. 
Of course no one in the world can own as much as 10BTC.

I actually really dont know if it is. Maybe you can do some digging. But I have seen him printed on everything. I know that doesnt mean anything... Maybe you can do your own version?
Its kind if THE meme in the crypto community, so it would be a really nice touch if you could play rollercoaster guy.
