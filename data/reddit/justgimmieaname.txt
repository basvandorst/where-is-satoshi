can you put some estimated numbers behind this assertion? 
1 more ETF out of how many in existence (500? 1000?) is going to yield the Feds how much more tax rev?  The US federal budget is $4 trillion.  Tax rev from a coin ETF would be how much?  
Frankly I doubt that tax income is an important factor when the SEC decides on any ETF.  Politics would be a much larger factor

As maybe the first big company to accumulate reserves, how Overstock manages them will set important precedents.

Andreas said on video that a 51% attack cannot steal our coins, all it can do is double spend the coins that the plotters already control.
As a layperson I assume this is true because I've seen nobody refute that so far.  So, any experts within in earshot, is Andreas right about that?
Ok, so lets assume Andreas is right.  Then let's assume that the plotters  double spend some coin and they get away with it.  Let's assume maximum damage (biggest number of double spent coins, maximum number of merchants impacted).  What do these numbers look like compared to the total existing number of BTC coin and merchants?  I have no idea...
After the initial media hyperventilation and price crash, wouldn't we expect a recovery, just like after a mega Goxxing?  After all, fiat systems also have fraud and "double spends."  And the world still turns on its axis, and fiat still gets spent.

I've lived long enough t become extremely suspicious about journalism in general.  I think only a small minority of journalists are "impartial".  Any informed viewer needs to ask themselves who is paying the journalist and who pays the journalist's employer?  Here the chain would be roughly as follows: [big banks and fortune 500 co's (who are alligned with the FED] &gt; pay advertising fees to Bloomberg; [Bloomberg] pays "journalist".  So it is the advertisers upstream that set the agenda.

If localbitcoins got big enough, with enough buyers and sellers to have some decent market depth, they could bridge the remittance gap.  Also if they integrated forward contracts they could manage the flows more easily (e.g. arrange BTC buyers in the Philippenes to commit to buying x quantity at y price tomorrow).  We'll get there.

essentially after the 2010 Citizens United supreme court ruling.  
In the USA, from then on, donating money by organizations is considered free speech.  So, many bitcoin observers believe that this precedent is GOOD for bitcoin, in the event that the Feds should attempt to ban it outright.  
Plaintiffs could argue that if they can't use bitcoin to donate to causes, their constitutional rights are violated.  Also religious organizations that receive bitcoin donations could make a very compelling 1st Amend. argument.
Of course the outcome of such a suit would depend on the final judgement of the crony-infested group of 9 supreme court justices that we currently have...

Many historians also "blame" him for nazism, Bolshevism, hitler and WWII.  Summarizing, the logic goes like this: Wilson gets USA into WWI, which was dying down to a stalemate at that late date and was headed for a cease fire between Germany / France &amp; UK.  USA breathes fresh life into the war, so millions more die and scales are tipped in favor of the allies.  So then Versailles treaty and the Germans get their faces rubbed in the poop, so to speak.  War reparations lead to punishing inflation in Germany, unemployment, high taxes, wounded national pride and burning resentment.  Enter Hitler, stage left.  Meanwhile Vlad Lenin makes the most of anti war exhaustion in Russia to deftly maneuver a very unlikely coup by a relatively small fringe Bolshevik party.  
Personally I find this logic very compelling and reasonable.  Tom Woods, the libertarian and Austrian economics guru, has a much fuller explanation of this theory.
As an American I am CERTAIN that we have a dismal tradition of "bull in the china shop" foreign policy.

as a former investment banker who has worked many times with lawyers to edit SEC proxy statements (essentially the same deal as a 10-k), I can say that lawyers are hyper conservative and paranoid about getting every possible bit of info in these docs.  It's a cover-your-ass type of mentality, so that nobody can later sue their client by saying "you didn't warn me about XYZ" (in this case, bitcoin).
So, a 1 time mention of bitcoin at the very bottom of the competitors risk list does not seem very significant to me.  Basically, it feels more like something the lawyer wanted to include rather than the result of what management was audibly concerned about.
still, a good post to see

you may be right.  Maybe the lawyers were damned if they do, damned if they don't.  For sure they are now on record as admitting that Gox ran their business fraudulently for at least a few weeks.  It's as if an important fiat bank suffered a massive robbery of 80% of all their deposits and decided not to inform the public, which kept on making deposits unawares.
If I were the lawyer I suppose I would have tried to word the document without making precise reference to the time Gox management realized that they had indeed been "robbed".  Or just say "for a few weeks client was not sure, but then on x date client was sure and they immediately halted all trading"

Also, I have read that flipping a coin 256 times (let's call it "a flipping session") yields a perfectly legit private key.  If so, how can you possibly reduce the number to 2^160?  That would imply that 2 or more "flipping sessions" can correspond to the same private key.  What am I getting wrong?

It would not make sense to pay, for example, $0.10 (BTC equivalent) to read an article and an equal amount as a transaction fee.

The paradox lies in the fact that there a 2 kinds of money: 1) base money (made by central banks) and 2) debt money (made by commercial banks through fractional reserve banking at the moment of lending).
The first kind of money is inflating like crazy all over the world.  The second kind has generally been decreasing all over the world as banks decrease their lending and adopt ultra conservative policies such as parking their eccess reserves at the central banks.
Tyically the quantity of the second type is much bigger than the first.  The ratio is about 10 to 1 if not mistaken but somebody correct me if I'm wrong

*Each of the top 50 private equity firms in world has raised enough money RECENTLY to buy the entire currency outright.*
Are you saying that these firms have recently raised $6 billion or more?  If so, there is no way they could buy all 12 million bitcoin for such a small amount.  Most of the 12 million are not for sale at anything close to the current level.
It's anybody's guess what it would cost to "buy the currency outright" but I'd say 1) a few million are simply not for sale at any price over the next 5 to 10 years, and 2) If you wanted to buy a few million BTC say over the next 12 months it would cost you at the very least the total current bitcoin market cap.

In terms of his career Matt is taking a pretty smart calculated gamble, IMO.  If crypto currencies become a major factor in economy over the next 10 years, he will be on record as one of the very first and only mainstream journalists to have alerted the public and seen the potential.  If crypto coin fizzles he will have some egg on his face but that's all.  Not saying Matt's choice is pure calculation (no doubt he truly believes in bitcoin) just saying the outcome for him has more upside than downside risk.

do you understand the difference between 1) naked short selling and 2) traditional short selling (where the assets are legitimately borrowed)?  You do understand that in the first case the seller is essentially fabricating assets out of thin air, right?  If you owned stock in a company you created, how would you like it if somebody simply conjured shares in your company and started selling them?  Like the way some conman sells the Brooklyn Bridge to some naive victim.  Risk and return have nothing to do with it.  This is about ethics.  Right and wrong.  Naked shorting is stealing somebody's property.

there needs to be an option to quote prices in fiat, with automatic conversion to BTC based on a lookup to a reference market price (e.g. bitstamp or whatever).  That way a seller can insert the price and not have to worry about updating the price every day / hour in the volatile bitcoin space.

I was reasoning with a Frank Underwood, Washington as House of Cards mentality.  Right now Yellen's clients and sponsors (the TBTF banks) are likely barking at her about many issues of greater priority than bitcoin.  But what happens when/if the price hits 10,000 and bitcoin starts to make Jamie Dimon et. al. start to shit their pants about margins and profits?

Ask yourself a different question: can you conceive of any new monetary system that does NOT create a relatively small crew of rich early adopters?  
I mean, regardless of the money's form (digital, paper fiat, silver coins, tokens, seashells,, what have you).  From a practical point of view, I think it's impossible not to have early adopters.  Even 5,000 year-old gold money with its gold rushes and mining permits inevitably favors early adopters, large investors, and the politically connected.
Perhaps if somebody huge like Facebook created digital Facebucks (or Googlebucks, etc.) and decided to give every one of its 1 billion account holders the same amount in the same instant.  But then you have the credibility problem of the money itself.  And even then it would be impossible to get that money into every human's hands.

Today we are talking 6% of all bitcoins.  3 years ago they would have been what? 15%? 20%?.  I mean, how can you expect to gather 15% of any market with thousands of players without massively elevating the price?  If the price is 10 USD, see how long it stays that way as you try to buy 1 or 2% of the market.  The only way would be to try to broker 3 or 4 massive off-exchange trades with early adopters.  Fees are way too small to ever amount to hundreds of thousands of BTC.

"an effective decision-making process" = put some group in charge.  People in charge = corruption, sooner or later.
Like many, I got excited about bitcoin because nobody is in charge. Satoshi seemed quite comfortable with that.  Isn't the bitcoin decision making process basically Darwinian evolution?  Somebody/group put a fork out there and if the majority of node operators &amp; miners follow (because after study, it makes sense to them) that's bitcoin's new direction.

my plan is to use a BIP38 password that you don't need to memorize, and write the clues to the password directly on the paper wallet.  
These clues will be meaningless to a thief but allow a family member or loved one to reconstruct the password in case you walk under a falling anvil or some such.
"our street number when we lived in LA, followed by the name of Mary's pet orange cat, followed by our high school sports teams' name, etc., etc."
Clearly if the thief is a computer expert, after a time they can hack the password with a guessing software, but under most circumstances you'll have enough time after the robbery to obtain a redundant copy of the wallet and x-fer the funds to a new wallet.

Look at who owns Overstock.  Patrick Byrne is a major libertarian and there is a natural fit between libertarians and bitcoin.  As an american living in Europe it is my experience that libertarians in Europe are few and far between.  Europeans are instinctively more reticent to change than Americans, and Bitcoin is a big change.  There are a few Patrick Byrne-esque entrepreneurs in Europe who have embraced bitcoin (Virgin's Branson comes to mind) .  
Here in Europe we just have to be more patient.  It will come sooner or later.  For sure back in the 80's and 90's the PC was embraced by Italian society significantly slower and later than in America.

2FA with 2 devices is not really needed in most cases (talking about mobile).
Think about how it works now with your "dumb" leather wallet.  Why don't your keep all the cash you posess in there? Among other reasons, because if your wallet is lost or stolen you are totally fucked, so better to just keep a few days spending cash in there, right?
Works the same way with bitcoin.  Just load breadwallet onto your smartphone and never keep more than a few days worth of spending coin on it at any time.  So any "hack" is no more tragic than you losing your wallet to a pickpocket or at the train station or whatever.  Plus with breadwallet even if you do lose your phone you can recover the BTC from the seed phrase.

I agree totally with Vibr8gKiwi on the second lion fish, BTW.  I could never prove it with data but it just seems so self-evident.
Regarding the first lion fish, I grew up in DC and have known many people who work on the Hill, lobbyists, etc.  I've had many informed discussions about the perversions to our "un-democracy" or, better, our plutocracy.  But never have I seen or heard the problem of secret balloting being specifically identified.  You make a very convincing case and I think the rewards of instituting secret balloting in Congress would outweigh the risks, as you suggest.  The intractable problems with campaign finance and the "money as free speech" problem in the Bill of Rights / Supreme Court could be artfully dodged with the secret ballot.

all debt money loans that banks make are anchored to some reserve limit imposed by regulators.  Otherwise, any bank could in theory make trillion dollar loans right and left and still be compliant.  It is the reserve requirement that sets the boundaries, and since only a fraction of deposits is withheld, hence the term "fractional reserve banking"  
Both theories in the abstract (numbers 2 and 3) are correct in my view.  They are not mutually exclusive.  The portion of new loan which exceeds the reserve amount is the portion which is created "presto" out of thin air.

Good post.  I'm a big fan of your method number 3, which is the only one that can ever send BTC "to the moon".  I have a product that I can't WAIT to start selling for BTC (even though I have realistic expectations that initially I won't be doing much volume in it).  As soon as Open Bazaar is up and running well, I will begin.  To be free of PayPal is priceless and to not have to hire a web developer to implement payment protocol's et. al. is a major relief.

On OB I plan to sell my merchandise that I fulfill through Amazon.  Makes total sense because I can avoid paying Amazon the 15% sales commission and just give them the logistics part.  I assume there are many other sellers out there that will see the logic in this.  The marginal cost to arange selling on OB is near zero so even if sales do not occur on OB, you've lost nothing.

The scenario seems plausible except for one thing.  No Treasury auction will ever be "deserted" because the Fed will ALWAYS bail out the US Govt.  They will do this because each party (the Fed and the Gov't) depends on the other for its very survival. Those douchebags do NOT want to lose their cushy jobs / salaries / perks/ power! The Fed will buy Treasury paper at ANY interest rate that the (supposedly) free market proposes.  The only way this machine blows up is when the Fed creates so much new money that major inflation kicks in.  But recent years have proven that when that may happen is anybody's guess.

yes, and I wonder if there is another catch in terms of restrictions as to the amount you can transfer.  Like, no problem if you want to x-fer 100 or 1,000 USD or GBP, because it's a round number and so easy to find matches.  But if it is 37.45, for example, they might have trouble or ask you to wait a while to find the match.

*In a rather surprising move, Rakuten also announced multi-signature escrow support for certain high-value items on their marketplace. Shoppers may be cautious about the idea of purchasing an expensive item online without the protections that are normally provided by credit card companies, which seems to be why Rakuten decided to add multi-signature escrow support for certain products. The move makes Rakuten the largest company in the world to take advantage of the enhanced security offered to consumers via multi-signature transactions.*

The old line that gov't "owes it to itself" is a misleading.

Here's how I think about money.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with acquiring it (even billions worth) as long as you do no harm to others in the process.  I would argue that bitcoin early adoption is a harmless method of wealth accumulation.  
The key is how you SPEND or INVEST it.  With great wealth comes responsibility.  Period.  If you have it, you have a moral obligation (in my view) to try to help others either through charity or through investments that lead to social and economic improvement.  
PS I think bitcoiners will do a relatively good job at this with respect to other past generations of tech beneficiaries (industrial revolution, silicon valley, etc.)  Rest easy, don't lose sleep and be determined to help others.  You won't regret anything.

are you saying the velocity of bitcoins is much higher than USD, for example?  What you say makes some intuitive sense but I'm having trouble seeing it in a flowchart:  Person X buys $10 of BTC and sends them to micropayment company Y, for his allocated account.  Person X spends 0.10 worth to read an article online, then a few days later Y bundles that payment with thousands of others and sends BTC to media company Z.  At this point are you saying that media company Z somehow spends those coins directly back into the pockets of Person X's, so that they end up immediately back in the micropayment economy?  That sounds like a stretch to me.  More likely, Z cashes them in and uses the resulting fiat currency for their general operating costs, like salaries, bad coffee and post it notes.

Totally agree with Frisby about central banks, fiat money and wars.  
Wars can't happen if they are not financed.  Wide scale adoption of crypto-currencies could be a very positive force in that they would compel societies to wage only those wars that they are prepared to finance with current savings.  As an American I often wonder how many wars we would have waged over the past century if we had not had a central bank.

Imagine a world without central banks and commercial banks conjuring fiat money out of thin air.  In this world the monetary system does not siphon wealth away from the middle and lower classes toward a 1% of cronies and insiders.  (BTW, as a side benefit, wars must be financed with current taxation on a pay-as-you-go basis, and so there are FAR fewer wars).  Now, can you see hedge funds and private equity funds to any significant degree in that world?  I can't, because there's no more Monopoly $$ to play with.  These funds disgust me because they make outsized profits for zero to negative social contributions and the only reason it is possible is because of the perverse monetary system.  I suppose what I am saying is 45% is not the least bit impressive when viewed through this lens.

Update from OP, I just had the following exchange w/ the MGox support desk (note, at the very least they are prompt with their written responses): 
Eiden, Aug 11 20:19 (JST):
Thank you for the email. On checking with your account we could find that you have made a withdrawal request on 2013-07-16 which made your status into "Confirmed". But on checking now your status of withdrawal has been changed to "Pending", which means you cannot do the cancellation, and we can hope that the withdrawal will be processed soon at this stage.
As per your request, I have cancelled your withdrawal done on 25th July for 800€ and the fund has been restored back to your Mt.Gox account. Unfortunately trading fee waiver is not possible from our end. Once the withdrawal has been "Confirmed", you can cancel the withdrawal by placing a request through ticket to us. But if status changes to "Pending", then we would not be able to cancel and credit back the money.
We do not have a count or list of withdrawals with us. We will get back to you once your withdrawal gets processed. As mentioned above, your withdrawal done on 16th July is in "Pending" status and can expect the funds soon into your bank account. Kindly be patient as we get back to you with a positive news.
Best regards,
Mt.Gox Team

Is it possible to cancel the request from 26 July and have the 1,000 credited to my account balance?
Once a withdrawal has been "confirmed" can I cancel it or is my only option to wait for the bank queue?

Stefan is really good and I agree with 90% of what he says here.  But he does get a bit hyperbolic at points.  For instance he exaggerates the possibilities for "automatic" escrow in the block chain.  His example of paying 50 BTC to a web site developer for getting the site online in 30 days proves my point.  Regardless of whether the time stamp function in the blockchain could "see" that the site is online, proper escrow would require a 3rd party human to evaluate that the site was indeed developed according to the contracted specifications (well designed, well written, etc.)

Satoshi's protocol determines that no more new BTC will be created after 2140, though the vast majority of the 21mm total will have been crated in the next few years.  After new coin production stops miners will still process transactions to earn the transaction fees, which by then presumably will be set by a market clearing supply and demand mechanism built into bitcoin wallets

fiat money is any money that the issuing government requires you to accept as payment of a debt.  If it is offered by a debtor you MUST accept it.  Fiat could be backed by gold or anything else.  In practice, these days, fiat monies are not backed by anything.  In the case of USD prior to early 1970's, when Nixon removed the last vestiges of gold backing, the USD was a fiat currency and was at least indirectly backed by gold.

So true. It's important to remember that the banks control the FED, not the opposite.  The large commercial banks are quite literally the FED's shareholders.

I doubt debt and bitcoin are fundamentally compatible.  If that is true, then future bitcoin "banks" will be limited to custodial and escrow type services.  Of course I could be wrong, we'll see.  
With a deflationary currency like bitcoin, you don't need to lend your money to accumulate value, all you need to do is hold on to it.  Lending it out is risky, because there is no central bank ready to pump new currency into the system during down economic times to generate the interest that you expect.  So with the scheduled BTC money supply growing ever more slowly, your debtors will have a hard time scraping together much in terms of interest payments, while your principal remains at risk.

100 years from now, if you assume a global population of 20 billion, with a money supply of 2.1 * 10 ^15 satoshis (more or less), that would be on average 105,000 satoshis per person.

It helps to point out that fiat monies (USD, euro, etc) are in a way "digital, internet" monies as well.  Remind them that the vast majority of USD transactions are the result of electrons passing through wires / waves.  Just like bitcoin.  The main difference is that in one system the record keeping is centralized and in the other it's de-centralized.  
So from that point of view bitcoin will seem more familiar and less threatening.

The big difference is the total outstanding debt today v. historical.  Imagine that the rates revert to the historic mean and so go back to about 5- 7% over the next 3 years.  Then apply those rates to the total outstanding debt of about 17 - 18 trillion.  That means interest expense of about 1+ trillion.  Now compare that to the annual GDP or federal government revenue and it looks very scary.
