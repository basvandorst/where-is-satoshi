you dont give "2 shits" ? how about you telling your jihan master to 2x your moter if you want 2x, he said that before u know ? I dare your whole troll army to use some human logic to disprove me, given that bitcoin is for everyone, how an average person in india can run a full node in 2x when they only earn less than $10 a day and nodes usually dont receive any payment ? are you going to say bitcoin is for people who earn 50$ a day or more ? people like you should be better off stay in alt-coins you know !
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:51:20
You are wrong the very start. Bitcoin started off first with the open core developers community with the solid code they made. At that time, there was no you, me, bitpau, Jihad or anything else. Replace core with a less skilled team is flat-out stupid and a obvious move for power grab with no regard for long term benefit of everyone

its more like going out with a girl, promised to support her and then went to meet another girl. No marriage promise was made to either but...is this similar to what Jihan Wu just did ? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:38:04
Their alt coin will be called shitcoin by me even if bitcoin magically dies. No motherfkin Jihan Wu or DCG entity can make bitcoin, just like gold
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:44:07
lol, you are talking as if we live in the same house. Tell Roger You suck
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:09:25
This stupid fk just proved himself doesn't know a jack shit about soft fork. Go ask Jihan Wu again before demonstrating your stupidity here. Soft fork is just plainly and simply optional and the source code is always open so theres nothing "unknown" dumbass. Go search dictionary what open-source means LOL

@_date: 2017-08-10 15:54:34
I will first listen to both sides, busineses like bitstamp and core developers then will make a decision which option is better long term in terms of decentralization, stability and fairness. Will not except anything resemble Jihan Wu ideas in any relative ways and will sell the wrong coins off
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:14:58
A simple PoW change will solve Everything forever. Now is the time where the damage on innocent miners is the least. We should do a PoW change right now or as soon as 2x activates.

Is it something important ? You want some hashing power little man ?
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:26:43
Go and use bitcoin cash client no one stopping you. Its only that later either all users go back to core client or just you alone using a crappier client and guess what is bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:49:36
Of course, the code was created before the motherfoker Jihan Wu even thought of the name bitman

Are you trying to differentiate who is more intelligent ? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:33:17
You must be stupid as fk to think all miners are stupid like you. They aren't going for that shit like you do. 2x movement is from Jihan wu basically, every bodies know that
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:59:04
Yea, sum it up bitcoin is the one with most decentralized and open network/code
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:24:37

They don't have to keep the damn promise anymore. The motherforker Jihan Wu just forked BCH and no agreement mentioned that shit
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:11:00
No it wont. I can guarantee you that exchanges are way smarter than that and they will stick with core no matter what. Core focuses on long time goal rather than quick profit which is exactly what big businesses need
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:42:53

@_date: 2017-08-09 05:01:34
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:11:00
You saying all of this assuming I have never visited third world countries ? I call people jihan's slaves if they are different ? Looks like someone hasn't read bitcoin history that well people. Jihan got angry after someone said "...dont give 2 fuck/shit...." and said the thing and since then he likely say those "2 fk/shit" as well. If your not slave u dont have to react too strongly u know. Your relevant knowledge is quit low and no point talking anymore, any1 visited 3rd world and know bitcoin well can see your comment is short sighted, short term benefit focused rather than long term. You shouldnt even opened your mouth in the first place, so embarrashing
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:10:45
bitcoin is a subjective name, if everyone agrees on something as bitcoin then its bitcoin regardless what PoW it is, you gotta agree this. Btw I dont care the likes of Jihan agreement on which one is bitcoin. Seems this is the best way !
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:39:08
Dont worry duds, when the time comes they will just switch to original chain.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:03:56
I can excuse you for being new, is it the case ? Do you even know what it means to signal and activate something ? Its optional after segwit is activated not when its signalling so we can tell who is us and who is you and Jihan trash minions
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:30:42
you are....LOL....1 - 2 - 3 bitcoin no need for brain anymore
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:29:12
Or maybe they are those crappy bcash users trying to get back in bitcoin. Don't let them get back in ! :))
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:25:01
Go ahead and call bcash bitcoin if you want
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:38:04
Its about community. UASF has major community and 2x and bcrap has china in them. So yea, UASF won and chinese miners can now wake up from their dream if they still want to stay in bitcoin

Can you please stop embarrassing yourself ? Is this how you live pretending to be dumb and spout out imaginary reasons ? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:39:06
Many people have tried to avoid PoW change attack on moterfker Jihan group because doing so would likely hit other innocent miners as well who invested a lot in ASIC hardware.
Since the situation has turned out like this and that likely 90% is on Jihan side, looks like the perfect time to destroy this moterhacker Jihan group by doing a PoW change that effectively can only be utilized by GPU and/or CPU. Pretty much similar to other alt coin PoW. It is extremely hard, expensive and risky for Jihan to pull this miner bullshit with GPU/CPU PoW again because he risks losing it all if Nvidia or AMD ever steps in.
The community could then proceed to compensate fairly to the 10% miner that got hit in the PoW.
This would totally finish Jihan, DCG or whatever potential hostile group may come up, effectively sending bitcoin to another world ! 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:56:39
Stop spouting nonsense, go and talk to Jihan Wu already plz
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:01:07

@_date: 2017-08-01 09:20:21

@_date: 2017-08-25 13:22:21
Bitcoin price today is partly thank to its decentralization. Laying bigger pipe, bigger block, will reduce the capacity to run a full node which verify and enforce network rules. So yea in bitcoin, you lay bigger pipe, you pay for it with reduced decentralization. If you still dont understand, go tell Jihan and Ver to suck it for you
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:45:42
Not all miners are crazy like Jihan Wu. I don't think bitcoin values all stay in hashrate. Its more like hashrate follow bitcoin instead. Try thinking if you were to build some computers or miners to mine crypto, you want the real bitcoin, the decentralized, open source with most skilled developers, basically the coin you mine must potentially valuable and profitable.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:59:47
Is this the same segwit that will break ASICBOOST from the motherforker Jihan Wu ?

@_date: 2017-05-31 16:20:15
Wrong, the block was on bitcoin getting out of exchange, they could still withdraw to fiat thats why bitcoin price at the time dropped a lot. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:26:12
Yea i did. Is there anyone holding at least half a coin, doesn't know it will eventually rise ? This kind of news is really harmful to newcomers causing them to sell at wrong time.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:56:05

Yea, they are saying "Ohh....visa process thousands of transacs a second...bitcoin...so slow...". They should've googled it a bit harder instead of using a few seconds to guess the fact.
In visa, its faster because your the buyer dud, if your a seller, its only faster visually, slower literally 6months due to visa rule of chargeback rule.
Cant say which is better overally yet but each has its own market atm.

There is no talking with those chinese CEO and government bullshit. I have some good chinese friends but a big chunk of them, especially the higher class, are piece of shit.

Yea, i have money worth 1 coin at $3000 waiting for clear bank limit and now it droped to 2200 for me to buy. Thanks for the cheap coins everyone :))) best day
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:29:59
yea sell to publick but delay shipping. Have you bought 1 before ? At least furry dont do things they can't do properly.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:15:22
What kind of sick game is this ?
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:05:57
Isn't multibit an open source software ? if it is, it must be able to export private key or you may have to seed or update the wallet and do a complete transfer to another wallet created by Electrum
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:24:47
You have a point but for some cases, paying with bitcoin is a better option for other reasons beside speed
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:39:16
follow soon of course, all in china....
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:09:39
You must be using old-ass electrum or you have lot of mini payment in your wallet from online casino or faucets. Shouldve sumed up your wallet while the network was more free last few months lol
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:14:22
I believe now is lowest as it can be during this month. Buy in before it goes up
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:49:57
Yea, whats your intention asking why bitcoin has longer confirmation now and why not use visa card and all the shit while saying u bought it in 2013...funny af
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:51:39
Impossible. Chinese goverment is behind those bitman shit
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:18:13
Their a bunch of morons who discuss things with emotions and anger instead of intelligence and facts. Dont waste your time
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:59:04
just a small amount is ok i guess. Try bitpay if it has android version
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:37:17
Anyone here trusts chinese goverment and their reach or chinese dictatorship-style Jihan Wu bullshit ?
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:53:52
If prefer simple, use latest bitpay wallet - More control, Electrum. Dont use any thing else unless going for hardware wallet. Refer to bitcoinfees.21.co  for the fee vs waiting time.
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:04:09
Or isnt it because they said it too loud and on a news website, all new people took it for real ? If they didnt say it, would it happen as much as it did ?
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:01:11
Are you using latest electrum 2.8.2 ? Close and retry the "increase fee" button. Otherwise, wait 1-2 days..
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:18:28

"7,40087599" is this 7.4 coin or alot ?
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:39:13
Sorry i dont know, you can try to google it out. Make sure its open source and popular. As far as i can say, android is not really good for financial activities. I have seen news some people getting hacked on android phone and lost money.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:36:36
Heard they talked about bubble .com or something, right ?

Who the fk is he to say that ? Dont post misleading shits without hard facts.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:19:18
Damn right
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:22:38
missed it
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:15:24
Its more stupid to use crazy wallet like blockchain and do transaction during the busiest time of the week. You cant get cheaper fee that way. Ever heard of Electrum ?
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:31:59
Never trade with the ATM unless really needed. Go at least with localbitcoins or something else for better quote. Use latest electrum or bitpay wallet for accurate fee.
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:07:49
This picture looks a lot more funny from afar
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:08:21
I think you don't even belong here let alone asking me why. For your reference, I did bunch of Paypal, payza, chargeback and all the shits you never seen and you asked why i waited 30min for bitcoin...lol
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:24:36
bjman, are you fking bitman or something ?
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:15:13
The fee has gone up more during recent months but not necessarily 10. Try to use a more decent wallet like electrum where you can adjust the fee for your preferred waiting time. Sometimes fee estimated from bitcoinfees.21.co is more accurate and you will be fine either way. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:52:32
I can say that if you carefully plan a transaction, it may cost just about $1-$2 for 30m-1hour wait. Tested using latest Electrum wallet + fee calculated from bitcoinfees.21.co (weekends or US time has less fee)
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:12:58
Jihan Wu can suck china coin and control coin for all i care. Lets remove this fking centralized shits out of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:47:25
Funniest comment ever

Yea fking shady son of a bitch, thats correct
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:16:33
Bitcoin is backed by me alone :))
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:47:57
Same question, same concern over 7 years.
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:37:43
$1-$2 average for 30m-1h. 192b transaction
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:30:33
Shameless punks, anyone want to buy my EliteSKT coin, just 1 cents only till 1 august.
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:59:30
They are funny as f and the people that unfortunately believe in them without any technical or logical thinking are just....unfortunate
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:14:23
Yea, let bitcoin get fk by Jihan Wu to be china coin and we can finally see bitcoin price stop or inflating forever
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:23:03
I think if one is not clear about the whole bitcoin network, its best to stick with latest bitpay wallet and you will be fine
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:10:22
Same here, my 95% of my current funding right before dip, 5% at its lowest. Didn't regret shit, more time for outside fun instead of on computer while waiting.

More like they belong to btc and bank sub than bitcoin sub you mean ?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:54:44
Yea, otherwise how the hell am i going to buy more. Need some cheap coins man. Sadden to see its not dropping more and Australia ran out of coin.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:38:54
Signing something and actually doing it are not the same thing
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:29:08
If you google technical details on top popular coins, you will see that only bitcoin and etherium has long time potential value. Thats why i only recommend to invest in the top 3 popular coins.
You are free to invest in what you like. Its just my opinion.
I like Monero too but didnt invest it in. Its like the fifth or something lower in popularity and capital value.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:21:30
The coin in pictures smiling as it gets away from a noob owner, fall down to another hand who holds him better
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:13:38
As much as I love segwit and UASF vs the slow as MASF, I must press as long as someone can connect to a node, the network works so having more nodes won't make as big as a difference compared to having more mining hash rates. If the mining hash rate isn't enough after UASF, im so worried if we could get forked ourself to another chain and transactions not working or not working safely. Maybe we should push for more mining hash rate instead or rather, a more efficient miner that supports segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:03:43
What bitcoin wallet did you use for the transfer ?
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:04:32
Well said
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:08:34
Minus the fact that Bitcoin will be run by people like you only and centralized around you people. So minus the fact you don't understand bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:51:45
Time your transfer and preferred waiting time. Refer this info bitcoinfees.21.co  (90% accuracy) 
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:34:19
Hope everything will be good again but he coming back will make some sort of centralization effect, don't you agree ?
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:32:41
Im sure it won't change anything for me. What a clown 
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:27:58
Have you used "bitcoinfees.21.co" to plan the withdraw process as well as suggesting the correct fee for users ?
Theres nothing can be done to fix that trouble at the moment.
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:42:28
Yea, You cant dely Fiat yet as those fiat right now are equivalent to bitcoin-second layer lighting shit that we are waiting for and exchanges are just the gate to it. Am i right ? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:44:54
Oh, to be more clear, Ive been talking about fee as bitcoin now is never about the amount money you buy or sell, its all about how many transactions you make. From exchange to personal wallet, no problem, from wallet to another wallet, for $1-$2 fee will take about 30m to 1 hour.
Just use bitpay for simplicity or Electrum for more tech control.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:35:20
Thats unreasonable small
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:41:26
Just hold and you will have it doubled
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:14:07
Lol, dont use that bullshit wallet, use Electrum, I only paid an average of $1 for 30m to 1 hour confirmation.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:07:20
Only if they try to steal your coin. I think they are cutting on the fee so you can expect 1-3days delay as the worst case
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:08:27
Are you with JihanWuWu or what ?
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:43:02
Not your fault but u could to try to optimize ur transaction and choose a fee that matches your preferred waiting time.
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:54:28
change the fee down and wait a little longer lol
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:56:32
Use that site and select the scale to "BTC/byte". Use the preferred fee/byte there and multiply by the bytes of your transaction. A typical 1 input 1 output transaction is 192 bytes, a transaction with a change will be around 226 bytes.
Have to do this because electrum is not yet accurate at fee estimation and its custom fee is quite useful.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:02:58
Dont ever buy or believe anything bitman or batman. It won't end well unless you can't leave china
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:57:27
The fee has become higher indeed however you could keep it a lower by using Electrum wallet + fee estimated from bitcoinfees.21.co  that matches your preferred waiting time. It doesn't really cost $13....poor choice and optimization
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:49:02
Count me in for this shit. No china coin, no JihanfkWuWu coin and hell even no EU coin. I only belong to the coin of Decentralization and Open-source Community. We all know what it is. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:23:48
This ding-dong boy is young, ignore him
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:33:29
They also makes it look like there are more support for their trash BU proposal while most of those mining companies are in china. Laughing stock with no shame, china.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:12:07
This dumb nut instagibi obviously hadnt read anything about bitcoin history before posting his ridiculous post. I dare you to disprove me what Jihan Wu did, I dare you !
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:30:14
You already missed the damn drop last weekend boy. Too late for the party.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:59:41
Your talking like BU forks and those centralization moves. There is no "do or die" in a peer-to-peer network, thats only for government-to-citizen network !
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:52:14
I believe that witx2 is privately decided and the code is also private. If true, it sounds just wrong
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:57:30
Where can i see the link for more info ?
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:19:05
Being poor does not make it right to shill lies and nonsense to people faces. Dont ever listen to anything without evidence, fork off...
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:05:08
Its getting hard and risky without either majority support from economy actors like exchanges and wallets or miners which is unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:58:27
According to my source, you should wait a bit the price will lower to 26xx or 2700 then you can buy
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:50:31
I bet all my shit that you don't know crap about programming and project planning. That shit wont end well
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:08:02
0.0003 is the minimum these days whether you want it 1 week or 1 month or.....
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:00:29
Turn on coin option in electrum you will see your coin input, always try to spend a whole input anywhere you can the withdraw the remaining back to wallet. Assuming your exchange bit fee is about 0.0005.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:25:54
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:22:08
Lol if you can believe this shit your not qualified to invest in anything
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:18:33
I can confirm that using this graph is more accurate than Electrum wallet fee estimator. Almost 95% accurate 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:22:54
Get the fork off bitmain and moterfker jihan. Lets destroy them and protect bitcoin.
I don't care how or when you all do it. Please keep bitcoin to its true value, decentralized and stable the way that its supposed to be.
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:33:00
No one can help "personally", I suggest your sender restore his wallet to latest Electrum and increase that transaction fee to 300sato/byte. If possible, connect to helicarrier EU node, you will be sped up significantly. Donate to 1H7XpDVpg2GAGv2gaAcMGQSJXGEpA6NUEL  if you find my post helpful
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:23:22
Fking agree, those fking miners in china are the reasons, why increase blocksize instead of fee when you could have sidechain serving other purpose ? For centralization and control for chinese government of course, try reading long enough you will see Jihan Wu is just a dumb face for the real people trying to control bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:20:43
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:11:37
False advertising it is
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:50:58
They realize doing business is not playing chicken. I fully support segwit but not suicide move, this needs more chances of success
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:00:41
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:49:20
Bitcoin service is provided by miner electricity so the only cost is with developing or maintaing the software to "store" the bitcoin which is...not very costly. You tell me how those free linux OS gets paid then.
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:02:44
It doesnt give you cheaper fee, it gives you more control on how to choose an appropriate fee
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:38:38
Transaction ID ?
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:11:39
Electrum wallet all the way, no idea why people keep using some out-dated ancient wallets like blockchain, hdbit and shit, those things dont know a bit about real-time fee
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:49:55
Well, theres no equal competition for you in terms of wide-scale acceptance, high security data by mass mining, top dedicated developers, highly decentralized nature...
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:15:15
Lol thought u asking for an opinion to choose something :))
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:17:02
As long as bitcoin stays decentralized, thats where all my money stay
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:39:20
Yes its common but not for exchanges. Your exchange must suck a lot to be that slow and theres nothing can be done as they are in control of the bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:32:56
As easy as sending all your coins or sweep private key. Sometimes, seeds arent compatible. Time your transaction right and the fee will be much cheaper
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:50:53
Nothing is going to rock or split with that little mining power. Had high expectation with 148 but it turned out to be mere talk and no action, seriously
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:26:11
It will be a slow up but still up
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:12:56
Yea, they are just too young to understand it
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:56:44
They are big business so you can expect this as a fact otherwise it will damage their reputation a lot which is not a wise thing for them to do
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:05:16
Damn right
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:47:22
Perfect timing, now he can implement bitcoin without fear of any fork
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:28:28
Backup your wallet and reinstall electrum with latest version, then click increase fee. 
Refer to bitcoinfees.21.co for your fee with a preferred waiting time
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:40:22
What ? WHY ? I was waiting for it to come down to buy some more ? Whats the reason for sudden drive ?
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:16:37
Yea you can sell your ass for etherium for all i care
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:28:51
First of all, you need to distinguish point of sale and wallet. Coinbase is a point of sale for bitcoin ...as well as wallet. I assume you have no other choice and need it for coin purchase. I suggest you buy from localbitcoin (not sure if its cheaper now) or keep buying at coinbase but only withdraw your coin at weekends and use Electrum on your desktop to store your coin in long term. Later on you can use Electrum for other bitcoin transaction which takes much lower fee...
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:05:06
Well said
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:32:15
thumbs up for the centralized chinese miners. Lets put an end to the chinese and show them what bitcoin originally means.
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:09:00
Dont use any wallet besides Electrum. They don't know accurate fee and you can't put in custom fee.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:54:20
If thats true then all of their whole fricking stupid BU, Chinese dictatorship is super shameless and talent-less which had to use such cunning methods 
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:29:35
It can come out but slower than before. Its faster for more VIP people if u know wat i mean
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:04:00
Your blockchain wallet haven't received btc ? If you bought with credit card you can expect some delay however 2 weeks is a little too late. Call their phone support, no answer means you got scammed and need to contact bank for a chargeback. If its bank transfer, it's beyond me...
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:16:30
Evidence please ?
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:10:07
Genuinely funny
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:29:51
To make it easy, just remove all of that and install Electrum wallet instead and restore or send your coin there. Smaller and cheaper fee
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:36:00
You have to wait out for the thing to return automatically. Don't open your wallet until next week. Using electrum can increase the fee, not sure about other wallets
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:07:03
Calling people trolls and shit and didn't look at yourself dumbass, what did you contribute and whats your references for saying such nonsense ?
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:12:11
No boy, its all because hes biologically chinese, physically in china, talk like chinese (fk ur moter if u want fk &lt;-he said this) and did all the lies &amp; shit
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:55:50
Yes too low. Restore your wallet to Electrum and increase the fee
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:13:24
Fking Jihan Wu, you wouldnt say that after you see him saying "Fk your mthe...if you want fk" literally in broad daylight public on twitter for everyone to see in respond to a normal comment.
This guy is a cancer in bitcoin universe, potentially backed by chinese government, with proven records of lies and deceptions.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:30:50
Well you said it. Electrum is your answer, no ad, no bullshit, open source, I tried to donate but thats not even an option.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:22:40
Fking chinese miners are like that, not surprised at all.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:07:01
They even put ad in your app man as if that wasnt enough. This entity cannot be trusted with your precious bitcoin ! You ve been warned
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:41:05
Tell her its not her daily bread so it won't be on sales lol. There is only a good time to buy, not a time when it become cheap.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:45:26
Have you ever used a bank app that has ad on it ? This is just wrong and one is asking to get hacked by using these funny software to manage their finance. Move all your bitcoin at once !
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:10:26
Hot damn im all up for this, bring it on
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:41:51
Yes it is normal if you used low fee. Whats your transac ID ?
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:47:38
Fking cheap scammer, your the most stupid here hoping to scam other people, dream on
