I'm completely dead on the inside.

I mean is it really the same if the coin intentionally markets itself to confuse people that it's BTC?

The machine I referenced earlier promises to pay for itself in 45 days based on current prices, do you think that's realistic or just them trying to sell me some shit?
 Where I'm at is we just gifted a ball python to a family member and got it off our electric bill. The heat lamp just came off the bill but the power consumption would be similar. (Right?) I figure buy one and turn it on for a year and maybe end up ahead of the extra 60/month on the electric bill we're already used to paying?
By the way I really appreciate you taking the time to respond to me at such honestly and length. Means a lot to me.

If you're ignorant to it's value that's your own fault at this point.

You're really foolish if you think this president does anything for any altrustic reason beyond "it lines my own pockets," or "fuck that black guy who was here before me." Dude is the living embodiment of ignorant/selfish cronyism.

I bought in at 19,616, obviously too close to the ATH (thought that at the time but I could've bought the night before so fomo took over if I'm being honest with myself) but could you help me better understand how I would make a better decision in the future? Or at least set me on the right path to making better decisions?

How do you guys think the increase in prices has effected the profitability of mining, i.e. if you were to buy the top of the line miner at 1.6k tomorrow, would that make you more money investing it or simply mining it? What are other  factors to consider?

Tell me how you and the bank feel about it when your dog shits all over the carpet, a stranger breaks a window and runs away, or something else non-catastrophic happens.

I think there is a lot of practical use for the technology, where it goes in terms of price cieling, I don't really have a clue, 20, 30USD? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:33:13
True but I don't think that makes it a "this or that," proposition. Any mildly educated trader knows they both do different things and won't eat one another's lunch.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:26
I'm in at 19616, so you're not alone. I've been here before. Just turn off that part of you by buying more.

BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE
COME ON AND BREAK ON THROUGH
Seriously though I just bought a little more like an hour ago so let's get me back in the green on that. Visualize success everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:15:06
What makes you think the two are even vaguely related in terms of success? They literally serve two different functions.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:39:51
Baby I'm buying this dip shit. Almost out did myself 800 on the position I bought yesterday.
Lesson learned for next time. Little less bullish on payday.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:57:33
What would you say your overall personality is an investor? Just trying to contextualize your pov.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:01:59
Dude don't panic sell assets. We just saw a 3x increase while most experts are still telling you LTC is tremendously undervalued. HODL diverse.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:20:31
What do you mean exactly by "eat my lunch?"
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:18:50
Any articles or literature in particular?
Thanks for taking the time to write all that. I thought we'd hit 20k and hover not take a dip.
You said there were "1.2k btc sitting around that 20k mark." What do you mean, and where do I find that info? I use coinbase currently (waiting on gdax to work) so all I see is price/graphs.

Posting to Snoop on what other modelers are saying.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:37:45
Check your transaction history and see what you bought it at.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:30:23
Wouldn't you want to wait until it went mainstream first via futures and got more people into it, then dump? My thinking is the futures trading is going to pump the market naturally itself, since more exposure=more interest=more investment.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:08:30
Hmm, that's a pretty good insight. What if you flipped those miners to LTC. Do you still feel that way?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:58:55
I'm not entertaining that conversation dude, take your tinfoil hat shit elsewhere. You really think that a fraudulant birth certificate made it past the CIA, FBI, your government agency of choice, but not the one genius who happens to agree who your outlier political theory? And the last time I checked, being born here isn't the only condition for having US citizenship, if either of your parents are a US citizen, like his Mom was, you automatically are a US citizen, no matter if you're born in America or the vacuum of fucking space, it doesn't matter.
Because the top ten wealthiest  people in the world control the amount of wealth as the bottom 50%, and while they sit on billions and stash them in offshore tax havens, we have millions of homeless vets, starving children, municipalities without clean running water, and an undereducated populace. Letting the wealthy get wealthier is not only morally bankrupt, but the last time they were this much better off than everyone else,we experienced a little something called the Great Depression.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:24:28
I do want tax reform; but giving a massive tax cut to the already wealthy has never ever ever in the history of the world worked one time to help poor people. More of our tax burden should be on the rich rather than the other way around. I am tired of a tax structure that has created an oligarchy. The new "tax reform" brought by the Republicans is in the direct opposite direction of what I actually want.
And he's now trying to (again) say Obama wasn't born here. If you can't see the blantant racism of the President, that's on you buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:55:00
How long term do you think it would realistically be till that happens?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:26:49
Well terrorism is real, it's just that nobody does it because "Allah," or "I'm evil and hate freedom."
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:37
Uhh yes. That's why a lot of us invest in it.

I was calling them "Wentz Dollars" for like 45 minutes.
