I thought about this, but I don't think it's necessarily splintering the Bitcoin community.  The point of the subreddit is to promote local business, not act as a platform for more speculation of price, announcement of news, etc.  I guess I see it sort of like going to your local Farmers Market to see what everyone has to offer.

I mentioned that US based people should use CampBX.  Feel free to use whichever exchange you like. I'm just highlighting that CampBX works for the US

I have bought 4 times from Coinbase in the past three days. Just a matter of luck I guess

Wondering the same thing.  I got cold feet on this - bought at 1.89, saw it drop a bit, sold at 1.85 and now its at 1.2..
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:33:51
Didn't seem to hurt us too bad :-)  Good for you though!

Hey, I own a Moog etherwave myself and I just want to say even though it's not the most 'practical' instrument in terms of jamming, most of the film scores i've written include my theremin in some way.  I hope the buyer is an enthusiastic musician who will respect it :-)
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:31:03
Experiment = success!  It's not a real thing, I just manually typed that text out, but I was also curious to see if people would be interested in a Gamblebot...not that i'm skilled enough to code one myself (HELLO DEVELOPERS)
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:52:43
Good sir, I believe there's a syntax error on line 12 - should be var quantity = 10; instead of var quantity: 10; correct?  Anyways, works great, thanks so much!

ASICMiner is the way to go, but their shares are on the up and up literally right now.  I have 3 shares of AM, I got them at [BTCT.co]( 
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:03:04
You guys realize that the mainstream media is bought and paid for right? Something like Bitcoin is going to be smeared and obfuscated purposely without making it TOO obvious to the masses that they have an agenda against it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:36:39
I'll probably get some flak for doing this, as it seems a lot of people now are, but you can sign up for [CampBX via my affiliate link]( which will give you 10% lifetime discount on their commissions (and I also get a 10% share of their commissions).  So full disclosure - the above is an affiliate link, but I use CampBX and haven't had a bad experience yet.  Way better than MtGox if you're based in the US. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:22:35
Which store?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:24:29
Wow, thank you bitcoinbillionaire...I will make good on this tip somehow, I promise that to the community!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:07:31
I am holding.  The quality of my life has not changed, and will not change even if BTC reaches $0.  I believe in Bitcoin, and I want to stand with its proponents.

Would someone care to explain how we go about cracking it? Like where do I enter the address and guess the password?
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:48:04
Ah, whoops. In that case I'll delete it. Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:09:51
What makes you so sure? Just wondering
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:51:52
If you want you can just tip me half of your BTC and I'll play Satoshi dice for you ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:42:59
[TAT.ASICMINER]( on BTCT represents 1/100th of an ASICMINER-PT share.  So if you don't have 2.5BTC to spend on an ASICMINET-PT share, you can instead spend .025BTC on 1/100th of a share.  The prices I just mentioned are just to help you grasp the basics, but they are bound to fluctuate and not necessarily in relation to the other.
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:12:25
I have high hopes that all the new Bitcoin millionaires will make such progressive decisions. I know I would :-)

First, let me ask - how old are you?
@_date: 2013-03-19 04:56:46
I agree with this.  I believe that the government uses the 'slow creep' method of passing restrictive legislation - it will take (possibly) years of little laws being passed and then at some point we'll look back and remember the good ol days.  Considering the recent trends, Bitcoin is now actually a threat to precious central banking. The government will not just sit back and allow it to grossly outperform the dollar.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:28:27
So what's your experiment? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:48:17
Coinbase is not going to steal money from you. Relax. They are trustworthy - I can vouch from personal experience (they are literally the only place I get my BTC from, since I don't day trade) and they are also very willing to refund/correct errors.  And yes, they do make errors. But they correct them.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:29:12
Go with Cavirtex.com
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:30:32
Make sure to tip back some of those earnings if you plan on crashing us with your 111,111 btc
@_date: 2013-03-08 06:13:09
Thanks for the explanations also.   I kind of see this as the paper wallet being the bank account, and then other wallets on your computer are sort of little areas to hold 'spending money'.  So how do I "withdraw" or send BTC to another account from the paper wallet? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:38:36
Ah, you are correct. Sorry for the confusion

**Disclosure**: Shameless affiliate promotion, but also trying to help you out
You can sign up for CampBX through my [Affiliate link](  and you'll get the 10% lifetime discount on your CampBX commissions
Edit: Didn't see the other guy's link up there.  Well now you have two options :-)
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:47:18
Well, that's just the way it is, but don't make it worse by chasing your losses by gambling more. That is not reasonable, rational behavior.  Instead, cut out the emotion, roll with the punches, and learn from your mistakes.  Be a man about it (no offense).  To be honest, buying Bitcoin is a gamble in itself, albeit a more long term gamble for most.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:12:43
Ah yeah, it's no phishing attempt.  It's a mutually beneficial affiliate link.  But if you don't feel comfortable signing up through my link, just go to their site directly: [ - I won't be offended
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:39:59
Just relax. First off, you're only 18, you don't know shit about anything, and I can tell you that losing 600 to gambling is NOTHING if you STOP RIGHT NOW. If you're going to buy bitcoins, then what you should do is make a really inconvenient cold storage wallet, and send all your BTC there the moment you get your hands on them
@_date: 2013-06-21 00:38:22
Thanks SatoshiCircle!
My favorite thing about SatoshiCircle is the sound effects.  There is something so satisfying about the clicks of the spinning wheel, the initial pop after the 'arm' has been pulled, hell, even the sound of losing BTC isn't all that bad!
