LOL I wouldn't call it much of a bull run...it's just old news coming out now. They 100% could have sold or swapped into something else by this point.

I really feel as if LN is like a car mechanic trying to make a 1930s Rolls Royce go as fast as today’s models by completely re-inventing the internal combustion engine...idk, still seems a bit over-sentimental to me. Why does it have to be BTC? I’m not trying to trash the coin, but legitimately, why can’t eth or something else be a store of value on top of its other attributes? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:06:34
I get that, and if we were at a 50 billion dollar market cap i'd say you were right, but its 600b+ and rising fast, I don't know that these solutions will come in time at this point...as far as I understand there isn't anything all that special about BTC besides the fact that it's  I could be wrong there though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:10:32
We can ask all we want, but this market is rocketing so fast that in the months that will take it will be far too late. Same with LN I fear. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:09
But Roger has such a nice smile ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:22:50
Ahaha i'll be praying for my transfer to go through with a quickness then. Noted ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:21:11
People are FUDing out because the market is expanding so fast, and LN + mass segwit adoption are at least several months away. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:05:52
...not that this behavior really makes any more sense if it were more money he lost but it's a hundred bucks LOL
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:21:05
Are people really this butthurt about a 3k correction when we hit 17k this week? This is literally just the beginning, so grow up and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:37:05
The price fluctuations are irrelevant as long as you hodl ;) LN will solve a ton of issues surrounding bitcoin, particularly those which made the bcash drama even remotely possible
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:48
So because I am not a cryptographic programmer tirelessly working on a solution to Bitcoin's scaling problems, I'm not allowed to point out issues with the coin at all? I'm really not trying to be a dick here, nor am I fan of roger ver or his shitty altcoin, i'm just saying the problem we have has a solution, but that it's just pretty far in the future given how quickly the market is expanding. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:55:31
The market is expanding exponentially right now. We don't need a solution in three or six months, if BTC wants to keep its spot on top it needs to work now, and it just isn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:39:13
I'm curious, could BTC switch to proof-of-stake eventually, just as ETH is planning to do? Or is mining too integral a part of the system...I don't mean practically in terms of miners allowing it, but more in terms of it being possible at all
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:08:34
Are we really that sure there will be a dip? I have a nice chunk of money on its way to Bitstamp via wire transfer and I'm hoping for a good price drop, but is that likely to be in the cards at this point? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:12:18
That wasn't what I said, what I said is that from the perspective of a speculative investor, which the vast majority of people in the market are at this point, the coin has serious issues that won't be resolved in a timely fashion at this rate. 
I have nothing against the coin, it created this market and has done amazing things for blockchain technology. However, its just a fact that the block size needs to go up, LN needs to be realized, and/or segwit needs to be implemented on exchanges like Coinbase. The problem with the first is that that was already tried with Segwit2x, and the miners/community shot the idea down entirely. As for lightning network I see real promise, but that solution is at least several months away, if not more. As for exchanges like Coinbase switching to segwit, it'll be awhile before that happens as well, and given the behavior of the exchange in favour of bcash today it's not like Coinbase seems very motivated to help BTC stay scalable and effective at this point. 
I want BTC to succeed, but it's not looking good at the moment and that needs to be discussed. The market is in a critical moment right now and the fact that the lead currency is so ineffective and fraught with issues is not a good thing for anybody. This may be FUD, but its not unfounded FUD.

I think, and please don't blast me too hard for saying it, that the price matters far more in the case of Bitcoin than in other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin in most investor's estimation is primarily a store-of-value coin. There are other coins which are designed to perform more complex and multifaceted functions through blockchain tech, so when those coins lose some of their value the inherent quality of the coin hasn't appreciably diminished in most people's minds. 
In Bitcoin's case, since it's source of relevance lies primarily in it's massive market cap, when that starts to dwindle people begin to jump ship fairly rapidly. Not hating on Bitcoin, it made crypto what it is today, but basically any cryptocurrency can act as a store of value in it's stead. On the other hand, if a coin like XRP/IOTA/ETH loses a significant fraction of it's value/market cap, people can justify retaining the coin in their wallets because it has a definite use case outside of how much it is worth. Many just aren't willing to wait the several months (at least) that it will take to complete lightning network and/or implement segwit on the relevant exchanges. As speculative investors they'd rather just jump to one of 100 coins that have more upward mobility and (current) functionality than Bitcoin. 
It's a fast-moving market and many aren't that sentimental about keeping BTC on top. It's much easier to hodl a coin like ETH that isn't constantly under attack from it's pygmy younger brother, additionally. Again, not hating, just giving my own perspective on the relevance of the price. I'm sure LN will be revolutionary, it's just a long, long way away at this point and we all know how crypto time works.

Lol my bad dude

They don't take two weeks. Mine took two or three days, you probably just got unlucky for some reason...

Feel free to knock our socks off anytime :)

Bitstamp is my go-to.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:01:14
I wouldn't call it panic per se...and again I love BTC like many others do. I'm sure it'll rally once again and that LN will deliver. I'm just worried about the timeline, is all. Lots of competition out there and a huge target on BTC's back. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:55:05
Why so much comment karma and no post karma hmm ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:45:32
Bitcoin isn’t a secret agent. People pointing out it’s obvious flaws and lack of functionality are not paid smurfs or government agents lol, they’re just sensible
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:03:55
Also heheheheh...Bcash died the moment we passed the mark ;)
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:11:37
"Experts say"
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:17:44
Well i'd like to know why people don't like it tech-wise. The dishonesty of claiming it's the real bitcoin and Roger Ver's eminently punchable face I get.
