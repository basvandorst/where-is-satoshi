MAJOR CRASH SELL WHILE U CANNNNN
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:09:52
you shouldve verified first mate :/
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:29:22
But it is gonna be easy money! At least one big dip we will have man
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:22
Wait, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to go UP after those events? It's the opposite?
And even if there's a dip, by Dec 18th it will  be probably 25-30k? A dip will hardly make it go below todays price, right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:17:03
meaning there wont be more demand by investors meaning there wont be a price spike as most people believe, right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:45:35
whats a good exit strategy? Would sell back every month a % of your profits make sense?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:55:45
invest n HODL :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:43:38
In a couple of months this will be the most expensive Switch in history :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:14:38
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:04:19
So with all those the value is supposed to go up right? And what about that talk of January being the month of corrections and dips?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:05:19
buy half now and half after the futures
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:52:15
Oh I see. That makes sense. What about realising BTC gains and invest in alts? I'm 10% and my aim is 20% of my net worth.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:39
SELL NOW WHILE U CANNNN ������
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:18:46
cause the dip can still be higher than their entry point?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:21:52
That's the issue. I'm new and I'm thinking about how much I should invest. So far I couldn't catch any of the small dips (if you can even say) that happened. I want more information so see when and how much I should put into it at one moment (as opposed to DCA).
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:43:50
Yep, If he doesnt buy back now it will matter, A LOT.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:54:48
Would it be a gonna idea to sell on sunday/monday before the dip and rebuy after the crash?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:10:16
Shieeeet. It does seem that a huge dip is more likely to happen then the opposite :( And if it does fall due to the reasons in the article, will it ever recover?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:44:27
no reason for that to happen at all. charts were wrong evidently.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:37:35
or it will go long this week and crash only after the 18...
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:21
sell now while u can
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:13:41
it hasnt reached the bottom yet...
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:19:17
I think it will be more of a healthy fall...I suppose that much of the volume that got the price inflated past th 15k came from people who do not trust btc and wanted to make money. They will sell... ;/
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:08:34
those are not bip39 words though
@_date: 2019-12-06 04:51:27
wait what happens when someone deposits and gets 5 btc? How do they stop the withdrawal?
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:39:12
nothing makes sense in this post
