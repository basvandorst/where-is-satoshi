What about namecoin?

More nodes the better, right?
@_date: 2016-03-18 04:35:00
They have been stopping orders for years already!
@_date: 2016-03-22 17:54:22
It's because of classic-cloud.net allows anyone to donate to a QR code and they spin up a node automatically.
@_date: 2016-03-19 21:19:30
I still am irritated by the double standard that some posts of "business X takes Bitcoin" are removed while others are not.
@_date: 2016-03-18 06:08:59
Thanks. Never know how popular something is or if it's a scam.
@_date: 2016-03-18 20:46:41
ATMs are convienent, but expensive and transactions are tracked too much. I still trade cash with people I met on LBC years ago because it's cheaper and we don't have to file paperwork.
@_date: 2016-03-24 05:45:09
For what it's worth I've worked with BitPay in the past and they handled it like a champ.
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:10:39
At least someone is doing something.
@_date: 2016-03-19 02:13:16
This has happened to me. Move your coin into Electrum is my advice.
@_date: 2016-03-18 04:47:38
Obviously some folks in here didn't understand how coinbase transactions work. Bitcoin would benefit more from a friendly and inclusive community. Try to help each other.
@_date: 2016-03-18 20:43:28
Can anyone tell me if they have had success sending to .onion domain names using ProtonMail?
@_date: 2016-03-18 04:21:27
I had low expectations for a site named "Truth Coin" but that article was pretty good.
@_date: 2016-03-19 22:34:48
Is that the super big one they made specifically for the Pi I saw on the front page a while ago?
@_date: 2016-03-24 05:49:17
Boring as fuck.
@_date: 2016-03-18 06:29:52
This is actually good for Bitcoin.

For Tor users (Fuck Cloudflare)
Recently I’ve been working on new project to bring Bitcoin Core’s functionality to Scala. The project is called bitcoin-s, which aims to be alternative to bitcoinj on the JVM. This first undertaking is mimicking bitcoin core’s functionality inside of the Script interpreter. The script interpreter is responsible for evaluating scripts found in all bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin Core provides a test suite of script signatures &amp; script pubkeys to test against. The theory is that any implementation of Script should pass on all of the tests found in script_valid.json.
Test cases that appear later in the script_valid.json file require transaction signature serialization &amp; hashing to evaluate an OP_CHECKSIG operation. Bitcoin core builds default spending &amp; crediting transaction to check the script signature &amp; script pubkey against. My test cases for bitcoin-s will not succeed unless the transaction is exactly the same as it is built in bitcoin core.
As some one that has beginner knowledge of C++, this obvious question came to me: How do you write an arbitrary bitcoin transaction to stdout in hex format? Thankfully sipa answered my question.
    CDataStream ss(SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION);
    ss &lt;&lt; tx;
    printf("Transaction: %s
", HexStr(ss).c_str());
This is really handy when it comes to seeing what bitcoin core is actually doing — especially with beginner level knowledge of C++. Now you can see how I use the code provided by sipa to write the transaction being built by Core here.
Finally, here is the output in practice.
    chris ./test_bitcoin -t script_tests/script_valid 
    Running 1 test case...

The more full nodes the faster data propigates through the network. However, confirmation times etc. will not be improved unles miners can meet the 10 minute target difficulty for mining.
@_date: 2016-03-19 22:17:36
I generate wallets in using bitaddress for some purposes, but it sounds like you need BIP32 payment addresses. Then you can just keep your MPK on hand and not worry about your private key and could safely generate all these addresses online.

Propaganda from both sides is absurd. This is like a presidential election. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 16:38:21
Nice. Personally found YT track better 
@_date: 2016-03-19 01:18:58


People I trade with don't even know names. We met on LBC and various security/hacking conventions.


Yes, but they fill an area of the market for soccer moms, gamblers, etc. There are a shit ton of people who don't mind being tracked. I'm not really one of them, though.


I usually cash out $5k at a time paying $100 fee. This seems acceptable for not trading names at all and they wash all the coins.
@_date: 2016-03-18 03:53:57
Glad they are taking Bitcoin, but let's talk about something. What's the deal with "X takes Bitcoin" posts sometimes being allowed and sometimes not. I've seen them removed sometimes and allowed sometimes.

Was thinking about getting one of these to run a full-node on instead of some pruned nodes.

Just curious why didn't you write a seed down or save a backup? Mycelium throws these options at you very often.


You are 98% likely fucked. As others mention you can take a snapshot of the filesystem on the phone/SD card and maybe recover the data if you are lucky, but that's a slim chance and it's especially lower because you formatted the entire phone.

Sorry advertising services gets you reported. Not sure how "big" you have to be until they allow the post, but in fairness I report all commercial service advertisements now.

It's validating hundreds of millions of existing transactions. It's going to take a while.

Fuck that. Never release until cash in hand.

Some miners mine empty blocks. This just happened along with two blocks appearing at the same time. These events delay confirmations =(

I see. Why the fuck did he do all the laundering if he ended up putting his real name on the forums is beyond me.

I thought Blockstream major purpose was to create LN?
@_date: 2016-03-22 22:02:24
Even for a few days or weeks I think more nodes is better.
@_date: 2016-03-18 20:36:13
I heard it from Blockstream opponents who characterize Core devs as bought out. I can't remember the specific place, I've been all around subs and forums for the last few months it's hard to keep track.
How exactly do the investors of Blockstream get a return on their investment? Surely no investor would enter into an agreement with so much capital without a strategy to get it back, complete with exit conditions etc.
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:52:19
Prediction markets are rad.
@_date: 2016-03-18 05:01:15
Depends largely on what kind of business you have. If you accept retail payments only Bitcoin may not be ideal for you.

Just to be clear they were never linked together were they? Because pirate was later convicted as Trendon Shavers.

"Regular people" don't care about Bitcoin until they need to. If you have to force it, then it's not going to work.
@_date: 2016-03-18 07:04:33
Just get one of those basic marquees you see in shops that scroll whatever a computer sends to it and set it up to read a webpage with the address balanance every few minutes. Might even be able to get one of those spinning ones that does "3D" from Sharper Image to do it.
@_date: 2016-03-19 08:44:09


Maybe for the first trade I did many years ago, but since then I've been trading with the same folks off-the-books for years.
