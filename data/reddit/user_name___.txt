Some people who really like a movie can directly donate more to the film maker. without watching it twice in theater.

Because people want to find reasons to buy.
@_date: 2014-03-16 10:45:49
Because bitcoin is far more better than fiat.
If it is accepted worldwide it must replace fiat eventually.

no you are wrong,
I don't pay for movies really because it is really hard for me to pay in theaters. I have no time for that.
And I DON'T think that other legal way to view movies are easier than bitcoin.

Bitcoin is backed by many things, but they are hard to value.
like the idea of blockchain, fast transaction, finite amount, anonymity, created and control by poeple but not banks, and many other characteristics are unique. These things are very valuable and beyond the calculation in terms of USD.
