im a newcomer to the system. i plan to hodl, buy additional mBtc when i can afford to do so! question: when i buy a trezor set it up, transfer 0,05 btc to it and then keep it in a safe...if i buy more btc to the trezor wallet id do i need to plug the device in my pc to transfer new funds? if i didnt transfer the new funds...when i restore my old trezor from the safe (with the initial 0,05) is my balance 0,05 btc? or does the restore process know my latest funds via the wallet id? do i need to charge the trezor device or can it run out of battery? down the line if trezor gets out of buisiness, say in the year 2030 i buy a ledger quantum xl....can i restor my hodl funds to other devices? thx in advance for answers
