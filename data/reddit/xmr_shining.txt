Thanks for the article. Who would kidnap foreigners though? Random people or is it organized crime?

Satoshi was never identified. The truth is that we really don't have any clue what entity posted that response, nor why. It's just wierd to me - when people talk about "Satoshi" being right/wrong - is all.

What are the typical dangers for tourists?  Also, is the Petro- dollar cryptocurrency that we always hear about used by the people at all? Any evidence it actually exists?

Making stupid mistakes after correcting someone else is so cringey. I'm certain that 99.9% of Reddit users learned the difference between "your" and "you're" in first grade, and that they are not impressed with their understanding of this the way you are. You, on the other hand, give off the impression of having discovered this last week from a Facebook meme.

I have placed a limit order on Robinhood that did not get filled even after the price they show dropped below my limit price (definitely a limit, not a stop or even a stop-limit). Eventually the order filled at 10 cents less than my limit order. I'm not complaining in the end, but it made absolutely no sense to me how that could happen if my order went on the books immediately and was executed as FIFO.

Ugh, bro, if you stab yourself now, someone (including yourself) can still stab you in the future. Are you high?

You make the assumption that everyone currently holding Bitcoin that is also willing to sell it to you believes in it. Since this is false, your entire logic is flawed. Bottom line: buy Bitcoin if you see the potential; arguments for its potential are all around you. Also, don't worry about what other people are thinking and just do you.

You're not crazy. It's proven true that digital transcription of that call exists, and authorities with the NSA have access to it. Now, is there actually at least one living person that has accessed it already or who will? Is there ever a time where said copy could be relevant to NSA proceedings or functions and can/will easily be accessed? No one can say for sure.

I once was surprised to see Hodor DJing at a club. He sucked tbh, but it was still pretty cool.

Ha! Why not just buy the coins, make your own wallet, and slap a QR on it yourself? Is it still that hard for people? Good grief.

I want to address some idiots' analogy of Charlie Lee selling all of his LTC to the hypothetical scenario of Jeff Bezos dumping all of his Amazon stock yet remaining the CEO of Amazon.
Amazon is not decentralized. There is no reason to have a CEO that doesn't own a piece of the company. While Charlie may still be the de facto "leader" of Litecoin, he isn't the leader in actuality. This impression of him is just that: it's how the community feels about him, a choice on their part.
At any given moment, anyone or group can contribute to Litecoin in a way that clashes (or not) with Charlie's vision/ideas, and the community could then choose to rally around these new contributors/ideas.
It therefore matters not whether Lee holds any LTC. His point (while I disagree with it for the exact same reasons that I also think his decision was fine) was that he didn't want his continuing efforts to develop and promote Litecoin to be questioned as attempts to pump his own bags. I respect that,  sure.
Tell me, why can't you understand this? Are you really that mad that he sold (what appears to be) ~75% of the ATH that you cannot be objective? His timing very well could have been dumb luck, if not the result of him correctly analyzing the market. Satoshi still holds 1+ million BTC, no one knows if he is alive or dead, and last I checked, BTC is worth a hell of a lot more than LTC, yet you don't think BTC is shit because of that, do you? (inconsistent) At the very least, LTC holders do not have to fear Lee dumping his LTC anymore away some future point and causing a panic within the community of LTC investors. His decision to sell was a good/neutral thing.

You're just wrong, period. The price may indicate that it may be easier to move it in either direction at the time, but if you have $x invested, the total amount of money you lose (and pain you feel) when the price drops n% is exactly the same regardless of price. If you can't understand this, go learn how percentages actually work instead of assuming your intuition is correct.

There is no way to do it fast unless you already have an account with an exchange or you know a private vendor.

surely you see that 3.5k is much more likely to be the bottom than 20k was, and will certainly be closer to it

Unfortunately, there must be selling at these prices right now. There is no other wayt. If it wasn't selling at this price right now, no one would be buying any of it, there would be zero volume, and the price would be $0. I hate it too man, but telling people to HODL won't influence the price at this time.

I wish things were different. They will be in the not so distant future, I do believe that. A healthy Bitcoin price isn't only good for investors. It is good for the nature of money and society.

That is why I would never wire transfer money when "instant buy" and ACH transfers are available at multiple exchanges. I would not be wiring enough for the bank or the exchange give a fuck about making sure my 24k transfer is successful. Because I'm the little guy, so FML right? Who cares if that was 25-50% of my savings, because the raw amount was low compared to whale-status customers, amirite?
EDIT: I'm so sorry this happened to you. I will pray everything works out for you.

This is exactly what I'm talking about. This is the exact attitude that makes financial institutions/ exchanges turn their nose up at any request for their attention. $24k is chump change? Who do you think you are? Nevermind your opinion on OP's decision to wire that much... that doesn't make this shit OK just because Murphy's Law is a thing. People have his money at the end of the day and it's missed up that they are not giving it to him (or can't, whatever). In before sanctimonious response defending you be being a true dickhead.
