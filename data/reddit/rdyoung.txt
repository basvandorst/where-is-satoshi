Potcoin faces the same issues that btc and other coins do, adoption and use. It's the chicken and the egg, you need businesses to accept it but you need people to have it to spend. If enough dispensaries start accepting potcoin and paying their suppliers and employees in it, you can cut out cash altogether, so long as the average person has an easy way to get it.

There is a group that only sees scams. If they don't understand what your talking about your a scammer. I am sure that if JG/Gaw/etc wasn't a thing, the references would be made to mtgox, et al.
I have a hard time understanding why this reddit seems so adverse to anything new. Colored coins/open assets don't replace btc or the blockchain, they live it on, they expand it. With Open assets, 600 satoshis are locked up to represent each chunk of coins/assets, the more colored coins are used, the fewer btc there is in circulation. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:35:52
Woah there buddy. Get out of here with your logic and comprehension.
We don't take kindly to your kind round here... ;)
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:16:06
And its clear that your unwilling to educate yourself on something before making a judgement. You think that calling everything a scam will protect you from them, and your right, but your doing yourself and everyone else a disservice by refusing to learn about something and then making an educated and informed decision.
Your quoting and response to my post means nothing. Everyone who is successful, whether scammer, ponzi operator or legit has to be organized. Your also now trying to deflect away from the fact that you have no idea what a colored coin or open asset is, nor are you capable of educated and rational thought, and instead trying to make me look like I am garza.  Your a joke, why would I(garza) ask myself questions on HT and then ban myself and 5+ other usernames I was using to ask real questions and debate real issues at hand? It makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:00:48
Not sure, its not my site. But what does the registrant have to do with anything?
Read up on what ghcloud is as well as how the exchange operates and then tell me why it matters!
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:11:00
Wow, you jump right to scam without learning whats what.
NO, they aren't a cloud mining scam. GH was born out of the JG fiasco and they use it and him as a guide post, IE, do the opposite.
You clearly have no idea what colored coins/open assets are, nor are you willing to be open to what they can do.
As for the domain. There are many ways to find out who is behind it. Why would someone freely open themselves up to harassment by giving real identifiable info on their domain registration?
Are you aware that you can give completely bogus info on a domain? Are you also aware that you can hide your info for a reason?
It also sounds like your still hurting over the JG scam/ponzi/pyramid/whatever. Its high time you move on and stop painting everything in that light. There is more to the world than the JGs and maybe this experience will help you to more easily filter out the scams from the legitimate operators in any and all sectors.
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:44:24
Yep you found me. I am totally JG. So much so in fact that I have a huge pile of hashlets I am using for an office chair. I roll up the prime hashlets blunt style and use them for "recreation"
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:54:25
You are actually serious aren't you? Take a look around the net and I am sure you can find screenshots or other copies of my taking JG and the rest to task trying to get answers very early on. I was one of a few that were asking questions and quickly got banned because of it, I earned several bans trying to educate the masses and get answers from on high.
Whether or not your being serious, I would suggest you take a deep, long look in the mirror and think carefully about who you call out as a scam, as well as the reasons you base that accusation on. 
The folks behind GH as well as myself are more than happy to share who they are, where they are, etc. If you spent a minute or two on the GH forum you would see that there are very few organizations/people that are more open about whats behind the scenes than the folks at GH. 
Please come hangout at the forum, or conversely grab an invite to a slack channel I setup for my coloredcoin marketplace, I will be happy to send you an invite, or the link to grab an invite for yourself. You can even use a fake name if it makes you feel better. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:34:15
What mistake did garza, I mean (I) make more than once? Taking your money several times, for each layer of the ponzi? Did you buy into the vaporware mining hardware and then turn that into hashlets? Did you then buy prime hashlets and maybe some of the special ones that had pretty colors? 
Sounds like you are the one who keeps making mistakes. Maybe you should find a 10 year old to handle your finances for you, you might end up with something for your retirement.

Well, I sort of am making that overall point. With the tiered verification structure coupled with the alphabet soups stance on crypto, you shouldn't need to send in ID, blood sample, etc to trade crypto&lt;-&gt;crypto. I use cryptsy as my main point here, they are registered as a MSB and I trade a very high volume with them without being fully verified, though with their trade fee discounts and possible market maker status, I really do need to get off my duff and get fully verified.
@_date: 2015-05-19 09:18:49
Yes I do. Do you know what the current rulings are from the IRS/FINCEN/CFTC/Et al in regards to cryptos?
Its only when dealing between fiat and any other commodity that the KYC/AML/MSB rules come into play. This is why cryptsy doesn't require full verification for crypto/crypto trading. This is also why every exchange run by people with even a tiny bit of competence has gone with tiered verifications.
Have you actually looked at the tiered verifications at polo? Or are you trying to sound all smart by asking if I know what a swap is? Are you going to ask if I know what derivatives or bonds are next?
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:23:36

@_date: 2015-05-04 22:10:00
Yes, this is the point of the discussion, but nothing is set in stone. If you read up on all the discussions being had on this you will also see talk of a flexible block size to adapt to higher than average tx amounts or attacks.
You can look to dash formerly drk, to see one way of doing the node incentive. They pay a % of each block to a certain node, I don't fully understand how the nodes get chosen for payment, but the one I run gets regular payments despite being one of 3k or so. I don't think paying a % of the whole block would work for btc, but a decent chunk of the fees would make it feasible to run a node and keep the network functioning at its best.
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:57:43
I know I have seen a site that offers this. I found one site but it gives an api error when you try and submit the tx id.
I know a site existed for this. Whether or not it still does or if it actually works is unknown, but it did exist.
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:34:01
Yep. My favorite potential use case for smart assets is the ownership of property like cars and houses. I can see a day when a digital asset let's me buy a car from someone and as soon as they send me the asset that ids that car, I can unlock it and drive away. The same could work for a land deed or house deed, identify the asset by the gps coordinates or whatever grid system the local township/city uses.
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:31:02
Not the same thing at all. Wheat isn't ipoing and therefore trading at a higher than value rate. Others are correct in this, your better off waiting for the price to stabilize closer to the market value of btc, seeing how gbtc is backed by btc.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:34:44
Exactly. You didn't argue my point at all. You in fact reiterated it.
Again, look at the tiered verification that other exchanges use. Also look at other commodities and forex brokers in the USA, I have never needed to send in ID in any form to trade commodities, forex, etc.
Do you equate giving name, address and phone # with giving ID? It wouldn't be hard to give them a different address than where you live as well as give a GV or talkatone, etc phone  The only issue would be if/when you ever needed to get fully verified. Even with the assets I manage that utilize exchange's, I doubt I will ever need to be fully verified for 25k/day from polo.
@_date: 2015-05-17 00:58:47
The site is probably being hugged to death, I am looking into moving hosts or something to handle the growth. The site still loads fine for me, I did change the DNS over to cloud flare a few hours ago, so it could be taking longer than normal to reach all corners of the globe.
I was joking about the NASDAQ coins. But how do you know they dont exist? I could go create them right now and have a NASDAQ coin launched in less than 5 minutes + time for btc to be moved for the first issuance.
You shouldn't jump to scam before checking things out. If the site was down/non existent, how could I scam anyone?
Edit: There is NOW a NASDAQ Coin.
@_date: 2015-05-05 01:42:47
It is backed by btc. Each gbtc is equal to 0.10 btc. While one would never expect it to trade in parity with btc, it can be expected that it will trade close to 1/10th the usd/btc with a small margin for the convenience/novelty/what have you.

If you would check out the entirety of the webpage/site and not the first image reddit decided to use as a thumbnail, you would see that while we do suggest people use GHCloud over coinprism for their colored coin/open asset protocol, this is not an advertisement for GHCloud.
A friend of mine and I launched coloredcoin.io to act as a marketplace and center of education for coloredcoins.
While all of the assets we currently hold/sell are based on coinprisms protocol, we are actively seeking out worthy assets on the other protocols. With the lack of discussion for colored coins, this task is not easy. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 03:46:29
What the hell does any of the credit info have to do with any of this?
Either you are aware of the site or sites I am referring to, or your not.
If not, no big deal. 
I am going to make sure to add an addendum to my site about including the requisite tx fee. Because of what I sell, I can not and will not "ship" prior to at least 1 confirmation, "shipping" with 0 confs in my case would open me up to fraud attempts.
You might inquire as to what my store is/sells before jumping off the deep end and sounding like a know it all douchebag.
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:07:59
True, but you can still send an asset to a btc address. Coinprism at least, autogenerates an asset address for every btc address it comes across.
Its a legitimate question. I have had several people send me BTC for my crowdsales from sites like coinbase where they don't control the wallets 100%, the crowdsale then sent the asset to an address that was generated for that address from where the btc came. With coinbase, I have them figure out the total balance down the last satoshi and sweep that to any other address, this effectively destroys the asset in question so I can reissue it.
To go even longer in the tooth here. I have a wallet in mycelium that I use strictly for longterm savings, I generated an asset address for one of the btc addys it gave me and sent some assets there, I only sent assets that I control so that I can reissue whenever I need to move those funds.
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:20:23
Why does this have to be an either/or situation? Do you think everyone who swipes a debit card knows how the system works from the pos terminal to checking the account balance , etc?
Do you expect the world to adopt btc and crypto as a whole its in current form? Do you expect everyone to grasp the idea of 32+ character addresses, private keys, etc? Having bitcoin "banks" will only be a boon for crypto. Letting people buy/sell and transact with bitcoin without knowing or caring what the underlying network looks like or how it functions will let the masses join this movement with as little friction as possible. 
Whether you agree or not, a lot of txs already happen offchain and that will only grow, despite your protest. Thanks to the nature of crypto, any crypto "bank" that tries to pull fractional reserve will eventually be either called out or fall under the weight of too many withdrawals to the main chain. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:13:11
Yes, gbtc is backed by a store of btc, each gbtc is backed by 0.1btc. I never said that the price was pegged to btc. I used the word expected, because if you understand market dynamics you would expect it to eventually come down to a price close to that of btc, if he doesn't increase his holdings of btc to allow more gbtc to be issued and sold, it might eventually implode under its own weight if it flies too high.
You clearly lack an understanding of market dynamics and I am not in the mood to teach you. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:34:59
If its backed by btc, it should reflect btc in pricing with a small markup for the convenience of buying OTC.
@_date: 2015-05-05 01:14:41
Actually, deflation is good. Its inflation that dooms all currencies past and present.
You sit on a high horse and almost had me agreeing with you, but its clear your another of the folks who don't understand market dynamics at all.
@_date: 2015-05-28 00:33:28
I feared that might be the case. Doesn't to hurt to keep hoping and looking though.
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:33:24
We just sold out of that coin, but you could create one and send me a few.
Edit: Why the downvotes? I was joking, sort of. Maybe people here aren't familiar with colored coins/open assets. We are here to help fix that.
Edit2: NO we don't sell the NASDAQ coin. Why? Because it didn't exist. And NO you can't choose your color, thats not how colored coins work. Color is just a way of saying that the coins are marked in the blockchain, like marking a deck of cards so you know which card is which.
Now there is a NASDAQ Coin, but we won't be selling it because it offers nothing. I created it a few minutes ago to prove a point.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:06:45
I should have elaborated a bit more. I have a web store,someone paid with 0 fee tx. It sat for 4 hours before it finally confirmed. In this instance I can't resubmit as it wasn't my tx.
I remember seeing a site that would let you do add a fee to an existing tx. This is what I am asking for.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:43:00
In theory yes. If an asset is actively managed and paying dividends of some kind, there should be someone to contact. If the asset one day gets "delisted" and stops paying dividends, why would you need it reissued?
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:04:51
Or, you could buy and hold btc yourself. You would pay the market rate, not 50% more, and you can buy as little or as much as someone is willing to sell.
Don't get me wrong, funds, derivatives, etc are a sign that btc is gaining traction and adoption, but why would I buy a derivative when I can hold and transact in the real deal. BTC isn't wheat or natural gas where you can't hold onto some yourself nor use it to buy a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:52:52
When did anyone say that we would be limiting the block size?
The average block size now is 400k give or take and we still see plenty of empty blocks. Either the problem of blocksize will be solved by btc or another crypto will take the lead. The other issue thats not being discussed is the drop in nodes, there needs to be an incentive program for people running nodes, even if it only nets them a small profit after the cost of the node, this will only help the propagation of these larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:09:07
I seriously hope your being sarcastic. While I do see 1k, 10k or 100k btc in the future, its not guaranteed that it will happen nor when. Why would you pay 380/btc now for the hope it goes up when you could pay 250 now and if/when it does go up your profits are larger. This is trading where it is because its new and its not as liquid as btc is. 
I really hope your being sarcastic, I am on my phone and can't go into the detail about markets and pricing that would like to.
@_date: 2015-05-19 07:27:11
Has anyone else taken a second and thought this through?
The tiered verification that polo/crypsty and every other serious exchange is using is actually feasible. With cryptsy you only need to id if you want to trade in usd and get the bigger discounts on trade fees. My bet is that polo and bittrex will follow this same lead. Has anyone here actually looked at the verification requirements for polo before running their mouth?
@_date: 2015-05-17 00:34:26
Why? I am one of the cofounders. Please elaborate why you see a scam? We have been open for nearly a month with many happy customers. Our goal with this site is to increase the awareness of colored coins/open assets.
Have you checked out the site at all? Or did you just jump to scam because you don't understand the concept behind colored coins?
I am happy to answer any legitimate questions anyone may have.
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:33:49


Correct. But the way coinprisms protocol does it, it generates an asset address for the normal address you give it. Because the asset address is generated from and is equal to the normal btc address, there is no way to tell if an address will or is being accessed by a color aware wallet. You can store assets in a cold storage wallet or a normal btc wallet, you simply need to use coin control when moving funds so that you don't include those 600 sat txs as inputs.
As for the crowdsale software being compliant. Its hosted on and designed by coinprism, the creators of the protocol we are currently using. It works the way it does because thats how they designed it. If they had chosen to limit the sending of assets to wallets that are in control of, that walled garden approach wouldn't go over very well. What needs and is happening is more wallets and services being brought online that are color aware. The reason we highly suggest the use of ghcloud for asset management is the fact that its not hosted anywhere but on your pc, you have full control over the private keys, they use blockstrap to relay txs to the network so nothing is ever hosted anywhere but under your control. Of course this puts the onus on you to make sure your privkeys are backed up in several places, etc. But its a much more open and flexible option.
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:30:14
Let me clear something up. I am fully aware of the risk with 0 confs, IE typically 0 for most small items. If I was running a coffee shop or other brick and mortar store, then yes, any order under 100 or 200 would be done on 0 conf. I have in fact argued this point when people pull out the long conf times and say it won't work for standard retail. If you look at my post, I said "ship". What I "ship" is not physical is digital.
 
I am cofounder of a site that sells colored coins/open assets. Most of the assets we sell are income generating, IE, they pay dividends. Because of this, and because there is no way to reclaim them once they have been issued, we have decided to only process the orders and issue the assets when the txs have a confirmation or 2. This way we don't have to deal with the potential issues of getting a customer to pay us if/when their payment times out.  
Its a relatively new site, our sales and turnover isn't large enough to risk a loss on anything at the moment. Maybe in the future when I get something designed to automate the issuance of purchased assets from our store I will look at having orders under a certain BTC amount be issued as soon as the tx is seen across the network.
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:52:04
I haven't researched gbtc much but if you know how a market works, you know the answer to that.
In case you don't, arbitrage and other active traders will likely bring the price down to closely match btc, just like other derivatives and funds backed by things like silver and gold. You don't see the gold etf trading at an equivalent of 1500/ounce when gold is at 1000.
Not a jab or insult, but it seems like some folks here have a lot to learn about market dynamics. Just because you got lucky and bought at 100 and sold at 1k doesn't make you warren buffet.
@_date: 2015-05-19 10:28:15
Yes, this is why you should make sure to use a color aware wallet. However, in the event that a coin is destroyed, you can contact the issuer and have it reissued.
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:55:12
It's an option, not a replacement. We can still choose to pay from an app on our phone for that cup of coffee, but it will be easier for the masses to be on boarded.

Have you investigated this at all? The owners/operators are very active on the gethashing forum, they are also very open to answering questions if they are presented in a respectful manner.
I was able to buy a few shares of B1 before they sold out and have been getting paid daily without delay. They have also posted pictures of the S5s that represent B1.
The funding was done first by the guys who founded gethashing.com,they came out of pocket to buy the hardware and the host, then they launched an asset via colored coins/open assets to crowdsale the entirety of the hashing power to those that wished to buy in.

Actually no its not a webwallet. Its a browser wallet. 
GHCloud using blockstrap tech to run and store everything in your local browser backed and encrypted with salt. Neither GHCloud nor blockstrap ever have access to your keys, funds or anything else. You also have the option to pull down a backup of your keys and import them into any btc wallet of your choosing.
