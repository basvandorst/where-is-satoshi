I've been known to do that heh


Ah so in Step 1 the Seller A is actually buying this from Buyer B and selling it back to Buyer B in a later step?  That means technically Buyer B already has the money but that changes with forward settlement.
Yeah not sure about that one.  But thanks for helping me understand the original premise!

Lol wait until your friendly neighborhood Christian finds out the word for God in Arabic is Allah (edit: and that Arab Christians call God by the name Allah) :-)  That'll change everything :-)

Correct me if I'm wrong but the actual components of this transaction become:
1. Seller A buys X for $100
2. Sell X for $101 to Buyer B
3. Buyer B can't pay you $101 right now so he asks to pay it tomorrow
4. Seller A provides an interest-free loan to Buyer B for the $101 until tomorrow with X as the collateral
5. Buyer B repays the interest-free loan back to Seller A tomorrow and receives his collateral back
Edit: This is different from:
1. Seller A buys X for $100
2. Seller A sells X for $100 to Buyer B
3. Buyer B can't pay you $100 right now so he asks to buy $100 from you with a promise to pay it back tomorrow with $1 interest.  What's the collateral for this purchase?  Perhaps something out of the scope of this discussion.
4. Buyer B pays for X with the borrowed $100 and takes it
5. Buyer B repays the $100 + $1 interest to Seller A tomorrow and receives his collateral back.
I'd argue the first case makes more sense but can see that they end up with the same net outcome even though that net outcome doesn't describe all the nuances of the transactions.
A more appropriate analogy might be indefensible murder (e.g. pre-meditated, manslaughter, etc) and defensible murder (e.g. self-defense, etc).  They both result in the same net outcome (death of someone) but the intentions differentiate the results.

Will a dropping price affect difficulty for miners or increase rewards since each coin is now worth less?

Investing in stocks is allowed as long as the company whose stock you're investing in makes its money in ways that aren't prohibited.
As an example, any company that makes its money selling alcohol or vices such as gambling, prostitution, etc are out.
edit: Check out the Dow Jones Islamic Index for companies that are certified halal to invest in.

From an Islamic perspective, buying vehicles that are necessary (e.g. first two for a working couple, etc) and your home of primary residence are allowed to be purchased using interest.  Everything that's on top of that i.e. "luxury" for lack of a better term, require interest-free purchases.
Having said that, I've never heard about people asking to increase the price of the loan to get a 0% loan.  That's just bizarre.

I thought there was a delay between using it internally and releasing it to the OSS version of activemerchant but I guess not :-)

You might want to approach gyft.com to see if they'll add steam gift cards to their inventory.  I've never used them but it's worth a shot.
Anyone else used them who might be able to endorse or censure them?

The real news in all this is that bitcoin support will trickle down to activemerchant which will enable loads of people to integrate bitcoin payments into their applications.
