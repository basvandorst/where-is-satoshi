Damn, you understand economics more than Robert Mugabe, you should educate him. (He literally doesn’t understand economics and made a currency that is worthless)
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:46:25
It’s more like a Ponzi scheme, but there are differences. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:18:31
So? Not like he’s selling drugs.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:55:00
Cool? All transactions are already public...
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:33:06
Yes. This seems relevant, yet nobody else has mentioned it. I’m on my phone so I can’t do much, but I believe font is relative. I’ll expand more later, but if it’s a seed then size probably is relevant to the order.  Slantedness is probably another thing that’s relevant. Also, I doubt it’s as complex as people are assuming. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:25:29
I like how literally nobody answered your question. The limit is 21 million because bitcoin is obtained by mining blocks that contain bitcoin, and after x amount of blocks the amount halves and will continue to halve. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 11:53:27
Popularity, group mentality. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 11:40:30
No 
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:14:27
Sentence structure was fucked up. Mining is all bitcoin is so yes it does have to do with mining 
@_date: 2019-03-16 19:51:01
Yeah can someone explain to me like I’m a 5 year old
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:27:24
It’s literally built in to bitcoin you’re the one who needs to post on r/retard
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:31:46
You are thinking of the way mining works wrong. Mining is purely verifying transactions, the result of which is creating coins, but coins do not need to be created in order to mine.
But if there’s no coins then why mine? Transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:01:32
Amazing pun
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:34:59
No. 8 is less than ten  and that’s the point, it he said 10 there, it wouldn’t have been assumed that it’s dead, because there would have been another block.
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:54:55
That’s 140% growth. I assume you’re in agreement with me 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:23:56
I would have if it didn’t end with “that’s why most people are poor”
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:10:21
December 2017 is a few months ago are people unable to wait?
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:53:28
Yeah that was the point of asking for numbers. To point out it has grown much higher since and there’s nothing to be worried about.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:41:28
Explain it then.. all u did was show that u didn’t get the joke then sent the link
Edit: oh shit I just clicked the link. I’m stupid
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:28:13
@_date: 2018-06-17 23:58:35
*Narrator: He wasn’t*
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:19:20
Not my point. Point is everyone acts like it’s bad at $6000
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:56:41
Not why I asked got numbers. I like when people tell me I’m right more than I like telling people I’m right
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:16:19
Lol u obviously are new to this
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:21:36
And now it’s $6000. $6000 isn’t bad
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:13:48
Give me actual numbers to prove I’m wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:38:47
Quite some time starting when?
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:18:49
Just look at any bitcoin chart for yearly growth
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:04:33
Damn this might be true looking at the graph. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:07:27
The internet wouldn’t have existed if hitler were killed
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:17:34
What’s funny
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:10:12
It’s funny how a majority cause isn’t even there
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:25:10
It was humor I believe 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:21:32
Nah it’s not. When I’m high I can read the news without getting super depressed. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 18:58:15
Not adoption. Adaptation. Adoption is when new businesses just use it. Adaptation is changing to fulfill requirements. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:49:37
Yeah? I have facts saying it is better. Enlighten me with why it isn’t
@_date: 2019-06-04 06:44:56
It’s quite high up
@_date: 2019-02-17 05:29:25
All money is made up.
@_date: 2019-02-10 09:30:35
Polls? You don’t need polls to find prices
@_date: 2019-02-16 18:36:02
Adaptation isn’t instant. Also not part of it. 
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:13:13
Because it’s existed for longer
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:07:33
And fossils fuels have a future of killing everything so I don’t think it compares
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:50:37
Yeah I was high I don’t know how I read it so stupidly and made such a stupid comment 
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:25:27
Coinmama doesn’t allow NY purchases.
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:07:40
Yeah but they don’t need to follow from wallet to wallet. I think if they just tracked transactions directly from their wallet that would be fine, but even if you transfer to another wallet then buy they’ll lock your account.
They don’t need to overcomply.
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:09:26
Exactly. If the wallet just banned account for direct gambling purchases it would be in compliance. They don’t need to track from wallet to wallet. 
If you gift your friend btc and they use it for gambling there is no reason you shouldn’t be able to buy more.
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:50:27
In 69 days, 4 hours, and 20 minutes for it to be valued at $16,439.21 on bitfinex(spikes in a week, goes down, then slowly rises to $16.43k) obviously. Maybe if you were intelligent enough to watch rick and Morty you would also know the future values of crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-02 08:47:13
They don’t need 51%, they just need to be able to convince block difficulty is low so they can mine fake block and convince user they sent payment, and pocket the money. Obviously a company couldn’t get away with that, but if hackers had access for just an hour they could steal lots of payments
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:39:24
In that case just wait a month or two
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:08:03
See and that shows it’s a 15% minimum too because IE/Edge is like the most non-utilized/replaced software to ever come with a device. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:04:48
I know, I think I might be right for the first time in my life. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:38:43
I was joking, but I do wonder if this could come true if everyone believed it
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:46:33
Lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:52:02
We’ll see next week when I’m worth 50% more than I am today because I put my life savings into bitcoin for the spike.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:07:28
Many “unlimited” plans do have caps where they’ll slow the service speed down then fully stop it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:17:56
Yeah not sure how you’re getting downvoted
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:44:35
And there are sub budgets where the money gets allocated- we don’t know how much of that money is being used properly.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:15:31
Yeah that’s why you got downvoted. Shouldn’t have bitcoin if you don’t know the bare essentials
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:16:11


You two are in agreement
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:36:13
You should have told yourself. Don’t put money into things you don’t understand.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:10:36
I bet you it won’t cost less than $120 USD (with no inflation conversion) in 5 years though.... 
What we have now will definitely be cheaper though
