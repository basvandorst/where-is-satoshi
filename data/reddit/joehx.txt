panic buys in dips are better than panic buys in ATH

my thoughts on the final value of bitcoin whenever it stabilizes:
1. if bitcoin is gold, then all bitcoins will be worth as much as all gold. there will be 21 million bitcoins. golds market cap is (as far as i can tell) $7.8 trillion. so 21 million bitcoins will be worth $7.8 billion dollars, or $371,429 per bitcoin
2. if bitcoin is currency, then the smallest amount (one satoshi) will be worth the smallest amount of another currency (in the case of the US, one penny). So that means 0.00000001 bitcoins will be worth $0.01, or if you do the math, 1 bitcoin will be worth $1 million
another idea is US dollar market cap (68 trillion?) to the eventual 21 million bitcoins.

trying to buy the dip...
both the coinbase app and web site are giving me the error
    Api::BaseController::NotFoundError
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:00:33
that's because bitcoin works
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:12

cheap coin time!
$17,700 is a cheap coin....

Yes, for your situation and for now as far as Coinbase is concerned, it's as if the fork never happened.
I think Coinbase recently sent out an announcement updating their position on Bitcoin Cash that might have an affect on people who had Bitcoin in a Coinbase wallet.

His statement is equally true if you replace "digital" with "physical" -


Or even the entire noun phrase with gold:

the last big dip a month ago brought it down to $1900. Wasn't it $700 a year ago? The next dip might still be higher than what it is now.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:40:52
I bought my first about a week before it dropped to $1900. I was waiting for it to reach half of my first purchase before I bought more - it never got that low.
I should've been buying on the ride down. Oh well, at least I have some.

yes. for every buy, there's a sell. for every sell, there's a buy. they're two sides to the same (bit)coin.

It's like I have a super power.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:12:41
sorry, guys, I just bought a big chunk. it's about to drop like crazy
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:40:14
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:39:19
especially with CC coinbase transactions being rejected, and the cash advance fiasco, people can't buy like they used to

the built-in tv remote app did that to my phone. can't even uninstall it, could only disable it
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:26:12
