As far as I understand, you could run a lightning node yourself and become a lightning hub with predefined capacity (in mBTC), which means you’d be your own middleman, and I don’t see much harm in that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:27
I’d be inclined to say yes, because the goods will be attached to your name and they can figure that you have bought such thing even though they can’t pinpoint where the money came from.
But by all means correct me if I’m wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:13:36
Yeah! I caught that :)
Man, I’m expecting a crash, that’s an absurd amount of growth.
I tried trading but ended up losing some bitcoin when some whale screwed me over, I’m trying to recover some right now though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:13:16
45k now
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:01
I can see that happening, you’re right!
I will run my own hub though, just as I currently run my own Full Node, because I believe that is the future of bitcoin transactions.

Probably, as most of those run in JavaScript, and that runs on macOS 
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:04:28
Exactly my thoughts 
@_date: 2019-08-31 15:59:36
1,000,000.00 BRL would be about 240,000.00 USD and about 220,000.00 EUR, at the time of this writing, so I’d say 4 zeroes!
@_date: 2019-10-01 15:51:27
I think so, considering the other guy looks like Schmidt!
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:25:12
Many people here bought it back at 20k in 2017, so I’m sure you don’t have to feel bad! Just wait for a while and be patient.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:35:40
If you look at the address, you can see it has some BTC balance, and no BCH.
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:44:05
Considering that even with all the volatility people in Venezuela only see their money in Bitcoin increase in value each day, even in the bear market, that’s why people say that!
Their inflation is just ridiculously high, and whatever money buys a piece of bread today, doesn’t  even buy 1/4 of it tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:25:47
That’s exactly what happened to me!
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:22:54
Yeah, I’ve seen this, and regretted immediately not selling at 11k as I was intending to do haha
I’m good though, I know it’ll go up to those levels soon enough ;)
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:25:59
It’s a joke as if you bought it in BTC, because the price is too volatile right now haha
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:52:57
Didn’t know that actually! Really nice to know :)

Being used as a currency
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:04:35
You don’t need to have BTC to have a node
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:56:00
I hate myself for having done this exact thing haha
I guess we're better off hodling and waiting for new highs haha
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:27:32
I'm not rushing, that's for sure!
I'll be waiting patiently and I'll watch for the rise. I didn't put a lot of money at this time because in fact I wanted to test the waters before I went all in ;)

No, the article is from August 15th which was right after the BCH fork ;)

I don't have that in my Bread, however I'm running my own node, so I don't know whether that's the reason...
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:28:34
I had just transferred my coins to breadwallet when I heard the possibility of it going along with S2X, so I immediately started to research on how the node tethering feature could help me. After 3 Full days of syncing the core Full node in my laptop, I set up the port forwarding in my router and right now my breadwallet is connected to my node, which runs 24/7 in my laptop.
It is not a hard process and I can help you with it if you wish ;)
You could also use my node, which I'll keep on Core, however my IP is not a fixed one, so it might change sometime before the fork, and you'd need to trust me when I say I will only be running a Core node.

Delta! Great app :)

Not really doubling, as it will have different value on each coin, but sure is nice to get some free money! :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:46:40
Well, the way they're suggesting in the other comments, it's a more complicated, but certainly takes less space in your hard drive. If you don't mind having 140+Gb of space taken by your Node, head over to:  , download it, install it and open the app, this way it will be automatically syncing. If you do not have this much space available, I suggest you follow the other advices in this post about running in pruned mode.
After you are fully synced up, you have to set up port forwarding in your router and possibly your firewall too, and you have to open up the 8333 port for both TCP and UDP protocols.

FWIW the return is still pretty good, of course it isn't as much as back when the price was very low, but have you stopped to think that many people here are not only here for the profits, but also the technology behind the blockchain, and that they believe in the future of the currency?
Just my opinion here, I know that's the reason I got into bitcoin so "late".
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:05:32
Cool! :)
I did not expect starting to see those machines around here!
How does the fees look like?
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:27:44
All good. If I go there soon enough, I'll post here about my experience with the machine.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:54:43
IIRC yes

@_date: 2018-12-16 13:31:42
Cool! Nice bit of trivia I missed, thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:30:59
Thanks, that’s what I meant haha

The lambo is a joke on a man who was going to buy a house in bitcoin, and by the time he closed the deal, Bitcoin had gone up by a lot, allowing him to buy a lambo with the extra money he got in that small frame of time.
Edit: Also, Lamborghini was the first car manufacturer to accept bitcoin as a payment.
