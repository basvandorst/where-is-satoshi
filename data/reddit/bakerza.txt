China will make a come back eventually, right now we have a spree of Western Cowboys all looking for a piece of the action!

Pump it.
@_date: 2017-02-24 12:10:48
As long as you are willing to lose it.
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:56:46
What was the FAQ question? Perspective is always needed.

Nice customer protection built in there. Not.

Pick pockets delight.

The issue I have is that they continue to allow trades &amp; charge fee's knowing that nothing can be withdrawn. It's criminal really. What's more is the fact that they were implying auth to level 2 to allow withdrawals, harvesting details etc.. with no intent to payout in the first place!

Free banana massage with every bitcoin purchase.

False hope, probably be pulled.

Good riddance I say, MTGOX you are the reason we've had to wait this long for moon!
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:30:55
We'd be on 10k per coin if it wasn't for this scam star or perhaps we wouldn't have been anywhere at all?
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:31:39
For the lucky few :)

Have always run mine on Core latest ver. Pruned to 100gb.

Ya we could add this to the list of attempts perhaps -

Targeted advertising bruv.

I did however have a pleasant experience with them up till this point :)

If you looking to store bitcoin 'online' Circle is probably your best bet.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:22:49
I prefer Circle to coinbase, especially in the UK. It's not a wallet though.
@_date: 2016-01-01 12:06:38
Well not exactly but they know who I am. I guess it makes sense on their part but this has not helped my case one bit!

No bitcorn no honey
@_date: 2016-06-01 08:40:48
Circle are usually pretty good, I would imagine they will get around to your query as soon as possible. But please keep us updated.
How can you be certain that this person in fact 'sent' the payment? Was it an internal payment Circle to Circle? Bear in mind that Circle don't control the 'Blockchain'.

Real fuck destroy the system. he he he sounds nuts but talks sense!
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:47:51
You must try it even if you have to pay for it. I'm not implying that you do, but, your post does suggest... It's wonderful even for adults!
@_date: 2016-12-13 11:55:37
He was actually sacked by Barcalys
@_date: 2016-12-13 11:30:22
Sorry where do you see "blockchain.info" all the article says is that he joined the Blockchain business -  but i guess they do run the info explorer.

Bitstamp are having issues in Washington now too. The scope of regulatory issues may be growing.

Security for bitcorn will evolve alongside the technology.
@_date: 2016-12-15 12:19:16
Therefore it does make sense paying attention to USD prices.

The identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances. This is one reason why Bitcoin addresses should only be used once. Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your privacy. Ref:  
P.S Plenty of ways to buy bitcoin anonymously too btw.
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:22:04
Depends :)

Trade the big movements and trends, stay away from the sideways action. Small losses, big wins. Easy money.
@_date: 2017-06-11 12:15:42
18% and 28% mate. Anything you put into your bank account you are liable for. Sorry speed read, speed answer. I have a guy who does this for me. You need one too.
@_date: 2017-06-11 12:47:55
They are useless mate trust me. Pay a tax advisory £80 a year and release the stress. I called hmrc they didnt even know what bitcoin is.
