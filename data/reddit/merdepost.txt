Thanks for your candid responses.  I am not hoping for BTC to go away or anything.  I have always had big hopes for cryptocurrency (and still do) but BTC of late certainly has me worried.
Lightning does seem to be a compelling answer, provided it works without losing the benefits of transparency and accountability that the blockchain offers.

My concern is that SegWit is just a bandaid and doesn't solve the problem.  Especially when the wound is now bleeding out.
As far as Lightning, I understand how it could reduce fees, but how are transactions outside of the chain going to be verified/confirmed?  What does that mean for transparency and the ability to 'fudge' the record, since they are off the record?

It's ironic really. This is exactly what I meant in my post when I claimed that so many people refuse to talk about the problems.

Can you explain how a currency has any value if it cannot be used to purchase goods, services or property?

Very good point.  Although I'm sure some would try to debate this, it's hard to argue.
Gold does have some intrinsic value that a cryptocurrency never will though:  Notably, in it's unique properties as an element that we cannot create in the lab.  Electronics, and Jewelry. etc.
And the price of gold is mostly faith-based.  And you can say the same is true with any measure of wealth: dollars, euros, gold, crypto alike.

Thanks for the analogy.  In your analogy, who holds the cashier and the grocery store accountable for the register?
