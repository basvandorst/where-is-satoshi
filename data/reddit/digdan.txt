Its always fair for the winner ( and there is always a winner), never fair for the losers. The site takes 2% on all losses. 
The premise is that anyone can throw any amount of bitcoins in a "pot". After a certain time-frame the pot is awarded to a randomly chosen contributor.
Your chances of winning are directly proportional to the amount you donate into the "pot" compared to the other players.

Fun Fact: Flamethrowers are legal in all 50 of the United States, but [Kinder Surprise eggs]( are not.

How could you win against loaded dice? I don't understand why people play satoshi dice anyways. If you want to cheat a system, find one with better odds like :

Yes, and I personally think it would be foolish to try to stop that. I would rather try to help other people succeed with their endeavors than chase after malfeasance.

Why would you assume stealing? Its a theoretical question. Perhaps the the wallet is mine and I have forgotten the phrase.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:14:52
Can we verify that any of these are achievable or have been accomplished? 1 seems the most plausible. 2 doesn't seem very likely unless you tanked BTC guild.  is a good reason we need more exchanges.

I personally can't stand Digg, or mashable. How many articles can you feature about a plane crash? They are like the TMZ of tech world.
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:22:22
Brilliant. Its an obvious solution, since we should only keep track of unspent coin. I encourage this solution, and the sooner it becomes a reality the better IMHO.
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:03:44
As a solution, Checksums come to mind. Checksum a past months transactions instead of downloading all the transactions.

Think of the Bitcoin Sex Slaves!
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:21:36
Legit? 
Why would people willingly play with loaded dice?
I suggest a [quick bitcoin lottery]( that has equal odds.

Why is the blockchain file 7 gigs big? Will it only grow in time, or will there be a 'fall-off' point on the file?

I think risk is the idea.

Cam to ask why 50BTC.com hasn't paid out in a few, assuming this is the reason.

yup, people like you best stay away from free coins like this.

Correct. Once the service is rolled out then people will see how it is used. Basically, the service is for anyone who wishes to sell data anonymously.
@_date: 2013-05-08 02:29:31
I'm not selling any passwords. Use Case :
I have recently written an ebook and wish to sell the ebook anonymously. I password encrypt(protect) the ebook, and enter in my  bitcoin price and password into Bitpass.nl, in return I will be given a link. I can put that link into the package with my encrypted ebook.
Then the ebook can then be anonymously torrented, hosted on megaupload, or posted and copied anywhere freely. If an individual stumbles across this book and wishes to read it, then they will follow the link to Bitpass.nl, pay the bitcoin bounty, and receive the password. They then would use the password to decrypt the ebook, mark the link as valid and transaction is complete.
This is just one type of use case scenario.

That would be silly, since that is a vanity address. Its harder to create a vanity address then not to.

Gpu mining will die just like cpu mining has. This will leave mining up to those who invested into butterfly labs. Mining will become an investment instead of a hobby.  The investment will be worth while until mining becomes flooded with asic apps, which depends on butterfly labs and potential competitors turn around on orders. My question is why doesnt butterfly keep their products and run them themselves.

I encrypt my encrypted wallet on my encrypted partition on a USB drive that hangs around my neck. My passwords are not words, but numerous 32+ character alphanumeric(and symbols) string I have memorized. And I still don't feel secure enough.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:34:21
I do not, but the site facilitates those who do. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:41:00
Satoshidice shouldn't be played. The odds are against you. Coin Raffles and Lotteries are better risks.  is my fav

I love it when scams give me 0.02 BTC

Bankrupt? How much do you think it costs to host a bitcoin gambling service? There is a wide difference between fleecing and going bankrupt. 
Lets take a look a SINGLE dice address :  
At the time of this posting, that address has received over 900,000 bitcoins. If the house has a 2% edge, then statistically, that SINGLE address has created 18,000 BTC in revenue. At current bitcoin prices, that is $2.3 million dollars USD profit from a single address.
For a simple bitcoin script? 
SatoshiDice = stupidity tax. And business is good.
