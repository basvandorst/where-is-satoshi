Can my auto-purchase get auto sent to my wallet after the purchase?  So I can truly set it up and forget about it.

Say a Sat = $0.10 I would assume that 10 cents would be the new penny.  So that taco is either $1.00 or $1.10.

I define it as when YOU meet your dream for Bitcoin.  It could be buy a car, house or retire.  It could be when we're all free from banks and inflation.  It could be when you have 6.15 Bitcoin and brag on Reddit.  We all have our own moon.  :D

Eastern Europe my friend.  I loved Poland, Belarus, Latvia, Ukraine and Lithuania.

Look at the charts… It gradually gets momentum after the halving. In the past, it took roughly 2 years for the FULL momentum to get going. Creating such an extremely overbought Bitcoin in it’s wake. Followed by 2 years of correction. Obviously past results don’t equal future results. But yes, there were still drops after halving and yes crypto interest was lower than today. Also, just like 4 years ago and 10 years ago, everything about BTC at this point is pure speculation.

At the most basic level.  It's whatever someone is willing to sell it for matched with someone that is willing to buy it at that price.  So if tomorrow EVERYONE who owned Bitcoin decided they wouldn't sell for less than $100K but you still have buyers.... You now have a $100K Bitcoin.

Are you selling now?  If not, then who gives a shit?  Buy more!

Not counting fees.
.00298507 BTC = $20 at $6,700
.00298507 BTC = $21.80 at $7,300

This is accurate to me. I typically don’t ever bring up Bitcoin in my personal life. However, 2/3 people I did bring it up to recently said “it’s too late.”

Just wish my pull-out game wasn't so weak.

Left or right. There will be people in both groups that don't trust the governments, banks, corporations, Wall Street  and the shady elite. The main difference IMHO and generally speaking is the left wants more regulation and big government (California) while the right wants less regulation and smaller government (Texas). While Bitcoin can thrive in both worlds I feel it aligns better with small regulation and government belief system.

After proof of keys, when will you be putting some of your coins back on an exchange or start buying some again?

Commenting so I can come back to these links after my deployment and get my node up. Thanks!

I don't know the fees but I do believe if you just hold until 2030 you could be seeing that $20 turn in $3,000.  If you're looking to actively trade, then research trading platforms and prepare to lose more than you would just holding.

My opinion (which isn't based on anything because I don't have a crystal ball) is that we'll bounce around between 6.5K-14.5K the first half of the year and we'll bounce around 10K-20K the second half of the year.
