Fair enough, it's probably not the best thing to use in the description of a multiparty system, because that can lead to confusion. However I'll argue that in most technical discussions using the 3rd person plural does not compromise precision. As in most cases, a bit of common sense goes a long way.

People tend to use 'they' for a gender neutral pronoun nowadays, and it doesn't disrupt the flow nearly as much.

As we can infer from the proof oneofyourfrenchfries posted above, it's not even true. Good job, thezenpadguy.

He didn't really have a security consultant. I bet my right leg on that.

Actually, this guy's level of cluelessness is so high that in my mind he has the right to confuse bcrypt (you know, the safest option on the market) and MD5. I imagine him as a 14 year old kid copying and pasting vulnerable snippets of PHP code he finds, and this is the result.

Oh, the "swap around a couple of letters" old trick still works, apparently :P
