Is it a must for a stable coin issuer to back each token 1:1? The time of the Golden standard in the economy has gone \~50 years ago. 
As more and more stable coin issuers appear they may be considered as countries issuing their national currencies and the exchange rate depends on their ability to pay and demand\\supply.
It's not economically effective to keep cash. It's better to invest it into smth (TBills probably are the best in this case) in order to generate income and make money work for the economy.

Not such a huge move to affect shorters I suppose

It can happen to any exchange as cryptos are out of regulatory scope.

I can't fully agree with you. Hundreds thousands of transactions take place on the exchanges daily. If all of them go directly to blockchain that we'll see the situation similar to what happened to BTC this winter when it took days to settle a transaction.
Furthermore you need to trust Atomic Swap protocol (as a payment intermediary).
And if we speak about regulation (which will take place in cryptos one day), authorities will definitely prefer to deal with exchanges (and people behind them) rather then Atomic Swap protocol

The industry matures and I hope there'll be less such stories in the future. Before entering an exchange try to find as much info about it as possible. There are some resources in the internet that detect scamming exchanges
