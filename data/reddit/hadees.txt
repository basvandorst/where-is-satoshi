Yeah if this was to actually work you would have to be donating bitcoins to Greece or at the very least buying something from them.  But that does raise an interesting idea.  Greece could create it's own crypto currency and use that or even adopt a much cheaper one.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:56:59
Except the amount of people using it as a currency is dwarfed by the amount of people trying to get rich quick off speculation.
I hope the next crypto currency has a mechanism that punishes speculative trading.

I got into a heated discussion a while back on where the commentator insisted bitcoin doesn't need banks and savings accounts because he could earn "interest" on what was essentially a mutual fund you buy with bitcoins.  I was unable to convince him that mutual funds are not savings accounts.
So clearly some people on really don't understand the difference.  It's merely a question of how many.

@_date: 2014-04-04 20:23:29
Yeah I know how bitcoins work under the hood.
I think the idea of things like bitcoin are interesting and extremely useful I just think in it's current form I have zero reason to use it and in fact the rapid speculation on it's price is a disincentive for me to buy it.  I want a way of sending wealth with out fees not a slot machine.  I'm hoping successors to bitcoin will add in penalties for speculative trading and other regulatory things that get built into the equation.  Because if there are common sense built in safe guards then we'll all know what to expect.  Right now it's chaos.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:26:12
I don't think the storage of bitcoins is more secure then a bank.  You're computer can be hacked if you store them there and if you cold storage your coins you still need to store that paper somewhere.
Yeah right now interest isn't high but it won't be that way forever.  Plus what if I want to buy a house.  How do I get a loan if banks no longer exist?  Our financial industry still needs banks even if we use bitcoin as our currency.

That sad truth is the likely hood of this happening goes up with the price of bitcoins.  If Bitcoins become $1million a coin I guarantee something like this will happen.
Which is why I think Bitcoin is a good proof of concept and first step it'll ultimately be replaced by a subsequent coins that offer more protections.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:50:22
This is basically how all financial collapses happen.  Bitcoin is a bubble because people who use bitcoin won't let anyone hear any bad news about the currency for fear of it lowering the price and thus their holdings.  Jumping up 1000% in price in under a year is not what a currency is supposed to do.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:40:18
Bitcoin isn't a currency because most people involved in it are speculating on the price instead of actually spending it.

Can you blame them?  Bitcoin has structural flaws that have throne the community into chaos.  I think an open source coin is enviable but I think we are 1 or 2 generations away.   I know people with a lot of bitcoins won't like that but next gen alt coins are going to have a fix for this deadlock.
@_date: 2019-03-01 06:36:34
In theory however in practical terms we haven't really seen a mass adoption of easy ways to do atomic swaps for arbitrary crypto currencies.  I also think it's naive to assume total replacement of all fiat everywhere but even if that happens you still have stuff like gold, silver, corn, soybeans, etc.  I mean in the far future maybe it happens but there are a lot of things that all have to fall in place other than Bitcoin becoming as widely accepted as the dollar.

But i'm not a retail, i'm a business, that's what Coinbase Pro was supposed to be for and honestly their quick USD withdrawal is about the only reason I stick around.

The simple solution is not be a maker anymore.  Apparently they only want whales to give liquidity.  I'm never going to be a maker on coinbase pro ever again.

I think you misunderstand.  I'm a maker, i'm going to stop being one.  I'm big but still under $10k a month (seems a little high for the tier 1).  Although if my business goes well I'd like to be above that.  I'm not trading for profit, I'm offloading coins to get USD because running a crypto business and holding a lot of crypto is like double betting.
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:46:44
Coinbase would only go out of business if Bitcoin was the *only* currency option.  It seems pretty unlikely people won't want to exchange Bitcoin for other currencies and vice versa.

@_date: 2016-02-01 02:30:10
The real problem with ethereum is people don't know what the hell it is.  Right now if you aren't a developer you probably shouldn't be buying it because you can't really use it.  However as a develop I think it has some promise but I'm just buying enough to play with writing my own contracts.
The spam sucks, I hope it doesn't hurt it too much.

@_date: 2016-02-01 02:55:43
eh, i don't really see why waiting for it to propagate is a big deal.  Maybe it won't replace a credit card but we are talking about contracts that could live for a long time like trust funds and after a certain number of similar results you can't be fairly certain of a particular outcome.  I don't think ethereum requires you to wait for every node to run it but the more that do the surer you get till you get over 51%.
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:19:16
Don't judge ethereum by one asshole, it's actually pretty cool idea and the price of the coin has little effect on it's actual appeal.  Think of it like contracts written in code and stored in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:16:28
It was only like $1, now it's a little over $2.  If ethereum will either either go to bitcoin prices or zero.  The thing is it's a pretty good idea and the price speculation shouldn't affect the gas price which how you run the contracts.  And the contracts are the cool part.  People are speculation on the thing you use to buy gas but how much gas stuff costs to run is going to depend on the the nodes.

Yeah it's a really good idea but the price speculation is harming it.  There is obviously someone fucking with the price either up or down.  Right now it really feels like the only people who should be using it are developers and keeping the price low I think would actually attract more of the right type of people you need at this moment.

@_date: 2015-09-17 06:01:29
Aren't you kind of sidestepping the actual issue though?  Bitcoin is just a currency, it's not a magic cure for our financial system.  Sure it prevents governments from making more money but that is only a small part of a very complex system.  Banks still need to exist and they have to be able to handle bitcoins without loosing them.  Plus I bet you people are already manipulating the price of bitcoins with insider information to make a profit.  This is only going to get worse until people finally realize bitcoin is just a currency.

It is this kind of thinking that led to the housing bubble.  There is no reasonable explanation for the price increases other then speculation.  We are in a bubble.
@_date: 2011-05-22 06:55:00
Except currencies are only as good as the faith people have in them.  If you take down bitcoin i'm not sure people who lost all their money are going to be super thrilled buying into a new system.
Honestly the reason I haven't gotten really into bitcoin yet, other then I think we are in a bit of a bubble right now, is eventually someone is going to hack them and figure out a flaw and I'm not really sure bitcoin can survive that.  Even if the flaw is minor if people loose faith the value goes away.
@_date: 2011-05-22 06:38:19
I think it is more likely some random dude does it.  Everything has flaws in it.  Eventually someone is going to find something in bitcoin.  The only question is how bad is it going to be.
@_date: 2011-05-22 08:26:41
There are always other ways to attack it then just breaking the encryption.  I obviously can't know for certain there is a flaw but when you look at things like the iphone which apple keeps trying to stop people from cracking it I don't think in the long run it looks favorable.  Nothing is bullet proof.
As for the price, the amount of inflation that has happened in a year should make anyone nervous.  Those are the signs of a bubble.  Spending bitcoins still isn't exactly simple so that hefty price seems somewhat driven by speculation of future bitcoin prices.
All this doesn't mean bitcoins are a bad idea but we should be realistic about the risks.  Although I kind of wish there was a way for me to short bitcoin prices.

@_date: 2015-09-17 15:18:46
I don't see your point, of course US Dollar is just a currency.  There is more to a financial system then the currency, bitcoin as revolutionary as it is doesn't replace the entire system.  The companies handling our bitcoins lack [basic security]( which is something we come to expect of financial companies that deal in US dollars. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 22:39:45
But the value of bitcoin is coming from other people speculating on the price of bitcoin.  Like in every other market if you have too many speculators it's going to cause problems.
If you truly think Bitcoin is going to hit a million dollars a coin why are you spending it?  It might but as of right now Bitcoin seems way too volatile to be a real value store.
Honestly I think bitcoin is a revolutionary idea but I'm skeptical it can, or any currency can, survive so much price speculation.
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:31:21
What do you plan on investmenting in then? The price of Bitcoin?  If you want to keep your bitcoins in cold storage under your mattress have a grand old time.  I plan on having my money earn more for myself and that'll require some sort of investment vehicle.  Also nothing is stopping a bank from issuing a bitcoin loan derivative, in fact I'm going to assume it'll eventually happen since nothing really precludes it.
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:51:24
The problem with the derivatives wasn't transparency it was complexity and bad loans.  There is no amount of functionality you can add to bitcoin to guarantee someone doesn't sell you a bad loan.
@_date: 2015-11-12 06:16:35
Except if everyone does that the price will go no where and no one will keep using bitcoin.  I almost wish bitcoin had a penalty built in for hoarding.
@_date: 2015-11-12 22:31:51
Nice, I like the concept.  I always thought the value store should be separate from the currency.
@_date: 2015-11-21 07:37:34
True but this lets you buy stuff from people who don't take bitcoin.  It probably would work better if they just took a set yearly fee.

It's also inconsequential.  How does running on bitcoin change how anything but how basic transaction fees work?
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:54:37
Who is going to run the mutual fund?  Also I never said nothing will ever replace mutual funds but clearly Bitcoin is not that.
@_date: 2015-11-26 20:03:29
The total lack of understanding of what Bitcoin is and how financial systems work makes me fear that Bitcoin will never achieve what it could because so many of it's advocates are so misinformed.  Hands down Bitcoin is revolutionary but it is not a replacement for the entire financial industry.

The financial industry doesn't run on a specific currency also your shorthand hypothesis has not been my experience talking about Bitcoin in the subreddit.
@_date: 2015-09-05 19:26:49
The OP is just another example of people who don't understand the difference between a currency and a financial system.  It's honestly what makes me doubt Bitcoin will last long term.  No doubt it's a revolutionary idea but it's being championed by a lot of people who fundamentally don't understand what it is.

You don't need to run a whole node, you just need to be able to prove the chain is valid.  If you find out it isn't valid you can start downloading the full chain to double check.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:31:07
lol, you don't have to store to validate, it's literally that simple.
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:19:05
I think you are mistaking trust with blind trust.  But again you can verify the entire chain yourself then run a partial node because you trust the hash.  You just need the bandwidth to run through the whole chain, not to store it.  Everything is a hash, if you trust the hash you trust the chain.
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:11:26


No you aren't, you can tell the chain is fucked with just a hash, you just can't tell why without the whole chain.  That's the entire point of a [Merkle tree]( which is what blockchains are based on.  Now to speed it up you should trust people to a point but as you make your way through the chain you can always work back if someone lies to you.  Just by calculating the hash of every block is simple and then discard it after and move on to the next one, you don't have to store it all to verify the entire thing.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:17:00
You are right, there are so many devs because of the private chains, but that's all infrastructure you need to build a robust public chain.  Also just because it's a private chain doesn't make it mutable, private chains just use other kinds of consensus algorithms other than PoW.
As for how hackable it is, that depends on the programer writing the contract.  I think it's clear it'll be a while before really complex contracts are being run on the public chain however thats a problem you are going to face with smart contracts on any blockchain.  Blockchains don't really have any margin for error so you need to write the code with that in mind.
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:08:22
Circle didn't pivot away, they still use Bitcoin internally I believe.  I'm pretty sure that's how they get the "Best rates. No fees. No, really."  I think they didn't see the point in selling bitcoin and instead focused on using it for cheap money exchanging.

Eagerly awaiting your reply.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:30:13
It gets way more complex than that but basically you never have to have the entire chain at once, you can cycle through it till you find the irregularity.  Although more than likely you would just find another chain that matches what you expected it to be and just ignore the other one.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:08:33


Dude I'm saying you can verify every fucking part of the chain, PERSONALLY, without storing the entire fucking chain at once.  This is a basic function of hashes in programing, it's why Bitcoin was so revolutionary.  If you always require holding the entire chain at once on disk you wouldn't need Merkle trees.  What you area really saying is you want to compute all the hashes personally, which again is TOTALLY FINE.  You still don't have to run a full node, you just need to be able to ask for the full chain of data as needed to run the hashes on so you can verify the data.
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:16:57

I feel like a lot of people lose sight that cryptocurrencies are first and foremost software projects.  Honestly the thing about Ethereum to be worried about from a Bitcoin perspective isn't fees, it's developer adoption.  Ethereum is growing a very large developer community that will likely outpace BTC at some point only because it's a more inviting platform.  If you add fees to that and other market forces it does seem like Ethereum is in a better position right now even though Bitcoin is clearly still the gold star.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:57:55
I don't think you understand how computes work, you only need to load the one block you are hashing into ram.  Once you hash that block you discard it and move on to the next one since every block includes the hash of the previous block.

Federal law requires the FDIC to make payments of insured deposits **"as soon as possible"** upon the failure of an insured institution. While every bank failure is unique, there are standard policies and procedures that the FDIC follows in making deposit insurance payments. It is the FDIC's goal to make deposit insurance payments within **two business day** of the failure of the insured institution.

From what it says there you are earning dividends and not interest.  But there is a similar problem.  If the companies in that fund go belly up you will loose your bitcoins.

If you want to actually get money and start a business you have to have an iphone app first.  Apple first is just the thing you have to do.  It doesn't matter there are more android phones, the perception is all that matters and no one is going to invest in your company with out an iphone app.  Now there might be some exceptions to this rule but there has to be a pretty good reason they did android first or they plan on releasing both at the same time.

A dividend is the company paying you out a share of it's profits because you're a partial owner.
