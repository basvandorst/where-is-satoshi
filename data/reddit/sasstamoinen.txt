WordPress isn't regularly maintained ?

any hosting environment is going to be vunerable if it isn't regularly patched and updated... there's nothing inherently wrong with WordPress...

your OP asks 'Whats the "luckiest" hash ever mined?' 
No hash is luckier than any other hash. All it takes is for the hash to be below the difficulty target for it to be accepted. Some hashes may beat the difficulty target by a much more significant degree, but this doesnt make them any more lucky. 
I think you have just made a poor choice of words when asking your question.

that's not a valid way to define luck.

You should have said that, instead of talking about "luckier" hashes.

In order for this to be true, the rules of the game would need to be that 'the numbers rolled that are closest to 0 win.' In this case, rolling a 1 would be luckier than rolling a 9.
(This isn't how Bitcoin mining works.)
If the rules of the game were simply to 'roll a number less than 10', then in this case rolling a 1 would be just as lucky as rolling a 9. (This is how Bitcoin mining works.)
So your statement is very much dependent on how the rules of the game are defined. If you take the rules as defined by Bitcoin mining, your statement is false.
