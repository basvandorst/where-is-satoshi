1. A market is not sufficiently liquid if one person can singlehandedly cause a near-complete selloff.  Real liquidity means that one rich guy wont be able to move the market, because there will be enough supply/demand around the bid/ask price.  You see this all the time in penny stocks and other low-volume, obscure vehicles.
2. Agreed
3. I had read that the database was executing trades out of timestamp order?  I obviously don't run the site or have access to inside information, but I doubt they have the expertise to implement a trading platform right the first time.
4. I have no idea about Japanese law, but I can easily see someone falling through the cracks at a place like this.  I mean, look, they had to take the site down for days and reset the entire market back the way it was.  You think that if things like that happen enough, there wont be people screwed in one way or another?

This might actually be a healthy thing for the long term adoption of the currency.  Daytrading, get-rich-quick speculators might stay away for a while after seeing how easily the market can be crashed/manipulated.

The "pennies" is on the earnings per share, so beating the EPS by 1 penny when you are AMD means almost 700 million dollars.  I agree with the the GPU business is probably going dandy, but it's a bit disingenuous to come in here and pretend the bitcoin is yet meaningful to AMD's business (not accusing you of that, but others have said similar things round here).

I'm not asking for the difference between Forex and a stock exchange. I am saying the principles that govern the trading of securities and mt gox are quite similar.
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:12:38
Quite frankly, calling somebody an idiot from the get-go is no way to have a discussion.
So please enlighten me, how is the mtgox exchange different from a stock exchange?  They seem very similar to me.

All this amateur stuff that has nothing to do with actual bitcoin security is going to spook the public.  Bitcoin is going to be synonymous with hackers in the public eye. I think it will really slow adoption.

My extremely specific criticism didn't tip you off that I meant be thinking on a higher level about this problem?  I have worked on a project that ran on IBM's world grid.  I know about GPUs and CUDA and all that business.  Scientific computing is what I do.


Gee golly mister, thanks for that eye opener.  The whole point of my comment was that the bitcoin network currently lacks the things that make supercomputers work.  Why do you think clusters have to live on gigabit switches? Why do you think one of the current bottlenecks in supercomputer design is the speed of light considerations in physical proximity?  I'll reiterate:


I'm not saying that the network could never be used to so some kind of embarrassingly parallel image processing, or something of that flavor, but right now (and in the close foreseeable future) it is not a useful computing resource for anything but bitcoin.

Buy low sell high, eh? You and the rest of the world buddy.  Good luck with timing the market.

Hey now, that stock photo ran them $25.  She's clearly mining coins there.

I have a related question to float to you all: why did they standardize the name of the bitcoin wallet?  It really makes it easy for nefarious individuals to look for wallet.dat files by name.  I know that it's unencrypted and anyone with skills could find wallets by file content, but they just made it so easy for the finding.  It's like naming your truecrypt volumes truecrypt.dat and putting them in your "My Truecrypt Files" folder.
@_date: 2011-07-01 13:02:03
I think the bigger hurdle is the buggy client (at least, on OSX/Linux), lack of encryption by default, complicated transaction fee protocol, need to download a blockchain that takes hours via P2P, installer that buries your wallet in the belly of your system files, lack of an easy way to transfer currency for btc, lack of instantaneous feedback on transactions, etc etc.
It's not "going viral" until it is dumbed down so mom and dad can use it, which means there needs to be considerable software/infrastructure investment to hide the layers of complexity from users.  Until then, it's just the computer-literate who have a firm grasp on it.
@_date: 2011-06-29 12:04:01
You are right. I definitely mixed up the math there :)  
@_date: 2011-07-22 11:55:36


Yes, because that's exactly what I said. No exaggeration at all in your comment. Somewhere in there I think I also advocated killing kittens.

It is basically an overkill method to make an already impossible crack even more impossible.  Like all problems in cryptography, the algorithms are not the weakness; the implementation and human aspects are the soft spots.  Nobody is going to break a single-iteration implementation of any modern accepted crypto algorithm (as long as your password is not stupid).
Now, if someone broke SHA-512, bitcoins would be the LEAST of our worries.

Irrelevant. Also, it's "instruments."


Just like stocks.


None of that answered the question about the differences between the two markets.  They are, in fact, very similar.
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:39:43


Protect yourself? By selling in a panic as the market crashes?  If you guys want to flip these things around like day traders, please do yourself a favor and read some cursory investment books.  With all due respect, the kinds of things people say on here are strikingly similar to the behaviors that get people fleeced in the stock market.  Trading by reacting to the market is one of the quickest ways to give up your money.

Sorry for assuming. That makes sense.

I just [ran the numbers](  I'm not saying the stock wont go up or down, but the bitcoin craze probably means pennies to their bottom line.

The could have a 10-fold increase in GPU sales and it would still be a small chunk of their revenue.

That basic math certainly hasn't stopped several people in this subreddit from suggesting ATI stock and even buying it.

It's not about exposing the addresses.   What stops them from remapping your shortened address to whatever they want?
@_date: 2011-06-29 03:00:13
You guys are ridiculous. Do you know how much of AMD's revenue comes from the retail graphics card market?  Do you know how much demand the bitcoin miners create compared to the normal demand for graphics cards?  Just a quick balance sheet estimate I found:


That's about 3% of their 1.57BN quarterly revenue.  It's laughable to theorize any of the above, or to buy the stock on the assumption that bitcoin mining will materially effect the stock price.

There are a million reasons why the flops done by the bitcoin network would not be readily usable for scientific projects.
* Scientific problems are not dummy tasks which can be easily distributed on GPUs which live on different nodes
* There is data to move, dependency between data, and other problems with parallel execution on heterogeneous nodes with different software libraries, OSes, memory, 32 vs 64 bit architecture, etc.
* Unlike a hash function, it is not generally trivial to verify the correctness of scientific work, meaning you will have a 2-4 fold reduction in output because the same problem needs to be solved several times to ensure agreement
* Most scientific programming problems are not amendable to GPU execution
In essence, the bitcoin network is a sprawling, shitty parallel cluster with enormous latency between nodes, no established way to share data (the large kind, not the megabyte-sized text log kind) between nodes, no common set of software libraries and tools to use, and very limited applicability to real science problems.  I wager you are off by an order of magnitude or two when you estimate it's real utility to do anything useful.  All of these GPU mining rigs are essentially dumb dice-rolling machines, throwing spaghetti at the wall rapidly and checking if anything sticks.  It's insane to propose the network (in it's current form) could be used for distributed computing.

Not when there is no liquidity and no stable market maker to execute trades.  What good is day trading if
1. You can't trade because there is too little liquidity
2. The market can drop to 0 almost instantly (there are no halts in place to stop trading if the shit hits the fan)
3. The exchanges are not up to snuff to execute trades properly in times of high volatility
4. There are no laws in place to regulate the markets (i.e. if MtGox screws you out of virtual money by it's own errors, there's nothing you can do)
It's a trader's nightmare out there, not a trader's paradise.  It has nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with the amateurs trying to start a stock market from the ground up.

One "obscures" one's real wallet in a pocket.  I never said it was the only line of defense, just an easy first line to deter script kiddies and amateurs.
