Coinbase is for entry level newbies just getting into crypto.. Once they get thier feet wet and understand more, then gdax is the next level up. Put gdax features on CB and it would most likely scare off newcomers to some degree.

Well golly gee wiz Kreskin... if only I were smart enough to copy and paste a link... oh, wait.. yea, I am and it didn't work... hence the need to ask? And while it may surprise you to know, not everyone is a Cheeto eating computer code nerd and just automatically knows what "rate limit exceeded' means in terms of getting access to a web page...
But thank you for your overwhelming assistance with my query. I am a much better person for your intervention.

but for a vendor to set a price relative to the worth of a good or service with the dramatic value fluctuations going on can't work until there is a way for said products prices to "adjust on the fly" to keep up with BTC's spikes and dips. A gallon of milk for $3.00 this AM vs. $300 at noon vs. $0.76 by dinner...

Gdax.com - coinbase's hotter big sister!

Key words "right now". We all need to be reminded that this is all still very experimental and in its relative infancy...kinda like cavemen finding fire... okay, we've got it... now what all can we do with it!

You just waisted upwards of $6-8 thousand dollars. You REALLY should have done ALL your research first.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:15
Thank you. It wouldn't even load the explanation page when I tried...

Every instruction manual for every tool that I ever bought from Harbor Freight reads just like that...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:54
well, now I'm just triggered....
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:52
So I'm discovering! ��
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:48:19
Ahh... I guess that makes sense...
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:16:50
I got my $10 for referring a friend...
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:40:16

HODLing!!! (and waiting to buy the sell off dip)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:12:03
Either way 10k is a lot to drop on "magical unicorn money" w/o a basic understanding of how to get it/store it/etc...
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:48:27
I wasn't even sure the question made it onto the page...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:43
buy the dip. enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:57:34
I... am your father....
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:27:41
No, not at all... I forget that many people are stupidly wealthy (compared to myself) in this crazy crypto world and 10k to him may be the equivilant of $100 to me.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:51:46
������uhm.... yea, no.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:45
right abut now...!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:14:45
I guess that's true... must be nice.
