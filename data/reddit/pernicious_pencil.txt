Nothing. Nothing is illegal about it at all. 
Someone with money demanded they block these sites, they block first and evade questions later.

We'll be changing ISP of course, but in the meantime a VPN is the plan, as you suggest.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:10:24
Thanks, I shall look into it.
We certainly haven't asked to have the filter on, and we've been with them a while now.

People, read this^
I have no ulterior motive, but you have only my word on that. This happened, but as Gundersen points out *one person has observed this*. As I've already stated a few times, this is just my anecdote, this is not a story.
My belief - again, as already stated - is that there was some foul up, and either the sites were blocked by accident (still not cool, they need to be checking that they don't block perfectly legal sites ) or that it was merely a glitch localised to my account.
Until I hear back, I have no more info to provide. In the meantime, step away from the pitchforks.

Good plan.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:59:42
I agree, im guessing the next I hear from sky will be a long-winded "oops, my bad"
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:51:01
Am now awaiting a call back from a supervisor for an explanation.
This should be entertaining.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:27:23
Way ahead of you, my friend
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:43:19
So far I've had minor trouble with the usual - Torrent sites, websites made by for'n types, etc - This is just ridiculous though.
Im not sure if you can get a list, but you can call customer services and they'll tell you if a site's blocked.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:23:22
I understand what you're saying, its important not to go running for the torches and pitchforks.
However i'd say that it's *their* job to make sure they aren't blocking perfectly legal sites, not mine.

This is in England, in Once-Great Britain
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:14:14
Aye, you may well be right, there.
We'll be changing ISP pretty quicksharp, but in the meantime a decent VPN is looking the way to go
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:25:40
Yes, we had already opted out, I think it was probably briefly switched back on due to some glitch.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:01:45
I asked this myself. 
"We're not saying you're involved in illegal activity. We're just saying these sites have been blocked *to prevent* illegal activity.
OH RIGHT. Makes perfect sense now.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:09:26
I have no explanation for you. 
As for the "story" being BS, this is what happened to me, that's all I've stated.
Im waiting for a call back, perhaps we'll know more soon.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:19:22
They haven't, no.
Frankly I suspect this is a mistake: 
Hey, this website has "bit" in the name, it must be a torrent site! FETCH THE BANHAMMAAAR 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:07:50
That's right, just my anecdote.
I'm not sure what evidence you'd like, as this post is just about what some peon at sky said to me on the phone when I called up to grumble.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:26:24
are you using a proxy or VPN or anything? 
If so, please drop me a pm with the details, i've been trying everything but to no avail, the best i've managed is a semi-loaded page with captchas missing.
