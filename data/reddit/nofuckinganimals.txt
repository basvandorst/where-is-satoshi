Gold.  Also wouldn't be surprised if cash maintained value (few/no people would have the resources to print it).

They just acquihired some really shitty people, there are plenty of other exchanges, so why use them?

Someday Bitcoin will move to proof of stake but the devs understand that when it comes to people's money you want to be very slow and cautious.

If the us government fails we won't have an internet anymore so Bitcoin won't be worth shit

I'm not talking about free speech itself, I'm talking about the term "free speech".  Like, if people called something "anti-fascist money" you'd assume it was left wing even though nobody supports fascists.
And I'm pretty sure I understood the original comment just fine.

Macs encrypt their storage so no.

The point is that the term "free speech" is increasingly associated with the far right.  The implication is that even though "free speech money" might be a good description of bitcoin, it's just going to sound like "right wing money" to most people.
In the long run the term "free speech" will outlast the current political climate but right now I think it's best to avoid it.

M1 money supply is one good comparison, but M2 and gold are also valid choices.  Regardless you get a number in the ballpark of like 5-10 trillion usd

Not saying that the US empire will last forever, just that when empires fall, you get a dark age.  China might be ready to step up and maintain some kind of stability in the world but I wouldn't count on it, and I also wouldn't count on Bitcoin being very useful in that scenario.
None of those governments matter the way that the US does.

It's not just grandmas, it's everybody other than crypto nerds.  Assuming you don't care about the technology or the politics, which most people don't, why would you switch from a system where someone else will cover losses due to malicious activity to a system where you have to take the loss?

For a transaction of this size, you wouldn't be able to instantly buy and then sell the Bitcoin without losing more money than the banking system would have charged you.

The chances of me losing my keys are much higher than the chances of coinbase failing.

There will be services that hold your money for you as long as there is demand for such services.  Most people are never going to manage their own keys simply because they won't want to and thus will be willing to pay somebody else to do it.

Banks cover losses all the time, which they can afford because they perform an extremely valuable economic activity.  If you get rid of fractional reserve banking then you have destroyed this generator of value so there will be less money available to do things like cover people's losses.
Fortunately it doesn't matter what anyone thinks, in the end there will be people offering more or less traditional bank accounts for Bitcoin, and those services will win in the marketplace over holding your own keys because it is a better model.

Hyperinflation is solved by denominating your bank account in bitcoin.  Outrageous fees... aren't an issue that I've experienced but in a world where you don't actually *need* a bank to handle basic payment processing, the banks will have to eliminate customer-unfriendly practices to survive.
In general banks provide a lot a value and I'd bet everything I have that banking will continue to exist in the future.

There is no chance that I wouldn't lose that piece of paper.  Managing your own keys will never be mainstream.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:10:47
People are going to continue to be ignorant, though.  If you want bitcoin to be mainstream, you have to acknowledge that the average person isn't capable of and has no interest in managing their own keys.
Personally, I am confident that I can handle the technical aspects of key management (which I would never expect to be true for more than like 25% of the population) but even so I know that I can't reliably store a physical object (like a hardware or paper wallet) long term without a significant chance of it being lost or destroyed.  If I had enough bitcoin to care, I would store a copy of my keys on paper in a safe deposit box but I would never recommend, to anybody, a solution that doesn't involve a trusted third party (in this case, the bank).

The Bitcoin supply can be changed just like anything else, what "Bitcoin" means is determined by consensus.  It seems impossible for such a consensus to happen today, but imagine a world where Bitcoin is actually mainstream, most of the supply is held by companies like Robinhood or Coinbase on behalf of the regular people who own them, and those people don't know or care about how any of it works...  Then it doesn't sound so crazy.

China might step up and keep the world from collapsing but it's questionable if btc would be useful in this scenario.
