Oh I wasn't even talking about that more of the time it takes for transactions could mess with their bets but they're all gunna have to buy some then they can try to short it but they're all gunna be doing that so that's where I see them having more of a problem but also with that transactions process for the price to go up or down can add to their problem

I wonder if they have a short fail sale safe contract where they sell if they go a certain low amount under or are they losing like 1000s per coin lol let loose the hounds of war lol

So you're telling me that 4-8 day transactions for them to try to short it or if someone else is in-line on the blockchain causes it go up isn't going to give them problems?

That'd be a wild dream come true

I would say it's just more of a fact of who is all listening to this (fans) but subliminally after repetition they'll think about it (or they wont) and that's the only benefit from him mentioning it is the possibility

With how long some transactions take for bitcoin I don't think they'll have much a chance to do their dirty work except adding volume to the network and also money into the whole space I mean it looks like they're doing small increments anyway and I'm guessing they're more working against each other instead of how this community really is so I do hope they wreck themselves by this over analyzing and not knowing much of what really goes on with bitcoin
