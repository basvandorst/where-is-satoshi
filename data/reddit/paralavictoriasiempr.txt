Too bad they have no affiliation to Bitcoin. They could easily pay out users in bitcoin based on the number of ads they get paid.
These guys made a name using bitcoin yet havent given back at all... ( i know bc I reached out and theyve ignored multiple emails..)
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:03:23
The FAQ you are seeing is related to the purchase of bitcoins via wire I think. Dont think it relates to debit card.
I tested making purchases with the debit card and it's usually pretty close to the Bitstamp price.

All bitcoin wallets have to choose between the fine balance of convenience vs. security. It is common practice to setup 2fa, which ALL wallet currently have the option to do.
You say the poor noobs wont know any better.. Who will go through the effort of stealing 5k satoshis?
Assuming that someone doesnt know 2fa is like saying someone will proudly wave around their paper wallet private key. Yea it happens but most people (especially those with any significant btc holdings) will know better.....

@_date: 2014-08-15 19:28:51
From diamondcircle website: "Our Prepaid Bitcoin Debit Cards can be used in online from our website, ATM's and at Merchants all over the World who display the Diamond Circle Logo."
So how many merchants can you use the card at?
If you cant use the card at the places you usually shop it doesnt really solve the pain point here....
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:51:54
@_date: 2014-05-16 22:03:31
How does one go about insuring cold storage for bitcoins when there is no past history to compare it to? This is what gets me thinking that Circle may be claiming to have something they do not have. Maybe that's why it's invite only for now?
 I'd assume the insurance guys would cringe at the thought of pricing something new like that. It would either be too expensive and overpriced (which would likely make the company not want to purchase the insurance) or they would underrate the amount of risk exposure
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:09:06
ANX has horrible fees (load minimums, flat-fee + percentage, costs at the POS). 
Plus why let fiat sit idle on the card if you dont spend what you loaded. Pre-paid cards are a horrible idea.
@_date: 2014-08-14 00:31:28
I dont recall anyone losing money on this. In fact they are paying for the monthly fees, reimbursing users if anything is charged and gave $25 to users that were blocked. How is that bait and switch?
@_date: 2014-07-15 01:38:30
Doesnt look like they have chat support but they got back to me pretty quickly. Emailed them on a Saturday night regarding a Vault transfer and they answered in less than an hour that it can take up to 24hrs at times.
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:24:36
Sounds like they are dependent on their card partner for these fees. They may be negotiating to not have the fee charged but IF it does get charged they will reimburse us.
At least how I interpreted it. I would doubt they would risk having fees reimbursed for some users but not others after this PR shit storm
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:06:36
For someone sending bitcoins to their families across the world and having them be able to pull out cash from an ATM... that is a pretty powerful thing IMHO
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:29:32
Looks like you may be one of the lucky few that had the card created and shipped before the US crack down. I wish I could say the same :(

Anyone know how bitcoin debit vs. prepaid card fees compare? Everyone mentions Cryptex but I havent been able to find any information about their fee structure. ANX has this info, Xapo is yet to come out wit theirs

When a bitcoin company says they make their money "on the float" what does that mean?
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:44:06
*This is not a debit card. This is a prepaid card!*
Prepaid card: You must SELL your bitcoins to load your card with fiat in order to spend. (This is why there is a 'loading' fee)
Debit card: You SELL your bitcoins at the POS and it's automatically withdrawn from your bitcoin wallet.

Xapo is led by Wences Casares who has been spreading the good Bitcoin gospel to Wall Street and the financial world. He has the track record of building fintech companies for many years so is well respected among these big hitters. He is helping the ecosystem move away from sketch balls like Shrem, Ver, Karpeles, etc... A good thing IMHO.

I would avoid any wallet that is based in the US. By using a service based in the US your wallet provider has to abide to all compliance laws in the US. This would envelope over you, your viewers and performers.. Coinbase has been known to shut down accounts tied to sketchy use cases. It would suck for one of your performers to work her ass off and then not be able to withdraw her funds for some reason.. prob not the best way to get started.
I would also avoid any desktop wallet (high risk) and hardware wallets (too complex for the average user).
I would probably go with an international service. My suggestion would be to have them create a Bitstamp account (so that they can sell their btc too) or go with Xapo (based in Switz). With Xapo your performers can also get a debit card they can spend their btc with.
@_date: 2015-09-22 15:28:13
COuld it be their investors pressuring them to do this to cover their asses? Then if Coinbase goes belly up they have some IP to sell to at least keep some $$$? Thoughts?

@_date: 2015-04-21 21:29:51
Youre missing the point here. Who cares if it's 75MM, 150MM or 10MM. It's still an order of magnitude larger than the ENTIRE bitcoin ecosystem we have today! And it's using bitcoins as the economy itself as opposed to letting people buy taringa points for bitcoins which get immediately converted to fiat.
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:02:20
Yes it is. I'm OK with that.
@_date: 2015-09-21 04:14:07
I think you're right but the Xapo card doesnt need loading. It converts the btc into fiat on the spot when you make a purchase.
The (lack of) branding may be because Visa/MC has them by the balls on what they can and cant do with printing on the card and promoting it.
@_date: 2015-09-08 20:50:45
I'm not 100% sure. I think you have to add some ID info but I dont remember sending them a copy of documents. 
I'm working on adding them to a mobile game. The thing I like is that your users can create bitcoin wallets just by using email. That takes out sending the user to create a wallet somewhere else, copy-pasting it on the app, etc..
@_date: 2015-09-04 23:29:42

@_date: 2015-11-05 17:23:29
That doesnt make sense. They charge a fee in bitcoin... so the higher the btc price the more fiat they get for you using the card....
A price increase would be a great time for them to cash out those coins.

We are at the end of 2015 and Bitcoin is still seen as a criminal tool... people still referring to Silk Road and Mt. Gox. That has to change. The way I see it is either we start some communication with agencies that will bring credibility to bitcoin as a currency and means of transaction or the industry will die.
The Blockchain Alliance is a way to start the dialogue and feed education about bitcoin's positive uses to these federal agencies instead of sending them to read a 40 page document or research btc on their own.
I see this as a good. Sorry you werent included in the discussion Bruce (you sound a bit butthurt by it).

I dont think they will do anything to help with PR. But an open dialogue to answer questions or clarify the technology's use will definitely help.

It's mid-2016 and Reddit is still pushing this "paper wallet stored in your basement is best. own the private keys, own the bitcoins".
To me that's the real facepalm. Our industry will never move forward or make its way into the mainstream if everyone needs to be as paranoid and hardcore as the users in this forum. 
There are a few players that have established some credibility and trust IMHO. I leave all my bitcoins with them and sleep well at night.
@_date: 2015-10-18 02:50:40
So I found bitcoin listed under the G2A Pay options. Although not sure if that affects anything. If I were them I'd make bitcoin an option next to Paypal, Skrill, etc... but that's just me. Most users wouldnt pick G2A Pay if Credit/Debit card is an option before that.
