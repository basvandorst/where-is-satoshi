I am not sure if this place will work for canadians, but its worth a try
Also I haven't tried this place out yet, so its at your own risk.
@_date: 2016-03-27 21:35:03
 maybe?
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:39:08
just cops afraid that they will miss out on a dime that they could 'confiscate' as 'contraband'.

This is just a bunch of leftist ranting.  Basically, it's like listening to a brainwashed former P.O.W. war vet babbling about battle plans that have been outdated for the last 30 years.  
Coming from your lips, 'Capitalism' is just a bad word used to smear people who engage in voluntary trade with each other or with 'merchants', because you 'progressives' are hysterical with worry that someone might actually escape your micromanaged 'utopia' and actually think for themselves.

Hey, just calling it like I see it.

I know, geeze.  For people who judge others like you all are doing, you sure aren't very smart yourselves.
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:27:29
The fact that you have taken up the latest media buzzwords like 'alt right' and 'fake news' is sufficient proof that you are a 'useful idiot' of the lowest order.  You are just one of a million unfortunate, brainwashed souls tainted with the sickness of leftism.  To the dustbin of history with you!

Well, I blame it on the subpar education that you obviously received, along with possibly poor nutrition.  And I would add that parental neglect was most likely involved, as shown by the lack of imagination and initiative in your responses.  With some time, and lots of therapy, you might even be able to live a relatively normal life.

I hate to throw out a suggestion without having tried them first, but try this place:

damnit, I guess that may not work with a regular credit card.

I have stuff I want to use bitcoin for, and it's just such a pain in the ass, I probably won't even bother.  I mean, I am not even lazy with computers, so it's not me.  Stuff like, I stopped carrying a cell phone, so I don't have minutes on it.  Now I can't log into circle.  They won't take my card, my bank account is rejected, etc. etc.  it just has lots of moving parts and it's a pain in the ass.  (not all of these things have happened to me, they are just examples, btw)

The closest libertyx to me is literally 30 miles away, the next closest is 50.  there is a bitcoin ATM 60 miles from me.  If I had the capital, I would do this in a second.  Can't wait to read some of the replies to this thread.

Here, if the police even thought that you sold three palm trees and one marijuana tree, they would swoop in and take the whole 400 bucks and say it was the proceeds of crime.  They have no problem or qualms about using 'dirty' money.
So, I guess that's one way of looking at it.

Well, all that is fine for our western governments, because then they get to dress up in their riot gear and their jackboots and drive their badass armored vehicles, toting their automatic rifles and full ceramic body armor.
They WANT us to try to fuck with them, so they can smash our faces.  They WANT us to yell out your window, 'I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore' so that we get it all out of our systems.  Makes people feel like they accomplished something.  They WANT us to try to join a militia or donate to Al Qaeda or start a clandestine local cell, so that they can play hero and eliminate the threat; if not outright killing us, locking us away in a supermax hellhole for life.  They WANT us to be ripe for recruitment so that we can join the fake terrorist organizations that they have created in order to entrap and entice us into joining so that they have any excuse to come down hard on us, after all, terrorists are lower than dirt and deserve to be killed, ask anyone on the street.
Ask a typical college student.  They will tell you that terrorists are traitors and deserve to die, and also that Malcom X signed the Declaration of Independence, and that global warming killed off all the penguins.

The average American citizen would not even be able to comprehend the vast scope of the rackets that the PTB run.  Basically our entire society is just one big carnival midway, and we are the suckers stumbling along with our cotton candy in one sticky fist and a corn dog in the other.

I think it's great that society has finally found a way to easily identify the idiots among us.

What do 'the yanks' have to do with anything?  This happened in Europe, where the firearms that frighten you so much are mostly banned.
