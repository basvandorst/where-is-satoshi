You might be interested to know that you can apply for a non habitual resident status that exempts you of taxes on income that comes from abroad, for 10 years.
They did that to give incentive for capital to come over and it works. The E.U is not happy about it for obvious reasons, but somehow the law is still in effect.
Edit: a word.

Well the income has to come from abroad, so it can't come from a Portuguese company.

If only a tv show could take that plot and tell that story it could do a big bang...

While I dont think an 80% drop would be completely impossible, I respectfully disagree. I estimated a correction from 12.5-13.0 to 8.5-9.0 at most (when considering the last two dips). But I wouldn't swear by it because the new flow of investors might actually disrupt this trend and either slow down the correction or even counter the momentum completely. 
We'll really see whatsup THIS Sunday probably. Traders will probably drive the price down to cash out because most of them bought around 6-6.5 during the last dip and try to buy low again. And there we'll see if they overshot and missed the market or if they keep sertting the tone.
