Yes.  Can crypto economies evolve fast enough to provide a platform for fiat independence by then?
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:23:20
Yes, absolutely.
I stopped mid signup and didn't look back.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:46:18
That doesn't mean it shouldn't be considered and discussed.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:41:38
Agreed.  I believe we're about to enter an evolutionary transition in human history.  That's why I think the discussion needs to begin on how best to navigate.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:56:57
Every time Conservatives have initiated massive unbalanced tax cuts like they did this year, it leads to economic recession within 1-1/2 to 2 years. That would be mid to late 2019. 
So by your reasoning, you believe Crypto in general will be perceived as stronger due to its decentralized nature when compared to central banking shenanigans?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:03:42
Thank you for this.  That is a useful website!
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:45:33
LOL.  Flagged for removal because it discusses BTC's reaction to recession in the traditional markets even though pertains to general trading or **market discussion**.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:09:57
Seems to be a recurring theme.

Keep holding your breath.  Let me know how it goes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:12:03
Right?  I'm seriously questioning how manipulated this game really is.  
Unless there's is some mathematical explanation that some have figured out.  Fibonacci doesn't explain everything.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:07:55
They're $1k below their GDAX Trade Open
They're down -21% over the past 24 Hours and dropping 
They've barely moved since the initial Pump and are starting to dump.
BTC on the other hand has survived the Pump n Dump and remained flat over the past 24 hours with some exchanges showing positive growth and an upward trend over the past 6 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:45:15
This, but you gotta admit it takes balls to make some of those calls.

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:42:15
Yup.  I've moved on.  It's obvious it's being heavily manipulated.

@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:42
Touched 12.1k and now back to 13k in 5 minutes. Wow.  Wish I had whale bankroll right now.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:02:01
Alright, so when the sub routine compounds the interest it uses all these extra decimal places that just get rounded off. So we simplified the whole thing, we rounded them all down, and drop the remainder into an account we opened.
It's very complicated. It's uh it's aggregate, so I'm talking about fractions of a Bitcoin here. And over time they add up to a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:23:09
I would put on your investigative journalist hat and take a good close look at Mr. Bitcoin Jesus and his recent collusion with GDAX and their market manipulation.  
This type of garbage needs weeded out ASAP for Crypto's to remain/gain credibility.
The past 4 days have put a tarnish on ALL cryptos.  This correction is evidence of that.
As for me, I have faith that we will see a rebound, although I doubt it will be as rapid as many in here would like to believe.  I'd be thrilled with something remotely resembling steady, solid growth towards 20k by July 18.  But that won't happen, the roller coaster ride will continue as it has since BTC's inception.  I Hold BTC and several other cryptos (Including DOGE at the behest of my daughter... LOL) and I continue to hold and add to the portfolio.
The volatility degrades BTC-as-Currency arguments.  And I would wager a good chunk of my holdings that manipulation is playing a big hand in that volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:53:53
So that would indicate that $200 or so is the support floor?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:09:20
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:26:22
Take that bet - Make it one BTC to the winner.

No.  What's your other option?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:51:39
I saw a downward trend at 14.5k and thought no way.  Bought more.  Sonofabitch! Trust the instincts damnit.

More interestingly, right now seems to be a slow-motion replay of the afternoon/evening.
Bcash jumped up almost 500 points in 2 hours.
BTC Dropped about 800 or so
ETH and LTC seem to be following suit.
*EDIT* Now trends have inverted.  Activity seems to be very closely intertwined.

Currently about a 4,300BTC wall  and 6,800BTC wall 
I'd be shocked if we made it all the way down to 10k before the whales smelled the blood in the water and absolutely trounced on it.

Somebody has to prop up the Pump before the dump...

You didn't lose anything.  You never realized your gain.  
Understand the difference.
Your best bet right now.  Do not look at the price for another 15 to 20 days.  You'll be singing a different tune.
Whatever you do, don't sell now, you're still up.  
Zoom Out.

Seeing the sales volume and value drop in BTC with the relative static movement in Bcash despite similar volume, yeah, there appears to be some propping.  
When they get tired of that, there will be a flood back to BTC.  Buy the dip for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:16
Or not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:00:12
You can't think like that.  If you don't have the balls to make the call at the top, you can't complain when you realize your gains at a lower value.
Take your Life Savings and put it back where it came from since it's a retarded ass idea to dump in any money you can't afford to lose completely.  Then take the 75k in "Free Money", buy at the bottom, and forget about it for the next 2 or 3 years (while keeping an ear on BTC's general direction).

So that price point has to have endurance.
Then looking at BTC's price over time, I'm not seeing a particular price that would qualify as a "support" price yet.  It looks like there are dips, then increases, then dips - but not all the way down to the previous dip.
The price seems to be ratcheting upwards.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:43:16
agreed.  But the upward trend looks like it has begun.  Up 2K from 3 hours ago.
