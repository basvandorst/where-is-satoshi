Bitcoin can very well be used to buy things its just are you willing to pay the fees for using bit to purchase that item? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:09:19
So clearly you just told him to throw money into something that WILL make you money. If you have to explain to him now after he lost a nice chunk of money then you didnt do it to good in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:36:27
Again it sounds like youre not comfortable with the crypto/currency space your currently involved in. If you dont like the transaction rates then fix it yourself or dont put your money into something you cant wrap your head around when it drops like this 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:23:28
So he should know that bitcoin does this  like crazy and you have no need to be embarrassed. Been holding for just as long and ive seen this happen a handful of times 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:58:50
I like the Alec Monopoly style he's got going there. Very nice piece of work 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:29:54
Then you clearly dont like where your money is invested and i think you should get out as quickly as possible if you cant fathom 20-50% drops in a two day period 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:55:55
Well litecoin or eth are way better options for acquiring alts then btc at the moment unless you conviently have your btc already on an exchange. I dont think he should keep them on exchanges but understand this stuff isnt free to move around either and btc has never been cheap to send atleast at this stage in the game

Its called competition my man and the blockchain is waiting for the right applicants to make there way succesfully on it. Just cause bits the first dosent mean its the last too 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:42:24
So why are you replying to this thread on a cryptocurrency subreddit that has been known time and time again to drop 20-50% in a few day span? Im not trying to be a dick i just dont get the point youre trying to make. I feel the same way you do but guess what? Not 100% of my total porfolio is in bitcoin or even 50% of it at that so when stuff like this happens im not bugging that my one coin is down 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:17:40
Or just buy ltc to begin with. Thats something you could of advised too
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:07:51
Its clear what bitcoin was intended for but what occured was too much in too little of time. No duh bits supposed to be used as a way on confirming transactions but the massive influx of people that came into it overloaded a system that wasnt meant to be dealing with this much traffic....yet. Thus causing high fees and long transaction times 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:30:18
Ok ill do my homework then get back to you
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:01:13
Dont tell me, tell your boss 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:21:32
You act like a few snaps of the finger and the problems fixed. Sorry just think its a stupid question in this thread. Need more technological posts on bitcoin rather than kids complaining how there losing money in a market they were brought to by just numbers going up
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:00:58
Youre asking questions that i deal with too man. I got into bit early this year and made a couple bucks on it. I hold bitcoin and only do as minimal transactions on it as possible because i UNDERSTAND there are high fees and transfer times. If its worth it for me to transfer btc to another alt i will, i take the hit on that. But i dont make habit of moving my btc every day
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:34:05
Theres plenty of things you can buy with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:19:07
And hopefully with Lighting we get a fix to this and your boss dosent need to worry about 2 day wait times and you can feel not embarrassed about  whatever advice you gave to your boss 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:19:19
The main thing i tell people is understand the risk youre getting yourself into. Seeing the numbers generated is appealing and people want to be apart of it while its hot. Also, If youre going to invest your own money into something atleast have some basic knowledge on the subject.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:14:06
Again man, clearly you havent been keeping up to date. 2 days yeah its ridiculous but it happens. Tell him to buy ripple or lite if hes looking for crazy quick transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:04:31
You dont hold any obligation to explain to someone why they are losing money on an investment they made. Clearly you didnt inform him enough on how this whole get rich quick thing works. Embarrassing on your part 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:50:59
Think about hundreds of thousands of transactions where they will pay this fee, they are a business and this simply dosent fit into them making sufficient profit on there games if they are paying these high fees
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:19:18
Now he gets 10%
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:15:24
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:21:50
Im pretty sure we can use are heads and conclude what the main focal point is ;)
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:17:55
I chargin up now 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:44:11
WE need more posts like this. Its clear and to the point. Everyone has their reasons for selling their crypto and i think you did the right thing and you shouldnt even look back on it. Youve been through it and you know where its headed. Focus on the world outside of crypto for a moment and when your ready to get back into it you know itll be here for you. Good luck with everything and I hope you can confidently say you enjoyed the ride.

Im just feeling big things the next few weeks is all. Ive been devoting a little time into crypto and in the past few months (i started in June) ive seen so much happen. If we keep seeing this constant succession like it has been since Ive started there is a very successful future in blockchain and crypto
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:10:21
I bought some bit and etherum at the same time around June. When I saw a nice drop in the prices the next few days after I just purchased them it  discouraged me in a sense. But now here we are just 2 months later and I can say I'm feeling a lot better about my decisions, sure I could of bought both a little cheaper but moving forward I'm happy I got in when I did. It's given me a interest in crypto and blockchain technology is something I hope to learn to understand one day. Whether you look at crypto for the investing aspect or the technology, it's definitely something revolutionary.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:06:40
Absolutely, get in on the ground floor now and grow with this technology as it advances. Blockchain itself is where i want to spend a good majority of my time focusing on.
