Make a BIP38 encrypted private key and put it in the cloud, or copy the key to several locations, so you won't lose it. Store the password securely and separately from the BIP38 encrypted key of course.
That kind of cryptography is very hard to brute force since the decryption algorithm is very intensive to compute, so you can still have a reasonably memorable password, but not too short of course.
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:11:36
I didn't mean to imply you'd have any reason to do that now, but it really looks to me like those other developers might have been approached and told to desist, hence my asking about your dev team being at least partly anonymous, like Monero's, last I checked anyway.

@_date: 2015-06-26 14:29:35
I agree with you. It is just that I am not technical enough to judge whether there is the actual need for a limit at a certain point. 
So if we can deal with spammig transactions outside the protocol that is all the better; if we can't, moving limits based on recent block size and fees might be an acceptable compromise, after all a moving limit like Monero's for intance doesn't impose a limit on the long run growth of the network.

They might be referring to dolar volume. Bitcoin certainly is nowhere close in number of transactions, and it will never be if Core devs and Chinese miners have their way... People need to wake up and start using clients that allow for exponential growth, like Bitcoin Unlimited and XT.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:59:57
Doesn't that sound great? I mean, that is really what we want: miners incentivized to increase the number of transactions in the network.
Notice that by increasing the utility of the network, the miner that mined the big block increases the value of the of all bitcoins, including the ones mined by the small or possibly empty block, so that is a win-win.
@_date: 2015-06-18 03:13:18
BIP 100 gives miners control over the block size limit imposed on *everyone*, whereas this proposal only allows them to limit the size of *their own* blocks.
BIP 100 would allow miners to more easily collude to make block space more scarce, and hence transaction fees artificially higher. With this proposal, they are forced to compete for efficiently filling the blocks within the hard limit which they, crucially, do not control.
That is what I understood, anyway. I am not sure what the soft fork that Gavin refers to would do and how would it affect long term scalability though.
Edit: fixing typos.
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:48:49
By the time I wrote the post I had just gotten 1 confirmation, but it did take 5 or six blocks to get included. The fee was 100 bits, and I said it was high priority because that was what blockchain.info said in the transaction page.

Does voting with a full node count fir anything? From what I understood, XT will only become active (the block size hard fork anyway) once it has mining majority, and since the Chinese miners have already declared that they will not support it, won't that plan be dead in the water?
IMHO, that illustrates that it is a bad idea to give miners that power. Bitcoin should be about its end users and utility, not about big miners' welfare.
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:22:31
That is a good point, thanks.
Although I still wonder why people would get into such an arrangement. The picture I have in my mind is that people originally wanted to keep their money safe (perhaps gold, way back) and would give it to the bank to secure it, not to lend it out, but the bank would do it anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:24:32
Well, if the supply is in fact "tiny" for over the counter markets, then those markets should experiment "higher" prices than off the counter markets.
If that is indeed true that these "whales" are dumping coins to bring the price down at over the counter markets, we should thank them for their selflessness and buy as much as we can, for as long as we can!
Consistent price differences between markets are usually a result of financial and fiscal barriers of their corresponding legacy system and jurisdiction. Anything else should be unsustainable or fruit of conspiracy theories, IMO.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:10:43
Yeah, I've come to the same conclusion, even for brick and mortar stores: just ask them if you can pay using btc, don't try to convince them to change the way they do business. Baby steps!
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:27:04
If there is no cap, they can still *produce* 1 MB blocks, but still have to verify and relay bigger blocks. So if say 30% of the hashing power wants 1 MB blocks, 30% of the blocks will have at most that size, but the rest are free to be much bigger.
If, on the other hand, we depend on a vote to change the cap, then everybody might have to be stuck with 1 MB, even though 70% of the hashing power could have processed many more transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:23:39
Why not already set up a curve to automatically increase the 32 MB block size cap? How about having that limit double say every couple of years (however many blocks correspond to that), and then if on the way up someone try to actually perform a spamming attack, or other issues are found, putting a hard cap back on shouldn't be as hard as getting rid of it, right?
This discussion is consuming everyone and it would be great to avoid having to go over it again in the future, when things will be much harder to change. It really feels like what is implicit here is "well, by then we'll have the Lightening Network, or something like it, so that we never have to rise that limit again"... 
@_date: 2015-06-13 00:18:46
Doesn't this mean that in this setting people like those miners in China who were against the block cap increase because they don't have enough bandwidth will have the power to hold the network down to 1 MB or some other crippling limit?
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:08:51
From what I heard, the problem with big blocks is that some miner could put out a 100 MB block and that would cause miners with lower bandwidth to spend most of their time downloading and verifying this block instead of mining on top of it.
Here is what I don't understand:
I believe one only needs the block header to start mining on top of the old one, so these miners could start mining for the next block (possibly an empty one) even if they haven't already checked its content.
Eventually this miner will finish checking the big block, and there are two possibilities: (a) the big block was valid all along, in which case we are all happy; or (b) the big block was invalid, and so is now the empty one mined on top of it, in which case *both* miners lose their rewards, so there is no incentive to put out an invalid block in the first place.
So what is the problem with big blocks?
@_date: 2015-06-28 13:25:40
Unfortunately, you are absolutely right.
@_date: 2015-06-13 00:35:56
People are rent-seeking animals, miners included. So when you see that huge miners in China don't support the block size increase because they don't have enough bandwidth, if they have the political power, than they are wrecking the network by keeping it small.
I think it is important to keep our eyes in the goal of Bitcoin, which is to become the first world's electronic cash, that means we keep pushing for greater network capacity, not for miner's welfare.
@_date: 2015-06-14 14:55:25
How does one actually use that? Is there a website or client?
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:53:02
So now states wanting to fight or slow down Bitcoin adoption have a new alternative: drug legalization. That would be a nice side effect of this whole experiment.
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:38:51
But if there is fractional reserve banking being done with btc, won't these banks run into the same kind of trouble that the current ones are, and won't people want to hold on to actual btc after they experience a few fractional reserve bank runs?
I think that is what they would have done  with their fiat already, were there a practical and safe way of storing it elsewhere.
Is there any fundamental reason to believe that a fractional reserve will evolve with btc?

I am so relieved to hear this! Just to be sure: you mean that happens *automatically* every two years, with no need of further hard forks, right? That would be amazing!
Edit: Actually, what happens if adoption and miners' capacity grow faster than that? We might need a new hard fork then. It sounds super optimistic now, but adoption at least comes in big waves sometimes...
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:07:02

@_date: 2015-06-08 23:19:28
On a scale that only governments have been able to pull off historically.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:21:20
That is not necessarily bad. In fact, it seems that right now it would be great to have a little more bandwidth rather than continuing to add to the security of a system that might never scale.
Also, how exactly would this make the system less secure? After all, even the high bandwidth miners are (and will be for the foreseeable future) fighting to get the block rewards more than the fees, and that would possibly be even more true if the block size increase and fees drop as a result.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:49:49
I don't understand why Mike and Gavin are talking only about a single 20 MB increase, instead of some hard coded schedule for increasing the cap every so many blocks, kind of like the difficulty adjustments. Any ideia why that is?
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:55:27
Why are they pushing for a single 20 MB increase, and not some scheduled cap increase, like what we see with the reward halvings?
@_date: 2015-06-21 14:52:59
And those are the people pushing to have block size limits so that they can still take advantage of subsidized cheap energy?
I don't get this community. We would rather have more decentralized mining, but at the same time we are willing to tie down the whole network with these cripling limits so that these same big miners can have their way. Makes no sense to me... I remember the good old days when Gavin just used to say "I don't care about the miners". We have come a long way from that now.
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:39:00
Two-hour wait! It is starting to happen...
@_date: 2015-06-22 03:52:58
Right, that is my point: remove the limit completely for the time being, and hopefully we don't have to have this discussion ever again, but if we do putting a cap is much easier than removing one... 
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:32:26
Fees should evolve anyway just because miners have to spend resources verifying transactions and broadcasting bigger blocks, that is even if the limit is 1 GB, miners will try to impose a lower soft limit to what they can process without risking orphaning their blocks too much and maximizing fees of the transactions that they include. Even today, many blocks are very small, compared to the 1 MB cap.
The point of having a fixed schedule to increase the cap would be precisely to avoid kicking the can down the road. Having that schedule of, say, double the cap every couple of years (or the close equivalent in number of blocks) seems better than having a hard fork every couple of years just to maintain a spam prevention feature.
@_date: 2015-06-13 00:09:03

Yeah, and I could be way off on this one, but wasn't that more like some fraudulent scheme that people learned to tolerate, partly because it was supported by the state? I have the impression that if people were to try to lend what they don't have, and which belonged to others, in any other context than banking, that would be considered illegal in most jurisdictions in most times, and for obvious reasons.

@_date: 2015-06-30 00:09:23
That is kind of an interesting feature. Maybe it could be used to produce some mixing and partitioning of your own funds that would increase privacy by making your transactions look like coinjoin transactions. Better yet would be having real coinjoin transactions regularly happening on the background. 
Privacy and fungibily are fundamental problems with Bitcoin which really need to be solved soon.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:46:46
You can find a very good explanation of how it works, with illustrations here  
It is really easy to understand. I suppose all is needed is a parallel network for peers to communicate, form and sign the coinjoin transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:40:15
In that post he says that those services are necessary because of the 10-minute between blocks might be too long for some applications, not because the network couldn't handle the number of transactions. (Although this might be mitigated by nodes reporting double spend attempts, I believe.)
Layer 2 is a good thing of course, but why put unnecessary and arbitrary bounds on Bitcoin? I think pretty much everybody agrees that it is easier do something to remedy a real threat of spamming attack, rather than increase the limit if it is reached again, so why not go for unlimited block size, perhaps with a soft moving limit, like Monero for intance, that would allow time for the network to respond should such a problem arise?
Why not let the layer 2 come about naturally, driven by demands other than *artificial* scarcity of block space (as opposed to natural scarcity from processing capacity, bandwidth, fees etc)? I mean, if there is no limit, don't we get layer 2 anyway?
But the main thing I don't understand is why are the developers giving so much importance the constrains of some miners, or any miners at all for what is worth. Sure, they might not be able to handle some big blocks (in the unlikely event that we actually start seeing greater usage), but then shouldn't it be up to them to relocate to areas with better internet connection, and wouldn't this be a good thing for Bitcoin? After all, people have been complaining about the growing centralization of mining, which happens because of precisely these miners who are now asking for their restriction hold back the whole network.
Why are we letting these miners have so much influence over the block size? (That is what my Gavin quote was supposed to illustrate.) Isn't the original vision that utility of the network should be the source of value of Bitcoin, which would then make miners want to mine it, in a positive feedback of utility and security? It is true that if the Chinese miners drop we would have a drop in difficulty and hence in security, but wouldn't you agree that that would be a temporary thing until mining gets reallocated?
I know you are on the other side of this argument, and that you are probably tired of this discussion, but since your opinion counts a lot,
it would be great if you could answer these questions.
Edit: fixing typos.
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:52:04
I keep wondering how we arrived at this mess. Does anyone know why did Gavin stepped down to begin with? He was doing a great job, so I don't see why anyone (including himself) would have wanted him to leave his position as lead developer...

@_date: 2015-06-26 15:19:20

B2B transactions in Bitcoin, finally.
@_date: 2015-06-21 20:32:32
Yeah. Basically we are not fixing Bitcoin now because Chinese miners want to remain confortably making their money, without working too hard to increase the utility of the network; and because some devs who don't share Bitcoins original view want to have an edge for trying their pet solutions a few years diwn the road.
Gavin used to say he didn't care about miners, so why these two groups are having so much influence now, and in such a clearly detrimental way to Bitcoin, is beyond me. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 02:58:17

Thanks for the detailed analysis, but you are basing it on *current* numbers and technology.

If we don't let Bitcoin scale by design, we are just making your prediction into a self fulfilling prophecy.

Sure, the transaction costs are not bared by the people doing the transactions, but by the people who hold btc. Those costs are enormous as pointed out by the OP, and everybody who holds btc should want there to be more transactions per block to decrease that cost (and at the same time, and much more importantly for them, increasing the utility of the btc network and hence the value of its tokens).
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:55:36
32 MB even is a low hard limit in the long run. A hard fork now is already very complicated; it will only get more complicated by the time 32 MB starts being a cripling limit to Bitcoin.
It is okay to have a hard limit, as long as it increases *automatically* over time. Bitcoin's original vision is of a world currency, so we should aim to have enough space to onboard everybody in the long run.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:28:02
And people to engage the public and surrounding stores too.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:24:23
These fixed limits may end up being too much or too little, depending on adoption and network capacity over time. We need moving limits that get feedback from the network activity and would allow Bitcoin to grow as much as it needs to and become the first world's cash system, as it was always intended to be.
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:03:44
I have that question myself. But when we consider all dollars that could be used to buy btc, or that correspond to the total sum of goods and services available, don't we have to take those usd in bank accounts, as opposed to just the physical bills in circulation?

Why stop in 20 years? And why start at 8 MB, if the network can take 20? I know the Chinese want that, but why do we care at all?

Thay sounds about right.
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:27:26
I agree with you, I don't understand why people think 8 MB would be too much. In fact, I am much more worried that 8 GB will be too little, given the pace we've seen technology evolve. I wonder why people are not showing more concern over the fact that we are going to face this same problem 20 years down the road, with much greater consequences.

Yeah, I see something like that happening too, but I don't know much about Lightcoin, except that it is supposed to be a clone of btc with faster processing time (2.5 min?) and scrypt mining algorithm. From what you are suggesting, there is no block size limit, or a bigger limit? Could you please summarize the main differences, both technical and political?
I have been thinking a lot about getting into Monero because I always felt that the biggest problem woth btc was the lack of privacy and therefore fungibility, which they solve very nicely. Also, Monero has no hard limit, just a soft moving one. It bothers me a little that they will emit money forever, but it is a fixed minimum reward per block, which means always positive-but-approaching-zero rate.of inflation. I don't know much more about the technical specifications. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:00:12
How the heck are people supposed to know whether a certain product is organic from the blockchain beats me.
Also kind of ironic the use case of blockchain to break the fungibility of diamonds.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:47:18
If I read this correctly, it says *for 20 years*, that is just 10 more doublings... that means we'd have to wait that long to still have a maximum, not average, of ~~7000  transactions per second~~ (ops, that is actually 57344 tps, but the main point remains). That is still too few! 
Can't we have doublings every 1.5 years, following Moore's law, and have that indefinitely?
After all, this spamming attack has always been just a theoretical possibility, and we would be much better served if prevention was taken care of at the miners level, not the protocol. Ideally, there would be no hard limit.
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:56:06

That has got to be the lamest explanation I've ever seen, for something of this importance.
It is pretty clear that in the future miners will make most of their revenue through fees, and this is nothing but good old fashioned lobbying to keep the fee prices artificially high. I am very disappointed to see we giving up to that kind of pressure.
@_date: 2015-06-13 01:05:20
*Cheap* security.
If it is super secure, but the block size cap is low, then only a few people or institutions will be able to use it, and will pay very dearly for it. 
The more people use Bitcoin, the higher its value is, the more it attracts miners, the more secure it gets, not the other ways around.
I think handling power over the size of the network to the people that are working to run it it tantamount to handling strategic decision making in a company to the worker's union; it will lead to stagnation, and to Bitcoin losing its prominent position.

I thought I was running a full node, but have only 8 connection with my bitcoind, so I guess at least currently I am not voting either way, but I will be glad to run an XT asap.
You say there is no patch yet. What does that mean in practical terms?
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:32:46
The first thing that comes to mind is using Local Bitcoins, or finding the nearest Bitcoin ATM.
I guess you could also ask a friend who has a Circle or Coinbase account to buy it for you, although I am not sure of the legality of that. If it is under 100 usd per week, the purchase is instantaneous (with Circle, at least).

How invasive is it to use that one? Palm scan, id etc?
@_date: 2015-06-22 03:50:33
I agree it is desirable that a common person be would be able to run a full node, but it would also be okay to have just enough full nodes to go around, even if it is a bit expensive. Decentralization should not be about "everyone" being able to run a full node, but just about not being able to prevent new nodes from joining in.
All these caps seem way too much right now, but tech growth keeps surprising us, and 8 GB may well be the 1 MB 20 years from now. It is much easier to put a cap on the system than it is to remove one, as we are seeing. No cap should be the conservative approach for that reason.

I heard this before, that each application in Android runs into its own virtual machine. Does that mean that we don't have to worry about key loggers? What about the carriers and phone manufacturers, can't they get access to the files in one's cell phone, and perhaps log what they see and do? 
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:44:20
I agree. My original post was poorly worded in that it invited the discussion of the legal definitions, whereas I just wanted to point out the fact that the legal system seems to have incorporated the notion that it is ok for you to defend your own life and liberty with lethal force if necessary, as long as the cause of that situation is not related to breaking some law, however victimless that crime may be (I am thinking facilitating the online sales of drugs).
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:53:45
I am not sure I follow.
In the first case, the price was higher than the highest bid and lower than the lowest ask; and same is true in the second case, right?
When we look at the price, all we are seeing is a sequence of numbers over time, so shouldn't it really matter only what the previous price was, and not who took the initiative, buyer or seller?

One of the main attractives of Bitcoin for me is more economic freedom, so I cringe when I hear people talk about price controls, in this case for transactions fees. Granted, localbitcoins may choose to do that, but the whole idea seems backward.
Fees will drop as Bitcoins become available from more sources, not the other way around.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:43:43
Sure, I understand that. It just seems to me that the discussion on why the price is dropping should concentrate on understanding why the fiat money is not coming in as it did at other times. The bitcoin production curve is the one factor that has been known all along.

But what follows stagnation? The drop in value of the currency, making it more appealing to lend it and invest in something than hoard it.
People will hoard it untill their returns ar low enough to justify taking other risks with their money. It looks more like a cycle to me, and I see no reason why it can't happen in a smooth way.

I don't really *need* a lot of privacy, but I think it is a good thing to have anyway. Is the VPN deal something that people use continuously, or is expensive or otherwise inconvenient to have on all the time?

I think that a lot of people look at only one side of the equation when it comes to price deflation. (Note that there is no inherently inflationary or deflationary currency when it comes to prices since we can have either one by changing the money supply or the suply of goods and services that are chased by that money suply.) It is often pointed out that people will be less willing to spend (even though they will never be able to, or even want to quit buying stuff; think about computers' prices). On the other hand --and this is the part that is usually left out-- people will be more eager to produce stuff that others really want, so that they can increase their stash of this powerful currency. 
The only difference I see is that a price deflationary currency will produce more of what you actually want or need, and with an price-inflationary one more crap will be produced, since holding to the currency will only cost you in terms of real goods and services you will be able to buy.
Another point is that people will hoard bitcoins very hard as long as they think that there is a big potential for growth of its value. As it increases towards their targets, they will be more inclined to spend them. 
As a thought experiment, think what would happen if the Bitcoin network was already fully built, access to it was universal and all the 21 million of them got airdropped to the world's population, 3 milibits per person. Now, people with little stuff would be more inclined to exchange their coins for things that they need, and those with more would not be as inclined. Coins would move one way and stuff would go the other way, as it is the case with any currency, but the point here is that after a month, or maybe a year rolls over some equilibrium would be reached, and with the world's economy denominated in boicoins there is no more reason to believe that they will necessarily appreciate in value as its value would only depend on the further increase of the supply of real goods and services from that point on.
Edit: fixing typos.

People learn with those bad experiences, so that impacts like Gox's should become more rare over time, and so that if and when the Bitcoin economy gets as big as that of the United States that simply won't happen at all.
If you regulate that decision making away from the bitcoin holders, then they will indeed never learn to protect their assets. Then, in the future, it would be (a momentary) catastrophy to remove those costly safegards. 
Regulation is a self fulfilling profecy.

Interesting. I have never considered Bitcoin's inflation to be a problem before (if adoption happens too soon). It seems that right now we have an instantaneous Bitcoins inflation rate of 10.76% a year (following [this guy's post] ( and updating the values). Indeed, if we reach full adoption today, then this would be a problem for some time, but it is probably already better than Argentina and some other places on the planet. Also, it will take some time for that large adoption to materialize, so by then it will probably not be a problem.

Temporarily extending the discount even beyond 20%, say 50% off for a week or two, would really nudge your costumers to start using Bitcoin which IMHO should be your biggest immediate goal. After they learn how to do it, you can adjust your optimal everyday discount.

If this mining centralization is going to be a big vulnerability, I'd rather have us deal with it sooner than later. 
I don't think Bitcoin would sucumb to such an attack, and even if it does something better would take its place.
If Bitcoin is 10x bigger when there is such an attack and a lot more people lose money, I fear that that might be used to produce bad regulation to "protect" people from such risks.

If you have 1 BTC that I want to borrow, would you lend me that in order to receive anything less than 1 BTC in, say, a year? What would be your incentive for doing so?
I realize that, for example, 0.8 BTC might buy more stuff in a year than 1 BTC does now, but if you don't lend, then, in a year, you will have 1 BTC instead of 0.8 BTC, which buys even more stuff.
Could you give an example of what you are suggesting?

If inflation/deflation really is as big as a problem as people think, then why would anyone want to have just a few people (government) working on solving it, using basically the same tool (control of the money supply) over and over again?
By taking the ability to control the money supply away from the government, we give the problem back for the whole world to actively work on and come up with new solutions. 
And that is assuming that is assuming that global fluctuations of price signals are a problem, which by it self I don't think they are. Price fluctuations are information people should want to have so they can work on their real causes!

Not sure I followed you explanation.
It seems to me that if deflation is on, specially at the high rates we see now, there is no incentive to lend coins, so it won't happen. At some point this lack of credit will have an effect on the economic activity, and when it starts to drop (hopefully it will be gradually) Bitcoin will start to have inflation, at which point, lending coins out makes sense. People will have their credit, start producing more goods and services, inflation will drop and so will the lending of coins; eventually we might even get deflation again, so the cycle repeats...

I don't think it is about how much resources the miners have, but rather how efficiently they are able to mine.
When there is high competition, profit margins drop, and if you had comparatively inefficient machines, your operation will become economically inviable sooner. As soon as these operations leave the market, profit margins increase again for those who were able to stay. Now everybody sees it and are tempted to go back in the game, so the cycle repeats.. 
But note: the inefficient miners of today have been the efficient ones previously. There is no reason to assume that these new efficient miners will have their comfortable position unchallenged by more ingenuous competitors; that is, of course, unless it becomes possible for them to regulate their competition out of the game, which is the usual way we see monopolies emerge.

Actuall, given that Sharedcoin might have to be forced to deanonimize the transactions under a court order, isn't it better to use the Dark Wallet?

I never understand why these transfers are seen by some as big sell outs, and not big buy ins. Only thing we know is that the coins have moved. Maybe the person selling them got contacted by some investor wanting to buy.
Same goes for the assumption of "privileged information". Why assume it is the seller, and not the buyer who is best informed?
@_date: 2014-07-21 12:52:41
In a way, yes. I am sorry that this is such a bitter lesson to learn this way, but Bitcoin is a decentralized technology and if you treat it as a centralized one, then you will incur the risks associated to doing so. Keeping your coins at a third party host, be it an exchange, "bank" or wallet provider is missing the point completely; it is like trying to use a flashlight as a hammer. 
Information propagates, and when something like Gox's failure happens people get smarter and it gets harder to repeat the fiasco/heist.
Remember, the reason we have Bitcoin is because the current financial system is obsolete and should be replaced, and IMO that is largely because of regulation. Inviting or supporting legislation that treats it like the legacy system is a terrible idea.

Right now, I would be happy if I could do a multisig or coinjoin transaction "by hand" in the reference client, for example. I would also like to understand better the issues with scaling the blocksize and its proposed solutions, like the one that involves inverse Bloom filters.

I don't understand that well how Electrum works, but I am glad my comment helped you to find out a way to make your method safer :)
I just remembered working out once that 6^99 was roughly the number of total Bitcoin private keys. But I guess when you stick to 6^53 there is a compromise: your key universe is still huge (although much smaller than the total key space) and you hope to remember some sequence of words that will get generated by your 53 dice rolls. Like using a brain wallet, except it is way stronger, right?
Is there some tutorial out there on how Electrum works? It is pretty cool that you are able to just read the code and improve it "that easily".

If some level of skill is required to run the mining operations, then some level of "centralization" is expected, simply because only people that can do a good job at that will remain.
I do not have a very good technical understanding of mining but, from what I've heard so far:
* P2Pool is just not competitive enough for the moment to pull in a lot of mining power.
* Making the PoW depend on different puzzles may help to level the mining field, since the ASICS already out there are specialized for doing SHA256 only. Andreas has mentioned that even solving Sudoku puzzles could work as PoW.
* Of course, over time new ASICS could be made to do those things too, so that people have also suggested implementing PoW that changes dynamically according to the capacity of the network to solve each kind of puzzle.
* In the past, contracts for renting GH/s turned out to be scams. I never heard of a successful venture of that kind yet, so I remain skeptical for the time being...
* As far as avoiding 51% attacks, PoS (proof of stake) could help since it significantly raises the cost of such an attack from having to buy 51% of the mining equipment to having to buy 51% of the coins. PoS have the added advantage of not wasting energy, but has its own problems too, apparently.
Like I said, I am not completely sure of those things, so if anybody would like to correct me please do so.

The last massive bubble shouldn't be a bubble at all. At that stage, it will just mean that the economy previously based on fiat will be based on crypto, meaning that people will be more worried about how many bits they have rather than how many dollars they is worth.

This kind of argument never worked to solve any instance of the tragedy of the commons and mining centralization is going to be no exception, and that is with good reason: miners are self-interested agents like all of us. Until the system rules change to make that kind of behaviour unfavourable, it is useless to keep asking for self sacrifice.
Like Milton Friedman once put: "A system which depends on the right man is a bad system".

I am not sure, but intuitively to me it seems that the n^2 term comes from assuming that each possible connection between members of the network adds to its utility. But if there are say 1 million users in the network, the vast majority of users don't use anything close to these 1 million connections. In fact, assuming that they get to use C*log (n) connections, that tells us that if the total number of users go up by a factor of 10, each user's utility goes up by C, instead of growing tenfold. 
I don't know about you, but the logarithmic increase in utility seems more realistic to me.

This is just so they can claim later that the regulation was crafted using feedback from the community, regardless of how hurtful it ends up being. It is an attempt to legitimize unrequested outside intervention, based on problems that don't yet exist and which wouldn't require regulation to solve anyway.
It is important that some people engage and try to make this law less detrimental, but it is even more important to make the statement that we are much better off without it.
Bitcoin is not a new financial instrument, it is a new financial system. Trying to treat it like the old one is useless and misses the point.

I could be wrong, but I think Andreas once said that that would not require a hard fork. In any case, if it ever comes to choosing between changing the PoW and having a centralized mining, my bet is that regardless of how ugly the hard fork would be the community would switch to the less centralized version.
Any theories on how powerful mining and network effect influence each other? Which one drives the other? I am thinking that miners will want to mine whatever most people are using; on the other hand, having powerful mining gives security to the network, which helps increase the network effect.

I agree that there should be a monetary incentive for running a full node, but I am not sure if I can imagine something viable yet. Maybe have the miners give part (say half) of the fee collected in a transaction to the node that reported it. That node in turn could give half of that reward to the one that reported that transaction to it, and so on.

True, but a lot (perhaps most?) of people building the network are invested in Bitcoin and would like to see it take off as a true world currency because that, the network effect, is what will ultimately give value to their tokens.
Ideologically, I also think it is desirable to have a universal currency, which is censorship resistant etc, so I think people will/should try to solve the scalability issue with Bitcoin itself before pushing the problem for altchains or lightening network.
I feel that the privacy problem is way more urgent than the scalability, at this stage. (Too bad Monero has inflation built into it... I wonder how long until people come up with a truly private currency, which would also be a store of value. I would be moving into it already!)

Bitcoin was made (as far as I can tell) to replace such a system precisely because of over regulation and control. Although it is desireable to connect with the legacy system to onboard money and new users, we have to be careful to net become contaminated by the same problems.


Sure, the protocol might always accept coinjoin transactions, but if that stuff becomes criminalized, or otherwise banned in points of sale etc, then you don't really have that much usable privacy. If privacy is not the default, it becomes easier to single out, isolate and criminalize those who choose to use it. If privacy were the default, then I am sure that those who actively chose to be more transparent for whatever reason would not face the same problem.


That is the problem right there. People are tempted to sell out ideologically too soon. Some in the community would make a lot of money, but the world would miss out in having a superior financial system. I am hoping for the best, but expecting the worst...

We will never get to be effectivelly heard until we come up with a new system.

Bitcoin-XT shall be just called **Bitcoin** since it stays true to the original vision of Satoshi's paper and of those early adopters who invested their time, money, energy and reputation on the idea of a universal form of cash.
If a certain temporary fix which is meant to be removed becomes a permanent aspect of a coin, hindering its ability to scale, we shall call this a **CrippledCoin**.
And if the developers stop representing the original view of the currency by virtue of a conflict of interest, say for being part of a company that wants to build a competing currency, or payment processing network, or that wants to burry Bitcoin as a secondary layer, then we shall call it **CooptedCoin**.

Bitcoin, the first and most widely used cryptocurrency, has been suffering because the failure to remove an anti-spam fix which was meant to be temporary and has been crippling its growth ever since it was put in place. The decision to remove it has (surprisingly to many) become a point of contention.
The Core devs that want to preserve this network capacity artificial cap have serious conflicts of interest since they became part of Blockstream, a company that seeks to build their own payment system *on top of* the Bitcoin network, and in doing so it would relegate the Bitcoin network to a secondary hidden role, like a settlement layer for the payment channels of *their* network, instead of letting it be the accessible-to-all network Bitcoin was meant to be.
In response, a few ex-Core developers have come up with Bitcoin-XT, which stays true to Bitcoin's original vision, but updating the Bitcoin software to Bitcoin-XT will split the community, at least temporarily, in two groups with different rules. The mods of this subreddit are largely aligned with the Blockstream folks, or are otherwise against forking Bitcoin to increase the cap, and have thus been banning a lot of posts and comments on Bitcoin-XT, hence the commotion you are witnessing.
Edit: you might want to read [this]( 
Edit 2: Core has been capitalized in ex-Core as suggested by below.
Edit 3: I am pretty sure Gavin hasn't left Core's development in the sense of having access to their Github project and developing Bitcoin client software that could be used in Core's code, but politically it seems to me that Mike and him are not with the Core team any more.

A better model and analogy would be to compare holding Bitcoin as investing in a regular business. Would you buy a stock that doesn't give you proportional voting power, and that allows every man on the street to have a say on how the company is run? I wouldn't. 
It should be clear which of the two models is more efficient in creating value and solving real problems.

1 M coins over 14 M is less than 10%, and less than 5%, if you consider all 21 M cap. But the important thing is that not even Satoshi controls the bitcoin economy as he can only spend his coins once. This is a key difference from from our legacy system, where great wealth is looked at with great suspicion due to its ability to influence political favors from those able to create new money.

Liquid Democracy is just an hoest framework for collective decision making, where people deem it necessary or legitimate, whatever that might mean. The acknowledgement that there is a better way of doing democracy doesn't imply a moral argument in favor of forcing democratic decisions onto others, which I too abhor. Nonetheless, we would be much better of using LD while we figure other ways to make collective decisions or how to get rid of them once and for all, if that is possible.
(As an aside: consensus is a hard thing to reach, so a positive side effect is that we would end up having less laws, and arguably only the important ones.)

It would be interesting if the second bot tried to outbid the first one by using a higher fee, and then the third bot with an even higher one. If the first one can detect that, then it could try sending another transaction with a fee higher than his first transaction. Second bot could do the same, and so on... In that scenario, we could see all the money going to the miner.
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:57:38
Yeah, with increased utility due to bigger network effect, we can expect the bitcoin price in USD to rise, so it seems that a better assumption would be that fees remain more or less constant in dollar value.

Early adopters have a lot of skin in the game! It doesn't matter if someone paid a 100 usd for holdings of a few million dollars now, the present value is what counts for what they stand to lose if Bitcoin fails in any meaningful way. Not wanting to lose a fortune in Bitcoin is a pretty powerful incentive to not screw things up.
The corruption in our political system is only that because some people are playing against the rule that says "one person, one vote" when they shouldn't. 
There is nothing corrupt about a system that is openly run by its major stake holders, and the participation in which is completely voluntary.

The use of the new version number just works as a voting mechanism for miners using Bitcoin-XT, so that if at some point there are 750 blocks using that version out of the 1000 most recent ones, then all nodes running XT will turn on a switch that says that within two weeks from that point in time, they will start considering valid blocks relayed which are at most 8MB in size, and not the previous 1MB. This behaviour will differ from the remaining 25% or less of the network. Then, and only then, will the so called hard fork occur (and it can't occur before Jan 11 2016 also) but when it happens it will not be "contentious" any more.
Even if there were to exist two competing blockchains, your (pre-fork) coins will be on both of them. The chance of those two blockchain remaining relevant going forward is IMO very small, since miners on the &lt;25% will be highly incentivized to not stay in the wrong side of history.
Hopefully this episode will bring about a new paradigm of software voting to reach consensus in a more active way.
I wouldn't sell my coins, if anything you might end up with a more useful, and therefore more valuable, Bitcoin after the the fork. After all, you can't fight the evils of the world's legacy financial system with a currency that only handles 100 thousand transactions per day, that can't be very inclusive ;)

That is too slow, and below the network's potential even now! Maybe if we had 50MB by now that would sound a bit better, but still slow growth rate.

As a general rule, it is bad to to have governments just *provide* people with stuff. It gives the impression that whatever is being provided is free, when in reality that is just *forcing* you to pay for someone else's education, regardless of how bad of an "investment" that might be (yes, because people can grossly overpay even for essential services, like basic schooling, health etc).
Even when it comes to very basic education, which pretty much everyone agrees that everyone else should have access to, the effects of heavily subsidizing it can be pretty bad. Subsidies of a good or service take away the consumer's voice, thus contributing to poorer quality of service or product. Vouchers for schools would already be an improvement, but if you keep throwing money at the system, then you end up with a bubble (perhaps in teacher's salaries, or school administrators') like the tuition bubble we have in college now in.
It is better to work on solving the problem of why people are not being able to pay for their own education, and then be more selective on the loans we do give out.

But we've seen that miners can mine new blocks using just the previous block's header while they take the time to verify its validity. If they do it in time, then they get to mine a new block with new thansactions in it.
The way I see it, there are two cases assuming they just mined an empty block: (i) the previous block was valid, in which case they just blindly contributed to increasing the longest chain's difficulty, and therefore its security; or (ii) the previous block was invalid, and they will both get discarded by the network, in which case this attack would prove very costly, not just for the miner that mined the empty block, but most importantly for the attacker.
It seems to me that the same game theoretic considerations that make a 51% attack unprofitable (namely that it is simpler, easier and more profitable to play by the rules) would play a role in preventing this attack also.

The transaction output can only be spent in a trsnsaction mined in a block that is beyond a certain height.
So I could send out a transaction that would be mined today, with an output sending some coins to an address which you control, but which could only be used as an input for another transaction after say block 700000 (i.e. in ~5 years).

Coinjoin is a pretty simple idea: yoi and I have outputs we would like to spend, but we wouldn't like to let people know where we send our money to, so we create a single transaction that spends both our output and assign coins to the addresses we wanted them to go. Such a tx requires our signatures, but once in the blockchain it would be impossible for an outside observer to know where our coins went.
Also, it is indistinguishable from a transaction that simply spwnds more than one input creating more than one output, so I realize my request might be kind of silly...

A lot of people see their btc as savings, and with the prices stable and far from its perceived potential, spending btc right now is not attractive at all. Merchants need to start offering btc discounts.

Block space and transaction verification time are not free, and also fees will still be at play, but most importantly, bitcoins value comes from the network's utility. A miner that could produce huge blocks might voluntarily choose not to, just for considering that this might be perceived as a problem in the network, much like we have seen big mining pools voluntarily split up or limit their size in the past.
Another point that just occured to me: if the problem is the time it takes to verify a block, and miners have different performances at doing that, maybe implementing a feature (if such a thing does not exist yet) that would allow nodes to relay that a certain block is invalid, say by referring to the invalid transaction, would allow slower nodes to just check that and discard invalid blocks more quickly. (It could work similarly to Gavin's idea of reporting the first attemp double spend a coin) This would reduce the time to reject an invalid block to the one of the fastest node on the network, even though the time to check that a block is valid would remain the same (although a slow node's confidence about a certain block's validity would increase as no messages reporting it invalid are received as time progresses), but again, being able to process a lot of valid transactions shouldn't be viewed as a problem.
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:49:58
I think you are correct. Plus, the objection about the other 75% "being able to kill it" doesn't make a lot of sense, given that they would be much better off by just contributing constructively to one of the chains. Such an attack has great opportunity costs, especially when the Chinese miners realize the would still be fine mining the 8 mb blocks they said they could handle.

At its peak, Bitcoin's market cap was something like 12 billion usd. So if the structured buy was taking place up to that point, it would have just added 1 billion to those 12.

I don't think blocks would necessarily increase indefinitely just because there isn't an explicit hard limit on its size. See my other [comment]( below.
I don't know about networks in general, but one case that comes to mind is email before and after gmail. I believe that spam messages can still be sent out but their filters are very good at catching them and treating them accordingly.
In any case, having a block size limit affects *all transactions* equally, so I don't see how that helps with spam. If anything, if that is the "solution", then the spammers won...

One nice idea to generate some revenue and remain ad free is to use [Glidera]( which allows any wallet that embeds their code to have a buy-bitcoin button, like a Circle or Coinbase wallets do. This would give Mycelium part of the revenue from the bitcoin sales (I believe 0.2% to the wallet, and 0.8% to Glidera) and thus at least partially solve the problem of funding development and maintenance. This solves an extra problem: Mycelium users don't have to try a competing wallet just to fund theirs.

What is the point of not allowing you to see it again?

Hey Paxful,
Great job getting so many people onboard and educated about Bitcoin! I wish you can continue doing that for a long time.
That said, even though the video is good, you might want to consider making a new one soon.
As pointed out by everybody, btc is not anonymous, so maybe saying that and with such emphasis may not be such a goid idea.
Also, that was a ton of steps in that video! Do you really have to teach people to copy and paste?
Why stress so much that the wallet is free? It is not like other btc wallets are paid for, and also at this level people probably just think of their bitcoin with paxful as their account anyway. Couldn't you leave it at that?
The girl in the video did a great job, but she looked pretty tense throught.
Sorry for being so critical, but I am pretty sure you can make a better video :)

That is why **privacy** is just as important as encryption, and Bitcoin is sorely missing that unfortunately. 
We need a viable implementation of coinjoin asap (does dark wallet still work?), and it needs to be the default for all users in most if not all wallets, lest we'll lose our place as the dominant cryptocurrency to those which offer a solution to the privacy problem, like Monero does for example.

But this lack of privacy is no worse then when you buy at Circle or Coinbase and then move the coins to your own wallet, since Glidera doesn't keep users' funds, be it fiat or crypto AFAIK. I believe you just connect your bank account, give them the destination address of your choosing and once you send the sell order money comes out of your bank account into Glidera's, and they immediately send the coins out.
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:46:57
Yeah, I heard about that in an interview a founder gave at LTB. It sounded indeed like an interesting concept, but hard to use, plus it doesn't happen automatically, but involves a involves a negotiation of sorts. If anyone has used it, could you share your experience?
Also, I feel like something like this should be the default, and ideally at some point a big wallet should take that plunge. They could for instance enable a coinshuffle system that say every day (or as needed, according to some internal wallet rule) would automatically send all user's yet unmixed coins out in a coinjoin transaction, mixing it with the coins of say other 9 users, and this transaction would produce only outputs of say 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 btc which would then be ready to spend after that. The identifiable small change of each user could be used as the miner fee for that big mixing transaction.

Coinjoin to be largely implemented by default by major wallets.
With no mixing, there is no privacy and fungibility of coin, and without those a currency won't be largely adopted.

@_date: 2015-09-10 17:43:37
Coinjoin is just the name of the concept of producing transactions that spend inputs from different parties. If badly implemented, it might leak information about the ownership of the coins.
Look up [Coinshuffle]( There is a nice and accessible Bitcoin Talk post explaining how three users can communicate to privatelly produce a coinjoin transaction such that no one knows each other's outputs.
[Here]( is an illustration of a successful run of the protocol.
Edit: link and picture added.
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:00:04
The problem is that bitcoins will be inaccessible to pretty much everyone, and will thus lose their value as a transactional currency. Lightening hubs will become points of failure, even though they might not be able to run with the money. Most importantly: the LN can very well exist and do all its good work without insisting on stifling Bitcoin's growth as a standalone currency, as it was always meant to be. Doing so is a very visible and dishonest nudge to push everyone into using LN, and it is not appreciated for people how bought into Bitcoin either financially or ideologically.

I can confirm that it works wonderfully. I have been using, and actively promoting it for more than a month now and never had a problem.
Just yesterday, I got in line at Starbucks with just one person ahead of me. I pulled the phone out, loaded the card, paid and got my bitcoin change back at my wallet by the time I had the coffee in my hands. The whole thing took less than 30 seconds, and the actual paying part is faster than using plastic!
I should also emphasize that there is no sign up required, nor do you have to install an app (even thought their name might suggest otherwise), and there is no learning curve to use this. It is just a few clicks on their website and you are done.

I heard this claim before. Could you explain how do we know that, and why that transaction is not spendable?
From what you said, it seems to me that that coinbade tx's output is not in the UTXO. If that is the case, do we know whether that was intentional, or unavoidable by a quirk of design etc?
@_date: 2015-09-10 15:43:32
Yeah, coinjoin is really the way to go, but it is important that it gets implemented as the *default* in any respectable wallet (kind of like what happened with respect to address reuse and HD wallets). Users won't go through the extra trouble unless they really need to, and that is bad. For this privacy applications we need a big anonymity set, the more people mixing the better!
@_date: 2015-09-16 02:14:17
What does that mean? 
@_date: 2015-11-02 12:53:29
If price is not going up as it did then, it should tell you all your need to know: that there isn't so much new money coming into Bitcoin as there was then. And why should there be? At that point in time, we were seeing the emergence of potentially the first universal form of cash! And now we know that that can't be the case due to the our artificially imposed scalability restrictions.. so I don't see why the price should be going up at all. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:24:32
The correct implementation IMO is to let your wallet do these transactions automatically when a lot of people are available, not when you want to spend your coins. For instance, you could have it set up such that you only spend mixed coins, and the unmixed ones (changes from your past transactions) go to a "mixing pocket" in your wallet which is dedicated to mixing them. Once mixed, they go back to your "spending pocket". Furthermore, you could have it set up so that all outputs of the coinjoin transaction have just a few denominations. For instance, I could send 2.57384092 coins as an input, and get back as outputs like:
The small difference 0.00004092 btc, which would identify you, could be left as miner's fee. (You don't have to have so many outputs, just enough to make most of your transactions fit within one or two of them. It is an optimization problem figuring out the best denominations, but I am confident that people will figure that out.)
You can set up the minimum amount and time frame to have your coins mixed, but it should have mixing enabled by default. All these wallets would have to do is post a warning about the fact that mixing will happen at the cost of a cent or so per turn. As long as they let users disable that if they want, I see no problem with that. Disabling it should come with a warning that not having privacy comes with a cost too though :)
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:32:00

Can someone please ELI5: what is the problem with the blockchain getting big? Isn't it possible to make so that full nodes store only some blocks, such that when it is time to look up its content we are guaranteed to find it with some one in the network? As long as we guarantee that there are say 100 copies of each block spread evenly over the full nodes, shouldn't it be fine?
Also, if the problem  is block propagation speeds and orphan blocks, isn't that a risk that would be equally increased for all miners regardless of their mining power, in which case they would still claim the same proportion of block rewards?
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:47:45
Say they have 1 million usd worth of local currency in a store in some country other than the US. At some point that reserve will have been spent for paying the receivers of the remittances. How do they keep paying the next orders? At this point, sending btc and selling it for local currency could do that. 
Btw, I am not sure how they actually solve that nowadays. How would using their own internal ledger work for making cash appear in the other end? 
@_date: 2015-10-30 13:51:56

The problem with the representative democracy we have is that it is really not representative at all.
In Liquid Democracy you can have a representative if you would like, but you are not forced to. That is the main difference.
If your vote is set to follow mine with respect to say education bills and you didn't like the way I voted last time, then you go online and set to follow the vote of someone else you might think has a better understanding of the issues. If you don't find anyone, then you can vote yourself, or not vote at all. In fact, we could have dynamic voting, so you could even withdraw your support for that bill you ended up voting for, but didn't want to. That way we guarantee that at any single point in time the laws that govern your life are a much more meaningful expression of the majority consensus of those that are governed by the same laws.

Cool, I agree with your analysis. The only thing now is not to forget where the mispellings or capital letters occur.
I saw a comment suggesting forming passwords using some simple password, but then you break it in half, say if tha password is SqueamishOssifrage, we use SHA256(SHA256(Squeamish)Ossifrage) instead, which looks like this: 73e4addbb3564621004ae2ed0658b78ed3a37e6e56c1ed8e5a563a6f6384c984

My thoughts, exactly!
I agree that there could be other and better implementations of not only Direct, but better yet of *Liquid* Democracy, specially for voting in other political spheres.
Actually, I used to spend a lot of time thinking about these implementations as a way to solve, among other things, the problem of institutionalized theft, i.e. taxes and inflation, and then I learned about Bitcoin and that just seemed to by pass all the discussion, potentially, so I fell in love with the idea. Now it is nice to think that maybe on top of all the things that the protocol already does, it could also give voice to the participants with respect to its own future development :)

You can sign a message without sending any coins. It would just allow people to know you do actually own that address.
Weighting opinions based on how much you are invested in something works for companies. I would see no problem with that, even considering that I would pretty much not have a voice in that case.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:38:56
What is the tone?
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:01:11
Regarding the increase in size of blocks and blockchain, and the possible inability of most users to keep a copy of the whole blockchaing in their computers: What would be the problem in having each full node store just some blocks, instead of them all? If they have the full block heather sequence, and there are enough nodes keeping copies of each block, shouldn't that be enough? I always felt that decentralization was important because it didn't allow a single entity to edit the blockchain at will, which would seem to be unaffected by this.
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:38:28
Precisely. One change (eliminating the 21 million cap) makes every holder of Bitcoin worse off, while the the other (increasing its divisibility) might add to its utility in the future, and therefore would make every holder better off. Sure, they both might require a hard fork (not sure if the divisibility does) but apart from that, indeed one is nearly impossible to fathom while the other makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:13:15

@_date: 2013-11-11 03:01:41
Thanks. Apparently, we just have to ask Gavin Adressen to reintroduce the feature :)
Edit: From Gavin himself (not sure if I understand his objection...):
"Time-in-the-future transactions are non-standard (as of 0.8?  I can never remember when things happened...)
Why: because there is a fill-up-memory denial of service attack, and it really isn't reasonable to expect the entire network to store your timelocked transactions "forever".
Even in the past, the statement "unspendable by the sender because of replacement not being implemented" was not true.  Wait long enough and only a subset of the network will have the timelocked transaction (because new nodes, old nodes restarting, etc). Broadcast a double-spending version without a timelock and it will get mined fairly soon."

It seems that this tainting of addresses may be really harmful to the fungibility of bitcoins, since it coud produce two types of addresses, tainted and untainted, and people would not know at first from which they were getting the coins. What if then there was a way to make every address tainted?!
Say an address has been tainted. Couldn't it keep sending random small transactions to every hyterto untainted bitcoin addresses with a positive balance in the block chain? Maybe a bot could do that, sending random amounts at random times, and of course many different tainted addresses could be the source.
Bottom line: if all addresses are tainted, that could be a problem at first if Coin Validation is already operational, but then at least every bitcoin address would be in the same category and we would have fungibility again.
Edit: just correcting typos
Edit 2: PS.: Of course, the owners of the tainted addresses would have to authorize the transactions, I don't think there would be any other way, but they would probably be glad to do it.
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:45:13
From what I was gathering, if I send you coins, and the transaction gets mined, then the coins in that transaction will remain unspent untill you try to spend them, in which ocasion the blockchain will be checked for all your transactions with unspent coins. So one thing seems to be that those transactions could be there forever and that wouldn't be a problem, because they are already in the blockchain. So what if instead of having only the two states "spent" or "unspent", we could have a new one: "spendable if last block mined has height at least X"? That way the time constraint would be included in the blockchain.
Does that make sense, or am I too far off of what the protocol can do?

I tried changing one character of a valid address and I seem to remember Bticoin-qt or whatever I was using complain it was not a valid address, which was reassuring because it suggested me that Bitcoin valid addresses are probably rare among the alpha numeric strings of that size, and therefore you were unlikely to loose coins if you make a typo.
Does anybody know how to check whether a given string is a valid address? It seems that the final segment of 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, f59kuE,  might be there just to make it a valid address. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:11:18
I feel this might be a very basic question since this is the first time I even hear about VPS, but what is the point of using it? I have been running Bitcoin-qt with more than 8 connections pretty much anytime that I check, usually I have more than 20. Don't I run a full node already?
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:40:25
So no extra incentives to provide an extra node for the network?
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:57:58
What about creating a tiny output in the transaction (optional full node fee) that will go to the first node that relays that transaction? I am assuming that this could be done and that every full node would have more or less the same chance of being the first one to validate / check a transaction. This would appeal to the lottery incentive that attracts so many miners. I am also imagining that if you leave your full node connected for enough time, the it will form more connections and thus make it more likely earn some micro btc.
I realize that this might not make sense because my knowledge of the network is superficial...

If the balance is zero, then that is how much that vote would count. Vote with all your addresses. After counting, the weight of your vote will correspond to the sum of your addresses' balances.
I have no problem with people in the foundation having a lot of power. If they are invested in 1000x as me, then they stand to gain or loose 1000x more than me, so why should our votes have the same weight?

I think you should raise that bet substantially. That would be a way to convince people, and make you some extra coins.

@_date: 2013-11-14 11:38:53
Only trust a private key you have created yourself. If, for instance, you did that in their computer I would advise you to realocate your coins immediately. Also, I would only trust a wallet that I seeded myself, like in bitaddress.org (offline of course) you can create a "brain wallet" by just typing a random sequence of some 50 characters, not so you can remember it, but just you know how it was generated. Then encrypt the wallet obtained this way.
I probably don't need to tell you this, but do not use a brain wallet with a password simple enough that you can remember it, your coins may be stolen that way!

Me too. Kept seeing the prices reach close to 1 dollar and knew I had to open a MtGox account, but didin't do it... Only woke up on March 18, the day of the FINCEN guidance. By then it was too late.

Here is what I have so far:
I too filled in the form for oppening the IAFCU account just a few hours after seeing AudenX's email. It too me almost a week to have my account open, but today I was able to talk to Kathy on the phone and she provided my account number, so I just submitted it to Bitfloor, in which page now it reads: "Your refund information is under review. Once reviewed, your refund will be sent to you electronically."
Good luck to you all, and many thanks to AudenX and all the people at IAFCU for stepping in to help us!

You are using a lot of jargon that I don't understand. Would you care to explain what sttagered buys, chep coins and skrillex mean please?
I am wondering what happens if you have your money out waiting to buy at those discounted prices and then the price moves up by a lot. You can still reajust your buying orders and go from there, but you will have many less coins for your money, correct? And couldn't it also go the other way fast, so that you end up buying but then the new price is way lower than what you have spent?

One thing that worries me: since btc will be treated as a commodity, then I imagine that people trading it will have to pay capital gains taxes. Does anyone know if that is the case, and if so, how much? Also, would it be any different if btc were legaly considered a currency, or would people have to pay capital gains anyway? I am trying to gauge whether that will limit the speed of btc circulation. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:43:08
Thanks for the hint and the tip! I will look into those alt-coin.

Crypto might sound a bit obscure or shady to some people, like it is somenthing people would want to keep in secret.
I think that there are better features to be advertised in the way we refere to bitcoins, like decentralized, peer-to-peer, internet or voluntary currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:15:24
Thanks for the links. From what I understood that it is an arbitrary limit, but imposed to protect the network from reaching an actual physical limit. I understand that it is not a problem right now, but I would like to know how could we increase the actual limit, because in the future I hope we will have to use more.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:16:05
What happens if one "sells" the contract at 0.55 and is NOT proven correct, do they have to come up with $10 to pay for each contract? If so, I imagine it should be deposited in advance, right? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:44:23
Thanks. I would assume that if there is a trully competitive advantage in oe of the upcoming alt-coins, then everyone in the Bitcoin community would like to see that implemented in the Bitcoin protocol. I guess my question is how flexible is the protocol to implement those changes, should there be an interest. Is there any hard coded limitation to what can be changed?
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:01:33
That is news to me. In such a situation, why can't the bank just handle Bitfloor (and not Roman) a check?

If prices of Bitcoin continue to spike fast and more and more people get start to using the network (specially if the Senate hearing goes well), then maybe well will soon have an overloaded network that cannot process all the transactions and therefore fees will have to rise, at least while the network capacity catches up.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:38:52
It is going to be beautiful to see Bitcoin helping argentinians show a huge middle finger to their thieves in power. In a way I almost hope that the government would push harder so we can see even faster adoption there.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:19:24
So basically Coinbase doesn't wait for six confirmations and take that risk of giving the merchant their money right away?
By the way, does the network reject a double spend transaction if the first one hasn't yet been included in the blockchain?

I just tried to post an order in MtGox and the site was essentially irresponsive (I guess that is the lag). So I was wondering if any of you know whether I should expect to have it executed later.

That is a nice thought, that Bitcoin will make more people migrate to Linux. I hope the trend continues. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:44:12
This seems very interesting! I always wanted to understand how the protocol works in this lower level. 
I can't say I understood that much of you said, except that the protocol seems to be much more sophisticated then I was imagining.
Could you please tell me where can I find some basic material about it and what are the prerequisites? I just took a few semesters in programming in college some years ago.
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:00:09
I used to love to hear this guy talk about economics, but when it comes to Bitcoin his arguments don't seem to make sense... Is it just me or it even sounds like he is being intelectually dishonest? Maybe he is just trying to protect his huge gold investiments.
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:10:31
I believe when you want to move the coins, you provide the encrypted private key (the long sequence starting with a '6') to some bitcoin client that supports that format of encryption, e.g. blockchain wallet. Then it will prompt you to type in the password. If it is a match, then it proceeds with the transaction.
I saw somebody commenting that one of the things that makes this kind of wallet more secure is that you need to try a password with a fixed (encrypted) private key, and also that the BIP0038 takes sometime to check whether you have the right password, rendering impractical the brute force approach.
Everybody, please let me know if I am getting this wrong somewhere.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:00:24
Thanks, that makes sense.
Edit: I was able to generate the wallet consisting of all 5's and all zeros and 1 at the last digit, so I am not sure which ones are is missing.. 
Edit 2: Never mind, 6^99 is smaller than 2^256 :)

I had never heard of FORTH before, nad had no idea Bitcoin had a language of its own, or that there was something as stack architecture. I have been reading this subreddit and its references the whole night now.
That helps a lot! Thanks for the detailed explanation.

How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:07:51
This thing about the intrinsic value of gold causes a lot of confusion, IMO. Firstly, it accounts for only a small part of the price of gold (the biggest part is just due to speculation that gold will remain popular choice for store of vaue). Secondly, and much more important, the fact that gold had such high intrinsic value was important to have it seeded around and therefore usable as money. Intrinsic value plays an important role in the history of money for that reason, but it is not a necessary condition for money, as we are seeing. In fact, it is a nice thing that we will probably have cheaper gold available soon so we can all enjoy more of its intrinsic value for a change.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:49:23
If you are going to encrypt it, why not store it in the cloud already?
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:38:00
Sure, thanks. 
I did find a program that does BIP encryption on your given private key, but is works only in windows, which raises red flags of its own to me. I just whish they wouldmake that avaliable in bitaddress too. It shouldn't be that hard.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:30:25
I meant that maybe they have a lot of coins but aren't so many as to be the majority of them. For instance, I read somewhere that Satoshi alone could have mined 900.000 coins, and he is not in the foundation...
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:33:23
The daily volume at MtGox recently has been of about 60 thousand BTCs, for the last 24 hours, but it just doubled around the time the price fell (it was just now around 130 thousand BTCs), so what we saw was just the effect of somebody cashing out approximately 60 thousand BTCs at once.

Thanks! Keep us posted please.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:11:49
Is it just me, or PS is confusing potential upside with risk?
From what I undertand, Bitcoin had a bigger upside potential at the beginning and ver big risk, but now both have lowered.

@_date: 2013-05-02 00:12:27
From what I understand, since their bank account is being closed, the bank should give them a check with the balance, but they wait 10 business days before doing so to be sure that there are no other claims on the account being processed. It sucks, but according to them there is nothing we can do for the moment.
On the other hand, we should expect some update on the situation pretty soon, since that time period is almost up.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:03:47
Easier said than done. There is no real pattern, and no single big player, so you never know which way thigs are going to go if you look only at price swings. Look at the fundamentals of Bitcoin instead, buy or sell accordingly and only change your position if the fundamentals change. I am no expert, but that is my two cents of financial wisdom for anybody.

I didn't know about this B6 format. Do you know how the conversion works? It is kind of strange to me that we may have all the private keys represented in hexadecimal or B6, since it looks like 3 divides the total number of the latter, but not of the former...
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:39:00
But the thing is that I don't control which private key I am getting encrypted, so for instance, they could be giving me one that they are keeping a copy of... That is why I would like to enter my own private key.

Main responses to Peter's arguments so far can be sumarized as
* FOR NOW some of his objections are true, but things are changing rapidly,
* Bitcoin doesn't need backing, it is its own backing, it is like transferring gold over the internet cables, not a certificate of deposit of gold, and
* Gold can be seized.

You could actually have continuous voting, since you could have a Bot scanning the blockchain, say every 10 minutes, between the addition of new blocks and coming up with the new consensus, because people may have transferred some of their coins. I don't know how could we implement the voting system is such a way as to allow you to change your vote. Maybe just send a new message?!

I am a big fan of Stefan Molyneaux and I am very happy to see his show thriving, so what I am about to say is not intended to raise any kind of suspicion about his donations.
But seeing this I was just thinking that, in general, somebody trying to boost his donations could use the (pseudo-)anonymity of Bitcoins and the sense of conformity in people to make a lot of small self-donations to their public address and be able to give the impression or claim: "See, everybody else is doing it. Are you going to be the only one not doing your part?" Such arguments can be very compelling!

Isn't the transaction a record of some coins having already being spent? What does it mean that anybody can still spend it? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:47:41
So the first person that saw it, went to Blockchain, Bitcoin-qt, or some other client, provided the transaction id and their public address and that way were able to make another transaction(?) to get the coins? By the way, in that case, did they even need a private key to "spend" the coins?

I have the impression that Reddit might already subscribe new users to that subreddit by default. I remember telling a friend about Reddit, then he signed up and he was a bit bothered that was showing on his list of subredits. (He is a Christian...)

Why not an alt-coin?
By the way, this page  seems to have the wrong link to Peercoin, it redirects to Primecoin.
I am a bit worried about the mining concentration in the Bitcoin ecosystem right now, since pretty much anybody that can go into mining from now on would have to invest millions of dollars to do it competitively, and it actually looks like the kind of investments that maybe only States would be able to produce in the near future. On top of that it takes only two of the largest mining pools to carry a 51% attack (not that they would have any incentive in doing so now). I imagine that the proof-of-stake is there for that reason, but doesn't it also disincentivize new users, and does it mean that new coins will be emmited for ever?
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:11:51
Is that all?! Then I guess I could open one my self too :)
I was thinking they were going to create some Bitcoin derivatives, whatever it was meant by that. But since bitcoins are a commodity, I guess one could have buy and sell options, for one thing.

I don't know the details of how the blocks come into existence, but I think that they record the transactions that happened recently, so could it be that the crash caused the block to take longer to process because of the big number of transactions?

Basic questions: What counts as a node, and what is the impact of having a larger number of nodes? Does that help to increase the number of transactions per second? What is imposing the current limit of 7 transactions per second?
I was wondering if for instance somebody runing a bitcoin-qt in a PC counts as a node, even though they are probably not going to mine any blocks.

I would like to see a Bitcoin client, like bitcoin-qt, that
1) asks for a password before completing transactions;
2) allows you to enter a private key to a paper wallet and sign the transaction (while offline, preferably) so that you can store and access your funds more safely;
3) have the directory containing the wallet.dat file strongly encrypted (I don't know whether this is at all possible while using the client) at least while you are not using the client;
4) periodically offers you to save an encrypted backed-up copy of your wallet.
