"We will be happy to take your money..."
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:56:28
Don't. 
Run far away from here.

This quote is from a cigar, actually.

Wow - a subreddit where I can see the same story re-posted 5 times in a row! SUPER NEAT!

No waaaayyyy, I'm just going to hold onto these Bitcoins until they crash so hard they become subterranean, then maybe I'll use the USD. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:47:26
BUT DUUUDE - I WANT THE BITCOINS BECAUSE SCREW THE SYSTEM, MAN.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:50:51
How about I decentralize your FACE?

The banks will use your petition to light their cigars while they count their real money.

If you send me 4 Bitcoin I can help ... you... oh.
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:37:22
Shhh, you're making too much sense.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:49:26

This post needs to be higher.
"Waaahhhh! This bank that I don't support in the first place won't accept my magical internet money, better stir shit for other people!"
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:13:11
"experts" hahaha.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:23:12
This will end well... Also, you need to stop watching Alex Jones, you sound crazy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:45:01
Easier to swindle grandmas into "investing" in it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:36:00
... the stock market has MUCH more to lose. I don't see your point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:11:09
Yeah, the people buying crypto w/ credit cards have no business "investing" in anything.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:51:07
I'm with you man.
Whenever you hear about cryptocurrency it's always referred to by it's value in USD. Without the USD, cryptocurrency has as much value as Runescape gold.
I look forward to people getting slammed with taxes owed on coins and running to reddit for answers.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:38:45
You better buy the deep dip!

Haven't $billions worth of coins been stolen since December?
