Look again. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 20:07:44
F is so accurate. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:02:27
Well, I got loads of bandwidth (both down and up) to spare, so bring it on!
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:43:29
Will everybody signing up be able to enjoy private beta access?
@_date: 2015-05-23 11:26:47
Why would someone stop accepting bitcoin payments? It doesn't cost anything to accept that right?
@_date: 2015-05-05 12:56:16
This is completely irrelevant and just plain not funny. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 10:26:41
In the netherlands, one of the popular food delivery websites ( accepts bitcoin! 
@_date: 2016-06-03 01:40:41
Make that $10
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:09:25
Haha, you can edit posts!
@_date: 2016-11-12 13:26:36
@_date: 2015-07-22 06:10:41
Well, most of them here are developing for web. So nope. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 06:11:10
Mac &gt; Windows &gt; Linux nowadays. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:14:51
Oh, I see your comment was directed to Linux. I agree that Linux is a bit crappy for consumer, but far better than Windows.
On Mac: Photoshop is available. Office is available. What emulators do you mean? I've ran Dolphin and PS2 and GBA. I also game a lot on my mac, using steam.
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:40:33
The experience is bad because you're used to bad experiences. First-time users learn OSX much faster than Windows. Developers love mac for a reason. The startup I work at (which is located in a huge building full of junior and senior developers) all use mac. If you can't understand OS X, there's **probably** something wrong with you. No offense. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 05:57:44
Saying this in 2015 only makes you look like an idiot, because it's not true anymore. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 06:00:16
You: no! I want my security vulnerabilities, even if that means I need to use a crappy OS!
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:04:00
Never even heard about it.
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:02:31
Ninja:  now that I think about it, that probably exists. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:49:32
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:10:03
Hey, lemme try too!
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:40:41
Almost 14 million, you mean?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:53:51
Very possible. I'll buy loads of coins then.
@_date: 2013-08-29 09:38:21
No problem. Sounded too good to be true for me, too. People still buy these, but for different reasons: securing the blockchain, for example. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:56:33
Whoo! Thank you! 
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:59:26
Not the GPS alone, no. You could use the M8 coprocessor on the iPhone for example. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:06:18
It's also only on the left channel.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:32:10
Ah, PHP. I have a love-hate relationship with PHP, it gets the job done. Coding is fun, you should try C Similar to Java, it's what I started with.
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:48:03
How does that work, actually? Do you get a bonus of some sort? Congrats either way! 
@_date: 2013-09-15 19:28:58


@_date: 2013-08-27 11:25:38
Suck a cock :)
@_date: 2013-09-10 11:31:28
Just wanted to say that. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:02:11
Months at 50mH/s for 0.01? No way. 2-3 days at the moment. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:39:38
Happening now.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:57:35
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:39:31
Wow, are you Pete Yorn? Huge fan here! How *awesome* was it performing with Scarlett Johansson, if you don't mind me asking? Haha, sorry, I'm excited, so many questions!
^^Also, ^^sorry ^^if ^^you're ^^not ^^him...
@_date: 2013-08-29 09:13:13
A long long time also known as never. Not literally, but it's like you buy a money printer that costs 25000$ and prints 5$ a day. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 13:05:33
Yes. I wanna live that life. I really, really do. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:26:34
What about the eBay app? Hm?
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:17:16
It's on Cydia. They can't remove it there.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:21:48
Heh, that's funny! Fellow coder, I see. What do you code in now, if you still code?
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:21:03
There will be bitcointips in your near future. Sadly, for me, labcoin :(
@_date: 2013-06-26 21:59:52
Could someone explain/link me how this works? Dividends, what?
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:08:44
Well, change it! That's the idea of wikipedia. Just add what you think should be there.
@_date: 2013-08-29 09:11:41
Yeah! And every winner could get a symbolic price of a satoshi? I don't know, could be cool!
@_date: 2013-09-17 05:39:18
I actually think it could be a way of future-proofing Dropbox, assuming Bitcoin gets another boom. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:01:55
Woh! Yes please! My miner name is bit
Yes, really. Haha. 
Sad that people downvote others
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:55:57
Read the top comment. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:33:32
Well, apparently somebody bought it and is now reselling it. I wouldn't dare to pay any kind of money for it, but if you're interested: [
Found on hackforums.net, so probably fake
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:15:58
Yeah! No.
Seriously, do we need another Apple vs Android? I fucking hate that, it's SO fucking old. Stop it.
@_date: 2013-08-29 09:38:55
Yeah, me too! Annual BitcoinAwards in vegas!
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:59:47
Oh man, that sucks. I always thought that Reddit existed in a no-touching-ever environment (except for illegal stuff). Sad that you won't get your account back. This is my second account as well, the other one got harassed by Android fanboys everywhere I went (I hope I won't regret saying that). Anyways, sorry for harassing you, it was nice to hear your story.
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:22:49
Download the jailbreak version, it has everything. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:11:27
50BTC down here too (Netherlands). Was checking /new in hope for some post, so here I am.
@_date: 2013-06-27 00:09:37
Where can I buy these shares? I'm interested now.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:47:39
You can, yes. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:02:37
That video is way too low quality to see what's going on.
EDIT: also, I'd like to have more and clear information about how much each lose will cost me etc.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:58:17
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:48:21
That's $3000.
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:17:35
It's on Cydia. The full version.
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:19:00
Well, sure. But the people who use bitcoin are already a lot geekier than the average person, so it shouldn't be a problem.... Yet. Let's just wait 'til iOS 7, looks very promising when talking about open-ness.
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:33:32
That's what I wanted to hear. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:45:06
Very well, thank you. How about you?
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:56:02
Well, sorry mr high and mighty.
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:43:08
I just wanted to say that, there are a LOT of businesses enabling bitcoin lately! Awesome. Really, really awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:29:50
Let witcoins burn! Haha! Awesome car man, I hope you'll have lots of fun with it! :)
I'm still driving in my (t)rusty old fiat seicento.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:47:24
Awesome! Whoo! Thanks :D
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:12:30
Hah, all these tippers! If I knew it was this easy I'd have made a topic like this myself!
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:57:39
That's awesome! Could you explain if we can trust this?
@_date: 2013-07-03 11:19:17
Heh. You will probably see this a lot. People just try it. I think I'll take a bet soon, as I'll be technically betting .01 btc. When will this giveaway end?
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:18:44
Probably a scam.
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:56:57
Because he doesn't deserve it. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:39:26
Looking good! Awesome!
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:39:21
Well, that's retarded. Maybe because of scams an the like?
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:50:45
That's because it's zoomed out. There's a lot more data actually but it can only show the one datapoint at a certain point in time. It's kinda hard to explain as I'm on my phone but yeah. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:21:12
It's already been on there for a long long time.
