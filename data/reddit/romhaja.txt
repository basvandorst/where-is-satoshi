If you have a ledger you can download electrum set it up with your ledger and RPF (replace by fee) your latest transaction with higher fee that will also cover the older transaction CPFC (Child pays for parent). That way a miner will have to include the first low fee transaction if he want the high fee. But you need to increase the fee so it would cover both at least.

I hope I'll be around when he comes back... Probably not :/
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:46
Hearing these stories really eats me from inside. Its good that you cashed out most of it, I don't think any sane person needs to have that amount in bitcoin (unless its nothing for him).
Good luck for you and your family I hope you'll use it well.

IF ITS NOT ANOTHER PRICE MEME I DOWNVOTE!!!! ^^^/s

If you control the private key in your bch/btc wallet you can just look what the key is and import it to the other wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:22:56
I [this]( picture it says to buy when it goes down but then you said the second best time to buy is now. 
What should I do? haha

Anyone care to explain how does gdax has no miner fees? Are they just "on the house" or do they have an agreement with a certain mining pool or something like that?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:59:15
I think a lot of people heard of Bitcoin already so uninformative ad would be useless
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:19:19
Stop calling every concern about the fees fud. Sure in days like this your transaction will be confirmed with barely any fees but that's not normal anymore, especially if we need to make a post about it every time... 
Btw I don't support increasing the block size as a solution, but it's not hard to figure out that what we have now is not right.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:28:35
He changed and will change lives. I hope he's still out there, watching from the sidelines, and I hope that we'll never know his identity.

I don't know if it's a pump or just side effect from 2x cancellation because a lot of people that believed in it had Bitcoin that they now convert to bch.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:42:37
If people want to buy bitcoins without doing any research its really bad on their part... There's nothing we can do.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:11:40
How can you buy X2 before it forked? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:04:22
I don't wanna sound like a douche but do more research next time before you buy something with this value. And yes you can hold multiple types of cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:31:25
So you were actively trading these not just holding there right? Hope your situation gets resolved fast.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:50:00
There's no best atm, there are ups and downs in both but what made me finally order a ledger is bigger support for alts. Search google and you'll find what suits you most.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:40:54
Great news! now coinbase and others!
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:24:13
But the market dominance is 45%, the highest it's been for 3 months.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:45:04
Question is to buy now or will it fall even harder?
Last time I asked myself that I didn't buy the 3.6K dip :/
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:27:24
Most of the readers just hodl so I think the influence of fake news is low here.

1btc = 100m satoshis so 1m satoshis = 0.01 btc

Luckily I'll never fork bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-18 15:48:00
Buy hardware wallet- Trezor or ledger. If you need some money you can sell some but bitcoin is only going up. And maybe get your uncle to look for the missing coins with you maybe he had split them or something.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:30:13

Satoshi coming out will make him a target for a lot of things. There's no reason for him to ever come out and expose himself. Everyone who claims to be him is 99% fraud.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:46:55
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:09:14
I think he doesn't thats why the cocain is still on his face.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:28:54
You didn't lose it, just wait some time. The mempool was pretty full this week.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:14:10


Giving one of the reason to its success as an argument. LOL.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:31:21
I already think its a bigger idea than Amazon or Apple. 
Whether it will be more "successful" (can't actually compare) or not.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:13:08
Just like Satoshis Genesis block the founders are probably going to be the ones who mine the first blocks I don't find that as a problem unless it's like btcg.
And I would add GPU only mining.

Thing is, bitcoin was supposed to be everyone's coin and now it feels like we don't have a say in some things...
Although I do understand that there's no way POW change will happen at this stage.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:26:55
I hope someone else calls it a fraud. I have more money ready to invest.

@_date: 2017-09-03 17:38:23
Coin base is one of the best places to buy bitcoin afaik (not the best value but the easiest imo- best value is a site you have to wait at least a month to get accepted) but coinbase stores your keys for you (your actual bitcoin) so after you buy from them you want to store it in your own wallet because some sites have been hacked in the past.
I'm pretty new with bitcoin myself but I've seen Electrum being the most recommended wallet in this sub, using it too! Be sure to save the seed. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:30:54
It goes up we buy it goes down we buy.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:41:12
You shouldn't do that kind of stuff. Just don't buy from them if you don't agree with them, don't go and leave a bad rating without any reason other than disagreeing with their decision.
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:36:17
I think who said that was pretty drunk atm.
This is based of the fact that trezor is ~~public~~ ~~shared source~~ open source and ledger isn't. Pretty similar to how Android is open source and IOS isn't. ~~but with Android developers can actually use parts of the code and with trezor they can only look at it.~~

Survey where everyone who answered is from @_date: 2017-10-20 16:36:19
It depends on how many transactions there are in the mempool, earlier today 10 satoshis per byte would've been enough. Last week mempool was weird maybe its x2 supporters trying to prove its needed or maybe just because the insane growth.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:41:34
