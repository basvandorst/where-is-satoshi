Would really appreciate a warrant canary. 
It's one thing to say you will never do anything bad with customer data but its another for the powers that be to take it and shut you up about it

Instead of generating x address, why not just generate a new address for every payment/transfer. That's the ideal for security, and less complicated for user (opposed to then figuring out how many they need).
Please add ability to combine payments into single transactions to reduce transaction fees. This could double as a 'Delayed Payment' option which people would see as a privacy tool (Anonymise time zone).

I second this. This is something that needs much more exposure. In addition to tipping it would also decrease transaction fees, and make auditing easier as you can lump similar (or not) payments together. 
I'd love an app that has a 'delayed payment' option where you can rack up a bunch of payments and then click 'Pay All' and/or automatically on the hour it sends through all your payments in one transaction.

Please don't let it turn into where the moderator is the board centralised controlling entity

Why do I have to log in to read a news article? That's ridiculous. 
Here's a link to a real [news site](

Theymos is the biggest I inhibitor to the core principals of bitcoin by advocating for them in the way that he does. I hope he can see how ironic his position is

All the voting is showing is that it is you who need to better explain your view. The masses have voted and you can't argue a better position, why does that mean the masses are wrong?

This is an amazing thing you are doing. You should be really proud. Keep up the good work

Either way, it didn't work. So we can cross one of those two options off the list

For those looking 'The Stock Tip' is season 1 episode 5. And is pretty easy to find with Google

What happened? Why did they even buy? My parents are tech savvy but they wouldn't see the point of it

Do you know which wallet apps support this? I imagine the Android app doesn't support. Seems like another thing to code that would see very little benefit from your average user.

I'm saying that there are more people using torrents than bitcoin. They are throwing people in jail for torrenting. And yet governments that have been introducing anti-peer-to-peer laws are still in power. So I don't think your democracy argument would apply to bitcoin, which again, has less people power associated with it than torrents does.

Can't ship overseas? :(
edit: And can't buy with BTC??? This is a really cool idea, but I feel a bit let down
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:50:10
So when do we buy??
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:49:03
This is terrible logic. I'm sure there are more people using peer-to-peer systems, and that's all but illegal these days.
