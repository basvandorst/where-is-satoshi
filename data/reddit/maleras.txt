That is the case in any industry and even in this one. Look at Tron and Eos with their SR's. 21 people essentially having power over the entire network. In the end someone has to have authority over things.

Technically if you keep your coins on an exchange you don't "own" your coins. Therefore no property has been lost and no true legal action can be taken. The exchange owns your coins. They don't operate as banks in this fashion. If you want to truly own your coins the only way is to transfer to a wallet. Preferably a cold storage wallet. 
That being said, if the exchange is reputable and wants to continue doing business, it will work on either getting the coins back or compensating those for what they lost.
TLDR; You don't own your coins unless they're stored in a wallet.

Paper dollars are "worthless" by your definition as well. Gold is "worthless" and everything else is "worthless". Worth is determined by what someone is willing to pay for it. Not what a government or any other person says or tries to impose. Your so called "valuable" paper money is backed "by the full faith of the united states government". Not by gold or any tangible "precious" metal. Therefore it is just as "worthless". Bitcoin is backed by a definable ledger and marketplace with supply and demand. Much more than just 'faith".

But look up Coinbase's rules. If you keep your coins with them, they technically own the coins. They're stored offline and the access to them is split between several persons across the world who all have to form a consensus to move them.

Yea you can try anything. Sure. Maybe i phrased it wrong when i said true legal action. More like Winnable. My bad.
