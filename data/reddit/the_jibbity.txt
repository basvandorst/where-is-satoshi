Isn’t devaluing the dollar the same as inflation? Print more dollars, purchasing power goes down?

The only Bitcoin available is the bitcoin people are willing to sell. If no one is selling it there is none to buy. When some is mined in the next block it is only available if the miner will sell it. All of it is possessed by someone. An exchange is just a place where people have agreed to sell it it at a given price.

Technically what you are asking is possible. But as motor-boat said that would imply the price of a bitcoin is infinite. If no one would sell it there is absolutely none to buy. You would have to mine it.
If your curious how you could place a buy order and not have it be filled, go place a buy order for $100. It will not be filled. 
How exchanges would deal with this? Who knows, it is too abstract of a scenario ( not practically possible). But the price on the exchange is based on what people are willing to sell it for. If no one is willing to sell, it is priceless until someone changes their mind. Or someone new mines some they are willing to sell, then they would set the price.

Your good, sometimes it helps to think through things in the most extreme cases and then work backwards. 
Before it got to the point of no one willing to sell it, you’d have to ask how are miners affording the electricity and costs to mine it? Certainly they would have to recoup their costs by selling some or paying for electricity in Bitcoin. That transaction alone would set a price.  At the end of the day it’s not valuable to hold, people hodl now because they are speculating that it will be worth a lot as a medium of exchange in the future, but everybody’s got a price... or at least some person always will.

At least, I hear, the median IQ has been quite stable

GBTC is an option for you, roll your old 401 into an IRA and buy GBTC. It is a fund designed to track the price of Bitcoin. I’d rather have money in Bitcoin but this is a good option... I looked into Bitcoin IRA but it was a bit convoluted
