They absolutely are though, government share of the economy is still extremely high.

Look at how many of China's [industries are government controlled]( 
Also, you can't beat a country that literally refuses to allow its citizens access to the outside internet for 'control freaks'.

Current monetary policies have stabilised the economy. (I've linked this in other replies, but here in Australia the RBA has [showed very clearly]( how well monetary policy performs. We don't use the same policy as in the post-war period, and the fact you didn't know that policy has switched from pure supply targeting to inflation targeting means you really don't know much about monetary policy. 
[Also, the USA's M3 is actually shrinking at an annual rate post QE](

Think what proportion of people are employed, directly or indirectly, by what you would consider 'consumerist' or 'nonessential' industries. It's a lot of them. I'm obviously not advocating unlimited spending beyond your means, but everybody spending money is what keeps everybody employed. 
Japan's central bank also fucked up majorly, and they're at the ZLB (zero lower bound of inflation, where inflation becomes deflation and the economy collapses into a clusterfuck). 
If you're a bank, for example, why would you loan money to someone when the negative interest rate means you'd gain more money literally just holding onto your cash.

Because monetary policy, [by definition]( requires power over the money supply in order to stabilize the economy through the price mechanism. Since there is no central power in bitcoin with the ability to manipulate supply, this is not possible. This is why a purely bitcoin-based economy would be a bad idea as we would return to a time where the economic cycle was much more volatile (depressions were longer and worse).

Inflation doesn't lower real wages provided that the inflation (such as, here in Australia is set by the central bank ahead of time and publicly announced so as to avoid giving unfair advantages to certain industries) doesn't outgrow real GDP growth. 
As for your concerns about outlawing alternative currencies, bitcoins aren't illegal and probably will never be (unless you live in china) but let's be realistic here, the majority of owners of bitcoin treat it as an investment good and not as a currency. You do not want this quality in a currency because it produces a distortionary bias towards not spending money above the natural cost-benefit analysis you would conduct when making an economic decision

I see what you mean, it's easy to misunderstand what this inflation represents. In order for consumers to be 'robbed', inflation would need to rise higher than wages (i.e. 'real' wages (wages - inflation) would need to decrease while real prices (prices adjusted for inflation) would need to increase. However, in a country with a growing economy (that is, where its ability to produce goods and services is constantly growing), increased demand for goods naturally increases prices, while increased demand for labour drives up wages - the two go hand in hand. This increase in prices is measured as (small) positive inflation - too much would be bad, and this increased wages is measured as increased income per person. 
Hope i helped clear things up - sorry if I've come across as condescending, there are some very rude commenters in this chain.

Personally, no, you would not be poorer immediately. With deflation, your $100 a week grocery bill could now maybe buy an extra meal. 
However, say you want to take out a loan to be able to buy a house - why would a bank lend to you when they can also just hold onto the money they have, and it will become more valuable over time? Thus nobody offers loans, people cannot loan money to start businesses, expand, purchase goods beyond their current means (cars, houses, etc), and the entire economy is crippled as businesses are forced to close down. 
After you lose your employment due to the cascade of business failures, it won't matter that your previous paycheck was able to buy you more groceries.

Small positive inflation is the best for maintaining consistent economic growth, and it can be seen that since inflation-targeting monetary policy was implemented here in Australia, the inflation has become significantly less volatile.
edit: just though i'd add, high inflation is bad because it means real wages drop because items cost more than the corresponding increase in pay, and deflation (such as that which cryptocurrencies provide) have no mechanism to adjust supply to meet a demand target.

The SGS estimate is an independent estimate of the money supply which in the past has provided accurate estimates of the true M3 even though it's not a Fed-linked organisation. 
Considering you seem to distrust the Fed anyway, would you trust an independent analysis more or less than the official statistics? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:07:39
Yes, inflation targeting has absolutely stabilised inflation. 
[Here in Australia]( our central bank has kept inflation consistently within its target of +2-3% per year, which has a huge positive effect on real economic variables. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:39:12
Real wages haven't been decreasing, they've been more or less constant. What is more concerning is the divergence of [real wages and productivity]( which is of concern for different reasons than monetary policy. 
Bear in mind, this graph is just that, real wages (wages after inflation). Meaning that the above relationship between increasing wages and increasing prices has held true, and that (most)* goods haven't become more expensive than people have been able to afford. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 09:09:02
Yes, but in those cases power is being ceded to a country with superior ability to conduct monetary policy, which by definition stabilizes currencies and economies and is impossible with a deflationary cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.

Do you mean in terms of automation? 
Either way, it's better for everyone to be richer (before robots steal all our jobs anyway) than poorer, isn't it?

They do, but this isn't the price fall that you want (i.e. one caused, for example, by a decrease in production costs or an improvement in production technology) but rather a state in which it is economically viable to hold money (as money gains value (deflates) annually) - which absolutely crushes economies as there is now an incentive not to spend your money (when you should be spending). See, for example, Japan during the Lost Decade (and to a lesser extent, the present day.

You don't have to be experiencing negative inflation for a currency to be deflationary, just less than the corresponding economic growth (i.e. when real gdp growth is more than inflation). Bitcoin has been deflationary for a very long time which is why its value has increased so dramatically (plus the majority of users treating it like an investment good and not what it should be, which is a currency).

Does this take into account hours worked? Amount of people in the work force? 
Wages per week is not a very comprehensive figure

Gold was not stable. The price of gold was stable. The economy, under a gold standard, was horrendously volatile which harmed economic progress as the economy would experience long booms and long depressions.

Inflation targeting has (here in Australia) [led to consistent inflation within the target range.]( Monetary expansion only creates problematic inflation if there is no corresponding increase in production capacity to support it (see: Zimbabwe).
