Doing a lineage os install without all of the gapps bloat has made a world of difference in my phones performance and longevity " nexus 5" but the original plan was to avoid all of the invasive popups and new programs that I had no interest in and could not remove.

I am so excited for this wallet to get to F-droid!

Hey I see you are at best buy. Would you like to let others know about your shopping experience?  
Lineage is great but you have to expect a few tradeoffs. I use signal for my chat and text and was able to get an apk for it but proton mail took a little more work and does not send notifications due to using gapps tools for that function. I can still log into gmail and YouTube through the browser when needed but that still begs the notification issue. Tried setting up k9mail for gmail but had to lower security to much. Was able to find official apk's " or alternative " for the rest of the apps I use. So ya I think this works!
