I would recommend not having your coins on an exchange.  There is a saying that if you don't hold the private keys, you do not really own the coins.
Instead, I would recommend any app that uses an HD wallet (where you write down and store a 12-word phrase).
This can be memorized and then you and only you have access to your coins, and you can get them back using any app or tool that supports HD wallets.

I have not mined in years, but back in the day there were charts and forums full of people posting the hash rates they were getting for every piece of hardware imaginable and their settings, those things still have to exist.
Asking about mining in the Bitcoin space is now talking to larger players who have some edge in the game with cooling costs, access to hardware, cheap electricity, or some combination of all three.

Roger was the original bitcoin evangelist.  He would give the talks, go in the shows... and everyone loved him.  He ran a website where people could buy stuff for bitcoin, one of the first.  The issue was his past... he got into trouble with the law.
He is also a Hardcore Libertarian, more then most I would say.  And he refused to accept middle ground or compromised positions.  Then later he stood up for Mt.Gox lending his credibility to them when it turns out they were in free fall.
During that same time, Andreas came on the scene, much more measured in his approach with a strong motive towards keeping people secure.  Andreas is a good speaker and dedicated himself to answering questions and being a good public face for bitcoin, meanwhile, Roger started focusing on the business side of things moving himself to Panama if I remember.
That was the story for the longest time, no direct conflict, just kind of an unofficial passing of the bitcoin evangelist torch.
Then Roger poor shamed Andreas because Andreas spent down his bitcoin holdings over the last 3 or so slow years.

If you calculate your mining profit using a GPU on bitcoin vs. the cost of electricity, you should be losing money.  I have a USB Stick miner from years ago that pulls 330MH/s at 5 watts I believe, and even that is not profitable to run anymore on bitcoin.

Even if it did "Crash" to $3,000 that would still mean bitcoin is WAY up for the year.  Do you realize that?  This date one year ago the price was $772.  That's a MASSIVE gain for the year.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:02:01
Anyone who thinks the price is going to go up would buy bitcoin.
Anyone who has bitcoin who thinks it is going down will sell.
The market then arrives at a price balance of what people think the price is considering all known information.  That is how market prices work.
The price should already reflect what the market thinks will happen, but then again... this is a big change so who knows.
My feeling is futures will allow some data center gurus who know their shit but are risk averse to buy some futures, and then build out mining with reduced risk.  These people will be countered by people who do not understand bitcoin or think it will fail to be willing to buy the other side of those futures.

Probably the wrong subreddit to ask this on, but why is Litecoin still a thing?
Their argument of "silver to gold" always seemed shallow to me I mean, bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, you don't need a lesser valued unit.
Then after that argument failed they said "oh our hashing algorithm is better!  No Asics!" then that died when Scrypt Asics came out.
Now what is it?!  Why is anyone still in Litecoin?  It was and is Bitcoin with a few numbers tweaked here and there with the smaller user base and lower adoption.  WHY!
Is there something I am missing?  What Utility does Litecoin have that has let it live on in bitcoins shadow?  Why wasn't it abandoned?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:31:18

Are you also the recipient of the bitcoin (sending to yourself?) or who is it that is receiving the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:13:02
They are, but that just means each confirmation is worth less.  The security of a crypto transaction is directly proportional to the amount of computing power it is buried under in the blockchain.  No one, to my knowledge, quite knows shy satoshi chose 10 min block times, but the shorter you make the block time the less each block is worth for security.
Further as bitcoin expands and we use satellite networks and rural wifi, orphan blocks become more of an issue the shorter your block time is.
So while it is true they are "4x faster" it's not clear that they are really better for doing it that way, although people do bias that first confirmation more then they should technically.

My best advice in that regard is to ignore the price and buy a small amount at a regular interval.  This is called dollar cost averaging.

I mean, it depends on how you look at it.  Im my view the world needs a global currency, and bitcoin is it.  I see bitcoin taking over all other currencies in the long term, including other cryptocurrencies.
If there is no utility to Litecoin, and it has no future, people investing now are just throwing away their money.

This is the right answer.  Sometimes I wonder if Satoshi may still be around, and contacting finance ministors offering a bounty to adopt bitcoin as their currency, and a reward of X amount of bitcoin to help them bootstrap.
Either way, once one small African nation adopts bitcoin, the torrent of small nations running to get on will cause a sugre that makes this last year look like nothing.

What wallet are you sending to?  Is it nano to nano?  Where is the private key stored?  Its possible you could do a Child Pays for Parent.  You spend an Unconfirmed UTXO with a high fee, and the miner sees that if they accept both the unconfirmed transaction and the new one, they will get a good fee and commit both to the block.

The main factors you would have to consider is how many times in what period of time each bitcoin would be traded... my assumption would be that each bitcoin on average would move once a day.  Some would actually move many times more then that, some many times less... but Im just picking 24 hours because you have to pick some number.
Lets also pick how many bitcoins are "alive"  I am going to pick 10,000,000 because it is a nice number, and we know lots of coins are lost or just simply will never move... 
Then we need to figure out how much money moves around in a day... It appears that 120billion dollars moves per day ... (44 trillion in trade per year)
Each coin would then need to be worth 12,000 just to support transactions.  Each coin would actually need to be worth far more then that, to account of peoples savings and what not... but I came up with a number just because, and I will not stand by this number whatsoever because I did the bare minimum of work to come up with it, I would love to see someone put more effort in and figure out an answer.

They do not "nail" you with limits... the limits are necessary to the game.
If you had no limit, and you happened to have more money then the casino by a decent margin.  You could EASILY steal all their money.
Say a small casino has a 1,000 to their name, and you have 1,000,000.  You walk in, they have no "limit" to the betting, so you bet 1,000 dollars at 49.5% chance to win.  If you win!  They are broke... if not... keep betting, but double up!
Bet 2,000 at 49.5%  again, you win, they are broke... if not repeat.  
Because you have so much more money, you can get the probability that you win to the point where it is almost a SURE THING that you will take all of their money.
They "nail" you with the odds of the game, they control variance on the game by setting a min and max bet.

By importing them into your desktop wallet, you are destroying any security they had as paper wallets... and you may as well not print them in the first place.
As far as importing them in bulk, there really... should not be a way to do this.  You should have to scan each code individually, and the scanning will take you more time then the importing.  If you are going to have the private keys in a file easy for importing, you are again... ruining the security of the paper wallets and you may as well not print them.

If there is something that for sure will kill bitcoin, it is probably something we have not heard of yet, which is why we are not yet talking about it.

Ask for a wallet recommendation, and the two most popular you will get are probably a Mycellium wallet, or blockchain.info, both are SPV.  Rarely will you see people recommend bitcoin core, the only time I ever see it recommended it when people want to get more involved and start a node.  Find me one post, anywhere on reddit... where some new user was told they should build a blockchain.dat file from their copy of blockchain data hosted locally.

With gold, it is harder to represent smaller values due to the value of gold... trading in gold dust is not practical, so silver has a use alongside gold.
Bitcoin can be divided up to 8 decimal places now, and could be divided up further if needed... and a system like petty coin could be put in place to trade even smaller amounts....  Since bitcoin is digital, and not physical, what space is there for litecoin to fill?
Bitcoin units to big for you?  Switch to using mBTC or uBTC or satoshies....  
The gold and silver analogy only works for physical things, digital things have no such limitations.

There should be NO action taken until guilt is determined.  When you act on accusations, you hurt the defendant in every possible way, and make a successful defense less likely.
So many small internet business are killed this way, an accusation is made, the service is suspended... and in the multiple YEARS it takes to get the legal stuff resolved, your market has evaporated, or evolved past you... and all your investments are now losses.

Every 2016 blocks (every 2 weeks) the network re-targets the difficulty so that on average we find a block every 10 min.  Right now more and more hashing power is getting added to the network, so the difficulty goes up. There have been several times in history the hashing rate has gone down, and thus the difficulty went down.

State lotteries in the US take ~40% of the amount wagered and then uses the rest for payouts... they target the poor and uneducated, and use it to finance stupid projects they could not get other funding for.
Doog, and Just dice on the other hand, take 1% of the amount wagered, with Doog earning 0.1% of that, and the other 0.9% going to those supplying the house bankroll.
If you want to be angry about betting losses, you are misplacing your anger.  Not only that, but doog always tells people they should not bet, and did so in this case as well.

This article is bringing up old issues that I think have been addressed almost completely.  If bitcoin is fine, bitcoin will be fine.  If the numbers in mining need to be tweaked, not only could they be... but there are plenty of altcoins that are already experimenting with different values.
Is mining as a whole the problem? there are coins exploring this issue.
The author of the article also does not know much about bitcoin if they claim that there have been "no major fixes" to bitcoin.  I think satoshi is just as awesome as the next bitcoiner, but the original codebase had GAPING security holes in it that required massive fixes and some even resulted in hardforks.

Yes, it is possible with the protocol If I recall from a talk given by Mike Hearn on contracts in bitcoin.  However it is not yet implemented in any wallet that I am aware of.

I'm in the camp that does not believe issues like this can be summed up by two positions.  Any time I am presented with an issue, and two sides to choose from, I often find that on further thought I fit into neither.
Should we try to work with them? Probably not... what good would that do, they seem to have not taken any of the previous public comment to heart.
Should we ignore them?  Probably not... they have guns and jails and are located in the financial center of the US, and we do want mass adoption right?
Seems to me like neither of the two options are viable, and further thought is required.

Forcing all capital to find investment to protect it from inflationary loss is probably the biggest driving force that lead to the 2008 financial collapse from my grasp on economics.  There will always be more money then there is investment opportunities... since when you invest you in essence create more capital through fractional reserve.  This causes money to always be looking for investments that don't exist, and that demand creating investments that really should not exist.
I am no economist, but bitcoin lead me to do a good amount of research and brought me to understand and agree with the libertarian viewpoint.

So from what I understand, this exchange works by having both sides of any trade put into an escrow an equal amount of value to what they intend to exchange.  That escrow by can only be a crypto asset by nature of the escrow basically just being locked, and not held by any arbitration party.
The issue then, is this exchange has no on or off ramps.  If you want to get some bitcoin, you need to already have bitcoin to risk in escrow to cover the transaction.  Likewise, you need to have some bitcoin to sell your bitcoin.
This market may have some utility, but without an on or off ramp, it lacks the key features that many people are looking for in an exchange.
Am I wrong about this?  If not, then put simply... this is not the decentralized exchange we are looking for when people say we need one.

Interesting but...


Darkcoin may be different from bitcoin in this respect but in general for crypto currencies... the coins do not disappear when you have fork issues..  The coins are always ALWAYS somewhere, they just may not be where you want them to be.  If you sent coins and fork 1 recognizes you sent those coins, but fork 2 does not recognize you sent coins... and fork 2 ends up being the real fork... you basically get your money back.
I imagine that with some form of mixing, the coins could get locked up in an address no one has access to, but the coins should still be somewhere... just not available.

There is no set price for bitcoin, the value of a bitcoin is what people will pay for it.  Different methods and services for getting bitcoin have different level of ease of getting money in and out of the service.
The reason the price does not equalize from arbitrage, is that it takes several days to move fiat, and fiat can have large fees to move around.

Bitcoin is a global currency that ignores borders.  With bitcoin, you can send several million dollars anywhere in the world for fractions of a penny, and at no time can anyone stop you.  With traditional banking, not only would a similar transaction cost you some percentage of the total transferred, but it would take days to process... and depending on who you are sending the money to, they may never let it process.
Bitcoin is doing for money, what the internet did for communication.  People laughed when technologists claimed there would be a computer in every home, and today there is a computer in every pocket.

Double spending by the inclusion of a higher fee does not work with how most miners process transactions.  Default mining behavior follows Satoshi's first seen rule, which states that miners ignore a transaction that would double spend a transaction already in their mempool.
Sure a miner could profit a bit more by taking the higher fee, but doing so would hurt the bitcoin network as a whole and ultimately ruin their profits... not unlike a miner would earn more BTC if he controlled more of the network, but if they have too much they ruin the system and kill their investment.

I may have to do some research on NXT, but overall my eggs are still in the bitcoin basket due to simply the network effect.
Let me ask a few questions though.  If a entity with lots of coins can be blocked from their coins forging, by a group of entities with less coin then the larger single entity, doesn't this open you up to more problems then with a bitcoin system?
From what I am reading, every owner of any coin needs to be running the equivilent of a full node at nearly all times... that does not seam reasonable.
I will do some of my own research, I mostly discounted the whole thing when I heard Advertisements for it on LTB, the fact that someone is paying for time and LTB hasen't seen fit to even mention them in their regular programming...

My assumption would be a new mining farm in china that did not realize how shitty internet in china can be.  They could have a massive amount of hashing power and are solving blocks faster then other people, but when it is time to broadcast their block they are to slow to the majority of the network and they get orphaned.
This has been a problem for miners before, and VERY recently a lot of new chips just came off of the presses in China.

They probably weren't vulnerable in a practical sense.  The only way you could make money off this glitch is if you convinced a support staff member that they needed to re-send the BTC.
Coinbase sets a HIGH standard for their support staff, and I doubt any of them would fail to research the transaction enough to figure out what is going on, even if their software messed up, their support staff would have figured it out if someone tried it.
I encourage anyone who questions this to go take the test coinbase put up when they announced they were hiring.  If you make it that far, just wait for your interview with Olaf!

Not really like you say... the central entity does not assign coins to addresses, but to accounts.  They keep all the keys and do not worry about what keys hold how many coins, as long as all the coins they hold and all the coins they tell their customers they hold remain the same.  When a customer wants to spend some coin the just send some coin from any of the addresses they control, not a specific one reserved for that customer.

The whole idea behind bitcoin, and the cypherpunk movement in general... is that trust is not required.  We know bitcoin works because we can see it working, and we know there are no backdoors because we can see the code, and so can you.
Everything is public and in the open.  Where are satoshie's coins? Go look at them on the blockchain, they are in the same place they have been for 3 years.
Bitcoin enthusiasts are excited about bitcoin not because they trust it, but because they do not need to trust it, we can see everything for ourselves.

Venmo is centralized, and does not look like it actually moves the money faster at all, it just acts like it does... it still uses the traditional banking systems right?  5-7 business days bullshit.

No distributed exchange has yet, to any reasonable satisfaction, explained how to manage fiat, and how to on board new entrants.

Many of the videos simply fail to properly explain the current system of money.  To understand why bitcoin is so great, you have to understand why the current system is so bad.  If you have never gone through identity theft, or had a charge back, or delt with credit cards as a business... you may think everything is ok.  When I give presentations about bitcoin, typically the majority of my time is spent explaining current money.  I run into people every day who still think our current money is backed by gold.
The other thing that videos get into is explaining how bitcoin works, which I feel is slightly a mistake.  When you are talking about how to use the internet with some novice, you rarely try and explain packet switching or TCP/IP in general, but most all bitcoin videos get too far into explaining the blockchain or mining.  That kind of explanation should be left to a second video.  A short intro video should spark your interest to learn more, to explain what it does and why that is better, not necessarily how it does it.

@_date: 2014-07-06 01:20:41
What?  I have no clue what you are trying to say.
An exchange is only valuable if there are people exchanging.  You could have the best matching engine in the world, but unless you have orders who cares.  The proposed system in the OP apparently requires people to risk in escrow as much or more of an asset then they are exchanging.  Because of this, there is no on ramp to the exchange...  If you have to have a crypto asset to trade a crypto asset, how do you first get a crypto asset?
With no on ramp, there are no people exchanging.  With no exchanging, you could have the best technology in the world and it would not do a damn thing.

People have proposed alternatives... but they are not desirable if you ask me.  Some people change the hashing algorithm in an attempt to break up centralization, when you really think about it... long term it will have limited to no effect.  Mining power will centralize around cheep power, cool climate, and efficient data centers... no matter what hardware or algo you use.
Then there are people that want to change the proof system... systems like proof of stake are proposed.  I find proof of stake a horrible idea, sure you do not use up electricity, but you replace that with a system where the rich get richer by design, not only that... but you have NO recourse if someone starts building up to a 50% attack.

dogecoin was horribly implemented, it did nothing to innovate in the crypto space and just changed some numbers around.  Doge did some good in attracting people to the space, but it may have done more harm in driving away people.  People already view bitcoin as silly internet money, and when they see dogecoin their suspicions are confirmed.

@_date: 2014-06-22 10:29:06
You don't understand my point...  In your example the person USES his membership in the group to try to conduct the deal AND that is the intended usage of the group, so membership in the organisation SHOULD be called in to question.
Is there any evidence that the person in question from the OP used his "position" as a member of the foundation to build up trust?  I don't see any... it was just assumed on the part of OP.  Considering Mark was a board member... you would think people would have learned.
Does the foundation CLAIM that you should trust their membership?  I don't think so...  Does the foundation stand to make any claims or guarantees about their members?  I have not seen any...
THE ONLY thing you can glean from the fact that someone is a member of the foundation is that they donated money to said foundation.
The reason your other post was inconsistent is in one breath you claim there are no such things as groups, then in the next claim if a member of a group is a scammer, you should consider all members of that group scammers.  You cant claim something does not exist, and then talk about how to deal with it as if it does.

You must be slightly ignorant.  There are already several systems that color coins to add value.  Most notably...   Those systems have no "cat out of the bag" type issue as there is no way to force anyone to honor the coloring.  People are compelled to honor the coloring when it adds value, and would just ignore it if someone colored taint.

Have your processor convert to dollars and deposit instantly, right now the tax issues are not something a small business is going to want to tackle, i imagine soon the IRS will get with it, or be ignored.

If everyone uses bitcoin to transact... you wont need to "pay a premium" to buy them... you will already have them.  If in every day life you are spending them, surely you will also be receiving them? right?
People can get their start in bitcoin by working for it... many jobs now are free lance type work, steady jobs are rare.  I have hired many a designer/coder/grunt worker and paid them in bitcoin.
People will also avoid the 1% fee when coinbase has more competition... I believe Circle charges 0% dont they? and many exchanges offer .1% or less...
Hell, even then... the cost of a 1% fee is nothing when Newegg will give you $150 off a $500 purchase, or if gift gives you 3% off, or any other number of deals businesses offer to consumers because of the lower fees on their side.

Scanning QR codes works well for me, and soon we will have NFC enabled wallets.
Transferring funds using private key swapping would be horribly insecure, private keys are just that... private.  Also... the process of "sweeping" coins broadcasts a transaction to the network, which would eventually require confirmations.
The future is network monitoring to assess the risk of accepting 0 confirmation transactions... or outsourcing that risk to some company to do for you.

Because the bitcoin client is not built to handle the initial blockchain download well.  Currently it has to do each block in order, verify it, then get the next one.  In 0.9.0 I believe gavin said the client will do a headers first download, then go out and fetch block data so that will massively improve things.
Currently running a full node is not something everyone is going to want to be doing, and pulling a full torrent client into the refrence client does not seem like a good idea... so having this torrent for people who do want to run a full node, and do want to be able to pull down data faster, is useful.

The price per MH/s was what the market would bear.  Asicminer held an auction first to sell the first blades, and then after that posted and kept reducing prices till they sold out of product.  If the price per MH was "too high" it was only because there were enough people willing to pay that price.
I think the situation where a miner overestimates the return on his ASIC and loses money by paying too much, is far better then the situation where a miner loses their money by never even getting a miner in the first place.

Square updates their EXISTING app with a button that instead of asking for the input or swipe of a credit card, displays a QR code.  The small business changes NOTHING about what they do.  Money is converted and put into their bank account by square.
I was at a fair recently and many food vendors were using square, but the big issue was that they could not swipe cards, the card reeders got filthy or just did not work, so they had to input the numbers by hand (which costs a higher fee).  Even with things going well, you pay a 3% fee with square (from what I remember).  They could offer bitcoin at 1% and those small business may start ASKING people to pay with bitcoin.

Just found this a little late, I have been trying to get you to make a video for a while.
Many people agree that this is the best video on bitcoin so far that fits the "short" format.  
The positives of the video is that it establishes the system before bitcoin in some way, many people are ignorant of how money currently works, so knowledge of how bitcoin works is not impressive to them.  The other positives are the fast talking simple animation style which you know works very well.
The issue with that video is some lack of attention to detail, and the obvious sponsorship of a specific company we do not like.
What would set a video from you apart from the other videos is your attention to detail, your style, and your established audience.
It has been mentioned before that there is a bounty made for you to make a video on bitcoin to try and sweeten the pot.
If you have any specific questions, want some people to run a script by or anything... let me know.  If you asked, I am sure we could get you some time with some important figures if there is some information or opinion you lack.

We can never know the true hash rate of the network, we can only estimate it based on difficulty and number of blocks mined.
If the time span of data you look at is too small, the variance gets you and when we find 3 blocks in 10 min, or fail to find a block for a full hour. If you look at too large a timespan, you fail to see when big additions happen to the network because it all gets averaged out.
It is hard (impossible) to find a sweet spot.  What you are seeing could quite possibly just be variance.

Really it is not the problem you need to understand more... but the solution.
Digital currencies are just ledgers.  A record of who owns what.  That is simple to maintain when one person controls it, but problems arise when there are multiple copies of it being edited, specifically double spend issues.  The issue is, you can tell one node you sent money to X and another node you sent money to Y and only later on when those nodes try to reconcile would they notice the issue, after you already got your good or service.  How can you keep things together? yet be distributed and have everyone agree on what happened first?
This is where mining came in, whoever can solve a particular math problem first, is the node out of the whole network who we base which transaction came first off of for THAT segment of time.  So even if different nodes saw different transactions at different times, it only matters what the node that found the block thinks.
You can actually use several things to provide this "proof" you do not "need" it to be computing power... the reason computing power was chosen is it would be hard (impossible?) to fake.  Imagine if you could just spin up 1,000,000 virtual machines, or if you were a big company like IBM who has lots of IP's addressed to them, you could take over the system if you wanted to easily.
Now, the reason we worry about someone having the majority of the hashing power, is that they could basically lie about what activity they saw on the network... and shut things down.
Let me know if you still have questions...

No he is not... he has no reason to attract new investors.  In fact he would make more money if he lost some of the investors he has if you understood how the site works...
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:34:24
You are wrong.  Doouglus does not earn money from investors, he earns money from gamblers.  For every bet on average dooglus takes .1% of the amount wagered, and .9% goes to investors.  What investors do is supply the house bankroll as the backing for large bets.  Because of how the math works out, probability and Kelly Criterion and things like that... the house can safely risk 0.5% of the entire bankroll on each bet and be reasonably sure that no gambler on a lucky streak will break the bank, because as they win... the amount they win becomes less, and over time the house edge takes over.
Risking 0.5% on each bet means that currently the maximum anyone can win on a single roll is 231.56 BTC.  If there are more investors, JD could support larger max bets... if JD had less... the size of the bet it could support would be smaller.
Very few people exist that can reasonably play at that highest level, and even fewer are willing to play at that level.  We have not seen the full balance of the bankroll being risked in a long long time.  The only time it needs investment is if the size of the max bet is preventing people from betting how much they want to bet.  We have not seen a max profit bet in months.
If the site had half the amount invested, all investors would make double the profit... none of the bets in the last several months would have been made impossible... and dooglus would have gotten the same amount of BTC from commission, and more profit from his own coin risked on the site.
You, my friend, are the one who is confused.

Could be any number of things, slow block times... lack of fee attached to the payment etc.


The above situation could be the issue with any application, although BIP70 complaint merchant apps would probably have fewer issues, I am not sure which have the payment protocol features in them.


You own the private keys, that is why my suggestion was this app and not coinbase or bitpay where you do not own the keys.

Supply and demand.  As they try and buy up bitcoin, the remaining bitcoin becomes worth more and more.  Eventually as they buy up more the price gets so high that they can not afford to be able to purchase anymore.
Bitcoin would be much harder to corner then other assets because any small unit is just as useful as some larger unit (on the grand scheme of things).  The bitcoin system would work just fine if there was only ever 1 bitcoin, we would all just trade fractions of coins, fees would adjust... etc.

1) Your choice really... you could offer fiat returns or you could not take returns... or you could offer BTC returns at current market value based in fiat.  Not really a bitcoin question but more a customer service one.
2) Bitpay has a directory as well, even though you are using coinbase I THINK you can still get listed there.
3) Dont think that accepting bitcoin is a free lunch, and that you are ENTITLED to extra business, free marketing, and love from the bitcoin community.  Many of us are thankful, and will support you... but it turns south quick when instead of appreciation from the business, the community sees entitlement.

To truly grow bitcoin and increase its utility and therefore value, you cant just hord coins.  If you did so, the value would in a way be artificial.  Buy building businesses around bitcoin you make it more useful and grow the value of your coins.
We have an infinite number of bitcoins for the purposes of what you are saying in the way that we can divide the coins we have into smaller and smaller pieces.  Each smaller piece is just as useful as any larger piece (ignoring fees).  We can never run out of bitcoin, we will simply add more decimal points.
Also, there are a finite number of email and IP addresses by the way... more so with IP addresses.  I am sure there is a theoretical limit on e-mail addresses, but it is much larger.

Bitcoin mining is often the target of scorn as a waste of resources because mining does not do any "useful work". This concern was answered by Satoshi himself and most bitcoiners have no issue with it, however...
Many new coins and projects are trying to address this issue by removing mining all together, by using proof of stake minting system.  Several high profile people have weighed in on proof of stake but I have not seen your opinion on it.

That is not accurate, only a small fraction of coins are on exchanges.  When MtGox collapsed, they did not even have 1 million coins, and over 10million coins existed.  AND they accounted for 90% of all trade volume around the time.
Far less then 10% of coins are held by exchanges.
Then, lets compare to fiat.  Where only about 1.25 trillion dollars exist to represent value outside of a bank... and a portion of those are in banks.
Sure, bitcoin may not be what we all wanted it to be 4 years ago, but we are still way WAY better then the incumbent system.  At least we have the possibility of having our currency held by ourselves, there is not enough paper(cloth really) to print all the notes that would be needed to represent all the fiat.

I frankly do not care if you get into bitcoin or not, I am not trying to sell you anything.  To me bitcoin is a solution to many problems in the economy and the financial industry.  People evangelize bitcoin so much because it is hard to keep to yourself.  Imagine if you found a cure to cancer and all your friends were stuck in chemo... would you not try and tell them about it?
Bitcoin prevents seizures, it ends currency manipulation, it reduces transfer costs, it adds accountability to charities... at the cost of... having to learn good backup and password practices?  Other issues will be figured out later as things develop.
When was the internet created?  Look at this nice example of a website CREATED IN 1996  It took more then 10 years to go from nothing to get to that... and then compare that to now reddit!  Bitcoin is still early, there are layers on top of bitcoin yet to be built, and those layers will make things way simpler for the end user.

Bitpay already does this.  They have well connected nodes that watch the network.  The thing is, honest nodes take the first transaction they see, so once you see that your transaction is the only one... and that all major nodes and miners have your transaction... you are pretty safe.
So yes, you are right... this is the solution and people already do it.

Transactions are bundled into blocks, blocks happen ~every 10 min and the network difficulty adjusts to enforce this.  Blocks are limited in flie size.  If there are more transactions to be processed then can be fit, they are prioritized.  So there is currently a hard limit to protect against things getting too big.

I think what really killed them was their pegged accounts.  They were offering to deposit an amount and they would manage the fluctuations in bitcoin value for you.  I imagine they took lots of deposits the first few days, and then when the price crashed they got screwed over.
Putting on my tinfoil hat, maybe someone crashed the BTC market specifically to stop Neo &amp; Bee to give the traditional banking system more time to respond to the threat of Neo &amp; Bee, to me it seems they were poised to explode if things had stayed the course, or gotten better.

The comment people are stupid and bitcoin is hard to understand are not related in my head the way you are thinking.  I am saying people are simply stupid.  We are a horribly imperfect race in two independent but related ideas.  I am sure that most people could understand bitcoin on some level, but think of this example...
In cryptography, and in bitcoin large numbers is in part what provides the security.  There are a finite number of addresses, and this causes people to worry about generating a duplicate address.  What people fail to understand, and what I think EVERYONE intuitively fails to understand, is how large the numbers we are dealing with really are.  Our brains are stupid, we just cant handle things on that scale.
I am not insulting when I am using the word, I am just admitting fault.
The sooner you recognize the flaws and failures in the human brain, the sooner you can find ways to compensate for them...
The specific stupid human brain flaw that relates to the OP is our unit bias, which is why I am a proponent of using bits or satoshies to compensate for this.

While it is technically true that when you use an address once you make it a tiny bit less secure, the word tiny seems to fall short of explaining the impact.  The impact, from what I understand, would be like taking a image the size of the known universe, revealing one pixel, and then claiming you revealed something about the image as a whole.  While technically true, it is as close to no information so as to be worthy of ignoring.

No, my argument is that overall demand for storage from general consumers is on a downward trend as they store less of the media they consume.  And that institutional storage wont move over to a system like this till it is far more finalized.  These two things together will make Storj adoption slower then some people seem to be thinking.
Not only that... but when you are looking at the cost of your operation... what % of the cost is the storage?  I imagine electricity and bandwith costs are higher then the cost of storing data..

Although your math holds up, your logic does not.
If I want to buy a bitcoin for $600 dollars right now, not many people would take me up on that offer.  The current price of a bitcoin is more then that.
Now, for the price of a bitcoin to go from $600 (what it was a few days ago) to $640 today, did $480,000,000 have to enter the bitcoin economy?  No... 
Not every bitcoin is up for sale, several people like myself hold them long term.  The pool of bitcoins up for sale is small.  It takes a relatively small amount of capital to move the price of a bitcoin up $1 on the markets, it does not take $1 for every bitcoin in existence.
Therefore, it does not take 1 out of every 100 adults to put 65,000 into bitcoin for it to reach 10,000 a coin, in fact... it is entirely possible that with current demand for bitcoin the price could get that high, if people who hold bitcoin refused to sell.

I have started to make an argument that bitcoin in some way may solve environmental issues, not cause them as people fear from mining.

So first off, solar power has it's uses but using it as the major source of electricity generation is idiotic.  Nuclear power is the way to go, Pandora's Promise is a great documentary I found very informative on the topic.
Secondly, even if you were going to go with solar, which you shouldn't, there are a few basic things you would want to do to optimize your output.  Put them in a place where other objects are not going to shade the panels, put them on a stand to track the sun, put them in a place that is relatively clean to prevent buildup on the panel, put them in a place out of harms way where things are not going to break them.
Putting them in roads... is just bad.  Their location would prevent them from getting optimal sunlight, they would get covered in shit, to provide some level of grip, the glass would need some coating or texturing which would obscure light... I could go on and on.
Not only that... but we really should not even have the roads we have!  Having everyone have their own car that they drive down big open roads is horribly inefficient and takes up massive amounts of space.  The garages, the roads, the parking lots the DEATHS... having a transportation system involving hyper loops for long distance, light rail for cross city, and moving sidewalks for local short distance, would be far FAR more efficient.

I do mean 0 confirmations.  You can safely take 0 confirmation transactions by watching your transaction propagate through the network.  If you watch a good portion of the network, you could see a double spend attempt before it happens, and then hold that transaction.  Bitpay has a system like this to protect them.
Making the confirmations happen more often reduces the value of each confirmation as a measure of transaction security.

It is going to be hard, see impossible, to stop centralization long term.  Eventually as margins get small for home operators and the efficiency of data center cooling drive centralization.  Centralization can happen around sources of cheep electricity (look at the aluminum industry) or around being quickest to start hashing by being closest to the factories.
The thing people do not understand, is that sure, bitcoin may be controlled by a few large miners in the future, but those few competing miners are better then the current system of central banks.

There is a better way of doing this, simply be the verifier yourself.  The only thing it takes to be your own verifier is a well connected node, and most people are running or are connected to one of those anyway.  Since miners take older transactions, once you know every node you are connected to knows about your transaction, and has not told you about any double spends, you can be reasonably safe with 0 confirmations.
Mycelium wallet has a feature to be released in their next version that tracks propagation of your transaction through the network using their nodes.  With that you can see how secure your payment is.

FRB will fail with bitcoin.  Lets say you are a bitcoin bank... someone deposits 10 btc with you and those are your reserves.  You then issue credit, pay interest... all the good old FRB practices.  As this happens, your ratio of real btc to this credit btc will always widen.
Eventually someone wanting to move btc out of your bank system to another that does not respect your credit system (wants real btc) will withdraw what may be a small portion of BTC on your books, but could be a significant portion or all of your real BTC.
With fiat, you have the lender of last resort, the fed... that backs up the bank.  Since all of the money is fake, they can make more of it to cover deposits.  You cant make more BTC out of thin air.
Someone eventually loses in fractional reserve, with fiat everyone loses with inflation... with commodities like gold or BTC someone near the end of the life of the institution draws the short straw.

The cost to develop an ASIC is actually not as costly as many people think... YES IT IS EXPENSIVE but there are several companies that make asics that got their start with far less then 1,000,000 dollars to work with.
Asicminer is working to open source their PCB design, and may in the future open source their ASIC design.  Just as computers come down in price, ASIC miners reduce in price rapidly, sure a brand new miner is expensive, but if you have cheep electricity, buying a "used" miner and running it for the rest of it's life can be profitable.

The biggest issue seems to be most of the time the cashier needs to get approval from a CSS (Customer Support Supervisor) to take the gift cards.  I have used ECards from both Gyft and EGifter at walmart no less then 10 times, and I think 9 of those times a CSS had to be called over...
This leads to me holding up the line... with sales low, walmart (in my area) has low staffing... so even though walmart wants to get into e cards, the costs for them are higher then the benefits.
It may just be a training issue with Walmart, but even if it is only that... the training cost would be massive.
One thing my walmart wanted me to do was redeam the E card I buy for a physical card at customer service to make things go smother.
I have no inside information on this, just an educated guess based on personal experience.

After the first hearing, the price went from ~600 to ~900 and the senators even commented on the impact at the opening of the second hearing.
The overall impact was that several large businesses who were wary of US bitcoin involvement had their questions answered... overwhelmingly the senators acknowledged if regulation was too tight, innovation would leave the US and we would be left behind.  This led to many companies today to feel more comfortable with bitcoin.
Even the child protection guy was positive about bitcoin, and this was a HUGE surprise to everyone in the chat room when he spoke.

I could address all your points, but I will just focus on the big one.  Sure you give up consumer protections when you stop using a credit card, but honestly they charge far to much for their services, especially when you consider the additional hassle if some 3rd party loses your information and you have issues with identity fraud.
Credit cards charge ~3% and you get the ability to preform a charge back?  How valuable is that really?  Firstly with bitcoin you would eliminate the need for most chargebacks as they cant overcharge you, you choose what to send you are not handing someone the keys to your account and hoping for the best like you are with a credit card.
Other types of charge backs, like when you receive a faulty product or bad service, I rarely if ever experience these.  It would be cheaper for me to eat the cost of these events then pay 3% on every transaction I preform.

Because in the face of bitcoin, there is no reason for litecoin...  
Any problem with bitcoin will probably also be an issue for litecoin.  The "faster" confirmations just make each confirmation worth less in terms of security.  
Being "silver" to the gold of bitcoin is stupid, you can divide a bitcoin to 8 decimal places, the physical properties of gold give silver some utility as a smaller unit of trade, bitcoin has no such properties that limit it.
The crypto space would be less confusing if it were consolidated and people were not pushing for 100 other shitcoins.

I think this is the key.  Coinbase is a step in the right direction... the issue for coinbase once bitcoin is widely accepted and less volatile will be to validate their own existence.  Think of AOL, they got people to use the internet, but after that... people realized they did not need AOL and there were other options out there for far cheaper, and AOL all but died... but without AOL we would not be where we are with the internet today.

Found a new "best" bitcoin video, but again it is not perfect.
It is advertising for a pool that probably should not be advertised or supported at this point in time.  There are also a few lines that... are not good.  laszlo is still alive and well, it may be funny to some to say he hung himself... but come on.  There is still accountability when you do something with bitcoin.  The statement that they are mind from some super server may not be the best to put it... and a few others.  The one thing I mentioned in other post is that you need to go into the history of money it self a bit to explain bitcoin, this video did that better then any other short video I have seen.
But being fast talking simple animation really helped this video, if it was a little less biased and had better attention to detail, like the great CGP can do...

The issue is that it is not simply the number of confirmations that matters, but the amount of hashing power that number of confirmations your transaction is buried under represents.  If you just arbitrarily made bitcoin confirmations happen twice as often, it would be my understanding that they would simply provide half the security in knowing your transaction could not be reversed.

No... the point of bitcoin is to remove the need for trust.  If you chose to ignore it's intent and trusted your keys with someone else, that is your problem.

The reasons pools exist is to counter the variance inherent in mining.  You get the lowest variance by joining the largest pool.  I think the MAIN reason they have that much power, is because... they themselves have that much power, not miners pointing their miners to them, but people buying contracts from them and GHash running their own miners there.
There have been mining pools that had far more % before GHash.io... Slush, Deepbit, BTCGuild, all have had reasonably over 50% of the mining power in the past.. and we are still here.

Some clients will let you import, otherwise you can use the command line options in bitcoin core to just read out your private key and manually import it.
Most lite wallets will let you import private keys, at least mycellium does, and that is the one I use.

There are several ideologies in the community that are clashing...  Some people want bitcoin to be perfect, other people want bitcoin to be good enough to do what it needs to do.  Some people want to say fuck off to traditional payment systems, others want to work with them.
If you read the dev email list, you see lots of these battles of ideology, and because they cant/wont be resolved ever... less work gets done and more arguing is done.  Both sides want to push bitcoin to their worldview... and then there is the side that wants to keep bitcoin agnostic... but they end up falling to one side or another more often then not when it comes to specific issues.

Firstly, you are not "the" graduate student doing work with bitcoin, you are just one of many.
Secondly, if this is for graduate level study... is this really the way you are going about research?
To directly answer your question... on both counts... we don't know.  Everything is speculation, on both issues, information is hard to come by as both have gone into the legal system, and from that any good information stopped flowing out.
In general, Silk Road is a story of hiding from the law, yet leaving a trail of breadcrumbs, whilst being betrayed.  MtGox is a story of incompetence, which later rolled into a cover up and scandal.
I could give better detail, but doing so would be providing mostly speculation.  Reading some articles on Coindesk, and listening to a few episodes of Lets Talk Bitcoin would also do you some good.

This was in the run up to the Nov 18 senate hearing.  On November 16th the price was 470, on the 18th the price peaked up to 685.  Just up to that and then after the actual first hearing when it climbed to 900 there were several large buys that moved the price in large chunks (my exact claim may be a slight over estimate... but when you were there it sure felt like it.

This idea would not work, and if this idea would work... you would break bitcoin.  You submit a transaction to the entire network, and whoever solves the block gets to choose what transactions are included.  The person who makes the transaction has no ability to prevent one miner from including their transactions over another.
You could avoid broadcasting your transaction to the node of a miner you do not like, but other nodes would not respect your wishes...  If you convinced several nodes to not forward transactions to a node, you would be fragmenting the network, and overall just making bitcoin worse.
This is a bad, unworkable idea... but good try.
What you could do however, is directly send transactions to miners you like to reward them for being cool, like people have recently done with P2Pool.

Basically the liquid has a low boiling point, and boils off, then is condensed and drips back into container, so no part of the board can ever really get above the boiling point of the liquid.
The chips being used in this demo are the Asicminer BE 200 chips.  The general idea seems to be to but 6 tanks in a shipping container and have the whole thing wired up so you just power the container, and you have a crazy powerful bitcoin miner, all nice and self contained.

It was kind of a joke.  The best way to solve the problem is by making the node lightweight enough to the point where SPV goes away and everyone runs a full node for their hot wallet for their own security.

Wrong version... 
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:27:34
Firstly the concept of a cold lite wallet does not make sense.  A lite wallet is lite because it connects to some server for the blockchain.  Lite and full clients are both online, then there are just offline key storage systems that have no knowledge of the bitcoin blockchain directly, and need limited data from an online computer to figure out how to sign keys.
You are right in your thinking... but really anyone who has the private key IS the owner of the coins.  So, you could have 7 people all share one private key, and they all have full access to the coins.  The block chain does not keep track of who owns what private keys, it does not care, the block chain keeps a record of what public keys have what balance, and only lets you move coins if you can prove you have a corresponding private key to a public key.  Does that make sense?

I think the issue here has to do with flaws in the system.  If people were forced to vote on every item after critically evaluating it, I would have no valid issue.
The problem arises that memes are easier to evaluate, and therefore get more votes then harder to digest content.  If you only have 10 min before a meeting to brows reddit, you only really have time to look at images, that hour long video by Stefan Molyneux just sits there all alone even if he brings up new interesting ideas you never thought about.
I am guilty of this myself... Only once a day do I actually go through all the long form content on reddit, but every hour or so I check and vote on the smaller topics even though I realize this is damaging... I still do it.
This discussion on how reddit works comes up a lot, and most of the time the easy fix is just to ban memes, and have separate reddits for memes.

I have Asthma, and for stupid corrupt reasons.. a few years back Asthma medication got a whole lot worse, a whole lot more expensive, and way harder to use.
I use a liquid that I put into an atomizer called the EZBreath... and it is a piece of shit, it uses a vibrating fine wire mesh to atomize the liquid.  No matter how much you clean this fucker, the mesh will clog and the whole unit will become useless right when you are in the middle of a life threatening medical situation.
Do you think some form of Electronic Cigarette would work to atomize the liquid?  I have heard of people trying it, but no definite answers if it is possible or not, and I have heard that ECigs atomizers are totally different, yet not all the same.

Adoption increasing and market share increasing due to the fact that bitcoin has many benefits over the current financial systems of cash, check, wires, or even paypal.


What?  When people want bitcoin demand goes up, positive news... increase in price.


More adoption will curb market share, we gain adoption by a slow and steady growth in usage, the more you can do with bitcoin, the more the value goes up, the more the value goes up, the more things bitcoin can be used for.

Of course you cant prove it 100%, but if you see coins moving between a set of addresses where you have evidence that one entity owns all of the involved keys, it is likely still the original entity moving the coins.  It is logical that if someone was to steal the coins, they would move them to a new address, and not be re-using old addresses.

They have an interesting approach, but ultimately the thing you need in currency is market share, bitcoin is winning that race by a long shot, and I doubt any competitor can catch up.  One benefit alt-coins have is that bitcoin blazed a trail.

The incentives for cheaper energy already existed pre bitcoin.
The incentives for high density server farms did not really exist pre bitcoin, several bitcoin miners ran into this issue trying to host miners in traditional server rooms... the heat and electrical demands were just so different from everything else those data-centers were equipped to handle.
So while you are right... you cant attribute the drive for cheep energy to bitcoin, cheep energy is universally better if you were using POW or POS.

IF bitcoin is still used in 10 years, I do not see how it will not have a value of that or more.
Bitcoin CAN NOT stay static where it is at, the value is supported by the EXPECTATION of growth.  If bitcoin is not replaced by another system... I imagine each bitcoin will be worth far more then we can imagine.
Human minds do not understand exponential growth.. or large numbers.
If you asked me in July of 2010 if we would be at $1,000 a bitcoin in 2014, I would have said no.  I only got 50 bitcoins back then, If I would have known... I would have stored up a few more XD

This question has been answered here and elsewhere several times.
POS is not decentralized... you need a checkpoint set to avoid the history attack.  And there is nothing that is expended really when doing POS, so there is nothing to keep you mining only on an honest chain, with POS you can mine on the Honest chain and all other chains just in case an alternate chain wins.
Further, bitcoin fees are no where near $0.41 right now, and floating fees are coming in the next update.  Then once we add in bigger block sizes AND block chain pruning, fees can remain small.
If that does not solve the problem, sidechains could, and we have micropayment channels... and all sorts of other possible solutions, we just have to implement a few of them.
POS does not work, because there is nothing at stake really...

I have no source, but just think about what we know.
51% attacks are common knowledge in bitcoin, someone who mines should know about a 51% attack.
Ghash has been a large pool with hundreds of posts like this encouraging people to point their miners elsewhere, any sane miner would have done this already for reasons stated in this thread and elsewhere.
We know some people who have CEx.io already point their miner to a different pool, but they do not have physical control of the hardware.
Just observing the network, and applying some logic... you can see that they own a lot of physical hardware.  If you further apply logic you will see that pointing that hardware to other pools does nothing to solve the real underlining problems.

I recommend a three tiered system, possibly a 4th.
The bulk of your coins should be in cold storage, there they are safe and secure, but they are more difficult to spend.  It is also some what defeats the security if you spend from cold storage all the time.
Slightly more coins you may want to store on a computer based wallet like Bitcoin QT or Armory, easier to move and access to these coins.
The lease number of coins on some web wallet, easiest to get to but you have less control of your funds, and are exposed to some counter party risk.
A fourth option is some coins on your phone just for ease of use.
There is no best wallet is what i am getting at, be smart and use multiple.  Do not hold all your coins in one basket.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:01:55
When you import a key, you just take the same key that is on the paper and add it to your phone.  You now have your private key in two places.
When you sweep a key, you create a transaction to send the money from one private key, to a new private key.  You are moving the money and now the money is only in one place.
If you have another, more specific question, let me know.

When will you people understand... Just having them point their mining to other pools does NOTHING to solve the problem.  The problem is that they OWN that much hashing power, and you can only buy your own miners to stop that.

The current best idea is to move the decimal point over till there are only 2 points to the right of the decimal.  This makes bitcoin similar to the USD and other currencies, and helps bitcoin work with many current implementations of financial software.

I am still confused by these "decentralized exchanges" people say you will be able to sell for USD, but in actuality you will be trading derivatives.  If you want to actually do something... you need to sell your USD for BTC to then actually spend, you wont be able to do anything with the USD because, it is not real USD.
I highly doubt these exchanges will be useful for price discovery, since the underlying asset is always BTC.
Am I confused with this?  To me it seems like the true distributed exchanges will be like what localbitcoins is doing, and why mycelium plans to do.

With bitpays paid plans, you can get your fees to much lower then a tenth of a percent... you pay $30 for the month, for processing of up to 10,000 a day.  That is way cheaper.
And hell, you could get it even cheaper (but with more hassle) by taking bitcoin directly.
That chart is showing bitpays entry plan, and not a "real" plan that any business would actually use.

The act of processing the transactions is a trivial part of the mining process when it comes to the computing power used. A single standard CPU today could process all the transactions currently on the bitcoin network, and actually already does in many cases.  The "difficult" part of mining is the proof of work, which is essentially the computer trying to guess a number to win the right to have their block be included in the chain.

Bitcoins are fully traceable.  You can trace any coin all the way back to the block in which it was originally mined.  A Mixer does nothing to stop you form tracing the ownership of a coin, it only adds more transactions and mixes them with other coins to try and hide what coins were used for... but you can still trace each and every coin from where it is sitting now, back to its original block.
The history of every bitcoin ever moved is in the public ledger.  Maybe you should learn what words mean,

Because with PoS and there being no cost associated with minting stake, you can mint stake on any number of possible chains you like...  When there is some effort behind the proof... real work... you are pushed to remain honest and mine on the main chin.

When you consider how much wealth is lost in having to convert one currency to another, or to move currency from one place to another 100B is a small price to pay.

It is a reasonable argument that mining uses resources, and if you could get the same benefits as bitcoin without the costs, it would be better... but I agree POS is not the solution.
My biggest issue has to deal with 51% attacks... with mining, you have a way out.  With POS, if people gather enough coins to start doing bad things, you just have to abandon the coin.
I feel like since I own bitcoin I am biased against POS, it would save a good amount of money... but there is a reason Satoshi chose computing power for the work, and not something else.

I thought your idea of donating X% of the pool was good.  If you set it to a small fraction of the total amount on a more regular basis, the fund would build up to some degree, guaranteeing a more regular increased profit on P2P.  If the donations are straight up whatever is in the account, and it varies wildly, miners may just ignore it as not being something they can include in their profit calculations.  If they know there is 100btc in the fund, and there will be 1% of that given out every hour... they can extrapolate out what benefit they would get.

You fucking tool... Firstly quote doog in full.  He DID NOT encourage the person to bet.
Further, the incident with the 1,300 BTC you totally misrepresented.  What happened was that Nakowa, a large wale player on JD requested a withdrawal, being that doog follows good security practices, a withdrawal of that size is only done manually.  Doog sent the coins but then forgot to deduct the coins from Nakowa's account.
Doog first offered to cover the losses himself, but in solidarity many people, including myself, offered to pitch in to help cover it.  Then someone pointed out something...  quoted from the article you linked.


Doog is one of the most trusted members of the bitcoin community, and only someone ignorant of his history and his character would say something like this.

I would encourage you to get the blockchain via torrent, as it will speed up the process for you, and reduce strain on the network (the bitcoin network is not optomized as best it could be for file sharing)
bandwidth usage can be rather large, depending on how many connections you have and how many new people are spinning up nodes.  I have no hard data on this, bit it is significant.
I believe there are ways to run a node with a small memory footprint... but cant find the information I am looking for.
I hope at least the torrent helps you on your path, welcome to the party.

If they do offer an affiliate program, they need to vet people first.  We cant have just anyone approaching businesses in the name of bitpay or coinbase.
I think the best thing to do is spread information at this time, which is why I am watching the bitcoin bigfoot project with their fliers.

This article is so wrong it hurts...


You can run SHA-256, I mined on my laptop for a year doing just that.  Scrypt is not faster, or easier... in fact in a way it is harder, and was meant to be for specific reasons to stop ASICS, which has now failed.
Faster confirmations only make each confirmation worth less... and the worth of a confirmation in terms of security is defined by the hashing power behind it, in which bitcoin wins by a long shot.
The "affordability" issue is only one of Unit bias and misunderstanding of how bitcoin works, and this is being resolved.
I could go on and on, but this article is shit.  The MAJOR benefit Litecoin may have had was ASIC resistance, which has recently died... Litecoin will die soon as well.

People can easily track your businesses funds.  They can see what you are doing with the money.
If an address ends up holding a good number of coins and it is known that you keep that address hot (by the frequency of payments in and out) people may target you for a hack.
Long term re-using addresses exposes the private key to some security vulnerabilities (this effect is small to my knowledge)
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:48:48
The "caveats" and "gotchas" are still in my opinion more manageable in the long term then alternatives.  The reason many people find it hard and confusing is that it is so new.  We grew up with the current banking system, we understand physical security.  People have had to use passwords to secure online systems for over a decade now and we still have not gotten people to use good passwords practices.
Bitcoin lets you send money anywhere with no controls on that at nearly no cost... market forces will drive bitcoin into adoption and people will be compelled to figure out the tricks to managing bitcoin.
Not only that, but bitcoin is still young.  This will get, and has already gotten, way easier to use over the years.

The way you phrased your post says you do not really understand much about bitcoin.  You do not really... sign up for it.

No, you misunderstand the problem.  When you mine you are tying to solve a math problem.  Whoever solves the problem gets the reward.  This "randomly" distributes who solves blocks and builds the trustless network that is bitcoin.  If you encoded some rules about who could solve blocks, and who cant, you ruin core aspects of bitcoin.

Because they set the code to be that way.  The thing is... conformations are only worth how much computing power is behind them.  If you make your confirms faster, but change nothing else, all you do is make each confirmation worth less...
Humans are silly though and would think that a 10 confirmation maxcoin may be just as good as a 10 confirmation bitcoin, this is not the case.

We need some trust based middleman service so that people who are still ignorant about computer security can have access to some of the benefits of bitcoin.

Sure there may be people trying to manipulate the market, but what they do simply effects supply and demand...
Lets say they spread fud... that reduces damand.  Lets say they put up massive buy walls, that reduces supply.  Maybe they start dumping cold coins, that increases supply!  Or maybe they get their famous friends to come out on the news in support of bitcoin... that increases demand.  No matter what anyone does... it all boils down to supply and demand.
Now how do you figure people are dumping money into the system to manipulate the market down... are they buying up coins at a higher price to then sell at a lower price at a personal loss JUST to fuck with bitcoin?  Seems strange to me.
And your theory that bitcoin would be brought to $10...  to "reduce volatility and increase usability"  If bitcoin were at $10, it would only represent ~100million in value.  That is not enough funds to operate any even mid size money transmission service...  We almost move that in a day, that would be insane!
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:20:11
1) You could mine on your existing hardware, but it would not be cost effective.  Mining has evolved from using CPU to GPU then to FPGA, and now nearly all mining is done on custom ASIC.
2) I doubt they would care about your servers at all, they would offer no benefit to them... they just want your power and cooling, and a small bit of bandwidth.
3) They would probably need special racks made, the power and heat density of bitcoin mining is unlike anything you have probably seen before.
Let me know if you have further questions.

That level of price control while possible is not the scope of which I am talking... the amount of bitoins and fiat you would need to permanently fix the price at $500 would be endless.
The only other way to fix the price long term would be able to control the supply of bitcoin in the market, which would require some central entity to decided when to pull when to dump.

Possible?  Yes, Logical?  No.  Purchasing bitcoin is far easier, and has far less risk.  If mining was a losing game, people would not play in it.
The reason MOST people think it is not profitable, is because it is not profitable for them.  If you are not negotiating electricity rates in an already cheep place to get electricity, with some advantage on cooling costs over normal data centers... you may lose.... but people playing the game smart are making money.

Why are we not all up in arms about this?  Because some of us have been around the block and have seen this before.  In 2011 with Deepbit, in 2013 with BTC guild, and now in 2014 with Ghash...
Everyone knows what needs to happen, and each time it happens.  The issue is that people do not like variance, and new miners look at pie charts of who is the biggest player and mine there for low variance.
Soon hobbiest miners will be out of the picture, and we will have several large data centers competing for hashing power, and this will stop happening to some extent.

This is just added complexity... This provides no utility over using bitcoin directly...
I know nothing about Vertcoin, but in general POS coins are bad, because there is nothing... at stake.
There are major issues with proof of stake, namely that you expend no cost for the stake, so you are not really staking anything.  The result of this is that you can work on multiple versions of the current blockchain at the same time and pick the result which best supports your needs.  With bitcoin, you are compelled to work for the honest fork because working on other dishonest chains takes more work, which costs you resources you could be putting to earning money on the honest version of the chain.

Find me any coin stored on any address, and I can tell you 100% without a doubt what address had the coins before it, and before that... all the way back to the block it was mined in.

It's worth whatever people will pay for it.  The good thing about it is how it's value is totally elastic and will expand or contract to be perfect for whatever it's current market impact is.
I think its application as a currency for internet specific usage alone will cause it to have a value of at least $10,000 a coin.  That is value for tipping, gambling, pornography, paying for simple work (fiver or Odesk style stuff).

Pettycoin is an interesting solution that seems to be able to scale.  The system would involve some trust in gateways, but as the developer says in his talk... if you are using any amount of value of any significance on petty coin... you are doing it wrong.  Any time you even got to a dollar of value, you could move it back to the no trust needed bitcoin network.  So the most you would ever lose is small.

Bitcoin needs more usability improvements, but it is far from unusable.  As an experiment I gave a decent sum of money to a random person at one of my last presentations on bitcoin and asked him to report back to his class the next week how he found the experience of using bitcoin.
He came back and not only had he purchased a few shirts with bitcoin, but he found someone in California looking for a classic Nintendo game he happened to own and sold his copy for BTC.
Back in the early days of the internet it was unusable by the masses because very few people had computers, and computers were still foreign.  Now with computers and the internet more ubiquitous it is far easier to get into things.

I would estimate at least 30% of all coins that exist today are gone forever.
Your sources for missing coins are however flawed.  The SR coins are not lost, they have moved recently and will be sold, also there are not 600,000 of them.  The Gox coins were lost over several years... to people who took them.  The keys are not lost, I imagine Karpeles can still access the keys... there are just no coins on those keys.
Most of the coins were lost for the simple reason that for a long time they had no value, and that for a long time there existed no best practices for storage.
I personally lost several thousand coins due to my ignorance on immature coins.  When you mine new coins, you can not spend them for 100 blocks (used to be 120 I believe).  I, and several other people, were not aware of this day one after installing the client.  So what do you do after your computer found 200 coins over night and you cant spend them?  Well, what I did was delete my wallet, uninstall, and re-install the program.
"You idiot! Why didn't you back up your wallet"  Because why... the coins were worth nothing, I got those coins by leaving my shitty laptop run when I was not using it using the universities power, and I could always get more.
People now truly have no idea what it was like back in 2010.  I can say most of us knew bitcoin was revolutionary, but most of us also treated bitcoin as a test case, we viewed bitcoin as if it was what the testnet is now, few... if any people thought this first implementation was going to be what it is today.

~~Bitcoin~~ Dogecoin 
I believe... unless the developer listened to reason and did switch to Bitcoin like he should.  I had an argument with him in the last thread where he kind of tried to argue dogecoin was better for his needs... I disagree.
His reasons with my counters:


Users of MDMA are fun and friendly, but that does not mean you should hire them to work for you...


That is just displaying unit bias, use the base unit of the BIT and your problems are solved, or just use Satoshies.


Faster confirmations only make each confirmation worth less as a confirmation... also, bitcoin has more hashing power behind it making it in a way more secure.


Bitcoin has orders of magnitude more ways to exchange it.
I really feel the DEV decided to use Doge when things with doge were on the up and up and he could ride the hype train... that train has died and is starting to fall off the cliff, he would be wise to switch to Bitcoin.

THIS is not a valid solution.  If anyone thinks them buying hashing power from CEX.io and pointing it to P2Pool is helping, they do not understand the problem.
A pool having control of 51% of the mining power, is less of a risk then one entity OWNING 51% of the hashing power.  Who physically owns the hardware matters more.
Further, GHash limiting their own power does not help the underlining security risk. Outside forces preventing their ability to get 51% are still needed...
Lets build up P2Pool and make it better, lets start encouraging people who know what they are doing to buy some mining power.  Also, we need to DISCOURAGE cloud mining in general.

You generally have it.  Bitcoins are records in a public ledger, the blockchain.  Accounts balances are recorded as being associated with a public key, which is derived from a private key.  If you know the private key you can assign the coins to some other public key.
Since the keys are just data, you can store them any way you could store data, on paper, in your head, on a computer.
To spend the coins, you do not necessarily need to import the key into an online app per say... you just need to use that key to sign a transaction.
Dooglus (well known to some in the bitcoin community) has a system where he stores his private keys on an offline computer, uses that computer to generate QR codes of signed transactions, which he then scans with another computer that is online, to broadcast to the network.  In this way the internet never has the opportunity to see the private keys.
Let me know if you have any other questions.

My point is that so many people seem to think we are in uncharted waters, and that there is no way bitcoin can survive X situation.  People do not realize that we have already been through a lot in the last few years.
We have already seen single entities get 51% of the network, we have already seen people execute successful double spends, we have already seen massive bugs and huge security holes, we have already seen hard forks of the chain, and we have already seen rampant market manipulation, we have already seen government banning and regulation... and bitcoin is still here.  Nearly everyone's worst fear of some catastrophe that could kill bitcoin, has already happened multiple times, and yet it still stands.

Firstly the signed transaction is sent directly to the merchent, they dont have to watch the network for the transaction, they get it directly (and can then decide if they want to wait for a confirmation, or just trust that it will confirm.)
They can sign the payment request with a certificate so the customer knows the payment is going to the right place.
The merchant can specify a memo so that there is some more information about what the payment is about.
The customer can specify a return address to if a refund is needed, you can easily get a refund.
All of these things GREATLY improve usability.

Bitcoin is to money, what the internet is to communication.  The internet made communication cheep, fast, and global and now bitcoin is doing the same for money.  With bitcoin, it acts like cash.  Unlike credit cards or checks where you are basically handing the keys to your account to someone and trusting they will only take out what they are owed, when you send bitcoin the receiver has no access to take more, even accidentally.
Other aspects of bitcoin make it perfect for online transactions.  With bitcoin the payments are secure and can be trusted, there is no need to provide your name, address, phone number as it is now common to have to do with online payments... with bitcoin you can simply pay for a service and keep your privacy.
In the light of money being used as a weapon in the modern age, bitcoin is fundamentally necessary to protect free speech.

What... how is that.  The major action gox is accused of is operating on a fractional reserve, allowing trades of bitcoin they did not have.  When you operate on a fractional reserve, you inflate the currency base and devalue the currency... if there are more units trading then there should be... supply and demand... price falls.
The only thing that drove the price up on gox to my knowledge was the lack of fiat withdraws... sellers were demanding more money to compensate for the slow and painful withdrawal time.

He did.  One early post of his is sort of on topic, about GPU's and recognizing that they would eventually take over.
The big question I ask people about this question is "what is the other option"?  He had to choose something for the proof, and any proof of work will eventually centralize.  Sure, some POW's are resistant to ASIC's, but they are NOT resistant to centralization.  Data centers in Iceland will always be more cost effective then a laptop in a New York apartment, there is just no way around it.
The thing to remember however, is that this centralization will probably NOT end up being one super power, it will likely be several powers all fighting each other, this is much better then the current system of a central bank with the final say.

Ripple is trash and everyone knows that.  I haven't read any news on it but I cant believe it is still even functioning at any level.  Most of the development staff that mattered abandoned the project from what I recall. They were a blatant cash grab.
BitShares is a somewhat interesting one, there is a lot of competition however, and no real leader in the crypto asset market that I have seen.
MaidSafe is promising a lot and had a super hyped IPO, even if they can deliver, I imagine Etherium will steal their thunder.
NXT is absolute trash.
Peercoin actually does have something, I actually hold some PPC because I am interested in POS, but fundamentally I have been convinced that POS does not work.
Counterparty is interesting, but again, lot of competition in the crypto asset market.
Darkcoin, i really feel that if you want anonymity you can get it with bitcoin, and that the efforts driven to make darkcoin work well should instead be put to making bitcoin tools easier to use.
Namecoin is good.
The only other name I recognize in the top 20 is StorjCoin, I am not convinced their system will work.  And even if it does work, I don't believe that there is a huge market for storage space except for at the institutional level, and with little to no consumer adoption, how is StorjCoin ever going to grow to where it could support consumer adoption?  I hope I am wrong, because StorjCoin does look cool.

I have a subscription via my University... I will be editing this posts with comments.
I have watched days worth of content on Lynda, including your drupal videos... so this should be good.
Edit:  PLEASE do not take these comments as I HATE your video... I LOVE it so far... but I know sometimes these videos are updated, and if they are it is good to know things you could change.
1. Exists only online?  This is probably going to confuse people.
2.  People were attracted for its "semi anonymous nature"  I suppose this works, I always prefer pseudonymous when I explain it.
3.  Bitcoin does not have an official site...  Bitcoin.org itself does not claim this, if you look at the bottom they state they are "A community website sponsored by Foundation The Bitcoin Foundation"
4.  Choosing a wallet video is one that needs to be re-done.  The IOS allowing wallets now is such a huge change to the information, it warrants some form of update to let users know that they have options.
5.  Calling web wallets insecure may not be a good idea... a general user probably has an insecure computer... but may know how to properly manage a password.  In that case a web wallet may be better for them.
6.  While a wallet can be just one address... wallets can have multiple addresses... you seem to be using the terms interchangeably, which they are not.
7.  WAIT AN HOUR?  Although this is true... for the VAST majority of transactions one confirmation is more then enough, and really... making sure your transaction is fully propagated can also be good enough in most situations.  I REALLY dislike you stressing for people to wait an hour.   Hopefully the new BIP for zeroconf multisig guarantees goes through well.
Edit, done with the course.  This was really good!  Thank you for this.

This is limited utility escrow... you cant enter or leave the market with this system, only move around inside of it.  Now sure, once you reach mass adoption this is not an issue... but the main thing people want a decentralized exchange for is to help with on-boarding of new people.  If you have to hold as much or more of a crypto asset as you are looking to get to hold in escrow, there is no way to onboard I can see.

Possibly, bitcoin may soon be a driver in pushing technology further then it would otherwise.  The usage for high end computers right now is mostly for gaming, there are research uses... but they end up typically using hardware originally meant for gaming.
If bitcoin mining continues to grow, we are going to see advances in cooling and high density computing that would possibly have taken decades to emerge without the incentives of bitcoin pushing things along.

The limiting factor of transactions to a block is file size.  The network does not care how many transactions are pending.  If there are lots of transactions pending, more then can be fit into a block... they are prioritized by many factors, including fee.
The block size could be increased, but people are worried about blockchain bloat.  There are several solutions.  Off chain transactions, blockchain pruning and block size increase, alt coins, better fee structure... etc.

I assume from this that you support tree chains...  I have recently started watching the dev mailing list, and it seems Gavin has a fair point in that bitcoin itself is not the place to implement such a sweeping change.  I feel this project would be better suited to iron out in an alt...  
I heard some mention from peter that if side chains were implemented, tree chains could be the be all end all side chain, and leaving bitcoin itself safe if things blow up, do you feel this would work?
I would say if you do feel tree chains are a good idea, maybe you should advocate for them on the list... ideas from peter seem to be met with harsh criticism in a small part due to who they are coming from.  I feel your also are better with words.

1. No one controls 51% of the network right now. 
2.  When the previous "attack" happened, no one had 51% of the network.  Ghash had under 30% at the time, and BTCGuild was the major pool.
3.  When the previous attack happened, Ghash.io was under different ownership.

With the payment protocol... BIP70 this functionality is probably the best way to do things, but not every service supports it yet.  Back in the day (when satoshi probably wrote this) ... when you sent coins you sent them to an IP address and the wallet handled keys in the background, do to issues with NAT and MIM attacks people started to just use addresses directly, and the client was changed to remove the send to ip function.

Mr. Buffet, you claim bitcoin is not a currency because it fails on some of the measures economics puts on a currency.  Bitcoin may indeed not be a currency, many people believe it to be somewhere between a currency, a stock, and a commodity.
Bitcoin can be used as simply a public record, or a method of transfer of wealth, or possibly a method to create smart properties.  There are many possible uses of bitcoin, only one of which is use as a currency.  Failing as a traditional currency does not mark failure of bitcoin.

There is an old thread on BCT that tracked known lost coins.  The issue is that some coins are more lost then others.  There are coins sent to black hole addresses, those are really dead.  There are coins that people lost the keys to, those keys could be found.  And then there are coins that just never moved, well, that is only weak evidence that they are lost, they could just be in deep cold storage.

Let's take a current situation.  A majority of bitcoiners HATE the government.  Even more so, they HATE the US government.

If all of the USD on these decentralized exchanges will be created using derivatives, how does this solve the problem of people on boarding into the bitcoin world?  People with "real" USD will still need to find some way to get some bitcoin, which they can then use on these exchanges to day trade... but they cant actually get bitcoin using these exchanges.

Here we go...
Bitcoins are stored in a ledger, and are assigned to addresses.  Addresses come in pairs of public and private.  Blocks store transaction information and if a transaction gives you money when your wallet software is not online, you will download it when you come back online.
If you uninstall the app, make sure you back up your private keys first, to import them into a new wallet.
Any other questions?

Interesting... I was doing some research into the rights of tribal nations and the opportunities for bitcoin related stuff.  One thing I ran into is that although sovern in some respects they have a few limitations.  One of those limitations was the minting of their own currency.  I forget where I read this... but now I can't seem to find it.
for a while I was drafting up plans to propose a bitcoin exchange on tribal lands to get one "in the united states" but to avoid all the regulation... I just never went anywhere with the plan.
If anyone has more information on this, I would be interested.

Most alts, in my opinion, exist because people feel they missed the boat on bitcoin, so they attach themselves to an alt and hope it will some day take over bitcoin.
Years ago, people were calling the final months of bitcoin, and so they jumped ship to some alt.  People like Dan Kaminsky believed that SHA256 mining, and the existence of ASIC's would break bitcoin, they have yet to be right.

Nearly all of the crypto coins you mention share so much of the bitcoin codebase, your argument is invalid.  If bitcoin fails for some reason, it is HIGHLY likely that whatever caused the problem, will cause problems for most other crypto currencies.
Also, if bitcoin crashes for some technical issue, and not a market action... the "value" just disappears, with no time to move it to any other unit of value.  If someone finds a bug in the code that allows spending of any funds, creation of extra coins... all the value of bitcoin just vanishes.
The only real effect MOST cryptocurrencies have is to trap noobs into pump and dump scams, and to provide some unwanted inflation in the market.

TD does not have to offer a discount yet... because there is little competition in their market for bitcoin.  Once newegg or amazon comes online, one of them may take some of the savings they get from processing in bitcoin and pass that on to customers to attract more customers... and then the cycle continues.
We are in the early stages.  TD wants you to spend BTC there because they make more money (i believe), so they are spending advertising dollars on them accepting bitcoin.

The basic problem is that If I send you a private key with bitcoins on it, and say "here you go! instant payment." you give me my product... and then after I walk out the door I broadcast a transaction using the original copy of the private key you have no way of knowing I did not keep.

What would you replace it with?  There needs to be a proof of someting to make bitcoin like systems work.  Many people are looking at proof of stake as the option to go to because it prevents mining "waste".  I find proof of stake simply absurd... you hard code "the rich get richer".
People argue that mining also makes the rich get richer... but actually an inventive soul that finds cheaper electricity, better cooling, or more optimized hardware can make an effort in mining.

But... peter needs to do nothing to make ZeroConf insecure... they have always been insecure, this is a demonstrable fact.  Ask nearly any core dev, and they will tell you that you should not accept zero confirmation transactions.
I personally would be find accepting a zero conf transaction for the sale of small value goods... as the risk someone is going through the effort for such small gain seems low.  Their reputation is probably more important then the gains they would get.  But you would have to be an idiot not to wait for a a few confirms for a large transaction.

The positive news was leaked before the hearings, you can look on reddit and even see posts and news articles stating that the hearings would be positive weeks before they had them, not only that but SR shutting down also had an impact (which was also an act of the US government).
Many people did attribute things to china, but I believe we were all wrong, if you look at volume, much of it was artificial due to the 0% trading fee they had.  China is only about 10% of trade volume right now...

This... is a really good question!  I don't know the answer but I assume with what I know of bitcoin the coins would technically be on the first address.  And you would have a signed transaction that is not yet valid but will eventually become valid after a specified time.

Silver has a place next to gold, there are practical limits on how you can divide up gold and as such... to represent smaller values it is helpful to have a less valuable commodity to fill in for small exchanges of value.  Imagine if you had to trade with gold dust to buy a gumball...
Bitcoin can be divided up to 8 decimal places, so much so that the smallest unit represents $0.0000064.  If we ever needed bitcoin to represent smaller units, we can change the protocol to allow it.  What use then, does litecoin have?  The only thing it does, is help people out who have Unit Bias and can not get over it.

By asking this question, you are showing that you are not familiar with bitcoin or how it works, so please don't advertise to people that you know what you are talking about, because you will be misleading them.
Yes, any coins sent to any address can be accessed any time as long as you have the private key.  The "coins" are just records on the public ledger (the blockchain).  You can send coins to any valid address, at any time.  The private key simply allows you to authorize the "moving" of coins from one address to another.

They are doing it because larger blocks take more time to propagate, if they keep their blocks small they get less orphans...

No... but it is more complicated then that.
If mining is more profitable, more people enter in.  Once too many people enter in, the people with the highest electricity costs and the most outdated hardware drop out.
Bitcoin mining is a self balancing system that always gravitates to being just barely profitable, and always seeks the cheapest electricity, the best hardware, and the most effective cooling systems.
This is why ASIC centralization is a non issue, economics causes centralization of mining.

The way out is to exit and start a new, and show others how to live a free life.  Destroy the old systems by withdrawing consent, and building new systems built on voluntary participation.

7/20/2010 20:53 - Using the block chain I can tell exactly when, which is kind of cool.


I have always been interested in technology, I first heard about bitcoin on slashdot.


No, having been in bitcoin for a while, this is not surprising to me, just another bump in the road.


At least once a week, It is more convenient I believe.  It is not hard to scan a QR code, and with the payment system coming in bitcoin 0.9.0 it will be even easier.


Probably... I am not sure but I think I had a computer that was mining for a year inbetween 2010 and 2011 that I cant locate the hard drive of, I don't really look for it because I am happy with what bitcoin I have mostly.


More then is sane, which is why I sell bitcoin to people to help them get started to slowly hedge some risk.


A few things, but all things that are already planned really, the payment protocol, HD wallet specification, multisig, coinjoin, chain pruning...  Most of the development needs to happen on the levels above bitcoin.  Bitcoin is like TCPIP, the lower level of the internet... people today do not realize they are using tcpip, they just use a browser and go to google, we need to get those types of services built on top of bitcoin.

I have been around since the beginning, sending a private key was NEVER the way to send coins.  The way it used to be was that you could sent coins to an IP address... then the client on the other side would give the sending computer an address to pay to, and the coins were moved.  This was eventually removed because of several issues like man in the middle attacks, and issues with shared IP's.  This type of functionality is coming back in 0.9.0 in a different way with the payment protocal, which you can read about in BIP 70-73, or via any number of videos online.

Maybe you could never get coins from bitinstant, but several thousand people did get their first coins through bitinstant.
He operated a Bar in NY that accepted bitcoin, or maybe still accepts it, that was a good hang out in the early days.
He was working with the foundation and tried to work with regulators like Lawsky(sp) to figure out how things were going.
And his crime... is a non crime.  Money laundering is a joke of a crime.  If we really cared about money laundering we would get rid of the $100 bill and start moving away for cash in general.  The $100 bill enables money laundering on a scale far larger then bitcoin does currently, and rarely is it used in daily commerce of Americans.

Even if regulation is a bad thing for bitcoin, the major reason all the hearings in the US have been positive (ya know, the thing that caused BTC to go to &gt;1,000 in value) was due to the work of Charlie and the Foundation at large.

No, when you find a block, you get the block reward AND transaction fees.  At the beginning of bitcoin, there were few to no transactions but the block reward was high, at the end of bitcoin, the block reward will be low... but the money from transactions will hopefully be higher.
This is stated in the original whitepaper, I encourage you to read it!

I would say so, If they were insolvent, they were selling btc that they did not have, inflating the supply of BTC.  If it is shown that there were less btc on the market then previously thought, price goes up.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:46:24
Volatility is an issue that is slowly solving itself, look at today for example we have some of the worst news in bitcoin history and the price flinches a bit.  Over time, volatility is decreasing.
Even with volatility, bitcoin is still viable as a payment network, services like bitpay can cut the risk of businesses accepting bitcoin to almost 0.
When you compare bitcoin to other currencies with similar currencies pools, we are not actually that volatile.  When a pool is small, even a small impact makes big waves, as the pool grows larger, you need bigger disruptions to even notice something is going on.
I would encourage you to look up other countries and see how volatile they are.  Comparing the volatility of bitcoin with its 6billion market to the US or Euro with a 2 and 6trillion dollar base is not a fair comparison.

Erik Voorhees answers this point best in several of his talks.
Firstly nothing has inherent value, value is totally subjective. 
What matters is utility, bitcoin has higher utility as a payment system then the dollar, gold... or any other non crypto system.  The payments are faster, cheaper, have no middle man... and are part of a global system.
People who say a backed version of bitcoin would be better, do not understand the problems that bitcoin solves and how bitcoin works.  They also are ignorant of the history of people trying to solve this problem.
If you back or peg a currency, you have to have a central authority to do the pegging or backing.  Someone has to hold the physical asset... we tried those types of currency before... and governments shut them down.
Bitcoin is revolutionary because it provides the security from double spending, AND removes the need for a central authority to handle that roll.  The cost of that is that the unit is 100% virtual, and some thought because of that... it would never have value.  Thankfully we have speculators and people who like pizza to bootstrap a value, to then increase the utility of the unit... which then creates a positive feedback loop we have been enjoying for the last 4 years.

Not fully sure, although the change is going back to the source address... it is possible friedcat is being careful to not spend that output in the next transaction and that even though they look chained as far as addresses go, as far as unspent outputs go, they are not.

They do it by making shitty assumptions that make people believe things that are not true.  The Bitcoin network is highly limited as far as computation in what in can do.

Actually... with faster block times... the network latency effect is more prominent and block withholding attacks are more effective.
Also, a 51% attack is just as likely on slower or faster block times... if you outpace the rest of the network, no frequency of blocks changes this.
For small transactions, just watching network propagation is really good enough as long as the majority of miners apply the seen first rule (which most if not all do).  ZeroConf transactions will also get more secure if the greenaddress zeroconf bip gets passed.

What I said is correct, here is the issue the other poster is talking about.  If you generate NEW addresses after you make your backup, then yes... you need to update your backup.  If you keep sending and receiving from addresses you already have, then your backup is fine.  From how you worded your question, it appeared you thought the coins were somehow stored in your wallet, which is not the case.  The coins are stored on the blockchain.  This is something fundamental to bitcoin.  If you do not understand that, you are not in any way familiar with bitcoin.

Firstly, the keys to the coins were not lost, the coins were slowly scammed out of MtGox, they do not have the coins, other people do.
Secondly, no one can re mint new private for existing addresses once lost.  The point of bitcoin is almost so that this is impossible.  You control your money, and no one else can, even if they REALLY want to.
What you are suggesting is fundamentally impossible in the bitcoin system.

The block 6th deep in the chain was 140 min ago.  We would expect that in 140 min we would have 14 blocks, but we have only had 6.  We are 8 blocks short of what we should be seeing.  Divide 2.8mb into 8 blocks and you get 358.4, if we were operating at expected... we would be fine right now.
If this problem persists, the difficulty adjusts down so we get closer to expected.

Possibly just to arbitrage.  There are many exchanges that pair BTC/DOGE and if there is enough market spread, the speed of bitcoin allows you to close the spread and turn a profit.

Anyone that needs to be spoon fed information to such a degree as you suggest, is not the kind of person that is going to contribute to bitcoin at this stage of things... and will probably only start to use it after everyone else is already using it.

You are totally wrong...
The idea behind his coins was that he was a trusted entity loading the coins, so that you could use them offline and know that they had bitcoin on them.  Hence why he used tamper proof holograms on the coins so that if it was ever opened and redeemed, you could not then pass it off as if it was loaded.
These coins actually served that purpose at PorkFest a few times if I recall, but their actual use never caught on, and they quickly became a collector item.

No one typed this in as a fee, they just never set a destination for the other part of the coins.  When you spend an output, any part you dont send to someone is considered the fee.  As others have said, this was someone messing around with a special client or with raw transactions.

Did you read nothing I said?  Since it costs you nothing to stake coins, you can stake your coins on all possible versions of the current blockchain and pick the result that best rewards you, you can do this because it takes no additional resources to stake your coins multiple times.  This is not possible with Bitcoin because if you did POW for multiple chains, your costs would far outweigh the benefits you have to compute work for each different chain which costs electricity... and you stay honest.
The electricity "cost" is far lower then the traditional system to get the same things done, and as I have described it is necessary for there to be some sort of cost to keep people honest.

I agree, if you think doge &gt; bitcoin because of confirmation time... you do not understand what a confirmation really is.
For those that dont know... a confirmation is ONLY as valuable as the hashing power that backs it up.  If you are on a small alt coin, your confirms are not as secure as if they were on a bigger network.  ALSO if you give confirmations more often, you are just making each individual confirmation weaker.  If bitcoin confirmations were twice as fast... each confirmation would only give you half of the security they do now.

No I did not no, nor do I care... 


Network effect, it was here first and not many ult coins have any utility over bitcoin.
Abso-fucking-lutely nothing.
Oh, and market cap... and distribution... you think bitcoin is held mostly by a few large players?  Dogecoin is worse... I know the people who hold a majority of it, lets just say they wont be holding for much longer.


Oh, i dont know... to get money?  And even if it is true... why the fuck should I care?  You think your problems are so bad... lots of people are far FAR worse off then you, If i did care about giving money to people who needed it, you would have at least 2 billion people ahead of you in line for help.  You have access to the internet!  There are millions of people without access to books, or hell... millions without access to water!


Why do you feel so entitled to get free money... 


Our coin is superior!  The most important part of a currency is that people accept it... some people use that argument AGAINST bitcoin and for fiat... but the fundimental properties of bitcoin make it a superior payment system.  The issue is... when you compare bitoin to any alt, the differences are so minimal as to not matter... to the point where sticking with the one with the biggest market cap makes sense.
Have fun being poor!  Or maybe get over your ignorant issues with bitcoin, and ride the next bubble with the rest of us.  Doge will not be along for the ride this time.

I agree with that you are saying... but an issue remains.  Both this documentary and Life on Bitcoin have stated here on reddit their goals are to get "The widest distribution possible".  If that is their TRUE goal, they would upload it online for free.  Since they refuse to do that, they should stop making the claim such things, as it is obviously not the case.
Do I fault them for wanting to make money off of their project?  No way they are fine to do that... I only fault them for making statements that suggest one obvious action, and then taking some other action instead while not changing the original statements.

1) look up the public key on your favorite block explorer (blockchain.info)
2) I personally use Mycelium on my android phone.  They let you scan the private key and then send a payment.
3) Avoid fees?  You should pay the basic mining fee to assure your transaction is included in a block and pay to support the network... the fee is .0001 btc and soon will be much lower.

On or off blockchain is not the question you should be asking... what matters is who holds the keys.  Just because they may hold coins on blockchain, does not solve the problems you describe.

Second, this fails as an on ramp, I need to have a crypto asset to risk in escrow equal or greater in value to the one I wish to get... If I wanted bitcoin, and I did not have any bitcoin, I am shit out of luck with this system.
Thirdly, who is the escrow agent?  Is it some DAC entity?  Where do the coins go, who handles mediation?  Seems like a place for trust to enter the system if you ask me!
Tl;DR This is not the distributed exchange we are looking for.

I do believe that memes on a reddit impact the quality of all posts on that reddit, but I have no hard evidence to facilitate it.
I believe it has to do with the overall "tone" of things... and people getting into the expectation that posts can and should be consumed quickly.  Many people have shown that the length of the content in a post directly impacts how far up a page it can make it... people get bored and want things sort, hence why memes gravitate to the top.
The issue is the more macros we have taking up the high value front page, the fewer people will see those deep discussions that are buried further down... I barely have time to keep up with all the goings on in bitcoin, and I dedicate 6+ hours a day to research.
Sure memes are short and quick... but they still take time to filter through.  The problem is not bad now, but left unchecked... well there are plenty of examples of what happens when memes go unchecked on a reddit.
Added to that, the topics in bitcoin are complex, we need to build people up to tolerate longer explanations of things, and I believe psychologically image macros and memes hurt this.
Finally, for people that want memes there is a whole reddit dedicated to bitcoin memes.

affected/effected Oops my bad.  I also fall prey to homophone issues all the time as well, sucks to be me.
I find that the lack of consumer protections is more then compensated for by the lower fees in bitcoin.  I feel in general the consumer protections are more of a piece of mind then an actual value.
I would rather save 3% on every transaction I make and write off a scam as a loss, then pay 3% on every transaction so I can chargeback that 1 in 1,000 instance of me needing to use it.

Isn't this that old BlackCoin project?
Here is my big complaint with this project, it is a good idea, but it's proponents say it solves everything with distributed exchange.  The issue is one of a total lack of an ability to create any on or off ramps into the economy.
You can never enter or leave, only trade within.  If I have USD and I want BTC, I need to already have BTC to stake in the escrow to be able to buy BTC.  If I want to get out of BTC, I need to be willing to get BTC back in escrow after I sold the BTC.  And the escrow is always equal to or greater then the traded value for any sane trader right?  So there is no way to stair step down.
This may be really useful for some people right now... but all the people claiming this is the miracle solution to distributed exchange have no idea what they are talking about.
The biggest issue thing to do right now is onboarding people.  Whoever can be the AOL for bitcoin is going to make a lot of money.  It may be coinbase, it may be circle, it may be some other group... but it will never be BitHalo.

I would counter with this.  If you implement something wrong with bitcoin, you will lose your money or the money of others.  Working with bitcoin directly at first and contributing some code will show your users you have knowledge of how bitcoin works.
If you develop some tool, and have never even really touched the core bitcoin code, I would have to advocate against using whatever you come up with.
Not only that, but when you are working with bitcoin directly, you may get your own idea of something we need.

You can always argue something you said is lacking context, things move fast online and even faster in the bitcoin world.  People do not have the time to read pages and pages of text, they need people that go through those troves of information and sift through it.

If you are going to run core and also run a full node, get the blockchain.dat from torrent first.

The value of bitcoin is whatever someone is willing to give for one.  When you take many thousands of people asking for and looking to sell bitcoin for different other currencies and services, you have a market.
If that market is working well enough, and there is a good amount trading you can see an overall market price.  If more people want coins then there are currently available, the price goes up.  If people are looking to get rid of coins and they cant find buyers, they lower their expectations till buyers are found.

For my blk00234.dat file, I get MD5 = 4ECD68E51DFB2F7852CE264375D4D6D9 and SHA-1 = 2A15A99935736AE0D4AAE5BD2EA7DF34FC1A53BB
I think what actual blocks are in those files would not necessarily be the same client to client.  I am really not smart enough to specify, but for a short period of time there are chain splits, and these can become a few blocks long.  All valid blocks but just two different parts of the network worked off of different blocks found at similar times and then raced to see who's chain would become longer.
I believe this linearizing process just takes the longer chain and ignores those other valid, but not part of the main chain blocks.  I noticed the file size of my bootstrap.dat file was smaller than the blk00XXX.dat files and came to this conclusion of what was happening.
TL;DR depending on your node and what blocks you end up seeing, your blk.dat files will be different than mine, but our bootstrap.dat files should be the same.  (again, I may be wrong here, but I think im right).

You would have to broadcast that block to the network somehow so that other nodes recognize your finding, otherwise your block would be "Orphaned."

Correct me if I am wrong but this only improves fungibility.
In a world where there are counterfeits, it is hard to tell if all coins are interchangeable in value.  With this system, you can verify a coin, although it is through a central authority, and be sure that at least according to the Canadian mint it is genuine.
TL;DR Counterfeits reduce fungibility, this reduces counterfeiting, and therefore increasing fungibility.

If the coin were to be blacklisted, couldn't you just melt it down?  Also, the coin being drilled and filled is a problem with existing coins but would affect the weight of the coin which is the first thing anyone who knows anything about coins would check.
I suppose one flaw could be a coin could be marked as stolen in the system, you could be sold the coin not knowing this, then go in to check its validity at someone who has one of these scanners, and the shop owner could be compelled to take the coin from you as part of their agreement to have a scanner... hrum.

It would be interesting to see a poll of people who understood what bitcoin was, and then from there figure out who supports it and who does not.
I had the opportunity to ask Narayana Kocherlakota president of the Minneapolis fed a question on bitcoin, and he basically said the blockchain is a good idea but bitcoin itself is not, which provided evidence to me he did not really have an understanding of bitcoin enough to really have an informed opinion on it.

Off topic:  Over the last, year or so... I have been trying to contact you via email and every other means I know about to have my bitcoin talk account restored to my control.  
I lost it shortly after the database breach a while back, but did not realize as I was not paying close attention to bitcoin sites/accounts/news.  I have previously sent requests to the recovery email account to no avail... is there anything I can do to get that account back?

Having been one of the people around when an un-pooled miner using CPU only could mine a block, I can agree to this.
There are people who have thousands of coins that, if they did not lose the wallets, have yet to move their coins from their original blocks and could still play a part in the future.
@_date: 2012-11-17 02:16:44
Good points, I would suppose that there is no good answer to this.
What I imagine happening is bitcoin becoming the back end for financial transactions, and many services being built on top of bitcoin.  This actually is already happening with some bitcoin providers managing payments in bitcoin and providing the seller of the service whatever currency they want... or some people trade bitcoins to eachother in mtgox credits, where no actual bitcoins move wallets.
These large institutions which have built their services would have a vested interest in the security of the network.
Also, we have already seen that the community can take action to prevent problems from coming to fruition.  This was a while ago, but there was a good chance of some pools becoming &gt;50% of the network, through activism people split up the hashing power and more people created pools to avoid security issues.
The one other big thing that would improve security is the fact that people who mine have a vested interest in keeping security going.  If they can not afford the minimum level of hashing that would keep the network safe to the point that they have a piece of mind, they would raise their fees to cover costs of more computers.

You will not make money at mining... and even if you do somehow manage it, you would have made better money if you would have just purchased the coins.

Bitcoin is an alternate currency, the only reason anyone cares about it is because of differences like this.  Dwolla said they would not issue chargebacks which made it the perfect intermediary for USD and BTC.  They then... changed their mind.
Bitcoin worked as intended, Dwolla made a promise, and then did not keep it...

You can transfer it with no authorization, you can store it in any number of accounts... you can sell it and buy it back on any number of markets... you can use it to buy products and then sell those products.

@_date: 2012-08-08 05:04:24
I wonder how this battle will play out... I mean to attack the network, they first almost help it.  They could try to spam transactions... but the fees would help feed miners transaction fees.  Or they could do a 51% attack... but that would just grow total hashing power.  If more then one person attempts a 51% at the same time it would be hilarious.
Most people have pointed out that the best way to mess with things would be to manipulate the currency.  Problem is that this first requires a buy in.  From what I have seen bitcoin has already survived some CRAZY shit that drove most sane people away, and there are still people here.  The amount of buy in they would have to do to really mess things up would probably cause a huge price spike, which would drive media attention, which would put a damper in their plans costing them more for their buy in.
The only way left then is to mess with the security of the tools around bitcoin, or bitcoin itself.  Considering the technology involved it seems impractical to attack bitcoin head on... and any attack on main tools in the ecosystem would just cause other people to jump in at the new opportunity.  If Mtgox fell, it would probably be good because several other exchanges would fill in...  hit one mole 3 pop up elsewhere.

I was out of the bitcoin loop for a while, can you reference a specific incident?
@_date: 2012-03-09 00:27:36
That's not a fault of bitcoin though... if it was tied directly to the regular financial systems, it would lose many of the reasons it exists.
Maybe it is the fault of the greater system around bitcoin... but not directly bitcoins fault.  Bitcoin never set out to be easily transferable between traditional currencies and itself.
@_date: 2012-11-17 00:07:36
The other replies are wrong... fees will make up the difference.
Eventually there will be no reward for mining a block, as there is a hard limit on the number of coins to be produced.  Eventually the free market will determine transaction fees to cover the costs of running the hashes needed to keep the network secure and running smoothly.
@_date: 2012-07-17 19:32:18

Can someone elaborate on what this is and what it means?  
@_date: 2012-08-02 19:06:32
The issue for most is that gold has an intrinsic value, and bitcoin does not.  The value is in the tools around it, which are still developing.
What convinces me... is that there really cant be an alternative.  If someone else tries to create a digital currency, chances are they will have to resort to a similar method of proof of work block chain to make it a success.  If someone does do that, people already invested in bitcoin will attack that new guy.  It has happened several times already.
And I think we all know that current fiat currencies are going to fail... and chances are we are not going to go back to trading precious metals. So again, to me, bitcoins future is secure.

Personally I know people with free power (college dorms) or cheep power (Iceland).  I can not compete with these people... 
Other people have other optimized setups.  These are the people that make the money from mining.
I still have a block of coins in my wallet I mined with the mainline client with my CPU on my laptop... I have watched mining progress over the years.  If I would have spend that $200 I used to buy a GPU when that mess started, and put it into bitcoins (which were at the time less then a dollar in value) I would have been a much happier camper then I am now.  (although I still made out positive, I would have been richer, and less work... if I had just bought coins.)

Long term trends for bitcoin are up.  You can try and buy on the downs... but overall just slowly and steadily buy a little coin every time you think of it to average out and get a better price.
If you wait, chances are it will never return.  I remember people after the last crash thinking they would buy at .10 cents... it never got that low and they lost out as I bought up at around $3

I wish Roger Ver was more active in this space.  Andreas is really no replacement.
I like Andreas, he means well... but he refuses to just admit he does not know some things.  He makes up an answer too often.
Joe is a Comedian, it's his job to crack jokes and just have a conversation with people.
One annoying history thing he got wrong was the history of MtGox.  He previously used to say it was the first bitcoin exchange, he seems to have finally corrected himself on that.  Now he just needs to realize that it was founded by Jed McCaleb and then Sold to Mark Karpeles never had anything to do with it when it traded Magic Cards.
There were several other points he was wrong about, which for someone that does this full time he should have known better.
Basically any time he talks about the 2009/20010 era of bitcoin I groan, he was not around then and keeps getting the early history wrong.

Are you familiar with casascius and the legal trouble he ran into?  Also, how will you solve the issue of people being able to verify coins have not been spent?
Every attempt and this in the past has failed in some way.  I owned both Bitcards and Casascius coins in the past for different reasons.

You are wrong, it is possible in many situations for investments to benefit all parties involved.
The person taking the money needs capital to start a business or some other venture. The person lending the money has no other present need for the money, and can put that to use via the investment.  The person who ends up buying the product or service benefits from something that if it had not been for the previous two people, would not have been available.
If you are talking stock trading on an exchange you are a bit more right, but not totally.
Maybe you are getting into a stock you expect to go up, and the shares you purchased were from the sale of a happy investor who profited previously and is now just diversifying, they know the stock is going to continue to grow, but just want to spread out their portfolio.
Capitalism is not a 0 sum game.  Look up "Gains from trade" to learn more on a basic economic level if you want to learn more.
@_date: 2012-08-02 05:02:04
If large holders "sell the farm" that is only bad for the short term value of bitcoins, on the long term it is a good thing.
Yes if someone sells, there will be a large swing down, but then that large chunk of coins is spread out and limits this sort of action in the future.
Really, we should encourage large holders to sell out now, before there is mainstream adaptation... as that would help credibility.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:44:36
The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks.  If lots of mining power is being added to the network (from people abandoning BCH possibly?) you would expect faster block times.  Orphaned blocks used to be more common, but with better relaying tools now its less common.  I am not sure how rare it is anymore.
@_date: 2012-08-09 05:40:53
"I want to time when the price goes down to buy."  This is a bad strategy... Chances are just as likely that it will go up, as that it will go down... and if it goes down... it might keep going down.
Your best bet is to buy small amounts at a regular interval so you cancel out the risk of buying at the "wrong" time.
@_date: 2012-11-17 08:45:08
You bring up good points, but I doubt that bitcoin can go away.... and this is kind of a different point but similar.
We all see the advantages of bitcoin, and something better then it would probably still use the block chain/proof of work method to solve the main problems with a digital money.  Here comes the big issue then, is that early adopters in bitcoin have a vested interest in keeping bitcoin dominant, as do all holders of coin.  And we already have mining equipment built up over several years.  There have been a few projects build off bitcoin that people threw their hashing power at to outright destroy them (LukeJR did this a few times if I recall).
So even if a new system does come up that is better... the vested interests will probably destroy it... and we will stick with bitcoin.  That is unless this new system finds a new way of solving the issues of double spending and a lack of a central authority that does not use proof of work in a way.

Here is how they lend out more money then they have... I deposit 100 dollars, they keep a 10 percent reserve and loan out 90 dollars... that person takes those 90 dollars and puts it in his bank account to spend... that then lets the bank take a 10% reserve of that, 9 dollars, and loan out the 81 left over.
Fractional reserve banking lets banks create money from nothing via those deposits that are made from previous loans.
The thing with fractional reserve banking is they don't have to move cash when they loan the money, they just keep it on their books which lets this system happen.  In a bitcoin bank... you would be able to send the physical cash (because it is so eazy) so there would be no way to create more "money" from nothing.

I think one can already answer that... A gpu will pay off faster but after its paid off will have a lower profit margin.  An ASIC will be paid off slower but over time have a higher profit margin... Are you in it for the short term or the long term?
Also from my understanding an ASIC made for mining would produce less heat, driving down secondary costs.

It totally depends on what bitcoin ends up being.  Is it just used in the black market?  What about international Remittance?  What about as a every day currency for peoples in governments where their currency is not managed honestly?
If it only takes over black market uses, the market cap has a long way to grow, and myself and others see many other uses.
No one knows the answer to your question.  It's like asking how widespread the internet would be in the 1980's.  People knew what it could do, to a degree, but no one really knew what would catch on.

**How and where do I get a Bitcoin wallet?**
If you use Android I recommend Mycelium, I have no idea about the best current Desktop or IOS wallets, although I have used Electrum before.
**How do I trade/earn Bitcoins?**
The same way you Trade/Earn any form of money really... there are some more technical things like mining to "earn" bitcoins but I would stick away from that unless you want to get into it as more of a hobby.
There are also many markets to use bitcoin with, but lots of regular businesses accept bitcoin now.
**Where should I read to find out more/keep me updated?**
I just use Reddit, there are bitcoin specific websites but many of them are pushing a specific agenda, though... many accuse the mods here of pushing a specific agenda as well.
**Do you have some general tips and tricks you use?**
Buy in hold in small amounts, Ignore the hype. Don't get roped into an AltCoin.  There are many scammers, use your head, ask questions and be skeptical.  If you have any other specific questions let me know, I have been around since 2010 in the space.

I suppose you are right to a degree.  To the external network you are not a full node because you are not able to provide a full history of blocks.  But for your own validation, you have at one time seen all blocks and have current proofs to independently validate your transactions.  So for your own uses you are effectively a full node.

I used to watch his show, but stopped when I realized he started covering bitcoin stuff.  Since I knew about bitcoin, I knew he was full of shit when he said specific things, and I then extrapolated and figured he probably just BS's his way through other things, and that is also true.

I would not really recommend a paper wallet anymore depending on what you mean by that.
Does Breadwallet support the HD wallet standard?  12 word recovery phrase?  If so, that to me is the modern standard.  Just make sure whatever you use you are not "Locked in" to their wallet format.

I do not think you could put any real probabilities on anything.  Your claim that bitcoin is "Legit" is also not a safe assumption.  If and when bitcoin becomes a threat to a national currency, look to see if the governments stance toward bitcoin changes.  The power to create money will not be given up easily.

I just gave all my friends and family some amount of bitcoin, between 2010 and 2013, and told them to hold as long as they want, and never ask me for more.  Most lost the wallets, some people sold back in the first bubble for $700 to $1,000 (and then were smug when it crashed and I did not sell).  I think only myself and my former sister in law still hold any coins.

True, but then you lose your physical coin which cost you more then the value of the bitcoins redeamed (ignoring bitcoin value changes).  If they do have a defect, I would want a replacement coin so it could still serve the purpose.

I believe there may not have been any specific reason for the 8 places bitcoins are tracked to.

The issue with micropayments is the fees associated with the transaction.  For some payments... like maybe the payment for reading one article on a pay per view website... the payment would be smaller then the fee.  This means... you basically could not pay for the content.
This new system sets up a contract... where you set up a transaction with a person that holds X bitcoin.  Some amount is set to go to the other person, and some back to yourself.  At any time, one party can modify this contract so more or less goes to each person, and you can agree to it.  Also, the transaction is always valid... so if someone walks away and does nothing.. the payments are sent out.
What this does however, is lets you agree to pay small amounts, over a long time, and have both parties never have to worry about not getting paid or having money stolen.  Say you set up a contract with a future youtube to watch video.  You load the contract with some bitcoin, and then for every X time you watch, your client authorizes more payment.  At some time that transaction is sent and youtube gets your money... and you dident have to waste money on fees sending 1,000 transactions.
I AM NOT 100% ON HOW THIS WORKS!!!! but this is how I understand it.

If you dump coins into a wallet from coinbase, and give them that wallet, they have no assurances you did not keep a copy of that wallet.  That is why it is possibly the worst idea ever, you are giving your customer a shitty product.

Ehh even then.  If you are in it for the long term... maintaining reputation when yo start going downhill will lead to a support network of people trying to help you.  Look at what happened to Ozcoin and all the people that helped out.
If you decide to fuck people over, you are going to have a hard time EVER getting back into the space because people will follow the money, and remember you.  I think every person involved in bitcoin sees the long term potential, especially someone who starts a bitcoin business.  they would be fools to throw away any future opportunities for short term gains.
Also, there is still the fear of if a theft is large enough, someone being motivated enough to develop a tainted coin system that people actually like and support (I hate the idea of tracking coin taint, but it could heppen).

... you bought miners... had to wait forever to get them... and you... in all that time... did not even do the smallest amount of research on mining?
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:57:41
Wat? ...
The bitcoin network, as it were does not care how many transactions there are going on at any one time.  Miners may care, as more transactions presumably means more fees for miners, and better incentive, but the network really does not care.
If we need to handle more transaction volume, more hashing is not the solution, a bigger block size is.  If Block A has 1 transaction in it, and block B has 600, and they both happen at the same difficulty level, they will require the same hashing power and time to solve (on a probabilistic level).
Transactions will always take 10 min to confirm the first time, adding more hashing power will not change this (long term).  If you think 10 min is too long, go try an alt-coin.

"I've also considered implementing a feature where you can lock-in the exchange rate when you begin the escrow process. So if you agree on a price of $200 USD and send the appropriate amount of BTC and the exchange rate drops to $100 a coin I'll make up the difference to ensure you get exactly $200 worth of coin when the escrow process is complete. This would come out of my own pocket. Is this a feature that the community feels would be a benefit?"
Do not do this, for the love of all things good... do not do this.

Most of the issue is that not everyone uses bitcoin yet.  If bitcoin was the currency you bought every day things with, and got paid with, who would need ACH to buy silly dollars...
Merchent services?  like locking in and managing the exchange rate?  USELESS when/if everything is listed in bitcoin.

In online communities a networked rating based reputation system has emerged as the norm as often you do not work with the same person more then once or twice.  Networking this reputation and putting your trust in the greater community is what has brought success to systems like ebay, reddit, and now localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-23 16:09:38
Most people would probably be confused and just import the key, not realizing that what they really need to do is import the key, send the coins to another address, and then clear that keypair from your wallet.
How many novice bitcoin users getting their first bitcoin on localbitcoins would know to do this?  Hell, I wonder if most wallet programs people would be using would let you do all this simply.... where as you COULD just use the transaction service, get credit for the trade, build reputation, make it easier on the buyer, and repay localbitcoins for sending you the business in the first place...
@_date: 2013-10-15 19:23:14
You dont... the value from the coins that was lost gets added to the remaining coins by market forces.

Most bigger miners that I am aware of run headless themselves.  The ASICMINER Block Eruptor Blade you just plug in power and Ethernet, log in via IP, and configure the pool and boom.
I mine with a Pi and 3 block eruptor USB's, just as a hobby.  It works well but make sure you get a powered hub, and that powered hub can supply enough power for the devices.  The Pi can NOT power miners.

The big reason why the proof of work wont change?  Miners have to approve it... Miners are the ones who "vote" and if you do not get the biggest miners to approve, it wont happen.
That... or you would have to hardfork the chain and stick on a lower one... one that would take on the difficulity of the previous chain... and then would fail to progress at the new lack of hash power.
(I may be wrong, but that is how I understand it)

The issue with buying bitcoin points out the flaws in the old banking system, not bitcoin.  With why it is so hard to buy bitcoin, it reinforces the need for a bitcoin like system.

The discussion is that most ASICminer products will be sold in public auction to let the market decide the price... the big thing here is units sold will NOT be preorders... but because of funds raised by shareholders (like myself) we will float the cost and then ship directly after a winning bid is made.

Upon further review, the issues were caused by the site being open in a RES frame.
Still my overall frustration is this...  Why are people who have some ability spending time building duplicate services when there are already so many in the space that do the job better.
If I was going to release a dice site, I would have to have one damn good idea, have some massively low house stake, or some advantage.
Your house edge matches several other sites, your bankroll is far less then most sites, and I do not see any new features.

You do not have to recoup the full cost of purchasing the shares to make a profit... Simply hold the shares till you need the money, keep the dividends and the money you get from selling back the shares.
The other thing you have not taken into account, is transaction fees.  As more day to day purchases are made with bitcoins, more transactions will be made... and with these day to day transactions will demand a fast confirmation... so they will pay fees.  Already transaction fees are a significant part of the reward.
The third part you have not taken into account... is the money from selling hashing equipment.  The 300mh usb miner is, in my opinion, going to be a huge hit that will sell at a premium over cost.  Also, we sold ~700btc worth of hashing equipment this weak in an auction... which should result in a ~.00175 bump to dividends this week.
I agree there is a huge risk, a MASSIVE risk when you look at traditional investing... but in my situation all my bitcoins are meant to be risky investments.  I have half my holdings in bitcoin, and half in bitcoin securities and investments... mostly ASICminer.

Sure.  Each time you get coins sent to an address you control an unspent output is created that can later sent on in another transaction.  Your wallet does not simply deduct a balance from an account, but rather sends out a previous input.  So, because of this, you can send out tainted inputs, and untainted inputs separately.
I do not support coinvalidation in any way, simply stating what is possible.

Another point.... some bitcoiners will probably want to tip the server in BTC, and possibly not fiat.  (I discourage this strongly).  I would advise you to tell your servers to just gladly accept it, and convert it for them if they want.  This lets the bitcoiner feel super cool, and does not force your staff into adoption.
I believe bitpay has something like this built in, but when I tip in btc, I use paper wallets of sorts, ALONG WITH a fiat tip.

... really?  I don't think so...
To the blockchain they are all the same when sent to an address.  And really your wallets made up separation of coins would mean nothing.  The miner who actually process your transaction would go by the blockchain, and just move the coins...  The block chain really cant keep track of that extra bit from what I know, we are already dealing with blockchain bloat issues, if it kept track of that parts of a balance were from where historically forever, the blockchain would be HUGE now, instead it just tracks balances.

Careful, every now and then coinbase randomly for no reason cancels trades, so watch out for that.
I always meet at a McDonalds and only do local in person trades.  McDonalds has been good to me as there is always free internet and there is always other people around.
I bring a counterfeit checking pen and use it to quickly check large piles of cash.  I also randomly check a few bills for security features.
Start small, and then go up.  I would NOT suggest trying to trade online with people, the market for that is much harsher and you will get burned unless you really know what you are doing, and even then...

Miners can take as many or as few transactions as they want, they are however encouraged to process transactions by the fees people include.  This is why you include a fee, so a miner wants to include it in their block.

Do not tell people what to do and not to do with their money?
If NO ONE invested in mining, the bitcoin network would be overly sustainable to a 51% attack.  A healthy investment in mining equates to a healthy bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.  If everyone got out of mining because its going to crash and it is a zero sum game, then your stupid NeoBee would be worthless before it gets off the ground.
It is possible that all miners profit... If the value of bitcoin increases, even shitty GPU's could be profitable again.  Hell, I like mining just because it is a nice way to steadily buy into bitcoin without worrying about day to day price fluctuations, I just pay my electricity bill.  BUT AAHZ, they would be better off just buying BTC, dont mine!  Go back to my first argument, we need miners... more mining == more secure bitcoin.
I agree investing in services is needed, especially services that add liquidity, but what NeoBee is ding seems to be to early in the game.  Sure in the future that is needed, but right now we need liquidity and price stability.  I predict NeoBee getting hosed with their pegged accounts and having to close down.

This often happens when the price is going up fast... people "buy now" and do not put in orders... they worry about getting left behind if they put in a low order and the price outpaces them.
What then happens... is that if the price dips (like it did the last 24 hours) people buy up those cheep coins quickly and we see fast rebounds since there is no floor to fall onto.

Really good points. I bought most my shares around ~.6 to.8 and am only currently using dividends to buy more shares...   I have buy orders in at 1.1 however if it goes that low.  I really expect BFL to fall on its face, and people run to ASIC miner with their refunds (if they get them) considering they already waited... they will not want to wait longer for Avalon.
As of me writing this the last block included ~1.27 btc from transaction fees ( this is actually quite high if I recall... but it is the quickest metric I could get. If memory serves... current transaction fees are usually around 1BTC... and this is with low adoption.  At current growth  I would (with no expert opinion or analysis here) expect that transaction fees will more then make up the difference before the next block halving.  Also, as people spend more and more money on mining equipment... they are going to be less and less likely to accept 0 fee transactions... further increasing this profit.

Post the address (you already did) the message and the signature... then me using my client I can verify the message against the signature to check a hash, and prove that you control the private key that controls the address you claim to own.
Why is this important?  Helps weed out scams. Sure you could still scam me, but at least I know you have the shares, most con artists would probably not hold any shares.

One problem... the people who decide what changes on the bitcoin network go through are those who hold the hashing power, and the people that hold the hashing power have ASIC's.

you should not get any major decrease in pay from a measly 4th added to the network.  Really it would only be a 2.5% decrease in pay.
Having your pool get a huge boost to its hash rate does not hurt you, it just lowers your variance in payout.  What hurts your profit is significant additions to overall network hash rate.

This!  A lot of early people still have their coins in the original addresses from which they were mined.  When you generate coins, they go to a new address....  (I believe this is still true).

every 2016 blocks there is a difficulty adjustment.  If you dumped a massive chunk of hashing power, you would only get those 2016 blocks faster, then the difficulty adjustment would slow you down to a 2 week period for the next 2016 blocks.

If you had a working trading bot, there would be no reason for you to give it out.
You would simply use it, and profit.
The only reason you would not use it yourself, is if you did not have the needed starting capital, in that case you would find investment, not sell the bot.
Please, someone... tell me 1) why you would sell a trading bot that worked. and then 2) if said bot worked, how could multiple work at the same time in the same way, wouldn't they eat out each others margins?
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:20:34
Depends.  If you want to be sure your transaction is safe, and can not be double spent, you should wait for a larger number of confirmations.  Bitcoin QT has you wait for 6, localbitcoins has you wait for 3 other places have you wait for 0.
If you had to wait for 3 confirmations, and someone controlling 10% of the network wanted to mess with you, they would have to find the next 3 blocks in a row, A 0.1% chance of happening I do believe.
So it all depends on how many confirmations both parties have agreed to wait for.

The only "official" way to get them is if you were going to order 50.  There are official resellers, but those depend on where you are living.

You are not wrong.  The profit margins on mining are meant to be thin.  If it ever becomes unprofitable to mine, people will stop mining, making it more profitable for the people who stay.
This is actually really cool in a way... the low margins on mining encourage people to find cheaper electricity, more efficient miners, and better cooling solutions.   Economics drives bitcoin to be as efficient as possible, or you will just lose money.

no... no you are not supposed to discard them after every use.  You can if you wish, at no cost to you, but there is no reason not to use an address multiple times.
If having your public key exposed was any significant security risk, the whole system would crumble.
I could just watch the blockchain for coins to move to an address... then hack that address...  the public broadcasting of transactions would be flags of "look at my money to steal".
Exposing your public key is fine... you fucking have to BROADCAST it to the WHOLE network to spend them anyway!

Someone who wants to sell at the price you want to buy at is matched with you via some process.  With coinbase, they order match internally, have a stash, and do orders on the market to find you the coins.  With bitstamp, since it is just an exchange, they match you with someone at your price.
Everything is just supply and demand.

Yes, but in bitcoinland, reputation and trust are worth more then anything.  At the current moment, ASICMINER makes MORE money from sales then it does from mining.

PPS = Pay per Share
So hopefully you understand that miners get paid when they find a block, they get the block reward (currently 25 btc) and any fees in the transactions they accept for that block (typpically most all transactions that happened since the last block).  When you mine you are basically guessing the solution to a math problem that contains some specific information like the previous block header, and some of the details of possible transactions.  When you find a possible solution that is what I believe is called a share.
Normally a pool counts up how many shares you added to the pool, divides that by how many total shares it took for that pool to find a block.  This means you earn coin every time your pool "gets lucky" and finds a block.
PPS ignores luck... it takes the current round difficulty and figures out what the probability of your share is of finding a block, and then pays you that proportion of a block reward minus a fee.  What is the benefit of this?  NO variance.  You will get a steady stream of BTC to your account... but at the cost of a fee.  With the normal payment OVER TIME you will earn more... but you could have periods of low income and high income.

So, a business is going to save money on cash handling fees and credit card fees if they accept bitcoin... so as you stated they directly benefit.  Where you the consumer benefit is when those businesses offer a discount on their product to encourage you to use one payment method over another.
Already several places offer a cash discount to try and avoid credit card fees.
The other benefit besides that, is being able to transfer money from one place to another.  Bitcoin ignores borders, and has low fees... which makes it great for the international remittance market.  The issue here however is the liquidity of bitcoin and transferring it the the local currency.
Right now it is still early in the game, so many of the benefits of bitcoin are not yet realized... and most bitcoin purchases are speculative.

Any unit of bitcoin can have any valuation.  One bitcoin could be worth .000001 cents or 1,000,000 dollars... there are no limits.
Entropy and heat death are issues for the universe because there are finite limits to things, and infinite space.
We can keep cutting bitcoins up forever, to smaller and smaller pieces, and to those pieces, we can be attributed any value by the market.
You simply do not understand the topic, but understand this,  Loss of bitcoins is not a threat to bitcoin as a whole, but only the individual who lost them.

Sure the coins in cold wallets would be safe... but is it possible to maintain any level of utility if all public keys must be kept secret along with all private keys?

Don't even need to do this... by denying the market coins... you have increased their value over ALL HOLDERS of coins by reducing the supply on the market.

And... 1k btc is ~ 1/3rd of that entire depth.   You would tank the market.
Why ANYONE would launder btc by selling and buying on the market into other currencies boggles the mind.  AML and KYC compliance of the exchanges would kill you right off the bat, or possibly worse, get other people in trouble.
You could simply move the btc around with other coins for the .0001 btc fee you would end up taking on each round, and avoid the % fees markets would take for each move.
People forget, you cant track individual coins.  Only balances.  It would be trivial for me to take coins with 100% taint and get them down to sup 10% levels in no time, with a fee of less then .001 btc.

Step 1) Print off SECURE paper wallets (I like 
Step 2) Make sure whatever master wallet you are using can scan QR codes.
Step 3) At point of sale, scan the QR code on a new wallet, deposit the proper amount of btc and exchange for cash with customer.
This is how I plan to sell BTC to most people who are purchasing it for investment.
I must ask however, why do you think you need to assign a key to a customer... I would expect most knowledgeable customers to not trust you and come to you with their own key for which they expect you to pay into.  There will ALWAYS be a security issue if the coins you get are given to you not by a transaction in the blockchain, but the handing over of a private key.

1) I do believe you are correct!
2) Yes, you would fork the blockchain and there would be two independent versions of bitcoin.  The idea is that once one side lost, they would abandon the smaller chain and join the larger chain because of the network effect.
This is also why mining pools are... interesting.  You are letting someone vote for you.
3) Such a change would devalue bitcoin as a whole, and I believe would hurt everyone, not just early adopters.
4) I suppose, but why would nodes reject a change that is in their best interest?
5) Yes possibly... but think of this.  Lets say I require a fee of .0002.  Yes I will be getting more per transaction in fees, but if the majority of people are only paying .0001 and another miner will gladly take those, the miner who is asking for a lower fee will make more in fees by having more transactions to take fees from.  To "Hold hostage" transactions to pay fees, you need a good majority of miners to agree to a higher fee to inconvenience users enough where they are persuaded to pay more.

Not all P2P networks are created equal.  Torrents are better at spreading large files around.  Currently when you download the blockchain you do it in order and one block at a time from one peer.  This will be changing in new versions of bitcoin, but right now... torrents are the way to go to initially download the bulk of the blockchain.

Your best bet is to buy from ASICminer.  There is a usb unit for 1.99BTC that hashes at 300Mh/s and a blade unit for 50btc that hashes at 10Gh/s.
To order a larger unit go here: 
The smaller units are sold in batches of 300 from ASICMINER... there are "group buys" available... and some re-sellers may have purchased batches... you should see some available on the open market in the next week.  To join a "group buy" look here: 
I am biased towards ASICMINER as I hold shares... but as of right now ASICMINER is the only way (i know of) to order an ASIC and get it in any reasonable amount of time... BFL is 6+ months behind on shipments, and AVALON has yet to announce another preorder phase, and is also behind on shipping.

This was EARLY in bitcoin REAL FUCKING EARLY.  I had just heard of it and turned my CPU onto mining.  Checked it a few hours later and lucky me I had mined 3 blocks!
Issue was... my wallet says I still had 0 coins... I figured I had a bad install and wiped everything, made a new wallet and started again and went to sleep, next day I had mined 1 block and had the 50 coins happy day.
In retrospect what happened was I did not wait for the 120 blocks needed to confirm my mined coins... some of those blocks may have been orphan blocks, or they could have been real... I like to think they are real, and I fucked up!
If you are wondering... no I don't have thousands of coins... after I mined that one block I got bored of bitcoin for... about a year or so till I read an article and found my old wallet... stupid me right?

Actually node propagation does not matter directly.  If one transaction was propagated to less nodes, but those nodes solved a block first, that transaction wins.  The probability is that the transaction that gets to the most node first wins, but may not be the case.

It would be hard to have it store the coins... you would need to scan and edit the blockchain to some degree... or manually pass it exactly what outputs to use from a known privkey.  The main goal of this device seems to be its ease of use, having it preload the wallets either totally kills its security, or totally kills its ease of use.
WHY would it NEED to use Hierarchical wallets?  I see this being used as a way to hand out bitcents at events... or for when someone goes to meet up for a bitcoin sale and does not want to have more on them then they need to.  I do not see this as a way someone manages a huge wallet portfolio... thermal paper?  Even with 7 years... thermal paper?

Lets take it simply... you achieve the same level of coin masking by depositing coins into an exchange, and then simply withdrawing them back out as you would by converting them around and then withdrawing them.  This avoids fees, exchange risk, having to try and pull off a pump and dump.

TBH I was not expecting the verification!
I would first go out and secure the services of JohnK on Bitcointalk.  He is a trusted escrow service and for a transaction of this size I would say there are only a few more trusted people to go to, but JohnK is the obvious first choice for most.
John himself may be able to point you directly to someone who would be willing to buy.
If you can not find a single buyer via TradeHill or from some contact John may or may not have, I would try going on to Bitcoin OTC and seeing if you can get a group of buyers to buy you out.  Many people on OTC would be able to sell the BTC for you, to others in smaller amounts.  All of this would require you selling the coin some value under current prices to accommodate a margin for the re-sellers to profit.
If you end up not being able to find a single buyer, and do need multiple smaller buyers to take coin off your hands and then further distribute it, I could be one of them.  I have started getting several requests to from people to buy bitcoin in my local area, and the number is always growing.
I would however encourage you to be careful.  The tax implications of unloading this much coin will be... insane depending on where you live.

basically the way the network remains secure, is that it is distributed among thousands of miners, and they work together to decide if a transaction is valid or invalid and other such things.  Because it is based on consensus in a way... if someone controls 51% of the power in the network they can just ignore the rules and double spend coins and the like.
The reason new currencies would have issues with this, is they would not yet have a large network of miners.  Bitcoin already has MASSIVE computing power behind it, and is much harder to take over in this method... also... when anyone gets close (you will often see people complain about BTCGuild) Everyone freaks out and solves the problem fast.
This is probably not a fully accurate description, as I don't fully understand the technical side of it... but this is how I understand it.

@_date: 2013-04-22 13:19:11
Here is one... The major solution to many problems in a virtual currency was the proof of work and block chain system... If a new system tries to start up, and it ends up having to rely on this type of system... bitcoin users will attack it.
This has already happened a few times, and it happens less now because developers realized their work would be futile.  Basically people that have a vested interest in bitcoin, and that have a reasonable amount of mining hardware... preform 51% attacks on the new currencies network and cripple it.
I remember this happened once where LukeJR himself crashed an entire new currency because he felt it was not worth peoples time... and he wanted people to give up on it before it failed naturally (If I recall)

Do not mine with your computer at 50mh/s  You will spend more in electricity then you will earn in bitcoin.  Chances are that actually you would never earn any bitcoin actually... as most pools have a minimum payment amount and it would take you several months to build up the needed amount.
How much are you looking to spend on a miner?
The cheepest ASIC at the moment is the ASICMINER USB Eruptor at 1 btc each.  Asicminer is also the ONLY company that does not have a waiting list, or requires you to preorder.
I am biased to Asicminer because I am part owner of the company.

The block does not generate a number of transactions, miners group transactions that are pending up into a possible block, hash that, include the hash of the previous block, and then try to solve the block and broadcast it to the network.
Users decide what fees they want to include, miners choose to accept that transaction as it is, or ignore and let it sit pending.
The difficulty of block discovery is dependent on hashing power on the network, and is not (to my knowledge) effected in any direct way by the number of transactions.
Miners can "Name their price" for fees, but as I said... if you set the threshold too high, you are leaving fees on the table for the next miner.  In many situations people who accept lower fee transactions would make MORE then people who require more fees.
Does that help?

This is not correct... the "genesis" block is the first block in the chain, he does not pay from that 50 coin block.  HE DOES however pay from the generated block...  the block he mines is split directly to the miners (or it was back when I mined with him.)
The cost of this is having to wait for 120 confirmations before you can spend your coins.

Basically your money is gone...
TradeFortress was able to pay interest on bitcoin deposits in coinlenders by investments mostly in Asicminer and JustDice.  Near about the same time, both were hit hard... and right then inputs/coinlenders were insolvent.  Previously he had guaranteed all deposits with his own stash of bitcoin, but his losses were so great that he could not manage them.  So he claimed he was hacked, and ran with what little there was left.
I have no hard evidence for these statements, but if you look into his post history around the community, and If you followed him for several years, you would probably come to the same conclusion.
ANY service that offers you "interest" on your deposits, figure out how they are going to pay you, and what risks they are taking.
Vircurex for example pays interest on deposits as a portion of trading fees, this seems stable.  They figure the more coins stored there, the more trades there... the more trades there the more interest they can pay, the more interest they pay the more coins they can get to be stored there, a good logical and stable cycle.

Yes... I do, Why?  Because I am a serious investor and that is what I do.  The fixed costs of AM are small in terms of overall money brought in.  If BTC/USD got REALLY low to where the costs ate up a significant % of the BTC we mined, then YES I would care about USD/BTC.  At the moment that is not the case, and figuring in USD value adds unnecessary complication for little added utility in profit calculations.
Same thing with mining on an ASIC.  The electricity costs are minimal, your big worry is if the cost of the miner you buy in BTC, will earn you more BTC then its initial purchase price.  That is the main calculation, is USD/BTC a factor?  Yes... but with the electrical cost being so small its not worth considering tooo much unless things change drastically.

So I went to ZeroBlock to try you out... ever since I heard about you on LTB I have been watching for your release.
... I wonder if this is going to actually work.  I clicked on a link to send a payment directly and the payment to view the article was 0.000081
That... Is about 1/5th of what I usually pay for a transaction fee.
How do you plan to avoid huge transaction file sizes when you combine 100 inputs to be able to send a transaction of any meaningful value?  When currently bitcoin users consider a .0001 transaction fee the norm, and so do miners, how are payments lower then that amount viable?
To me it seems you are going to need to use off blockchain transactions, or just suffer.
Then again, is this use case going to be the breakthrough for bitcoin?  Do we as a community need to lower the fee we accept to enable both micropayments and the 3rd world to be able to use bitcoin?  What would lowering the fee to a smaller amount do to miners who are going to rely on that for income in the future according to the original whitepaper?  Possibly worse... what would lowering the fee do to re-introduce people spamming transactions and cluttering the blockchain which people already fear is going to be an issue with current standards.

Because at the time bitcoin was not worth much... but it was early.

I bought most of my coins at.... 0 I CPU mined them 3 years ago when they worth .001 cents or less.
Dont tell me, after going from .001 cents to $140 in 3 years... doubling every 6 months "Cant Happen"
If you honestly think that, you are an IDIOT.
I am not going to quit my job... but its minimum wage... so I would not lose much.
I am already cost neutral, got allll of my initial investment back... and have already pulled several thousand out to more traditional investments "just in case".  But when I look back at ALL the coins I have lost through stupidity, or sales... well... its fustrating.

Because the size of the pool does not determine your payout?  The size of the network does.  Pool size effects frequency and volatility.
Also because the pool that was mentioned is a measley portion of total network hashing power.
Lets say you are in a pool that controls 33% of the network. And you are 100% of the hashing power in your pool. Typically that will mean your pool will earn 2 blocks per hour, and you yourself will earn 2 block per hour worth of coins because you are the whole pool.
Lets say that now, someone decides to leave their pool and join yours.  They bring the pool to 66% of the network!  OH NO! now you only have 50% of the hashing power in your pool?  WHAT HAPPENS?!!!  Nothing... to your payout amount on average.
You will still have 33% of the network hashing power, and still earn about two blocks of coins per hour.
THE SIZE of your pool effects the VARIANCE/FREQUENCY of earning coins, not the AMOUNT.  Your hashing power compared to OVERALL NETWORK hashing power is what determines your payout.
I was involved in bitcoin when pools started... the reason they started was people did not like the fact that they may or may not get coins this week/month... it depended on luck.  By pooling their hashing power, they still overall got the same number of coins on average, they  just got less coins per block because they were sharing blocks, but because they were sharing/pooling they more consistently found blocks and had a more constant influx of coins.
The PPS model of pooled mining payouts FURTHER make it so you have a standard, low variance payout you can count on.
If you have further bitcoin related questions, feel free to ask... as it seems you don't really grasp some of the concepts.

Well, there is the fact that there are probably several people who have the exact same fingerprint as you, and fingerprints are a horrible form of biometric identification, hence why this ATM does not use fingerprints.
Not only that, but this ATM does not store your palm vain in the way you may think. I do not fully understand it, and have not researched it fully, but I believe the machine stores the equivalent of a hash of the data, not the data itself.  So they can use it to identify you, but that is about it...
Furthermore, in this age of surveillance, if anyone wanted your fingerprint, or other similar biometric information on you, they could get it.

Waiting to buy is a bad idea...
The price goes up and down, and some people day trade on this, but overall keep in mind that OVERALL, ON AVERAGE (no guarantee of future performance) the value of bitcoin is going up.  So the sooner you buy, the better you are then someone who buys in later then you.  THIS IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE!!!! the guy who bought in at 266 probably feels like an idiot, but there are far fewer of him then people who wished they would have purchased sooner!

What body is going to impose these regulations? and what?  Not only that... but how does regulation stop hackers?  I don't get it.  Is saying "it is illegal to hack a bitcoin exchange for profit" going to stop someone?  I think not...

The first block was never mined, it was just hard coded into the client.

Yep, one more reason to abandon them.

There are several projects, the largest of which is probably the bitcoin change conversion briefcase that was seen at the last DefCon.  The people behind it are not working on modifying the unit to add features.

Interesting... Asicminer announced .2W/GH recently, will be interesting to see who wins.
The other interesting thing, is Asicminer has innovative liquid cooling solutions... 
Yep, im totally biased towards Asicminer XD

Not much can be done, especially if that site is the one who had the address... how could you possibly recover coins from a private key you never knew/had access to?

he did not mess up a raw transaction, he messed up debiting an account balance because he was focused, and successfully, did a raw transaction.

Go support coin forest.... I do because of what you suggest.

Uhhhhhh..... really?  From what I have seen Satoshi was above all and in every way a better coder then Gavin.

I can help you through the process.. ask questions?

There is a torrent of the blockchain!  
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:07:02
No one will really comply with this, just give up now.  Bitcoin refers to the currency, and a specific unit.  Bitcoin network refers to the protocol.  
I will send you some bitcoins using Bitcoin just sounds stupid and redundant.

Not really, live pets are public... and if you know a betid you can look at any old bet, but you can not look at a specific users bets.  I believe the reason for this is so people do not have have to worry about others judging them, or begging from them, if they are up or down a lot.  But you kind of know how is doing well and not if you hang out in the chat all day XD

Ignore all speculation, wait for friedcat to say something.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:22:59
Bitcoins can be devided up to 8 decimal places... more if we wanted to change the system (which is possible) as long as ANY bitcoins remained, we could just split them up as much as we like, the market would adjust the value and life would go on.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:06:44
The benefit of a service like BCTip is that they link you to information on bitcoin, and get you started with a web wallet like coinbase.
Try having your first bitcoin experience be importing a privkey into a wallet.  Yes it can be easy, but... lots of people have trouble with just setting up a basic wallet (as evident by questions i get asked).
@_date: 2013-09-15 14:12:00
... Gavin is doing fine.
If Gavin wanted more pay, he could get it.  I would assume if his pay is that low, he is the one that wanted it that way.

Yes, miners do not change the data.  But the data being sent to miners is simply move w coins from x address to y address and put remainder in z... keep the change.  They do not have a parameter for looking back further to see where the coins came from and selecting "specific" coins from a balance, they only care that the send address has the balance.
Since coins are just balances in an account, how can you keep dirty and clean separate? If you have an address with .5 of a clean coin, and I send you .5 of a dirty coin.  You now have a 50% tainted coin.  There is no way (that I know of) to send .5 of a coin to someone and have that coin be 100% clean.  The only thing you could do i mix it with further clean coins to reduce taint.
I must be missing something, how can a wallet separate clean and dirty coins?  You seem to both agree with me, and yet disagree with me, there must be something I am missing here.

InB4 marketing ploy.

Since there is no central authority on bitcoin, there is no "official symbol"  Some people disagree on what the symbol should be.
Most people use they symbol for the baht ฿

Came here to buy a cake with bitcoin, realize I would only learn to make a cake that took more time and effort to make then would be worth for something turned into poop within 24 hours... and I wouldn't be paying for the supplies to make said cake.  I am disappoint.
But good on you for accepting bitcoin!

Lets talk about nodes... what is the "simplist" thing I could run a full node on?  I did some research a while back and I could not find out if I could run a full node on a RPI.
I already run a full node on my main PC, but lately I can really feel when it is working away, maybe it is just people pulling the blockchain from me, but I would love to maintain a full node, just not on my main computer.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:32:55
So hear me out...
Money and Power go hand in hand.  Having a small weak currency is no good, and can lead to many issues as we have seen before.  But as a small country what are your options?
You can try and peg your currency, but that can be really hard to keep up.  You can latch onto another countries currency, but that lets them have a lot of power over you.  You can pull your currency with others, lets see how the euro is doing.
But now, you can accept bitcoin!  You retain your independence, you are not giving control to anyone else, and you have all the other benefits of bitcoin.
Now that there is the market cap to absorb these other smaller currencies... it will likely happen.  And as each country falls in line, it grows the cap allowing for more expansion, with one other thing to note....
Countries that get in early, benefit the most!  Are we about to see these smaller 3rd world countries catapulted out of poverty by early adoption?

Search your computer for a wallet.dat file, located in the bitcoin directory in AppData.
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:49:29
Well... it is always possible to lose data... 
As long as one person had a record of the chain however, the network could recover.  Some thin clients only keep block hedders, or some other subset of the full blockchain, but I imagine most nodes like myself hold a full copy of the blockchain.
If everything works as intended in the current implementation of bitcoin, no... no data will be forgotten.

Is the 7 transactions a throttle?  I thought that figure came from max block size divided by average transaction size divided by 10min.
Also, every miner must be a node, with the understanding that pools act as a single miner and if you mine with a pool, you yourself are not mining per say.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:29:05
2 seconds of research leads me to this topic... 
why not open your eyes next time?
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:18:56
Figure out how much you want to buy... split that money into X parts... buy coins every day for X days.  This will not get you the "best" deal on coins... but it will make sure you do not get "the worst" deal.

I know you mention on your site that your ASICminer share cards are unauthorized... but you should really get with friedcat and let him know what you are doing.
Some day in the future... I imagine he will be moving all shares to some sort of exchange and move away from the system of having them assigned to one address and manually updating the holders database... in the event of this someone who bought a card and locked it away would be... fucked.
Good on you however for including a GMail address with the card.
Can you post pictures of the actual card?  As it would be recieved and as it would look when opened?
Right now you look like a scam to me... no pictures of actual product... just nice looking pictures.  Not only that but the multiple posts praising you when you have yet to actually show anything... seems like they may be people associated with you.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:07:02
.... if they would sell at $1,000, would it not just stabilize at 1,000?  If the price dips down, they stop selling... price goes back up they sell?
I do not agree with you, but I am pointing out why you are wrong in how you are thinking.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:19:59
Yeah... what did happen?  I have a bitbill i use as a cold wallet.  I went to buy more a while back because I liked them and they were gone!
