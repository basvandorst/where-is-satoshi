It's mostly about not being enough wealth/value on the planet to support such an increase. I think the endgame with bitcoin is around $700k in today's money. Can't really go much higher unless there's massive population growth.

Agreed, that vague description applies to nearly every financial instrument, down to savings accounts.
To me what separates gambling from investing is how the entity controlling the system ("the house") has explicit contingencies in place to ensure the user loses more often than they win.

Depends what's your rate for electricity. These consume ~325W AFAIK so you'd be consuming 7.8 KWh/day or $0.94/day (at the average 0.12$/KWh US rate) and generate about 81 satoshis/day (so about half a satoshi per 10 minutes) or $0.01/day. 
In other words you'd be losing $0.93/day. As it's often the case, you're better off just buying BTC.

I agree that securing the network is totally justifiable. Every bit of individual mining help keep the network decentralized.

You got that backwards. There's no point in mining solo with low hashpower as you have little to no chance of solving a whole block by yourself. By mining in a pool you get paid for all your hashes.

He'll know your public address and using that he could potentially track you down. For instance if you made a public post on social media that associates your identity with that address or any address that's connected to it.
Honestly if you're concerned about privacy, consider making the transaction using one of the privacy-focused alts like Monero or Dash, then convert the received funds to BTC. Makes it essentially impossible to track you down.

Depending on where you look at, past the equilibrium price, there's a lot more sell orders at moon-high prices (100k+) than there are buy orders at bottom-of-the-barrel prices (like $300). To me that signals a bias towards a bullish market, but that's just my armchair financial analysis.

I think most people just don't understand how little the chances are of "hitting jackpot". This is basically like checking every drop of water in the ocean one by one, and hoping one of them contains a grain of sand shaped like Elon Musk's head.
Mining with these old, slow miners with the hope of winning the lottery is akin to trying to bruteforce private addresses by trying every character combination possible using a single laptop. It might happen some day, but you'll be dead, buried, the lizard people will have taken over and then the lobster people too.

If you know what you're doing, only the one about the exchanges and *maybe* the one about hardware wallets are good.
Buying from reputable platforms isn't bad per se, but it exposes you to government control as most of them ask for an ID check. Once you send them that picture of yourself holding your driver's license or passport, you've broken k-anonymity and the public addresses you will be using on the platform are linked to your personal identity. Authorities can then track all your Bitcoin. If you don't like this, look for platforms that are reputable but don't require an ID-check.
Why would you need 2-factor if you're not keeping your Bitcoin on exchanges? Ideally you should keep most of your funds in cold storage, and two-factor won't be of any help there. And if you're keeping your day-to-day coin on a hardware wallet, it wont be of any use there either.

TBF gold is a kind of inconvenient to deal with. You either buy it from a Forex trading platform (and have to trust the service provider), buy bars/coins from reputable sellers and have to pay for shipping + storage, or mine/scavenge/recycle it yourself and end up with the burden of proving its purity.
Bitcoin eliminates all of these issues.

Inappropriate word lists are actually pretty hard to implement. It's easy enough to come up with a dictionary of bad words, but quite challenging to detect all the variations and character permutations. Blocking 'bitch' is easy, '61TCh' not so much, especially with Unicode and its large supply of similar looking characters. So what devs usually do is use an algorithm that tests for words proximity (like Levenshtein distance, trigram, Jaro-Winkler), which explains the bitcoin thing.

If the image isn't publicly posted it's probably safe enough. Even if it was available publicly, the chances that someone scans pictures to look specifically for seeds encoded in the same format as yours and finds it are so low they might as well type random characters to try and guess your private key. Most people who get their coins stolen do stupid stuff like installing pirated software on the PC they handle their Bitcoin with, or leaving their coins on exchanges.

It means researching the platform before you blindly trade on it. Looking up who the owners are, how are their financials, trying to figure out their intentions, working out how much time they've been in business, asking around about the experience of past/current users. You basically want to avoid dealing with an exchange that will run away with your money, keep your money locked down for days preventing you from getting the spot price you want, or downright going bankrupt.

For sure, but it's usually more than just the miner fee. I have yet to see a situation where the Bitpay fee is higher than the miner fee + BTC deposit fee + exchange fee + USD withdrawal fee.

I understand that and can see the appeal, but very little of it is helpful for long-term storage. It does help people be more secure with their day to day usage of Bitcoin, but as you mentioned, it still requires you to have your seed written down and protected by other means.

I don't know, maybe it is, this has been up for debate since the inception of Bitcoin. Personally I don't think any asset that just allows its value to freely fluctuate according to supply/demand  and is not pegged to some kind of basic human needs (like a basket of goods) can act as a currency. I really don't believe Bitcoin in its current form will ever be a currency and I'm fine with that.
What specific change do you see that will turn bitcoin into an actual usable currency and not a speculative asset class?

Exactly. One of the reason why the Bitcoin value went up is *because* people spent it. If everyone just hodled and that guy didn't buy two pizzas for 10k BTC, the value would've never increased.
I absolutely agree with the sketchiness too. Back then Bitcoin seemed about as legitimate as the sketchiest altcoin is today. The vast majority of people thought it was a scam.

Exactly, also if Binance were to go bankrupt you'd most likely get nothing at all.
Traditionally, banks are insured via the FDIC, which ensures that if the bank goes belly up, its creditors (that includes clients who had money in the bank) get some of the liquidation money (whatever remains after selling all assets of the failed bank). No crypto exchange is insured in that way currently.

Fair point, but the chances of winning the solo mining lottery are about the same as the chances of winning actual lottery multiple times in a row. On average he'd need to mine for 15.5 million days (42 thousand years) to get the block reward.
On a pool it'd take a really long time to get to the min payout limit, but at the current difficulty it's possible within 3 years.
All of this assumes the diff doesn't increase of course. Realistically, neither is a good option.

More than 15 exchanges were hacked or went bankrupt, some of them major (MtGox being the biggest), resulting in the loss of over a million Bitcoins (not dollars, Bitcoins).
You're free to do whatever you want, but IMHO this is a fairly massive (and unnecessary) risk.

You could also do it via etching. Muriatic acid (pool acid) mixed with hydrogen peroxide is readily available and will eat through most metals like it's butter. Just write your private keys on a metal plate with a Sharpie then let it sit in the acid bath for a few hours. This is how at-home printed circuit boards are made.

There's no benefit to exchanging Bitcoin for a GPU vs exchanging Bitcoin for fiat then fiat for a GPU, you're just adding extra steps and paying extra for the services of a middleman! 
You can look at your story the other way around: Any fiat money you spent in 2016 could've been invested in Bitcoin and it would've been (most probably) a massively better investment than whatever you got instead. So why not obsess over that? Or better yet realize that all of this is in your head. Don't focus on Bitcoin or fiat money or gold or real estate. You have to see all the stuff in your life as value that flows around, just like Neo sees the Matrix.
2016-you worked out that $600 was pretty high for a digital asset, so he decided to sell. You did your risk analysis based on whatever past financial experiences you had and that's the important part. Bitcoin could've tanked hard, and you would've been pretty happy that you bought a GPU instead of hodling like an idiot. Of course it went the other way around, so use that experience to see what you could've done differently and try to do better this time.

The most important thing is to get them off the exchange **ASAP**. Keeping coins on an exchange is probably the least secure storage method short of printing your keys and displaying them at a Bitcoin conference.
Once out of there, transfer them to an address you generated yourself and no one else had access to. There's plenty of tutorials, but the most important part is to generate the address on a freshly set up, uncompromised system (no malware) that never went online, using reasonably audited, open source tools. Offline bitaddress.org on Live Ubuntu USB is great for that. Don't get on the Internet. Just boot the OS, run bitaddress, generate the address, write it down (preferably by hand), and then format/zero-write/drill/incinerate the flash drive.
Keep that address on some sort of future-proof media. Some people do it on paper then put it in a fireproof box, some engrave on metal, some rely on redundancy (make multiple copies and store them at different locations).
Hardware wallets like Trezor are overrated IMHO and more of a convenience product. They have too many failure points for long term storage and security. You wanna think like the Incas/Egyptians/Romans and have your keys on something basic that can survive thousands of years without even thinking about it.

This graph is somewhat fallacious TBF.
Of course, the buying power of the USD has dropped, but that's absolutely intentional considering that the USD was designed to actually circulate and encourage citizens to contribute to society. The only people affected by this "loss" are those who kept USD under their bed and didn't create any wealth or value.
Within the last 62 years the S&amp;P 500 had an average yearly return of 10%, meaning that if, instead of hodling like an idiot, an individual put their USD to work in the stock market, their dollar amount would've grown by over 36500%, far offsetting the 95% drop in purchasing power of the USD itself.
In other words, if you had a dollar back in 1957 when the S&amp;P 500 was founded, and you invested it in the stock market, you'd have ~365$ in 2013, or about 18.25$ in 1913 dollars.
Of course, that's only considering the S&amp;P500. The NYSE was founded in 1792 so there were a lot of opportunities to put your USD to work before that.
