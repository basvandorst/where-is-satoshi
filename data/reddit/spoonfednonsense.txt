The reason behind the misspelling is most likely because it's not real lemonade and cannot claim the name.
Most likely a synthetic Chinese copy cat, as it looks like they out source their "lemonaid" production, by lack of present equipment and production supplies.

No worries, errrm I guess the reason I pay for things with fiat is because I believe in the long term value of Bitcoin... So I feel like acquiring goods and services with it is a waste. 
Unless I purchase something, and immediately rebuy the same amount of BTC.
For instance  let's you pay with BTC, however I choose money order, because they don't offer enough of a discount to make parting with my Digital Treasure worth it.

Gotcha makes sense, yeah I did my big purchase via ACH, but I wanted to try just day trading on a small ammount and try to gain 1-2% a day for practice, so I did it instantly. 
Lesson learned.

Funny because they didn't have a problem keeping good on the exchange rate of 1100+ that I BOUGHT on the same day. 
Seems they change the narrative to fit their story.

Greenhouses have efficient HVAC systems to cool these systems during the day.
His business custom grows produce and delivers it for free, you pay half of what the grocery stores charge.
His business has a deal with 30 hospitals for weekly deliveries, 2000 people have signed up for his service.
He lived in China for several years and can 'kinda' speak the language
Greenhouses can grow from 44F to 110F in almost any wavelength, humidity, nutrient mix, etc.
He owns several biotech companies
He's a mathematician who went to school for 'quantum organic chemistry'
His farm is running an s9 miner
He worked for 5 years at the UCSD super computer center
He's a physician who once wanted to practice outpatient surgery in a his own clinic in Mexico
He has a lab at UCSD"

I'm curious what standard of proof will be required to prove you either do or don't have bitcoin. 
For instance I lost coin in the HashOcean cloud mining ponzi. I wonder if I can claim that as a loss. 
Interested to see what the future holds for bitcoin and regulation. !Remindme 1 year

But will it?
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:05:42
I prefer when it is called The Bitcoin, makes it seem more important and unique 
@_date: 2017-01-23 11:14:03
But... I don't want to sell my coins. Even if it was a good spread.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:35:29
So confused, what did I miss. Someone bet you 1000 bitcoins you couldn't start a solar mining farm?
@_date: 2017-01-12 14:40:47
The way I see it my dollar just went up, and BTC stayed the same. A hope for a better future.

Let's say you had a billion dollars worth Bitcoin. And you wanted to double it.
You would fork your Bitcoin. So you had twice as much. You would keep holding your real Bitcoin. And than you would pump up your fake forked Bitcoin as much as possible so you could make your billion dollars, into 2 dollar dollars.
