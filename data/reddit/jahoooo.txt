Are you actually convinced you're being watched or that there's someone out to get you? I'm sorry if this is a complete misinterpretation on my part, and it's obviously easy to misinterpret over the internet, but having some experience working with people with mental disorders and from reading your post and your comments I'm getting a strong impression that you may have an early onset of psychosis.   
   
Have you noticed anything strange or a bit off in your thought patterns, convictions or behaviour recently. Like something you'd not think or do few months ago? If so I'd recommend seeking medical consultation or at least getting a reality check from someone close to you. An early diagnosis will usually get you better in no time.

There are many, but I think the three most important ones when it comes to Bitcoin are resilience, security and consensus:   
   
- With decentralised system there's no single point of responsibility. If the governments wanted to shut bitcoin down there is no person or a business they can go to and tell them to turn it off. There is no a single entity they can sue or prosecute.   
   
- With decentralised system there is also no a single point of failure. It you're running something on a server it can be hacked or shut down. With a decentralised network there is no single physical  point to attack.   
   
- With decentralised governance all decisions are based on the consensus of the majority, between parties often with conflicting interests. With centralised system there is a single entity responsible for making all decisions. They can make good decisions or bad, but they can also be bribed or blackmailed or work in best interest of a particular minority. In decentralised system the majority always wins.

@_date: 2018-03-17 14:24:18
This has to do with psychology of market behaviour. Let's say you bought BTC at 8000 thinking it will go up, but instead the trend changed direction and the price went down. Now you want to sell, but you also don't want to be at loss, so you're thinking as soon as it goes back to 8k I'm selling. Most of the traders who bought at 8k think the same - this is how resistance is created, i.e. a certain price where a lot of people want to sell.   
   
On the other hand you might have sold BTC at 8k thinking this is as high as it's going to go, but it continues up. Now you're thinking, oh shit we're mooning I need to buy more, but then you don't want to buy for more you've already sold for, so you're thinking when it goes back to 8k I'm buying more. This is how support price is created.   
   
This is also where moving averages come into the picture. For example you want to buy Bitcoin but you don't want to overpay. So you may look at 200 days MA, which will tell you what is the average price people paid for 1 BTC in the last 200 days. And that is where you would place your order. Similarly if you want to sell, the MA will tell you how much on average people got for 1 BTC during the last x days and place your sell order accordingly.

I'm really glad I saved up some fiat for this occasion!
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:13:22
Not really. Let's say you want to make a transaction worth $100 million. If Bitcoin is worth a dollar you can't. If it was $5 you'd need an entire supply of Bitcoin to make that transaction. If it's $500,000 you only need 200 BTC.   
   
Now I can't find a total volume of financial transactions worldwide, but for currency trading only it is over $5 trillion daily. Let's conservatively estimate that a total volume of all transactions is double that, i.e $10 trillion. For bitcoin to be able to be used in 5% of those transactions it's value would have to be at least   $500,000. And this doesn't even include its uility as store of value which could double this estimation.
Another thing to look at is the cost of mining a bitcoin. It currently costs around $6000 to mine one, which, with current price, makes it profitable for the miners. As the difficulty increases with time, the cost of mining the last bitcoin is going to be around $1 million.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:34:56
I stopped buying when Bitcoin crossed $5000 (6 months ago) as I thought it's growing too fast. Not sure where you've got year and a half from as it was relatively cheap prior to September last year. My average price is around $500, but even if I did continue to DCA during the last 6 months it would be around $2000 making around 400% ROI at this point, so still way ahead of index funds. Why are you so angry?

3. Pump alts (alts prices go up vs BTC up while BTC stabilises)   
4. Sell alts for more Bitcoin (BTC goes even higher, alts tank)   
5. Dump BTC for fiat (BTC goes down, alts go down)   
6. Rinse and repeat   
7. Profit

That would be a pretty questionable policy. Those sceptical about Bitcoin would be left even more strengthened in their beliefs and would go to share them somewhere else. And those who read the comment before it was deleted could assume there must have been some validity to it based on mods reaction.   
   
It seems a much wiser policy would be to allow others vote on the comment and present counter arguments which could convince the poster to change their view and let the readers decide what to believe. That's how most of Reddit works anyway.   
   
Besides, there are tons of shitty troll comments which literally add nothing to discussion like "We're going to $100" and "Bitcoin's dead" left untouched, so it seems pretty inconsistent.

Well that's pretty much how every coins subreddit works. Bitcoin's not even the worst, but at least you don't see such heavy moderation in other subs. I'd rather have my comment downvoted and ridiculed than downright removed.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:20:07
Well, not entirely. Firstly to be able to say if we're in a bear or a bull market you need a definition of what that is. In stocks bear and bull markets are usually defined as a continuous movement of price in one direction over a period of 1 or 2 months. Since Bitcoin is a much more volatile asset this definition doesn't necessarily apply, so perhaps you could say we're in a bear market if the price drops continuously for two weeks. In that case you could say we have been in a bear market.   
   
Regardless of the definition though it is actually possible to say whether the price is in a downtrend or an uptrend and also whether it is a short or a long trend, based on some technical analysis. It's mostly bullshit if you ask me, but because many investors actually use those indicators the price behaviour often follows certain patterns.   
   
So where are we now?   
   
Let's start with the short term. This is a time frame traders may use to spot trading opportunities. Looking at a 1 hour chart on 31/01 the 100 MA crossed 200 MA and 50 MA has crossed 100 MA going down at around $11000 showing a pattern known as a death cross which indicates a downtrend. This was immediately picked up by traders and, in both cases, followed by a massive sell off. At the moment we are nearly at the opposite situation. The 50 MA has crossed 100 MA going up and 100 MA is about to cross 200 MA at around $8200. This pattern is known as a golden cross and strongly indicates and upward trend.   
   
Looking at the long term - which is what investors may use to identify a good entry or exit point. Looking at a 1 day price chart we're still clearly in an uptrend. For that to no longer be the case the price would have to go below around $6000, which is exactly where it bounced off recently. This is also indicated by the 50 MA slowly approaching 100 MA and when it crosses it may indicate a change of the long term trend. For that to be the case the price would have to stay below $11000 for a few more weeks/months.   
   
As you can see the above doesn't allow you to predict where the price is going to go from now, but may help you in better understanding its behaviour.   
   
So what to make out of all this? We appear to be on the crossroads. If the price manages to stay above around $8000 for the next few days it is very likely to indicate a short term uptrend, and it may well continue up to around $11000 in the following weeks which would mean it has officially recovered. I consider this a more likely scenario (may be wishful thinking though). An important indicator to look for is going to be crossing $9500 in the next few days. On the other hand if the price goes below $8000, or perhaps more specifically, below $7600, it is quite likely to fall to $6000 levels again, and in the longer term indicate we're in a full on bear market.

It's a great idea, just don't put a portion bigger than you're comfortable with losing. I used to do this then stopped after BTC went over $3K. Now I regret stopping. In the long term it's always a winning strategy as it makes you immune to FUD/FOMO cycles as long as you stay consistent.

@_date: 2018-02-01 11:06:54
No, this is misleading. Sure there are potentially technologically superior solutions out there, but just ask yourself this question: if you had a $100 mill or $1 bn and wanted to stash it in crypto what safe, working, proven and decentralised options out there? Pretty much none. You wouldn't risk that kind of money on something that only has a testnet or a whitepaper, or is easily controlled by a small group or organisation. Bitcoin is the only mature and secure cryptocurrency still and it's not going to change anytime soon.

No. Immutability is one of the key characteristics of distributed ledger technologies. Without it Bitcoin would lose a lot of its value. It's quite important to actually understand how unique and valuable of a feature this is. Most things in the world can be undone, reversed, forged, duplicated etc. Bitcoin's blockchain cannot.  
   
Aside from who would actually have the power to authorise such reversals it would dramatically lower the overall level of trust in the system. If you allowed to reverse a transaction in extreme circumstances (like theft) would you also allow it in case of user mistake (e.g. sending to a wrong address)? What if the user paid for something and then claimed it was a mistake and wanted the transaction reversed after receiving the goods or service? As a business accepting bitcoin payments, would you put trust in it knowing that transactions can be reversed? How about transactions worth millions? What if the government didn't like some transactions and wanted them reversed? You see where this is going?

Not quite. You generally don't make Linux forks. All Linux distributions are essentially based on the same Linux kernel, sometimes with minor patches or modifications which, if approved, often become part of the kernel itself. Now on top of the kernel distributions can do whatever they want, but then none of them make claims of being "The real Linux".   
   
The BCH situation is similar to someone actually forking the Linux kernel, having their changes disapproved by the community, and starting a campaign to call his kernel "the real Linux". Or someone making their own Linux distro and hijacking a brand of an existing Linux distribution, like Debian, and calling his distro "the real Debian". Nobody does that. Mainly because there is no financial incentive, unlike in crypto.

Well, assuming that was a real question, ICANN is a serious business and they're unlikely to look at marketing claims made by some altcoin for solutions on how to run the Internet. Besides they do have their own solutions to the problem like DNSSEC. Also updating the protocols the Internet runs on is not something that can be done overnight. DNSSEC is one example, IPv6 is another.

Isn't it a bit unusual that alts appear to be pretty much unaffected by this dip? Most of the time when there's a dip in BTC alt market goes all red, often dropping considerably more than BTC itself. Right now, if you look at coinmarketcap prices in BTC, it's mostly green.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:32:05
If you have any remaining bcash on coinbase, now may be a good time to sell it for BTC.

Well in most "literature" the golden cross and death cross refer to a 1 day chart. Most bots and traders would rely on this indicator. Choosing a 4 hour time frame seems a bit arbitrary, but I don't really know, that's why I'm asking. It's a genuine question.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:54:23
You bet!
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:00:00
Yeah, that BTC futures announcement at the beginning of December had no impact on price whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:55:24
This is so blown out of proportions though. It's simply a social campaign to highlight the risks associated with trading and investing in crypto. While I don't necessarily agree with their means of (partially) undisclosed social media campaign, it works as a healthy counter-balance to all the get-rich-quick mentality. The last thing we want is having more people putting all their savings or borrowed money into crypto without understanding the risk.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:22:57
My BTC balance is 0, but they owe me some BCH, so I don't want to burn any bridges. And yeah they already have my personal information.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:49:58
There is absolutely no way of knowing, but many technical indicators, including 300 days MA, point towards around $6000.

Dollar cost average. Buy some now and some after few days.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:26:49
Is it up to clients to implement it then? Why no one's doing it?
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:46:29
Do people really think this is an accurate analogy to current situation? Global banking industry's power rivals that of most nation states. It's valued in hundreds of trillions of dollars. Get real people. At best Bitcoin should be a tiny little guy who slips between the panels.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:30:05
Yes, that's pretty accurate. It's mostly about breaking out of 7700 - 9500 range right now.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:24:57
Some of which are exchanges and some are inaccessible. So it's more like 20% and 500. Still a lot, but not quite as bad. And really the same thing can be said about most wealth in the world. It's highly concentrated in hands of relatively few individuals/entities. Bitcoin doesn't even look bad in comparison.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:59:17
Gdax pays that for you though.

Nothing's changed really. In fact Bitcoin has never looked better. Just look at all the other threads outside of this one.

Well you didn't expand on either what you think or what I supposedly think so there's clearly a room for misunderstanding. Besides I didn't really lay out my thoughts on why I believe Bitcoin is doing great, only answered the question why one may get an impression that the community is losing hope.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:32:29
That's nonsense. Do you understand how DNS works? Or TCP/IP? Few people do, yet everyone's using it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:33:23
In USD yeah, switch to BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:45:38
Yeah sure, Bitcoin is just an example, but the best one so far. What I mean is that you cannot have blockchain without an incentive for people to run the nodes and cryptocurrency is what provides that incentive.   
There's an interesting discussion going on on that very subject right now in Davos you can watch live here: 
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:18:48
No. Not until we cross $9500 and stay there.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:50:42
And who would run the nodes and guarantee that this ledger is in fact immutable and irreversible? You can't put a few nodes together in your office and call it a distributed ledger. A blockchain run by banks would be just as good as a centralised database. Bitcoin's blockchain is *truly* immutable, which is where a lot of its value comes from. This is something many people jumping on altcoins bandwagon fail to understand.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:03:05
Yeah, they've been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like, hence the price too.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:29:28
Yeah I've got the coins without any issues and never really had any problems with Circle. In fact it was one of the best places for easily buying BTC back when they provided this service. They also owe me some BCH, which I'll be able to claim once their new crypto trading platform goes life, so I'd prefer not to close the account tbh.   
   
The best I've come up with is to just tell them it's a private address and I don't have the permission to provide personal details of the holder.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:44:12
$60K is indeed quite a lot. If I'd lost $50K I'd feel devastated.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:32:00
There's a 1000 BTC buy wall on bitfinex. Surely this cannot be easily broken.
@_date: 2018-07-28 23:12:00
Yeah, so there are two things to consider.   
   
Firstly you're going to find similar wealth distribution in most asset classes, and it is what's called Pareto distribution ( This isn't even due to the specifics of the economic system, but more of a natural law which applies to multiple phenomena and it's sometimes simplified as a 80-20 rule (which is somewhat inaccurate, as the scale is exponential but gives you the right idea). For example:   
* 80% of the company's profits are generated by 20% of its customers   
* 20% of cities contain 80% of the population   
* 20% of the words in the language account for 80% of text written in that language   
* 20% of the stars in the universe account for 80% of its entire mass...   
   
Therefore Bitcoin's wealth distribution is not anything Bitcoin specific and is characteristic for most wealth in the world ( In fact Bitcoin doesn't even look that bad in comparison to some assets, so the argument that this particular Bitcoin's characteristics makes it worse than other assets is invalid.   
   
Secondly, the manipulation of the market is greatly exaggerated. Sure, it likely does happen in an unregulated market like crypto, but in practice any attempts to manipulate the market on a large scale are going to be unprofitable, if not impossible due to the very way of how the market works. For every one whale wanting the price to do one thing, you have a hundred or a thousand that want it to do something else. So, unless you believe in some giant conspiracy between most of the market participants (which: a) would be extremely difficult to implement in practice; b) we have a competing sub which specialises in this kind of thinking), the end result is always the aggregate of all the actions of all the actors and at no point is fully known or intended by any individual one.
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:04:59
Usually just below a major resistance line or half the distance between the buy price and the target price, below the buy price. Ideally both.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:30:05
It's related to volatility. If bitcoin price changes dramatically, so do prices of all alts. As bitcoin price becomes more stable, altcoins are allowed to have more life of their own.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:40:19
I always carry around a bunch of 100 sat paper wallets for cases like this.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:31:07
I agree. This is exactly the type of post you'd mostly see in the other subreddit. And the argument is not even that good, since BCH is less than 1 year old and its community is actually relatively large for an altcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:27:30
"Decentralised", right.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:54:47
I'm not really saying that will happen. Was just trying to demonstrate that your logic works both ways. You could say the same when it was trying to break 11.7 before and we all know how this ended up.

Pay for pizza with €15 worth of BTC then buy €15 worth of BTC. You'll use your bitcoins and end up with the same amount.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:06:57
I'd wait till we test 6k again. Maybe it won't go further than that and you'd have sold near the bottom.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:56:40
I was telling a friend to buy &lt; $1000. He eventually bought at $17k.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:16:23
Don't forget that every time the price action changes direction it's always either a "bull trap" or a "bear trap". Oh and, simultaneously, when the price goes 5% in one direction it's always either a start of a bull run or the end of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:16:11
Idk about today, but it's probably gonna stay between 9K and 9.4K for a while before hopefully approaching 10K, which is going to be a real test and some heavy resistance (200 dma, major trandline, nice round number). I'm staying cautiously optimistic until 10K is broken.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:57:22
I think it is mainly its following, with their toxicity, dishonest, manipulative marketing, conspiracy theories and tribal mentality which gives it a bad rep. There's nothing inherently wrong with the coin itself. Technically it's essentially Bitcoin with no Segwit, larger blocks, less adoption, 10th of the hashpower, twice the centralisation and fraction of the value.
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:29:43
They may or may not be. The thing is that not every price swing is a "trap".
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:45:45
There's also ZenCash.
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:42:27
Well, no. A "trap" is a price action contrary to the signal preceeding it. For example if you see a bull flag followed by the price going down, that's a bull trap. The price approaching major resistance level and then going back down is not a "trap", since most traders (as opposed to gamblers) are not going to open positions before the breakout is confirmed, and therefore won't become "trapped". I keep seeing bull traps and bear traps mentioned here every day, even though there are none in the charts.

Based on what?
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:06:02
Each time it touches 9k that's another bunch of buy orders taken out of the system. Soon they'll all be gone an we'll break through on the way to 6K.
