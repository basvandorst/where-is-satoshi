Why are you so bearish? I think thats a better question.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:46:59
No that is not true. For good store of value its value just has to go up over time relative to other things.  Bitcoin will inherently have bubbles and dips until "It its value eventually plateau when its wildly held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value eventually dwindles"(quote from above).
Until it is wildly held(we are at less then 5% penetration now) its value will be volatile.  From above it clearly shows until we get to true medium of exchange its value will be volatile necessitating bubbles and dips.  In fact without the bubbles to take is up in value and get the asset spread out to enough people true medium of exchange could never happen.

Well it always has so far but go on and think this time is different even tho by most metrics I follow bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:47:46
It does go up over time. Your time frame just needs to be adjusted.  If you learned anything about bitcoin you should have read that it had made bubbles and popped those bubbles in the past no?  Or did you think it got to 19K by going up in a straight line?
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:57:02
What?  This does not pertain to me or anything I said.  From your post history I can see that you were buying bitcoin about the same time I sold some of my stash.  Got ~4500% return from when I bought in.  I know where it has gone in value I have watched this whole show before during MT gox years ago where it was MORE volatile and crashed more in % terms. 
Thats right everything you just quoted is wrong. Bitcoin is becoming LESS volatile over time if you look at the % moves(which is the only sane way to) and its value over a period of a few years has never been down.  
"with ZERO supporting argument of why it’s somehow showing long term growth and increasing value potential"
I would look at the work being done on the lightning network  showing growth and more use.  Or how localbitcoins volume(actually P2P cash) is going up over time especially in places with unstable currencies.
Keep thinking bitcoin is dead. Go ahead and sell if you want.  It might crash more I sure don't know for sure but to say you know its dead or has no use is just nearsighted and not the type of thinking that makes money in investing.
Edit: I forgot to say I've been cost averaging buying back some of the bitcoin I sold. Prices may dip further but unless a problem is uncovered in the underlying protocol bitcoin isn't going anywhere.

Bunch of new accounts used to FUD??? Who r u and what is your purpose here?!?
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:04:54
What im saying is that is a very narrow opinion and you need to open your mind.  We are very FAR from market saturation I.E. Bitcoin has SOO much room to grow and as it does it will grow in value.  
I swear people of this age think they deserve rewards immediately.  I sat thru 3 years at breakeven with my investment and I just kept learning about the technology and seeing what other projects(altcoins) are worth anything(most arn't).  Being patient has allowed me to pay off all my debt and still have a good chunk riding on bitcoin.
While I did sell some when it was obviously over hyped I am now buying now that I see the tears of the salty newbs as I know thats a good time to accumulate for the next run.
Your not the first person to think bitcoin is dead and you won't be the last but honeybadger don't care and will likely be around long after you or I.

You don't know enough about investing to understand shorting but you are going to buy a speculative digital token after its up 1000% or more in a year?  I have learned way more about bitcoin and investing(I've mined it, I've shorted it and I have never bought or read one "book" on bitcoin.  All the information you need is available for free on the internet.
Then again I didn't invest in the technology just to make money but because I learned enough about it to realize its revolutionary technology.  I started investing at 1k at the end of 2013 and had to hold(and I kept investing) all thru the Mt gox crash to under $200 bucks.  I don't know if the technology gets mainstream or not(I think it does) but this is still EARLY man.  Learn some stats on bitcoin adoption, less then 5% of the world even owns any.  If even a fraction of those people have a use for it(think Turkey's current currency problem) then its value will be many many multiples of what it is today.

This is what I do to move the bitcoin I have in tails. Personally I think this is safer then trying to upgrade electrum in tails.
If you have bitcoin in an outdated version of electrum in tails follow these steps(you don't even have to connect to the internet).
1. Load up tails and open you electrum wallet.
2.  Get your transaction ready to send (put in the address destination amount and fee amount) you may have to look at bitcoinfees.earn.com if not connected to the internet to see the proper sat/byte to use. BUT DON"T HIT SEND!
3.  Click on PREVIEW.
4.  Now you can click on SIGN which will ask for your wallet password(if your wallet is encrypted) once signed you will be able to see a transaction ID but the transaction will still not be sent.
5.  Now you could click on broadcast to try and send that transaction but if your using an outdated version of electrum then you could get a malicious server that will send you the phishing link. So what you want to do instead is click on EXPORT.
6.  Tails is very picky about where it lets you save things so I always save the transaction in the /home/amnesia/Persistent/Tor Browser/ folder as it seems to let any program save there.
7.  Now what I do here to get the saved transaction file to windows is just copy the file from the folder I saved it to a NTFS formatted USB drive(NTFS so both tails and windows can see it).
8.  In windows you can make sure you have the latest version of electrum from electrum.org
9.  When you have the latest version run it(it will make you create a wallet to get into the program you don't have to use this wallet or its seed if you don't want to), once inside the program go to TOOLS-&gt;Load transaction-&gt;From file.
10.  Navigate to your USB drive with the wallet file on it and open it. You should see your transaction there ready to hit "Broadcast" as you already signed it in a previous step.
This is personally what I do to have a cold wallet setup and never expose my seed to an operating system like windows. You can also set up a "Watch Only" wallet in windows by going to WALLET-&gt;Information(on your tails electrum) and importing that Master Public Key into your windows electrum. If you do this properly your bitcoin never really needs access to the internet making it pretty hard to steal.
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:17:19
Or you can export transactions and use a watch only wallet in windows until they get electrum upgraded in tails.

The chain with the most PoW will be bitcoin.  Right now 92% of miners are signaling 2x support.  I really don't care which side wins tho I think 2x is a good compromise.  
Why does core think it has economic majority? There is going to be MASS confusion and problems if we get a unclear fork like this.

@_date: 2017-08-24 23:39:36
It also has 4x faster block times so by design has 4x the bandwith/time for transactions.  Also Charlie LTC's developer has a deal with miners to up the blocksize when needed.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:30:31
I've already done that. Well not full but 80% or so.  LTC got segwit activated without splitting in 3.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:40:51
Not correct. All a node does is relay transactions and blocks.  Without miners you won't get blocks to relay and transactions will be even harder to confirm.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:47:12
You can try  and get your transaction "accelerated".  You have to try at the right time tho as there are lots of people trying to do the same thing.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:28:53
I understand why you would be scared with the precedent of going along with the fork that a "few people at dinner" decided.  I agree it sets a risky precedent that could try and be exploited in the future. 
The thing is tho the current fork they are proposing isn't really that controversial in substance(doubling the blocksize) and is even wanted by some in the community.  If someone wanted to change the mining rewards or something that changes the value proposition of bitcoin then no one would ever go with that fork.
In sum I still think allowing this chaos to take place is a much worse choice than the danger of setting a questionable precedent. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:00:32
That is all well and good from a philosophical stance, and I do agree on most your points however I choose to live in the real world.  The real world where bitpay and many other major companies may not follow the core chain.  The real world where if 90% of miners do what they say they will the core fork will so many fewer blocks found that the network will seize up and require a POW change.  
This could at least cause massive chaos and I don't think people are taking the risk this poses as a real threat.  I personally am of the viewpoint if core would just endorse 2x then we would have overwhelming support and they could make sure the coding is up to par.  
I am just of the mindset that a real contentions fork with no clear winner is worse then going along with an upgrade.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:33:42
Core could totally end up as the alt coin.  Is it over 50% chance? I don't have a clue but I think it very well could be and its crazy more people aren't worried about this.

The idea for this hardfork was put out in May of this year.  
How do you define almost all the miners alot of economic nodes and what I can see is at least a decent number of users as a "small minority"???

Gemini is required to follow the fork with the most PoW?
Wouldn't you guess that is the chain that has 92% of miners signaling for it already? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:05:06
It says token holders get 18% of revenue from mining operations! This could be huge a proper dividend on a token.  Quick someone who speaks Russian figure out when they are doing the ICO.

How about it would never happen under normal circumstances.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:13:05
What I seriously want to know is why are we all so worried about doubling the size of the chain? 
8 mb blocks I could see as to much but even with segwit enabled the blocksize will not increase that much unless all the data is witness data.  Why is it so dangerous to double the on chain space right now?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:30:05
I think you don't understand that the fork that gets the most mining power and exchange support will be "bitcoin".  You might very well end up with BCORE coin or something.  
Note: I don't want this to happen I am just trying to look at this with an open mind and there is no guarantee that core will be "bitcoin" when you go to a bitcoin exchange and buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:10:48
If the blockchain is so full with these spam transactions then show me ONE.  I myself look at random bitcoin transactions and how long they take to confirm as a measure of the health of the network all the time.  I don't see any spam and its never been worse IMO.

I think core not supporting S2X when over 90% of hashrate is signaling for it is absolute madness...
Also companies like bitpay supporting it.  I'm sure I will get downvotes but all the core "believers" may end up with an altcoin.  It could happen.

92% of mining is signaling for 2x.  Think what you want but without hashing power core WILL fail and not be as secure.  I don't understand why we can't just all agree to go with 2x and not make a THIRD "bitcoin".
There must be soooo many newbs buying right now cuz it seems the market does not care that a very controversial split could be coming.

This is the original post that I still see when logged in. [Original](
My reply got to the top of the thread and was then removed because it doesn't fit the narrative being promoted here.  We will never know what the "community" thinks about subjects if we cannot even discuss them.
For everyone that says "oh just redditor for 3 months" I have a Sr. Member account at bitcointalk that I've been using since 2013. I just never cared enough about the "politics" and moon memes discussed here to make a reddit account until recently.  I have been a part of the bitcoin community for years and would like to be able to discuss what I think could be a major issue for bitcoin's future.

From how I understand it "atomic swaps" means you will be able to exchange LTC/BTC over the blockchain without the need for a centralized exchange.

When you go to use an exchange there is no guarantee that bitcoin core chain will be called bitcoin if 2x ends up with majority hashrate(which seems likely).
You can call it an altcoin but everyone else might not.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:40:42
Am I right to think with segwit enabled on both BTC and LTC you can do atomic swaps and pretty much send bitcoin over the litecoin network?
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:03:59
If 2x doesn't get adopted by core and I doubt it will I see massive chaos coming up.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:37:30
They might be a small minority but they are the ones that invested heavily to mine on the network and therefore control block generation.  Also over 90% are STILL signaling for the fork.  I really don't know what side is on the "right" but I do know if the miners want to change bitcoin they have way more influence then the average user.
You do know exchanges like Gemini are contractually obligated to follow the chain with most hashpower?  The miners decide more then you and alot of people here are admitting. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:20:47
How is any price of any commodity or currency or stock or house or ANYTHING assigned a value?
The answer is two humans decide on a price of apples to oranges(or USD/BTC) and make a trade. You get alot of people doing this you get a market.  Bitcoins markets encompass all the exchanges in all the countries that trade it.

@_date: 2018-07-05 16:21:17
"should be furious that it's not stable and be seeking out the reasons why"
Its very simple.  Bitcoin can not be stable as long as it is in the process of being adopted.  Once bitcoin reaches market saturation whether that be 5% of the world or 100% that is when its price "should" stabilize some.
The reason the fiat you talk about is relatively stable is due to millions of people transacting in it and trading their labor for it.  Without a mass amount of people using a currency its value would be volatile.  
Bitcoin just hasn't reached a very large saturation point yet.  Its still mostly just a niche market for risk takers and while I think the technology is amazing and have used bitcoin to buy things I also realize its not ready for my mom to use it.  
All this is the actual reason I think bitcoin is a good buy at almost any price before widespread adoption as its value should be many multiples of its current price if it ever does achieve a high level of adoption.  I personally just look at bitcoin's price as an indicator of peoples future expectations of its rate of adoption, as markets always care more about the future than the present.

I think you are correct in you reasoning and I am sorry for your loss.  I personally have some ltc stuck in bitvc and I expect I will never be able to withdraw it.  It sucks to just give up hope in these situations but it helps you to move on and stay focused on what matters.
