Chip-Chap's service is great! It's currently only available in a few countries but the fact of the matter is.... You ONLY need your phone number to use this Bitcoin company.

Josh vs. Josh
**With that in mind how do you feel about somebody like Josh of Butterfly Labs that antagonizes and harasses their customer base? It leaves a bad taste in people mouths inside and outside the industry when people like Josh from BFL are literally trolling and antagonizing the community and people who buy his miners.+**
It is obviously not good. I think that action has to take place to fix it. I think with companies like ours getting bigger in scale, we can do things like that. Let me give you an example.+
For example, a company I spoke to a few days ago is an ASIC company that makes a new Scrypt product yet to be released in Q3 to Q4. Great company, great product, great group of guys, very innovative but in no hurry. They have x amount of $ in seed money, and no one knows their product and brand. I approached them and said what if I could raise a million dollars in pre-orders for your product how would that move up your timetable? The guy was like “I can move my time table up two months.”+
My goal is I want to help smaller companies who have great ideas and concepts get bigger faster. At the end of the day none of those guys (BFL) would be able to behave that way if they were competed against properly. It is one of the greatest things about the US is companies if they do not perform you can out compete them. My goal is to foster more competition by helping some of these smaller companies come to market by leveraging our scale and brand so they can properly compete with some of these other companies that have gotten so big without competition that they just don’t care anymore. If you cannot get a guy to change the best thing to do is to compete with them.

That's awesome that you paid your tuition with the fiat earned on your wise decision to hold Bitcoin with us.

I for one, am happy that Bitcoin disciples across the Sud of America are banding together to fight financial corruption at its source!

En serio?
The fact of the matter is this: If they find a way to ban it, Bitcoin will fork to forbid that currently technologically unfeasible ban or some other altcoin will. Open source is the way. Come my disciples.

George Selgin is an evolved Austrian.  He's the one who is pioneering the development of monetary theory to include "synthetic" or "quasi" commodity monies, which is what Bitcoin is.

Eventually migrant/immigrant workers will be asking to be paid in Bitcoin as it will save them fees since they will be using Bitcoins for remittances anyways.
Welcome to the future.
