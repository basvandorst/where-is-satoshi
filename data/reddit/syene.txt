They missed my brother's first build by about two weeks; went with TigerDirect.

How about Catoshis?

For me, everything past the third page is just blank :-/

Any sites that sell physical books? The only one I've found (bitcoinin) has a rather pitiful collection.

I'm in a similar boat;  a simple prepaid phone that costs me less than $200 a year. The one and only downside is that the provider doesn't have any android phones.

I don't know it. Link?

1. To support the Bitcoin economy by buying stuff with Bitcoin. Very difficult to accomplish without them.
2. For the near future, whatever analogues of Amazon, Newegg, and Steam I can find. Long-term, anywhere and everywhere.
3. Yes. For however much Bitcoin I managed to spend in place of USD last week, for as long as my employer keeps paying in USD.

My roommate loves hot foods. Maybe I'll get him some for Christmas. What's the shelf life for these?

The search function for coingig is... lacking.
Couldn't get any search results looking for what I want, so I tried searching for items that were already on the front page ("transformers", "chair", "sunglasses", etc). The only word to return any results was "sticker".

Any suggestions?

If you cash out for the amount of your initial investment, you won't need to fear for the rest of it.

Awesome, thanks. I'll keep an eye out.

Do we dumbphone owners have any practical way to use this?

It's the only search result when looking for Magic: The Gathering. Oh well, at least that's less wrong than Bitcoinin's [only result] ( Neither site has trading card sleeves, Dresden Files, RIFTS RPG books, etc.
Bitcoinin *does* have Wheel of Time and The Emperor's Soul, so things are slightly in their favor so far.

I was sad because I had just purchased the bundle yesterday using the boring way; but turns out you can 'up' your purchase using BTC (well, you can up it any other way too, but mixed payment support is nice). Which is awesome 'cause I hadn't noticed the $35 bonus game until after my purchase. Upped it by .08865 BTC ($10).

So he'd basically get a PDA. I tried carrying one around years ago (back before smartphones were a thing), and I found that the bulk of *another* thing to carry around in my pockets just wasn't worthwhile.
