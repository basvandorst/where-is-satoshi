Belief without any kind of supporting evidence is generally a bad basis for any kind of investment. Everyone who has been a successful investor over the long run understands that some investments simply do not work out. When that happens, they take their losses and run. Those who do not do that, will eventually make the one mistake that eliminates them.
What you are essentially trying to do is relying on mean reversion. Mean reversion is a nice principle that works maybe 9 out of 10 times. But the one time it does not work, you get killed if you are not very careful. This is especially true if you don't know where the fair value or a hard floor (e.g. liquidation value of a company) is. You can probably do this very well in something like the GE stock because that company is well understood and unlikely to do anything crazy. But had you tried the same thing in stocks like Nortel, Enron or Lehman, you would have been annihilated. BTC is extremely volatile and poorly understood. I don't think there is anyone who knows the fair value of this and the intrinsic value of a Bitcoin is zero.

You can make a bad investment and make money and you can make a good investment and lose money. That's the thing that most people don't understand about investing. You cannot control individual outcomes of investments, you can only control your process for making investment decisions. If you build a portfolio of n good investments, then some will be winners and some will be losers, but your bottom line will be positive if your decision making process makes sense.

You can do all the homework you want, but you can never control the outcome of any investment. Adding to a losing position does not work out. It is something that amateurs do who think that they are clever, but who will inevitably get burned at some point.

That only makes sense in an asset that is currently in an uptrend. Averaging into something that is in a long-term downtrend and gives you no indication that it is going to turn around in the foreseeable future is the best way to burn lots of capital or at least tie it up for along time if you get lucky. Even in the latter case your investment would probably underperform other asset classes and thereby incur significant opportunity costs.

Technical analysis is based on demand and supply and underlying market psychology. It's not restricted to stocks but can be applied to currencies, commodities and basically any other financial instrument that is traded.
The problem is that lots of people are misusing it. Patterns are never a 100%, they are 60 or maybe 70% which means that at times they fail. Professional traders know and understand the implications of that. Nobody has a crystal ball and nothing is ever certain when dealing with financial markets.

That's not despair. Despair is reached when is full of people declaring BTC dead, selling their holdings and announcing their imminent suicide after losing everything.
I'd say right now we're in *Bull trap* territory where people think that it's a great buying opportunity because it **obviously** cannot go down much more after falling from 1200 to 440.

Good advice, except for the part where he went broke three times because he was on the wrong side of the trade and killed himself in the end.
