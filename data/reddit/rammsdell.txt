It's really flakey at the moment.

If he did scam you, at least you can easily find out who he is since he didn't register [his domain name privately](

The perks don't make sense.  Why would anyone want to spend $1000 for 10 identical cards with their name on them.
All sorts of weird shit all over.  It's a scam.

I ordered in early march,  I had to send 3 emails but I eventually got a response and they refunded my ordered.  If they hadn't, since I payed through paypal I could have gone further to get my money back.  They don't want to give refunds, but that doesn't mean you can't get credit card companies or paypal involved to help sort the issue out.

Looks like campbx is down too.  Possibly from people scrambling to switch trading platforms or from a denial of service.

I've purchased a few things with bitcoins.  I was able to purchase e-cig mods and parts from ecig vendors who accept bitcoins using the bitpay service.  I was pretty stoked that I took money earned from mining and spent it on a physical object.

campbx now has direct deposit that can dump the funds into your bank account using the routing number and account number and claims to only take 2-3 days to withdraw funds.  They used to use dwolla but that took a lot of pre-setup to get verified and a bank account linked. to them, it used to take 3 days to get the funds to dwolla then another 5 days to get the funds from dwolla into the bank account.

That's pretty close to 5 Million dollars at the time of the trade.
