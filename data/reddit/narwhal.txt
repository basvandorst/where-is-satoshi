To open a channel you both put a hold on some funds while transacting back and forth. Either party can close the channel at any time. If anyone tries to screw someone, you just broadcast proof to the network and all the coins on hold are awarded to the cheated party.

Most forks don’t have buyers, so they disappear immediately. The ones that survive usually fall to zero eventually.

Decentralization only matters when trust is involved. Lightning transactions are trustless. Even if a single lightning node processed 90% of transactions it wouldn’t matter because every lightning transaction is done inside a smart contract enforced by miners.
Also, you don’t need to open a channel every time you want to send bitcoin to someone. Just connect your lightning wallet to a hub and the network will automatically route your transaction through multiple channels as needed to your destination.

Bitcoin itself is still decentralized, as is *enforcement of all lightning transactions*. Lightning hubs must follow consensus rules or they lose their money.
Centralization only matters when trust is involved. Lightning transactions are trustless. It doesn’t matter who is processing them. Instant free transactions without requiring trust is an absolute breakthrough.

Lightning nodes are *trustless*. That’s the breakthrough. Even if one lightning node had 90% market share, it wouldn’t matter. They wouldn’t be able to do anything with your coins, because everything they do is inside a standardized smart contract enforced by the decentralized bitcoin network. Lightning defines the consensus rules for those smart contracts.

Which wouldn’t affect you because lightning is trustless. Just connect to a different node.

The whole point of bitcoin is that it’s decentralized. That’s what gives it value. Transaction fees are required to incentivize enough miners to participate and verify transactions independently, making it harder for 51% to collude.
Even if transactions were free it would still be way too slow to be practical for micro transactions. However! Lightning network is on the development roadmap for bitcoin which will enable instant, free transactions in a decentralized sublayer.

Transactions are confirmed instantly even if they happen offchain because miners handle disputes. Lightning defines the consensus rules and if anyone tries to cheat, just publish proof and all the coins in the channel get awarded to the cheated party.

No. Lightning transactions are instant for both parties. The final balance gets added to the blockchain when the payment channel is closed, which either one or both of you can do at any time. Or just leave it open indefinitely. If someone tries to cheat, they'll lose the coins they put in escrow when they opened the payment channel. Lightning transactions happen inside trustless, smart contracts that are enforced by the bitcoin network.
The tradeoff is that some coins are locked while the payment channel is open. However, you don't need a payment channel directly with Starbucks. You can have a payment channel open with Bob who has one with Carol who has one with Google who has one with Starbucks, and the network will find the shortest path. From the end user's perspective, all you'll need is a lightning wallet and all the transactions from there happen instantly.
