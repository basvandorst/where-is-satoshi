Ah but see they are going to enable withdrawals/deposits and possibly even trading well before any real authorities have been able to step in.
That's the criminal part.
They should not be left in charge of their remaining funds until all due process has been carried out by independent parties. 
They claim to not be responsible for users' funds but at the same time allowed to dictate how they are handled int his situation. Ridiculous.

Who would have such administrator access? Occam's razor.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:41:54
They are proposing acting as judicial oversight of users' funds in the aftermath of losing $60 million of users' funds. They are holding other people's money hostage and plan to force some of them to pay for losses. They are proposing giving money out to some and taking money away from others with no legal oversight. All with no proof they didn't steal the funds themselves, or even a more plausible story.
That's as concisely as I can put it.
Now they have revealed that user data may have also been compromised.
He isn't a criminal yet, but when the site goes back online to either enable withdrawals or trading, and he continues to stand behind it with the title of Director, he will go to jail with the rest of them.

That would be more work, more money, and less effective than what I'm currently doing, I am certain. Again, the amount I stand to recover is also mot worth that. I simply want bitfinex to be held accountable and investigated. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:26:09
That's why I said proposed. "Leaning towards" by zane's words
They've indicated not the slightest intentions of making users whole again or of shutting down operations. Those are the two important things and they don't even care.
The actions of another don't make someone guilty until that other person acts as an accomplice, which he is doing now. Who knows what Zane knows? You see the shorting on the exchange he used to work at right before the hack? Pure speculation, but we have absolutely no clue he isn't the most liable party in all of this. They've released no details at all to indicate anything more likely than an inside job.
How do you explain bypassing multisig, bitgo's security, and bitgo's limits? I say the most plausible explanation is inside job. Explains it in a heartbeat. Now you give me a more plausible explanation?
Zane said many times they have no reason to think user's info was compromised. Now he is releasing that it was. Oh my god stop treating these guys like victims. The situation is blatant crime, whether by hacker or them, and they are acting as both the victim and the law in it. Absurd.
I don't think he calls any shots. I think he is a fall guy who is buying them valuable time.

Forget his age, let's focus on what's important:

I agree 100% and I expect no money back anytime soon.
Much more concerned with seeing these guys held accountable and heavily inspected/audited than I am with getting up to 30% of my money back. 
These are a few guys sitting in a room pretending they get to decide how to make right a $60million theft due to their incompetence. That is for the courts and not them. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:06:50
You've communicated nothing. The amount of coins stolen was figured out by someone else. You haven't communicated any details of how you will make this right with the community or that you have any intentions to do so. You haven't communicated how this will affect your business going forward.
Seriously, what have you communicated other than "we will communicate more in the future guys." Typing boilerplate responses on reddit isn't communicating. You have to actually say things that mean something.
All that you have communicated is that your guys' stance is definitely going to be "Our users got their coins stolen. We never even had any bitcoins to be stolen! We didn't even really get hacked! It was the user's wallets! Tralalala let's reopen the exchange and cash in on more ETC volatility!"
Absolute joke. Having a 23 year old be your PR rep, with reddit as the medium, pretty much sums up Bitfinex and their level of professionalism. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:13:22
I am currently performing the most effort I am willing to perform due to what I stand to gain from it. 
There are people who lost thousands of bitcoins to this. I have no doubt they are taking further action.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:50:08
I've yet to see a single bit of evidence Bitfinex did not perform the "hack." Just sayin.
My favorite part though, assuming they were hacked, is the logic Zane has been proposing: 
So he said that while they control the keys, due to each user being able to trace funds to the blockchain, they are still the user's coins. This logic would apply well for the case in which they stick the user's who's actual bitcoins were stolen with the losses.
Instead, they are basically going to act as some sort of middleman, making other non affected bitcoiners chip in on the losses. So they are taking other people's bitcoin, by their definition, and using it to partially make up for bitcoin losses that they allowed to happen to other users.
As if that wasn't enough, they are going to attempt to determine what defines a "bitcoin user" on their site subjectively. Had btc on their? You are a btc user. Well maybe not if you deposited near enough or right after the hack.... Loaned usd out used to buy bitcoins? You are somehow a btc user, for loaning usd out. Those loaners had zero choice if their usd was used for btc or eth or wtvr. 
Eth/etc traders of course, even if they were trading or lending on etc/btc or eth/btc pairs, are somehow not btc users and will not be affected.
It's all such bullshit subjective cherry picking and there is a reason these matters are generally left to the courts during a bankruptcy claim. 
I am personally hoping that the losses are spread among every user who had any funds on there. Not because I want to see everyone affected or hate Eth users or anything. Purely because the more people they hurt, the more likely we are to see these guys end up behind bars. As soon as they enable trading while people are rightfully suing for money bitfinex lost for them, with absolutely no proof that bitfinex didn't do it themselves, or even a more plausible story of how it happened than an inside job, these guys will be ordered to shut down and taken to court. Zane too. Kid is more than aware of what is going on and is taking part willingly.

Ok. Just was wondering if there was a good argument for why an input wouldn't be considered a transaction. I'm sure that websites and the community will shift towards counting inputs as transactions overtime, and I'm sure the Bcash shills will spread misleading information in that regard up until then and long after.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:23:23

The percentage of people that own bitcoin who are aware of the halving might have increased since 2016.
The percentage of Bitcoins that are owned by people who know about the halvings grows every year IMO.
I'd wager that 99% of bitcoins that are owned today are owned by people aware of the halving schedule. I'd say that makes the market very aware of it.

I’ll trust your math, but that’s still assuming we can’t fit more on chain transactions per block by then or increase blocksize. But yeah I think on chain transactions will ultimately only make sense for a limited subset of use cases. Retail can be done 100% off chain for example.

@_date: 2019-03-20 16:01:42


Bitcoin is grandma friendly?!


I think large transactions will still be better suited for on-chain, where the fee paid to have high priority will be negligible. 
This is the beauty of a second layer that will primarily suit small transactions: more space will be freed up on chain for the large transactions.
And finally, like others are saying, it's completely optional to use. If it falls flat on it's face and is a failure, the blocksize would likely be increased.
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:49:34
The miners and nodes make up the middlemen, it’s just decentralized. That’s why you pay the fee. Calling it a mining fee doesn’t it make it not a transaction fee.

Meh. Nodes have the “power” of diverting from the main chain. Aka no power.
It’s proof of work, not proof of node validation. All the work is done by miners.
Or maybe being able to say “Ha! My node said your hardfork is invalid!” means something to you.... to each their own.
EDIT: 
His whole entire article is so damn silly. Look at this ball of fully validating nodes! They won't validate invalid blocks just because a miner mines them! The whole point he is missing is that in the event of a hardfork where the majority of hashrate agrees to make a change that would cause those nodes to mark blocks invalid and hence not relay them further is that those miners could give two shits if those nodes marked them invalid or didn't relay them. 
Even if the nodes are coinbase, gemini, bitmex, satoshi himself, and 99% of bitcoin nodes around the world, they don't give a shit. Reject all you want. All of those nodes combine for zero hashrate and wouldn't be able to mine one block in a million years. Guess what not mining a block means?!?! No transactions! So now they get to sit there and pay each other on the back for basically saying "your blocks are invalid in our literally dead blockchain where there will never be a transaction again." 
In the event of a hardfork where 75% of the hashrate created invalid blocks, you'd still have 25% of the hashrate and you'd get blocks every 40 minutes or so until the next difficulty adjustment. In this contentious hardfork scenario, the non mining nodes sort of kind of matter. They relay valid blocks from that 25% of hashrate. 
UASF didn't do a damn thing IMO. What prevented the contentious hardfork was the bull market and the future pricing of Bitcoin unlimited and bitcoin segwit 2x. Non mining nodes are essential to literally nothing.

They are separate entities. The Federal reserve is a private entity with 5 of 9 board members being privately appointed.

The reason they are in China is simply because electricity is cheaper there. China happily generates dirty coal energy at cheaper prices than the rest of the world. 
PoW leads to ASICS. If the PoW algorithm changed occasionally to avoid ASICS taking over, then that would just make the hashrate very volatile and jeopardize bitcoins security far more than geographical centralization of mining does.

When the government asks the federal reserve for thorough audit results, the federal reserve says "fuck you." That should clarify the relationship.
You seem to be under the impression the government can boss the federal reserve around, but it's the exact opposite. I think that makes you an optimist!
When the biggest banks in the united states needed to be bailed out the us government said "how high?"
Like I said, the federal reserve doesn't need to demand repayment. They profit either way. They hedge by betting that the government does not pay it back.

Saying Liquid makes Bitcoin Centralized is like saying CryptoKitties makes Ethereum all about cats.

No it's not. Right now that is just a really expensive and stupid way to spend fiat. You aren't spending Bitcoin when you do this. The merchant you are paying likely never receives any bitcoin and the merchant or you will be charged by the payment provider for turing your btc into fiat. 
There is a huge difference between actually spending bitcoin (buying a car from a dude by sending BTC to his wallet) and using bitcoin to spend fiat (buying a video game on steam with the bitcoin payment option). The latter is a really dumb version of paypal.

This is the amazing part of LN to me. The cost of transactions will now more directly correlate with the cost of running a node. If node's were expensive to operate, people would have to charge higher fees. If they are cheap to operate, they might charge no fees. So maybe core/blockstream were on to something with keeping the cost of running nodes low....Go figure.

You know, with lightning network, the "run your own node" and "it should be as cheap as possible to run a node" things make sense very easily: Nodes will choose what fee they charge, if you want zero fees or low fees, make nodes cheap to run and provide a ton of paths in the network to boost competition.
I must admit though, I still struggle with those two quoted arguments without the existence of LN.

@_date: 2019-12-03 18:47:26
I didn’t say it was bad. There will be some use cases in the future for which it makes a lot of sense, and this development will help it get there. This application itself won’t really make lightning super useful though IMO.
But maybe I’m wrong. Maybe if blocks get full and fees get high again, this will be how you want to withdraw/deposit your BTC from them
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:36:27
This is a cool development but the "catch" is that lightning is still probably a very pain in the ass way to deposit/withdraw compared to the alternatives.

Well there hasn't been a real bubble since the market had sufficient shorting available. 
Basically it effectively increases liquidity and supply. Without shorting, the only selling can be from people who own bitcoins. With shorting, and whale with tons of fiat can drive the price down without ever owning bitcoins. 
Yes, they can lose and become rocket fuel, but they still allow the market to keep itself in check better most of the time.

Primary difference being that all exchanges were openly agreed to treating the fork version of ethereum as ethereum. In Bitcoin's case, they've pretty much all explicitly stated they will treat a BU coin as an alt.
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:23:33

My TL;DR;
Jiang and Jihan saw that SegWit was going to be activated on litecoin, whether they liked it or not. They upped their hashrate dramatically to try to block it and force this "compromise" in order to save some face and make it look like they still had control over this issue. Charlie and the others who met with Jihan and Jiang decided they could save J and J some dignity by agreeing to a block size increase when blocks are over 50% full, which will never happen now that they have SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:23:35
I would find it more likely that Ver is behind the litecoin pump than that he will ever concede defeat.
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:33:18
"Works alright for some applications" should not be the basis for solving scalability.

I would be surprised if you weren't. That's my whole point. It's a novelty exercise for bitcoiners with not real benefit to anyone else. 


Yeah... if you are already a bitcoiner.
Listen, I'm glad for the recognition and legitimacy this brings to bitcoin. Even having a little sign like that in lots of stores is huge. At the same time, I really just don't believe there is any practicality in using bitcoin for these applications yet though. If this merchant was able to offer a bitcoin only discount, well that would be another story.
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:25:14
I'll believe it when I see it
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:51:47
Look at how Litecoin signalling progressed. It's not linear. Once a trend developers, others come on board for the sake of progress. If Jihan and Ver's pools signaled for segwit, we would already be at 60%+ and then the rest would start hopping on as it would look like  path to consensus.
Currently, with 30% for BU and 30% for segwit, the miners who are neutral between the two don't want to pick a side because both seem contentious.

As of a few months ago, yes, naked shorting was removed from chinese exchanges.
Still, if a hodler is able to loan out his supply of bitcoins so people can short with them, that is still more effective liquidity and supply. The alternative would be that those coins stay in cold storage and are effectively removed form the supply.

Everyone not closely tied to this fiasco will want to sell it as a highly positive outcome for the good of bitcoin's reputation, but the reality is very different. 
Just wait until the "hacker" returns the bitcoins to bitfinex and suddenly they have 119k bitcoins and only paid out $70mil or so in bfx redemptions while they held more bfx tokens than anyone else.

Gavin had the visit with the CIA... but... iono doesn't seem like much.
Lastly, I would say that if the chinese government or any other government wanted to really take down bitcoin, they would be much more successful IMO.
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:32:51
I don't know how any of this works. Suddenly Bitflyer has talked tons of merchants into accepting bitcoin. Bitflyer stands to make money whenever anyone buys bitcoins through them.
Yes they would process bitcoin transactions much like a bank processes fiat transactions. When I use a credit card to buy something, I'm still "using" fiat. 
If Bitflyer is converting the merchant's incoming bitcoins to fiat, then it makes no sense for someone to buy bitcoins on Bitflyer, make an off-chain payment, and pay a fee and wait for confirmation, just to have the bitcoin end up back with Bitflyer.
It just makes sense. The whole "off-chain payments aren't using bitcoin!" stance is bullshit. There will always be instances when on chain transactions don't make sense. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:28:28

No it's not. It's time to step away from social media and remember that:

That right there is the completely unsubstantiated claim that got us here in the first place. BU was a reaction to that FUD. UASF is a reaction to that FUD.

If he takes his time and sells it all through localbitcoins slowly, he can sell it anonymously and for a premium. No tax and probably end up with like $425k.
Or if he just wants to lock in the value of it all in fiat without selling, he could open a short on bitcoin for $400,000. This would essentially lock him in at $400,000 of bitcoin no matter where the price goes.

Yeah except there are no bitcoin payment processors that save merchants money. Just as expensive currently. 
Even if it did save merchants money, they’d then need to pass serious savings on to the customers before it’d make any sense to buy bitcoin for the sake of spending it. And if you just spend what you have and don’t replenish, you are spending your favorite store of value, which makes no sense either.
The killer use case is cash though! Cash’s killer app isn’t competing with visa. Cash is the slower to transact, anonymous, permission-less, decentralized settlement layer. 
Cash has a ton of great advantages, but I don’t know why people are claiming speed and ease of transaction is one of them. I don’t know how people make the leap from “Bitcoin is peer-to-peer digital cash” to “Bitcoin has to be fast and cheap cause it’s cash’

It is very heavily utilized for actual transactions. There is no requirement that those transactions have to be for things that you could use a credit card for.

Assuming LN worked perfectly, Assuming everyone had a great LN mobile wallet on their phone, assuming 250k merchants had it as a payment option, why the hell would I wanna spend my bitcoin, which are not cheap or easy to acquire, over my fiat?
Consumer to merchant transactions are not the killer app of bitcoin, at least I hope not, because that application is covered. No one in the first world has any problem paying for their coffee.

You seem to not understand how BTC settled contracts work. Bitmex doesn’t have to buy any BTC to settle the contracts.

Been in bitcoin 6 years, never heard that before. But okie dokie.


It can cause the effects of inflation. It doesn't cause actual inflation. Bitcoin supply cap wouldn't change.


No. See that's the big difference. There is no bitcoin government to bail out a bitcoin bank who gets stiffed on a bunch of loans and/or operates on a fractional reserve by printing out more bitcoin.
I hope now you see the real reason bitcoin is sound money.

@_date: 2018-12-12 18:33:58


The volume on these exchanges is negligible.


I'm sure it is. IT has been before, and it probably always will be. The best proven case of it happening was MtGox of course. When it imploded (as they will generally do), no bank came to bail them out. Customers got hurt and it hurt the Bitcoin market in the short term. However, they didn't get bailed out, and that's what matters.


Well if the price of BTC goes down, it should be easier to pay them back! (Mostly just joking here)
I mean these things are inevitable. You can't modify the bitcoin protocol to not allow these things. The protocol guarantees a capped supply, and that's all we can really do. 
Ideally, people start to value holding their own keys and not using banking services at all, thus limiting the inflationary effects of credit, cash settled futures, and fractional reserve banking. I think this will happen, but it will take time.
Still, bitcoin credit cards will surely happen. Bitcoin cash settled futures have already happened and will continue to exist. Fractional reserve banking practices with Bitcoin has happened and will continue to happen. None of this has a direct impact on the bitcoin protocol or the actual supply, and that's why I personally value bitcoin, despite those things existing. Fiat, on the other hand, literally increases the supply of USD in order to keep those inflationary practices happening. 
The banks lending bitcoin credit are playing on an even playing field due to not being able to count on being bailed out by the government. They are not "too big to fail". So they can choose how they operate their business, who they loan btc to, and if they operate on a fractional reserve. Ultimately, if they get fucked by people defaulting on loans, then their business goes under.

@_date: 2018-12-12 20:19:05
Price is low relative to?! Meaning adoption is low relative to?! 
Your argument can only say adoption is trending down from any point where the price was greater than the current price, which is less than 1/9th of BTC’s history. 
Furthermore, you are assuming market price discovery is perfect and doesn’t overshoot or undershoot the ideal price that results purely from supply and demand.

@_date: 2018-12-12 20:28:30
Relative to? You keep using terms like high, higher, low, lower, which are relative terms. 
If the price keeps dropping from here, it would seem supply still is greater than demand currently, which would still imply adoption is going down currently.
My entire point is you are completely ignoring the nearly 10 years before the price ever even got to $3k. On any timescale longer than 1.5years, price has risen which applies adoption has risen, relative to when the price was less than it currently is.
If you wanna just add a caveat that adoption is shrinking ever since late 2017 based on the price’s relationship to supply and demand, that’s fine with me.
