She's 19.  She was here in Florida visiting me last week for 4 days. She saw my little mining rig (2 Cubes and 7 Antminer U1s), and I told her all about it. 
I was actually surprised at how interested she was.  Her eyes didn't even glaze over at all as I was telling her how cool bitcoin was, and why.  Until her visit she had never heard of bitcoin, and now she tells me she has mentioned it to quite a few of her friends.  She's told them about how her dad is making his own money. lol

It is clear that you have not read the story V1 in my first link, nor Judd Bagley's site which both contain references, proof, and credible details.  You just want to sling accusations with no substance.
You also don't seem to understand the use of a tracking bug/pixel.  Unique invisible pixels do not have the ability to set a "tracking cookie", as one of your accusations suggests. 
Suggesting the setting of a "tracking cookie" is blatantly false, and an exaggeration created to make the action of Bagley sound a lot worse than it was.  This is actually a standard misinformation ploy which has been used against Byrne and his supporters repeatedly. 
To anyone who has taken the time to actually read the credible story at the link above must surely be snickering when they read your comments.  Your comments, and actions actually mirror the behavior and actions of the anti-Byrne people starting back around 2005. Time for a new act, don't you think?

"Provably fair" is a bullshit misleading term used to lure in the uneducated, making them think the odds of a particular game are fair.  The odds are not "fair".  They favor the house.
And no matter what your counter argument is to this, there is not a single casino on this planet that will claim any of their games are "fair".  If they could get away with it they certainly would.
What is meant by "provably fair" is that the game is "provably honest", but those who run such games would rather use the word "fair" to mislead people interested in playing their games, and getting them to think that they have a "fair" chance of winning, which they do not have.

There are two sides to every story. For those who are truly interested here is a very long and detailed report on how short sellers tried to destroy overstock.com.  It is a fascinating read. 
 Much of what short sellers and their media cronies do is spread negative info about their target companies to cause their stock price to drop.  There were MANY lies spread about Byrne, and overstock.com, and a lot of the negative comments I see posted here actually sound like repeats of what has already been proven false.
Did you know that the marketing director of Overstock.com is "A nudie bar dancer running the place"? And, did you know Byrne "is running a criminal enterprise out of a gay bathhouse"?  Or, how about the one that said Byrne was involved in "some kind of offshore synthetic instrument to sell his stock while hiding this from the public"?  All lies intentionally spread to harm Overstock.com, and Byrne.
  It seems like Byrne has worked very hard to uncover the illegal activities of what are called "naked short sellers", not just in regards to the Overstock company, but throughout the stock market.
I read this entire story last night, all 69 pages of it, and it certainly seems legitimate.
Was there a '"cabal" they believed were attempting to destroy their company'? I believe there was.  Did Byrne and those supporting him  think the Linux supporters were involved? I have no idea, it isn't mentioned.  Maybe mistakes were made by that group (not just Byrne), but if you take the time to read the story you may understand his paranoia, and cut him a bit of slack.  Maybe not.
My impression is that Byrne is a  real stand-up guy, who will go to great lengths in the name of justice.
Edited to add:
I might also point out that the accusations in the post above this one sound quite similar to: 
Now Gary Weiss (no relation to Janet), seems to be a rather disreputable character according to Judd Bagley's site   From the evidence, links etc. posted there I would have to lean towards the Bagley side being much more credible.  Just my opinion.  Your's may differ.

I was accused of slashing someone's tires. I didn't do it but the person who owned the car filed charges against me.
When I got to court the DA tried to get me to plead guilty to a lesser charge off to one side, and I refused. When court was in  session the judge announced that my case was going to be postponed, and the witness for the car owner was pissed! She stood up and said "I told her that he (pointing to me) is NOT the person I saw slash her tires, and I will not be returning to court and missing more work".
I got a letter in the mail the next day saying the case had been dismissed.

I am also not a tax attorney, but there's one thing that crosses my mind if you don't file a FBAR.  
If you had money on MtGox and in the future they pay out partial claims to Mt. Gox users, would not filing a FBAR complicate making a claim?
It seems to me that not filing a FBAR, and then getting paid out on a claim in the future would be a clear sign to the US government that you were trying to hide your Mt Gox BTC from the government.  
Surely any claims paid out to US citizens by Mt. Gox will be reported by the organization handling the bankruptcy and the payouts.
So, don't file a FBAR, give up any future claim on a possible payout, and still risk possible prosecution (though you may not lose because of the OP's info), enormous legal costs, and jail time.  
What a great idea!

Their reference to justify their edit:

Scroll to the bottom and you will see under Credits:
"Initiated and designed by ECOGEX".
So, they set up a web page as if it were an official page suggesting that the B they want used is official, and then edited the Wiki for the symbol to link to their page for the symbol.

Quite a while later the company read the comments and sued the guy, saying that in their TOS it states that he agreed to not post negative comments.

How about we lower the mining difficulty so coins can be mined a bit faster, and then have a "Donation" percentage option in all of the mining pools which miners can set to be given to MtGox to help bail them out?

I am talking about at a point where it is as commonly used as cash.  As long as you keep your cash in your pocket, wallet, personal safe, etc. the government has no way of regulating it.  It's the same with bitcoin, only even better, since bitcoin is electronic and can be traded without government interference around the world.  Physical cash, not so much.

You clearly didn't read the link.  I did.  But, since you work for a hedge fund, you obviously know everyone on Wall Street, every person who runs a hedge fund in this country, and every Ovewrstock trade anyone ever made.  You clearly also know more about this than Mark Mitchell of the Columbia School of Journalism.  Ever think about running for the position of Bitcoin President? I hear the position is vacant.
Oh, and Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Shapiro has done his own study, concluding that naked short sellers have vaporized as many as 1,000 companies: 
But it is totally out of the question that anyone would try to do such a thing with Overstock.com stock, right? Okay, I'll go with that since you say so and you work for a hedge fund!
You might want to consider this one quote from Mr. Shapiro's report though: " . . . there is considerable evidence that market manipulation through the use of naked short sales has been much more common than almost anyone has suspected, and certainly more widespread than most investors believe."
But, because you say so it must be out of the question that it has ever happened to Overstock.com stock. You would certainly know for certain.  We will all just take your word for it then, since you work for a hedge fund, and you would know.

Your first app? You have a bright future!  
I'm not sure how you go about generating the source, but I know people use github.com to post their open source code, so maybe sign up there?  It's free for their basic account with unlimited public repositories.  Upload the code in a zip file.  You will also probably want to include something like a MD5 hash, which I think is some sort of crypto verification of the file size so people who download it can verify it is the original file, and not one that was hacked and modified.  Someone else around here can probably guide you better on that stuff.
I know it's a pain in the ass, but it is really necessary, and once you have done it the first time and learn what to do it will be a lot easier in the future when you develop more awesome Bitcoin apps! :-)

No, a Cosair 750 will not power 2 S1's overclocked! I have tried it.  You'll need a minimum of 800W for 2 S1's overclocked.
I use one of these for every 2 S1's. You would need 3 of these DPS-800GBA-HP power supplies to power 6 S1's: 
Too bad you are in the UK. This is the easiest way to hook them up to the S1: 
If you are handy with a bit of soldering I can help you with another solution if you are interested in using the power supply in the eBay link above. Message me.
Yikes! I just noticed the price on the DPS-800GBA-HP on eBay in the UK.  Never mind. They are only $27 postage paid in the US (and sometimes they can be found for even less), and definitely an economical way to power S1's.

Yes, it is semantics, however I do believe that people just getting into the bitcoin scene can easily be misled by the statement 'provably fair', because 'fair' is not synonymous with 'provably fair'.  'Provably fair' has nothing to do with the game itself being fair, though new bitcoin users may not be aware of the difference.

I gave it 3 stars. Would have given it 5 stars but you left off Mt. Gox on the exchange list.
Just kidding. 5 Stars - Best BTC widget I have seen yet!
One suggestion.  It would be really cool if the orange Bitcoin logo was on it, maybe in the blank area between the exchange and the alarm.  Maybe an option to add or remove Bitcoin logo?  Or, what about the logo in the middle of the refresh arrows and make the arrows a larger circle, so the logo would be larger?
Not trying to be picky, but I just kind of think that having the logo on everything possible promotes the coin (in this case when showing other people the widget).  Get them familiar with the logo, so it becomes more commonplace in their mind.
One other thought. Maybe make the default color Bitcoin orange instead of blue? :-)

Why don't you read what I post?  Pleading guilty can be an action taken to avoid a harsher sentence if the case is taken to trial, rather than actually admitting to doing the crime.

They are NOT saying "Yes, i did the crime" they are saying "I don't want to go to trial for the original charges", and the judges even know this.

This article was originally published here, and could use some comments: 
@_date: 2014-08-05 18:20:01
"Although initially charged with planning six murders, Ross was not indicted in New York for any. In November prosecutor Serrin Turner used the murder-for-hire allegations to argue against bail being granted, yet he did not indict Ulbricht for these allegations in February. In addition, no victim is named in the prosecution’s complaint or the New York indictment, and the FBI affidavit states that there is no record of any actual homicide.  There is still an indictment in Maryland alleging one murder-for-hire crime. We are convinced it is false and predict that this remaining accusation of planned violence will go the way of the other five.
(Note: The murder-for-hire allegation is now an “uncharged crime” mentioned in the narcotics trafficking conspiracy section of the New York Indictment.  It is NOT a formal charge and requires no proof)."

The way I see it that spam post didn't get enough attention, so now you re-post the exact same link, only you use a much more attention getting title.  
The reason your first post didn't get a lot of attention is that most people who are serious enough about bitcoin to be here ALREADY KNOW not to use the same address twice.

Pleading guilty is often a way of avoiding a lengthily trial that could result in a much stiffer penalty/sentence if found guilty.  In this case you are admitting that the government, with their unlimited resources, has a chance of fucking up your life with an expensive trial, whether or not you actually committed the crime.
Pleading guilty means he will likely be found guilty, but it does not mean that in reality he actually committed a crime.  The US government trumps up charges all of the time in an attempt to get the accused to plead guilty to lesser charges.

It is not possible for you to give an "honest" review of anything that you profit from with your affiliate links.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:26:23
Again, it is of course semantics, but the word 'fair' is being used in place of the word 'honest'.  
Tell a friend you are going to bet $1 on a coin flip with him, but you tell him that you will only give him 75 cents if he is right, but he will lose $1 if he is wrong.
His reply will be "that's not fair", and he would be correct.  
You can say "I am telling you that you will only win 75 cents" as many times as you want, but it does not make it a 'fair' payoff.  It just makes you honest to be telling him up front that he will not be paid fairly in regards to the actual odds.
For those new to the bitcoin community it is by no meany common knowledge that 'fair' does not mean they will be paid a fair amount according to the odds of the game.

30K coins is really a drop in the bucket.  Regular mining produces about that many coins in around 8 days.

WOW! Seriously? You have ESP and can predict the future!
So, as far as you are concerned it would be better to leave up a survey putting Itex and bitcoin against each other, on the Itex site where Itex would obviously be favored, and not point bitcoin supporters there?  Then Itex would definitely come out ahead.  
This way, by posting it here and exposing the survey to both Itex supporters and bitcoin supporters, at least bitcoin has a chance.  
IF they adjust the results bitcoin loses NOTHING since Itex would be favored on the Itex site anyway.
If they deleted it then bitcoin gains, rather than the survey making bitcoin look bad since only Itex supporters took it.
I know the logic of this might escape you though.

If you have the $5k cash it would be easy to transfer it out of the country.  Not as easy as bitcoin, but it would not pose much of a problem.
Again, if it can be done with cash, then there should not be a restriction on doing the same thing with bitcoin.  Just because something is easier to do with bitcoin does not mean it needs a new regulation that does not currently apply to cash.

You can easily take them out by sending them to another address, or even a made up, invalid address.  But, you can't get those back.
You can also send them to another wallet or an exchange account that you control such as CoinBase, or Cryptsy.  Those you can get back to the original wallet if you desire.

Your story sounds about the same as mine.  I bought 1st one in March, and ordered another one yesterday for .604 BTC using the BTC I mined with the 1st one and .18 BTC left over too.  It will be here this Thursday according to the web site.
I don't pay an electric bill where I live, and I already had a couple PSUs around that weren't being used, so no extra costs there.
Also, my original investment in bitcoin was $400 back in December when it was $400 per bitcoin.  In 2 days I will have 2 Antminer S1's and .18 BTC.  I should be back to 1 BTC in about 5 weeks or less, and then whatever my 2 S1's mine forever into the future will be profit (as long as I continue to get free electricity).

Admitting he's guilty to the crime has NOTHING to do with you accusing him of being a snitch and him being guilty of that.  You have no factual information that proves this.  All you have is "I know a rat when I see one", and again, if you are a psychic then maybe you know something the rest of us are not aware of.

Their fault. After a 2 month period of time surely they don't think they will actually be able to recover anything from you.  It would seem like all they can do is ask for you to return it.
Look at it this way. What would have happened to those bitcoins if they had sent them to an invalid address, or an address that was not in use because the original owner lost the private key?  There is nobody they could contact to get them back.
I am curious as to what site is was.  Also, did they ask for the bitcoin back in a nice way, or were they demanding/threatening?

Thanks for this.  I hope it gets through to everyone who is considering getting into mining this late in the game.
I was lucky, and when I did the math recently I bailed, and got out at just the right time.  Fortunately I did a bit better with my eBay selling than you did.
I was running 3 Antminer S1s, overclocked for a total of just over 600Gh/s.  I also get free electricity, which at the point I figured all this out it didn't matter.
I don't have the exact maths in front of me, but in general what I came up with was that it would take me about a year to mine 1 more bitcoin, which was valued at about $550.  From there, with continues difficulty increases, I would not be able to mine another bitcoin with my rig in my lifetime.
Looking at eBay I could get over $600 for my 3 Antminers. So, I decided to sell.  After fees I ended up with something like $620. 
So, rather than mining for another year, mining 1 bitcoin, and then having 3 Antminers that would be basically worthless, I sold for $620, and ended up with a bitcoin @ $580 and $40 left over.
I think what the stubborn people who still say they can make money mining fail to see is how the difficulty increase is exponential, and very quickly earnings fade off to almost nothing.

That's not what I requested.  You said Byrne was "Shady as hell", and if all you have to back such a comment up is "other peoples ideas of the man", then you are being rather selective as to which "other peoples ideas" you are using to base your opinion.  
There are also a lot of people who say great things about the man.
Why is it you are picking &amp; choosing the negative comments over the positive ones?  I am still willing to listen if you happen to have a valid reason.

Treat your transaction just like any other cash transaction in regards to safety.  If the seller wants to meet somewhere that you would not be comfortable buying a physical item of the same value from him for cash, then meet somewhere else.
You will need to provide the seller with your receive address, or a QR Code on your mobile phone, etc. and it would be good to have a way to monitor the confirmations on the transaction via mobile phone, etc.  6 confirmations pretty much assures that there has not been any attempt at a double spend of the coin.
Also, if you have an Android phone I would suggest that you find a seller using the Mycelium app &amp; wallet.  It makes the transfer really easy.
Oh, and do not tell the seller what you plan on using the bitcoin for.  Just say it's an investment.

Sure, you've seen it but you clearly haven't read it.  If you had you would understand the media disinformation campaign orchestrated by those out to get him, and those hoping to profit by short selling Overstock.com stock when the price fell.  You would read about specific lies spread by MAJOR media figures regarding his poor management of the company, etc.  Based on the lies that were spread even I would think he was not very bright.  But the spreading of disinformation about Overstock.com and Byrne, no matter how often  they are repeated or by whom, does not make them true.

I have no clue. I didn't keep track that closely.  In the beginning I had no idea where this was leading, so it never really crossed my mind.  The way I look at it is I started with small purchases totaling around $200, I am having a lot of fun, and soon I will have 1 BTC ($650 or so now, and to the moon soon).  
Also, any money I spent out-of-pocket over the $200 as this progressed would have been spent on some other interest of mine of some sort anyway, so I am no worse off from that spending.  
One thing I do have in my favor is that where I live I do not pay an electric bill (not parent's basement.  Extended stay hotel).  This will keep me profitable for a while longer.

After mining with a S3 for a period of time, at what point would you sell?  
I guess I can see mining until you break even (mine .75BTC), then sell the S3.  This way whatever you get for the S3 is profit.  However it will likely take 4 to 5 months to mine .75BTC with one of these, depending on difficulty, of course.  Is anybody going to pay anything significant for an S3 at that point?

Lack of fapping is detrimental to your mental and physical health.
The part of semen which is produced in the prostrate gland, or stored in the seminal vesicles cannot be re-absorbed, and would calcify inside you is released through wet dreams. For health sake, it needs to find an out from the body. Middle age men who don't have wet dreams or sexual release, often end up with calcification or hardening of the prostrate glad and calcium stones in the seminal vesicles, which frequently ends up to be fatal prostrate cancer. More men die from cancer of the prostate gland, which travels into the body, and next shows up as bone cancer, than do women from breast cancer.

See comments above. Charlie pleading guilty has nothing to do with whether or not he actually agrees that he is a criminal.
In fact, I have no idea if the judge in Charlie's case will say this, but I have been in courts before where upon the defendant entering a guilty plea the judge askd "Are you pleading guilty because you truly are guilty?", and if the defendant replies no the judge then asks "Are you pleading guilty to avoid a possible harsher sentence if your case were to go to trial"?
Even the judge knows that a defendant entering a guilty plea does not mean the defendant is actually agreeing that he did the crime.

Hypothetically, let's say you do not rob a bank, but you are somehow involved with obtaining some cash that was taken in a bank robbery, unknown to you. 
The government catches you with this cash and trumps up the charges way beyond the actual bank robbery that occurred, in an attempt to get you to plead guilty to the bank robbery.  "You did have the marked bills in your possession, so you must be guilty of robbing the bank", says the prosecutor.
The only evidence the government actually has that you robbed the bank is that you had possession of some of the cash, and no evidence that you participated in the bank robbery, or even knew about it.  Yet, they are charging you with 12 different things that can put you in jail for 100 years, of which only 1 charge is the actual bank robbery. (This happens all of the time)
Now, they offer you a plea bargain.  Plead guilty to the actual bank robbery charge only and you will get a 10 year suspended sentence,and 2 years of probation.  Or, go to trial for all 12 charges, risk going to jail for 100 years, and run up lawyer fees to millions of dollars for your defense.
You choose pleading guilty.
Now then, do you believe that you really are a criminal?

They can ask, but he has no legal requirement to give them to anyone.  It's the 5th amendment, and his right to not incriminate himself.

That would be up to the court, and because of the 5th amendment his refusal to give up his keys cannot be used against him.

I know mobile phone text messages work this way, as did side-band CB radio channels of the past.  Surely there is some sort of less expensive solution to piggy-back the block chain on an existing frequency, and hitch a ride cheaper.

This happens every once in a while, and has been happening for quite a while now.  You are likely to find that if you try to make the same purchase after a short period of time (10 to 15 minutes) it will go through without a problem.
I have a hunch they purchase a certain number of bitcoins each day, and when they have no more coins to sell you get this message.  However, if someone sells their bitcoins to Coinbase after you get the message, they have coins to sell once again, and depending on the size of your transaction, it can now go through.
