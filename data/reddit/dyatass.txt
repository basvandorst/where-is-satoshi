The rich get rich by starting a business, or by being born into family money. This is terrible advice to have all your eggs in one basket.

No one sent you shit, but continue on with your rant, it’s quite entertaining actually.
@_date: 2019-08-07 05:17:19
And investors in bitcoin aren’t just trying to make money? What’s your point?

Good points are made in support of crypto as a legitimate investment strategy, but it is indeed a terrible idea to put 50% of your eggs in one basket. Within the stock market there are many different options that allow for diversification; not the case when owning bitcoin.

This is why it may be worth $700 to some people. Let’s say you have “dirty” bitcoin, $700 isn’t a terrible deal.

You act as if the entire stock market is the S&amp;P 500. There are plenty of inverse, small-cap companies that don't follow the normal trend lines.

If fiat suddenly becomes worthless, you will be raped and murdered before you can boot up your computer to send bitcoin.

Bitcoin is just one asset though, you can diversify between different stocks.

Pretty easy to dump they keys from Bitcoin QT (wallet.dat). 
1. First just make sure to disconnect from internet (i'm over paranoid)
2.  Open the old wallet application,Click "Help &gt; Debug window". You should see the "Debug window". 
3.  enter the command: dumpprivkey yourpublicBTDaddresshere
4. Sweep key to your electrum wallet

Because the stock market isn’t just one single instrument like bitcoin is. Contrary to popular belief, the stock market is quite diverse.
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:41:21
Where can you even buy BTC with credit cards?Hard for me to believe any company would offer this considering the fraud implications.

Let me guess, you exposed your API keys and want to blame Kraken for allowing your API keys to function as designed?

I don’t see your point, investing 50% of your portfolio in one-single Instrument of one-single assets class, is a terrible idea. Whether it be gold, bitcoin, or your company stock, the general rule is that you don’t throw  your eggs in one  basket; this is the point Kevin is trying to make.
The stock market is much more diverse than the current crypto landscape. I know we all love to hate the establishment, but let’s not pretend investing 50% of your money in bitcoin is sound financial advice.
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:35:41
You're exactly right, bitcoin IS the entire thing, and investing 50% of your money in ONE THING is not smart at all.  The stock market  consists of MANY DIFFERENT THINGS that allow you to properly diversify.
@_date: 2019-08-07 05:39:46
The stock market has tens of thousands stocks, multiple derivative instruments plus trillions in  annual volume, and you act as if its one single investment option lol.

 "If you buy stocks you buy the market."  .......Um this isn't true at all. There are many different stocks that trend differently than the overall market, there are also many different derivative instruments within the stock market. Just because you aren't making money off your Apple and Starbucks stocks, doesn't mean the stock market trends the same for everyone else.
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:36:17
So because you don't make unlimited money, you find it normal to beg on the internet?
