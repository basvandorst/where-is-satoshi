It was Halong Mining that tweeted this, about a "future" Dragonmint miner. BUT, they have never delivered a single ASIC miner in thier companies existence, the have been promising to deliver their BTC ASIC the Dragonmint 16T for months, but have yet to ship a single one.
Bitmain's A3 is shipping NOW, I have my shipping notice that it will be here next week (in Macau). I can ROI on it before Halong ever gets a miner screwed together.
Once they manage to get out their first promised and undelivered first product, I would then worry about going out to pump a second vaporware product. Haling has as much hot air as a dragon.

True, makes sense, another sobering point about how easily the Fed is basically free to inflate away our wealth. I'll keep nibbling at gold/silver/btc just to feel I have something the Fed can't devalue.

And it is just the extension of existing law prohibiting payments in any currency not issued by the Vietnam government. 
"The law also states that the only authorized payment methods in the country are those issued or controlled by the State Bank of Vietnam."
