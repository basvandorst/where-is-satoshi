@_date: 2019-07-10 20:49:04
I swear I saw it at 13k... right before I blinked
@_date: 2019-07-21 03:14:42
So what’s the connection with this sub?
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:37:12
But if it won’t drop 30%, how on Earth will I be able to buy more?
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:18:13
How many hours before 14k?
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:33:09
Love it!
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:37:29
This is way high level math for me
20k-3.8 = 16.2k     Got that
16.2k / 2 + 3.8k = how much????
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:45:12
Challenge accepted! Please send me your BTC, &amp; I will be glad to put it in my butt
@_date: 2019-03-18 02:52:16
I got 2 of these already. Looks like my ass is doubly screwed than OPs
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:36:28
The only difference is that millions of middle aged guys wanted to sleep with her.... and she’s got millions of $$$ more than me
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:37:54
Sigh... &amp; probably worth more than my account anyways :(
@_date: 2019-03-17 13:01:08
So is that a good thing or a bad thing?
@_date: 2019-03-01 18:57:56
HODL the lambo?
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:25:50
Can anyone guide me how I can move my Sats from Reddit (from people tipping me on Reddit) to BlueWallet?
@_date: 2019-03-14 03:10:49
Hello, I tried to send you the BTC, but it came back. Can I simply give you my pass key so you can take it out my account and verify my identity?
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:44:38
When in Venice, don’t do what the tourists do
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:00:03
Actually, if you can leave it on my driveway, it would be great!
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:43:38
Awesome, so how I get the free Sats? :)
@_date: 2019-11-13 13:26:45
Hopefully they retain value in a better manner
@_date: 2019-03-04 01:06:23
Lol - thank you!
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:09:57

@_date: 2019-06-20 12:35:03
And I earn BTC when I poop
@_date: 2019-10-06 00:46:46
Awesome! Just the wrong sub, no?
@_date: 2019-06-24 08:08:38
You should bet in before it crosses 6-figures
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:23:38
If you think this is poor, you haven’t been on this sub where every other day someone posts a BTC going up/down on a rollercoaster!
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:16:48
Awesome - now I can’t sleep at all
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:38:01
Wake me up when September comes
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:34:33
Yeah that’s what I’m getting at, coz the inflation will get the BTC rate up as well, so how do you (as an employee) get enough BTC to literally survive?
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:08:41
I guess that’s why they say money can’t buy you happiness!
@_date: 2019-10-18 22:45:32
What kinda blasphemy is doing your own research... if it’s good enough for a stranger on the internets, it is good enough for me.
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:12:44
You forgot to include the Boeing 777 for the year 2025

What type of phone do you have?
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:25:35
The most important thing to keep in mind is:
Charge your fuckin phone!
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:24:25
If I’d any self respect, I’d not be here on Reddit, trying to earn the useless karma and the opinions of strangers.
You did say $1MM BTC, so here’s my upvote
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:36:15
It’s like me waiting for Reddit posts about BTC breaking 90k!
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:29:15
Nice! Ummm can I score a visit to this island for an upvote?
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:54:22
Yes please I’d like to know the password to BTC. How can I send you 0.5 BTC? Should I break my coin in half?
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:12:32
Basically it’s gonna “erupt” a week after I liquidate my position
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:57:32
There’s a zero missing from the 90k
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:07:31
I’d be happy to go to wherever you’d like to spread the love.
@_date: 2019-02-19 05:46:46
I guess the answer is titties, which produce milk?
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:47:53
So you mean I don’t need to check the BTC price every 2 minutes now?
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:55:18
Jesus! The shaving of zeroes and the inflation rate is simply insane. 
I’m truly happy that Venezuela has adopted BTC in such a big manner, but my main question is how are you getting paid? Are you getting paid in Bs. (&amp; then converting to BTC) or getting paid in BTC directly?
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:44:39
I'd love to see your face, when BTC is @ 100k
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:53:55
Will bitcoin get me a hottie wife like Mnuchin?
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:41:09
You are missing a zero there.... you mean $200k right?
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:05:28
Wait why you buying at $5k? Why not 4k?
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:41:45
What’s wrong with you morons missing a zero in all the posts? BTC going 100k or McAfee gonna eat some pussy.
@_date: 2019-12-24 07:56:53
Holy fuck... this guy is spot on... here take my money
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:43:18
Waiting for 20k BTC
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:32:32
Shhhhh don’t say it loud, we don’t everyone else to jump in on this gravy train.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:36:22
Amen brother
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:09:16
Yep, just pocket change
@_date: 2019-12-24 06:41:28
What’s my name?
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:33:56
5k lasted about as long as my wife tells me, I do...
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:30:08
It was good while it lasted!
@_date: 2019-04-13 05:04:56
Will the real Satoshi please stand up
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:37:08
Fukk... now I can't sleep &amp; have to refresh every 15 seconds....BTC 50k here we come!
@_date: 2019-04-09 04:44:19
Awwww here I thought I was special and I could make $17k/month...
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:24:41
Holy fuck I want one of em 100 trillion dollar bills!
Then I can take a pic and send it to the losers in my school who didn’t think I’d ever be a millionaire....
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:04:28
This is pretty darned cool - thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:13:21
To the center of earth... or China - whichever comes first
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:10:15
Apparently someone’s buying $100M worth of it... here we go
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:54:46
Will the real BTC please stand up...
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:55:44

@_date: 2019-01-15 17:07:43
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:58:29
Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2019-01-24 04:41:03
Is this real? There’d be so much shit floating in the water....
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:49:08
Not for me unless Goldman Sachs is involved in some manner
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:18:30
WTF... does “fuck” mean something else in Chinese?
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:37:57
What is that? Are those mining rigs ? 
@_date: 2019-01-13 04:58:44
Love it

@_date: 2019-09-25 00:35:01

@_date: 2018-12-10 23:19:54
Ahhh now this seems to make more sense.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:43:15
I don’t like these lambos in da water 
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:25:55
Seriously, how? How do you get it off Coinbase? What do I need and how can I prevent my psycho neighbor from stealing my 0.1 BTC?
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:42:20
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:29:47
I still don’t get why taking back control is helpful? I’m more scared of people hacking me and my computer than some of the big exchanges 
@_date: 2019-05-20 04:08:48
I believe BTC did prove to be a hedge somewhat to the stock market. The devaluation of Yuan also helped the price and all of this probably led to the folks shorting BTC to get squeezed out. 
We are already up a 100% and got a few 100% more to go :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:13:17
Da fuk are you picking your cherries for? They not ripe yet
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:09:57
200 BTC which includes:
50 BTC for your “regular” spending
50 BTC for an Emergency fund/Long term care when you are old
100 BTC for your kids &amp; their kids
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:07:08
Wow that is something else... hang in there, we all hope things improve out there!
thank you for sharing!

Thank you kind sire!
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:21:07
HODL it for a year and see if that shit loses 80%... if not, it’s no good!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:26:34
He bet $1mil with some hedge fund, if u got that kinda dough (or those kinda balls), go for it
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:47:18

You are welcome!
