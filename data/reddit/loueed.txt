Just had a look at that one, does it have a page where you can select all the coins you want to track? View them all on one dashboard? 
Also, it looks like its using the server side to generate each page. Alt-Coin uses coin market caps API and a VueJS front-end. It also saves the users selected coins to local storage.

I hope soon there is an easy way to send micropayments ($0.01) to creators on YouTube. It would put huge pressure on Google's advertising model.
The way I see it, Add $5 (in Bitcoin) to a platform, install a chrome extension which injects a micropayments form underneath a YouTube video. Then simply clicking a button will transfer that payment to the creator. $5 would last forever and YouTubers will be able to create content without relying on Ads.

Interesting idea, but that's a workaround, btc would allow instant peer-to-peer payments without relying on visa, banks, youtube, etc. Lots of middlemen in your concept.

The issue is transaction fees, its hard to make micro-payments with the current banking system. They require a fee which would be bigger than the amount that your paying. Crypto could solve this issue, most likely with an off chain solution. Bcash and its bigger blocks wont scale very well.

ledger should force users to open the chrome ledger manager app and then select configure new device. It's currently too easy for scammers to setup a device, package it with some fake instructions and steal all your money.

Sure it's not the fake account? People can think what they want about him but its fact that he owns huge bitcoin mining setups and is fully behind the decentralised crypto mission

Mine arrived this morning. The setup was pretty straightforward.
I chose Segwit chain and transferred my bitcoins from Coinbase in about 2-3 hours. Fee's came to £2.60 for £850 of Bitcoin. Going to transfer my 3 Ether tomorrow.

The bitcoin inflation rate steadily trends downwards. At the time of writing, more than 3 out of every 4 bitcoins that will ever exist has already been mined, and the annual inflation rate is just 4%. The block reward given to miners is made up of newly-created bitcoins plus transaction fees. As inflation goes to zero miners will obtain an income only from transaction fees which will provide an incentive to keep mining to make transactions irreversible.

Can you explain why? I was lead to beileve there will only ever be 21 Million Bitcoin, so once we have mined 20 Million there will be 1 Million left to mine... 
Will the block reward always be relative to the price of the coin, even when we have 10,000 coins left to mine?
@_date: 2018-09-15 14:07:51
So when bitcoins are mined the difficulty increases because there are less coins available to mine. I dont understand how can bcash can get easier to mine over time?  
Also when we're down to the last 10,000 bitcoins, will it be too difficult to mine without an immensely powerfull computer?

I guess thats correct for iOS, but the majority of Android Phones are running outdated software, and recently someone published that a bunch of manufactures where pushing security patches to there phones which contained known exploits. Don't get me wrong, iOS can also be hacked but its a hell of a lot harder seen as over 80&amp; of iOS devices are running the newest iOS update.

Bitcoin is currently seen as a commodity because it's not ready to be a "mainstream" currency. To become a usable currency it needs to have instant payments, low transaction fees and people need to trust that the value will be the same once they payment has been made.
There are solutions to all these issues, one of which is the [lightning network](

Nicely done! Simplified it down so that most people can wrap their head around it. I liked how they also showed the bank getting a fee for what can essentially be automated.
