Does the blocksize increase though? I thought they're still 1MB block with just smaller transaction sizes due the trimmed sig data.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:08:13
Segwit does not increase the blocksize.
Edit: I stand corrected

I use cointracking which seems to be the industry standard at the moment for tax reporting software. Its automated and around$100 for the year (i think). Offers software to let you report LIFO or other ways to organize your tax liabilities to reduce them in the short term.
A lot of altcoins are most likely junk but a lot of historical indices including altcoins  vastly outperform bitcoin and ethereum alone. Those indices along with coingecko rankings are good at picking a couple good "large cap" coins to help you beat out bitcoin.
The day coinbase lists they altcoins is the day I leave binance. For now though they are among the best.
The altcoin situation regarding tax liabilities with very soon be law, if you want to make money and no go to jail in the future you gotta play ball. No big deal.

It helps when you use multiple exchanges and need to track across multiple wallets, and when you use crypto to pay for things and it becomes a taxable event that way. Or if you mine and need to separate income and the sale of assets after you receive mining income. These all need sorted.
Again, cointracking.com is extensively used by professionals who specialize in filing taxes for clients with cryptoassets. They seem to disagree with you thinking it is pointless.
And any exchanges that dont base their trades in fiat cant establish a cost basis for you and cant give you tax forms anyway. This would all be things you would realize you need to keep track of if you traded in things other than BTCUSD and ETHUSD.

Who would you reccomend using for altcoins. Binance consistently has higher trading volumes and better reviews compared to most other exchanges. US exchanges like poloniex and bittrex are consistently ranked worse, although bittrex isnt too shabby.
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:53:47
You guys need to educate yourselves. Binance moved out of China months ago.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:53:34
That doesnt matter. If I gain 2btc trading altcoins on binance I will need to report that bitcoin when I sell it on coinbase. They will want to know where I got it from. It doesnt seem to me like you have a firm grip on how to file taxes regarding capital gains.

It's not hedging their bets. Most large institutions that hold public funds have to buy from a regulated clearing house. Bakkt will most likely be the first one in existence.
This is different than other exchanges that meet certain regulations for private, accredited investors. 
This means with bakkt, people that hold pensions. 401k, etc. (These are enormous compared to what is currently exposed to bitclin) will be able to add bitcoin to their portfolios.
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:29:12
They have rules they cant buy and hold the bitcoin themselves as they dont meet custodial requirements.
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:31:25
Gambling lol
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:22:15
That's why BAKKT is going to be regulated. Its pending regulatory approval from the CFTC. Heres a source :
 
Participating in the unregulated space is illegal if your a regulated fund, they would go to prison if they dumped investors money into something that's not approved.
Not sure if your trolling or what but this information is all readily available if you've been keeping up with the regulatory stage these past few months.

Tethers are distributed on the omni protocol though, so the accounting books would need to match up to how they're distributed on that. The concern was that too many tether would be printed relative to how much money they had, so they need to check the tokens distribution on a blockchain protocol and verify it against a physical banking record, and this should be done by an accountant who can catch stuff they may be hiding. Not a law firm. But verifying blockchain records still isnt a piece of cake, if though it has transparency advantages compared to legacy systems.
@_date: 2018-10-19 21:31:33
How do you know that?
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:36:59
They have explicitly said they are not doing this. People are being very critical of how bakkt handles things and once they release their legal paperwork for clearinghouse rules it will be obvious what they're doing. Stop spreading FUD by some YouTube doofus and educate yourself.
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:49:26
I mean it's about as easy as it comes in terms of Google searches but here ya go:
An accounting firm just needs to check their balances to make sure they have the money they say they do. Tether never did this. They have also had their code audited by trail of bits to ensure the burning and distribution functions will work like they say it will in the white paper.
DYOR everyone!!! Reddit is not the place to be getting your information.
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:50:09
It can absolutely be audited.

If you buy something that you find out that it did not perform as advertised. If the seller knows this and lies to you that would be fraud. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:14:36
Yea that's true, itd probably be really hard. Especially when they have to track so many people.
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:19:39

Bitcoin is pretty easy to track though, I just dont think the IRA is very good at it but some companies are, so its only a matter of time. But privacy coins are a different story

That's illegal they're institutional investors they have protocol to follow because it's not their money.
They're not all "genius" investors. You give them too much credit.

While it doesnt pay out dividends, the assumption that there are no fundamentals to value these assets with is just wrong. These coins have value and will increase in value as their protocols and blockchains become more widely adopted. 
Not sure why your at this sub if you believe it to be a fools dream.
@_date: 2018-10-02 02:54:41
They did this three years ago. Why does this one make a difference.

You can also program USD into smart contracts, so ethereum could power USD transfers between dApps or for anything really
@_date: 2018-10-27 20:13:58
Spending it is supposed to be a taxable event but until they get really good at tracking who spends what where they wont necessarily know what your doing.
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:22:44
They check all their transactions though and make sure they have the money. That's all the audit would be.
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:22:48
Well not entirely, that was a law firm. It really should be done by an accounting firm with expertise in crypto. These can be hard to come by but its definetly do able and these new stablecoins are regulated by the state of new york as well so these auditing standards will become more robust as they continue their audits. 
The two major complaints about that report was that it was done by a law firm with no experience in crypto matters as far as I can tell, and they only did it on one exact day. So tether may have been ok in the short term but have they been compliant over the long term? Very hard to say as they keep changing banks and switching their USD policies so they aren't nearly transparent enough.

What are you talking about?There are more ethereum nodes than there are btc nodes. 
Do these count partial nodes too? Are there any sites that count full vs partial?

They are also working with the CFTC to regulate clearinghouse rules as a standard patent. If they dont commingle assets and they're all physically backed, and then the CFTC requires this as part of their bitcoin clearinghouse regulation, then it will literally be the best situation imaginable for bitcoin to be exposed to the mainstream financial market.
I really wish everyone didnt just upvote the nonsense stuff and research this themselves. It's not hard and meanwhile comments like yours arent at the top. Oh well.
@_date: 2018-10-20 16:08:48
I thought with the new geth update it doesnt take that long. Last time I ran a full node it took less than a day to download everything

Its enforced through an issuance protocol that everyone basically votes on. If people cant agree then it will hard fork like bitcoin cash did and who knows what will happen. I would imagine that the real bitcoin will stay with the hard cap because that is so far a major driver or what gives it value.

Let's be honest though. If you woke up from a coma 5 years from now the first thing you would want to know about is your cryptocurrency portfolio.

Or maybe, a company is created called "Ford 2.0+" and says "we're the actual ford because we build cars like the original founders would have wanted!!!" It's certainly different in that the code is open source for bitcoin but what Roger is doing is just ridiculous.
