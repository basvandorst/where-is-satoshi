for once we're seeing an increase in price during shallow trade volumes during a weekend (U.S.), do you think this momentum will continue, or will we still be seeing moderated peaks and troughs for around another year before a clear upswing closer to what happened 2014-2016?
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:58:41
This large dip likely had something to do with the 1 billion dollars worth of coins that was being moved around into smaller portions and then sold, we haven't seen the last of pump and dumps, and we haven't seen the last of large whale dumps, but it just creates better buying opportunity
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:06:48
Or maybe people are assuming the news is what caused the sell off and not a few individuals or groups that had planned on doing it anyway
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:58:41
I love how people are bitching about the market not turning around yet when the crash of 2014 took around 2 years to actually clearly start ticking up again. Look at the improvements and adoption, look at the hash rate. Bitcoin actually has developers working on it and a solid small community that wants to see it succeed, so if you want to be part of the next 1000%+ increase you're gonna have to waddle through the bottom.

My first Trezor hard wallet came in today! Transferred my bitcoin to it and it was very smooth and easy, would highly reccomend! Was torn between trezor and ledger s, and even though i haven't used ledger yet, i can attest that trezor works flawlessly!
@_date: 2019-03-16 23:43:37
And you believe this because of one graph of 30 day returns? 
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:02:58
You might not like it but coinbase makes it easier for most people to buy and sell crypto that don't have a lot of info on bitcoin and other coins. You must realize most people still do not understand crypto very well and any service that makes it easier for people that aren't super into crypto helps.
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:02:56
I've been following crypto since 2010 my man, I've seen almost every up and down for every crypto that's ever been made. My question is why anyone would invest or use tether when it has proven to be anything but legitimate, it has NOT proven itself, especially considering it defeats the whole purpose of crypto, it shouldn't be "attatched" to anything. Every time a fiat currency does a "gold standard" move, it doesn't last long, so why would it work for crypto?
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:01:56
I think the main issue is your lack of grammar skills. You gotta be smart enough to understand decentralization and the concept of free will and decision making that humans are prone to. It's unproven that tether is actually pegged to anything and now that it has slipped there isnt much they can do to gain trust back in the short term

Oh ok Amadeus lets add an to the list as well since you must be a wizard knowing everything already... oh wait i bought BTC at 178 bucks so im already winning sheitttt
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:09:31
Now that the price of bitcoin seems to be stable compared to a clear bull or bear run, is there any new technology coming down the pipe? I know the lightning network continues to grow, but im unaware of any new updates to bitcoin otherwise, could anyone fill me in? Sorry if there's another easy place to find this.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:04:36
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:49:31
So Tethers's crash seems to be pumping bitcoins price at a pretty substantial premium
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:37:04
I don't think it's unrealistic to expect another round of huge gains considering its a global currency and other countries that are developing (assuming bitcoin is successful) will keep expansion going and increase demand which in turn increases price. Now I'm not saying its going to cyclically continue 1000% gains yearly, that is unrealistic, but its ability to grow is still massive considering the small market cap it has right now (nowhere near the cap of infrastructure and housing). Most people today still don't know what bitcoin even is and if they have heard of it, they usually don't know more than it's an "internet speculative investment", if bitcoin or some other coin becomes a normal part of life, it has a ways to go in my opinion, not to mention its software can change with the time and solve problems that come up along the way while reducing transaction costs and possibly drawing huge institutional investors
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:38:11
thanks for the info! ill get to researching some of these
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:47:16
Im somewhat confused how tether was trading at .9 cents to a dollar and somehow regained value to about .975 cents, if it broke its "tethered" price range why are people buying it? I understand its used to make bitcoin purchases but why not go through a different exchange? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:54:21
Bitfinex premium sitting $7,500 at the moment
@_date: 2018-10-13 22:04:00
The peaks and troughs have been getting longer for bitcoin so I dont know why everyone is expecting a multi-thousand dollar recovery anytime soon, it may run up a few thousand between now and December but classically bitcoin will likely trade sideways for a few or many months before a solid uptick in price (assuming nothing big changes for adoption).
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:14:30
Look I'm not trying to say its completely stupid, but what if the dollar collapses? What if people aren't trying to get fiat out of their investments? Although most probably are, there isn't a lot of trust in the global banking systems in place at the moment. I think there is a legitimate case for crypto becoming a monetary system of its own adjacent to the classical banks that exist today. If tether is pegged to the dollar and the dollar collapses then what good is tether even in the crypto world?

"Fam, our milestone counter is too short, what can we do?" Dont worry just add "greater" to a bunch of milestones and make it wayyy bigger that way the curve doesn't look dumb as fuck. "Wow thanks jeff"

yea prob for the better you're right

Go for it. do some research into the space first though, only invest into one full coin if you're purely speculating with no research done.

how are people still falling for these simple scams.. its almost 2020
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:18:55
if you have more than $50 worth of bitcoin or are planning on buying that much just buy a trezor or ledger hardware wallet, it's so easy to do and costs next to nothing
as for a software "hot" wallet, I really don't know
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:07:43
I don't think they really ever made a difference, the people that trade enough to make moves that matter aren't dumb (most of them) but it is nice to see upward movement for an extended period now

Jablaze it
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:34:03
if its gonna pop anywhere it would likely be back to around 6,300, then gradually climb for awhile

Harsh words for someone who can't see the value in an asset uncontrolled by any central power, do you even know what a stock represents in legal terms?

Exactly. This isnt really that surprising at all, I was surprised it didn't happen sooner
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:34:46
You are delusional if you think big money has made its way into bitcoin on a large scale. Not to mention the long term adoption possibilities as the rest of the world develops
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:18:25
Countless news articles based on no facts whatsoever. Read the bitcoin white paper, study up on the software and maybe, just maybe, you'll realize that its price is arbitrary and the underlying technology is the real value. The price reflects what someone is willing to pay, you will see its value in the future whether or not you are in it when it happens
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:29:24
Everyone was predicting 5k prices for awhile and everyones acting like shit's insane. Remember the drop from 1000 to 223 dollars? This isnt anything new and if anything its just like buying at a discount

I really don't understand what is keeping most of these alts alive when they just follow bitcoins trends to the letter, they exactly follow what bitcoin does so why dont investors look to bitcoin instead?
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:12:17
That's exactly what someone who lost a lot would say, its clear you have a negative bias and are trying to influence others with your mistakes. Im willing to listen if you present facts but just using different venmo versions isnt going to change my position.

Does anyone know of any research specifically pertaining to the correlation between bitcoin searches and acceleration of change in price? Im not saying Bitcoin and Buy/sell volume, rather, the magnitude of which changes occur faster when search history goes up?

I called this pull up last week but I will be very surprised if we break 6,500 without a decent pullback
