Ok now pull up a graph showing US population growth in that same time period (excluding 2008 onwards, obviously).

Take a short, folks. 
Shit's gonna get corrected like an essay paper.

Might be a bit pessimistic here but I wouldn't be too surprised if it drops to &lt;900 by next week. Growth like this really is unprecedented and we're going to see a bunch of movers get off their asses with these prices.

Dude's gunna regret it.
Are we still so confident that this price is stable?
Unpopular opinion I know but I don't think we've arrived at a 1000+ coin.

1000+ wasn't stable and it *still isn't*. The price is going through some major corrections but I wouldn't count on it staying this high for a while. 
Bitcoin needs more time to become ~1000 stable.

Inflation is a natural part of a growing economy and GDP, you can't escape it regardless of system of Banking. The only thing that matters is that wages rise along with inflation as well.

Too bad he would've been fundamentally against the concept of a blockchain. Friedman was pure monetarist and believed in rigid central banking.

Look back i probably wasn't clear enough on what i meant.
Are there any sites where i just digit a couple numbers on my credit card and i automatically buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:41:55
I remember finding out about bitcoin back when it was 90 dollars for one. I don't feel bad for not buying one because i couldn't and still can't. Kinda irks me though...
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:58:49
I feel really stupid for asking this.
 Is there any site where i can directly physically buy Bitcoins with a debit card? If not what's the closest there is and is it easy to walk through?
