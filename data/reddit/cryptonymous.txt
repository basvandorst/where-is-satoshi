I myself am a teenager interested in bitcoin, but with the stigma attached to that label in American society I would hate to have bitcoin associated with "teenagers".

I mean, if they promised high returns quickly, that would be a reason to worry. This is a reason to believe that they're doing actual mining and not a Ponzi scheme.

It's TOR and BTC, even if it was nobody there gives a fuck.

Imagine the paperwork and infrastructure that you would need to setup such a tip service using traditional payment methods. With Bitcoin you just need a bot.

Yes, and some idiots actually downvoted you. That formula assumes that you can make all your hash attempts unique, which you can't. Actual probability is 1-(0.9999999999999999519703814344946)^(total hashes), assuming that NicolalS1993's number for the probability of finding a block each hash is correct. 
So you're 50% likely of finding a block after (log 0.5) / (log 0.9999999999999999519703814344946) = 14431661155388805.682960586156826 hash attempts.

I mean, the difference is BTC is worth actual money, or you could use it to buy actual happiness on Silk Road. And you can tip more if you figure out the percentage of people who don't redeem their tip and adjust accordingly.

Well, scientifically it's true: *Homo sapiens* originated in Africa.

I'll play devil's advocate here. Bitcoins are limited, however other cryptocurrencies will always be made, some with advantages over BTC. The supply of cryptocurrencies as a whole is unbounded. If bitcoins are too expensive to be useful, people will use cheaper cryptocurrencies since their usefulness as a means of transfer is the same. The world may even switch to a different cryptocurrency. A drop in demand like that could severely impact value.

"This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer." 
So let's say the next memory block allocated holds executable code (or a function pointer) and then the one after that takes input from the network. Then you have remote code injection.
