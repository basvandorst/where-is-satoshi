What is "idiotic" and what is "wonderful" is for the consuming populace to decide.  They vote with their dollars.

Libertarian does not equal Republican.  Try again.

There is a statist-anarchist dichotemy.  You are one of the other.  Historically, statism will eventually evolve into something awful.

Lol.  MUH ROADZZZZZ!!!
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:09:39
Fuck no.  One is a conservative movement whose economic ideology is muddy and centrist (as in "Cut spending...but don't you dare take MY Medicare!), while the other is a highly thought out and decidely less political movement.  One key difference is that, while the Tea Party seeks to elect every Tom, Dick, and Harry who claims to be conservative, we look to a...[DIFFERENT]( method for social change.  Hence our support for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:03:22
Anarcho-capitalism has nothing to do with the Tea Party.
Source: I am the former, and was the latter.

Lol.  Whatever breh.
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:56:51
I think you're missing the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:11:54
So what?

Why do we give a shit about what TP says?  They are a statist lobbying group.  Fuck them.
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:31:48
You don't think businesses would see a need to pay for roads themselves?  How would they transport their goods?  In the end, businesses would pay for their own roads.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:36:26
Maybe with libertarians, but not with Ancaps.  We go much farther than libertarians are willing to go.

I hope you realize how dumb you are with this shit.  Can't wait to see you fail.

So fuck the Foundation too.

Not all ancaps ae agorists, true, but many would like to do seasteading or something else rather than wean people off government all together.

If bitcoin is good, then it shall survive.  If not, it won't.  The market will figure it out.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:18:45
Yes, let's all let the government in on Bitcoin, something they either already don't like, or will eventually not like once they realize they can't control it.  Such logic, wow.

* Not sure, using VMware version 9, ESXi is v5.1.
* Yes.
* Yes.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:29:53
Or you could use it anyways.  How are they going to know who deals in Bitcoins or not?  Especially if they use software like the upcoming Dark Wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:43:55
If you break contract, a person has a right to take corrective action.  I wouldn't suggest violence, no, but rather arbitration.
But that's polycentric law, and you won't support that if you support a social contract.  There.  Saved us days of debate right there.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:02:25
And if I'm not satisified, I must move?  What contract did I sign?  I didn't sign shit.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:36:35
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:42:51
They're running scared...
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:31:06
I'll keep my coins away from any government, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:46:54
To be able to get his Dell 2950's to run it, because they are running ESXi.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:13:00
Bullshit.  If I hire a man to build a porch, I have made a contract.  If I then refuse payment, IE breaking the contract, I may then claim back what I built, or rather destroy it in this case.  Both parties respect that they will follow through with a contract,or else suffer aeverse consequences.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:40:41
It can, but he wishes to run it in VM because the computer is used for ESXi.
EDIT: Not graphics card, but computer itself.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:15:02
So what you're saying is that instead of a actual contract, you just have more people with guns forcing the minority to do what they say?  Yep, that's some nice little authoritianism right there.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:31:23
And I disagree.  But again, polycentric law.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:19:49
The problem is that I don't want any government EVEN REMOTELY INVOLVED in it.  Getting them involved wouldn't be "smooth", it would be a train wreck from the moment they realized they CAN'T CONTROL it.  That's the problem with central banks, and that's why they hate bitcoin.  Pandora's Box has been opened, and centralized currency is going to fail as a result.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:55:58
Does it matter?  [Don't be like this guy.](
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:22:37
Love it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:23:53
Such censorship, wow.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:00:27
And what is to say that the government finds bitcoin infringing on the liberty of the individual, because it can be used for illegal things?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:30:35

@_date: 2013-12-10 19:58:31
Yes, like having banks and governments ban my dealings with them would be a bad thing.  I'll just have my customers pay in bitcoin, and then use an exchange to get dollars or what have you out of it.  Or not.  I might just keep my bitcoins.  Regardless, it doesn't matter to me.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:04:55
I'll find out what his specific setup is tomorrow when I talk to him next.
He knows that it isn't profitable, but he thinks it's interesting, and so he isn't really caring about the profitability here.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:41:11
Why would anyone do business with one who does not?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:51:25
If you feel like you can get away with it, sure.

If my house isn't my property, then neither is his body.  It goes out the door.

Too scary.  Need.  Government.  To hold me.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:09:24
Did somebody say "MUH ROOOOOADSSSS!"
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:37:36
He used to be fine back in his Objectivist days.  Now, he's just shades of Robert Stadler.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:36:28
Look at you, assuming what a person is.  Assuming makes an ass out of you, but not me in this case.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:45:16
Reality is that a contract is not valid if it has one of those three parameters.  Enforcing an invalid contract by force is authoritarian, yes
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:17:27
Any libertarian willing to use the State to use force against another individual is not a libertarian at all.  In fact, using a system you do not believe in for any sort of change is hypocritical.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:59:17
If he doesn't respect your property, should you then respect his?  No.  His body is also his property, and you can throw it outside.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:09:20
He should run it under the radar, like on a black market site or something.  Then again, they are probably watching him, so....yeah.  The empty coin idea isn't a bad one.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:35:20
Pathetic.  "I've given up on debating a group of people due to a stereotype."  Pathetic.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:10:18
Not to mention all the embargos, sanctions, tariffs, and other protectionist policies that governments do.  Yay bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:54:32
Ok.  Your point is?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:52:44
You broke into that guy's private property.  Under a social contract, I can't even do what I'd like on MY OWN property.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:08:38
No, that makes it terrible.  Just look at every other currency out there.  Decentralized currency is the best currency, as you can't print endless amounts of it, it is anonymous (or nearly so), and governments can't seize it or attack it's printer if everyone is a printer (so to speak).  This is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:13:02
So no point at all then.  K.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:37:00
K.  That's real fucking neato.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:46:30
Imagine a scenario where you can't buy food, water, or anything because you have a reputation for not honoring a contract.  Yes.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:23:54
I can just look at the dollar and every other centralized currency to tell you how bad of an idea that is, but whatever.  You believe what you wish to believe.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:38:20
It's fun though.  It's like fish in a barrel, but only if you have the intellectual capacity to do so.  Not sure you do.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:11:03
Why would I want to pay my taxes in Bitcoin?  Taxes are theft, and I don't want the government having any more Bitcoin than they already do.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:30:17
I disagree.  Why can't human beings decide which government they wish to be a part of?  Why does geographical location matter?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:35:51
This allows us to ignore their ignorant, naive school of thought.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:36:36
I'm not saying that.  I'm saying that I don't want any government getting involved in it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:00:39
If they wish to try, then sure.  But don't hide it behind cuddly terms like "social contract" when it isn't actually a contract.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:34:24
I was not born in someone's attic, and I also never had a chance to agree to one.  I was born in this country, and I was assumed into this contract at birth.  In the US, a contract is null and void in any court of law if it is a) signed under coercion, b) signed without having been given a chance to look at the terms, or c) if the person signing it is not cognizant enough (i.e. too young or mentally unfit) to understand the terms.  The social contract has all three criteria, meaning it is an invalid contract.
