So they're preloaded crypto wallets that spend like a debit card?

The thing I think it solves is the fact crypto is confusing and daunting to learn about to the average person. This keeps them from finding an exchange, getting authenticated, buying crypto the transferring it to cold storage. 
This is something anyone could do. Even the unbanked.

I suppose it is just a wallet. You could secure it and transfer funds off in investments if you needed to. 
I would hope there's a safe way to have the keys without a record somewhere.

Mine still doesn't get how it works. She's only put a very small amount of her savings in it. She's warming up though. It helps that she sees oversight and corporations getting involved now and spending money in the space. 
It's actually funny how much more legitimate it looks when governments start treating it like it is real.

I'm not thinking the company is corrupt. It's if there are flaws or weaknesses in the technology. Who or what is creating the key and making the chip key obtainable and how will data on an app really stay safe? Where is all of that information and how accessible is it?

Hmmmm. So how do you spend .05 BTC when it's worth $20k again or maybe $50k.

This is where I wish I had more knowlege and experience in the latest technology. I just don't understand how that it possible, but I want to understand it before I buy it.

I do not want that utopia. The world needs too much accomplished to stop work. This is not a free lunch.
