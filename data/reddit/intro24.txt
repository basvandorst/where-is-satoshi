So two days? I'm talking about not wanting to be able to touch it for months or years
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:29:08
He can't exactly cash out. People will be watching those coins
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:54:56
Would you consider donating some to the [surface of the Moon](
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:27:53
How are schmeckles not actually a real coin yet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:08:40
I'm not alone... some of the comments I've seen. I could do it but if there were a way to make it impossible I'd much prefer that so I don't have to be anxious about it
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:31:52
There's a clip of him describing the future of Bitcoin as unpredictable like how the internet eventually ended up being used to livestream protest footage from a drone. Anyone know where he said that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:46:27
Not sure what you mean
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:51:05
I made it clear I still had private keys. And there's no intrinsic ownership in me giving them a copy of what are technically my private keys. I just allowed them the opportunity to send it to a new secure wallet if they wanted. This was a required gen ed so you can imagine the disinterest at the time
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:00:45
I could do that but what I really want is to be locked in
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:46:06
The idea was that they send it to a new wallet if they wanted to keep it cause obviously I could still have the private keys. I made that clear when handing them out
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:13
He could maybe cash out some but I don't think it would look too good if the poster boy for Bitcoin advocacy didn't hold onto his. I'm shocked that he doesn't many Bitcoin to begin with though
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:18
I like my Coinbase account. But even if I did I'd be able to create a new one. I know there's lots of preventative measures but I'm looking for something that makes it nearly impossible so I don't have to worry about it because otherwise I will
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:59:57
A new pineapple can also grow from the stem of an old one and it takes years to do. So that kind of relates to Bitcoin taking time to mature and being dependent on past transactions
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:46:17
Ok yeah true I guess
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:16:23
Reminds me of this [scene](
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:50:39
Awesome. That's exactly what I'm looking for
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:08
Yeah, I don't think he would. But he's effectively still not a Bitcoin millionaire because he can't really touch those coins. He'll still have to pay bills through Patreon support and such
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:18:34
What does BCH stand for?
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:52:49
So... which one is the "cool" one? And what happens with addresses, can you send bcash to a Bitcoin address and vice versa?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:02:46
I think a big problem is that there's no term to refer to a public address / private key pair and so the term "wallet" generally gets used. This is reinforced by the fact that paper wallets only have one associated key pair
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:49:12
That's my thought too. To me it seems like being able to decrypt this without the private key, or being able to brute force the private key would mean Bitcoin is broken. Aside from quantum computers possibly posing a threat it seems pretty secure
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:21:00
So is BCH and BCC the same thing?
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:49:53
You sure? Thought there was a known date when all Bitcoin would be mined
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:10:04
Ok, I always thought after 1 it would just drop to 0
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:57:38
I'm trying to asymmetrically encrypt data with a 64-character private key (limited physical space) while still having SECRET or TOP SECRET grade strength. ECC seems well suited and Bitcoin is a proven implementation, not to mention having a Bitcoin address also attached to it allows for donations. Open to other suggestions though
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:04:13
Sorry for such a basic question but is a shorter message more easily cracked? If so it seems like I could just encrypt a single letter with someone's PGP public key then brute force it to get their private key and that doesn't seem to be the case
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:54:16
Right, it's still extremely secure, it's just a lot less secure than it is if you don't spend and reveal the public key that generated your public address
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:47:22
I've asked around and researched a lot and before you spend, your public *key* is unknown, whereas your public *address* is what you publicly show to receive BTC. A public address cannot easily be used to derive a public key and it certainly can't be used to derive a private key without first deriving the public key. Therefore an attacker would need to first derive the public key from the public address (something that there is no known way for quantum computers to do) and then derive the private key from the public key (something quantum computers could do). So by making your public key available, your private key is now more susceptible to attack, particularly from quantum computers. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something though, does this sound right?
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:48:44
That confused me a bit. I'm just trying to figure out if spending from a wallet that hasn't already been spent from *slightly* compromises that wallet's security. Would you agree with that point or is what you're describing a security measure that mitigates the vulnerability of wallets that have sent Bitcoin? I get there are less public addresses than there are public keys and so some public keys will have the same public address, right?
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:07:32
But my understanding is that any time you send Bitcoin the public key is publicly visible on the blockchain. Also, there's no way to get a private key from a pubilc key without an inconceivably powerful brute force attack, right? So it seems pretty darn secure to me, albeit slightly less secure than if you were to only share your public address
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:50:49
But as things are now, if something gets imbedded it would be hard to refute
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:08:53
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:51:41
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:07:24
You could do that. Might be expensive though, and anyone could see the noise
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:49:23
Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:52:02
Ok, so it sounds like spending once introduces the possibility of using a non-random number, which would compromise the private key. And even if your first spend used a properly random number, spending a second time introduces the possibility of accidentally re-using that same number from the first spend, which would also compromise the private key. Right?
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:03:41
Love that account
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:56:24
Right, just if it could be made reasonably secure it would be useful to make a Bitcoin private key do double duty. You raise some good concerns though. Security is tricky
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:13:07
Yep, I was just thinking about the online wallet generators and paper wallets, which just give you one private key and a corresponding public address. I'm not sure what the proper word would be for referring to a private key / public address pair but you're right that "wallet" isn't quite right
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:28:18
Good point but I think you could leave out most legitimate transactions and only focus on the ones sent to no one. i.e. I'm pretty sure it's easy to tell what is intentionally encoded information and I don't think it's nearly enough to represent all possibilities
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:35:00
Awesome, that makes things make a lot more sense. So to make sure I understand correctly, say I have Wallet A with 5 BTC and then generate Wallet B with 0 BTC to start. You're saying by sending the 5 BTC from Wallet A to Wallet B, I *slightly* compromise the security of Wallet A because now Wallet A's public *key* is recorded publicly on the blockchain. Meanwhile, Wallet B hasn't sent any Bitcoin (only received) so only Wallet B's *address* (a non-reversible hash of Wallet B's public key) is publicly recorded on the blockchain. Wallet B's public *key* remains unknown until Wallet B *sends* Bitcoin to some other wallet. Is that correct?
As I understand it, this is only a security concern because a quantum computer could conceivably use my public *key* to derive my private key, whereas there is no algorithm (yet) to allow a quantum computer to derive my private key from my public *address*, since creating a public address from a public key uses a non-reversible hash
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:04:02
Ok I think I get it. However if I use something like walletgenerator.net it only generates a single private key and corresponding public address and calls that a "wallet", which is how I was using the term. Are you saying most wallets have features that allow them to contain multiple private key + public address combos? Is there a proper word for referring to a private key + public address combo?
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:09:44
Happy to be here, it's good to get away from the iPad jokes and Old Spice ads from time to time
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:37:19
It'd be really cool if one of the blockchains actually *was* an AI. Because apparently some part of the bible says a universal currency is the sign of the devil but it could actually turn out that a currency *itself* is the devil and not just a sign of it
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:16:37
Right, agreed on all that. I get that it's "less secure" but it certainly still seems plenty secure for simple uses
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:04:24
Don't even get me started on Satoshi conspiracies...
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:54:17
While this is wayyy far fetched, I like the idea of it because some people say that Bitcoin is a sign of the devil because supposedly one universal currency means the apocalypse is coming. What's interesting is that Bitcoin, if this were the case, would *in itself* literally be the devil, a decentralized Skynet-like AI
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:43:22
I like the theory that time travel is possible but that nothing can be changed. And it's not some mystical force of the universe that strikes down people that try to change it either. It's just that what has happened has already happened. There may have been unknown time travelers lurking but they definitely weren't in places we have a  record of. Also, it may be that only data can be sent back
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:59:30
...um, really? Can that actually be confirmed? The site seems pretty sketchy
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:01:09
I think it's definitely a privacy risk and possibly a security risk, because if you spend from the same address it's easy for human error to compromise the security. If everything were done right and the private key didn't get stolen in the process of spending, there's no added privacy risk. But both of those are realistically very possible or at least concerning enough that it's worth creating a new address since it's so easy
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:14:45
Something tells me that guy would have known what happened to MtGox if he was really from the future...
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:01:16
Awesome, thanks. Why did it do that though?
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:45:03
Thanks. Up to 4 confirmations now so that went faster than expected. Still no bitcoin balance in Cryptsy though
