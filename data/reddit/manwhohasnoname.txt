Depends on your definition of success.  If you define success as creating an easy way to villify your political enemies, while supplementing income so you can keep taxes down, then it's been a great success.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:45:30


No, it started when I said there was a use of force to participate in the central banking system.  We've already clearly defined that my definition of the use of force is looser than your definition; your definition is strict while mine was not as strict.  Do we need to re-hash that?


"Requires" through the use of force, yes.


Technically, yes, but that doesn't change that there is an aspect of force involved (admittedly once certain criteria are met).


Once I do, though (or if I do something more lucrative than turnips), I'm fucked.


Living on less than $10,300 a year and *dumpster diving* are not my ideas of living like a king.  In fact, $10,300 is underneath the definition of "Poverty" in this country.  
Either way, though, *once you earn above that amount* (this should satisfy your pedantic argument), there's *force* involved.  Even when you don't, the level of difficulty becomes great enough that I'd consider it akin to force (even if you could technically say it wasn't).
Whether or not this is a bad thing *is a separate discussion* and you just can't seem to keep the two separate.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:23:27


Um, yes.  And as far as I know there is no requirement that I purchase air or grow it.  I can consume it free of charge, and therefore don't require USD to obtain it.


Who the fuck said that?  I said "I need to eat" which necessitates that I use USD.  The arguments against that would be "Well, you could barter" - No, IRS "technically" wants their cut there, so taxes, therefore USD.  Next argument - "You could grow your own" - Sure, but then I'd need land, which comes with property tax, so taxes, and therefore USD.
I'm *not* arguing that anyone owes me anything.  My argument is *simply* that in order to *survive* as a citizen of the United States, I *must* at some point use USD, and therefore USD is forced upon me as a citizen.  That was my *only* argument.  I cannot fathom how you interpreted that to mean anyone owes me anything.


No there's not, but that's not the dichotomy you initially proposed.  Initially it was "if you don't like it, GTFO or *die*".  **THAT** is bullshit.


Correct.  I feel like this statement somehow implies that I'm *not* doing other things, which you can't possibly glean from this conversation.

It doesn't *ruin* it, because many places WILL accept it.  But it does *reduce* it, because $100 bills are less valuable than other types of currency (since some places won't accept it).  In a situation where you are at a gas station and only have $100 that they won't take, would you accept $98 from a stranger to break it for you or would you search for a place that WILL take $100?  At the bank, would you prefer to be given $20 bills over $100 bills?  If you answered yes to either of these (be honest, even if it's just with yourself), then you can see how the fungibility of $100 is slightly less than $20, $10, $5 or even $1 bills.
@_date: 2016-08-20 11:35:49
I don't think it fully *defeats* fungibility, but if coins are accepted or rejected based on their history, then certain bitcoins will end up separated from others just by way of their historical use.
Dollars doesn't have that problem because banks can't intrinsically track money inside *other* banks, so when the money is mingled and comes out the other side, there's no *publicly* accessible trail to determine where that money came from 2, 3 or 4 steps ago.

@_date: 2016-08-20 11:48:29
Because fungibility means that the commodity in question is indistinguishable from other commodities with the same "face value".  Cash isn't fully fungible because some coins/notes are more valuable than others due to numismatics.  Bank account balances are basically 100% fungible because $100 = $100 no matter what.
However, in a fully traceable scenario, the history of some units of the currency could make those units worth less than other units of the currency since the history behind them may cause some people to reject them as payment.

Yea, anyone who is hip to bitcoin would be wary of such a transaction.  Once someone is in possession of a private key, there's literally *0* way to tell if that person remains in possession of that key or not.  Buying the key would mean that between the time you buy the key and the time you create the transaction to send it to your own wallet, the seller has the opportunity to transfer coin to another address that *only* he controls.

So, assuming I am referring to a societal need, and not an individual one, then *yes*, we are *forced* to use USD because of taxes.


And MY AIM WAS NARROW AS WELL; to show that the central bank is not the same as a bitcoin exchange.  That **I** did.  Additionally, after reflection, your three options aren't viable; what if all family is dead, and after two weeks of begging everyone says no?  Dumpster diving is illegal.  So there exist some people for whom not one of your options is viable.


Not on a societal basis; only on an individual one (and they don't apply to everyone).  And your definition of force, if applied to say, the police, would be that THEY aren't forcing you to comply either.  You always have the choice of *death*.  Your definition of force is too narrow.


And how do you convince people to vote for your ideals if you don't voice them?  And maybe I voice my ideals to hone my arguments; maybe the goal here isn't to change the entire US's concept of money with a reddit post.


So once we make a decision, it can never be changed?  You don't have a solid grasp on democracy (or the fact that we aren't actually a democracy, but more like an [oligarchy](


So telling you that you are wrong when you say libertarians don't like big businesses is an attempt to completely change the minds of others?  That's a stupid assertion.


No, you are saying it out of boredom and a desire to argue pedantics.  While I too enjoy arguing pedantics on occasion, I'm not narcissistically deluding myself into thinking it's for other people's benefits.
I'll try this again, but fully expect you'll continue to argue every point in this post:
**If** I make a private transaction, **then** the government *forces* me to pay them taxes IN USD.  This includes *every* transaction where goods change hands.  Argue the pedantics of that.

I was talking about *food*.  You really need to work on your reading comprehension.


Your three "hints" all necessitate that I take without giving in return.  That's not economy, that's charity.  


You're missing the *fucking point*.  You keep trying to force the argument to be whether or not you owe me something.  You don't.  Quit fucking trying to change the discussion.  My *only* point is that in order for me to be a functioning member of society, I *will* have to use USD at some point or another.  Therefore, in order to remain a citizen, I am *forced* by the government's rules to use USD.  Nothing more, nothing less.  You are grossly misunderstanding our entire discussion (which hints at a reading comprehension problem) when you interpret that to mean that I think somehow someone owes me something.  I am capable of feeding myself, I just have to use USD to do it.


You are so off base that I don't even know what you are talking about anymore.  I've added the caveat that *if I want to remain a citizen* the US is forcing me to use their currency.  How many times do you want to beat that dead horse?  It's still effectively force.  Once I've accrued the tax burden that the government says I owe, they'll use *force* to make me use USD to repay it.


Didn't say they did, just that if I want one, I have to use USD.  I'm talking about the TOOLS and you're talking about ENTITLEMENT.  There are two very different ideas at play here and you are arguing an argument that isn't present.

You don't, nor should you.  I'm pointing out simply that in order to continue existing, **I** must acquire sustenance.  All forms of acquiring sustenance require, at some point, the use of fiat.


Again, I clarified to say that the use of USD was forced on *citizens*. 
You started with this statement:


That's objectively false.  The libertarian ideology is that the use of force by the government is *bad* in *most* situations.  A central bank is one of those situation for most; *not* because of *bureaucracy* but because of the effective force.
The term force here implies that *force* is only being used on *citizens*.  This whole *Well then GTFO if you don't like it* is bullshit, because people are allowed to dislike some parts about the country and like other parts, without having to *GTFO*.
You're being intentionally obtuse for reasons I don't quite understand.

Libertarians are fine with huge bureaucratically organized companies, as long as they aren't *forced* to participate.  The central bank doesn't really ask whether you want to be part of their schemes; they print money and it devalues yours, whether you like it or not.  And since you *need* that same money to pay taxes, you don't have a choice.
In this situation you have a choice.  Users are mad because they placed trust and were burned; it's natural to get angry when you get burned.  The "political bias" you speak of is people wanting robust places to exchange bitcoin for dollars.  That's also not really "political", but more of a consumer expectation.

You're right; you aren't the same individual that I replied to initially.  My mistake.  Here was the [*original* statement]( that spawned this discussion:


Does that provide some clarity as to my motive for beginning this conversation, and give you an idea of the direction I came from?


No it's not a crime, because the IRS just refuses anything *but*.  They *do* require you to pay taxes, through the use of force.  And they require taxes on every transaction.  So they require the use USD through force once a transaction has been transacted.  I feel like we've made this clear through our discussion.  Must we hash it over once more?


Who suggested you don't pay taxes?  I *do* believe that alternative forms of recognized currency should be accepted in lieu of USD (because Muh Freedoms), but that's not really the discussion here.  You seem to want to make it that, and I do have my opinions, but the truth here is that I am *simply* and *only* pointing out (from a discussion you jumped into in the middle) that the issue with central banks is one of force, not one of bureaucracy.

Usually encryption files have header packets that describe what type of file it is, but that's not *necessary*.  If you encrypt a file on your hard drive then you've still got a "file" that has a beginning and end as told to your operating system (THESE bytes belong to THIS file).  That is not something that is completely necessary.  I could encrypt data and add it to the end of a video file, for instance, and it would just look like static if you played it.  Or I could use the least significant bit of every byte in a JPEG and hide encrypted data there.

So when someone wants something, they're entitled.  But when they want to do it themselves, then they are entitled.  You just want people to shut the fuck up, sit the fuck down and take their medicine.  That's fucking stupid.


Ok, then, so how do we go about changing those rules?  Am I not part of society?  Do my opinions not deserve a voice?


But it doesn't *have* to be.  It is not *essential* for you to use the land's currency except the government says so.  Our government is *of the people, by the people, for the people*.  If we decide, we could remove that requirement.  And my point wasn't that we should (although I think we should, but that's a different discussion), only that central banks are a problem for libertarians in a way that bitcoin exchanges are *not*.  The comparison is wrong because central banks have a level of coercion that bitcoin exchanges *do not*.


Yea, which is why I was surprised and a little vexed that you would argue so vehemently against it.  Your pedantry is strong.  My entire point was the central banks have a number of *essential life functions* wrapped up in their operation (including food, shelter, clothing, even moving expenses to leave the country).  This is not true for bitcoin exchanges, and thus the analogy doesn't fit.  QE fucking D.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:51:42


I'll clarify; it's forced upon *citizens*.  


False; I require sustenance.  If I reject your first premise (I choose to stay here), I have to eat, so I either purchase (requires money), barter (IRS has rules about barter as it applies to income, and therefore would be taxed on income) or grow food (which requires land, which means I have to pay taxes).  So unless I choose option one, I'm being forced by the government to use fiat.

Yes, that is true except you have to "prefund" the tab.  It's kind of like gas stations that push an initial charge of $100 to your credit card until the actual transaction can be pushed through, at which time the $100 charge is dropped.
It's more accurately like buying chips at a casino, going and using those chips at all the different games, and then at the end of the night settling up at the chip kiosk.  In this analogy bitcoin is the USD and lightning network payment channels exchange the chips back and forth.  You have to come to the table with a certain quantity of money and lock it up in the channel if you want to spend it.  If you only plan to have payments sent to you (like a video streaming service, for instance) you don't need to lock up any funds.  I've heard, however, of channel hubs or something that can add funding to an open channel but I'm a little unclear on how that works.

Once you get on, utility is similar to now.  Yes, less people would accept it, but those that do accept it would still enjoy the same utility (10 minute confirmations, cryptographic security, etc).  I'd agree though that there'd be downward pressure on price due to legitimate usage being curtailed.

Yes, because corporations pay individuals, who are taxed.  Compensation has to account for those taxes.
If you tax corporations directly, they'll either raise prices on their goods or not be able to pay people as much.


I see this criticism all the time.  If CEOs are getting paid an unfair amount, why aren't more people becoming CEOs?  Is it because of some kind of high barrier to entry or is there something else there?  Becoming a CEO requires a level of aggression most people don't have.  It requires negotiating skills most people don't have.  It requires dedication to the job that most people don't have.  If companies could afford to pay them less why don't they?

Alright, this is the last response because it's evident where we both stand;


Sure, if those are the only two options.  But one third option is that another coin comes along that allows you to buy groceries today and *still* can be sound money for decades to come, then there's a risk there.  There are other scenarios that play out where bitcoin loses market share because it didn't move quickly enough.




Again, you only provide two possible scenarios, when others are possible.  This is referred to as a "false dichotomy".  One third option is that they have prioritized other things above the fee size because they're inundated with newcomers and don't have the manpower to build out segwit at the moment.

If you reset it and didn't back up the key you're boned.

It is in fact, different than withdrawing cash at the moment because the network for cash is *enormous* (basically everyone) whereas the network for LN is incredibly tiny right now (as in, no one).  As the LN network increases, this becomes less of an issue, but bootstrapping the network is difficult while this limitation is in place.  


This is the problem though; if I anticipate usage, I lock them up (with an on-chain transaction = currently a high fee).  Then, if I need to use them without lightning, I have to unlock them (with an on-chain transaction = currently a high fee).  So I'd have locked/unlocked them to use them.  Depending on how much I used the LN in the interim, this could be a major cost.


Then there's low to no incentive to run a node.  And if you can route through a cheaper node, then we already have a decent network in place (which hasn't occured yet).


How do you determine the likelihood of this event?  More likely will be only a few ways to any individual person and most ways will go through large central hubs that may or may not require KYC to interact with.

Alice wants to transact with Bob.  Alice finds a route to Bob through SuperHub, who is connected to HubExchange, who is connected to Bob.  Because SuperHub is connected to HubExchange, they have already provided KYC to HubExchange as HubExchange is a legitimate exchange who follows the regulation of money transmitters.  If SuperHub relays (or creates) any payment over $10k, they now have to fill out a Form 8300.  This makes SuperHub unlikely to relay transactions to HubExchange unless they have *also* done KYC on Alice.  So in order for Alice to get to Bob, she must have submitted her info to SuperHub.
I'm positing that there is a real chance that LN creates centralizing pressure and those centralized nodes will be compliant.

So because people followed the developer team we should respect them more?  Circular argument.  Also, many people are concerned with the *adoption* of bitcoin, which fees are hindering.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:42:34


And if you opt out you have to deal with the fees that LN is supposed to save us from.


But the problem is, you can't definitively discount the possibility but many like you are still touting LN as the end-all-be-all and using it to claim that a block size increase is pointless.


Which currently, is expensive to use.


This caveat is unnecessary as I am discussing the benefits of LN vs the relatively easy mechanism for easing fee costs which would be a blocksize increase and not simply bitching and moaning that bitcoin isn't doing exactly what I want.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:37:42
And originally I asked how you could make that inference since it's not being widely utilized now.   Obviously,  assuming regular growth,  segwit will eventually not be enough,  but if most people were using it now,  would it ease the constraint enough to enjoy cheap transactions until LN can be deployed and begin to work its own magic?
Edit: autocorrect

That's not what I said.  I'm stipulating that other solutions may still be necessary and that LN may not provide the relief people claims it does.

I'd agree.  SW2X would not have been a "disaster" if it hadn't been resisted on such a slim premise.  I'd also be in for a more "official" hard fork that introduces other hard fork wishlist items as well.  B

Currently, without scaling solutions, I agree.


A good way to remember whether you need the apostrophe or not is to think about whether you're using the term to show possession or to contract "it is".  When showing possession, think of his/hers.  No apostrophe.  So here, you are saying "it is acceptance in major stores is dropping".  No apostrophe there.  
Again, without scaling, this is true.


Could be more if people used segwit.  Everyone crying about fee size and transaction throughput who aren't using segwit are just using whatever statistics they can to smear bitcoin. 
USE SEGWIT AND FEES ARE LOWER AND THE NETWORK CAN ACCOMMODATE MORE TRANSACTIONS.


It's absolutely *not* failing, as the price shows.  Acceptance as a real asset is increasing.  There are some technical hurdles to overcome, but my god man the price is over $10k a coin and there are FUTURES for this fucking thing.  You can't honestly say it's failing, even if your gripes are currently valid.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:04:40
The thing I think is not being considered is the cost of locking up funds for LN transactions.  Running a LN node means leaving coin locked up.  Again, as the network grows this cost is less, but starting out LN is going to have a hard time because most people won't be using it and you'll have to choose between running an LN node and actually using your coin.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:34:58
Coinbase requires KYC for payments *they process*.  Forwarding them using Coinbase's locked coins *is* different than the node operators they connect to because as a bitcoin node, you aren't using *your own funds* to process transactions.
Apples and Oranges my friend.
Coinbase *already* watches your funds for more than a single hop *after you've withdrawn your money*.  To think they won't have the same level of scrutiny on LN funds is ignorant.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:48:40


But as has been said before, there *will* eventually need to be a hard fork to increase the block size, even with LN (assuming Visa level transaction throughput).  There are also other "wishlist" items that a hard fork could introduce.  This is not *reactionary*, it is *proactive*.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:44:03
But you have to have the currency now in anticipation of future use and you have to tie it up with the channel until you are ready to cash out.  You also have to be able to find a routing to the user you are trying to transact with (which should become increasingly easy as adoption picks up, but will probably be a pretty big challenge at first).  Also, there are fees associated with each hop, correct?  Do we have any metrics on what those fees might be?

So because people aren't using it,  the benefits are small,  so instead of more people using it to increase the benefit we need something different?  That's a weird argument to make. 
The benefit is not just more space on a block but less fee per byte (segwit space is discounted iirc).

It's businesses that aren't miners I'm referring to.


Lightning network is not something the miners control.  It is a protocol for doing *off-chain* transactions that are *settled* on-chain.  The miners have literally no say in whether or not its used.  However, I was referring to segwit, not LN.




Again, I was referring to segwit.  And businesses could use it right now, but aren't.  Anyone bitching about fees who is not using segwit is being disingenuous.

Most, but not all.  The miners have to process their own blocks, and the faster they are processed the less likely they are to be orphaned, so it's in a miner's best interest to keep the block size small enough to be quickly processed and included.


Miners have to run full nodes...  Exchanges run full nodes.  Most merchants run full nodes.
Either way, miners won't release blocks too big for the network to handle; that's not economically viable either.  They lose ROI on their hardware if they cripple the network.

Because it's *not their money*.  They are not complicit in that transaction being included in the network because it does not route through their capital.  Also, they get don't get paid for this because they aren't actually participating in the transaction.


You understand that in the first scenario, they are not an intermediary but just a broadcaster while in the second scenario they literally have to use their own money to forward the transaction, right?  Also, in the first scenario, *they don't get paid* because they aren't participating in that transaction while in the second scenario *they are getting paid* because they are *part of the transaction*.


But they are an active participant in the LN case.  This is the point you keep glossing over.  They have to actively dedicate funds to perform this process *and they get paid for it*.  


network transactions are occurring with or without you; relaying is not participating.  It's not the same thing.


Again, that is false.  They can require KYC *to open channels*.  And then if they are suspicious of any activity they'll just refuse to process payments from that channel.  It doesn't have to be technically possible for every transaction to be effectively possible in a broad manner similar to how banks handle cash transactions.  Obviously banks can't determine definitively the origin of all cash but they can still make it difficult to route cash to other locations without knowing the origin of the funds.
Look, I'm not against LN; I'm excited about new tech like this.  It will help the network ease congestion, but I believe it will be less helpful than is being touted and may provide some centralizing pressure.
It's also not going to alleviate the need for additional block space.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:05:30


This is pedantic; you are telling people to "educate themselves".  Well I have a more than basic understanding of how lightning network intends to operate and I am *also* concerned about larger nodes being the norm (and potentially enforcing KYC/AML against those who use their nodes).  


In this analogy, you are claiming that this scenario is *impossible* but you still have not presented an argument as to why this concern is so baseless.


There, again, you claim that he is so uninformed that there's no way his scenario can possibly play out.  Well, I'm *not* uninformed and I share his sentiment.  So please, inform *me* why more highly connected nodes aren't more valuable, why this valuation won't provide a centralizing pressure on nodes and why it's impossible that the scenario in which companies like Coinbase becoming essential hubs for feasible routing paths could not play out, or if it could play out, how those essential hubs won't be able to exercise their central position in a matter beneficial to them?

Absolutely.  That makes complete sense.

Ok, so then all payments would be the responsibility of the forwarder.
Just like running a tor exit node, you're responsible for all traffic that comes through, regardless of whether or not it originates with you.
So Coinbase will do KYC on all LN nodes coming in (which they can verify before they accept the node connection) and then require that anyone who wishes to create an LN node for forwarding transactions do KYC on all their nodes.
Obviously this is not enforceable at the protocol level, but it's not with cash either, yet somehow they do it.

The idea that miners will continue to operate on the first seen transaction methodology is naïve IMO.  Over time, they will seek to maximize their profits, and choosing a transaction with a higher fee to include in their block makes sense financially. 
I don't see how RBF makes this more likely.
Edit: Also; until the internet, checks were used with a large degree of success without any way to prevent double-spends.

@_date: 2015-12-30 18:37:51


Right, but the definition of "hard fork" vs "soft fork" is a "soft fork" is a change in the definition of "valid block" that clients prior to the fork still also recognize as valid, while a "hard fork" is a change in the definition of "valid block" such that clients to the fork no longer recognize the new definition as valid.  Basically, a soft fork is "more restrictive" and a hard fork is "less restrictive".  It may not work exactly that way all the time, but it's a simple way to keep it straight.  Thus, a bigger maximum is a *hard fork*.


And how does the network "not like it"?  You must somehow mark that block as "not valid".  The blockchain is the longest chain of valid blocks.  If you want a valid block on the longest chain to be ignored, you have to *invalidate it*.  This is a *hard fork*, because older clients will see it as valid, while new clients won't.
The network isn't a group of people making arbitrary decisions, it's software validating blocks using client code.  If the majority of the network changes the client code, we refer to that as a "fork".

Of course the ecosystem is worth considering.  I'm just saying, miners control the protocol.  That's kind of how the whole thing is set up.  You could argue that exchanges *really* control the protocol, because if they refuse to follow a fork, the fork won't have much *value* and the miners on it will not realize very much profit, and I'd agree with that.  But at the base level, the miners control how the blockchain is constructed.  That was my point.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:29:37
A few points:


This is *not* backing.  You've severely misunderstood the concept of *backing* if you believe this to be the case.  Backing is not important because the medium of exchange needs to have its own money.  Backing is an antiquated attempt to strip the issuer of the ability to issue funds at their discretion.  This is in response to several historical cases of money debasement; a form of theft from the populous by the government.
The backing must be valuable because otherwise the government could fabricate *the backing* and thus indirectly inflate.
Backing is not about having value, but about preventing institutionalized theft, which has historically terrible repercussions.


Only because the bank has purchased insurance from the government and additionally swallows enormous sums of fraud on an annual basis.  


Bad example; GM literally bought up trolley cars in the '40s to sell more cars.  That shit does happen.  However, I'd agree that there's a mountain of anti-establishment sentiment in this sub that is unsubstantiated.


Kind of like how Ripple is successful, Quorum is huge, Bank of America just got patents for some kind of block-chain based exchange platform?  Like that?


So is Bitcoin doomed because it can't completely replace everything tomorrow?  Maybe giving it some room to mature and grow ancillary technologies to improve these problems would be prudent.
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:33:45
But if major exchanges don't, miners will end up with coins they can't turn in to fiat to cover operating expenses.  Major exchanges control the market, and the market incentivizes the security.

He meant "economically viable for the infrastructure to continue processing those payments".


No they can't; if the transaction rate gets too high, miners won't pick up "free" transactions and you'll need higher and higher fees to transact.  Thus, the coffee buyer will be priced out, and it will no longer be "on-chain for free".

I'd say you have to see it as a spectrum, yes.  A sliding scale where Settlement is on one side and Payment is on the other.  We can't have it all the way to either side.

Artificial does not imply not reliable.  That's pretty silly, no?  I mean, other artificial things are reliable; artificial limbs, for instance, can be pretty reliable.


Not true; the full nodes are stopping them.  And other miners, and everyone who isn't willing to disrupt their gravy train.


Gold isn't valuable simply because it is scarce, it's valuable because of its intrinsic properties, which create demand for it.  Without scarcity it would be cheap, yes, but there are other scarce materials out there that no one wants.  My shit, for instance, is pretty scarce on earth.  But no one wants it because it doesn't have any inherent properties that create demand for it.  Value comes from demand for intrinsic properties + scarcity.  You need both.


False.  Money requires scarcity for it to hold value.  Without scarcity, everyone could have as much as they want; it wouldn't reliably transfer value.  See above; for something to have value it requires demand and scarcity.  For instance, there's demand for oxygen, but not a lot of scarcity.  Therefore most people don't pay for air, even though they absolutely must have it to live.
You need both, or value isn't generated.

One of the problems with blacklisting coins is that Bitcoin is a PUSH mechanism, instead of a PULL mechanism.  That means that you have to initiate the transfer OUT, and there's no provision for choosing to accept or reject a transfer IN.  So, all a "blacklisted" user has to do is send a small amount of the blacklisted coins to well known active addresses (which can be found easily with blockchain analysis), and boom, all of a sudden all kinds of legitimate coins are now blacklisted too.
So it becomes very difficult to differentiate when a user has a combination of different blacklisted coins (with taints that are very low) that they themselves were blacklisted and mixed the coins or were just unlucky.

Snark for snark, fair enough, but everything I said *was* econ 101.  Just because there are mitigating factors *sometimes*, in *some* situations, doesn't mean that the basic ideas don't underpin the majority of markets worldwide.


Thanks for clarifying exactly what I meant by "Generally".  This is *precisely* what I said.  In most situations, if demand stays the same and supply increases, price drops.  Of course it's not *necessarily true*, but it's *usually* true.  Your clarification does not negate my statement.


And you'd probably not provide any evidence to the contrary if you were *just* being snarky and didn't have any evidence to back up your claims.
If people hold a commodity in spite of demand for them to sell, then they either A) can't sell, which reduces supply, or B) believe the price will go higher, which provides support for the current price and makes it harder for prices to fall.
*In general*, those who take long positions support a higher price.  This is not complicated.

What's the motive for holding?  Either A) you have a use for them (demand) or B) you believe they'll go higher.
Taking a long position supports a higher price because your only other option is to sell, which supports a lower price.


No, I'm arguing they sell coins to cover operating costs.  I'm not even sure why this is relevant though; I've lost track with all your convolutions.  


Which you countered, and I accepted.  Hence, we were even.  You continued to be a dickhead, so now you're up in the dickhead tally.


Oooh, plus 1 for you.


I'd say the same for you.
I've thought about it another way for you.  When a holder *enters* his position, he must be a marginal buyer, unless he's a miner, in which case he's still "kind of" a buyer, with the network being the seller and electricity being the currency - this works too; more people demanding a fixed supply = more and more electricity/innovation taking place to obtain the same reward.  The only way to obtain bitcoin is to *create demand* for it.  If you are a buyer and then subsequently never a seller, you've propped up the price just by having bought it.  Until you sell, that purchase adds *upward pressure* on the price because it inarguably already added pressure once as a marginal buyer, and not removed it by becoming a marginal seller.

I understand.  I was trying to provide perspective.  Even though mine are about 7x stronger than yours, I'm still only finding a qualifying nonce about every 2 or 3 hours with three.  Simple extrapolation would estimate one very 6-9 hours for a 2.3gh/s miner.  Further simple extrapolation would put one qualifying nonce at every 42-63 hours for one of your block erupters.
My client estimates that I make 160nBTC/hr.  Three 330mh/s miners would make (again, simple extrapolation) about 22 satoshis an hour.  For $.11/kWh, 15 watts costs about 4.5 cents a day to run.

@_date: 2016-01-27 18:30:55


Me too!  Just kidding, but you don't know, and neither do I.


Right, sure, no *direct* impact.  I agree.


But everyone doesn't buy immediately.  So if everyone thought stocks would go up, those who *had* the stocks would start demanding more to release them.  Eventually there would be no marginal buyers, which would cause the price to top out.


Except that not everyone can own a stock by the nature of stocks being finite, so that person who wants to sell can offer for sale to someone else who previously wasn't able to get a position.  Your example is meaningless because it assumes that demand is satiated if people aren't buying *at the current price*.  That's a false assumption, because demand could exist at a lower price point.  Hence, if you are holding, you believe A) the price is accurate and you don't want to part with your position, or B) the price will go higher.  


But the only way for this to happen is for people to start *offering to sell*.  Only when people start competing to sell (assuming demand isn't there) will the price drop.  If no one is willing to sell, and there is *any* demand, then price will either stay the same as those who wish to buy coins wait for their price point, or buyers will up their bid.


Again, only when people are *willing* to buy will this trend shift.  So once people begin to demand *holding*, the price will shift back upwards.

That's not true.  Basic economic can be seen, for instance, during any holiday rush, where certain prize toys soar in value and then collapse after the season is over.


Anecdotal evidence is worthless.


You mean "lots of how stuff works in a vacuum but doesn't take into account other factors" outlines, which I'd agree with, and why I hedged with "Generally" in my original statement.


Since most miners convert immediately to cover their operating costs, I'd say you are wrong.  That's why we see difficulty levels affected by price swings; miners need cash inflow to pay for electricity, which implies they have to offload those coins once they get them.


Strictly, bitcoin is inelastic since difficulty manages the release of coins, and the supply is capped.  Regardless of the price, bitcoin's supply remains the same.  However, I'd say there was a large amount of elasticity in the supply of bitcoin *for sale*.  When the price moves up, more people are willing to sell their bitcoin.


Yes, which is why I brought it up...

Why is that a fear?  Most capitalistic endeavors end up with a few highly efficient market players, only being torn down when innovation disrupts their business model or corruption eats them from the inside or massive consumer trust issues arise.
This is literally how just about every other free market on earth works.
The cool thing is that you *never* actually have to use LN if you choose not to.  Just like with the banks today in meatspace, if you want to use cash, you can completely bypass the banks.  Otherwise, you're probably doing business with one of a few highly efficient banks (let's not talk about the inefficiencies of today's banks, which I'd argue are caused in large part because of "too-big-to-fail" mentalities and regulatory capture).

Mtgox *definitely* was the underlying cause of the last bubble.  Were you there?  The biggest exchange (which, for many set the price of bitcoin) made it difficult to get money out.  Bitcoin was the frictionless option which set a major premium on their price.  Couple that with fake trading (aka Willybot) and you have the ingredients to fuel a massive bubble.
There *has* also been a massive change in the bitcoin ecosystem.  New exchanges have exploded, adding liquidity like crazy.  No single exchange has the same power anymore.
Not saying bubbles aren't gonna happen anymore but greed and fear have a harder time swaying the market than before.

They are.  I never asserted that credit cards aren't a good way to pay bills.  


But they *do* enjoy the fact that in an hour they've discovered whether there was fraudulent activity or not, and there are also measures (like with Mycelium) that can predict the probability of a double spend attempt based on network propagation.  Then, when you factor in the potential that the new Lightning Network proposals bring, you bring that risk down even further.


But if they could get a higher volume with bitcoin, they'd pay less fees and not wait 90 days for their money.  So basically your argument boils down to "There's not enough volume".  Ok, for in person POS sales, *currently*, I'd agree.  But Bitcoin's use cases are far more desirable with, say, electronic purchases where delivery of goods is expected, or where international remittance is required.


Except it's not; you need to wait 90 days for the same payment assurance Bitcoin offers in 1 hour.

I have *evidence* that miners do not hold, because price very strongly affects difficulty level.  If miners held, this would not be the case as such.  But to further satisfy you, here's a quote from an [analysis of large scale bitcoin mining operations](


Now, unless you can provide sources to show that miners are *exclusively* rich bitcoin enthusiasts, a reasonable person can assume they have to sell *some* of their coins to cover operating costs.  Do you really need a source to show that miners are selling coins to cover operating costs?


Miners aren't the holders.  Both can co-exist.

It *is* a necessary condition of the argument.  Mining costs money, lots of it.  We approximate the quantity using difficulty levels.  Unless you have funding separate from the coins (aka rich), you can't afford *not* to cash out coins.  And if you have the funding, the only reason for mining without cashing out is because you are an enthusiast.


Learn to not be dickhead.


Except you are not proving that the downward trend would *not* have been greater had other holders sold.

Which is the current system, which allows bitcoin to supplant it while retaining the choice to transact directly on-chain or to open up your own channels if you don't agree with Bank-Node A's or Bank-Node D's policies.


If all they can do is close the channel, that doesn't sound like "At the mercy of their exchange" to me.

Like providing safety from the weather and a way to secure your other assets?  Bitcoin does this too by providing safety from theft and a way to facilitate digital trade.


Also not strictly true; many countries hold USD in reserve.  It's interesting aspects are the trust in its value.


I would argue that the quantity of reserves held in gold belie this point.


But usage is *increasing* over time.  Also, it makes sense for usage to be lower when cost of entry is high (either directly through costs or indirectly through learning curves).


This phenomenon is seen in lots of new technologies that have a large potential; look at the dot com bubble.  Many people bought in for the exact same reasons, but look at the internet now.

You seem to be under the impression that large companies can just go in and upgrade software with no cost.  That's not true.  It takes large teams significant time to upgrade software for large companies (which includes development and QA before deployment), and hardware changes usually must accompany that, especially for larger vendors.
Additionally, it's increasingly not a hardware issue as most hardware that's network enabled can support both ipv4 and ipv6.  Even though most places are equipped for ipv6, they STILL aren't switching.
It's definitely comparable, even if some of the underlying technologies are different.

In bitcoin's situation users are not specifically choosing a miner.  The miner picks up whatever transactions exist.

This is in stark contrast to the existing banking infrastructure where I have to have an existing relationship to perform any transactions.

Well, first of all there *are* numbers that show that the block size itself can be increased.  


Yes, I'll agree with that.  However, I'd also state that just creating a transaction increases the cost of running nodes.  I'd also want to inject here that the larger blocks are only larger *if blocks are full*.  If blocks are full then we are seeing increased usage.  Increased usage means more nodes.




All else being equal, sure.  But the problem is if you choose the method that makes *transactions* more expensive, you decrease usage or encourage usage of third parties, which creates a *centralizing pressure*.  You can't make these statements in a vacuum.


Correct, but the transmit/receive *was* a major concern for propagation of blocks which was believed to increase geographical centralization and thus centralize mining in only a few places.  With propagation less of an issue, we don't need to be as concerned that miners will stay near each other.

Price is a function of value.  In general, there are two ways to obtain a good or service.  The first way is to do it yourself.  That way requires time and potentially money (electrical costs).  The second way is to pay someone else to do it.  The *price* is the amount people are willing to pay others to do it for them.
So the *blocks* have value.  How do you pay people to put the *blocks* together in a chain?  That's the *fee*, which is collected in *bitcoin* (the tokens).  So the miners are getting paid in *tokens*, which must have a value to the miners equal or greater to the time and money it takes to generate the blocks (or else they wouldn't do it).  Then, how do you obtain more tokens for insertion into the blocks?  Bitcoin has a fixed supply.  Currently coins can either be issued by mining (in exchange for time/money) or obtained from others.  The others who have the tokens, should they give them to you, either paid for those tokens or mined them (which took time/money).  Giving them up means they lose the good they spend time/money to obtain, so they require compensation.  The people who have tokens who bought them (to use as time-stampers) have created a price by buying them.  They won't give them up freely; they paid something for them.
So the point that I'm making is that you can't say the tokens have no value if you say they have value.  The tokens, should they have value and not be infinite in quantity, will automatically generate a price by the fact that people want them for their value.
You can't have a thought experiment where something of value has no price, because if something has value and it can not be freely obtained (like air), the only thing you need is one person offering to trade money for that something's use.
Establishing something has value and scarcity automatically implies it has a price.

I never understood this euphemism.  I can *definitely* compare apples to oranges.  They are both fruit, they both grow on trees.  They both have skin and flesh and seeds.  Apples' flesh are firmer with less citric acid while Oranges' flesh are mushier with some white skaffolding holding it together.  Oranges' skin are not as palatable as Apples.  Apples do better in colder climates.  
I compare apples to oranges all the time when I am going to eat a fruit.  When someone is going to buy a commodity to store value, they'll *definitely* compare bitcoin to gold and silver, as well as stocks and bonds and real estate and all the other non-fiat stores of value that exist.

A point I think you've neglected is the cost of storage of btc vs gold.  Bitcoin has a set cost for storage (cold store computer, paper wallet(s), what have you) and once you pay that you can store as much bitcoin as you can get your hands on in the same place for the same cost.  Gold, however, requires larger and larger storage facilities as you increase your holdings.  You can pay someone else to secure it, but then you don't *really* control it and you have a real cost with holding.

My first impression is to combat the idea that big blocks hurt full nodes. 
"Well, full nodes aren't necessary anyway".
However, I believe other avenues of debate exist; the current blocksize won't even accommodate widespread LN usage in the near future, and accommodating increased usage makes the network more useful, which encourages economic participation and incentivizes more people to use full nodes for increased economic activity.
The threshold for the maximum/average blocksize exists.  No one is 100% sure what that threshold is, but most believe that 1mb is not it (hence segwit giving us a 1.7x increase without contention, except maybe LukeJr).  Bitcoin Cash is demonstrating that 8mb is plausible, although I haven't seen any numbers on node counts or node resource utilization, and I don't believe most of their blocks are even close to the max size, so it doesn't seem to be an issue ATM.
TLDR; full nodes are hurt most by increased block sizes.  Denigrating full node operation appears to be an attempt to diffuse this argument.

So 4/9,000,000,000,000 is an incredibly low fatality rate.  It's the law of diminishing returns.  We could spend a LOT of money having children personally escorted by secret service to school, and probably reduce that to 0 fatalities.  Should we?

I'm saying LN is more like debit and on-chain transactions are more like cash.  I think the analogy by OP is backwards.


I am not mandated to open a channel with anyone.  Large scale hubs *will* eventually comply with local regulation.  And businesses *will* seek to partner only with regulated hubs.  It will become very difficult to find a path to a legitimate business without  at some point going through KYC/AML.
LN hubs will necessarily gravitate towards a bank-like structure because being connected is valuable, and governments look for hubs of financial activity to monitor for illegal behavior.  Governments will not allow these LN hubs (over a certain size) to open channels with unknown participants, much like exchanges won't accept deposits from unknown participants.

Yea, the quadratic hashing problem is an issue that is solved by BIP143 which is part of segwit.  This is one of the reasons I'm pro segwit.


No, that's true.  But we're speaking in physical analogies that break down past a certain point.  Making room *and* providing more space will *both* be necessary.  We're already providing the "fiber" by FIBRE and XTHIN blocks (which reduce propagation).  Adding segwit (and thereafter Schnorr signatures) helps improve the processing part as it reduces the signature requirements.
Look at it this way; you are theorizing that nodes will get knocked off the network due to the increased expense.  However, if we assume (as we should) that higher expense means less participation, wouldn't we expect the same thing to happen with the blockchain?  Sure, LN provides some relief due to off-chain transactions being traded back and forth but that channel needs to be *settled*.  There will come a time, assuming consistently increasing adoption, where even that settlement will become expensive.


I will choose the segwit2x fork when it happens.  However, there's a lot of talk about not following the 2x fork since the segwit1x folk got what they wanted.  I'm concerned that it won't happen and then I'll have to pick one *or* the other.
And no, I won't just go to an alt.  They don't have widespread adoption or network effect and are therefore inferior choices.

It is difficult for me to understand how Lightning is going to have widespread support.  I have to *lock* my bitcoin with another person to utilize LN.  In order for LN to be useful, this other person has to have connections to *a lot* of people.  So effectively I'll be locking my bitcoin with a central agency that maintains channels to a large number of people.  This central agency will be able to prevent transactions of mine if they wish and will basically act like a bank except without the ability to seize funds.  
I just don't understand how this is going to have widespread usage.  I can see lots of niche uses, like streaming content, gambling, etc but I don't see it useful for, say, a transaction with Newegg.  I don't want to lock my funds with anyone for a long period of time.  The only way this becomes beneficial is if fees are very high.

No, it's not incorrect.  You have to *lock* funds in a channel to be able to leverage LN to reduce the cost of microtransactions.


It facilitates microtransactions but to be effective you have to have *multiple* transactions between the *same party*.  You need to open a channel and lock funds in it.  Only then can microtransactions flow back and forth.  This means that microtransactions are only facilitated if you are doing many of them with the same actor or connected actor, and you have to lock funds with said actor until all transactions are complete.  Unlocking those funds requires an on-chain transaction (a second one, the first of which opened the channel).  So you need to be relatively certain that you can conduct more than 2 transactions with or through a second party before an LN channel is worthwhile.

Sure, but the point is that the consensus rules were not *originally* chosen with any empiricism because nothing had been tested.  New consensus rules don't have any empiricism until they have been *tested*.  The number of alts that exist already show that consensus rules for blockchains can be chosen arbitrarily and are therefore *subjective*.


Bitcoin consensus rules can be changed while still maintaining the name "bitcoin" because the consensus rules are not laws of nature but concepts chosen by bitcoin's creator and other consensus rules can serve as well and maybe better.

But if that's the case, then they obviously value the bitcoin *at least* the amount of the electricity that it would cost to run it plus the time associated with setting up and maintaining it.  Some people would rather just buy the tokens from someone else (because specialization is a thing), and then you have value.
If a good isn't 100% completely easy and free to obtain, and there is demand for it (in any capacity), then it will always have *some* value to *someone*.  If no one wanted it, it couldn't even be used as a time-stamper because no one would want to mine it.  As soon as someone wanted it for a time-stamper, then someone would want it for *something*, and thus you've created value.
So I guess I'm trying to say is that it's paradoxical to say something has a use and no value.  You can't even perform the thought experiment because "use" of an object is a subset of its "value".  If its use in trade is zero, it's "value" set is the "use" set.  
[Here's an illustration]( if it helps.  The black circle with white fill is an item's value.  The red circle is an item's use.  If the value is solely in the use, then the red circle would completely fill the value circle.  So as long as there is a red circle (use) of larger than zero radius, then the black circle with white fill (value) will be *at least* that big.
So I guess, in the end, we're in agreement.  As long as it has use, it has value.

Neither paper took FIBRE or XTHIN Blocks into account (which mitigate the major propagation issues with larger blocks).
Neither paper took into account increasing bandwidth.  Neither paper took into account any potential increase in processing power.  Neither paper accounted for an increase of business presence in the space (those who are incentivized by their business to run nodes and with the capacity to do so even at much larger scale).
We're still *super* light on the evidence to support centralization as an inevitable consequence of larger blocks but some people have already taken it as gospel.

Except with cash I don't have to lock money in to transact.  When I go to WalMart, I just give them some sum and walk away, there's no "locking" with transactions back and forth.  It's more like a "debit" approach.  I have to "deposit" some funds into my channel with a company either to transact.  This hub then can transact back and forth on my behalf.  Hubs with higher connection counts are more convenient/valuable because I can do more business through them and thus lock a larger amount of bitcoin with them.
On chain transactions are cash.  They require no middle man and can be done without permission.  LN transactions *may* refuse to open a channel with addresses that they don't recognize, and *may* require KYC/AML before a user's address can be recognized.

I wasn't the OP of the analogy.


The settlements are traceable.  Yea, there's a divergence here but you still have to *open a channel with a single intermediary* to transact with.  I feel like I'm repeating myself here.


But LN hubs *charge fees*, so they just have to charge what it costs them to run.
Do we strive to make mining as cheaply as possible for decentralization purposes?  No?  Same idea.


I'm not sure how this is relevant.


Yep, agreed.


If they aren't extremely expensive.  This is the point where people say "yea, we need to ensure that LN is never the only affordable method, so we should expand the on-chain space as a relief valve".
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:24:12
Yes, I see the potential for scaling, but I also see centralization pressure as LN nodes need to be hyper connected to be useful.  Additionally, if on-chain transactions are too expensive, LN will be the *only* way for many people to transact and they may not even be able to open a *single* channel for the cost, which would mean they'd need to go through large businesses with a bank-like feel.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:59:34
I understand the routing concept, but here's the concern I have.  I'm operating on two assumptions:
1. Lightning Network is useful
2. Bitcoin adoption will continue to increase
3. A point will occur where the chain is consistently saturated with organic use.
To address the first point, I'm very excited about the new use cases that Lightning Network brings to the table.  However, with the second point being a reasonable assumption, we will see the chain saturated with legitimate use (meaning organic use of users attempting to transfer funds, and not spammy transactions designed to flood the network) in the future.  This naturally develops a fee market for on-chain transactions.  If the third point also comes to pass, then those fees will rise as adoption increases.
There will come a point where on-chain transactions are so expensive, that people will not be able to even *open* a LN channel with someone else.  Now, as you propose, once they open a channel they can basically transact with anyone on the network.  But how do they even get *on* the LN network?  
This seems far off, and it probably is.  However, I fully understand the desire to push for changes to mitigate these problems during upgrades.  Additionally, it is more than sensible that miners would see this as a potential threat to their increasingly important fee structure.  If the LN network gains adoption before the chain is saturated, it can create a stalling effect on the creation of a viable fee market as people forego on-chain transactions for the majority of their economic activity.
The final concern is that as LN channels become more expensive to open/close and as hubs grow in size, large nodes will be required in their jurisdiction to perform KYC/AML on their channel counterparties, creating a situation very similar to existing banks except without risk of asset seizure.  While removing asset seizure from banks is a laudable goal, one other valid and popular reason to avoid banks is AML/KYC type laws.
A lot of the points on both sides assumes a lot, I understand, but it still *makes sense* to simultaneously increase the on chain space so that on-chain transactions remain cheap and these concerns are mitigated.

No they don't.  They may question their use as *mediums of exchange* but if you are going to hang your argument on the idea that gold is worthless then I think you have some basic economics to understand first. 


Scamming someone is a human problem,  not a technical one.  Is email evil or worthless because people get scammed by it?   Are phones worthless because people use them to scam others?  Are you seriously contending that a technology had no worth because people are fallible?  How absurd. 


Alright,  new talking point. 
That's blatantly untrue.  VISA has a record of every purchase directly tied to your identity.  They have every merchant documented too.  In order to track you through bitcoin's network they have to devote lots of resources and even then addresses can be generated without an identity attached.  The privacy is fundamentally more robust with bitcoin than VISA.


Oh are we just going off the deep end are we?
The anonymity is lost before those papers are filled out and the approval is done behind closed doors where oversight is non existent.

Bandwidth costs are legitimate; but do you know what the difference is between the two different block sizes?  Have you looked into this more than a cursory pass through What percentage of bitcoin nodes are run by companies with vested interests?  How has that changed in the last few years?  How far does the current chain get to grow before the effects are similar?


What are the CPU requirement modifications?  Are we assuming completely full blocks all the time?  Do you have any numbers here?


Time to verify blocks is already being mitigated with technologies like FIBRE and XTHIN blocks.  


Other countries have mining too, and China won't maintain the majority forever.  Lots of countries have low energy costs, and places like Iceland also require less cooling.  


You mean *specialization*?  Yea, that's going to happen regardless. 


The constraint *is* artificial.  It is *explicitly* set in the code.  It would be organic if there was *no* limit and we just discovered that blocks above a certain size broke shit (not that I'm advocating that, just discerning between artificial and organic).

Upgrading TCP/IP is a good analogy.  Whatever happened to version 1, 2 and 3 before version 4 became widely adopted?  They "forked".  
Also, this difficulty in adoption is a very good reason WHY anyone who wants to hardfork would have a motivation to push for it as soon as possible; higher adoption means lower likelihood of capability to change.

Ya, "crazy" people.  ETF volume for the top two ETFs was over $15m yesterday.  GLD has over $32b in assets.  Fucking "crazy" people huh?  
Your argument now extends to *also* dismissing precious metals for anything other than crazy people and electronics.  Your reach is getting far.


The world 50 years ago used the gold standard, tis true.  And I recognize the benefit that a fiat currency provides a nation; I'm no stranger to current monetary policy and the abilities it grants to the government, and I believe they serve a valuable purpose.  Don't attempt to misconstrue my argument as "bitcoin is better than USD".  I'm not.


False equivelenacy.  Bitcoin is like an octagonal wheel in a world where *there are no wheels*.


Ya, and those are definitely in use for lots of purposes.  However, can you accept those prepaid cards without VISA?  No?  Ok, then you are still using *intermediaries*.


Are you being intentionally obtuse?


That's false.  If it was as you say, then why did it take 4 years to track down a suspect of the MtGox hack (which is a HUGE sum of money and therefore much easier and more lucrative to track)?


But not tied to anything, and therefore useless until it becomes paired with real world identifiable information.


*Maybe*.  If they aren't taking *any* steps to obfuscate that.
And this concern is being addressed.  Currently Monero (an altcoin) solves this problem in its core.  However, sidechains/atomic cross-chain swaps will bring this feature to bitcoin as well.


And you've also neglected the part where the government can freeze assets at its whim; this is very much a "permissioned" system.


False; you are unable to tie identity to transactions.


No, *you* have a fundamental misunderstanding of how modern currencies work.  You see, all the benefits you tout for modern currencies don't come from the currency themselves.  You are conflating *services* (like Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, etc) with *cash*.  Stop doing that.  Look at it this way; if I have $100 bill in my wallet and it drops out of my pocket, who reimburses me?  Regular cash has a serial number, which means it can theoretically be tracked.  Tell me how many coke dealers get busted because *serial numbers* can be tracked.  Now, sure, large scale bank robberies or drug cartels can end up getting tracked because of those serial numbers, but they are basically irrelevent to the regular user as long as he doesn't deposit that shit into his tracked bank accounts.


Again, you are completely failing to understand the *technical* breakthrough that bitcoin represents.  Digital scarcity is *revolutionary*.  There are lots of services that provide a better experience than *native* bitcoin transactions, just like there are lots of services that provide a better experience than *native* TCP/IP transactions (hint: browsers are an app built on top of TCP/IP).  But being able to represent something scarce, without an intermediary, in a world where copy+paste makes everything nearly infinitely copyable is a breakthrough.  It's use cases are far more than simply "currency" although it is one of the earliest use cases.

There are a few.
1.  LN will have a centralizing pressure as nodes with higher channel count means more value to the user.
2.  Without any on-chain expansion, LN will end up the de-facto way for most people to use bitcoin.
3.  LN will gravitate towards a hub and spoke model (due to  above) and that many of those hubs will require KYC/AML to open channels with.  If  occurs, the only affordable way to use bitcoin will be through large corporations who keep records, and the majority of privacy/anti-censorship properties of bitcoin will be reduced.

I see where the problem is.  Your understanding of *value* is not quite accurate.  Value is not synonymous with "properties".  Value is a subjective measure of desire.
Would you say that the *price* of artwork is decoupled from it's *value*?  Who are you to say that the value of something to someone else is the same as the value you put on the same thing?
Tulips during the tulip mania *did* have value.  They were a status symbol and difficult to cultivate.  Read your article and it'll explain to you that there were a plethora of reasons that the tulips in question became highly sought after.
Price always reflects value.  Read up on the [subjective value theory](  It stands to reason that price is always the point at which the producer is willing to part with it and the consumer is willing to trade for it.  This is obviously dynamic, but when a consumer looks at something and compares it to price, he can choose either the money or the good.  If he chooses the good then he has decided that it has value (whether it be because he can use it himself, or give it as a gift, or sell it again for more profit).
Price is a representation of value.  When you say "decoupled", you are referring to the "marginal utility" of a good vs its price, which *does* decouple regularly, because speculation is a thing, and is a component of value.

The theory goes if the RNG is not *sufficiently* random, you *could* have a problem and not know it.
It's hard to look at a few (even in the thousands) numbers and extrapolate whether or not they are truly random.
Best bet is to forego the use of a single key unless necessary.  Then, for a public address, say, you could let the transactions build and transfer in a batch style every 6 months or so (assuming you can afford to do that).

The problem with free markets as they currently exist is that in order to operate effectively they need "informed consumers".  Judging by the previous election and the campaigns associated with it, we are a far cry from "informed" as a general populous.
Also, "free" markets also need to be free from coercion.  You literally can't have a free market if one party can force you to comply on the threat of violence.  To try to prevent coercion, we as a species are currently trying to grant a monopoly on force to a single entity, and then provide a means by which the general populous can influence this monopoly.
Is it perfect?  I don't think so.  Is it better than some of the alternatives?  Definitely.  Are there better options?  Likely.  Life is like one big experiment that never ends.  Hopefully we're on the right track.

This isn't witty or clever.  This is fundamental.
Before bitcoin there was *no* way to represent a commodity digitally without a central third party.  None.  Bitcoin is the **first** digital commodity that doesn't require an intermediary.
No, it doesn't have fucking consumer protection.  Does Gold?  Silver?  Palladium?  Yet no one questions the fact that these have been traditional mediums of exchange.  Yes, the government went to fiat to control the money supply.  Yes, VISA provides a valuable service.  So what?  The point is we have cash for the internet; a truly valuable feat that makes a commodity scarce where there was previously no scarcity.

When it comes to consumer products purchased online, they dictate *most* of the terms.  Sellers are at a distinct disadvantage because they have to be where the buyers are.

Which relies on all information being available.
We work towards efficient markets with increases in the availability of information, but it's very difficult to know all information.  
For instance, if someone has "insider" information that causes them to trade, they *know* that the markets will react to their actions.  If they sell a lot all at once, the markets will notice and react.  People *intentionally* mislead the market by slowly selling positions if possible, or selling a good chunk for no external reason just to intentionally devalue the commodity.
If all information *could* be known, then EMH would perfectly reflect that.  But all information *can't* be known, and people know how markets react to certain situations, so there's literally no way for that to be perfectly possible.
With bitcoin, it's even worse because investors can be anyone at any time.  There are fewer barriers to entry so more uninformed investors are present.

Spending bitcoin is disincentivized by a number of reasons.  The price is going up; who wants to trade an appreciating asset for a depreciating asset (food, video games, computer hardware all go DOWN in value)?  This is encapsulated in [Gresham's Law](
Then there's the fact that credit cards offer rewards points.  These points are a partial compensation for the increased prices credit cards cause goods and services to be.  And you don't even have to pay interest if you pay them in full every month.  And they provide consumer protection.  And the in-person payment process is streamlined.
Then, as has already been mentioned, it's inconvenient.  
HODLing increases the value because it reduces effective supply.  The rising value of bitcoin will naturally encourage people to want to accept it.  And there are lots of use cases for bitcoin where it is *less* inconvenient than dollars.  International remittance, for instance.

Coinbase has a pretty solid history of not getting hacked (even though they have a highly visible presence in the bitcoin industry).  They also have insurance.  I maintain a hardware wallet for my large stash (like a safe), and use coinbase for transactional spending (like a savings and a checking account).  Once my "vault" gets big enough, I transfer to my hardware wallet.
But yea, if you get a hardware wallet, test it out by transferring a small amount to the wallet, and then formatting it.  If you followed the directions correctly and carefully, and wrote the seed down properly, you should be able to recover and see the balance you transferred to it.

No.  Coercion removes freedom from one of the parties.  It is mandatory in a truly "free" society that all parties are free to make their own decisions based on merit and not on threat of violence.


That blanket statement is untrue.  By codifying the heinousness of murder, we communicate as a society that it is terrible.  This provides a large deterrent because it ingrains the aversion to murder from a young age.  It takes a large amount of desire to overcome this aversion in healthy adults.  So yes, the illegality of it and the potential for justice definitely DOES stop *someone* who wants to commit it.  It doesn't *eliminate* it (because humans are imperfect) but it definitely reduces its occurance.


We definitely don't offload the enforcement of *all* societal ideals.  You are allowed to be a dick, but people won't want to hang out with you.  You are allowed to smell bad, but again, that hinders your social status.  You presume that peer influence is nonexistent, and that's crazy.

That money was lost, but not as a result of government injection of liquidity, which is what we're talking about.  Yea, that shit was bad, but it was private corporations in private contracts with private individuals; the government "injection" was paid back, and thus did not increase the money supply in aggregate.


Not necessarily; as above, those injections were *loans*, not *free money*.  So the aggregate value of the dollar is not meaningfully impacted.

A few key points:
1) There are benefits to bitcoin beyond an increase in value.
2) Pyramid marketing is not illegal; see Mary Kay or Tupperware.  What's illegal is when there's no product to sell (or a marginal product) and the only benefit (or largest benefit) is recruitment of others who pay only to recruit others.
3) Bitcoin doesn't have *downstream* payments so you literally can't build a pyramid.  At most you get a patio with some stairs.
4) First buyers don't make the most; many of them sold on smaller upswings.  It's not guaranteed.  I had 40 bitcoin when they were $5 a piece.  When they went to $30 I sold almost all of them for $1200.  Nice turnaround for a good family Christmas vacation.  Kicking myself now, but here we are.  People who bought in Dec 2017 are kicking themselves now while people buying now are potentially poised to make much more if there is an upswing.  Timing is everything, and it's not about being first.
5) Other assets behave similarly in the market.  People who buy land first in a popular city benefit the most.  People who buy stocks first (*and hold*) in a popular company benefit the most.  Turns out when you take the risk, you reap the reward.

Bingo.  By being a large consumer of goods and services (only paying in USD), providing assistance (in USD) and requiring taxes to be paid in USD, the US government creates a large ecosystem where the only thing that works is the dollar.  Sure, other ecosystems may emerge, but if the US Government is having problems with USD like you surmise, they aren't worried as much about which currency people are using as much as they're worrying about whatever is causing said hyper-inflation.
When you look at the other countries that have experienced hyper-inflation, those were usually a result of much larger systemic issues and smaller governments focused on currency were not tackling the problems causing the currency crisis.  Venezuela right now is having a currency crisis because of its over-reliance on oil (which OPEC has basically told Venezuela that they're fucked).  The Weimar government in 1920s Germany had to contend with massive reparations and war costs that made it hard for them to borrow money, a problem the US doesn't have.  They printed *excessively* and very *quickly*, something the Federal Reserve takes pains to prevent, having learned from history.
I don't think the US will have a hyper-inflationary event.

Because the consensus rules are nearly identical with only a small change meant to increase the capacity of an existing coin?


Therefore all hard forks in perpetuity are "altcoins"?  That's horseshit and you know it.


Only by *your* definition and the definition of 1x nodes.  


Bitcoin *Legacy* or Bitcoin *Classic* or Bitcoin *1X* nodes.  


It's *not* irrelevant, that's not what I indicated.  What I indicated is that it's not *technically* relevant to the consensus *rules* but that it is relevant to the more broad *community* consensus


Right now Coinbase, for instance, has indicated that it considers both forks to be "bitcoin candidates" since their consensus code is so similar.  They will be using mining power to help them ascertain which way to go, because it is the most reliable way to determine consensus, considering the similarity of the two consensus rules.
And honestly, if another alt had more hashpower than bitcoin, I'd suspect many people would use it.  If the mechanism was different enough, I'd hazard to say the community would reject "bitcoin" as a term for this theoretical altcoin, but if the "altcoin" was in fact a simple fork of the bitcoin network with few changes to the consensus code, most people would still call it bitcoin.

That's a pretty big assumption; how do you know this is their motive?  It seems to me that people have been trying since Bitcoin Unlimited to remove what they see as a pretty big impediment to adoption.  Pretending that lots of people have been clamoring for this change for a long time is disingenuous.


What is malicious about it?  No replay protection?  This is only a problem if you believe a significant number of people will adopt it or that it will have value.  If you think it's garbage then why is it malicious?


It's most definitely not false.  Hashpower works together to create a consensus of history.  That isn't consensus of the code being run, but consensus of the history.  The chain with the most hashpower will have the history that is most secure.


Yea, maybe if you call him names it'll invalidate the fact that large amounts of mining power is *good* for bitcoin.  Maybe if you hurt his feelings he'll say he's sorry and continue with 1mb until fees are $100 a pop.

There's a lot of shit to say about Roger Ver that is legitimate.  I just dislike blatant character assassination. "It's a piece of the puzzle" only if the puzzle is an attempt to discredit him without criticizing his arguments.  It's a sleazy way to win an argument.
Bitcoin Cash sucks because it still has transaction malleability problems, which make it difficult to deploy layer 2 solutions and thus Bitcoin Cash will stagnate.
Bitcoin Core has fixed the transaction malleability but with segwit, and thus paves the way for some awesome innovations. 
The 8mb block size is not, by itself, very impressive.  Who gives a fuck about Roger Ver or Jihan Wu or whoever is backing it?  It is *technically inferior* and thus all this extra noise detracts from that.

Depends on your perspective.




Agreed; but that's assuming that they *want* an irreversible system, which most people don't.  You have to realize that Visa/Mastercard stay in business because the vast majority of their transactions clear, so *irreversibility* isn't a major feature people seek since it feels irreversible for so many.  I agree that *some* people need this feature, and so bitcoin serves well in those situations, but for most, irreversibility is *dangerous* because mistakes can't be rectified without the goodwill of the  merchant, whereas Visa/Mastercard serves as a "trusted" third party that handles disputes.


That may be true but they also spend a ton of money *doing lots of stuff*.

Yea, they most definitely fiddle with the ledger.  But their goal has and continues to be convincing people not to hold their fiat currency.  It is not *meant* to be a store of value, only a medium of exchange.  It's value is designed to decline slowly in a stable manner to convince people to move to other stores of value.  This movement is called the velocity of money and as the velocity goes up, so do taxes (since they take a cut from every transaction).   


No, the game has rules.  There's a difference.


You are currently free to transact in whatever way you wish.  Only in taxes and debt incurred do you *have* to use USD.  And that's only for standardization purposes, not to fuck you over.

They didn't agree to "control" bitcoin.  They agreed that a change was required and then implemented it.  That's the key to successful business; seeing where change is needed and then implementing it.


No, the objective is to upgrade bitcoin to 2x the capacity.


No it's not.  It may be harmful to the main chain but that's not the definition of malicious; malice requires intent.


There are two types of consensus.  The consensus code in bitcoin creates a consensus for those running the same consensus code.  The broader consensus is obviously split because the fork is occuring.  I'd argue that 1x does not have consensus either because people want to change it. 


Except the agreement was between a number of companies and not the single "evil player" so many people have singled out.

Colloquially though, and especially in this sub, a conspiracy has the connotation of being secret and behind closed doors.  While the agreement was not done in a public forum, the announcement, the intent, the code and the release date were all made public.  This is not a *conspiracy* in the vernacular of this sub, it is an agreement and an execution.


So by that logic Core developers currently "control" bitcoin?  They do that on the regular.


Ah, so because they aren't protecting *other chains* then they are de facto attacking them?  That wouldn't be an issue if ther wasn't support for 2x like so many here seem to believe.  If there's no support, there will be no use of the 2x chain and any replays on the 2x chain will be meaningless.
If, however, there *is* sufficient support, then replays become an issue.  Therefore either there is no support and replay protection is not necessary, or there *is* support in which case replay protection is unnecessary except to protect the 1x chain.  In neither case is it in their interests to spend time or energy to implement replay protection.  It's just the cliff's edge being clinged to to convince people that this is evil.

I think the word "consensus" is ambiguous and that is causing confusion.
There are two "consensus" definitions:
1) The broad agreement between participants in the space about the direction the project should go.
2) The specific set of rules that must be adhered to when creating a block that are also used to verify that a block is valid.
For  no of course miners don't control this consensus.  They are but one piece of the puzzle.
For  this "consensus" is just the rules that everyone on the same network follow to continue participating in that network, where network in this context is defined by the set of people running compatible consensus code.  Number 2, the miners definitely DO decide which consensus rules they individually run, and if they collectively decide to run a different, incompatible set than they were before, they will fork.  The fork will have a specific amount of mining power, and more mining power equates to more security so many will follow the hashrate.
Not sure why this is so debatable.  I believe that the different definitions are what causes so much confusion.
Miners dictate which consensus rules they will adhere to.  Whichever rules you also adhere to (or people acting on your behalf) is the consensus you participate in.  So miners *do* decide consensus, in one manner and *do not* in another.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:35:18


There *is* a consensus among a large group of people.


The protocol *is* changing.  Just because you don't want the change doesn't mean it's not changing.  Like saying the segwit chain shouldn't be called bitcoin because some people didn't want it.


I never said it did.  What I implied was that large companies have vested interests which means they're more likely to be making sound decisions since they have more skin in the game.  Also their decisions influences others directly and indirectly.


But there are a *lot* of people who are capable of doing these things, but as value increases, more people will be incentivized to deal with it.


*Whims* has the connotation that this change isn't *years* in the making supported by people like Gavin Andreson (who was one of the original bitcoin core developers).

Value can be found all over the place.
He bought bitcoin 5 years ago and held it, creating scarcity and encouraging others to buy in.
Yea, that's value.  Just because he didn't use muscles for it doesn't devalue it.
The feel-good bullshit is acting like because someone didn't sweat for it, they must not deserve it and you are just waiting for karma to come around and reward you for the work you did and bring low the people who obtained wealth in other ways.
The truth is, people *voluntarily* give up their money for things they value.  That *may* be rent; someone else is taking the risk of losing the property for you and they deserve some recompense for it.  It *may* be investments, where someone saw potential and acted on it at the right time.
Yea, some people get rich through luck.  But they still *provided value*, even if it was just coincidental.  Inheritance is the parent bestowing the value they've accumulated on their child.
What people seem to miss about money is that it is simply *debt to society*.  Think about it this way; before money, people lived in small communities or groups.  It was *easy* to keep track of who had done favors for who.  If you helped me mend my roof when it was leaking, I would be inclined to assist you when your spearheads broke.  This is a very communal form of living (note the similarity to the word communism) and it works great because accountability is high.  But when civilizations grow, accountability drops because we don't know each other.  Using a shared ledger (or money) helps us keep track.  When you fix my roof now, instead of paying you back by helping you in the future, I just give you money, which is society's promise to give you something of value in the future.
The idea that rich people are just lucky assholes misses the point that the way they obtained their money *doesn't matter* (assuming it was all legally obtained, stealing is no bueno).  They ended up with a bunch of promises from society to provide them with value.  If they want to pass their promises to their children, then why is there anger towards those children?  If they obtained those promises by finding oil on their property, then why is there anger towards them for their luck?
I'll never understand why people are so upset that other people have more than them.  If you want more, figure out a way to provide value in such a way that you give more to society than you are taking out of it.

That's not as dire as it sounds.  Replay protection can be performed individually. 


So does not forking.  Does that mean that since staying the same lacks consensus, then it is an attack too?


And the developers are deliberately ignoring user input


False; it is widely regarded as necessary, only the *when* is contentious.

It *absolutely* is a reflection of value.  Maybe you don't like the type of value they provide but they *do* provide value.
Bankers were providing loans for people who were completely willing to sign on the dotted lines for houses they knew they couldn't afford because some assets just appreciate forever, right?
You may provide *intangible* value to your family and friends, but everyone else doesn't give a shit about you (and why should they?)  The only way to get people who don't know you to give you their time and energy is to provide them with something in return.

People value entertainment a little all the time.  They value treatments for cancer once, maybe twice?

I'm arguing that an "altcoin" has one of these two properties at a minimum:
1) Strongly divergent code base
2) Different genesis block.
If either one of these is not true, then it is a bitcoin *update*.  Whether or not it is a good update is not the point of contention.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:27:10


I should have clarified; 2x doesn't require you to change address formats (which requires transferring funds and paying fees).  Segwit does.


How much notice is needed?  The 2x hard fork was originally proposed in Hong Kong in *2016*.  At some point people are going to say "This is ridiculous; we need relief from fees now, and we don't want to wait until an economy builds up around a feature that we just got".  Segwit's adoption is slow.  I've still not seen a single commercial application of LN.  I'm very excited about these technologies, but they *aren't really helping* the immediate problem of high fees.


As bitcoin grows, this requirement is going to asymptotically approach 0% probability.  Different people want different things.

See, this is what I keep hearing, but IT'S NOT AN ALTCOIN if the codebase is more than 90% of bitcoin's codebase and it shares the same genesis block.
Hard-forks are necessary for upgrading some aspects of bitcoin.  You can't go around calling it an "alt" just because you don't like it.
We need to start recognizing that a hard-fork with the intent of upgrading bitcoin is not an "alt".  It's an upgrade attempt.
The whole point of bitcoin is that no one is in complete control, yet this sub acts like if the core developers didn't do it, then it's not legitimate, which gives them a form of central control.
I for one am happy to see contention result in forks instead of stalling.  Maybe now we can start to actually evaluate the merits of the different ideas.  For instance, we now have better data on the Difficulty adjustment mechanism and what changes can do to it.  We also have better data on how competing coins can affect the hashrate of bitcoin.  Bitcoin Cash gave us this and I believe that even though Bitcoin Cash is faulty (leaving segwit behind was stupid IMHO), it's experiment provided us with an environment more rich with data.

I'll give these a shot, although my understanding may also be imperfect.  Others, don't be afraid to correct me where I'm wrong.
1. Some kind of mining optimization.  Reverse engineering just showed that it was built into some hardware, which implies that resistance to segwit may be because it neutralizes the built in boost, thereby removing the benefit of the extra capital spent on them.
2.  My impression is it is easier to implement with segwit, and that it has been deployed and tested on some form of segwit enabled testnet.
3.  I believe the 95% is only for the segwit rollout to activate and is a BIP specific threshold.  Some core changes are just outright implemented if they don't cause a potential fork, but changes that do cause a fork look for consensus in some manner for safety reasons.
4.  I don't know; I dont pay much attention to BU.
5.  UASF will implement sets it in those nodes beginning August 1, and reject blocks that didn't adhere to its specification.
6.  UASF is just the activation mechanism.  Segwit is a separation of transaction data and signature data.
7.  UASF activates a feature that core has proposed.
8.  A pool run by bitmain, the owner who is jihan Wunder.
9.  I'll tell you when you're older.

Or you could create a new chain with your software.  These are known as "alt-coins" because they also attempt to link blocks together in a chain, although they might do it differently.

Not really.  You could call me a naysayer maybe.  I just dislike when everyone starts cheering each other on in a politicized forum; it's healthy to have dissenting voices.


I'd rather have bitcoin than bitcoin cash because I'm very pro segwit.  I do *not* believe that Blockstream is somehow spearheading a long con bitcoin takeover.  I think LN has some centralizing pressures, but I think it could be super useful in the future.
I think in the larger sense Core developers are on the right track.  Efficiencies like Schnorr signatures will ease fee sizes.  I believe Segwit2X was a healthy compromise but that was *shit all over* and now people are surprised that the ones who got fucked out of their side of the bargain are upset.

There's at least a third option; keep your bitcoin and run a full node using whatever code suits you best.
The miners follow demand, and if the demand is high enough, they'll turn away from their current trajectory.

@_date: 2017-04-13 12:35:16


No, proof of work is a tool to generate consensus by requiring a cost (work) in order to contribute to the chain.  By doing so, people will only contribute via mining to the longest chain (where their efforts will bear fruit) as opposed to mining on all chains (which is the "nothing at stake" problem of proof of stake).
The every 10 minutes bit is a difficulty level, which just dictates *how hard* proof of work is.  And POW doesn't massively reduce the chance of collisions; that's the mempool's job.

I'd agree with that in general, but you're looking at it from a private investment standpoint, where the investor owns the product.  There's a political aspect here that you are neglecting.


Sure, but again, remember that blockstream has an agenda that may not match the desires/needs of the majority of bitcoin users.


I've been on plenty of projects whose timeline was a year or more.  We're talking about the world's largest cryptocurrency experiment, and coordinating changes with a userbase that size is no small feat.


Sure; but those putting up the resources don't always have the same incentives as the user base, and that can, again, be difficult to implement.

Sure, based on your definition.  But a tweak to the code and then re-deploy doesn't feel the same as "walking", so I'd argue that your definition is a little too broad.  I'd define walking as either getting out of bitcoin altogether or going and using a different coin with a different genesis block.  To use the same genesis block and tweak the code is not quite *walking* in my book; it's attempting to change the definition of *valid* as seen by the majority of users + miners.

FDIC can only cover a certain amount.  


I mean, since they can basically set the cost of a dollar, it **really** isn't, but the truth is the debt of the US is vastly outgrowing the gdp.  Look at [this chart](  While sovereign governments can always issue more currency to service their debt, and are never technically in danger of defaulting, there comes a point where servicing the debt through printing devalues the currency to a point where no one wants to use it.  Now, the US has been exporting the demand for US dollars to countries who need stability in their currency, which they gain by backing their currency with dollars or accepting it directly.  However, if we continue to print in order to service our debt, we'll eventually run out of people willing to use our dollars, and inflation will begin to rear its ugly head.  At that point, US dollars will begin to fall in relation to other assets like gold, oil or bitcoin.  
Maybe it's not as dire as some people like to think (people like doomsday scenarios; haven't you ever seen people secretly cheering for hurricane falls, for instance?), but the truth is that the monetary policy in the US needs to reverse course before it tips past a point that can be controlled.  Some people believe it has already passed that point.  I'm not so sure but it's definitely trending that direction.

No, I'm looking for higher transaction throughput.  Bitcoin is a settlement layer; even with bigger blocks 10 minute confirm time is not good for many transactions.

?  Of course they do.  The US mint spends a lot of time worrying about these very things.  Like, for instance, the copper in a penny is worth more than one cent.  That makes it difficult for one cent to equal one cent.  If they didn't forbid melting down pennies for their copper content, people would do so and pennies would leech out of circulation.


Sure, but that's *individual* fungibility; which is also true of any cash you may have.  I'd rather use a $1 bill than break $100.  That means that $100 is worth *just slightly more* than 100 $1 bills because people would rather have the $100 than 100 $1 bills.  And, because $100 are commonly counterfeited, they are less likely to be accepted at many stores.  This fungibility is something people *do* care about.

There isn't some magical "institution" of marriage; marriage is an agreement between people; there's a romantic aspect, a legal aspect, (sometimes) a religious aspect and (sometimes) a family aspect.  Truly, it's a personal thing in all but the legal aspect.  Why does letting other people have the privilege of the legal aspect hurt your institution?

Bitcoin doesn't have "an equivalent value" in real currency because its value fluctuates, so it is not "equivalent" (which I would take to mean is constant).  WoW Gold wouldn't have an equivalent value in real currency either.  That would be like a virtual currency pegged to the dollar, like if 100 points equaled a single dollar, those points would have the equivalent value in real currency of $.01.  So neither WoW Gold nor Bitcoin qualifies because of "equivalent value".
WoW gold does *not* act as a substitute for real currency; only *certain* items are for sale using WoW gold and those items are under the purview of the issuer; Blizzard.  There exists no legal market for trading WoW gold for things other than WoW digital merchandise; anywhere you can do so is explicitly prohibited by Blizzard and therefore WoW gold does *not* act as a substitute for real currency.  Bitcoin, however, *does* act as a substitute for real currency in that there are no entities actively discouraging their use in a given economy, so they can be used to purchase *anything* without violating any terms of service (and therefore being illegal).
Just because a black market exists doesn't mean that WoW gold acts as a substitute for real currency.  Further, there is no legitimate way to convert WoW gold into real currency; it can only be traded for in-game content legally.

People don't want to have to trade their currency for goods/services immediately, so good currency doesn't lose value or gains/loses it *very* slowly.

Yes, I'd agree with your addendum.

Look at the [second reply down](
Consensus is determined by mining.  That's literally *what bitcoin is*.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:30:15


But the definition of validity in this context depends on the consensus rules that you run.  Coinbase is taking the position that it is a valid block.  That is implied here and it is weird that you are arguing it is not.  Validity is dependent on the consensus rules (the rules we all agree to), and people are modifying those rules.  If enough people agree with those rules, that's the direction bitcoin will go and blocks that conform to that set of consensus rules will be "valid" according to the participants.


No, they argue that their consensus change is a valid consensus change, and therefore the blocks that conform to it are valid.  Coinbase obviously agrees, but has gone so far as to say they'll wait and see which chain they honor.  That IMHO is fantastic; they've already accepted 2X as valid, but will *still* call the 1X chain "bitcoin" if that is what the community decides.  Staying neutral and not taking sides.


Assuming the chain has an acceptable consensus mechanism, which was implied at the outset.

Well, it obviously takes a client modification to ignore a chain with the longest PoW, but otherwise yea, it's pretty much on a whim.


Open source, freely available, easily modifiable set of consensus rules that I can modify any time I want.


Nope, only the people who want to agree have to agree; if someone else doesn't they go off on their merry way.


Technically no, but in ETH vs ETC yea, they were onboard too.  But they don't *have* to be, literally the miners alone can decide to mine another chain.  Whether or not the rest of the ecosystem follows is *also* freedom; they don't have to.


Either you seriously misunderstand or you are trolling.  51% is literally just the majority deciding to mine a different chain than the one that is currently the longest in order to modify history.  Because they have 51% (or more), they'll overtake the minority chain by nature of having more mining power, at which time their chain will be followed by the rest of the clients, whether they want to or not.

No it doesn't "destroy it", but you must understand fungibility isn't binary as in it either "is", or it "isn't".
A silver dollar from 1960 has silver content worth like $15.  Which would you take as payment for a $1 transaction, knowing this fact?  A dollar bill or the silver dollar?  If you said silver dollar, you just proved that cash isn't *completely* fungible.

“It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.”
ASSUMING you both have already agreed on the consensus rules to run.  If you don't agree on the rules, you won't work together.  The miners decide which rules to generate blocks on.  You're free to reject them or not.
Bitcoin is literally saying "We're all going to run this ok, and as long as we agree on this code, we can make sure that the transactions submitted conform to this code".  These people are deciding to change that code.  Satoshi *literally* did this himself by introducing the block limit *in the first place*.


The B2X model is literally just a code change.  You're speaking about the *Coinbase* model, and there is an implied constraint that Coinbase has to accept that the consensus rules are worth following to begin with.


Sigh.  Decentralized is decentralized *transaction verification*.  We're currently super centralized in our code generation; Core is it.  It's ironic that you speak of decentralization as a whole while defending the centralized developer group.


No, you're confused.  The consensus dictated by miners is the consensus that everything currently conforms to the code being executed.  They make the blocks, they ultimately decide which transactions are verified or not *based on the current ruleset*.  They don't dictate which ruleset to choose; they only dictate that the ruleset chosen is being enforced.  Coinbase is saying "Both of these rulesets *could* be bitcoin, so whichever has the most security is the better option".


You have it seriously twisted.  The users are free to do as they wish, there is no B2X model.  People have decided to fork bitcoin.  Coinbase has decided that their fork is viable if enough miners support it.  You are free to not use Coinbase as you wish.  You are framing the narrative as if the miners can tell you what to do.  You are free to use the 1x chain, mine on it or do whatever.  But the "name" that the longest chain receives?  That's up to the people using it what they want to call it.


Bitcoin is designed to have the miners work in their own best interest and have that interest aligned with users.  If bitcoin's survival depends on the altruistic acts of miners against their own interest, then bitcoin has failed.


Because the miners *don't* dictate which rules you follow.  They decide which rules they follow and you either follow their security or you don't.  Coinbase has made their stance known.  You obviously disagree.  But miners aren't *dictating* anything.

There is no modification of the consensus mechanism other than larger block sizes.  The whole argument is about *Coinbase* deciding that the most accumulated work is the valid bitcoin chain, not the consensus rules making determinations.
Hashrate can only be determined by number of blocks.  You can't look at a block and go "OH, that block has the highest hashrate".
I think either you are seriously confused or I am completely misunderstanding your point.
The change in november is just a blocksize change.

You skipped the debatable part about *what* level that is and whether or not it will affect the current state of affairs.


LOL So any hard fork that maintained the name "bitcoin" would be fraud?  That's a very broad interpretation and basically makes a non-fraudulent hard fork impossible.


I'd say "Coinbase" was committing fraud but that would only be if the entire ecosystem agreed that the coin was not in fact bitcoin.  If it's split, that's not fraudulent because there is a good faith reason to believe that the hardfork resulted in bitcoin and legacy bitcoin. 
Couldn't the same logic apply if the majority of users accepted the hard fork and then people were calling the legacy chain "bitcoin"?  Wouldn't that be just as fraudulent?

False equivalence.  They've failed for lots of reasons besides increased capacity.  In fact, this very clearly demonstrates my point; most hashrate = most successful.

Agreeing to just throw out a few blocks is not a hard fork...  Blocks are orphaned all the time.  Old clients will follow the new chain w/out the blocks if it's total PoW is greater.  So no, it's a soft fork.
It *can* be a hard fork, but it doesn't *have* to be a hard fork.  Hard forks are when new blocks don't conform to old rules.  Just orphaning a chunk of blocks is a *soft* fork; the blocks generated from that point still conform to the same consensus mechanism.

Here is the quote you mentioned.  


vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to
confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
I'm not sure how it ties in because this speaks of SPV nodes, which are nodes that literally only verify based on someone else's nodes.  In the whitepaper, full nodes are *mining nodes*.  They *are* the miners.


Well, the intent was that users were miners.  That's no longer the case.   It *is* trustless in that you can verify whether transactions occured or not.  It is *decentralized* in that no one person verifies the transactions.  If it's there *everyone agreed* that the transaction follows the consensus mechanisms.
It's *which* consensus mechanisms to follow that miners get to decide.  You are free to continue using whichever chain you choose, but the less miners = less security.  So the majority of economic nodes will follow the highest security chain.


Your link doesn't make sense here; how is it not ending well because miners are mining empty blocks?  And what power are we putting in the hands of the miners?  We both already agreed that hashrate is a *lagging indicator* and therefore they have no *power* to dictate who uses which chain.  They just have the ability to dictate which chain is the *most secure*.

No, as outlined above.  There is no *dictation*.  You are free to run 1X/Legacy/Classic forever.  But if the miners switch, your chain falters.
See, the premise you are operating off of is that miners are not also users.  That somehow they are a distinct class separate from you or me.  But the truth is, you are free to open a datacenter that runs the consensus code of your choice.  The fact that you aren't doesn't make it out of reach for you based on anything other than your personal life scenario.  These people are not forcing you to do *anything* in either model.  These people have decided to run different code.  They are perfectly within their right to do so.  If enough people use it, they feel that it should be called bitcoin.  You are free to call it "zingledoods" if you want, but Coinbase also has that right.  And if Coinbase and Bitpay and Xappo and Breadwallet and Mycelium and Gemini and Kraken and all the other large names in the space begin calling 2X "bitcoin", then you'll be left calling it "zingledoods" and no one will understand you.

There are a lot of risk factors, and no I'm not extremely confident because there is a lot of resistance; I'm not able to easily tell where the consensus lies.  That doesn't somehow make 2x less viable.  IPv4 is a technically worse choice than IPv6.  However, IPv4 is still in use today because of network effect.  There's a possibility that many people won't upgrade.  
But there's (according to the $1000 price tag) about a 1/6 chance that they *will*.

Nowhere is the mention of 1mb found in the whitepaper.  That was added later.  So truly, to adhere to the whitepaper, there should be no block size limit.


So a single dissenting voice can kill a hard fork?  That's preposterous and you know it.  Consensus is *broad agreement* not *total, 100% everyone in the world" agreement.

Yes; as long as transactions are flowing through your node then it matters.  A replicated node everywhere may help *a little* by rejecting transactions/blocks that don't fit current consensus.  But if the majority of users are moving in a different direction, your node just gets left behind with a dead chain.
If enough people *use* the node they're running for transactions, then it matters.
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:33:55
I recall a similar discussion when litecoin first came out and the math worked out that the *first* confirmation provides an elevated level of security (confirms that the transaction was indeed broadcast, was verified and found to be formatted correctly, etc), but subsequent confirmations were pretty linearly correlated with time after that point.

And I'm saying, this is how every consensus based blockchain system works.  Either you go along with the blocks that are mined or you don't use their network...


So people have invested millions of dollars and somehow they shouldn't have a say in how the network they are creating/maintaining works?


Yes, and the original reference implementation had no block size except for an inherent one of 32 megs.  That was added in later.  The reference implementation didn't have segwit either.  Should we not call it bitcoin now that it has segwit?


If *all* the major players go along with it, they won't be deceiving the public.  Definitions are not *set in stone*; they change over time.  Language is by consensus too, and if the consensus is that "bitcoin" is defined by 2mb blocks, then that's what it is.  I don't understand how you think that you get to define bitcoin but the majority don't.


Those companies are made up of many users, and I don't know how you can claim that you have any idea what the consensus is (yes, there were a few polls, but as we saw in the last US election they don't really mean shit).


Well considering that bitcoin's value is dropping, I'm in fiat.  We'll see how things go but I'm not really a betting man.  Just tired of people acting like their side is the "one true side" and that everyone else is "stupid" or "ignorant" or "completely missing the point".

You are saying that the hashrate is a lagging indicator and not a leading indicator.  This is *exactly* why Coinbase is waiting; they believe it to be a lagging indicator as well.  So After 48 hours (or potentially more) the hashrate will point to the chain that the most market participants want (since miners will mine the chain with the most profits).
The miners are signalling that they want 2x by an overwhelming majority.  They may start there.  But as the market participates, they'll switch to the chain where more profit is being made.

How often does this happen now?  Your pie in the sky dream of remote African villages running full nodes off of solar power is currently not happening, so why should that be a constraint going forward?


I'm sorry, but this is a ridiculous constraint; full nodes will be incentivized by market participants, not hobbyists.


Except that there's disagreement about whether it *is* or *isn't* and so it's not fraud.


That's what Coinbase is *doing*.  Whoever has the most hashrate post split is going to be the coin that most people are supporting.  Hashrate is a lagging indicator, thus a need for a period of time post split to determine which chain the network dubs to be bitcoin.


You're framing the narrative.  They didn't put in replay protection because it's an *upgrade to the existing system*.  You don't protect against *other chains*.  That's not fraudulent.  It may be a little pretentious, but to frame it as fraud is attributing malice without proof and that is fundamentally against my definition of justice; you can't just make accusations because of how you feel.  That's why the US has the concept of "Innocent until proven guilty".


Come on with the hyperbole.  The size of the block is not going to single-handedly stop bitcoin from revolutionizing the space.  That's ridiculous.

I mean, doesn't this imply that no matter when a hardfork happens, it's going to be a problem?  The attempts to create larger blocks (XBT, Bitcoin Unlimited) have been occurring for years.  When do you say "fuck it" and just fork?  


Fair criticism.  I'd also like to see more studies done, because both sides claim to have solid reasons for their stance (big blocks = centralization, 2mb isn't that big and != centralization) but *neither side* has solid data to back up their assertions.  The studies show that bigger blocks can be supported, but not with segwit (since witness data is handled differently, it could change things since it can be handled differently (pruned more quickly, things like that).


Well that's good to hear; I'd much rather discuss things like this with someone open to change their mind.  I'm often confronted with ideologues who worship 1mb as a religion.  It's frustrating.


And the argument is that for this specific issue, people have been screaming from the rooftop for *years* that this needs to be addressed, and some people are fed up and have decided to go do it on their own.  A lot of economic players are backing the solution too.

Where do you come up with this?  The rejection of a block is based on which consensus code you run.  If they run different consensus code, you're free to reject it.  If they change it now and you agree, and they change it later and you don't, *you don't have to upgrade*.  This is a weird argument.


How is that any different than now?


That's patently false and you know it.  The "B2X Model" is precisely the same model we currently run under.  They're just changing the consensus code.  You still haven't explained how that's different than the current model.

Again, historically it is not a good store of value.  *Obviously* USD is a *reasonable* **short-term** store of value (otherwise people wouldn't use it).  But they intentionally build in inflation to *reduce* its store of value to encourage people to get out of it and into other commodities (which is presumed to build the economy), which makes it *historically* a bad store of value. 
A good store of value doesn't lose value over time.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:02:27
Currency is not necessarily a store of value, nor does it have to be.  I don't think anyone would argue that USD is *not* a currency; however, it's (designed to be) a bad store of value. 
It needs to have a *relatively stable* value, but that value can decline over time without untoward effects.  If that decline is predictable and steady it's not an issue.

No, it's Coinbase looking for a way to determine the community's decision.  Mining is a *lagging* indicator of the most popular chain (as the most popular chain generates the most money).  The easiest way to determine that is to watch which chain gets the most hashpower for a period of time (like 48 hrs).  Without an emergency difficulty adjustment it'll be pretty clear in 48 hours what the majority of users want.

This isn't a model that they've adopted, it's the current model that bitcoin uses *right now*.


Yep; that's how it works now.


And if that plays out, then Coinbase agrees with you and its settled.  (Dusts hands off).


Yes, I understand that.  I disagree that it's meaningless though because if this comes to be it will demonstrate that it's not meaningless, it's just a lagging indicator as opposed to a leading indicator.  I believe price and hashrate to be positively correlated.  We don't disagree on causation, but we disagree that correlation is not meaningless.  It's a great way to determine whether the community agrees with a decision, which *is exactly what coinbase is doing*.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:03:52

But it's not just volatility of Bitcoin that affects the price, it's also the volatility of the local currency.
Even if Bitcoin's value remains relatively stable, if the dollar loses value, then the exchange rate changes.

Most of what you say I completely agree with.  However, my problem is with the absolute stance.  If implementing 2mb would completely unify the space, why would no one propose an alternate implementation that includes wishlist items?  Why is it that this is the *only* current proposal for how to implement increased chain scaling?  Schnorr sigs sound great.  Where's the implementation for them being worked on?  LN is great, but it's incomplete as it requires funds to be locked to transact, which can be inconvenient and only applies to a subset of transactions.  We have cross-chain-atomic swaps now from chain to chain but we aren't seeing that in widespread usage.


Adding 1mb to the chain doesn't prevent the wishlist hardfork from waiting and hardware can handle 2mb now (there are 2 different studies published that support this assertion, one by bitfury and one by students/faculty from Cornell University).
The truth is, pragmatically a hard fork could be implemented now to give on-chain scaling *without any major downside* and it would unite the community to allow it to pass.
The vigor with which people oppose it is not proportional to the benefit achieved from abandoning it.

IF IT DIDN'T CONTAIN SEGWIT.  Bitcoin Cash is kicking the can down the road.  The upcoming hard fork is an attempt to make more room for the anticipated demand, including the demand for opening and closing payment channels (which are possible on Segwit2X).
I do not support leaving segwit behind and so completely disregarded bitcoin cash.  It's a weird chain with problems that come from the weird difficulty adjustments.  But most importantly it doesn't include segwit.
So 2X isn't *kicking the can down the road* because it incorporates segwit.  It's just an acknowledgement that the current limitation is *too small* for long term usage, even with segwit.  Some on-chain scaling must happen to avoid making it only accessible as a settlement layer.  And LN provides *some* scaling, but not *infinite* scaling until (if) it is widely adopted.  Even then, you have to lock coins into the channel, which means you need to be connected to someone with lots of channels, which incentivizes (*gasp*) centralization.

I recognize and understand determinism, even though it does not address quantum probability and uncertainty.  However, you've applied it as if it somehow addresses the difference between us and cells, when it does not.  Even if everything is deterministic, cells are *simple* and we are *complex*.  We learn and explore, and are capable of a multitude of tasks.  Cells are not.  Therefore, cells literally have no choice but to perform the function they are created for.  Even in a deterministic model, they only have a small number of paths for which they are suited to follow, which is not true of humans.  This is why we need a fundamentally different model for interaction than they do.  
You can continue to cry that our current model is somehow a "disease", but until you can demonstrate an alternative, you're just blowing hot air out into the ether.
We literally cannot operate the same way cells do, because cells never "buck" the system; they aren't even aware that a system even exists.
Feel free to attempt to rebut, but until you provide any sources for serious alternatives to our current economic model that address human capabilities and tendencies, you're just waxing philosophical, which is common for college-age students who have just discovered philosophy 101, but not productive and a little immature.

Yea, that's true.  But now you've got two separate denominations with two separate economic systems.  Also, industrial use influences the price, which puts the physical commodity at a small disadvantage.
Also, I wouldn't ever advocate for a commodity backed currency to be the only currency.  Having a fiat currency has benefits; stability being a primary benefit.  
I'm just pointing out that the drawback of divisibility and transportability doesn't exist with bitcoin the same way it does with gold and silver. 
Stability is still an issue.  Maybe massive liquidity will reduce that problem.  But until then, fiat currency still has something to offer.

Quantity Theory of Money (for anyone not familiar) boils down to
    MV = PT
    M = Money Supply
    V = Velocity of Money
    P = Price Levels
    T = Total Value of all transactions
Money Supply in bitcoin is constant, so you posit that velocity must increase for total spending to increase.  However, with bitcoin, this will hold if price goes down as total aggregate value goes up.  Therefore, the quantity theory of money works fine for Bitcoin if you don't mind declining prices as aggregate value increases. I make the following assumptions:
* Both the bitcoin world and major governments want T to increase.  
* Governments have the additional constraint that prices should remain stable.  Therefore they can only really twiddle with either M or V to increase T.  
* Bitcoin cannot twiddle with M, therefore only V and P are available to it.  
You contend that we must increase V to increase T.  
I contend that letting P fall is perfectly acceptable.

Neither do I; you assumed something here that you shouldn't have.


Yep, and thus requires a more complex mode of inter-operation between individuals besides simple signalling proteins.


Which should also make obvious the fact that the interoperability at the scale of cells does not necessarily parallel the interoperability of the more complex model.


Maybe we're talking past each other, but I'm speaking of the system of communication we are discussing relating to "money".  This system can be gamed. 


Not if determinism is accurate.  We are just as predictable, only more variables are required to be known.

Not sure how relevant this is, but he did say specifically that it will either be "worth" a lot or "worth" nothing.  Obviously that's not a direct quote using the word "fiat" or "dollars", but worth is expressed colloquially through a person's regional currency.




First of all, that's not necessarily true.  No one is required to invest in a given coin, so the introduction of a new coin does not guarantee an erosion of bitcoin's price.
Second, even if what you have stated were true, if the entire ecosystem experiences a rise in value, said erosion won't be noticed.
But the issue I have is that, very clearly, supply requires fungibility.  If Bitcoin has a specific price, introducing another coin (assuming 0 buys of said coin) has zero effect on Bitcoin's price.  However, introducing more Bitcoin *would* have an effect on Bitcoin's price.  This is different.
You're making the assumption that new coins will have value AND this value is the same value bitcoin provides (since the new coin, by your logic, must necessarily eat at the value of bitcoin).  Both of those assumptions are incorrect.  New coins may not have value, and thus will not dilute Bitcoin's price.  New coins may also operate in a manner that Bitcoin currently cannot, which means Bitcoin wouldn't be purchased anyways for such a use case.

Only if there are no alternatives.  No one says "The problem with real estate is that it rises in value year over year" or "The problem with stocks is that it rises in value year over year" or "The problem with X commodity that is not fiat rises in value year over year".  We have a pretty solid medium of exchange in the USD and the Euro and the Yen and other major currencies.  What we NEEDED was an alternative to these things.
Bitcoin is a medium of exchange and a store of value.
If the value of a commodity drops over time \(say, by inflating supply\), that commodity is not a good store of value. USD is not a good store of value.  It has been designed to only be a medium of exchange.  The inflation rate is *designed* to increase its velocity so as to bolster its value as a medium of exchange, at the expense of its utility as a store of value.  This is designed to get people out of the USD and into other commodities, which increases the velocity and stimulates growth. 
Bitcoin is not so compelled.  It is not a tool to increase the productivity of the country who issues it.  It is literally designed to be a store of value that is also easy to exchange.  That's the precise reason the protocol caps the supply.

Except that bitcoin is not the only currency.
We see massive bubbles in real estate and stocks because of this very thing.  The root cause is because of *target inflation rates*.  You say stagnant money is unproductive money, and that's true.  But that means that when people need their money to sit for a while (because they have no current need of it), they either have to put it at risk (as you say) or lose a little at a time.
We NEED a place where people can park their money without it losing value and without having to take on risk.  Right now there aren't a lot of options for that.
You could invest in Treasury Bonds if you live in the US.  But those are still "at risk" of government default (however low that might be).  Other countries may not have access to the same level of risk.

Man, I guess I have to be super specific.  The OP said that economies contract *because of phsyical commodities shortage*.  This is a problem *only if people can't easily transact with the commodity due to it's indivisibility*.  If it can divide endlessly, then even if a *single* bitcoin is all that is available for trade, it would still be enough for people to use to transact.  So I'll fix my statement just for you pumpkin:

Again, you're trying to use this *pedantic* argument to somehow conclude that onchain scaling wasn't in Satoshi's plan.  It *obviously* was; he started with 32 megs and then after changing it to 1mb he offhandedly discussed how to change it, as if it was an unimportant problem with an easy fix.
It is obvious from the manner in which he implemented it, the nature of block sizes previously, and his commentary on the future of the blockchain size that it was not intended to be forever set.
In fact, since there is no evidence that he had any plans for any kind of second layer that any discussion of scaling would have been *implied* to be onchain by Satoshi.

Are *you* serious?  Food requires a certain quantity of substance to sustain you.  If you can infinitely divide the calories, it doesn't change how many you need.  With bitcoin, the divisibility DOES change how many you need, because it's just a token for keeping track of exchange.  The decimal point doesn't matter with Bitcoin for this task, it can be a smaller fraction than 1/&lt;number of atoms in a candy bar&gt; and still potentially be worth a candy bar.  That's why it doesn't suffer the same fate as gold; there is no point where the ratio of purchasing power to commodity is not feasible for transactions.  If you don't understand this, I'll explain it again, let me know.


See above; Gold suffers from a problem of non-infinite divisibility.  Right now, trying to buy that candy bar I would need to shave off .02 grams of gold (or thereabouts) to make that transaction.  That's *not feasible*.  So having physical commodities for a currency is *bad* because it eventually hits a point where the divisibility is a barrier.  This is NOT TRUE of bitcoin.


The OP made the argument that at some point we run out of the physical commodity.  That means that the divisibility doesn't work anymore and makes it hard to transact.  This causes a retraction of the economy *until more can get sourced*.  With bitcoin, IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
You seem to be missing this fundamental concept.  The potential of infinite divisibility with bitcoin means that even with a capped supply WE'LL NEVER RUN OUT.  No commodity crunch because there is no way to RUN OUT.

I disagree.  USD still has a lot of benefits over bitcoin.  It is far more widely accepted, for one, and money (as a form of shared ledger) benefits from network effect; the more people that use a ledger, the easier it is to use that ledger as a common ledger.  
USD is also guaranteed by the most powerful government on earth and it's value has been relatively stable compared to just about any other commodity since 1913.  Yes, it depreciates in value, so you don't want to use it as a strong store of wealth, which is why you should buy more valuable goods (like stocks, bonds, real estate, 401k's, IRA's, precious metals or bitcoin for instance) with any excess money.  But for in person transactions, cash is fantastic because it has instant in-person settlement and denominating things in dollars has caused price stability which makes consumers more confident using it to transact as well.
Also, "the market" is actually composed of an almost fractal series of sub-markets with in it so there's no reason to believe that SOME markets will choose bitcoin and other markets will continue to choose fiat.

Again, you haven't addressed the point.  The token is just a method for representing a trade.  Gold works as a token of sorts, but the problem is if the token becomes too valuable it stops being good at representing small trades and becomes a less efficient token.  If you have no other tokens to use, this can slow down trade as the double coincidence of wants comes into play.
If, however, that token can divide infinitely, it's value can now grow infinitely with no detrimental effect on trade.
Of *course* the number of decimal places is arbitrary.  It's the potential to expand and contract based on the economy's need that makes it better than gold as a commodity-as-a-currency.
My whole point is that the inflation model of the US dollar is an attempt to address this; if the dollar gets too valuable, it stops being useful.  Since our goal is to grow our economy, without inflation this will inevitably happen to the dollar too.  Therefore they need inflation to keep the US dollar from experiencing this problem.  We *want* the US dollar to lose little bits of value over time so it doesn't force an economic contraction due to a loss of liquidity (like we experienced with gold).  Bitcoin doesn't have this problem.

Which decision supports decentralization though?  A Lightning Network *could* promote centralization by slowly pricing people out of the main chain.  Assuming LN is a success (which I expect it will be), if we keep 1mb block size limit, there will come a time when transaction fees will climb high enough that normal users won't be able to afford a single on chain transaction.  If (I emphasize *if* because there are a number of assumptions here that may not play out) this becomes the case, LN will be *the only way* most users get to transact.  This means they will control the keys, but LN nodes will become gatekeepers.  While this situation is better than the current banking system, it definitely creates censorship points where transactions can be denied due to government pressure.
An additional block size increase curtails this concern.

I don't.   But if you use that argument,  then the miners can run the code that they prefer,  which might end up causing some chains to become worthless. 


If UASF succeeds *without initial majority miner support* (didn't realize I needed to add that subtext,  but I'm happy to since you seem to have missed it) it will cause a reorg of the legacy chain.   


Thus isn't about *What* you want,  but how you plan to implement it,  don't you agree?


Segwit without a block size increase puts pressure to move people off chain and into an LN hub system.   Adding a 2mb size increase allays those fears.

How is it at a loss?  Those 80% of nodes *must include* the important nodes. 
Say there are 1000 nodes and 20% is exchanges and important nodes.  If those 20% *all* run this UASF then miners would be operating at a loss with only 20% of nodes implementing this UASF.   However,  if all 20% ignore the UASF then the 80% of nodes and 40% of miners would be operating at a loss.  
UASF has to convince the places where bitcoins are changed into fiat to reject miner coins if they don't implement the UASF.   If they can't do that,  the node count is meaningless.

Segwit &lt;&gt; UASF.  BU is not the only way to increase block size.  BU has a floating block size voted on by miners.  We could just up 1mb to 2mb and get most miners on board.
Core is being just as stubborn as the miners.
Both major parties are culpable here; a 2mb block increase would not be a major increase on nodes, but would alleviate concerns of major centralization if LN is pushed through without an on chain block size increase.

I have and I believe there is a big danger of causing a chain split and alienating the group of people providing the security to bitcoin's chain.  I don't believe exchanges will pressure miners to accept it like people believe around here and I think we're going to end up with two chains; one without segwit but with the majority of miners,  the other with segwit but a much lower security.   If the balance is big enough,  there will be incentive for the miners to attack the UASF chain and kill it.   I doubt believe UASF will achieve 51% of miners by August first, which means even if they get exchanges in board there's going to be a reorg off of the legacy chain which will smash a lot of value into nothing instantly. 
I don't see a good outcome from this.

But it still allows governments to "freeze" transactions.  I'm *assuming*, of course, that most Lightning Network Hubs will be like most exchanges today; they will desire to comply with government decrees.  This becomes more true as Hubs increase in connectivity; it is better to comply for the sake of profits.
Sure, there will be other Lightning Nodes, but finding ones that don't comply with government requests will be difficult.
  &gt; Not to mention that it is possible to run an LN node on TOR, so it would also be difficult for a government to figure out where your LN node channeling to wikileaks is geographically.
The government has a large percentage of nodes on TOR.  It is possible using graph theory and owning a sufficient number of exit nodes to make very good guesstimates as to the sender and receiver for packets on the TOR network.
I'm just pointing out that LN isn't a magic decentralization spell.  It does have its own problems.

If you haven't picked up on it, your continued condescension has really put me off.


My position has been from the beginning that LN encourages off chain transactions.  Assuming growth, segwit will be quickly saturated (yes, more slowly than with 1mb blocks, I agree, it provides some breathing room for *segwit transactions*).  Without an on-chain expansion, and assuming growth in transactions remains linear, we will end up pricing most normal people out of the on-chain transactions.  The centralization of LN nodes without a subsequent block size increase is worrying for me as LN "hubs" becomes a point of censorship.

No, it's not very tame.  A hard fork allows assurances that you won't lose your transaction history at some time in the future.
With UASF, if you want to be assured you won't lose your transaction history, you have to upgrade.  That means a *lot* of people won't (either because of negligence, ignorance, what have you) and will end up getting fucked.

That's not necessarily true.  Can you quantify the number of transactions that weren't transacted because the fee was too large?  What percentage of people are going off chain or to other chains to transact because of fees?
Maximizing fees means balancing demand and price.  If you price something too high, you begin to destroy demand for it (and by "something" I mean on chain space, not bitcoin itself).

The quadratic hashing "bug" as I understand it is still present with 1mb blocks.  What is stopping it from happening now?


Replay protection is only necessary if the forks last for a long time.  That's why majority consensus is desired.  However, if you don't care about the other chain, then you don't need replay protection.  Unless the chain is contested, most people won't care about the small, ideological chain and will be oblivious to the problems they *could* encounter on the other chain.  And most people will just wait out the hard fork until it resolves, one way or the other.  Those things won't take *too* much time unless there's an ideological super-minority who doesn't mind losing lots of money.  


I don't believe replay attacks are a major concern.  Feel free to dispute this; I admit I'm not well versed in all the nuances of replay attacks.


This is *only* for the smaller chain, and encourages users to abandon the small chain quickly, as their transactions would be lost.  Again, not a major concern if we can achieve a safe majority.  What that majority is I'm not 100% sure, but I believe research has already been done on that and I'd be interested to hear what your take is on that.


As far as I know all of these are unnecessary except for the minority chain.


I'm not against segwit.  I can't wait for segwit.  However, segwit soft fork accrues technical debt in the form of backwards compatibility that we don't need if we can get traction on a hard fork.
I'm proposing the 2mb *simply* to get the miners onboard.

It's not as simple as *more bids*, but is *is* as simple as "more bids are  *increasing and matching asks*".
Edit: I missed this part first:  


Yes, absolutely correct.  My point was that for the price to move up, more bids have to move up (or be created higher) to match higher asks.  For the price to move down, more asks have to move down to meet lower bids.

Your post was condescending and "holier than thou".  When you speak like that, expect people to respond accordingly.
The whole conversation you linked was because you were arguing a different definition of "centralized".
When speaking of centralization in this sub, it is generally referring to the consolidation of mining.  This is *not* a problem as long as no actor has 51% of the mining capacity.  Indeed, Satoshi's white paper even envisioned that a bad actor *with 51%* would mine honestly as he would make more money.
This is the "centralized" I was referring to.  The "centralized" you're referring to is less ambiguously referred to as "trusted".  There are multiple parties involved in payment processing, so it is "decentralized" in the manner I was referring to above, however they are "centralized" in the manner *you* were referring to, above.  See how that misunderstanding was cleared up when it was identified?  
I completely agree that the double spend problem is solved in a "decentralized" (as in requires no single trusted third party).

Ok, fair enough.  I should have clarified.  I'm very much in favor of Segwit.


That's what I had heard was a major objection by miners.  I've actually just recently seen other arguments against UASF and in favor of a hard fork that swayed me more fully; if we hard fork segwit we don't have to carry the backwards compatibility requirement.  It's cleaner and more maintainable in the future.


This sentence was a little difficult for me to parse, but I want to clarify; I like Segwit.  I just think miner buy-in is important and don't see the "sky falling" with a 2mb hard fork (assuming we can get consensus in the community).
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:55:47


They have a nonce that unlocks their ability to create a block.  This gives them a very high chance of getting the block + fees as a reward.  There is a very low chance (although a chance) that their recently mined block will be orphaned.
By mining the block empty, they make the orphaned block scenario *even more unlikely* (and maybe something to do with Asicboost?  I'm not sure about that).  However, they lose their ability to lock in transaction fees *for that block* as well.
Your explanation does nothing to counter the fact that they have an opportunity cost when they mine an empty block.  As the block reward drops, this behavior will change since the fees will become more and more of the incentive to mine a block.

For now.  But if on chain transactions cost $20, who'll have $20 to open up a channel? 
Channels are also only good for multiple transactions between two parties, unless the other party has *other* channels open.  This makes the other party a hub, and increases his value as a participant because he can move more money to more people.  As this process continues, those parties become more and more like banks, where you pay to open a channel with your money and then can send it instantly to anyone that hub transacts with.
There is a distinct possibility that Lightning Network puts pressure to centralize.


Except the concern is the optimization, without the corresponding block size increase, will more quickly incentivize these hubs to develop and those hubs will have no interest in increasing the blocksize because it's the scarcity of the block size that encourages people to use said hubs.

I agree, but what's interesting is that hard forks are villified for causing a potential chain split (fork), but UASF supporters are find with a soft fork, which could cause a potential chain split (fork).
UASF has the additional danger of basically throwing away any history in the legacy chain if they gain adoption from miners *after the split*.  If UASF takes a while to overtake the legacy chain, the re-org will be massive and immensely damaging to those supporting the legacy chain.

It *does* matter.  Re-orgs are usually races between miners.  The incentive is to resolve them as *soon* as possible.
[Here's]( some perspective.
The longest re-org was because of a bitcoin overflow bug.  It lasted 53 blocks (or about 10 hours).
If the reorg because of UASF happens now and it is longer than a few blocks, it's going to disrupt the network and cause a lot of people a lot of problems.
You can tell me how much it will affect my investment or not, but this isn't about my investment, it's about maintaining a stable environment to transfer money.  UASF is *not* the way to do it looking at risk like this.
You can hand wave it all you want, but it is a poor decision.

for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.


sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

Either way, why is this such a dangerous topic that we dare not speak it's name?  When someone prohibits discussion, to me it indicates that their point doesn't rest on it's own laurels, and instead relies on censorship to remain relevant.
If this switch is terribly dangerous as you claim, it should be relatively easy to illustrate and, using logic, the idea would be shut down, no censorship needed.

No, you can't shift the blame to miners.  They haven't made any changes that will bring about potential catastrophe.  That's like saying "I've got a gun to your head.  If I shoot you, it's your fault because you didn't comply".   Most likely the gun won't even fire, but the act of pointing it shows a recklessness that is cringeworthy at best and malignant at worst.  It makes me think that there are other forces at play here and you are being manipulated.
Miners may not want to change, but *that's proof that bitcoin works*.  The monetary incentives are strong to keep the status quo (Satoshi's original paper theorized that even with 51% of the mining capacity, miners will rather keep things the same than try to modify the status quo).

It's taking *everyone* the same amount of time though.  The only problem is *if* you find a block *while validating*.  All miners are similarly affected.


Not it does not.  In this scenario, they will never include *any* transactions in the mined block because they can't know for sure if they are valid are not until the *entire* previous block is mined.  In fact, it's the opposite.  Miners have an incentive to include as many transactions as they can to inhibit *other miners*.  Since they've already validated their own block, they can start on the next block faster *and include fees* if they find it again.


But with demand as it is, they could set a higher fee.  Why aren't they leaving fees on the table as you insist they will at some point in the future?  Without demand to get included in the next block, fees will always tend towards zero.  The reason fees are high right now is because *blocks are full*.

It's not about the individual block size, but the propagation of blocks to other nodes.  If every nodes connected to you is completely caught up, and you have 8 connections, then you're potentially forwarding 8mb per 600 seconds, or 16.65 kb/sec up.  Sure, that's reasonable.  But that means you're transferring 1.37 gb/day.  That's 40gb a month with only 8 connections and all of them are caught up.
Then you factor in nodes that are *not* caught up downloading significantly more blocks per time, you're getting pretty saturated pretty quick.  40 GB a month is over some people's data limit and that's a conservative estimate.

How does your holdings convey anything about your expertise?

No.  Worst case is that the UASF wins, but it takes 2 or 3 weeks (or even longer) to do so.  Then the legacy chain ends up re-orging into the UASF chain and a good portion of the bitcoin community loses weeks worth of transactional history.
That's worse.

Technically it will cause a Soft Fork (hence the name UA**SF**).
Just being pedantic, a fork is a fork.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:43:17
Imagine for a moment the users at your bank came along and erased all your deposits and withdrawals, setting you back two weeks.  As an individual, this may not be too bad.
But as a business, you've already allocated that capital for purchasing new supplies.  You've used it for paying the salaries of your workers.  
If you can't understand that this is potentially catastrophic, then you don't really understand the nature of that which you propose.
It's ok though because it is increasingly apparent that BIP148 is not supported by the community and all the die-hards are just petulant children who don't have any patience.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:10:23

1. Effectively is not the same as actually.  
2. Like UASF, without support of the major exchanges, their hard fork will be dead in the water.  It's naive to think anyone can do so without buy in.
The fact that this proposal was announced shows that they need buyin.
UASF needs buy in too.  This whole "LOOK HOW MANY NODES ARE SIGNALLING NOW" is garbage; the **right** nodes have to signal.
Everyone needs to be in this together.  This "backdoor deals" thing is really trying to achieve consensus with the figureheads of powerful portions of the community.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:51:11
I'm going to try this one more time.  If you don't respond intelligently, without some stupid quip that adds nothing to the discussion, then you will effectively end it because this grows tiresome and I refuse to participate if we're just going to trade quips.
Bitcoin currently works as designed.  Fees are high, but that doesn't seem to slow a lot of people down.
Hard forks allow people to choose the fork they want to use; easy peasy.
This UASF has the potential to re-org the old chain, erasing people's transactions.
In the event of a re-org, I will blame the people who brought the change, namely those *implementing* (definition from google: *put (a decision, plan, agreement, etc.) into effect*) UASF.
Tell me again how I'm "clueless".  Why don't you call me a shill of some sort or tell me to "research it"?  Better yet, just type some onomatopoeia and see if *that* gets your point across.

No, you're right, blocksonly still forwards full blocks.  I was thinking of something different.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:27:43
I haven't seen many arguments against segwit because I haven't seen many people against segwit.  The arguments I see are that the current size of the blocks makes it feasible that soon the only way for the layperson to get transactions in a block will be to bundle with other people, presumably through third parties who will charge for the privilege.
If this is a distinct possibility, then adding extra on-chain space through a hard fork would mitigate that concern to a degree.  And everywhere I've seen, I've seen 2mb+segwit *hard fork* vs a segwit only *soft fork* (which carries the additional burden of requiring backwards compatibility).
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:09:07
Because without LN all transactions have to take place on-chain.  With LN transactions will be moved off-chain.

The byzantine general's problem is not solved by bitcoin.  It can never be "solved".  Bitcoin provides an *adequate approximation*.  And this is all in search of creating a token that users can be assured isn't replicated in a world where replication is costless.


Individually, yes.  They are "trusted" third parties.  They are not "centralized" because they don't all end up going through a single service.  Think about the word "centralized"; it means to have a single point.  These parties do not communicate with each other; they are not *centralized*.  They are merely *trusted* to keep their own internal ledger.


False; consensus is achieved in decentralized systems frequently.  For instance, nature does it all the time.  It's referred to as "equilibrium".


Yes it was.  Without bitcoin, any "digital cash" system required a trusted third party to keep the ledger.  With bitcoin, we now have scarcity in a world of copy paste.  [Here's]( a good article.


Those statements aren't incompatible.  Mining absolutely creates proof of work, which guarantees that tokens aren't spent multiple times, which guarantees scarcity.  The consensus part is necessary to guarantee "scarcity" (i.e. no duplication of the same token).


You're misunderstanding scarcity.  The scarcity being referred to here is the *individual token*.  Not the number of tokens.

No.  Miners can release blocks of any sort they want for *their chain*.
Nodes decide whether or not the blocks are valid for *their chain*.
These two groups are separate.  The miners publish a secure digital ledger, the nodes decide what ledger they'll accept.
Miners are also nodes.  Nodes are not miners.  Nodes can accept or reject blocks, but they can't *generate the history*.
If nodes don't like the format of the history, they can reject it.  But that won't stop miners.
If no one is mining blocks that match a node's idea of a block, it *does* stop the nodes.
Nodes do not have the same power that miners do.

This is bitfury supporting a floating blocksize?  That's more drastic than the 2mb proposal.


But as user adoption increases, we're going to see node cost increase as well.  Bitcoin is growing faster than Murphy's law can account for in node hardware.


That's unfair.  The handling of transaction volume isn't the only concern being debated.  Miners are aware that L2 scaling methods will handle current day volume, and are concerned that much of this volume will go off chain as the space in blocks becomes more and more utilized and in demand.  By offering a small amount of breathing room, we allow for on chain transactions to remain competitive with segwit short term.
Also, a soft fork segwit is messy.  A hard fork segwit is less messy as we don't need to worry about alternate serialization methods.  Adding a bump in the block size at the same time is easy at that point.
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:07:43
And you're cool with the old chain "disappearing" and erasing days or weeks of transactions people have made?  Lots of people will just not upgrade because they're not paying attention.

Reddit can sure be tiring sometimes.


So explain to me how a 51% attack works, numpty.


Only that the specific rules are followed, not that transactions actually occur.
Let's define consensus; it is two fold; A) That all the rules are followed and transactions/blocks are valid.  B) That the history is what we all agree it to be.
Nodes only provide (A).  Miners provide (A) and (B).  I've edited above to reflect that, but without miners, nodes would be circle-jerking that they all have valid code with no history to refer to, which means economic activity *stops*.


Satoshi referred to miners as "nodes" and non-miners as "client nodes".  He had a different definition than we use today.  


Hah!  Yes, exactly.


Sure enough.  But miners include them or don't.


Which creates consensus on history.

That incentive (for each person) amounts to a certain *value* proposition (value A).  The obtaining of a desired good or service also has a certain *value* proposition (value B).  When Value B &gt; value A, then spending happens.


That's an incredible assumption of a rate of deflation.  What happens if a year ago you could buy a car whereas this year you can only buy 1/2 a car?  That would impact the working class pretty hard.  Reductio ad absurdum hurts the inflationary argument as much as it does the deflationary argument.  Ideally you want a reasonably stable currency; a percent or two of inflation benefits big business and wealthy investors whereas a percent or two of deflation benefits the poor and middle class, while not being enough to discourage investment when the rate of return is 6 or 7%.

The same amount of time they'd take to earn that $500 in cash they're about to convert to Visa bucks.


Try to send money using Visa to Julian Assange, or anyone in Iran.  Good luck.  Obviously this isn't something that every citizen encounters regularly, but it is a drawback to Visa.


The accepting of the transaction is by *any* miner who finds a block.  No one person has control of who can transact.  That's kind of the point.


Yea, just like Visa bucks.  The only difference is, with Visa bucks, the *receiver* pays for the transaction, whereas with bitcoin, the *sender* pays.


$5 is 1% of $500, not 10%.


Nope, 1% fee at coinbase.


Someone, without a bank, who wants to order something for $10 online at a retailer who accepts Visa and bitcoin?  It doesn't seem like this particular hypothetical is less plausible than any other hypothetical we've discussed.  Make it $35, the amount you have to spend at Amazon to get free shipping.  If they took bitcoin, it'd cost you 1% through coinbase (.35) plus the $.05 transaction fee = $.40 for the transaction.  Amazon would convert to cash at say 1% (although I think bitpay does it for free), so the total cost would be $.75.
With the Visa bucks, you're looking at $3 for the card, plus 1.5% from Amazon for accepting Visa (that's a generous number, more likely 2% or even 3%), so you're looking at $3 + ($35*.015=$.53) or $3.53
Now, without a bank you couldn't use coinbase, so you'd have to resort to localbitcoins.  That may be up to a 10% markup, but 5% is probably more accurate.  At 10% you're comparable to Visa bucks, but 5% means Visa bucks have to be at $140 to be comparable (assuming $7 for larger transactions).

Blockchain doesn't require mining and can have permission and authority and still be a blockchain.  The term literally just means a chain of blocks.  Its just a data structure.  The real deal (by which I assume you mean bitcoin) just uses it in a way that allows everyone in earth to participate in a fruitless manner.  Changing the code to only allow certain participants or not require work to make the next block doesn't change the data structure *at all*.  It's silly to imply that it does.

They certainly did, but its not the same.  They don't lose out on the ability to sell oil when they refuse to sell oil; they retain the oil for future use.  When you release a block, you don't have the option to circle back around later to use that space, it is *gone*.


If you aren't a majority, you can move, but you won't make it very far.


Why?  If it has segwit baked in, why would it be so contentious?


You see them as options, but we have yet to ascertain whether or not they are actually options.

If the miner generates it, and all the miners accept it, then it goes forward without the nodes.
The nodes are now watching for blocks that never come.

UASF is most definitely an attack on miners; if successful it forces segwit in spite of opposition from their side.


Except a UASF, if successful, will re-org his chain.  Just because you aren't actively attacking doesn't mean you aren't threatening.  There's a very explicit threat from UASF; if we succeed, you get fucked.


51% attacks are just majority voting.  That's not really an "attack", it's the product working as designed.  Just as you said, he can run whatever code he wants, and if he wants to run code that fucks your chain, he can, just like UASF is *threatening* to do.  
If you can't see the parallels, you're being intentionally obtuse or you have no business continuing this conversation.


Running a UASF node is not simply buying a bad product.  It is explicitly designed to create new consensus rules where there isn't consensus.  Again, if you can't see that a 51% "attack" is the same thing as UASF then you are either woefully uninformed or intentionally trying to separate the two for the sake of divisiveness.

No doubt; I don't dispute their findings, just thought it was curious.


Yea I am not arguing for EC.


This is nonsensical though.  If there is empty space in a block, and there is a non-zero fee transaction that can fit within that space, it is trivial to include it to collect the fee.  If one miner doesn't, other miners will, which means that mining fees will always have a trend that approaches zero unless blocks start filling up.


No, they're competing with LN, which Segwit enables.


Right now off chain transactions require trust.  Yes, it is already happening, but there's nothing the miners can do about those transactions.  They may be able to do something about LN transactions.




Hard forks are definitely difficult to agree upon, so this is very handwavy.  Miners have expressed concern and asked for 2mb.  If there are no valid reasons against it, I can see one clear reason *for* it, and that's to get miners onboard.


That point in the future can be delayed though.  I'm talking about trying to fast track Segwit.


I don't think they are opposing Segwit indefinitely, just until they can receive their demands too.  And unless their demands can be shown to be faulty, I still cannot ascertain what's so bad about giving them 2mb blocks.


They definitely are doing this, so they're profiting from the stagnation.  All the more reason to find expedient ways forward.

I never changed my stance.   Maybe your reading comprehension needs work.  I've been very vocal that you WILL NOT have the longest chain without 51% of miners.   Without 51% THERE WILL BE A SPLIT. 
If majority of the economic power agree with you,  then the miners *may* be convinced to comply,  but that is not certain and if you don't have enough mining power they may just attack the uasf network.

Pre bubble was 122 just before the rise at the end of 2013.  Price dropped down to $177 in Jan 2014.  That's still not 60% of the top (at 1200, that'd be $720).

I'm not sure what you don't understand.


This is the 
    f(x) = BitcoinAddress
I was talking about.  The public key makes the address.  This address (as posited by OP) can't have a corresponding "x" which would be the public key.


Because it can't satisfy the f(x) = address equation, it can't have a public key and therefore no private key


Again, the f(x) = address thing; no "x" (public address) possible means no private address is possible


Seems self-explanatory; other addresses also have this same feature.

While technically true, it'll be evident pretty quick whether or not UASF has the support it needs.  If it doesn't, it may technically be able to overtake the legacy chain, but it'll be clear that it never will.
Technically, I could start bitcoin over with current consensus and it COULD reorg the current chain, if I get enough support.  That statement is meaningless though unless I can demonstrate I have the hashrate to accomplish it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:47:52


I'm all for that; 2mb isn't a large increase and I believe has been demonstrated to not be catastrophic to the network infrastructure.


Then why do we need bitcoin *at all*?  Either we need a settlement layer, or we don't.


No, it's not; it's that *less* transactions need to leave LN.  Movement between hubs still requires the back end.  LN still requires the blockchain for CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, which is what LN relies upon.


Hubs will settle large numbers of transactions simultaneously.  Those settlement costs will be distributed across transactions.


Either this is false, and there's some merit to miner's fears, or this is true, and there's no worry about a reduction of fees.  Pick one.

"Quick" is the operative word.
Lots of transactions are internal accounting, or consolidation, and can take place during off-peak hours.  Until almost all blocks are full, this isn't a major concern.  We may have to adjust our expectations a bit, but yesterday there were almost 150k unconfirmed transactions, and today we're down to 63k.  Over the course of the weekend I expect that to drop even further.
Remember how long distance phone calls were more expensive during the day?  Or when cell phone operators gave you "free nights and weekends"?  That was a product of a congested network.  However, we *need* some congestion to encourage fees or miners will eventually not have an incentive to mine.

I promise, businesses won't enter the space the same way.  They just don't take well to that kind of risk, especially since bitcoin is already risky.
I think you're underestimating how damaging a POW change against the will of the miners will be.


But these companies are funding R&amp;D too.  This isn't a static thing; it's dynamic and ongoing.

Of course not.  However, the political reason is sound; bitcoin is *highly resistant* to change.  If segwit goes in, expect to see a good deal of apathy regarding the block size increase until fees are considerably higher again.  
Trying to get multiple changes through when change is occurring is smart.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:22:22


That's false.  If they have a place to exchange their coins, 80% of nodes are irrelevant.  It's *the miners* that generate chains.


Ok Mr. Pot.  You speak to me of arrogance, and then in the next breath you arrogantly act as if you are an authority on the issue.  You aren't.  Unless 51% of miners agree, *there will be a split*.  If they end up agreeing because exchanges won't take their coins, **they're still agreeing**.  There is *no way to force the issue* if you don't have 51% of miners. 


You're making a lot of assumptions that are not based on anything.  You assume *it will be at a loss* like exchanges won't support both chains.  Seriously?  If you believe that then you are fucking stupid.  Exchanges don't give a fuck what the technical limitations of the coin are; they make money exchanging anything.


You are defeating your purpose here.  The point is to *convince people to support you*.  Calling people who are still conversing with you a dimwit is self defeating.  Without majority support you lose, and calling people names doesn't get you support.
So you can flail around on the floor and throw your tantrum if you want, but unless you get a majority of miners to support you, **you will split**.

I think the hope is that it will *decrease* the need for lawyers by *automatically* enforcing certain parts of the contract.
This won't negate the need for lawyers; if the automatic enforcement is itself a breach of the law in a given jurisdiction, for instance, there will still be legal recourse for recouping losses and such.
I think it's more about contract *enforcement* than anything else.  If I write an app that breaks the law, there will still be *people* involved to determine to what extent the law was broken and what actions need to be taken to rectify the situation.

Agreed, they are distinct steps, but miners *do* validate transactions before mining them into blocks, so to say that miners don't validate is untrue, pedantically.  To say that *the act of including transactions in a block is not the act of validation* would be pedantically true, but still irrelevant.  I'm not sure what it even implies...

Segwit bumps blocks to 4 mb.  How does that not pose the same problems you've just mentioned?


So you believe that a 2mb blocksize is *less* disastrous than invalidating millions of dollars in mining equipment *instantly* and starting over from scratch from a security standpoint?

Gold is "backed" by its chemical properties, which give it demand in industry.  It is inert and soft, making it a very useful metal for making jewelry.  It conducts electricity (although it's not the best, it's enough that it does) so, along with it's inert property, make it a good plating for electrical connections to prevent corrosion.
The idea of "backing" I believe is that it has a value other than its use as a medium of exchange.

1) And can be rejected if it originates from Tor correct?  LN hubs have the right to refuse service to anyone.
2) Sure, but that means I need a channel to reduce onchain fees below $100.  That means that when someone wants to use bitcoin, if they can't afford $100 for a LN channel, they have to use a third party, who can charge for the privilege.  Also, a LN channel can only send transactions back and forth between sender and receiver.  Only if LN node has channels to other payers can you spend between the two.  Now you're just simulating a bank but with less trust; the LN hub can still refuse to send your money anywhere.  They may not be able to take your money, but the can prevent you from using it just the same.

I'm not sure you should ever store your wealth in a government controlled currency.
In fact, one of the core targets of USD, for instance is an inflation rate of 2% which is specifically designed to get people to divest out of the dollar.
Large stores of wealth are held in commodities, company ownership, real estate, etc.
Edited to add: this is believed to be *good* for the economy.  The government wants their currency to be a unit of account, not a store of value.  They want to increase the velocity of money because there's a formula out there that states that MV = PY where M is the money supply, v is the velocity, P is overall price and Y is real GDP.
They believe that by increasing the velocity of money they'll increase the real GDP.
Of course, P could just go up instead (which is what we see in a situation like now where people don't want to grow their business because uncertainty),

Yes, what you say is correct.
But you are missing the idea that if BIP148 gets longer than the old chain, the old chain is lost *all the way back to the split*.  This isn't just some of the blocks, this is *all of the blocks*.  
I'm actually more scared of this scenario than any other scenario; UASF gets activated with a minority hashrate and splits.  People slowly move to the UASF chain until it surpasses legacy chain and reorgs the legacy chain into it.
It's not about who will win because I believe UASF will win out, Segwit being technically superior to no Segwit.  The problem is if it doesn't win decisively and quickly, anyone "not in the know" may lose days of transactional history.  Merchants on the legacy chain will have their money ripped out of their wallets after they've sold their goods.  Exchanges who didn't support UASF will lose deposits.  It's going to be a shitshow if UASF is not decisive.

2) Withdrawal of coins without additional trading is *devaluing* as I said.  If the market continues to value those coins for whatever reason, an exchange saying "we don't care" is telling its customers to fuck off.

Exactly.  The idea is that instead of generating one randomly, someone specifically picked one (it wasn't random).

The address is "technically" valid, but could not be the result of the mathematical equation that creates a bitcoin public key into a bitcoin address.

The bitcoineater address is like the number "1".  Sure, it's a number, but it won't ever satisfy this equation.
I don't know if this is true because this address is a base58 address, which means it *could* correspond to an output.  There may be a property of the hashing algorithm that means that certain patterns above would never actually manifest, for instance.

Yes, fundamentally so.
Proof Of Stake has two problems:
1) You're taking the direct route to "The Rich Control The System" instead of the less direct route that's taken through mining.
2) Nothing is at Stake.  In Proof Of Stake, "miners" don't lose anything by participating in multiple chains.  Thus the distinct possibility exists that multiple chains will co-exist.  With Proof of Work, there is the work at stake.  If you mine on one chain, you can't also simultaneously mine on another.  This means that forks are less likely to result in a clusterfuck of chains.

1) I was speaking of exchanges.  If users are doing it themselves, I'm not sure how that's relevant to the discussion about exchanges.
2) No, but exchanges don't like passing up money.  Gdax offers ethereum and litecoin because people want it and they make money off of trades.  Trezor just came out saying it would support both forks in its wallet.  It doesn't take much to support both since all the coding is basically identical.  If there is contention, I surmise that most exchanges will expand to offer both just to make the extra dough; not because I'm entitled to it.  I'm not sure where you even got that presumption.

I'll not continue to repeat myself.  You can postulate how that $100 will be covered, but in the end it doesn't matter; on-chain transactions will be priced out of reach of individuals with LN+1mb.

Kind of.  M of N means that you need M keys out of a list of N possible keys to send bitcoin.  So basically you can have a number of people with keys in the "possible" list and a subset of those keys can spend bitcoin.  A good example of a use case would be an organization where 10 people have the authority to authorize a payment but at least 2 need to authorize it.  That would be a 2 of 10 multi-sig.

My elevator pitch:
Before bitcoin, the only way to do business online was through a bank.  You literally *had* to have a bank.  To send money online Bitcoin eliminates this *need*.  It's the first real, actual *cash* for the internet.  Currently, most people still transfer into and out of banks, but it's not *required* any longer.  I can get paid in bitcoin and buy stuff online and never touch a bank.
This solves a few problems:
1) Unbanked and third world countries have a hard time participating in the internet economy.  Internet cash makes that easier, and as adoption increases banks become less necessary allowing, for instance, free trade tea to be sold at more competitive prices directly from the manufacturer.
2) International remittance is as easy as domestic remittance.  Lots of online businesses (web developers are a good for instance) can now operate cross-border with much less friction.

It's the UASF people who don't understand economics.  Businesses are *risk averse*.  UASF is a big risk.  They won't do it if it isn't a sure thing, so most economic nodes will follow the hashrate.


Except segwit2x *includes* the multi layer scaling you want.

That's not correct.  They aren't the ones going; the UASF people are the ones going.  They'll just make sure UASF doesn't fuck them while they go.


Ugh.  This is so ingrained here it is ridiculous.  Nodes will continue to rise in cost as the network grows.  That *will* happen.  Expensive transactions just means that people will use other coins more or rely on off-chain solutions (which will also decrease decentralization).
Bitcoin will remain decentralized as long as it has widespread world-wide usage.  Adding a few megs to the block size may knock some nodes off, but as usage grows new nodes will be added; nodes with greater economic sway.

Talking about "fuck ceos" is bullshit; many of the businesses that are the target of this attitude have done immeasurable good for the bitcoin community and I'm sorry if it bothers me how people are acting like SegWit is God's gift to bitcoin and anyone whose willing to support a hard fork to get miners onboard are charlatans and hoodlums trying to force a "poison pill" down people's throats.

Money is just the collective acceptance of a given commodity being worthy of trade.  So if a commodity is viewed as precious by a large number of people, that makes it better for use in trade.  That's where money usually starts; a commodity that's easily traded and easily assessed for value (weight, purity, etc).  
Not saying you're wrong, but just pointing out that the "illusion" is actually a precursor to people using it as money.  Either that or as a remnant from when it *was* money.

Moving perception is not the ultimate goal here.  It is "forcing" miners to accept a change they may not want.  If you don't have major exchanges onboard, there's no pressure for miners to switch.

@_date: 2017-07-19 23:20:55


I did.  This was from my first post: 


That's my concern; smaller block sizes (and continuous adoption/growth) leads to situations where transactions are so expensive that settlement will only be affordable with third party aggregators or as part of opening/closing channels with large hubs (think "OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH US AND WE'LL PAY YOUR SETTLEMENT COSTS").


Do you have empirical data on that?  Because I'm not sure that it does centralize mining even more (mining is pretty "specialized" already).


If nothing else changes.  I mentioned the FIBRE network and the xthinblocks technology.  This could very well help with propagation time, which seems to be the first major hurdle.  Verifying blocks should be considered as an issue, so a modest increase to keep up with increasing computational power shouldn't be an issue.  Quadratic hashing should be resolved by segwit (I believe) so the verification process should stay linear (IIRC). 


No doubt.  But *because* it is hard, developers will (and should) strive to fit as many improvements as they can in per change, since there's a low likelihood of another change occuring soon.  When my company pushes to production, we try to get as many bug fixes/features in as we can, so that they'll be live longer and benefit the company more.  I understand that this should mean "tested" bug fixes/features, and that there's contention about testing the activation methods and such of the segwit2x code base, but in reality there aren't a lot of changes and we have three months for those changes to be vetted (on which the vetting has already begun).


Doesn't *require* larger block sizes, *facilitates* larger block sizes.  One major concern of larger blocks is propagation time.  And while I haven't dug deeply into it yet (seriously, can the cryptocurrency space just slow down for a fucking second so I can catch up even a little?!), cursory reading implies that both of these technologies make propagation times less of a concern for larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:25:11
If double the blocks is not scalable long term, neither is 1.7x.  Additional things need to happen (like the Lightning Network).  Making changes to bitcoin is *hard*, so it makes sense to try to ensure that future concerns are mitigated as soon as possible; it may be *even harder* to change in the future.  And if LN becomes a thing without any additional space on the blockchain, on chain transactions will become more and more expensive.


Mining pool operators have an acute understanding of the economic incentives they are using to drive their business.  Software engineers very rarely have any idea of business acumen.  Being one myself, I can tell you that there's a reason that business analysts exist.

Comparing a single webpage download isn't really a good comparison though.

In real terms or relative terms?  Because if the whole crypto-space is growing, Bitcoin's price grows too.


I'm saying that while this is technically true, it doesn't necessarily detract from the value of Bitcoin.  Think about the fact that other countries print their own dollars.  Does that dilute the value of the USD?  


But that would hold true for *literally* any commodity right?  Like, when people come up with new shit, does that also dilute the value of bitcoin?  Shakeweights dilute the value of bitcoin?  I mean, I have to choose between a Shakeweight and Bitcoin, right?


Who we?  It isn't detracting from your USD value.


How is this different than Amazon stock, or any other company?


How can you even assume this is possible?  People want fiat dollars, so they trade bitcoin for them.  You can't "not give it a fiat value", because everyone is allowed to do their own thing.

I think "severely confused" is a bit over the top.  The word "centralized-ledger" is using "centralized" in a different way than was being used previously.  When I say "trusted", I'm referring to this same ledger keeping.
Decentralization is most definitely the solution to double-spending tokens *without trust*.  This is mostly pedantics at this point, but even in a *centralized-ledger* paradigm, you can't prevent the ledger keeper from colluding with others to double spend.  So no, it isn't *trivially prevented* in a *centralized-ledger* paradigm.


Double-spending without trust, most definitely it is.

You keep using that word like a sword but you fail to qualify how it is being misused.  Decentralization means no one entity making decisions.  As long as sufficient nodes exist in multiple jurisdictions it will be decentralized.  Do you know the limit at which it stops being decentralized?  How many nodes?  How cheap must it be for large businesses across the world to continue to run them?
 Please enlighten us all, oh Oracle.  


The size of the blockchain only grows.  If Moore's law is dead, then the cost of a node will not become cheaper over time.  The idea of keeping the monetary policy the same has *no* bearing on the cost of the node.  lol.  You talk about understanding but mix so many concepts it's dizzying.

It's funny because you don't even seem to comprehend that [empty blocks are not necessary for covert asicboost](
On a segwit chain, covert asicboost is still possible as long as the miner ignores segwit transactions.
Edit: Also, if empty blocks are so suspicious, they could create transactions ahead of time to include to remove suspicion.  Thinking you've found some kind of smoking gun is naive.

If you're coins are in cold storage or a wallet where you control the keys, there's no problem.
If you are on an exchange with your coin, there's a problem.
If you are a long term HODLER who doesn't care about the price short term, there's no problem.
If you care about the price short term, there *may* be a problem.
If you don't care about your BCC, there's no problem.
If you care about your BCC, you should pay attention because as soon as the fork happens, when you spend your B**T**C, the receiver could replay your transaction on the B**C**C network and get both your coins.  This is known as a replay attack.

Not easily measurable but the distinction is extremely important.   Exchanges and wallet providers service a large number of people.  The rules they enforce are the rules that a large portion of the economy will follow. 
Think about it.  If I spin up 1000000 nodes that no one uses and all enforce BIP148 but the one node coinbase uses does not enforce BIP148, then is BIP148 likely to be enforced?  Of course not.

One could (with similar quantities of evidence) accuse Blockstream of spamming the network to convince people to put Segwit into play.


For anyone else who isn't pushing an agenda and is actually willing to listen, look at the timestamps on Antpool's empty blocks.
They're usually seconds from the previous one.  Antpool mines an empty block if it finds a hash on top of the previous block *before it validates all the transactions*.  If it finds a nonce before it has finished validating, it makes sense to publish empty instead of risk publishing an invalid block.

Except it becomes expensive to open LN channels.  If it is expensive to do so, who will be doing most of the opening/closing of channels?  Probably businesses.  It'll make more sense to open with businesses with large channel counts because you're more likely to find a route to a payee you wish to transact with.  There will probably be companies who specialize in opening channels and maintaining large channel counts just to facilitate these types of transactions.
Of course, businesses have to abide by KYC/AML laws if they're forwarding money.  And now the expedient way to do business is synonymous with doing business with the current banking industry.  Censorship resistance becomes much more expensive.

Of course not; we need to reach equilibrium.  That will happen as middle classes develop in these other countries.

This makes labor more expensive than previously and causes demand to gradually return as they labor forces reach equilibrium of price.

Ok, so there seems to be a misunderstanding here.  There are two ways to view the word "centralized".
Typically in this sub, it is meant to describe the direction bitcoin is moving vis a vi miners; with less and less miners performing more and more of the mining.  This is what I interpreted the OP of this whole weird discussion to be referring to.
Centralized can also be referring to a trusted third party who completely takes the place of bitcoin.  In this definition, I refer to them as "trusted" third parties.
The entire point of bitcoin is to generate digital scarcity without trust.

The point of decentralization and the cost of decentralization are separate issues.  If you can't see that then you don't understand basic economics.


You're right, there is a level of decentralization here.  It is definitely less centralized than a king, *which was the whole point*.  They wanted to decentralize power.  They did a decent job.  The US government is MOST DEFINITELY not a single actor.  There are a number of players at a number of levels and only people who live in their parents' basements railing at *the man* think that the government's power is somehow a single central entity.
Even banks aren't centralized.  The US has central banks and Automated Clearing Houses but somehow ISIS still is able to move money around in this digital age.  That's because there is not one single world entity controlling every transaction.  In *the US*, banks and payment processors have to adhere to certain rules, but even those differ between states.  
The decentralization that bitcoin brings is not the core value.  It is a means to an end, which is *trustlessness* and *permissionlessness*.  
You are the one who seems to miss the point of bitcoin, my friend.

We don't have to sit and wait, we can see it happening.  We can also price the externalities more appropriately; I'm all for import taxes based on environment standards, for instance.  But that's nothing to do with the upper class being wealthy.  Again, that's a red herring.


You're going off on a tangent.  China *is* figuring it out.  In fact, they're on track to produce more solar power than the US; they're actually solving problems.


Automation has been happening for hundreds of years.  Cars, telephones, the internet; luddites have been claiming since forever that technological advances are somehow harmful to humanity.  We'll see.

All else being *absolutely* equal,  yes.  But again,  there are confounding variables to your relationship that I believe you fail to consider. 


No,  this was never the intent.   Look at the original whitepaper where Satosbi refers to datacenters being the predominant nodes and most people using spv wallets.  
All you need is to keep 51% out of the hands of a single actor.  And *even then* the incentives to play nice (as surmised in the whitepaper) should be such to entice the majority hashrate to continue in the chain as opposed to attacking it.


Again you ignore the decentralizing force of increased adoption. 


Agreed,  but miners have incentives to specialize and as such more expensive nodes become simply a capital expense.

If the premise that

The node doesn't confirm it before building on top of it, but the block still adds to the chain length assuming the previous block is valid, so an attacker would still have to create a chain longer than the one with the empty block on the end.
Additional confirmation on top of the empty block (with the previous 2 blocks validated) now has 2 validated confirmations where before there was only one.
Since the threshold for impractical attack is 6 blocks, an empty block *does* contribute to the security of the network.

But *some* people enjoy the liquidity of gold without requiring the ETF-esque properties.  It's *nice* having a commodity with a fixed supply that I can "keep under my mattress" but still liquidate instantly from home.  To dismiss this is because you personally don't need it is ignorant.


You mean kind of like the physical world already has with every single physical good?  Exactly.  I can trade physical goods without censorship if I wish because I don't need a third party.  Bitcoin provides that too, which enables true ownership in a digital world where ownership was previously only possible with federated entities.


I'll do as I please, thank you.


But they can't take advantage of the benefits of digitalization.  


Yea, basically.  So?

Having a store of value that is transferable anywhere on earth in an hour is a pretty fantastic thing.  We're talking about the *properties* of gold that make it desirable: it can't be replicated,  it is fungible, it has a relatively fixed supply and it is easily divisible and re-combinable.

What we are seeing is neither.
This is *speculation*, which is *even worse*.
A small amount of inflation, just like a small amount of inflation, doesn't have a major effect on a currency to the normal user.  As long as it is basically the same yesterday as it was today normal people won't really feel either one.
Larger institutions will definitely want to get out of an inflationary currency in favor of investments with a stronger return.
It would be nice though for normal people who can't afford more than $5 or $10 a week to save could have an investment vehicle that was easy to obtain and slowly rose in value.
USD inflates to encourage commerce.  Bitcoin is (or can be, if volatility is ever reduced) the savings vehicle for the people.

It's not something special, but the point is that you don't specify the address when generating bitcoin public/private key pairs; it's a one-way function.
If you could go the other way then bitcoin would be broken.
So if a public address is apparently created without the corresponding private key, it's an "eater" address because we can be relatively certain that no one generated the address through the normal route and instead picked an address arbitrarily.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:06:03


No, but that's not the point.  The point is to reduce the competitive edge of LN so that miners can continue collecting on chain fees.  If blocks remain constrained at 1mb, it will continue to drive people out of the actual chain until most normal people can't afford more than one or two commits to the chain a year.  By adding room to the chain, it leaves on-chain solutions cheaper for longer, theoretically keeping miners from losing out.

The disagreement on Segwit is that it needs to occur with a larger block size.  Segwit enables LN and if LN is deployed without a blocksize increase, there are two valid concerns;
1) Short term fees will drop as people use LN and decrease the number of transactions on chain.
2) Fees will rise, and eventually price people out of on chain transactions.  This will cause centralization by encouraging LN hub usage.
Both of these fears can be mitigated with a larger blocksize.
It is my understanding also that Segwit destroys covert Asicboost.  So what exactly do they gain from 2mb+segwit if it destroys covert Asicboost (and thus the talking point)?
Segwit WITHOUT a block size increase makes the Blockstream technical solutions more appealing.  Whether or not their intentions are pure is not the discussion; they most definitely benefit from keeping the block size small.

Mining only sets the criteria for *how* the blocks are chained together.  What matters is that there is a logical grouping of blocks, with a function that irreversibly connects blocks in chronological order.  If there are blocks, and there is a link that relies on some contents from a previous block, you have a chain of blocks.
I don't disagree that this isn't the *optimal* solution, but mining doesn't create blocks, it just creates a difficulty threshold for HOW those blocks are chained together.  Mining is the *method* of chaining, not the *blocks*.

If 51% of miners or more disagree, there will be a split.  If *the markets* prefer a SegWit chain, they *may* be able to persuade miners to adopt it.  However, the more likely scenario is exchanges will just support both chains, and make money either way.
If UASF gets 51% of miners, they win because their chain is a soft fork, and will pull miners into it because it'll be the longest chain as it technically satisfies the consensus rules on both sides.

What secures the network is the amount of work done on the longest chain, creating *consensus*.  You only need *one* node with the longest chain.  It is not falsifiable.  The amount of decentralization is not relevant.
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:13:55
I feel like people misunderstand LN.
LN won't work like Visa.  I don't have to lock up all my funds to use Visa.  My funds are available on demand.  With LN I have to commit my funds to the channel in order to use them.  To get them back I have to pay the fee to settle the chain.
That's not ideal until literally everyone has a payment channel open to them.  And even then, you don't "add" to the channel, you have to create new channels if you want to add more money.
Notice that LN requires lots more on-chain transactions than people think.
If you don't expand the size of the blocks, those LN channel openings/closings become *expensive* (assuming consistent growth which I believe we are all comfortable assuming).
Why expensive nodes lead to centralization but expensive transactions don't is an exercise in mental gymnastics.  In fact, most people *already* don't run a node and somehow they get to use bitcoin just fine.  But if transactions are expensive most people won't be able to afford on-chain transactions (even to open LN channels).  
Your solution is good short term but *cannot* work long term without an expansion of the network.  Otherwise you get the same "bank coin" scenario, just with corporations controlling the LN hubs instead of the nodes.  And when changes are being made, it's not a bad idea to include multiple aspects of the same solution; changing bitcoin is *hard* and when an opportunity arises to make a change you have to take it.  Bigger blocks will *eventually* (like in a few years) be a necessity, so opposition to doing it now is more of a control thing than a technical thing.

Ideally we keep increasing as technology allows.


I gave you one and you completely ignored it.  On chain transactions must remain cheap or centralization of transacting occurs.


Segwit *does* provide an increase in capacity.  Great.  But it doesn't affect propagation or node count the same way.  Therefore there's room for more.
The idea is to *maximize* utility.  If we could add 32mb blocks without drawback, why wouldn't we?  What do you have against more space?
Additionally, adding changes to bitcoin is *hard* (haven't you seen?).  If we don't include this now, there's a good chance we won't be able to for *years*.  It doesn't make sense *not* to; the effects are minimal (when xthinblocks and FIBRE network are considered) and the throughput is greatly increased.

False on both counts.  Nodes validate blocks too; they'll reject a block that doesn't fit the consensus rules.  This is how UASF plans to fork; rejecting blocks that aren't signalling.
And the reason no incentive is given for running a node is because there is no way to prevent the system from being gamed; I could run a thousand nodes from a single AWS server that would not provide any additional support to the network and get all those monies.

No, miners often mine empty blocks because they have found another block on top of the previous one before the previous one could be validated and this is only to prevent them from including an invalid transaction which would invalidate their block.
Once the previous block has been validated, any found blocks will cram in as many transactions as they can.


Then why are all blocks full *now*?  Hmm?  Why aren't we seeing miners jack up their fees in the presence of *obvious* demand?


And the mempool didn't have a constant backlog over 1mb either...
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:22:13


No I'm not.  I'll clarify.


You are absolutely right, however that is *not hazardous* if everyone abandons the old chain since there is no chain split, so that doesn't invalidate my original claim.  A hard fork just changes consensus in a way that previous consensus is broken.  If the vast majority of people abandon the previous consensus in favor of the new consensus, it is *not* hazardous.
It is *potentially* hazardous, but if everyone sees that compromise means giving some and getting some, then it doesn't *have* to be hazardous.  
That's why my claim is that a HF is only hazardous if it doesn't have majority support.
If you want to argue semantics of the word "majority", that is your prerogative, but I'll try to head it off by clarifying to "vast" majority.

Which everyone agrees upon.


We require an expansion of space on-chain for these non-linear solutions to remain affordable.  If you do not, these non-linear solutions will become very expensive.  As you suggest with nodes, expense encourages centralization, and so shall it be with transactions.


No, it allows on-chain transactions to remain affordable near term.


The agreement is that both will be implemented.  Railing against that is counter-productive since supporting both is more likely to result in implementation.  We *will* need on-chain space to keep bitcoin affordable for users.  We *will* need scaling solutions besides expansion of on-chain space to support increased usage.  Both are necessary.

Who said anything about getting rid of them?  You seem very certain about an outcome that is far from settled.  Increased adoption encourages more nodes.  Tell me, have you statistically normalized for all the potential variables and determined exactly how many nodes will get knocked off by a given increase in block size?  If you haven't, then you should stop asserting facts that aren't facts at all but baseless assertions based on a few memes in a reddit subforum.

Except for the fee for the transaction, to which I was originally referring.


Unless you can prove that all transactions will be "non-custodial", businesses won't *even open the channel* with you because you *may* be sending them funds to which they will be the custodian.  Are you prepared to make this argument against the SEC?  Because most businesses are *not*.


I never argued against this.


And those nodes won't have pathways to legitimate businesses in your jurisdiction; users may be able to avoid nodes with identification requirements but businesses won't.  Try paying for your coffee through a Russian node; you think that's plausible in an environment of government oversight?

See, you keep repeating this same mantra (which is a propaganda technique: if we say the same thing enough people will believe it).
Without on chain space improvements, we'll see similar centralization.  I've repeated this to you more than once and you haven't listened.  If block space is too expensive, only large corporations will be able to open LN channels (assuming Segwit without 2mb blocks).

increased hash rate means it becomes harder to "fake".  In order to change the history, you have to re-organize the chain from the block you want to remove.  You then need to build an alternate chain longer than the original chain.
If you have more than 51% of the network's hashrate, you can theoretically win from any position on the chain.  The farther back you want to go to change it, the longer it will take you, but you will eventually win because you can consistently find blocks at a greater rate than the rest of the network.
The higher the hashrate, the more expensive it is to beat the honest network.

Your kilo weight lifting analogy doesn't work here because there's no proof of work. POW is not "just" the work, it's also the mathematical evidence that the work was performed (the proof part).
Coupled with digital signatures (which can be mathematically verified and also cannot be falsified) you have evidence of a transactional history.

This is where I no longer follow your logic.  The proposition that we increase block size does not necessitate that security be degraded.  It's not a binary thing; 1mb is not some magic number that guarantees X nodes.  Node count is affected by a large number of variables; the legality of bitcoin in a jurisdiction, the availability of high speed internet, the cost of hardware and bandwidth as well as the network effect of bitcoin itself.
Unless you've somehow normalized for all these variables, it is difficult to conclusively say "X increase creates Y decrease in node count".  Increased usage *will* increase node count as more people have a vested interest in verifying transactions.  Additionally, pruning nodes minimize the effect on storage and make bandwidth the primary bottleneck.

Make transactions expensive enough and only the rich or businesses will be able to use the on-chain capabilities.  Everyone else will have to use off-chain solutions that *will* require full AML/KYC compliance.
The lightning network, if it doesn't have relatively cheap on-chain transactions, will create hubs that make lots of connections.  These hubs will be the only way most businesses will accept bitcoin, and those hubs will be KYC/AML compliant.

Congratulations; thanks for your anecdotal evidence.  If we must depend on the generosity of people worldwide then bitcoin is already dead.  Running a node should include *an incentive*; censorship resistance is one, but another good one is immediate validation; increased adoption *will* encourage more people with vested interests to run nodes, and they have far more resources than you.


Regularly != constantly, and I'm suggesting that it is *already happening*.


And most nodes are not run by those people.  Look at heat maps of nodes; they're predominantly in first world, rich countries, with most nodes running in the eastern US.  If you want 3rd world countries to run nodes, they need a reason, and one reason is *massive adoption*.


False dichotomy.


That's not happening now; do you have evidence of censorship?


Your node will continue to work for the near future; it is hyperbole to suggest that blocks will immediately be full all the time and that nodes will immediately be knocked off the network.

There are miners willing to create "spam" transactions that are submitted without a fee just to satisfy the requirements.

@_date: 2017-07-09 19:47:04


No, because that is what we're banking on.  The incentives in bitcoin are supposed to be aligned to take advantage of greed, not require its absence.
They want *more* fees.  As such, most miners will decide on which transactions to include that will maximize their fees.  Higher capacity *may* maximize their fees.  If they can include 1800 transactions in a block or 3600 (assuming the same fees) then they'll make more money.

False, miners definitely verify transactions.  You should *also* verify, but miners are not taking the chance that their block be rejected, so they will *definitely* validate.
In fact, that's why you see empty blocks sometimes on the heels of another mined block.  If a miner sees a new block, they'll have two processes running; one process immediately begins mining on the new block and another process validates the new block.  If they mine *another* block before they can finish validating the just received block, they'll release it empty since they haven't had a chance to validate the previous transactions, which means they could be including invalid transactions into their new block.

Yes, this would *slow* the process of ASIC centralization.  But if Bitcoin is worth it, then people will build ASICs for all 100 algorithms and switch to the proper chip as needed.
If bitcoin continues to be valuable, people will specialize and do mining as efficiently as they can, which will be more efficient than your PC.  Always.


So I'm not sure why we're discussing it.  I don't care about BU *at all*.


In a test environment.  Anyone who does software knows that a go-live can be expected to find unforeseen issues.  Not saying that's the case here, but it can't be deemed "safe" until it is rolled out.


So why isn't this a bigger push?  A 2mb increase will get miners on board.  Let's test it and see what happens.

You could register more than one address though.  And since anyone in any jurisdiction could register an address, forcing companies to only accept payment from verified addresses means either all governments have to cooperate (and we've seen how successful that is) or international payments are banned.  Can you envision either scenario playing out in the government's favor?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:25:25


I don't believe that this is the danger.  If so, why are miners pushing for bigger blocks?  The danger (which I believe is low for 2mb, but gets larger as the blocksize grow) is *propagation* and *validation* times.  If it takes a long time to propagate because of size, miners closer will have an edge.  This encourages geographical centralization.  If it takes a long time to validate because of size, larger miners will have an edge which increases centralization based on size.   I believe the propagation threat is the larger threat and that there are mitigation techniques (the use of FIBRE and xthinblocks appears to address this, but I haven't read much on the topic).

The reason "economic support" matters is because the nodes put pressure on people using them.
Exchanges are using a node for *a lot* of activity.  If miners can't get a transaction to register on the exchange's node, they'll have an incentive to switch to the chain that that node recognizes.
Wallets pointed at external servers (like Mycelium) are using a node for *a lot* of activity.  If users can't transact with their bitcoin over these nodes, they'll switch to the chain that that node recognizes.
If no one is using your node, then all you are doing is saying "I like BIP148" and you aren't exerting any pressure on the people whose actions actually determine whether or not a UASF gains traction.

2) You will receive your BTC; that's not the issue.  The issue is that when you put bitcoin on an exchange, you are really trading your bitcoin for an IOU.  That IOU does not split into BCC when the fork happens.  The bitcoin splits.  You've given your bitcoin to the exchange and they've "credited" your account.
When the fork happens, BTC will have a clone BCC.  Anyone holding the private keys will immediately have BCC automatically.  If you don't have the private keys, you won't get BCC.  The exchange will still have your BTC IOUs in their account (assuming they are a reputable exchange) but some won't credit you with the BCCs you would have received if you had the private keys.

You're right, and I hadn't considered that.  However, it should be easy to determine if we can find which miners mined the blocks that those transactions occured in.
If they are found solely in blocks known to be mined by a specific group, I'd say that's pretty strong evidence that they are private.  If they are found throughout the ecosystem, then they were most likely released to the mempool.
Of course, another thing to consider is that if they were private, then they wouldn't have had their (allegedly) intended effect of filling up the mempool, because they would not have been broadcast.

So what is the fee if only one transaction is mined?  Without a subsidy it will cost more to send when traffic is low, since there are less transactions (assuming non full blocks).  How do you accurately predict mining fees when they are dependent on volume?  Will most miners just shut down on weekends?  
It seems to me that full blocks give higher certainty to all parties.  Without full blocks *or* a subsidy, you've introduced more risk in an already risky endeavor (mining) and made it more difficult for users to feel confident in their transaction times.  It seems less than ideal and likely to stifle growth.

Your tone was definitely condescending.  And considering that *I do* know what I'm talking about, your attitude and behavior have been deplorable, especially the sub post about me being "clueless".  You can frame me as the bad guy all you want, but the truth is, bitcoin is only awesome because it makes a digital commodity where before there was no such thing.  Decentralization as you refer to it is a means to an end, not the end in and of itself.
Bitcoin's true awe-inspiring property is that it creates a digital asset that cannot be replicated, mimicking the idea of physical scarcity.  Decentralization is a means, not an end.  Centralized payment methods are wildly successful and only a few people actually need to do transactions without submitting to identity verification processes.  Paypal doesn't care who you are, and in 99% of cases works phenomenally well.  
Scarcity (not the supply limit, the individual tokens) is what makes bitcoin so amazing, not decentralization.  Decentralization *accomplishes* this goal but *most people don't care about that*.


See, there's that condescension again.  It's not disguised as concerned helpfulness this time though, so maybe others can see it for what it is.
Or not, I don't care.

Segwit still employs the blockchain for its transaction.  Bigger blocks means more room, less competition.  Fee trends towards zero when there's no congestion, and upwards to infinity as usage grows (assuming a static blocksize).


You wouldn't.  But that's the point.  If you have no empirical evidence then it is conjecture.  There have been simulations by bitfury that showed that (2 years ago) barring any advances (like FIBRE and/or xthinblocks) that 90% of the nodes would be knocked off the network at 4mb.  However, there was a Cornell study that also said that network decentralization would be maintained at 4mb or less.  So we don't have a lot of data either way and just magically saying "OF COURSE THAT WILL HAPPEN" is unfair from a data standpoint.


Emergent consensus is allowing blocks to dynamically grow and shrink based on miner signaling.  That's not the same thing at all.  I'd agree that we shouldn't just hand the miners complete control of the block size; that allows larger miners to knock out smaller competition.


No, it hurts verification, hence it should be considered as a reason to be wary of big blocks.  


The more costly the settlement layer, the more users are forced off-chain.  At a certain point, the blockchain would only be for big businesses to use for settlement.  Small guys might be able to *run* a node but they won't be able to *use* it, and I don't see how that's a satisfying trade-off.  We definitely need off-chain solutions.  My concern is the cost of the on-chain transactions.  Just as with block size, fee size should also bee seen as a centralizing pressure.


And that goes back to the concept of the difficulty of code change.  If we get LN and things start going great, are we in for another 3 years of squabbling for a 1mb increase in blocksize?

I think the call is unreasonably constraining to our government; being able to print money to encourage desired outcomes is a power most governments won't give up once they've been given it, and for the most part I believe rightly so.  Watching Greece get pummeled with no tools to incentivize exports made me grasp that being able to inflate your currency can be a good thing for your country.
Instead, using a voluntary non-inflationary currency allows people to park small sums in an inflation-protected asset.  Precious metals give us that but they have large drawbacks, like difficult divisibility, cost of transportation, ease of counterfeit, etc.

One of the aspects of Keynesianism that I actually like is the concept of spending during downturns.  I'm not a big fan of taxation, but if you're going to do it, you should get the most bang for your buck.  It's the same way my family operates.  We time our purchases so coupons and discounts make products significantly cheaper than retail price, and then buy *a lot*.  That way, during the times when the products are at full price, we have no need of them.
This is similar to how Keynesians want to use government tax revenue.  When the economy turns down, that means that prices for infrastructure drop.  Labor is cheaper, goods are cheaper and the government can get a good deal on things like roads and bridges, employees, etc.  A side effect of this is that there is some stimulation of the economy (which may be the main desired effect).  
The problem comes during the boom times.  When business is booming and tax revenue is flooding in, that's the time for the government to tighten its purse strings and save up for the next down turn.  Of course, YOU tell a populous who controls your periodic review (aka election) that you aren't going to dole out that money to them and see how far it gets you.
So our big problem is that our government doesn't reign in its spending during times of surplus, and so when the downturn happens, those whose primary goal is to stimulate the economy shout "We have to spend MORE!", which, if your only goal is to stimulate the economy, is probably right.  But by increasing your deficit, you make it *even harder* to save next time, making the problem worse.
True Keynesianism advocates saving money SOMETIMES, which we never seem to be able to do when push comes to shove.

While A chain split != a hardfork, why do you think they are different enough to warrant a distinction?
Chain splits that happen all the time are due to timing issues and have never been more than a few blocks in length.  Most are a single block.  UASF has the potential to introduce a *much longer* chain split that could wipe out days or weeks of transactional data.  
Hard forks are not the boogie man.  In fact, hard forks can be seen as "opt-in" whereas soft forks require action to opt out.

Segwit very much does scale by a factor of 2x (on chain transactions).  This *will* have an effect on nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:29:11
I was specific in my wording.
If blocks aren't full there will be zero fee transactions, but the average will be above zero.  However, the longer blocks aren't full the closer the asymptote will approach zero.
All this talk about miners setting a certain size fee is nonsense.  If they have room to include another transaction for a greater than zero fee, they will.

Technically yes, functionally not really.
The full 21 million bitcoins have not been created yet.  Technically, it inflates currently at a rate of 12.5 btc per block, which drops by half about every ~~2 years~~ 4 years.  Eventually, this halving will cause the inflation to approach zero, until some time in the 2100's when it will eventaully shut off.  At that point inflation will end.
The inflationary aspect can be thought of as a really a well-designed distribution method instead, with a total supply capped at 21 million.

Yea, and difficulty was like 100000000x lower too.  The cost structure for miners was significantly different in 2012.  The vast majority of the incentive was block reward (regardless of absolute value of bitcoin), so empty blocks were way more profitable in relative terms than they are now.  Most miners were operating GPUs (and many at a loss, although they wouldn't know it until later).  
Comparing today to then and saying "Well it worked then hurr durr" is completely irrational; a large number of variables were significantly different.

Bitcoin's price has spiked to $2500 because of *speculation*, and most people are buying/selling through licensed, regulated exchanges.  Bitcoin's price is high because people think the price will go higher.  Real usage for privacy and avoidance of the banking system is low.

I'm having trouble parsing these statements, but it sounds like you think the free market is being manipulated?  Damn right it is; all free markets are subject to manipulation.  That's what you get when you don't have a watchdog preventing manipulative behavior.  But I'm not sure how that plays in to miners wanting bigger blocks.  It seems counterproductive to me to think miners want bigger blocks to make more money; if anything they'd prefer smaller blocks so fees would go up.

It's that poor people are *competing* that's the problem.  If you've never heard that before it's because you aren't paying attention.  China and India are MASSIVELY eating into available jobs for the middle class.


No.  That's not why.  What do you think changed about the relationship between the wealthy and the middle class that caused this shift?  It's *globalization*, plain and fucking simple. The wealthy are insulated from that because they're using their capital to make more money.  Anyone using *labor* to make more money are competing with the billions of laborers around the world that are more and more accessible.


And it's always been a fact and it's unimportant.  It isn't *the problem*.


Wealth not being well distributed *is not the problem* facing our middle class.  You specifically said we should look at the middle class over time.  The middle class is suffering, no doubt.  But it's *not* because of wealth distribution among middle class and upper class.  It's *specifically* because of an influx of cheap labor due to globalization.

You missed the part where I said *settle*.  


Assuming you can find payment channels to and from everywhere, which will only be possible with large, centralized nodes.


No need; Google will keep track of all that for you.


Obviously blocks will remain full as more and more people discover uses outside of transacting.  But the more it costs on-chain, the higher the incentive to use LN hubs, which increases centralization.


2mb is hardly *large*.  You also can't have small blocks and decentralized transactions.  You may have nodes validating all over, but most transactions will occur directly through Google and Comcast and all the people who can tell you *sorry, your payment can't go through because Dad said no*.


Nice strawman.  I'm all for segwit.  I just want a block increase *too*.


I disagree.  Without an increase it will trend toward similar centralization levels.  


Corporate interests would also love to control the points where transactions occur.  Your hyperbole is countered by mine; LN nodes will end up being the only way to affordably transact, and they'll have the power to refuse to forward transactions, effectively giving censorship control to large nodes.




I'm not sure why you changed my argument to *large* blocks when I just want *larger* blocks.  The two are different based on magnitude.  2mb will add load to the network.  1mb will add load to the transaction fees.  Both increase centralization.

That's a bad analogy; they don't have the resources or option to do anything else.  Choosing a job when others are available and not having the resources to feed yourself aren't comparable.


I don't understand this mentality.  Because you can't relate or their problems aren't exactly your problems they don't deserve to make a living?  How does this factor in at all?


Worker ants are driven by instinct and don't have the cognisance to choose anything else.  Are you implying that miners are hard wired to mine?  


I don't believe this is simply semantics; I've seen this rhetoric around a bunch and it's damaging.  This metaphor has some severe implications in the way this system works, and people who have a superficial understanding are polarized when miners are referred to as workers as if the users are the boss.  They aren't.


The LN has it's own problems.  I don't think anyone will disagree that even if we have LN, if Bitcoin continues to gain popularity, fees will eventaully rise as the transaction settlements will increase.  If fees get high enough, opening channels will become expensive and people will end up transacting through large corporations, as they'll be the only ones connected enough to forward transactions to most parties.  These nodes will have censorship power as they can refuse to forward transactions.
We're approaching a time where no matter how you slice it, we need large corporate interests to provide infrastructure, whether that's through mining, running full nodes or being LN hubs.


Yes, I would like some segwit.  I think UASF is a bad way to go about it, but I would like to see what happens with LN.

And most miners were hobbyists using GPUs (usually at a loss).
There wasn't high demand for Bitcoin in 2012, and therefore transactions sailed smoothly on.  Miners were compensated far more by the subsidy than by fees.  Maybe your comparison leaves a lot of variables out that completely change the metrics by which we could compare the two.
Also, your condescension is off putting and makes me loath to carry a conversation with you.

First, where does this computation come into play:
    1.25 * 35^(6*365*24*6/170000)
    1.25 tb * 35 gb ^ (6 mb * 365 days/yr * 24 hrs/day * 6 blocks/hr / 170000 blocks)
    6 mb * 365 days/yr = 2190 mb days /yr
    2190 mb days / yr * 24 hrs /day = 52560 mb hrs / yr
    52560 mb hrs /yr * 6 blocks/hr = 315360 mb * blocks
What is an mb block?
Now 
    315360 mb blocks / 170000 blocks = 1.855 mb
What is this number?
Then we use that as an exponent:
    35 gb ^ (1.855 mb) power
How can you even raise something to a "megabyte power"?
Then we end up with whatever units that is (gb^mb ?) and multiply by 1.25 tb (1280 gb) to get
   936,388 gb^(mb + 1) 
This doesn't even make sense.    
Why isn't the calculation simply
    1 GB + 35 GB + 1.25 TB = 1.28 TB
That's a much lower number to download and store.
Then this part seems a little hyperbolic:


Assuming that the math is correct above, no advancements are made in internet connections or storage and no one discovers pruning, these companies are *still* located in multiple jurisdictions.  You can bet that Russia and China and the US and GB would all be arguing about what changes to make and we'd see the same arguing we are seeing now writ large about any changes to the chain.  We'd also see smaller countries not giving a fuck about where transactions originate, which would encourage "bitcoin sanctuary" countries where all transactions are accepted.
These kinds of doomsday predictions are ridiculous.
And additionally, this applies to *any* block size adjustments.  Segwit is effectively an increase to 4mb, right?  So basically this article is saying that *any* block size adjustments result in the sky falling.

There's no "onus" here; replay protection can be provided individually by either abstaining until it is determined that replay on the dead fork is financially irrelevent or otherwise by receiving and mixing coins that are on the new chain.  There are ways around this that don't require the hardfork itself to provide replay protection.

Single entry accounting is writing down where your money comes in and where your money goes out.  You have a single "ledger" for your credits and debits.
Double entry account is writing down where your money comes in and where your money goes out, but then also simultaneously keeping a *seperate* ledger for the target or source.  So when you receive money, you have *two* entries, one for your ledger and one in the ledger representing that "vendor".
Triple entry accounting is having two ledgers and then also a cryptographically sound "receipt".  So you have two entries, one on your ledger and one on the vendor ledger, and then a third entry as a cryptographic receipt or signature.

I think 2mb+segwit is the most popular.   Lots of old timers have wanted bigger blocks for years.   Segwit without a block size increase heavily incentivizes LN which to me encourages centralization as on chain transactions rise in price.  Expanding the non segwit space allows fees to stay reasonable without requiring LN.  
I'm a big fan of choice. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:09:14
Fair enough.
But the point remains that they have to use existing consensus rules.  The existing consensus rules don't require the witness data for anyone can spend transactions.  
While you've proven your point that there's a lot of leeway within the scope of current consensus, 51% miners *are* still constrained by said consensus.  While they may be able to expand certain rules using clever tricks, they can't do *basically whatever they want*.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:34:09
The mechanism is identical.  Price is set by demand, not by some central entity.  Also, Bitcoin is used by investors; why would they be more price conscious than "affluent urbanites"?  They're investing *extra* money.  If they can move a million dollars for $3, that's not a big percentage.

The price would beg to differ.


Yea, for many it is.  Most of the noise comes from people upset by the cost to move their bitcoin.  Part of this comes from the fact that bitcoin used to be touted as a "free" way to send money.  The truth is it isn't.  
I agree though; attempting to install sigwit is contentious.  But this is a good thing - bitcoin *should* be hard to change when people don't agree.


If they are getting "brutally fucked" then why are they opting in to this new system?  It's true, there are some psychological tricks Uber is utilizing to get them to work more hours, but they aren't getting *fucked*.  That's disingenous.  It's also beside the point.  The point is that market forces do a good job of dictating dispersement of a scarce resource.

I think many people have conflated the word "centralization" with "specialization".
They're different.
As long as specialization can happen in multiple jurisdictions then everything is good.  It's *expected* that only some people will mine and only some people will run nodes.  The idea that everyone is a full participant wasn't even part of the original white paper.  For instance:


a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in
And then there's [this](

Because governments want the flexibility to change the value of their currency.  Many want an option *like* gold (can't be artificially inflated, can't be easily confiscated) but with the benefits of a digital asset (weightless, can be sent anywhere without fear of being lost in transit or confiscated).
Maybe bitcoin *won't* be a medium of exchange.  There are drawbacks to being a medium of exchange; blockchain bloat is a good example.  It's also competing with other mediums of exchange that do it *way* better.

If you are a savvy investor in other markets, bitcoin isn't a lot different.  It moves faster and is more reactive worldwide than other, localized markets but the concepts are the same.
However, if you aren't familiar with candlesticks and trading formations and such, £400 isn't a large sum of money so even with 10-15% downward swings you're only losing £40 or £50.  The upside is that you'll be invested.  Bitcoin is continuing to demonstrate that it

It's a biblical reference.  The tower of Babel was an attempt to reach heaven without going through God.  They failed and God made them speak in different tongues as a punishment (hence all the different languages of the Earth and the origin of the word "babble").

Lyft does the same thing though and at scale will have a similar price structure.

Sure, but miners don't need to be in your jurisdiction to include you in a block.  The businesses/exchanges you want to pay need to connect to LN networks who are in their own jurisdiction.

No it's not:


That colloquially refers to an *address*, not the blockchain.  No one ever refers to someone's destination as "Earth", or "North America" unless they aren't already there.

Which is only profitable if the price is high...

1) Because the protocol dictates that a signed transaction is valid.  If it can be broadcasted and is valid, then the protocol assumes the unspent outputs belong to the receiver.
2) No, the exchange's BCC could be stolen.

So much winning right here.

Why not?  Unless you're buying directly from a big drug dealer, chances are this won't be a problem.
The problem is the guy *accepting* wire transfers.

I've been bearish for two weeks now.
If we don't drop into the low $2000's during this drop then I'm beginning to lose faith that we will.

Way better.

We're not past the point of no return.  If enough UASF supporters do not run their nodes on August 1st, the movement will die quickly.

Burr they know how much and who you are (or they won't forward it).


Except that they will be obligated by kyc to know everyone they receive from and everyone they send to.   Its in the name "know your customer".


Only relatively.   If we keep 1mb then those fees will continue to climb.

This topic is not worth this level of energy.

The satoshi white paper states that mining rewards will dwindle to zero.  Without full blocks fees won't rise to fill the void.
