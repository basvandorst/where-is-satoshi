The narrative was hijacked when Satoshi left. Everyone thinks it's this amazing technology that will free them from paying taxes or whatever. The truth is that regulators will move in when it gets to a certain size. If the core devs cross the line into 'Confidential Transactions' they'll go to jail. Regulators will shut down exchanges which trade anonymous instruments or demand they delist those instruments. 
BitCoin is a legal tool. It was designed to be a legal tool. If you understand this: it was designed to scale globally. 
The deception goes deep. Deeper than most people understand. 
This is not a conspiracy of bankers to destroy BTC, it's a conspiracy of hackers to destroy BitCoin.

That's nice, but everything you know is wrong. Not only is everyone in "Bitcoin" lying to you, most of them don't even know they're lying. You're walking into a trap with 10 million other fools. 
Watch how fast this post gets censored and deleted:
**CRAIG WRIGHT IS SATOSHI! BITCOIN IS A TOOL DESIGNED TO TRACK CRIMINALS! IT IS NETWORK ARCHITECTURE TO REPLACE TCP/IP AND A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE SYSTEM FOR ALL MONEY. IT WORKS AS AN IMMUTABLE EVIDENCE TRAIL. IT IS NOT ANTI-BANK. IT IS NOT ANTI-GOVERNMENT. IT IS NOT ANONYMOUS! BTC HAS BEEN HACKED BY ANARCHISTS WHO WANT TO DESTROY THE SYSTEM!**
By investing in BTC you're investing in corruption, illegality and fraud.

What do you think Satoshi wants? Do you think he wants to see the collapse of the US dollar and the collapse of the US government? Or do you think he wants to see a productive society and economy?
