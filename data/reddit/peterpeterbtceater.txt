Long winded argument for coin validation huh?

Oh shit...they got the private keys it looks like.  I wasn't aware.  Fucking criminals.  I guess if you start pulling someone's teeth out, they'll give up their private keys.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:13:41
You can't seize bitcoins without knowing the private keys.

They don't have 144,000 bitcoins.  They have 144,000 public addresses.
Saying they have 144,000 bitcoins is like me saying I have 12 million bitcoins.

...or it could just be you know....a patch.

Not for alts.  Mine GoldCoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:02:41
Yeah...take your original 50 bucks out.  Lol.

They are clearly stacking the deck to make bitcoin look evil.

Got to bitaddress.org on a secure computer.  Make a paper wallet.  Transfer a couple dollars worth to the public address.  Go to blockchain.info and put in that public address and see that it is there.  Then transfer the remaining to that address. 
Put copies of your paper wallets in a couple different real bank lock boxes inside of something.
That's one way to do it.

Joe Weisenthal...trying to convince everyone that up is down.

The awesome thing about bitcoin is that even if you have a lot, your .001% friends can't just print more and give you free loans (essentially what's happening now). 
In a bitcoin world, everyone has to provide real services to humanity to hold onto their bitcoins.

Bitcoin mining is over for poor folks. 
Mine LiteCoin or better yet GoldCoin to make money.

Ahh Russia Today.  Russia sure is trying hard to bring down the American economy.  Don't get me wroing, I own bitcon and am all for it.  I just hope Russia is promoting bitcoin to it's own people.  If not....very hypocritical.

They don't have the private keys.  They don't know them.  They only know the private keys for a very small fraction of them.

:)  Good job.  Still Conbase could get hacked man.  Consider your security options.  
I wouldn't entrust that much to them.  They aren't going to pay you back if there is a security breach.

I agree with you.  Exchanges ARE regulated by the govt.  They have nothing to do with the core bitcoin protocol.
It would be nice if regulators would just stay away from exchanges, then again a lot of them have been "hacked"/stolen customers money/bitcoins so who knows.

Hmm...Goof530 huh...time to start guessing passwords.  Looks like it was safer where it was before.  You better learn about paper wallets REAL quick.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:06:38
Also, a &gt;30 character password doesn't do you much good if it's written down in notepad on your computer.  :)

Got it.  I'm transferring his funds now to an address I own.

I kid...but if you're still reading this and you got a sinking/scared feeling and double checked your account, remember that feeling and NEVER put yourself in this position again.
