This really shows how MASS ADOPTION is COMING. First cringy romance novels, then replacing banks. You know, as it goes.

This thread is super manipulating. Like something radical pro-bitcoiners would show to an exchange to justify name changes.

If all non-free thinkers are over on then how come this subreddit is the one banning people for talking about Bitcoin Cash and their opinions on it?

Who decide what is the "true" BTC? This is something heavily discussed in here right now, but it is only allowed to speak about core or 2x.

If you have ever driven on a road or went to school and had a visit in a hospital taxes are not theft. Not paying taxes is however, stealing from the government. You do realise that if you did not pay any taxes you don't have any right to own property as no one would respect your right and could just kill you on a whim? Because there would be no unbiased police or judges keeping you and your property safe.

"Trying to act like core isn't the real Bitcon"... How do you know that it is and why do you decide that? I personally think there needs to be some change to lower fees and decrease transaction time. E.g. I wouldn't use BTC when I go shopping as it could be more expensive in fees, than the goods I was trying to buy. I really don't give a fuck about what we call BTC. I just want a better Bitcoin.
