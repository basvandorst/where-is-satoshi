... you too are an idiot- stick to buying into verge and Tron at the top- 
He was “short” contracts- not actual bitcoin- these aren’t stocks. The actual coins he owned backed the contracts he was short 1:1 and should not have been liquidated. He could have bought closed the contracts and his ownership of the 450 btc would never be affected. 
When you sell 450 btc you incur slippage (doubt you know what that means) which is when bots and traders jump in front of your big order and drive the price down in front of you.  The result is you sell for a lower price and pay trade fees. He could sell OTC but that takes time and costs even more money but you’ve probably never even heard of that (big boy money trading venues) 
Now when you sell BTC that is a taxable event, which he didn’t want to incur. 
Now tactfully trying to BUY 450 btc via an open exchange , something you’ll never do, has the reverse effect; everyone jumps in front your big buy and the price moves up against you. 
You have zero idea how corporate trades and that’s 3 mins of my life I’ll never get back.

He wanted to keep the 450 actual bitcoins. It’s also perfect for delaying a sale from short term gain to a long term gain. Selling and rebuying 450 bitcoin incurs more fees than shorting the box. 
What ever his reason isn’t the fucking point of the post though...

Dumb noob question - what’s the difference between running a node and mining ?

No harm in trying
