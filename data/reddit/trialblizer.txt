Just double your investment in black each time and pull out at your all time high.

The best time wasn't yesterday!!
Best time recently was early last year, and the best time to have sold was December last year!

It's amazing people keep complaining about how the government is useless at doing everything.
But they also want them to take much more in tax and decide how that should be spent.
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:42:52
He's clearly wanting to sell things for bitcoin, and wants to point his customers somewhere that they can get bitcoin quick.
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:35:26
I just see thoughtful criticism. I hope you're not censoring too much!
@_date: 2018-09-01 18:57:34
This doesn't contain a bitcoin address.
It's a payment site that accepts multiple types of crypto.
I guess it generates a new address for everyone who visits.

Good bot.
I'm not actually 8.5 meters tall. The power law failed me.
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:53:33
My height increased by a power law. 
Projecting from my height at 6 years to 12 years of age, I should now be 28 feet tall.
(I'll save you a guess, Mr Power Law, I'm not actually 28 feet tall.)
@_date: 2018-09-08 06:13:22
At least he's good looking.
I think delete the explanation of "serial entrepreneur", that should be deducted by the reader.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:36:05
If you dollar cost average as the price goes continually down, you'll still lose money.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:34:28
Bitcoin dominance is inversely proportional to confidence in crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:17:48
This could happen anywhere with a populist government.
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:04:29
It's because crypto as a whole is failing.
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:32:37
He'd have more bitcoin if he waited until the drop.

Aren't they the people who were locking up kids (under Obama and now Trump).
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:00:04
Not if they bought in October last year and hedl until now.

They had a lot of resources for Google Plus, Allo and Google Play Music.
All flopped.
@_date: 2018-08-26 08:09:39
Why shouldn't they spend it on what they want?
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:43:42
Those "shit coins" are just canaries dying their deaths due to lack of public interest and trust in cryptocurrency in general.
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:27:58
The hype has gone.
Now it's just a joke.
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:24:16
Most of us earn much more than we did at 21.
@_date: 2018-08-05 20:29:44
Isn't this saying that he wasted and lost his money and needs a job?
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:19:47
Steady on Elon.
These questions aren't appropriate.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:20:48
Yeah. It's a cool place. Just don't bother taking a MasterCard.
@_date: 2018-08-28 08:22:46
Actually, the oxygen crisis wasn't great for most of us.

He prefers them from teenaged Central American prostitutes.

We redditors want UBI so we can stay home and play video games.
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:21:39
The people selling were long term hodlers cashing out.
@_date: 2018-08-13 06:26:08
Well there's a reason they don't show the spikes. It's misleading.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:57:44
Well, lucky I didn't put my life savings into lira!
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:19:37
Better than Argentinian and Turkish n that chart. Worse than every other currency listed.
But if you check the data, the Argentinian peso is only down 50% from a year ago. The stats seem like bullshit.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:16:46


If the dumb money leaves the market, Bitcoin would be worth about $5.
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:09:35
Yeah, Venezuela wasn't a nice mix of capitalism and "socialism" like western countries.
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:04:26
Buenos Aires. Big restaurants in the middle of the trendy part of the city: no MasterCard.
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:09:47
This is bad news for bitcoin.
If alts don't have values, bitcoin won't either.
That's why bitcoins crypto market share is inversely proportional to its value.
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:48:53
How about both?
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:35:00
1 BTC buys less in 2018.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:54:34

They had bad childhoods and the judge felt sorry for them.

It'll be way easier when it's $150
@_date: 2018-08-30 19:33:22
Yeah. Tons of places only took Visa.
During a bar crawl I'd have to be wait until we moved to buy a round.
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:03:08
Wtf? How does bitcoin affect any of that?!
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:59:48
Nice edge
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:31:48
You're as bad as those people who obsessed about Obama's birth certificate!
@_date: 2018-08-18 01:26:28
It's all quite affordable. Emergency physicians working 60-hour weeks can just pay 80% tax from their incomes.
After all, they do it for passion and interest.
They benefit from those of us on UBI making fan art and Let's Play videos in our spare time when we're sick of playing Fortnight and Rocket League.

They weren't anything like Venezuela.

I quite often check the qr codes people show in images on this subreddit. No one ever seems to send them anything.
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:02:38
Where in South America are you from. Georgia or Alabama?
@_date: 2018-08-06 06:19:12
We'll be back there some day.
@_date: 2018-05-06 07:16:59
Yeah. They accept visa. But generally why carry more than one credit card?
In NZ, they accept one, they accept the other.
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:01:40
In Buenos Aires tons of places don't accept MasterCard. I had to wait until the fourth bar we tried to buy some rounds to catch up.

He pays Central American teenagers to shart through a hammock into his mouth. It's pretty odd.

Do you learn everything from Reddit?

South America isn't as scary as it seems.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:52:30
Back when bitcoin was valuable?
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:03:24
Yep. I hear there's no more for sale.
@_date: 2018-10-04 03:25:24
Yeah. This gets repeated a lot, but it's probably just marketing.
It makes people have sympathy for A&amp;W as they also think they're smarter than the average idiot for knowing the astounding fact that 1/3 &gt; 1/4.
It's especially popular on Reddit for that reason.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:24:25
"Hey, I'll give you 0.002 bitcoin for that t-shirt."
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:02:35
Then fiat should have a B or A- or something.
It's been around much longer.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:51:27
Yeah. But if a dollar note comes from a homeless man's crack, it's not the same as a newly printed one.
One bitcoin is the same as another, but I'd be less inclined to be in possession of one involved in a pedo ring.
@_date: 2018-06-22 08:51:10
I'm not poor.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:26:21
By Russians.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:59:20


You mine it.
@_date: 2018-06-18 07:44:05
Say you earn $25 per hour. That means using Reddit for two hours has an opportunity cost of $50.
But we don't work 24/7.
 
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:12:51
They just had to get to over 9000 for the memes.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:05:44
Well one bitcoin isn't necessarily worth the same as another.
One address having transfers from ISIS into it, is less desirable than one from a freshly mined block.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:13:14
Fits in a bank account?
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:53:58
Yeah. But implies that it's to cash out to yen.
(Which may not be a bad move)
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:28:30
Then why'd you title the post like that?
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:55:43
He can buy one from me for $20000.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:58:55
Are you... Are you serious?
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:05:46
Taking a photo of a sign?
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:16:27
Gold can be mined by the speck, or at least panned.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:15:41
Yeah. But with fees, you can only break things up so small before it becomes inefficient and you lose money.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:18:35
People wanting to buy bitcoin are also decreasing daily.
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:26:01
Great to see the diversity in bitcoin users.
We've got the Nazi flag, anarchists, Pepe, cocks, and random scrawls.
Bitcoin is mainstream boys.
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:32:45
Just buy a popular Android wallet company and in one of the forced updates transfer everyone's money out to your own accounts.
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:34:02
Yeah. So some enthusiast hires space in the airport to try to make a buck with fees.
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:49:26
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:27:10
Worst things is that everyone on Reddit loves the EU.
Disgusting to think that people haven't learnt from history.

@_date: 2018-07-28 11:40:47
It's the same.
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:42:48
Looks like that went through.
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:08:14
Seems like a really legitimate link you got there.
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:28:31
Dear Sir:
I have been requested by the Nigerian Bitcoin Entrepreneur Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Bitcoin Entrepreneur Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for bitcoin mining in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling BTC 400,000. The Nigerian Bitcoin Entrepreneur Company is desirous of bitcoin mining in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.
You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian Bitcoin Entrepreneur Company, and also the Central Blockchain of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your Coinbase account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian Bitcoin Entrepreneur Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or BTC 40,000 of this amount.
However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least BTC 100 in a Nigerian bitcoin wallet which is regulated by the Central Blockchain of Nigeria.
@_date: 2018-07-15 01:55:09
Typical Google removing support for things without any announcement.
They're not a very good company to depend on.

Is this satire?
@_date: 2018-07-29 10:09:52
I was in Ottawa having dinner at an outdoor restaurant.
A bunch of vegans came by chanting outside the restaurant right next door admonishing customers for eating meat.
Seems there's a lot of "political youth" in the capital.
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:32:07
Because if you sell, it'll mean the price drops further. That's why people encourage others to hodl.
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:12:24
They expire.
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:09:18
There was an election, and roughly half the people voted Republican. That happens.
They'll have another election, and even if he wins it's a maximum of four more years. That's hardly a dictatorship.
I'm not American, and I know this.
It sounds like you listen to too much Reddit.
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:47:41
First time I've read anything he's written.
It all seems honest and fair, and doesn't seem unduly negative despite the shortcomings of Lightning.
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:19:16
Wait two months and buy 80.
@_date: 2018-07-14 12:01:10
Google doesn't want to be seen to be supporting cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2018-07-27 21:06:43
Fuck you for making us feel old.
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:29:32
Larger blocks always made more sense tbh
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:06:07
That's not that bad.
Doing same calculation on bank exchange rates (buy Vs sell) in Euro to nzd I get:
0.6152/0.5703 (from Euro  )
So 7.9%.
It'd be better for me to use bitcoin to get me some euros or zloty than a bank. The spread at airport is probably worse.
@_date: 2018-07-14 12:02:36
Must have sold up in December.

It has no value if you can't spend it.
@_date: 2018-07-22 11:36:14
I'd consider buying bitcoin when its price is low, and potentially selling when the price is high.
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:02:34
A thriving business, if the photo is anything to go by.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:17:33
I wish I sold at near $20,000 instead of seeing it drop to below $9000.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:19:10
*Excluding November 2017 to the end of January 2018.
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:13:20
Yeah. You can exchange it for a big Mac during 2018.
After that it's a collectors item.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:13:30
Because they don't want one, and don't see any value in it.
There were only 100 Nike Mag 2016 (Auto-Lacing) shoes ever made.
Every billionaire doesn't own one of them.

It's not in the USA, Canada or Europe where everyone seems to have food allergies.
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:05:07
That's really put me off of it.
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:37:16
Until 2018
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:31:01
Should have done it last December.
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:57:14
Fees at bank? $0.00. I get a minuscule amount of interest, but not none. No weird number of satoshis per kilobyte/byte to think about.
Speed with bank card? It's an instant transaction. No waiting ten minutes for a confirmation.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:56:33
How does that work?
I want an 800 thousand dollar house. I don't have that much money. I can't buy it unless I borrow that money.
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:25:38
I tried, but he just called me a pedo.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:10:52
You'd prefer more memes?
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:36:25
It's called "street food". We eat it when we're overseas as it's a bit of a novelty.
You're just as likely to get sick at a restaurant in those countries, so why not do it cheap on the side of the road?
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:07:32
If a currency is not inflationary, no one will spend it.

In some circumstances. Maybe a plot of the history of time (e.g. from big bang, though generation of the earth, to evolution of life, humans, technology etc) you'd use a logarithmic scale.
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:17:56
You'll get a chance!
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:23:17
You can if both dimensions have values that change on a logarithmic way.
