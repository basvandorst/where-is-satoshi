Like if you buy a data plan for a phone where it says 2GB per month. If you go over the allowance limit, you have to pay extra or suffer other consequences. My ISP (Cox) doesn't charge for overages, but they threaten to suspend your service (dammit Space Engineers...).

You're right that Linux is better at protecting the user from screwing up their computer, but any system can be compromised if an attacker spends enough time on it. I have a feeling that most malware/virus developers don't really bother with Linux since many consumers don't use it; they want to attack as many people as possible.

With all the things made in China, how many times have you been injured by a faulty product?

Why did you make a throwaway just to argue with me? That's the real question. You misinterpreted my comment, that's not my fault.

Reducing your internet speed falls under that. My phone's data plan works the same way.

I've used Windows all my life and never got a virus, good security practices go a long way. And I'm not some stupid Windows fanboy either, I run Debian (Kali Linux) on my laptop and use a Raspberry Pi for numerous projects.
