Check out open bazaar

You mean People's Republic of China, right?
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:02:18
F-droid.org maybe? 
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:07:01
So there's no point in my running a RasPi2 full node?

I sent you a message on Slack regarding the Turkish l10n, I think... (It's my first time using that thing, sorry.)

There are already available browser options for anonymous web browsing. Why create an ad-cartel? 
Plus; charging me for content that is readily avaible on the internet with ads on? I'm pretty sure that I'm NOT going to use that.
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:08:02
So it's like ransomware: Pay this dude to get rid of ads. I thought adblock was free.
@_date: 2016-01-31 10:42:14
Dude, that prince is probably a liar...
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:04:07
Start selling PoS devices for merchants, maybe? Increase adoption. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:06:46
But that's just ads do already? Only not in bitcoin. Yet IF the content creator wants to get XBT she can set up a "donate" button, bypassing the middleman: Brave Browser. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 11:54:47
That, I don't know. I am sorry. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 05:33:58
Tor implementation is in the making. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:10:48
So  ?
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:46:48
Technical issues do not exist in a vacuum. Everything is political. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:10:47
A fucking bash file that will actually allow merchants to set up a bitcoin payment process.
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:05:57
Basically this guy wants to be the monopoly as an ad-agency. 
Why bitcoin users support this, I have no idea.
@_date: 2016-01-02 11:20:10
I read it on the but couldn't find the link, so I'm linking the current application method from the documentation: 
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:57:20
I don't think so. The "tips" in the translations refer to the "clues, guidelines"
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:58:15
"Bitmain will test Classic after the holidays." Now we are talking. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 05:58:02
You wish. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 06:10:56
I love how bitcoiners think they are above the average and get scammed again and again :) 
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:58:23


Well, they are testing the waters for better opportunities, of course. Just like any business/person would do. If that come shocking to you, you're in for much surprise.
@_date: 2016-02-12 06:28:09
Well if stealing from the government (earning in bitcoin and not paying taxing for it) is preached here, why not this? 
@_date: 2016-02-10 15:20:04
"even"?  You somehow think bitcoin users are better? Wake up. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 06:54:35
Move to NH Free State Project.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:16:31


Your story should have ended there.
Also, buttstreamcore is strong with this one.

I _can_ pay in BTC. but why _should_ I?
I can already pay in TRY. What's the catch? Buying BTC and then buying game with it, which in turn will be turned to fiat again through BitPay is going to help BitPay get rich mostly.
Though I think it will help BTC spread more and even might help keep it steady a bit _if_ used widely by Steam users, I still don't see why I should use BTC as a Steam and BTC user.
