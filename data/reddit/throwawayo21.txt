You're a life saver, thanks for all the information and the link!
I have my BTC in Bread now, although I heard that I will not be able to do transactions unless I manually split the BTC after the forks. Could you help me understand what I'll have to do, then? I'm simply hodling in Bread until the forks pass, then I want to move it to a ledger for security and less fee's. What steps will I have to take to ensure I keep my bitcoin and fork-generated altcoins, and is this a good plan?

Ah right, fair enough! But if I use that list, send my BTC to a ledger, then use the IP of a 2x ip when those are released (and I suppose the same for bitcoin gold?) means I keep all three and they're secure?
By having Bread split it, I assume that means doing the process for you without you finding the IP's?

I wont be able to buy a ledger in time I don't think. Although I truly appreciate all the help!
How is the ledger easier? Connecting to an IP before sending like normal sounds really simple?

Thank you! Honestly the important points to me are that it will have low fees and high security, as it's just for holding through forks *and* receiving the new alt coins. With that in mind, which of these wallets do you recommend? 
Also, I'd appreciate if you had anywhere you can point me about 2x for learning! I know nothing about it aside from it's happening and everyone here doesn't like it.
