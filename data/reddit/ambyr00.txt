The wallet is your key. What you are proposing is to create a key for the key. Easier would be to put the key (that is your wallet.dat) unencrypted to a memory device and lock that away physically.

Nice to meet you here.
And I agree, Ripple is exceptionally good medium of exchange if you have friends or know someone on Ripple who has coins. I guess people could use it pretty much like they use 
@_date: 2011-06-18 07:36:13
You should still have a backup of that. I'd say it's not at all secure keeping millions in a purse, no matter how tightly it's knitted shut.
Even an unencrypted wallet.dat is secure if it's locked away in a safe or kept in a bank vault.

@_date: 2011-08-28 19:45:18
Well, I'm willing to trade some small amount of bitcoins (from 1 to 10 BTC) if the buyer can pay me through [Ripplepay]( There's a catch though. I will ask Ripple-transactions of 1.5 BTC for any One (1) BTC I sell. Ripplepay will convert the payments from yours to BTC to my currency on the fly, so it'll be easy enough.
And hey, if someone else trusts you on the Ripple network, I'll trust you too.
Buyers? PM me.

So, did Mt.Gox die?
Edit: nevermind, seems back again. Just told me "Too many connections."
@_date: 2011-06-03 07:06:30
With Ripplepay it is actually not an absolute requirement someone pays you back, and when you lend a friend, you know you are dealing with someone who doesn't just disappear with your money. It's even better if you teach them how to create their own microcredit network using Ripple, and watch the debt circulate back to you from some other route. It doesn't really have to be your friend who pays you back what they owe you. It might as well be someone else whom your friend has done transactions with, or someone even further away in the chain.
I don't deny the fact policing such a system as whole is hard, but since at least on Ripple, everything is based on your personal connections with people you ultimately trust. Of course the risk is always yours and yours alone, but it's something everyone just has to accept before jumping in. It's the same in everything we do, whether it's running small business or raising a family. Prepare for the unexpected and it doesn't cost you that hard when it happens.

We are talking about the same 0.01 transaction fee for making transactions as in payments, right?
@_date: 2011-06-18 17:53:18
And if you do have coins on your everyday use computer, have just a little, and keep the rest on a wallet that's secured somewhere else. You can always send money that's left over from your crucial payments to that secure wallet.

Looks like Bitcoin Central is suffering from the same symptoms now.
@_date: 2011-06-14 10:03:53
That would be mad, because if the value of BitCoins were to rise, the transaction fees would eventually end up making it difficult for new people ever getting in.

Why has anonymity suddenly become illegal?
@_date: 2011-06-02 22:05:11
Well, if you give 1 BTC credit to someone and he ends up owing you 1 BTC it doesn't really change anything, you can still use that 1 BTC for buying something that costs 1 BTC or maybe it goes to closing your own debts. The difference in value to other currencies is debatable, but I don't see Ripplepay promoting a behavior that could lead in overspending, since the credit limits are often set minimal and affordable between trusted parties (usually friends).
@_date: 2011-06-13 22:51:44
I didn't actually wait for a low point, bought at 18.6, but since the overall value despite the apparent volatility seems to be holding up I think it was still a nice investment.
@_date: 2011-06-15 18:04:42
So, does the price go down before it goes up or the other way round? That's the question that is killing me.
@_date: 2011-06-21 19:35:44
@_date: 2011-06-13 21:17:56
Or then you could buy BTC and transfer them to [Virtex]( and then buy CAD with them and transfer the resulting sum to your own bank account.
@_date: 2011-06-11 18:20:28
I sold a couple of bitcoins to a friend of mine [RipplePay]( I guess that if you knew people who use it and own BitCoins, you could buy some from them.
@_date: 2011-06-15 10:49:39
How about creating a wallet, encrypting it, storing copies of it to where ever possible? Then you could just create a pass-through account on your computer and send whatever you want to secure to the encrypted one and keep only what you absolutely must/need on the computer for quick payments and other stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:28:07

Oh, and you are supposed to keep a few in your wallet for bootstrapping purposes and IOU transactions. That's all you need them for. Use Bitcoin for storing value instead.

The problem is the code we are talking about is **not** licensed MIT/BSD, but's Ms-RSL, which is not Free Software nor is it Open Source. I am not being fanatical (although I would love if the software was Free Software, or even Open Source), and you are just being dishonest. While Open Source is clearly defined, you are not the one who decides whether something is or isn't Open Source.

Not true, XRP is not meant to be the main currency to use on Ripple. It's always down to personal preference, and it could be Bitcoin, Euros, Hours or even Yootles if you like.
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:05:45
I'm sorry, but I don't think you understand Ripple. But that's fine.
It doesn't matter what you get paid from work or what you are taxed with, if you want to pass favors, Ripple is a good tool for passing them with. And if you want to buy pesos, dollars, bitcoins anything at all, you can use trust as your currency.
Ripple has one problem though, and it's the bootstrapping part. How to get your friends accept your new shiny network of trust-based micro-credit. That's a problem, and finding others who use it. But thenagain the same goes for Bitcoin and other alternative currencies.
Truth be said, if people clearly aren't interested, it's no use trying to convince them. So I agree. Dollars and pesos will be with us a long time, while Bitcoin and Ripple mature. Maybe some day people will get interested.
So while you might think my comment was linkbait or groupthink or anything of that sort, I only voiced in to mention there are other alternatives that work differently and might prove useful in places and situations where all the other transactions are overpriced. Food for thought and all that jazz.
Regulation.. That's not a problem, taxes should not be a problem, it's the human mind where the problem really lies. If you learn to use one tool to do one job, it is pretty hard to train the brain to think other tools could do better, or that you'd need then to do better.

Cut him some slack, some people aren't capable of managing their lives like others do. I guess it's not their fault. Not always at least.
I've been stuck with my life for a long time. Not really knowing where to find the motivation into all the things I should be doing instead of all the things I like doing. Then suddenly an opportunity struck. I really never anticipated what's happened. I'm still not motivated, but I guess I can now start something, maybe go into aikido again, maybe spend more time with my kids and teach them stuff. Photography, I love photography, and 3d printing, and reading and translating stuff... I never got money out of those, but maybe now I could just not worry about it.
Sorry, I got emotional there. Happy holidays, still.

Looks like you don't know what a government is. Firstly, your government is not likely to be similar to ours. There are many types of governments and they function a bit differently. Also there's perpetual governments and democratic governments.
The main role of a government is to manage the country, its resources and rules to the best of its abilities. Enforcing may be utilized, but depending on the country and its stability either needed or not. It is not its primary function though.


No, it's companies budgeting their money into external services. Since the companies nowaday pay less taxes due moving their high workforce production facilities to low-tax countries and/or getting tax cuts from lobbied governments, while the police gets undercut, they need to buy their local security elsewhere.




Meaning what exactly? Not everyone could afford buying their own security force.

Well, first of all Mycellium's [Microsoft Reference Source License]( is [not even an Open Source license](
Microsoft has created their Shared Source program just to muddy the waters and create confusion amongst software developers considering Free and Open Source licenses.
And it would be wrong to call Mycellium Open Source.
I know I would steer clear from any of their licenses, being a [Free Software]( advocate myself. (I know they have two licenses that are considered "Free", but I don't see a reason why I should choose them instead of any other already established FOSS license.)
@_date: 2013-09-26 21:55:39
I don't see it matter too much if other people don't use XRP as a currency, instead of as a transactions layer. One does not need thousands of XRP on their account just to make transactions, and the fees will stay low, especially now that you can create your own rippled hosts. Popularity will set the price eventually. And they are most likely keeping much of the XRP to seize deflation if necessary. (I'm not an expert, so take this with a grain of salt.) Any way any of it doesn't matter if you don't plan using XRP itself as a currency.
*Edit*: I wanted to add, that if you **do** plan to use XRP as a currency, you could also create a complementary XRL (or any other short nomination of your choosing) for lending ripples, "selling" one XRP for one XRL. This way you can keep books on the XRP you send out, if you want.

I couldn't afford either. But then again, I couldn't afford paying for health services either, if it wasn't paid with taxes. Oh, and well, I probably couldn't put my kids to a public school if it wasn't paid with taxes. I think the public roads would be in very bad condition if they weren't being repaired with money from taxes.
In a world without taxes there wouldn't be good public healthcare, good public schools, roads you could drive/bike/walk on anywhere else than in ultra rich neighborhoods. Of course, they would be gated to the brim. Everything outside would be a slum.
I suggest that if you don't pay taxes, don't use public benefits. Do not use public roads, schools, health care, libraries or anything thats' provided with tax money. If someone steals from you, don't expect the police to help you. If your house burns down, don't expect the fire department to put it out.

Arguments 1 &amp; 2 yes.
Argument 3 is bogus, ripple IOU's are not created out of thin air, they are created at the moment of transaction be it sales or a loan. Money transfered creates a debt, an IOU, that's not "out of thin air", there are tangibles, be it money or goods that change hands, or at least services that do. Ripple IOUs can be in any currency, and they can be traded forth, assuming trust paths exist. You only need to trust those whom you trust.
Argument 4. XRP mean very little as currency, more as a transport layer. The fees will stay low due popular demand, most likely set individually per rippled host. (Haven't looked at the insides of the package yet so not sure about this, but it would sound logical.)
Argument 5 is going to be tested.

Not rubbish at all. What you describe does not follow the definition of Open Source, not according to the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)]( it doesn't. Did you even read the linked Wikipedia page?


[Here's the OSI statement](


Also FSF has only listed the same two licenses (though uncompatible with GPL) as free software licenses, others being non-free:
[Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)]( and [Microsoft Reciprocal License (Ms-RL)](

It's not overpriced, if someone deems it fairly priced. And no, selling Linux distros isn't wrong, or illegal, or dodgy. It is explicitly allowed in the license.

You got that reversed. GPL doesn't discriminate against patent holders, patents discriminate software coders and users. GPL prevents tainting Free Software with code under licenses (and patents) that don't respect the freedoms GPL protects.

Taxation is perfectly voluntary, you can opt out, but then you opt out of **all** the benefits it brings. There are tax free countries.
If you as a people, appoint a government to manage the country, you also appoint them to oversee the taxes, to work as the cashier. The thing is taxes are largely democratic. You pay taxes, you can take part in the democratic process. So it's better that everyone pays taxes so no one is left out.
Look I'm not saying there are no problems in taxation, but it is much better than relying on voluntary charity of few.

That, my friend is called a government. When people get together and decide to have a mutual security arrangement, and arrange to take part in funding it it's called democracy. So to put it straight, we have democratically decided to have a police force and pay for it.
