I've not used kraken, but there are usually different currency markets in each exchange.
If you deposit CAD I would expect you would be only able to trade in the CAD market and not the USD one?
One would expect lower volumes and probably wider spreads. If they are very big people will be arbitraging it.

Exactly - lightcoin has 8 plus segwit.
If it were technically possible to do for bitcoin we could be even better!
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:25:30
Can you imagine :-)
This is a big enough one to split over (should we experiment with on chain scaling or experiment with off chain scaling)
I would like to have both - it looks like there are objections to having them both on the same coin.
So unless the compromises are accepted this will have to happen, and the best fit coin will survive (or both will and they'll be different sizes).

This is just bunkum.
Sure a node would get more expensive but how much more do you think you are centralising with 420 satoshis per byte.
If you want to be a hobbyist that maintains a node then go ahead and spend the money on some better kit than an rpi to do it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:30:44
Possibly, but it's really just gambling unless you know for sure.

You could also consider Gemini who are a us exchange, that you can register from the U.K. I think. 
There international wire transfers take 24 hours plus time difference. If you speak to their support you can arrange for your fees to be reimbursed the first time. 
Caveat emptor!
- exchanges can get hacked or go offline for all kinds of reasons. Good idea to have 3 exchanges that you are registered with - that way you should have an available option if you ever want to "exit" bitcoin.
- for that reason leaving money or especially crypto on the exchanges for longer than you have to is a risk!
- trying to do a "market buy" of 10k all at once might not be the best idea either. Before you go all in check everything works with a 100gbp transaction first before you put more funds on. 
- your idea to get a hardware wallet is a good one. You might also Consider a cheap, dedicated machine for your bitcoins that you keep powered off and offline most of the time IN ADDITION.  A nice soft wallet like exodus on that box will make it possible for you to hold other cryptos if you ever want to very easily (it supports ShapeShift).
- be careful about using your personal computer - a dedicated computer using a Linux distro might be your best bet. Dont use your bitcoin box for web browsing or mail! You might click on something you shouldn't!
- read up about transaction fees and the viabtc accelerator (remember you can only submit requests on the hour)
- a couple of dates to bear in mind
Korea regulation update is going to happen in June. This might include tax update and controls, which may impact price / volumes? Or not? Who knows?
China will be allowed to withdraw cny from exchanges at some point in June - price may dip? Or not? Who knows?
- pay attention to the segwit / hard / soft fork news in these forums and places like bitcoin talk. There are other forums too - not everyone supports segwit and you should be aware of it.
If the Bitcoin chain forks, you end up with two chains and will hold coins on each. I Recommend that you have your coins in your hardware wallet at this time - exchanges are likely to suspend trading. pay attention to what is going on in community pages, look up what a replay attack is and while it's unlikely be aware of risks!
If you make any sort of large gains in the short term, consider taking some profits, (just read bitcointalk forum posts in 2013)
If the market crashes then consider hodling!!
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:26:01
It's called a limit order on an exchange.

@_date: 2017-05-30 11:58:23
A few things to explain 
Exchange fees
Some exchanges "clip the ticket" when you deposit or withdraw cash or coins - but Gemini doesn't. Instead they make money from transaction fees, when people buy or sell coins on their exchange. I think Gemini also offers some kind of rebate at the end of each month.
Transaction fees
Under the current system you need to include a small amount of bitcoin to grease the wheels of the Bitcoin network for your tx to get through.
The size of the transaction is measured in bytes, - literally the amount of space it takes up into the blockchain.
Transaction sizes can be different because they can be sent from multiple wallets to multiple other wallets, which takes up more space than just sending from one wallet to another.
You can include fees with the transactions, measured in divisions of a bitcoin called "satoshis" to incentivise miners to process it faster;
Miners prioritise transactions with high satoshis/byte ratios - they "earn" these ( in addition to newly generated bitcoin block reward) once they find the required hash to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain (current max size is 1Mb).
Due to the current transaction backlog, it means if your fee isn't high enough then your transaction gets stuck with the 200,000 other ones in the mempool) and is less likely to get confirmed.
Currently, the going rate is around 400 satoshis per byte to avoid your coins being locked in the tx pool purgatory (up to 2 weeks waiting time - although there are some ways to speed it up). 
So if you paid 15 bucks you either had a large transaction involving lots of wallets (you should expect to be paying around 2 bucks or so at going rate).
Or 
The wallet you used bugged out and sent an inappropriately high fee. You can figure this out by searching for the high fee transaction, and dividing the fees (satoshis) by the transaction size (bytes). Contact developer / manufacturer to complain. I wouldn't expect a refund but you might be helping them fix problems to everyone else's benefit.

Depends on your jurisdiction.

Remember that you are banking your rental payments that would have been outgoings anyway against your mortgage.
Even if your house loses value you are still saving, because it's being used to pay off debt and you own more of the asset.
If you liquidating half your holdings and found a mortgage that equalled your current rent payments you win massively here.
Just don't be an idiot and remortgage your house !
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:32:08

Is electricity production based on price or cost?
Remember power stations over produce and do not store spare capacity, so it could be considered a sunk cost depending on what you are trying to show with your numbers. 
If you want to calculate revenue generated by power stations, assuming discounts are not provided, then it looks like you are most of the way there.
If you want to show the marginal cost of the network to mine bitcoins, then the 5usd per transaction should be offset against price of bitcoins. Thought is required for the relative costs of electricity in each location.
If you want to show how much bitcoin costs the world then you should also consider how much power is wasted through overproduction.
Tldr:- with the above scope you could probably make the numbers say whatever you wanted to :-)

@_date: 2017-05-30 01:17:16

Comes down to a simple thing - do you want on chain and offchain scaling - we need to put pressure on core to stop stove piping one solution only.
By the way I am not pro miners or centralisation

@_date: 2017-05-30 05:29:55
I think the consensus is that fees are too high and the mempool needs to be cleared. How quickly will that happen with segwit?
The simplest way to immediately clear is bigger blocks. Then technical changes required to make segwit work.
Apparently it's impossible to do this though :-p
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:57:41

The issue I have is the reassurances are not there that on chain scaling should also be factored in. 
The plan seems to just be to move everything off chain. 
Core would get more support (or at least mine) by making clear time based commitments to do this.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:42:30
Or avoid tax

@_date: 2017-05-17 16:28:27
So just to check, there's no plan b?
It's a binary decision of segwit or die?
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:43:55
I agree and to be honest I also hope you are wrong. I think the usaf is necessary even if we get short term loss of value, the worst situation is to stay in this stale deadlock.
I also think bigger that 2mb blocks would be good for on chain scaling at the same time. Litecoin has segwit plus 8mb. I just don't get why we can't have low transaction fees and faster confirmations for on chain.
I think most people would buy into it and even ver and Jihan could be convinced. The asic party can't go on forever. If it really is down to them holding it back then an economically viable proposal is needed.
The main point is everyone goes to technical decisions, when it's actually a commercial decision. 
Once you have a commercial decision the technical challenge comes next. Otherwise it's putting the cart before the horse.
I just don't like the idea of being locked into 2mb blocks - seems to be there for commercial not technical reasons.
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:13:14

@_date: 2017-05-30 10:28:09
It just seems different, not stupid. I wonder whether this would get the mainstream support of segwit we are looking for - this would be a compromise, no?

Get some, but be cautious short term.
If you must go in right now stick in 10pc of what you want to get and wait three days. Then put in another 10pc. Then wait three days.
If it's falling you might want to put in more of your stake.
You won't gain as much if there's a monumental rise in the next couple of weeks but my suggestion protects you from buyers remorse over losses.

It's unfortunately human nature.

My take is
While being technically well developed and solving current issues, segwit represents a change to bitcoins "rules of the game", as what appears to be a strategic reaction to mining pools becoming too powerful.
Other, simpler solutions exist to reduce average Fees such as bigger blocks, which would be the simplest way to solve immediate problem along with one or two technical changes. 
Segwit may hurt certain powerful miners, but risks short term loss of value for most of the community

This hurts certain powerful miners, but risks short term loss of value for everyone, and also risks Bitcoin dominance.
Only way to capitalise on this strategy is to have enough people supporting it.
But! The longer it takes to make a decision the more sand will fall through your hands. 
From my own experience, one issue cultural and another is related to how genius level tech guys think. We're a western subreddit. China has the bigger pools. if you move against them they will "lose face". 
That's the worst thing you can ever do to Chinese. You end up being a mortal enemy, who pretends to be your friend but will do anything he can to fuck you over, for life. 
The trick is to find a compromise where they get to keep face, make more money and agree to compromise towards your direction as well. It will take longer than western decision making, but mainly because it's got more of a long term focus that we have (it tends to be generational thinking)
Perception is reality in China. If the segwit guys want my advice it's this:-
Act like there isn't a problem, give public "face" to your opponents, privately call them and start the call by saying "you guys are winning, we want to work together to eliminate the chance of us both losing - we can make a lot of money etc". It's not a smart move to pick a fight even if you hate each other, and if you already had one call up be nice and pretend you didn't have one.
It might involve compromising on the "right answer" to achieve your strategic goals (which probably is segwit). I can understand why you wouldn't want to change it.
But you could swing it by acknowledging he's got more than you have and if the community could be united again it's better for everyone in terms of mass  adoption.
And if the eventual aim is to make the pie bigger, by getting transaction fees lower, adoption higher, and keeping the bitcoin community happy then HOW it is technically achieved is not material (long as it works) and follows in the spirit of Bitcoin's original philosophy, with a general move towards as much decentralisation as possible.
That could enable short term announcements from both sides on an interim measure to fix immediate scaling issues, while looking at layer., and also risks Bitcoin dominance.

But, The longer it takes to make a decision the more sand will fall through cores hands. 
From my own experience, youre dealing with political and cultural issues, and another one related to dealing with genius level developers. 
I can address the cultural one. We're a western subreddit. China has the bigger pools. if you move against them (UASF) they will "lose face". 
Having spent some time across china, I can tell you the worst thing you can ever do to a Chinese person is make them lose face. You end up being a mortal enemy, who pretends to be your friend but will do anything he can to fuck you over, for life. 
The trick is to find a compromise where they get to keep face, make more money and agree to compromise towards your direction as well. It will take longer than western decision making, but mainly because china tends to have more of a long term focus than westerners (it tends to be generational thinking instead of financial quarters).
Perception is reality in China. my advice is this:-
Act like there isn't a problem, give public "face" to your opponents, privately call them and start the call by saying "you guys are winning, we want to work together to eliminate the chance of us both losing - we can make a lot of money etc". It's not a smart move to pick a fight even if you hate each other, and if you already had one call up be nice and pretend like you never had one. It's a bit more natural to do this to Chinese who will accept the "face".
It might involve compromising on the "right answer" to achieve your strategic goals (let's say these are mass adoption, higher prices, affordable fees, more features with layer 2 integration etc, and fewer giant holders of Bitcoin). I can understand why you wouldn't want to change it and Segwit seems to tick the boxes.
But you could swing it by acknowledging they have got more than you have and if the community could be united again it's better for everyone in terms of mass  adoption.

Maybe some smart whales decided to pre-emptively dump before they did.
There's going to be Korean regulatory announcement in June too, which may be positive or not.
Asia has been the growth engine.

You too brother

It sounds great, providing transaction fees drop by 4 orders of magnitude 
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:09:41
M1, 2 or 3?

Only a very small %ge of coins are liquid with ripple. It's like fiat so they can release more whenever they want, not really on the spirit of Bitcoin but you can see why banks like it.
Having said that we need some changes around here that will clear the transaction backlog and ideally reduce fees on the main chain.
Preferably without a hard fork. 
Some kind of block size increase might be the simplest way of achieving this... I'm still skeptic all of segwit or the unlimited - both seem to be driven by unnecessary greed.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:37:14
Ok I'll have a read...
The part I'm still not clear on is why block size couldn't increase to a greater limit than 4mb after segwit changes are in...
I have it on good authority it's technically impossible to increase block size further.

Great way to win people over, you charmer x

The numbers are showing the total Illinois bitcoin power bill and then converted into end user prices for electricity, and then shown at a per transaction level.
The point is to demonstrate inefficiency in mining coins using computers.
I still think if you are looking at true costs, itwould involve estimating how much extra capacity power stations need to add as a result of this activity, because that's the actual cost...
If bitcoin is ever able to replace another service, the power costs for that business would net off as well.
But all in all yikes, that's a big electricity bill!

Op - this is your decision and up to you. Like some others on here I think it's a gamble.
You could lose job, you could get run over by a bus. 
The price could fall and stay down for a long time . Do your family know how to recover coins in an emergency?
You've taken a big gamble - consider moving a little back as a safety buffer - like 3-6 months living expenses as cash if you haven't.
A smart move would have to not go all in at once, maybe 50pc first, then buying in stages to flatten out risk.
I was betting on Bitcoin falling after it got to 1600 and moved a bit of mine out. It's still only 20pc of my net worth.
As well as this you could consider cutting your costs and taking some profit if some early gains given your situation... make sure you have that buffer.

I'm sure it goes both ways - if the price goes up from segwit and block increases he would also be better off on net.
This issue is primarily commercial for everyone, how it works technically is not material as long as it's secure, scalable and simple to use.

Keep trying - you want to try and register on the hour after viabtc mines a block and then they accept more...
I had to do it once about a week ago. 
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:11:07
Apparently some time in June.
That means people could either start pulling money out of exchanges or start short selling again. I'm not sure how they will react to all the extra Alts available to them either.
Korea regulations update will be in June too.
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:49:18
How many confirmations did they need?
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:56:49
:-) great - where is the link to it? Will it be soon?
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:37:54
When blocks are full, miners can prioritise transactions that include a tip they can collect if it is procesed
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:52:50
Meanwhile litecoin has segwit plus 8mb...
Of course it's technically impossible to do this for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:46:57
Because at this rate activating segwit won't be enough if it doesn't get the support it needs.
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:36:01
The spreads are kind of disappointing in morocco. 
It will be a supply and demand thing.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:03:21
From 4800 ;-) it's been a fun week.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:48:41
This is pushing the price up for everyone... Regulatory announcement in June in Korea.
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:29:46
Takin the peace.

Oh dear.

Blockchain.info/blocks - keep doing on the hour every hour.

Transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:08:51
Yeah I was being facetious I guess.
I'm still on the fence about it - we've got a bunch of asic bandits on one hand and close minded techies on the other.
Both sides have valid concerns about the other.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:51:42
I was just joshing chief :-)

If you ever try and spend the Bitcoin you collected, you will find the tx fees to move them on the chain will be higher than the value of the Bitcoin.
So even if goes up in value by millions of doll hairs, you will never be able to move it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:44:55
Miners can't raise fees, they can only choose to run code 
If they collect the fees when they process a clock they profit, based on units of bit coin they have collected against the current price of bitcoin.
If bitcoins value were raised due to tx fee reduction they could conceivably earn higher amounts (on a fiat basis)
