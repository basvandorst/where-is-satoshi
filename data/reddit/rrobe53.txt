You can't move them independently right?

Could you explain more what splitting my coins means, and how to do that. I understand the concept of replay protection in computer security, but how does that factor into Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:37:28
Can you reword that? I'm not understanding. I'm trying to figure out exactly the risk as well.
If I sell my coins, I risk losing the original version of those coins? But I've sold them already, right? If I've got Bitcoin and B2X, how do my actions on B2X impact my Bitcoin balance? Isn't the method of transferring everything off your current wallet into an exchange, and then moving the Bitcoin into a new wallet ensuring that the two are treated separately?

Yeah I sent two on the 10th and it was still unconfirmed as of this morning. Can't check while I'm at work, but honestly this is a little crazy.

Yeah, okay. Go look at my history. This account is 7 years old, and I've never posted in any other crypto subreddits. I have a post on this subreddit [about this very situation](
Being concerned about the shitty aspects of bitcoin that weren't exactly clearly laid out or readily available in any sort of guide isn't concern trolling. This community is super toxic. Bashing people that are looking for help, and hiding problems that Bitcoin has is going to kill Bitcoin before any fork does.

Yeah I may end up doing that. I think it's pretty rare that I'll want to quickly shift all my assets because I expect a huge fluctuation.

So bread wallet gave me two options, I didn't enter the fee manually. Is that normal, or is this likely due to the crash?
Also there is a timeout period to where it will return to bread?

See, and I have no idea what that even is. I can look it up now, but at the time all I did was a bread wallet transfer to gdax and it basically gave me two options. Immediate or within 24hrs. I was okay with a 24hr delay due to the estimated price difference and I submitted. I didn't expect it to take this long.

I wasn't trying to buy anything, I was just looking to make trades. I was also just following advice I got from this subreddit. Everyone was saying not to leave your money on the exchanges, so I had mine in Bread Wallet. 
When the fork got called off I figured people looking for free money from the fork were going to dump, so I wanted to sell high and buy at the drop, so I tried to transfer back into the exchange. I didn't anticipate such a large drop or I probably would have been okay with the higher fee option from Bread. Instead I chose the "within 24hr" option, figuring that the drop would probably be gradual and that'd allow me to make some moves at least. 
I still ended up buying in the drop, but with cash, as my option of selling high didn't pan out due to the now apparent long transaction times being unknown at the time.

Can someone expound on the necessity and use for wallets? I have some understanding.
They offer you local control, and in the event of a fork you essentially "double" your holdings. Don't have to worry about a third party or any intervention or whatever. 
My main purpose is for investments. I likely won't be spending much or at all. It seems logical to use a paper wallet for this reason.
However, I see people talking about having multiple wallets. Is this just for diversification? Aside from reducing your attack vector if a key happens to be compromised, is there a benefit to doing this?
How does transferring money to a paper key work? Once I generate the key offline and have the paper key with the public key, I can just send money to the public key, without needing the public key, right? Is there no acknowledgement required for that? So in my situation of mostly wanting to invest, I could have the public key kept in a notepad on my desktop, but keep the private keys safe until I want to withdraw at some point in the future?

I'm not mad at bread wallet or anything like that, I mean it's my lack of knowledge that made it happen, but I feel like bashing people without explaining what's going on is the wrong approach. 
I thought that the fee was basically offered up as a dollar value, so I was going to give someone x amount of dollars to verify my purchase or whatever. That seems to not be the case and I'll have to do more reading. 
I'm glad you responded here, because even in my thread, the guy with the deleted post basically said go fuck yourself. I'm still unsure what happens to the money I transferred. Again, maybe it's gone through by now, I can't check until I get to my car. If it's still in the aether as you say though, does it just float there eternally until someone decides to take pity on me, or what?

What side are you accusing me of shilling for? I have no coins but Bitcoin and I'm relatively new to all of this. All I know is that I saw the drop coming and tried to send money from Bread to an exchange and it's now day 4 without a confirmation, which means my money is gone from both places.
