I read recently that 85% of Chinese in China have never heard of democracy, and have no idea that it exists. So I guess if you control a country, then yep, no wonder.

How long did it take them to count all the grains of sand?

I'm relatively tech savvy, and hopelessly paranoid that my meagre Holdings on my hard wallet will be lost due to my own stupidity.
There is no way less tech savvy people could hold their own private keys without significant probability of loss. And once that happens they'll be done with crypto and be straight back to the bank.

I don't deny it is, and I do take responsibility. It is, however, an uncomfortable scary thing...
(And who keeps significant gold around the house?)

I agree, people can learn. But can you name any other service where there is no fallback if you lose access? People just aren't used to that.
I mean people could store their savings under their bed, or in their own safe at home, but the vast majority choose not to.
People will delegate responsibility if they can, it's a human condition.

Sell it back into BTC, transfer it to a wallet you control.
Leave it there for 5 years. It's free BTC you didn't have, keep it and see what happens.
Also, tag this post and look again in 5 years and wish you had done this.
