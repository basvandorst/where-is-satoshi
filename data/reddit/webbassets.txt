I'm working on starting my affiliate network for Bitcoin enabled products and services at coinspartners.com and i am excited to see how this can help existing bitcoin payment processors, traders and users. I look forward to discuss more and how we could JV for mutual benefit

while the original listed price for these names at afternic.com goes up as high as 500K, i've come to the point of disposing these names now starting the bid just at $1K so that i can concentrate on my other projects. I've no idea of holding these names unless i get a Joint Venture interest

These are the list of domains and the name coinstopia.com has already been booked for gaming currency system. 
Members at bitcointalk forum suggest that "COINSPARTNERS.COM could easily be a directory/review for affiliate programs. I haven't found a website doing this and I'm pretty sure that there could be some demand." 
The bid for individual names starts at $1K

Thanks for your courteous reply. We're happy for your offer. I understand your deep concern and the price is not for the names but for their memorability, Spelling and the Brand Names that can be transformed into and the Profit that they can help its owner make.
