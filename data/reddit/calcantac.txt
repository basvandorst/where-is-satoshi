Their system uses Billing address verification which is a service that's only available in a few places like North America, UK, Australia. So most of us can't use a card to buy bitcoins from them.

The Central Bank said that there will be legislation regarding the *regulation* of crypto-currencies in Russia. It does not necessarily mean they want to allow laissez-faire Bitcoin, it means they're considering introducing a government-regulated way to use crypto-currency.
I don't know how easily Bitcoin can be regulated by the government but I would guess that if they can't block or tax transactions they're not going to be very interested. What they may try to do instead is introduce a state-owned protocol and they'll issue your crypto key when you apply for it or something like that.
