Ah, okay, cool. Just wanted to know where you were getting your information from.

Is this true or are you just making this up? I ask because I genuinely don't know, but unless you've lived there or are part of the business/intelligence community, how would you know either? Given the size of the population and therefore, sheer number of companies operating, I find it highly doubtful the Communist Party is able to even keep tabs on all of the companies, let alone interfering with management. Look at the IRS here; it's literally their job to keep track of income and expenditure but required number of man-hours is just mathematically impossible to produce. 
You could be right about Bitmain of course. I'm just expressing skepticism at the first comment, unless you have sources, because it sounds like the kind of presumptive hyperbole that then gets perpetuated as fact.

I dunno about that. At least in California, they are mad sought after since they make great outdoors vehicles for surfing, camping, adventuring, etc. IIRC, Honda discontinued it/failed to update it because it was cannibalizing sales of the CR-V, rather than low interest.

Honda only updated the vehicle once from 2003 in 2010 before discontinuing it in 2011. It’s not a lack of interest, it was the failure to update due to fear of cutting into sales of their more flagship model, as they were built on the same chassis.

Or you know, a person who has a sense of humor.
