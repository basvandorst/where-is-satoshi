Have too look into that. Seems useful for predictive analytics. 
Can you explain the relevance of that graph?

The internet bubble actually collapsed right at the end of that chart. By trying to make your point, you undermined it. 
Don't worry. After BTC collapses again, which it will, because we're in a major bubble, it will surpass its previous high. Just like the internet did.

Everyone is already familiar with that graph, and few people deny that the spike on that single day was manipulated. So what is the point of this?
Wait, I realize this isn't about BCH. In that case, considering parts of the world completely outside our frame of reference (ie: the unbanked) have suddenly caught on, I'd say this is perfectly organic. Just try a few currencies on google trends.

Pullback is possible, since mining profitability shifted to BCH for the time being.

No such thing as an agreed upon value. Value is determined by demand. Demand is based on usefulness, estimated potential, media hype, among other things. An increasing number of websites accept bitcoin payments. One can send large quantities of value cross border without requiring a bank. Sometimes the price inflates because of hype, sometimes it deflates because it inflated too quickly, sometimes because of bad news like a China ban. The average trend seems to be nothing out of the ordinary. If you look at early graphs of internet usage or stock value for tech giants, you see similar breakouts.
