Do you mind if I ask you why did they want some ?
It would be interesting that they use them to learn more about how Bitcoin works.

That's basically the role [Notes](

I can vouch for bitcoin-central.net, but account verification could take up to 3 weeks.

As there isn't an official rate of exchange for USD/BTC, how can you define profit ? Especially as it's often not considered as money.

As a native french speaker, your transcript is perfect. The video is almost accurate, except that I just don't understand why they did say "The transaction occurs in Bitcoins, but the vendor and I will be respectively credited and charged in our own currencies".
The confirmation time is also not completely true, but as they did not state that the consumer have to wait 10 minutes, it's not too bad, I guess...

Bitcoin is not just about speculation, you know ?

Oops, I did not listened through the whole hearing.
Thanks for your explanation !

If your local shop owner said "I'm gonna use it for drugs" when you give him your money, you have to take the cash back and shop elsewhere ?
Wasn't aware of this law.

As for being treated like an idiot, I don't think bragging openly by buying a car that you made speculative gains will help in regard to these peoples.
Also I don't see how I excluded speculators from the Bitcoin ecosystem, I just think that's not the best way to show people the power of Bitcoin.

The same thing could be said about smartphones and computers too.

No problem. As a fan of both Bitcoin and OpenStreetMap, and I've seen very poor tagging, especially from some Bitcoin users/merchants who only care about being seen on coinmap.org (not saying you will ;) )
Don't hesitate if you have any questions !

Most pools show your uploaded shares in les than 5mins...

You might want to add "Bet" to the title in order to avoid deceiving redditors into thinking it's confirmed.

Please tag it correctly on OpenStreetMap, not just a name and payment:bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:54:03
Why not a tag like booking=expedia ? It would not add redundant data to the map, would be correct and we could deduce that bitcoin is accepted.

Why not adding a tag like booking=expedia ? It would add correct information to the hotel and allow looking for hotel accepting Bitcoin on a dedicated website.

Signature links for downloads are pointing to download(dot)ele-ctrum.org which does not work because of the dash in the middle. Reported on Google.
EDIT : If you want you can do the same :

Not really, at the moment mineurs could already set the block maximimum size at 1M.
