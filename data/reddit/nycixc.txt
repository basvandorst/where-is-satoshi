Mobile right now so I can't read the whole thing, but is this a new crypto or just a new way to mine current BTC at a faster rate?
@_date: 2016-04-06 17:13:35
Saw that you're the author...nice work. How can we begin to mine QBTC?

Maybe draw up the patent or at least the design and consult another engineering team? Could probably get someone on this subreddit to whip up a CAD, possibly 3D print the chassis.
@_date: 2016-04-15 14:26:54
I was thinking this... It could effectively push Bitcoin's market cap through the roof.
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:53:17
I love this. Where are you located? Let's brush up some VCs and get the ball rolling.
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:58:54
This should be higher. Totally agree.

@_date: 2015-08-01 19:08:06
Thanks! I've realized the idea is not fit for
Me haha... Not about to pay big compliance fees. Thought it'd be a cool movement to be a part of, but those regulations.
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:38:45
He doesn't want it? Heck, I'll take it. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:07:00
Shit fuck that... Still think the idea is cool, we just need a reliable source.
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:40:40
Time to buy!

*Hello payday*
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:34:57
This is ducking beautiful. I'm using this all the time from now on... So much easier than explaining wallets and block chains to my friends.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:54:31
Oh my gosh. You have me convinced.
Off to the laboratory! *Dexter voice*
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:31:05
Yeah I saw that and signed up! I was just wondering if other redditors have been successful in implementing some of the commercial ATMs already available, and if so, which one they used.
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:07:23
Thank you for all the info!!
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:48:13
Are your machines profitable?
This is great info - I would expect there to be a great deal of customer service involved, but for the exchange of such time I'm curious as to if the payout is worth the work? I would really like to expand Bitcoin awareness in my city, but I'm not looking to do this solely for free.
@_date: 2015-07-31 00:33:49
How does one give fake bitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:38:11
Not enough members. Probably the first one will be a year from now
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:00:17
Totally agreed! Although I'm not too sure what else could be added to the Bitcoin universe. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:28:43
I said that back when it hit $1k, so I'm definitely not going to miss out this time.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:29:50
Ew! Circle bro.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:41:44
Exactly. Which is why we all should buy in now, and if it goes lower, we buy more, and keep buying; keep mining. 
There was a post the other day where I read that for Bitcoin to compete with major world currencies, a single Bitcoin would have to be worth $3 million USD. Albeit a far fetched fantasy, but you can see the incredible upside potential that this has.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:40:23
Neat! I'll have to look into it.
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:42:44
Well I mean sure there's a ton of infrastructure work which can be done, but external work? Like Bitcoin-oriented app deployment? I don't know if there's much more room other than the POS/Wallet Management apps out there!
Unless you have an example? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:07:43
This is so cool. You've got my .000072 💰
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:14:51
Worried, it's hopping around now :/
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:58:08
Congrats! Are you settling the funds as cash or coin?
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:20:23
Get it to $530 and I will love you forever.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:29:39
It withdraws using Coinbase!
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:21:10
Sell a portion of your coins and then ride it out with the rest! 
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:11:44
Ah, too kind sir, too kind!
@_date: 2015-11-20 13:47:14
ME TOO! Coolest app I've got.
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:21:46
Yep. Kinda want to shoot myself thinking about it.
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:21:19
Thank you lol. I'm an avid Bitcoin trader - notably this is NOT what Bitcoin was made for. But I do well. 60% beats the friggin capital markets by a long shot (provided we're discounting pink sheets and shitty OTC Pharm Corps).
I like the thrill, the risk, and the reward.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:11:51
Omg. 2 da m00n !!!
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:12:33
Already passed, brother.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:26:09
Yepp, liquidated some of my July-August coins.. Can't complain about +60% gains. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:06:23
Amen to that! I'm still holding onto a few... Hopefully can sell some more as it pushes and then coast and rebuy later on
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:37:27
I'm really weary of the $4k price point. I believe it will hike to $1k and float back down to $600ish at most.
But by 2018, I agree that the price could rise to $4k with stability. Otherwise, we're going to be stuck in an endless cycle of bubbles.

iPhone built in stock app!
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:45:06
Yesssss. It's coming back down to $470 though :/
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:11:54
Love these psych points! Nearing $440!!!
