I hope you're joking
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:40:45
Spoiler the price never moves in a straight line even if it's crashing.
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:27:57
I'd argue panic selling is different from profit taking. This was probably from people already down because so many people came in after the price was already well above 10k
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:15:36
Lol you're delusional
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:32:46
They'll finally let you when the price skyrockets and they get fomo themselves, which will be at literally the top then it will crash and they'll tell you they told you so.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:30:27
Just be aware the drop from the last bull run in 2017 was filled with countless fake pumps.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:19:28
If it worked like he said there is a 0% chance he would give it away even for a price you dumb fuck.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:42:25
I might agree with you except bitcoin has a repeated history of crashing way past what anyone thinks possible. I dont think anyone predicted it would fall from 20K all the way down to 3500
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:36:38
Pretty obvious I was referring to 'you' in the general sense.
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:18:17
Lol you don't take profits on the way down you goof. That's panic.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:17:25
Anyone who didn't sell some at the 13/14k mark is a moron. It was wayy too fast of a run up.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:16:13
Oh no, we're not done yet
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:08:54
Looks like lower highs to me.
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:58:54
Because most people just bought in after CNBC started blabbering about it instead of buying when the price was low.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:17:32
Shh that's not what OP meant!
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:28:59
You must be honestly braindead
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:27:01
You don't understand short sellers do you
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:16:31
$300 / year?
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:23:54
Why are so many people looking at everything to desperately convince themselves the price will moon, while watching the price take the biggest shit this year right before their eyes? Delusion.
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:44:07
This is the dumbest shit I've ever heard.
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:03:18
Except this comes across exactly like something a juvenile would do. I hope for your sake you're just a teenager.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:30:23
It's probably mostly been dropping because of that absurdly huge upward move at the end of october for no reason.
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:20:28
That is not how market cap works. It's just based on the last traded price. Volume will tell you how many actual coins were traded. 
If I make a random coin and mint 1 Billion coins, then sell a single coin to my friend for $1, technically that coin now has a market cap of $1 Billion even though there was $1 of volume.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:32:54
Lol good old "this is good for bitcoin"
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:31:34
Who the hell just searches "stocks" on google
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:05:29
This isnt helpful. You'd need to look at what like the top 0.1% are doing. The top 10% might only be someone with 1/10th a bitcoin for all we know.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:41:53
Who's to say it still wont
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:08:42
Are you new? This meme is way older than march.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:30:48
Yea but it doesnt mean as much as you think. In a panic you'll see the buy orders just drop away.
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:03:32
People were posting this all the way down after the crash 2 years ago.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:25:06
Why didnt you highlight the time between 1995 and 2000 when there were cuts but no recession ������
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:23:28
Bruh that's only 20 years of data
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:54:18
Probably a short squeeze
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:33:37
He didn't call the bottom, it was the bottom for a month already he just pointed it out.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:42:33
That must be why the market rallied the day trump was elected and has been on a tear ever since.
@_date: 2019-10-19 17:46:07
Not to mention that early in Bitcoin's life there were basically no exchanges to even buy it on.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:21:46
I have a friend who bought at like 16K. He said as soon as he hits break even he's selling. That's how most normies are. We will face a ton of resistance going up.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:57:12
Welcome to the fucking show
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:23:32
Not trying to sound smart or say I could tell the future. But if someone was already planning on taking profit at some point, that would have been a high probability place to do it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:38:53
Imagine if you'd sold every time it went ultra parabolic and rebought at literally any time during the inevitable crashes.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:13:32
I mean, bitcoin always has spikes and crashes. That's how it works. Saying "bitcoin is going to crash" after it runs up 300% in 2 months is like predicting the sun will rise tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:08:27
Taking profit = getting rekt? OK
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:35:47
Realistically it was a good time to sell. That run up was WAY overextended. Anyone who didn't sell at least a little bit at that point was taking a huge risk. Anyone buying there was taking on an even bigger risk.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:35:54
Overextended is basically just when the price goes way up or down in a short amount of time, and more dramatically than normal. It's a subjective term so what someone might call overextended, someone else may not. I consider it overextended when it goes outside the 'bollinger bands' on the chart, which just means it's more than 2 standard deviations outside it's normal range. It doesn't mean it's going to reverse necessarily, but it just means the chance is *higher* that it could reverse, possibly hard, like a rubber band.
Now we are indeed in the middle of a bull run, and I think it's very possible that we will keep going, but just know that right now is no doubt a higher risk time to buy.
If I were you, and I were really eager to buy, I'd maybe put in half. If it goes up, awesome, then buy with the other half during the next inevitable dip. If it dips immediately, then again buy with your other half. That way you even out your chances.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:17:10
For the love of God if you are up like 3x on your money, take out your original cost basis and play with house money risk free. Trust me from experience in the last major bull run, delusion can grab hold of your mind and I guarantee the pain on missing out on profits is not as bad as seeing yourself up 300%-400% and then seeing it drop to like -50%. If you think it couldn't happen to you it could.
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:24:29
This market is so easily manipulated. If you have millions to throw around all you have to do is buy some leveraged puts or shorts, then dump all your bitcoin you slowly accumulated at once, and collect on the leveraged profits.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:14:39
Problem is none of the newbies bought early enough to get the 500%. They buy at the peak from those who have been holding for months, and get harvested.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:26:30
Sift through the thousands of indicators out there and find one that fits after the fact ��
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:55:43
Learn how to remove the hard drive, it's probably just going to involve taking out one screw. Get a hard drive dock like this: 
Pop it in, copy the files off. Honestly if you are sure about this you should literally buy a brand new laptop for the sole purpose of copying the files off so you know it's not infected. 
Use a service to overwrite your entire reddit history. Then delete your account.
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:07:19
It depends on how good the password was initially. If the info he provided was "I have no idea what the password was but it wasn't very long", he could have just brute forced it.
Not sure why I was being downvoted for suggesting someone move funds off accounts where the fucking private keys were posted on reddit (encrypted or not).
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:31:23
Deribit. They don't allow US customers but I just use a VPN. They don't do KYC.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:07:05
Easy to say when you literally have not been down in years
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:03:48
Last bull run was the first one to wake up the retarded masses. It is entirely possible they all are going to either sell into any pumps this time around to take profits early, and stifle another ATH. People need to be careful. We might not see ATH for years. We just don't know.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:57:11
This is not a down swing noob
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:18:51
Yall playing checkers while I'm buying call options so if the price moons I cash in with a defined limited downside if it crashes instead.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:23:40
So bitcoin is nowhere near mainstream if this shit can happen. Got it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:17:22
Just turn your monitor up side down.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:03:03
And that's why 95% of traders lose money.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:09:35
Price hasn't rebounded at all in over an hour. Just sideways and now keeps slapping the low of the channel. I feel like we're about to take a big ol dump.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:27:04
I want to get off Bitcoin's wild ride
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:25:35
2009 there were basically no exchanges so as far as I know everyone mined coins at that time.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:42:29
You'd be surprised. That was less than 3 months ago. Lots of people on this forum probably did buy around then.
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:18:54
If you use a tight enough stop loss it would have exited before the big drop. The big one was likely caused by forced liquidations.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:15:18
Shhh we don't talk about that
@_date: 2019-06-03 02:06:40
You'd better move the funds off those wallets immediately or someone else will.
@_date: 2019-06-21 06:03:40
And even if it goes up, they'll hold it through a crash and blame you for losing money.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:23:22
Very risky. It's overextended so chances are at some point there WILL be a big pull back. Whether that pullback is after another jump up no one can know. At this point I would not be putting in large sums of money.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:37:24
IF YOU HAVE A STOP LOSS, HONOR IT. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PRICE WILL DO. 
Seriously, there is an equal chance that the price will break to a new ATH, or that this was just some pump due to the facebook news that will not recover for years again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:18:38
Because most people will hold it through the crash and watch all their profits disappear without ever taking a dollar of profit.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:45:07
I never said I sold
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:43:35
If you're not crying and questioning your every decision it's not a down swing.
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:51:30
Wow a whole 60 dollars
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:24:54
And this is why i fucking hate the news media
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:29:27
I'm really glad we're finally getting reasonable posts again. Not the MOON TIME BULL MARKET BOYS any time there's a suspicious spike. Makes me think we really probably have reached the bottom. Obviously doesn't necessarily mean there will be a bull market any time soon though.
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:13:13
"Target" sell price? What part of 'cutting your losses' don't you understand?
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:41:13
Imagine the government already taxing your income, your spending, your home (even if you "own" your home but dont pay yearly taxes they take it away lol), and then on top of that, they come along and decide to tax the money you literally do nothing with. Nightmarish honestly.
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:20:48
Realistically, I bet there will eventually be a 'stock split' of bitcoin if it becomes actually ubiquitous and extremely expensive.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:46:05
I don't have anything in binance really. But I'd rather they take the cautious approach.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:00:24
The reason it has value is that everyone agrees it has value. Just like every other currency. The notion that "it's actually worthless" is true nonsense, because if it was worthless, it would be... well worthless.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:01:59
Taxation is theft
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:56:46
Yes, and cost countless people billions of dollars, including some VERY BAD people. And get a big fat price on their heads and live in fear for the rest of their life. Very good plan.
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:48:22
When I read this I got excited. Then remembered it's the same kind of delusional thinking that kept me hodling after the most obvious crash of all time. Could have had so much more to buy now.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:22:54
Usually you can tell when the top is in if it's obvious enough. I remember literally watching on GDAX the run from like 12k to 20k. I couldn't believe it. Blasting past 1000s new records in seconds. I should have known it was the top (I really did know, but the euphoria was delusional in me) but kept holding all the way to the bottom next year :(
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:03:52
At the same time, if it goes super nova, remember it WILL crash again. Do not be afraid to sell if it turns into a life changing amount of money.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:18:54
Must be all the Australians. Their charts are upside down
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:06:06
Trust me, the last thing you want is "hype". You want a slow but noticeable crawl upwards. Slowly building but not fast enough for the normies to notice until we reach a milestone like 10K. That's when CNBC will vomit out some article about Bitcoin, and the dribbling masses will for the first time in months pick their heads off their keyboards and ingest the bullet points on the screen. Some people will buy but most retards will keep waiting. A slow, heavy tidal wave is forming. Unstoppable. When it finally reached critical mass, the zombie-like citizens will finally muster the will to sign up for the most apple-looking exchange which is probably coinbase. They will buy bitcoin with a credit card at the peak.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:44:13
This is why you use stop losses
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:14:43
There's a phenomena that I forget the name of. Basically when you read a news article in the newspaper or whatever on a subject you are very familiar with, you realize that the author has no idea what they're talking about. But then when you read all the other articles in the paper, you forget that and assume the author *does* know what they are talking about. Not realizing that basically all articles are like that.
In other words the news is bullshit.
Found it: 
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:38:30
Use Coinbase Pro. Either 0.25% or 0.15% fee depending whether it’s a market or limit order, respectively.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:43:22
Or sell and rebuy
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:45:20
Eh not exactly because you only pay tax on the profit. So at most it would be 15% of the difference between the current price and your cost basis
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:17:07
Yea, I told my friend about how bitcoin was going on a insanely retarded run up to 20k+ and THAT'S when he finally got the fomo to buy in. At 17k...
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:14:51
Actually it would be 101k
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:46:37
I suspect we are entering a bull market if not already. This doesn't necessarily mean bull run!
