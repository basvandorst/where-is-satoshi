Yes, everyone can back a technology which has already proven practical applicability, but to back one purely on the belief of its revolutionary nature requires vision.

Not wrecked, just invested, you only accept a loss when you sell. I love that someone who still replies to some inconsequential comment on Reddit feels somehow like a hot shot trader. Get a life

It's 1992 and you are telling people the internet is a fad, only used by criminals and drug dealers, and will disappear soon. Yeah, pretty short sighted.
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:15:29
No i don't feel it's an artistic failure either, it's striking and stylish, but the different perspective makes it seem rushed, also the cars fly at an angle that their perspective doesn't support. But the colours and overall image looks great. I do some creative work myself and I'm sure youd have plenty to say about my stuff.. so I'll try and be a little more tactful in the future

@_date: 2019-07-26 23:02:29
Well, can't really fault your logic. But i do also think it's an attempt by the establishment to disrupt crypto adoption, or at best to cash in on it now it's worth more.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:47:33
Google 'analogy'

@_date: 2019-07-25 12:58:11
Any advice for someone whos all in and is waiting for the price to go higher before selling? This is because I bought at a time when prices were higher and lower on various cryptos and my average is still higher than the price now. Should I just accept my losses and sell some so I'm no longer trapped by my previous sales? I think this would actually allow me to trade again, cos now I'm just buying he dips but can't sell...
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:37:33
Why would there be a building with the BTC logo on it? The WHOLE point is that it's a decentralised currency, are we saying eventually IT will become the establishment? That's pretty bleak

I agree, but should you direct your anger towards corporate and 1% tax avoidance? Rather than some regular people rounding up their modest salaries? Both wrong but id say the first has a much bigger impact.

You clearly have lost your mind, I've put nearly all my savings in cryptos, and I fully believe in the future of this technology, you just crawl about this sub looking for someone to feel superior towards, get a friend or two mate. you're the kind of person which makes this community fragmented with your gatekeeping.

For the record, I'm very committed, I've put my money where my mouth is for years, I was only trying to recover some liquids, not trade regularly.

Yes but fiat currency has been around a bit longer and is truly mass adopted, plus were all paid in fiat so obv. That's our point of rwference. But yes, if you're holding for the citadel then the current price shouldn't interest you unless you're buying some more, then it's relevant at that moment
@_date: 2019-08-12 12:25:50

Financial authorities are calling this a sign of larger cracks forming in the banking system but no, you and this other guy are the real experts
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:21:45
I want to roll my eyes so much at your insufferable demeanor they might just pop out of their sockets. Of course the current money supply system has its benefits, but it also carries massive dangers. Look at what happens when supply is contracted incorrectly, banking crisis, great depression... What money printing has also done is make some banking institutions infinitely more wealthy than they really should be, as well as create an unsutainable financial system which has its foundations on sand, not to mention create a cycle of ever increasing debt for the state and therefore the taxpayer. If it also benefits you its merely a bi product, most household wealth nowadays is actually built on debt. The money supply system was put in place first and foremost to benefit central banks and large banking institutions.
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:56:30

I think he was merely questioning the need to be on a sub of something you clearly don't like and have no faith in. Is it attention you seek?
Most of your arguments are tripe, do you really think workers rights, democracy and freedom was given by the wealthiest in society? Their interest tends to be obtaining more wealth and influence, that doesn't make them lizard people, it's just the way it is, its the reason they ended up in a position of wealth and influence in the first place. No the reason children don't have to work in the US anymore is because someone fought against the status quo. If it really was up to the 'evil elites' we'd still be in feudal times, if you think any differently You're the naive one. You're connecting a lot of dots which aren't there, I normally would just scroll past, nothing original about that, but in your case you pair your lazy thinking with an unqualified superiority which is hard to ignore.

@_date: 2019-10-02 19:26:15
And what are the real problems?
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:18:03
I'm not sure it is normal activity, otherwise they'd be doing it every day, it shows a need for intervention. And repo interest spiking up to 10% in some cases, when they should sit around the 2.25% set by the fed doesn't sound normal, it sounds like a precarious environment where a tip in the wrong direction would cause massive backlash. I don't profess to be an expert's but I've heard experts, those who aren't so vested in the current system that they'd never tell the truth anyway, and they're saying this is a sign of cracks starting to form in the foundations of the current western banking system.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:16:16

@_date: 2019-09-12 10:39:47
You have to consider it disrupts the most powerful industries on the planet, financial institutions. There has been let's say more than just a little resistance. This is an unprecedented technology, why are you using time scales based on other technologies, I tell you what underwhelms me massively, the short sightedness of people.
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:37:33
No movement in the market is random, complex yes, but not random
@_date: 2019-09-20 21:24:10
Ok so anyone holding, even for a long time has removed them from supply? No of course not. They're not being traded, but they're there. Basically not you, not anyone downvoting me actually knows, cos there has never been an asset which can be rendered unusable without being destroyed. but that's the trend in cryptos, everyone pretending to know what they're  talking about. We're in unchartered territory, just have some grace and watch in awe, don't try to be an authority cos you're not.
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:49:35

Good advice.. I'm a bit stuck as I bought the bulk at a high price, then been buying the dips and 10% of my paycheck.. it's not a massive issue, I believe in its future potential so I'm just sitting on it until the time is right. It gets stressful as my personal liquidity could do with what I effectively locked in btc
@_date: 2019-09-02 07:06:34
In hindsight we can all find ways to support what has already happened, just stop dude. Ffs. You seem to think the only thing affecting crypto price is crypto news, that is lazy thinking. There are a galaxy of socio economic factors which come into play. We need less pointless, inconsequential and  confusing noise of this kind.

Little problem straight away, Facebook did not 'launch libra' they barely announced it as a project and soon after confessed to their investors it would take years to launch and might not even be done at all. It was basically a publicity stunt which brought them lots of positive attention.

@_date: 2019-09-20 22:49:13
I respect your tenacity dude, you're wearing me down lol. I know what you meant in your analogy, I just don't know if it applies here. the dollar loses value only when the fed increases its supply, it has no reaction on how many dollars are lost or buried, their buying power is the same, which implies that their value is determined by the known amount of them in circulation, and the known amount of BTC which exists isn't changed. You seem to speak logically and I'm more willing now to admit if I'm wrong, so is my reasoning flawed here?
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:52:32
You already posted the link.. i should really read the whole text lol.. I'm just tired right now. Very clever good work
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:21:15
Brilliant thanks
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:04:52
That's the thing, they are in supply, they're just not being used, the fact they can never be used has nothing to do with it. Someone buries millions of dollars and never spends it is not the same as those dollars being burnt. These BTC are in effect being hoarded, not removed entirely from supply, the fact they are inaccessible is beside the point, so everyone holding, even for decades, then the supply is decreasing because those BTC are just sitting there? No.
@_date: 2019-09-04 07:28:27
That's not what random means
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:15:32
But the supply isn't decreasing... It's just not being spent, it's there
@_date: 2019-09-14 11:23:48
Hahaha.. are you purposely contradicting yourself?
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:47:58
So stupid, too many people, some of which experts, try and read these graphs like its a beast they're trying to tame. There are so many sociopolitical factors at play as well as financial that it's basically like trying to predict the way flames in a bonfire will react.
@_date: 2019-09-02 07:05:24
'major retail companies accept BTC'? What is this? That is very vague and cannot be pinpointed to a single date, it's been increasingly happening for years. I'm sorry but this is nonsense. Shiny, slick-looking nonsense, and I'm really starting to get sick of it in the crypto space. You might as well do a prediction by reading the clouds.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:56:28

If nobody knew for sure they'd been shot into space then yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Nobody can tell if dollars out there have been buried, shot into space, or just kept unspent for a very long time.

What a bit like when you used to pay for every minute you were connected and some people ended up paying massive phone bills? Like that you mean?

The internet started in the 70s it wasn't broadly used in homes in the western world until the late 90s, and now, nearly 50 years since its first origins, it's estimated that only half of he world is online. If this was 92 you'd be asking why the internet isn't taking off.

Why would the price go up with each BTC lost? It would just remain unspent, still there, but unreachable. It's not like burning fiat

@_date: 2019-09-24 03:56:13
Instructions: take 1 and a half of something and use it to draw up a pattern of several more of these things..makes sense. What you should be focusing on is the bottom, this is the indicator of how many people are willing to hold, and this is going to keep the price above a certain level.
@_date: 2019-09-20 21:26:16
When you bury dollars the price of dollars doesnt rise, when you destroy dollars it does. That's my point. Supply and demand economics my arse, stop pretending you all know what you're talking about. You don't.

Libra was just a publicity stunt, fb announced shortly after its likely to never happened. Stop proving to them this was in fact a brilliant scam to get tons of positive attention

Donald, is that you?
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:49:22
It'd funny, not once have I told you how you should spend your money..  I'm good. Thanks for the advice though

No, most people just don't give a shit what another consensual adult does, so they took the 'whore' comment as unnecessarily caustic. Most people don't feel the need to pass moral judgement on others. however, some people, mostly religious inclining, feel the necessity to scowl anyone who doesn't follow their moral standards...

This is a contributing factor to slower adoption... This? Like some comment on a reddit post? Or even just self assuredness? This is consequential in any way to something like adoption of a new technology/currency??! Oh my you do talk out your arse without thinking don't you
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:24:59
Great, well said
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:47:20
"best rates"

Notice how the pattern of what has actually happened looks nothing like what is predicted to happen. Almost as if someone else is trying to forge the handwriting.. I wonder why...
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:55:15
This is stupid, it's tea-leaf reading into something which isn't random. It's complex and determined by real factors, adoption and resistance being just a few.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:59:01
Huh is that why 1 dollar today doesn't buy you shit compared to a dollar in the 70s? Cos it's gone UP in value.... My only take away from your rant is that you're a none too happy individual, channel your energy in more constructive ways.
@_date: 2019-09-20 22:22:38
I appreciate your explanation, I just would t expect dollars to increase in value if some are buried, this would require someone to know how many are currently in circulation. And with BTC it's even more complicated, because they're all still there, just some haven't been used for a long time so you can speculate that they're lost. The attitude comes from this crypto space, which has made everyone an expert in economics, this noise is its single most destructive element.
@_date: 2019-09-25 07:11:29
Sorry, I've owned BTC for a few years but, what is a short? Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-20 06:55:53
So not 40s then
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:18:31
and then craaash... How can you be so shortsighted not to see that each time, yes there is a correction, but the new bottom is a lot higher, look at the long term. This is what frightens/frustrates me about this space. People think cos you have a graph in front of you you're an expert
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:54:24
You literally said the opposite. Fiats are inflationary, crypto supply cannot be inflated. It might bother you, but honestly, I couldn't give a fuck, I'm in it for the long run and I am confident in my decision. Save your energy and go make another hot pocket
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:24:10
You cant be that obtuse... If blackberry held sole ownership of a technology which I believed would one day revolutionise the mobile phone industry then yes, of course.
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:22:42
I see, yeah I'm terrible, my fomo means I can't bring myself to sell. ever. in case the bull run carries on, then it doesn't and I'm just holding for another year lol
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:43:15
How, the long term trend has been nothing but positive, if you look at it in the long term, the 2017 unbelievable spike was just a glimpse into its potential, and the bearish year which followed a necessary adjustment to an unnaturally hasty increase in price. Adoption is growing all the time, and even when adjusting the price never drops beyond a certain level. I agree that it's a looooong way from being a viable currency, but it's coming, make no mistake of that, and in the long term this is the trend of a technology gaining ground despite the massive resistance/smear when it disrupts the most powerful institutions in the world. The fact it hasn't been anhilited by now considering the toes it steps on says everything I need to know, it's unbeatable.

I'm a loony lefty, but I have to say, capitalism is absolutely the answer. It needs socialist elements to cover society's essential needs (education, energy supply, policing etc.) what is killing us at the moment is the human element of corruption. Which we cannot just remove, so heavy regulations need to be put in place to protect us from rampant capitalism. The only problem with capitalism is that once you take the profit motive as the ultimate driving force, nothing else matters, not logic, responsibility, compassion or sustainability. This needs to be addressed. So not capitalism or socialism we need a new ism. How about ..err.. capitnism?
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:05:59
Well good for you for admitting it, I read it and it's an interesting point :)

A random event is something which follows no logic or intervening factors, or am I mistaken?
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:16:46
This is short sighted, BTC 10 years ago was less than 1 USD. Now it's unlikely to ever drop to the level of just 2 years ago (summer 2017) it is one of the best performing assets there has ever been and it is still in its infancy, relatively speaking. And this is without even getting started on its revolutionary technological potential.

A bit too brown for you.. gotcha

Maybe some of us aren't thinking about 2020, we're thinking about 2025.

Was it actually a vet? If so I have bad news for you
@_date: 2019-09-14 10:07:16
So being a redditor for longer makes you more qualified to evaluate current affairs? Hilarious. I guess this platform is EVERYTHING to some people

Oh no! You wont have faith in what I say. Believe what you want dude, Libra is not happening it's just a cynical move to have lots more positive attebtion for free..and look? It worked beautifully
