3D printed cards would be much less convenient to store though. IMO the idea of business cards is to be convenient to carry and hand out.

Nice save.

No gold? I'm surprised you didn't get any gold.

It's called a SOciety since it's SO boring.

I'm glad we're on the team that has the Argonian on it.

Dream is a pretty big market. Been around for years.

I miss the days when the people who talked about bitcoin were excited about the concept and philosophical aspects rather than making money off of it.

Hey hey heeeyyyyyyy!!!!

I got into Bitcoin (and crypto currencies in general) back in 2013 or 2014. I thought the idea of a monetary system that's pseudonymous, decentralized, and backed by the provable hardness of an algorithm was a cool concept. It's what's kept me around. If I was in it simply to try and make a quick buck I'd've been bored of it a long time ago. That's not to say I'm not at all salty in hindsight that I didn't sell at $20k. I'd be able to buy a lot more bitcoins now.

I'm glad to say that I'm one of the ones that went against the hive mind!

I used to have a super long list of faucets back in 2014!

That's why I don't ever have more bitcoin that what I'm comfortable losing. Kinda like walking into a casino with a set amount of cash I'm willing to spend.

Dear lord no! Stop! My friend did some ColdFusion at one point and that was enough for me!

Should've bought some more at &lt;$4k. I never manage to take advantage of these price dips.

That's one way to describe Van Gogh I suppose....

A website that is ad funded (often heavily) and you get something like 20-100 satoshi every 30-60 min after filling out a captcha. Some sites are more clever and make it more of a game.

You're not wrong. This *is* in fact r/Bitcoin.

+1 for duckduckgo, it's my preferred search engine.

It has 5 in a row. Also the longest word in the English language with only one vowel.
