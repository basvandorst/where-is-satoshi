I think it's a good idea to stay under the growth trend, though a projected continued growth of 50% per year seems somewhat optimistic. 
Suppose at some points in the future the bandwidth growth stalls, perhaps because the limits of affordable fiber connections are reached, wouldn't a yearly increase of 40% of the block size limit pose risks? Couldn't we achieve our goals with a yearly increase of say, 10% or 20%?

To be clear though, I'm not saying Google is behind Bitcoin. In fact, I think the most plausible theory around Satoshi is that he was a one man operation, a cryptographer who created this in his spare time. However, there is a still a slight chance a larger organisation is behind the pseudonym which we cannot rule out entirely.

Having a dedicated e-mail account for Blockchain seems overkill, if you protect your account with 2FA and a strong password (not used for other services) this is quite safe in itself.
 
Use the wallet identifier, not an alias. An alias can be guessed. Obviously use a strong password, strong second password and 2FA. If possible use the Chrome app to access Blockchain instead of the browser, this reduces (or eliminates?) the chance of some javascript exploit stealing your coins.
 
**Most importantly however: write down your passwords on paper. Everybody is concerned about hackers stealing your coins, while in reality far more or lost due to people forgetting their passwords.**

Just because you mention it doesn't make it any less true. As showed it is possible to create a good user experience working with Bitcoin. It might be a coin toss today but these kind of insights lead to payment processors adapting and choosing the best practices. 
You are completely right, it will be fixed. But it might take longer than expected and there will be many more fuck ups and problems and fights, but that doesn't change the fact that right now, thousands of people are working their ass off to create a Bitcoin ecosystem, millions of dollars are invested in start ups and billions of dollars are at stake. The internet wasn't finished in 1994 but the idea behind was good and worked. The fundamental principles behind Bitcoin are just as solid and that's really the only thing that matters.

Satoshi Nakamoto stands at the end of his sunbaked driveway looking timorous. And annoyed.
He's wearing a rumpled T-shirt, old blue jeans and white gym socks, without shoes, like he has left the house in a hurry. His hair is unkempt, and he has the thousand-mile stare of someone who has gone weeks without sleep.
He stands not with defiance, but with the slackness of a person who has waged battle for a long time and now faces a grave loss.
Two police officers from the Temple City, Calif., sheriff's department flank him, looking puzzled. "So, what is it you want to ask this man about?" one of them asks me. "He thinks if he talks to you he's going to get into trouble."
"I don't think he's in any trouble," I say. "I would like to ask him about Bitcoin. This man is Satoshi Nakamoto."
"What?" The police officer balks. "This is the guy who created Bitcoin? It looks like he's living a pretty humble life."
I'd come here to try to find out more about Nakamoto and his humble life. It seemed ludicrous that the man credited with inventing Bitcoin - the world's most wildly successful digital currency, with transactions of nearly $500 million a day at its peak - would retreat to Los Angeles's San Bernardino foothills, hole up in the family home and leave his estimated $400 million of Bitcoin riches untouched. It seemed similarly implausible that Nakamoto's first response to my knocking at his door would be to call the cops. Now face to face, with two police officers as witnesses, Nakamoto's responses to my questions about Bitcoin were careful but revealing.
 
Tacitly acknowledging his role in the Bitcoin project, he looks down, staring at the pavement and categorically refuses to answer questions.
"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it," he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."
Nakamoto refused to say any more, and the police made it clear our conversation was over.
But a two-month investigation and interviews with those closest to Nakamoto and the developers who worked most frequently with him on the out-of-nowhere global phenomenon that is Bitcoin reveal the myths surrounding the world's most famous crypto-currency are largely just that - myths - and the facts are much stranger than the well-established fiction.
Far from leading to a Tokyo-based whiz kid using the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" as a cipher or pseudonym (a story repeated by everyone from Bitcoin's rabid fans to The New Yorker), the trail followed by Newsweek led to a 64-year-old Japanese-American man whose name really is Satoshi Nakamoto. He is someone with a penchant for collecting model trains and a career shrouded in secrecy, having done classified work for major corporations and the U.S. military.
Standing before me, eyes downcast, appeared to be the father of Bitcoin.
Not even his family knew. 
There are several Satoshi Nakamotos living in North America and beyond - both dead and alive - including a Ralph Lauren menswear designer in New York and another who died in Honolulu in 2008, according to the Social Security Index's Death Master File. There's even one on LinkedIn who claims to have started Bitcoin and is based in Japan. But none of these profiles seem to fit other known details and few of the leads proved credible. Of course, there is also the chance "Satoshi Nakamoto" is a pseudonym, but that raises the question why someone who wishes to remain anonymous would choose such a distinctive name. It was only while scouring a database that contained the registration cards of naturalized U.S. citizens that a Satoshi Nakamoto turned up whose profile and background offered a potential match. But it was not until after ordering his records from the National Archives and conducting many more interviews that a cohesive picture began to take shape.
Two weeks before our meeting in Temple City, I struck up an email correspondence with Satoshi Nakamoto, mostly discussing his interest in upgrading and modifying model steam trains with computer-aided design technologies. I obtained Nakamoto's email through a company he buys model trains from.
He has been buying train parts from Japan and England since he was a teenager, saying, "I do machining myself, manual lathe, mill, surface grinders."
The process also requires a good amount of math, something at which Nakamoto - and his entire family - excels. The eldest of three brothers who all work in engineering and technical fields, Nakamoto graduated from California State Polytechnic University in Pomona, Calif., with a degree in physics. But unlike his brothers, his circuitous career path is very hard to trace.
Nakamoto ceased responding to emails I'd sent him immediately after I began asking about Bitcoin. This was in late February. Before that, I'd also asked about his professional background, for which there is very little to be found in the public record. I only received evasive answers. When he asked about my background, I told him I'd be happy to elaborate over the phone and called him to introduce myself. When there was no response, I asked his oldest son, Eric Nakamoto, 31, to reach out and see whether his father would talk about Bitcoin. The message came back he would not. Attempts through other family members also failed.
After that, Nakamoto disregarded my requests to speak by phone and did not return calls. The day I arrived at his modest, single-family home in southern California, his silver Toyota Corolla CE was parked in the driveway but he didn't answer the door.
At one point he did peer out, cracking open the door screen and making eye contact briefly. Then he shut it. That was the only time I saw him without police officers in attendance.
"You want to know about my amazing physicist brother?" says Arthur Nakamoto, Satoshi Nakamoto's youngest sibling, who works as director of quality assurance at Wavestream Corp., a maker of radio frequency amplifiers in San Dimas, Calif.
"He's a brilliant man. I'm just a humble engineer. He's very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking. Smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. You name it, he can do it."
But he also had a warning.
"My brother is an asshole. What you don't know about him is that he's worked on classified stuff. His life was a complete blank for a while. You're not going to be able to get to him. He'll deny everything. He'll never admit to starting Bitcoin."
And with that, Nakamoto's brother hung up.
His remarks suggested I was on the right track, but that was not enough. While his brother suggested Nakamoto would be capable of starting Bitcoin, I was not at all sure whether he knew for certain one way or the other. He said they didn't get along and didn't speak often.
I plainly needed to talk to Satoshi Nakamoto face to face.
Bitcoin is a currency that lives in the world of computer code and can be sent anywhere in the world without racking up bank or exchange fees, and is then stored on a cellphone or hard drive until used again. Because the currency resides in code, it can also be lost when a hard drive crashes, or stolen if someone else accesses the keys to the code.
"The whole reason geeks get excited about Bitcoin is that it is the most efficient way to do financial transactions," says Bitcoin's chief scientist, Gavin Andresen, 47. He acknowledges that Bitcoin's ease of use can also lead to easy theft and that it is safest when stored in a safe-deposit box or on a hard drive that's not connected to the Internet. "For anyone who's tried to wire money overseas, you can see how much easier an international Bitcoin transaction is. It's just as easy as sending an email."
Even so, Bitcoin is vulnerable to massive theft, fraud and scandal, which has seen the price of Bitcoins whipsaw from more than $1,200 each last year to as little as $130 in late February.
The currency has attracted the attention of the U.S. Senate, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which in October shuttered the online black market Silk Road and seized its $3.5 million cache of Bitcoin. "The FBI is now one of the largest holders of Bitcoin in the world," Andresen says.
In recent weeks, a revived version of Silk Road as well as one of Bitcoin's biggest exchanges, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, shut down and filed for bankruptcy after attacks by hackers drained each of millions of dollars.
Andresen, a Silicon Valley refugee in Amherst, Mass., says he worked closely with the person "or entity" known as Satoshi Nakamoto on the development of Bitcoin from June 2010 to April 2011. This was before the rise of today's multibillion-dollar Bitcoin economy, boosted last year by the unexpected, if cautious, endorsement of outgoing Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke, who said virtual currencies "may hold long-term promise."
Since then, Bitcoin ATMs have been cropping up across North America (with some of the first in Vancouver, British Columbia; Boston; and Albuquerque, N.M.) while the acceptance of Bitcoin has spread to businesses as diverse as Tesla, OkCupid, Reddit, Overstock.com and Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's aviation company, which has said it will blast people into space if they cough up enough Bitcoin.
"Working on Bitcoin's core code is really scary, actually, because if you wreck something, you can break this huge $8 billion project," says Andresen. "And that's happened. We have broken it in the past."
For nearly a year, Andresen corresponded with the founder of Bitcoin a few times a week, often putting in 40-hour weeks refining the Bitcoin code. Throughout their correspondence, Nakamoto's evasiveness was his hallmark, Andresen says.

I disagree because I think the Dogecoin craze is quite relevant to Bitcoin. Apparently it's quite popular although much more light hearted than Bitcoin. The last two months I see more people tipping on Reddit with Dogecoin than with Bitcoin, so I guess it struck a chord.
 
On the technical side Dogecoin is somewhat different than Bitcoin, though certainly not better. I find it difficult to imagine it can one day be a serious contender, it is quite silly after all. But it will find a niche among the social media crowd and it will get a lot of people introduced to digital currencies, so in the end it's a great marketing campaign for Bitcoin as well. Therefore it is relevant and I like to see updates on @_date: 2015-12-11 14:31:14

Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson and Yahoo Inc. YHOO +2.04%  co-founder Jerry Yang are part of an investor group that plowed $30 million into Bitpay, valuing the bitcoin-payments processor at about $160 million in the biggest venture-capital investment in the digital-currency industry.
The deal, expected to be announced Tuesday, shows venture capitalists are betting that bitcoin will keep gaining acceptance despite a string of legal and regulatory setbacks that have undermined its reputation and caused its price to fall by more than half since December.
The investors aren't worried about bitcoin prices, said Jan Hammer, partner at European venture firm Index Ventures, which led the financing effort. "What we care about is that bitcoin emerges as the Internet method of payment of choice."
Bitcoin, launched in 2009, is a virtual currency that users create, or mine, using high-powered computers. A rising number of businesses in the past few years have begun accepting bitcoin for payment, from blogging-software provider WordPress to retailer Overstock.com.
Bitpay processes customer payments in bitcoin for merchants, offering them the option of receiving funds in the digital currency or exchanging them for a traditional currency.
The virtual currency has had a tumultuous year marked by the arrests of a prominent bitcoin entrepreneur, the collapse of what once was the biggest bitcoin trading exchange in the world and a hacking attack that temporarily paralyzed its network.
Bitcoin prices jumped from about $118 a year ago to $1147 by December, but have since plunged to about $438, according to the CoinDesk bitcoin price index.
Big investors have continued to pour into virtual currencies despite the turbulence. In March, Boston-based Circle Financial, a bitcoin startup led by technology entrepreneur Jeremy Allaire, secured $17 million, while San Francisco-based Payward Inc. said it had raised $5 million. Before the Bitpay deal, San-Francisco-based Coinbase, another payment processor, boasted the biggest fundraising round, securing $25 million in December.
Launched in July 2011, Atlanta-based Bitpay had processed $100 million of transactions by December 2013, the company said. Its clients include online computer retailer Tiger Direct, the Sacramento Kings basketball team and WordPress. In a deal that linked it early on to Mr. Branson, Bitpay last year signed up Virgin Galactic, which has since presold a number of its $250,000-per-person space tourism packages in bitcoin.
The financing round was led by venture firm Index Ventures, and included Felicis Ventures, run by former Google Inc. executive Aydin Senkut; New York-based RRE; and TTV Capital of Atlanta, all of them venture-capital firms. Mr. Branson invested personally and Mr. Yang did so via his venture firm AME Cloud Ventures.
The investors aren't worried about bitcoin prices, said Jan Hammer, partner at European venture firm Index Ventures. "What we care about is that bitcoin emerges as the Internet method of payment of choice."
The funding round adds to the $2.7 million the firm previously had raised from various sources including venture-capital firm Horizons Ventures, whose investors include Hong Kong tycoon Li-Ka Shing.
Bitpay Chief Executive Tony Gallippi said the money will be used to boost the company's international expansion, with a special focus on emerging markets such as India, where the payment processor joins other bitcoin businesses seeking to provide electronic-payment services to those countries' large "unbanked" populations. Without bank accounts, such people must rely on cash or on expensive money-transmission services to transfer funds.
Since the start of this year, Bitpay has doubled its staff to 40 and opened offices in San Francisco, Amsterdam and Buenos Aires, Mr. Gallippi said.
The CEO said a brief period of ill will generated by the collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and the hacking attacks that disrupted bitcoin's transactions network in February and early March caused only a temporary disruption to an otherwise steady rate of growth. He said Bitpay now serves 30,000 merchants, up from about 15,000 at end of last year.

Right now it's interesting to see if this recovery will continue, I guess it's still too early to tell. I'm really wondering though which factors will become a catalyst for the next wave (if there is going to be one). The last wave from November 2013 was influenced by the following things:
* The Norwegian guy who was a sudden millionaire because of the bitcoins he bought in 2009
* The guy who lost his hard drive with bitcoins and thought they would be in a landfill
These stories were then reported by the media, which included the following narrative to explain why bitcoins were rising in value:
* Bitcoin has gained legitimacy thanks to the Senate Hearings
* Bitcoin was gaining ground in China
In all this led to a wave of new buyers who became willing to invest in Bitcoin, which drove the price upwards and created a positive feedback loop.
 
For the next wave, factors could be:
* The launch of Circle
* The Winklevoss ETF being accepted
* Ebay / PayPal integrating Bitcoin
* Western Union / Moneygram integrating Bitcoin
* Google (Wallet?) embracing Bitcoin
* Any other large corporation / service embracing Bitcoin

Please keep in mind that it happens far more often people lose access to their coins, compared to coins actually being stolen. Make sure you make an **unecrypted** paper wallet, preferably with a program like Armory or Electrum which create a seed from which every private key can be recovered - including the change addresses. You might not think you are going to forget your password, but can you be certain you'll remember in ten years time? Or think about what happens when you get hit by a bus, your relatives probably don't know your password.
It is easy to protect a single sheet of paper from being stolen and you can always print out a second one to store somewhere else. If you are more concerned with security, use the fragmented backup feature from Armory.
 
And when you don't have a printer: simply write down the seed by hand!

I agree with you that the ETF is by far the biggest factor for precisely the same reason you mentioned. And you're right, just having a single large company accepting Bitcoin wouldn't be enough on it's own. 
However, suppose there is a combination of Circle going live, DealXtreme or a similar large international retailer accepting bitcoins, Bitcoin remittances taking off, and together it could be just enough. Remember that the last two bubbles didn't need much news, it was mainly just a few interesting stories going viral.

I think you are seeing too much in this. In my view this is just Arthur his way of explaining for himself and for the Bitcoin community why Newsweek believed Dorian could be the creator of Bitcoin and why Arthur, when initially presented with this theory, didn't outright dismiss it. Other than the name, there are a few more similarities between both Satoshis, both being quite intelligent, having a libertarian mindset and apparently Dorian is able to write code as well.
And look at the wall of text, I've certainly read better prose. The writing is a bit erratic so it's not immediately clear which message he is trying to convey. He does clearly state however that his brother is not the creator of Bitcoin, he's simply using too many words to express this.

I highly doubt any of these companies would buy large amounts of bitcoins. This would be speculation and I don't think shareholders would be very happy to see their investment used for this purpose.
However, I would think it's likely that they might indirectly try to get Bitcoin adoption going, by investing in media campaigns (of which the PayPal video is a first glimpse, but Circle also talked about this) or by investing in or buying companies which are working on improving the Bitcoin environment. 
Hedge funds however can take a more direct approach and would be able to invest in bitcoins to drive up the price, if they want to see PayPal succeed in their mobile payment strategies.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:08:25


This is very odd. If they have sorted out all their customers balances, why should they restrict the BTC withdrawals? I guess both daily and monthly withdrawals mean that those people who have large amounts of coins on Gox will not be able to withdraw everything at once.
 
This could mean a number of things: 
* They are not sure they really sorted everything out and are imposing restrictions to give them more time
* They are insolvent and see this as a solution to at least give their smaller customers the chance to withdraw their bitcoins while the whales have to wait a bit longer for everything to move
* They are not insolvent but recognise that as soon as bitcoin withdrawals are once again active there is going to be an exodus of coins making their platform irrelevant and dead within hours. Restricting withdrawals is a desperate attempt by Mt.Gox to keep their customers from leaving altogether at once.

I agree and that's why I am not in favour of using milli- or microbitcoins. I own a certain number of bitcoins and would be confused if I had to multiply this by 100, 1000 or 10000. However, adding XBT as 1/millionth BTC can be used complementary and we would benefit from having a denomination with two digits behind the decimal point for technical reasons anyway.

Correct, changed it. Many currently existing financial systems are accustomed to currencies with two digits behind the decimal point. It would be hard to change all these systems to be able to work with eight digits, they would simply round everything of. If professional currency traders want to trade bitcoin they will need a unit which fits their systems. Going for two digits behind the decimal point would make most sense then.

As I remember it, it weren't so much the regulatory hurdles but rather the uncertain legal implications which was the reason for Google not to create their own currency. However, if they ever researched creating a digital currency I'm sure they would have eventually come to the conclusion that as an open source project, it wouldn't even matter so much that it was created by someone anonymous, it might even increase the legitimacy since many people don't trust Google anyhow.
I agree though that this all could well have been a more or less clandestine project, with perhaps only a few people being in on it.

Well it does confirm they didn't completely lock their systems just to settle things out, it's more likely their hot wallets are running dry. 
 
Given the history of Mt.Gox, I do not suspect they are deliberately trying to run away with the money. They are incredibly incompetent but did make a lot of money over the past few years on fees, so they should be solvent unless they somehow wasted a lot of money.
 
The fact of the matter is that we simply don't know for sure, so what we are witnessing right now is a classic bank run of people who took the massive risk of still having funds at Mt.Gox.

Looking at the timeline and the fact that the recent drop seems to have originated on the Chinese exchanges, this is probably the reason why the price is going down right now.
 
Until we see this document it is hard to judge the validity of this message. Supposing it is genuine, apparently the Chinese central bank wants to ban all Bitcoin transactions by April 15. It is unclear if this concerns *all* Bitcoin transactions (which can't be stopped obviously, but perhaps they don't understand this) or only the fiat transactions to and from anyone buying or selling Bitcoin.
 
In effect, if this is true there is a good chance it would stop the Chinese Bitcoin exchanges completely, unless they come up with a sophisticated way to circumvent this ruling.

I find the solution where the blocksize is gradually increased very attractive. We already have an artificial blocksize so we know having one is safe and prevents some problems. However, it is reasonable to assume it will become too small when the network expands. Gradually increasing the limit might not be the last solution, but at the very least it buys us a lot of time.

They would only hedge their direct risks, and even then they won't do it themselves but leave it to a specialised institution to do it for them, such as a bank or insurer. 
It would be far more effective for long term adoption to get a price surge by convincing more people to buy more bitcoins. Now obviously this needs a killer app, the holy grail of Bitcoin, and so far there are a few good contenders but no clear winner yet.

Casascius offered to use two-factor authentication for this bar. Unlike most of the coins, where you have to trust him not to get a peek at the private key, with two-factor you were required to provide a part of the key yourself. You could then use your own key plus the key from the bar to gain access to the funds. Of course, when you buy this bar from someone else, you have to make sure the second part of the private key is provided as well.
In any case, Casascius coins and bars weren't designed as a 100% secure method to store your bitcoins (unlike a service such as Armory) but as a collectible, where it is equally important to know who you're buying from and have to make sure you're not buying a fake.

Well, is the blockchain still working? Is the cryptography behind Bitcoin broken?
 


The number of bitcoins ever to be made is limited. It is a very promising and versatile technology with lots of useful applications. Right now a great number of very talented people are working on expanding its features. It might even prove useful as an asset class in itself. Suppose you want to make a long term investment, then its up to you to decide if Bitcoin is going to exceed its current global market value of 5 billion dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:55:33
You have a point there and as a libertarian I am very much in favour of caveat emptor. However, realistically, whether we agree or not, I think it will be inevitable for companies who hold clients funds to be regulated if they want to operate in the United States. And hopefully this regulation won't be too far reaching, but only designed with anti-hacking best practices in mind. Given the large number of people who lost bitcoins due to malpractice from crappy services, it would in the long run be good for the reputation of Bitcoin as a consumer product, so more people would be willing to take the risk and get involved.

Instead of focusing on the persons to get a seat, I think we should first look at which companies should be represented, since this concerns the Industry Seats. Right now the only Industry Seat is held by Ribbit Capital (Micky Malka). Other companies which could be represented are:
* Bitpay: one of the most relevant companies in the industry, although they do not seem to be a member of the foundation. Obvious choice would be Anthony Gallippi.
* Coinbase: another very important payment processor and a silver member of the foundation. Could be Brian Armstrong or Fred Ehrsam.
* Circle: although not yet active, they seem to have very big plans. Also a gold member of the foundation, which shows their dedication. Jeremy Allaire.
* Second Market: already invested heavily in Bitcoin with plans to increase their involvement. Not a member though. Barry Silbert.
* Winklevoss Capital: very relevant if their ETF succeeds. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.
* Blockchain.info: also not a member of the foundation, though a company with a key position. Has three very strong candidates in Nicolas Cary, Roger Ver and Andreas Antonopoulos.
* Bitcoinstore: not the most obvious candidate, but the only platinum member of the Bitcoin Foundation.
* Bitstamp: not a member either, but a very important company for Bitcoin and a logical replacement for Mt.Gox. Nejc Kodrič.
* BTCChina: relevant once, not so relevant any longer, but who knows what the future might bring? Bobby Lee.

The difference is that people were curious to go online and see what they could find there. If you're curious about Bitcoin you might read an article about it, but there's no real need to actually buy coins since you can already pay for anything with a credit card or whatever you were using before. 
That's why I think we can expect more from Bitcoin as a way to save money for businesses, as that would lead to a stronger incentive for adoption.
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:24:00
This is absolutely un-fucking-believable. The audacity and hubris displayed by this incompetent moron to have the god-damned guts to blame the Bitcoin Foundation for the problems his shitty excuse for a company is facing is simply beyond believe. The only thing I can imagine is that somehow making millions in a few years out of sheer luck rather than talent, intelligence or hard work has made himself believe he has the right to make outrageous claims such as these.
 


What the fuck man? The only person employed by the Bitcoin Foundation, where you are accidentally a board member, is Gavin Andresen, who has done tremendous efforts over the last couple of years to turn a experimental open-source project into the basis for future global finance. 


Seriously? What do you think Gavin and all those other developers, most of whom are working on Bitcoin without a direct financial compensation, are doing? Playing with their dicks on a skippybal from an office in Tokyo while watching their profits grow? Perhaps they try to be cautious in fixing all the bugs and features Bitcoin has so this technology remains safe for everyone to use. 
You were fully aware of transaction malleability for a few years now, were warned to update your crappy software and you have decided to blame the core developers because your company was unable to implement recommended best practices? How dare you motherfucker.

A transaction will only be seen by the network if you actually move bitcoins from one address to another one and broadcast this transaction to the network (which is done automatically on a hot wallet). 
If you just import the cold wallet to a hot wallet there is no transaction going on, you're simply giving the hot wallet  access to the bitcoins from the cold wallet.
It is also possible to sign a transaction from a cold wallet before broadcasting it to the network, while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the cold wallet (it is still protected from keyloggers or other malware). This is a feature in Armory and while it sounds complicated, it is actually as easy as moving a file from one computer to the other with an USB stick.

I don't think sidechains are going to replace altcoins altogether, since some of them will still have features Bitcoin won't have, even with sidechains, such as proof of stake. 
It does make Bitcoin incredibly more innovative though and can in the long run solve many problems, such as scalability, transaction speed and privacy. If sidechains work out well then the chance Bitcoin will fail somewhere in the future is greatly diminished and your investment is much, much more secure.

From all the options Lawsky could have chosen from, he has chosen a very favourable path for Bitcoin. He acknowledges that money laundering is not as rampant within virtual currencies as he previously may have thought, stating:


Furthermore, he is focusing on consumer protection by making sure all businesses holding bitcoins need to have enough capital at hand to prevent the loss of consumer funds. Also:


Which is a true and fair warning. If this is a hint at the final Bitlicense New York is going to issue (and which might become a blueprint for the other states) this would be very welcome.

* Circle will make it easier to buy and use Bitcoin and they've hinted at creating a marketing campaign to gain more users. When they go live, I expect many current Bitcoin users to try out their service and buy some coins. This will lead to increased demand.
* Coinbase will open in Europe. Many people want to try out their service, so this will lead to increased demand as well.
* The Winklevii ETF will open up a door for speculators willing to bet on Bitcoin without being exposed to exchanges, wallets and more stuff too complicated for the not so tech-savvy amongst ourselves.
* It will be interesting to see what the next proposal from the NYDFS will be. If this turns out to be much more relaxed than the previous proposal, a collective sigh of relief might follow and the price might climb.

I usually explain that Bitcoin isn't perfect and there is no absolute guarantee it will succeed, just that it can do some things which had been impossible until now and that given its versatility and all the talented people working on it, I'm sure it will have a place in the future.
And to be honest, Bitcoin is a very abstract concept for many people, you can try to convince them all you like but they won't budge until it has proven itself in ways it hasn't done yet. But I guess that gives people with more imagination a nice opportunity to get some cheap coins.

Remittances is absolutely the place where I think Bitcoin can have the most impact. However, Western Union and Moneygram don't have to be immediately replaced. 
Suppose one of them integrates Bitcoin into their own systems so they can offer lower rates under certain circumstances to their existing customers. They could cut the rates in half by offering fiat -&gt; bitcoin or bitcoin -&gt; fiat transactions, where either only the sender or receiver has to use Bitcoin.
That way they can gain market share and attract new customers. Their stockholders will praise them for being innovative. We don't necessarily need a revolution, evolution would be fine.

If there was no chance for me and countless others to get rich by investing in Bitcoin, I wouldn't have given it nearly as much thought as I did the past year.

I wouldn't be surprised if Satoshi made sure not to leave any sensitive information in his known e-mail account just in case something like this happened. After all, otherwise it would have been possible for either people at GMX or perhaps even the NSA to find out his real identity.

Exactly, I think this is the best explanation. Up until a month ago we saw all these log charts which made it seem like the next bubble had to be imminent, yet it never came. When it became clear that the price slumped instead, all these hopes faded and people moved away.
 
This feels a lot like 2012, when Bitcoin moved more or less sideways for a long period of time, but came out with a much stronger infrastructure compared to the bubble of 2011. What matters is that there are plenty of companies working on great applications so that the next time Bitcoin gains the attention of the media, we can say that a lot of progress has been made compared to the peaks of December 2013. I have no clue how long this phase will last, but fundamentally most things are looking quite good.

In fact, he never even heard Nakamoto's voice, because the founder of Bitcoin would not communicate by phone. Their interactions, he says, always took place by "email or private message on the Bitcointalk forum," where enthusiasts meet online.
"He was the kind of person who, if you made an honest mistake, he might call you an idiot and never speak to you again," Andresen says. "Back then, it was not clear that creating Bitcoin might be a legal thing to do. He went to great lengths to protect his anonymity."
Nakamoto also ignored all of Andresen's questions about where he was from, his professional background, what other projects he'd worked on and whether his name was real or a pseudonym (many of Bitcoin's devotees use pseudonyms). "He was never chatty," Andresen says. "All we talked about was code."
Andresen, an Australian who graduated from Princeton with a Bachelor's in computer science, eventually became Nakamoto's point person on a growing team of international coders and programmers who worked on a volunteer basis to perfect the Bitcoin code after its inauspicious launch in January 2009.
Andresen originally heard about Bitcoin the following year through a blog he followed. He reached out to Nakamoto through one of the Bitcoin founder's untraceable email addresses and offered his assistance. His initial message to Bitcoin's inventor read: "Bitcoin is a brilliant idea, and I want to help. What do you need?"
Andresen says he didn't give much thought to working for an anonymous inventor. "I am a geek," he says simply. "I don't care if the idea came from a good person or an evil person. Ideas stand on their own."
Other developers were driven by "enlightened self-interest," profit or personal politics, he says. But nearly all were intrigued by the promise of a digital currency accessible to anyone in the world that could bypass central banks at a time when the global financial system was on life support. In this respect, the launch of Bitcoin could not have been better timed.
In 2008, just before Bitcoin's official kickoff, a somewhat stiffly written, nine-page proposal found its way onto the Internet bearing the name and email address of Satoshi Nakamoto.
The paper proposed "electronic cash" that "would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution," with transactions time-stamped and viewable to all.
The masterstroke was replacing the role of banks as the trusted middlemen with Bitcoin users, who would act as sentinels for the integrity of the system, verifying transactions using their computing power in exchange for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin production is designed to move at a carefully calibrated pace to boost value and scarcity and remain inflation proof, halving its quantity every four years, and is designed to stop proliferating when Bitcoins reach a total of 21 million in 2140. (Bitcoins can be divided by up to eight decimal places, with the smallest units called "satoshis.")
"I got the impression that Satoshi was really doing it for political reasons," says Andresen, who gets paid in Bitcoins - along with a half-dozen other Bitcoin core developers working everywhere from Silicon Valley to Switzerland - by the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit working to standardize the currency.
He doesn't like the system we have today and wanted a different one that would be more equal. He did not like the notion of banks and bankers getting wealthy just because they hold the keys," says Andresen.
Holding the keys has also made early comers to Bitcoin wealthy beyond measure. "I made a small investment in Bitcoin and it is actually enough that I could now retire if I wanted to," Andresen says. "Overall, I've made about $800 per penny I've invested. It's insane."
One of the first people to start working with Bitcoin's founder in 2009 was Martti Malmi, 25, a Helsinki programmer who invested in Bitcoins. "I sold them in 2011 and bought a nice apartment," he says. "Today, I could have bought 100 nice apartments."
Communication with Bitcoin's founder was becoming less frequent by early 2011. Nakamoto stopped posting changes to the Bitcoin code and ignored conversations on the Bitcoin forum.
Andresen was unprepared, however, for Satoshi Nakamoto's reaction to an email exchange between them on April 26, 2011.
"I wish you wouldn't keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure," Nakamoto wrote to Andresen. "The press just turns that into a pirate currency angle.  Maybe instead make it about the open source project and give more credit to your dev contributors; it helps motivate them."
Andresen responded: "Yeah, I'm not happy with the 'wacky pirate money' tone, either."
Then he told Nakamoto he'd accepted an invitation to speak at the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters. "I hope that by talking directly to them and, more importantly, listening to their questions/concerns, they will think of Bitcoin the way I do - as a just-plain-better, more efficient, less-subject-to-political-whims money," he said. "Not as an all-powerful black-market tool that will be used by anarchists to overthrow the System."
From that moment, Satoshi Nakamoto stopped responding to emails and dropped off the map.
Nakamoto's family describe him as extremely intelligent, moody and obsessively private, a man of few words who screens his phone calls, anonymizes his emails and, for most of his life, has been preoccupied with the two things for which Bitcoin has now become known: money and secrecy.
For the past 40 years, Satoshi Nakamoto has not used his birth name in his daily life. At the age of 23, after graduating from California State Polytechnic University, he changed his name to "Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto," according to records filed with the U.S. District Court of Los Angeles in 1973. Since then, he has not used the name Satoshi but instead signs his name "Dorian S. Nakamoto."
Descended from Samurai and the son of a Buddhist priest, Nakamoto was born in July 1949 in the city of Beppu, Japan, where he was brought up poor in the Buddhist tradition by his mother, Akiko. In 1959, after a divorce and remarriage, she immigrated to California, taking her three sons with her. Now age 93, she lives with Nakamoto in Temple City.
Nakamoto did not get along with his stepfather, but his aptitude for math and science was evident from an early age, says Arthur, who also notes, "He is fickle and has very weird hobbies."
Just after graduating college, Nakamoto went to work on defense and electronics communications for Hughes Aircraft in southern California. "That was just the beginning," says Arthur, who also worked at Hughes. "He is the only person I have ever known to show up for a job interview and tell the interviewer he's an idiot - and then prove it."
Nakamoto has six children. The first, a son from his first marriage in the 1980's, is Eric Nakamoto, an animation and 3-D graphics designer in Philadelphia. His next five children were with his second wife, Grace Mitchell, 56, who lives in Audubon, N.J., and says she met Nakamoto at a Unitarian church mixer in Cherry Hill, N.J., in the mid-1980s. She recalls he came to the East Coast after leaving Hughes Aircraft, now part of Raytheon, in his 20s and next worked for Radio Corporation of America in Camden, N.J., as a systems engineer.
"We were doing defensive electronics and communications for the military, government aircraft and warships, but it was classified and I can't really talk about it," confirms David Micha, president of the company now called L-3 Communications.
Mitchell says her husband "did not talk much about his work" and sometimes took on military projects independent of RCA. In 1987, the couple moved back to California, where Nakamoto worked as a computer engineer for communications and technologies companies in the Los Angeles area, including financial information service Quotron Systems Inc., sold in 1994 to Reuters, and Nortel Networks.
Nakamoto, who was laid off twice in the 1990s, according to Mitchell, fell behind on mortgage payments and taxes and their home was foreclosed. That experience, says Nakamoto's oldest daughter, Ilene Mitchell, 26, may have informed her father's attitude toward banks and the government.
A libertarian, Nakamoto encouraged his daughter to be independent, start her own business and "not be under the government's thumb," she says. "He was very wary of the government, taxes and people in charge."

Well once the Winklevii ETF (or some other ETF) would be launched, it's an easy and safe way to buy a lot of coins if you don't own them already.
 
However, the vast majority of those who *right now* own a large sum of bitcoins are probably aware of ways to protect their coins in ways safer than any bank or fund could provide, at much lower costs (no 1% fee). So handing them over to a third party wouldn't really benefit them in any way. However, they might be interested in services like a debit card or tax advise, but that goes up for smaller holders as well.

Volatility is the most overrated problem within Bitcoin. It can be easily fixed by payment processors (which paypal could become)  and in practice doesn't seem to prevent people from buying,  spending or saving bitcoins. Besides that volatility is inevitable if you try to build a currency from scratch and more importantly, actually desired since it gives people an incentive to profit from adopting Bitcoin, thereby gaining critical mass. Eventually, when Bitcoin becomes larger, volatility will even be solved automatically.

Typical response from Mark Karpeles acting like an entitled spoiled brat once again. It is incredible this guy fails to see that working with experimental open source software doesn't give you guarantees, you have to make sure you are prepared for any problem yourself. Mt.Gox should be blamed, they were aware there was a problem in the protocol, they had the time and means to adapt their own software so it could cope with this issue.
 
And it is a recurring pattern: in 2011 Mt.Gox got hacked and lost all sorts of customer data, only after this incident did they made security their top priority. In March 2013 they were unable to cope with the influx of new customers resulting in large verification delays. A month later their trading platform broke down amidst a larger than expected number of trades. Last summer they found out they were unable to cope with fiat withdrawals and now they were unprepared for the transaction malleability bug.
Bitcoin has been growing exponentially since 2009 and time and time again Mt.Gox didn't see this growth coming and was unprepared. There is so much money to make in this industry and being the first means that you have a duty to stay ahead of the competition and always provide an excellent service. Karpeles lacks the talent to run this company, it would be best for us and for him if he sells his stake, resigns from the Bitcoin Foundation and moves on to other projects.

There is a reason, he is facing massive legal charges from all corners of the world. From the chat we know that he had an appointment with a lawyer this morning, they probably instructed everyone not to speak to anyone. From now on the only thing left to do is damage control.
For those with money inside: Mt.Gox will probably be liquidated, as I can't imagine why any company wants to buy it. Its brand isn't worth shit right now and it's a lot easier and cheaper to set up a new exchange. It could take years before the whole mess is cleaned up, lets hope there is something left after that.

Adam Cohen isn't a moron, he seems reasonably intelligent actually. He does have a severely limited imagination.

He neglected that these drawbacks could be improved upon, that it could solve problems the current system couldn't solve and that it creates a whole new range of possibilities. Unfortunately for him, he wasn't able to think in such imaginative ways.

Since you are a business owner, it is a good thing to explain the following points:
* Bitcoin might be volatile, but this isn't an issue for you. By using a payment processor such as Bitpay, you can get the bitcoins you receive automatically converted to pounds, dollars or euros, so there's no currency risk for you.
* Then why should a merchant accept Bitcoin? Because the fees are much lower compared to other payment solutions, even as low as 0% transaction costs.
* Owning a cafe, Bitcoin enables your customers to pay without cards, by using their smartphones while you only need a tablet with an internet connection.
* For merchants with a lot of international customers, the advantages of accepting Bitcoin are even greater. Bitcoin is global, unlike things as credit cards, PayPal or archaic banking solutions. All at very low costs.
* Why should people want to pay in Bitcoin then? Because they might want to purchase stuff abroad, pay with their phone or because merchants give a discount for paying in Bitcoin (as they profit from lower transaction costs).
* But people don't want to spend a currency which only appreciates in value, they might say. This has proven not to be true, as people actually use Bitcoin in ever greater numbers. It's also easy to buy new coins to replace the ones you've spent.
* Finally, there are advantages for you as a merchant because a Bitcoin transaction can't be reversed, which protects you against fraud. When a customer has an issue and wants their money back, this can be handled the same way cash payments are handled.
Finally, what is Bitcoin? It is essentially transport system for value, which operates at lower costs and higher speeds than all of its competitors, to anyone in the world. As a protocol, it is very versatile and can easily be expanded upon by one of the countless businesses or developers currently working on it. Because of it decentralised design, it is extremely robust, like the internet itself. Bitcoin is here to stay and will change the world.

@_date: 2014-02-18 09:58:55
There is quite some pessimism the last few weeks which is not entirely warranted. There are absolutely things to worry about but the status of Mt.Gox and the transaction malleability issue are not among them. 
A year ago, the main issue was the dependency of Bitcoin on too few exchanges, which has since been solved. Last summer, the main issue was that while Bitcoin adoption had been growing, there was no killer app. This is still true, but we had a few large retailers enthusiastically entering the game, Bitpay, Coinbase and others are working hard on getting more companies involved and within the porn niche Bitcoin seems quite successful. 
 
Meanwhile, the true potential of Bitcoin hasn't even been touched yet. I think it won't be most valuable as an alternative to Paypal or credit cards, but more as a B2B tool for sending money across borders and as an alternative asset class with little correlation to more established asset classes. The two things that matter most are the technical fundamentals and the legal status.
 
On the technical side, the brilliant thing about Bitcoin is that Satoshi created a system of perfectly balanced incentives. Every participant in Bitcoin gains most by keeping the system strong and intact, which can be achieved by solving bugs and issues as effectively as possible while tampering with the core values as little as possible. I can't tell if it remains that way, but so far it looks good. The bugs within the network seem fewer in number, have less impact and so far everything could be easily solved.
  
On the legal side the reaction of the US government is the most important factor and I am more positive on this than many people around here. Perhaps I'm naive but those in charge seem to recognise the potential value in Bitcoin and besides that, it looks like the public (i.e. the voters) seem largely positive as well. Yes, Bitcoin's reputation took a blow but ever more people take the time to learn about it and come to appreciate the good things Bitcoin stands for. I'm not sure what kind of regulation there will be eventually, but it looks to me like the businesses currently involved are able to cope with it, so in the long term this will work out fine.
@_date: 2014-04-23 08:41:14
* I don't think it's much of a problem only a few people are in control of the places were people talk about Bitcoin. Both on the forum and on Reddit there is a massive amount of talk and rigorous censorship seems infeasible to me. 
* I don't care much about the ownership of Bitcoin either. Practically anything of value has an 'unfair' distribution, it's simply how human nature works. You can read Taleb if you want to know why.
* The few places where people could buy and sell Bitcoin had me worried last year, so I'm glad this situation turned around. In my opinion this is still the weakest spot though.
* The lack of incentives and rewards for nodes could be a problem. A solution could be that companies who rely on the Bitcoin infrastructure pay for setting up their own nodes, perhaps through the Bitcoin foundation? After all setting up a node is relatively easy and cheap.
* Developing being centralised is not a problem at all. Having a limited number of people working on it greatly increases efficiency and as it is open source, plenty of people are looking over their shoulders to see whether they are doing the right thing. I don't see much incentive for creating malicious code.
* Both the miners and core developers wield much power over the direction Bitcoin is going. Sure, there are only so much things they can do before the community at large starts to boycott new versions of the software. The most important thing keeping the miners in place though is the reward they are receiving from mining. Satoshi created a system with the right incentives in place and so far this has worked very well. Miners rely on Bitcoin for their income and even if they sell all of them directly or through future contracts, they will in the end benefit from a higher Bitcoin price. Anything they do that puts the Bitcoin security in jeopardy, even if it creates massive profits in the short term, will cause them damage in the long run. This is what keeps Bitcoin safe and why I remain confident so far.

@_date: 2014-08-19 10:25:43
All right, my analysis of where Bitcoin stands right now:
* We're currently in a phase where the media and the general public have lost Bitcoin out of sight, which means that unlike last year, good or interesting news isn't rewarded with an influx of new users. Meanwhile some large businesses have embraced Bitcoin, as it is inexpensive for them to do so.
* However, adoption amongst consumers is trailing. I have high hopes that Circle will turn this around by making Bitcoin more accessible and actively trying to increase adoption through marketing. This could all take while though.
* All of this doesn't matter though, since I don't believe that consumer adoption is the key to success for Bitcoin in this stage. Before the year 2000 only a limited number of the population was using the internet. Yet a company like Amazon was able to build something great since their business model allowed them to undercut traditional book stores.
* What we need right now are businesses who are using Bitcoin to cut costs, undercut their competitors and create market share. I'm seeing opportunities in remittances, but there are plenty of industries where Bitcoin can make a difference. Many of these are business to business and don't require wide scale adoption amongst consumers.

Ah, but that is the beauty of it, this is not a change. 1 BTC or 1 bitcoin can remain the same thing as the media have called it the last year (and given all the media attention, the public is at least somewhat familiar with it). You only introduce a 'new' unit, which initially can be used by financial systems which are only able to handle to digits behind the decimal point anyway. The only thing people have to remember when coming across 1 XBT, is that it is worth a millionth of 1 BTC.

This is true, Bitcoin is getting better at a rapid pace. However, to really win vast amounts of consumers who have little incentive to switch from payments systems which already function reasonably well, a lot more is needed.

Since I bought bitcoins some 16 months ago, I have remained a permabull. I believe Bitcoin is a very powerful technology which serves many real-world purposes, not necessarily limited to B2C but mainly B2B. The creation of a currency which is global and can't be counterfeited is a unique event which will have long term impact.
 
There are a few risk factors, which either may delay or completely stop Bitcoin adoption. I am certainly not going to say I know exactly what is going to happen with Bitcoin, but I can imagine several scenarios and make an assessment how likely each scenario is and what future price per Bitcoin would go with each scenario.
 
From this I have calculated an expected value for Bitcoin, adjust this for risks and compare this with other types of assets. At a total value of 8 billion dollars, I believe it is still undervalued for the long term.

I wouldn't recommend formatting the offline computer after you've made the wallet. **Be aware that far more coins are lost due to people losing their keys rather than them being stolen.** If you only have a backup on a USB stick then you run a high risk of losing your keys.
 
A safer method would be to encrypt the offline computer (which can be done by installing Ubuntu on it for example) and then print a wallet backup on a physical piece of paper, or simply write down the keys (or root) if you don't have a printer. In case your computer is stolen or someone gains physical access, they can't do anything because of the encryption.
 
Also, use a program like Armory or Electrum which enable you to create a deterministic wallet which is much safer because you won't lose keys due to your coins being sent to a change address.

People with different types of personalities react differently towards a changing society. I guess most people in this particular subreddit are comfortable with new technology, so we are somewhat ahead (and many of us have done quite well financially as a result of this). 
 
There will be plenty more people though who will only start using Bitcoin once it's a lot easier to work with, and then there are many people who will never use it at all, the same way there are still people around without access to the internet. 
However, I certainly do not fear Bitcoin will pass if we don't get enough people on board right now. Bitcoin as a technology offers a wide range of benefits and possibilities for businesses and I think we will see the most progress in the B2B market. It's simply too useful for the world to ignore and as I also happen to believe that Bitcoin is incredibly robust, I am convinced that given enough time it will succeed.

The Netherlands.

That's why you shouldn't protect your paper wallet with a password, it kind of defeats the purpose (keep in mind paper wallets are also a way of making sure your bitcoins don't vanish in case you get hit by a bus).

* Bitstamp is under fire today, though at this point it's unclear whether this is simply a minor support / PR failure or that their switch to Raiffeisen introduced more serious problem. Meanwhile the Chinese exchanges are in the offensive and try to gain customers outside China.

Obviously any B2B solution would have to find a solution for volatility, usually this can be achieved by quickly exchanging bitcoins and hedging the difference. 
One of the things I'm imagining is a cheaper payroll solution. I have no clue what it would cost today if you have a small start-up in Silicon Valley to pay freelancers in Europe or China, but I can imagine it's not free when using a regular bank. A Bitcoin company aimed at paying employees or freelancers abroad could send the money using Bitcoin and exchanging them for Euros or Yuan. The start-up and their employees don't need to know the money is sent through Bitcoin, as long as it's faster and cheaper.

She also describes her father as a man who worked all hours, from before the family rose in the morning to late into the night. "He would keep his office locked and we would get into trouble if we touched his computer," she recalls. "He was always expounding on politics and current events. He loved new and old technology. He built his own computers and was very proud of them."
Around 2000, Nakamoto and Grace separated, though they have never divorced. They moved back to New Jersey with their five children and Nakamoto worked as a software engineer for the Federal Aviation Administration in New Jersey in the wake of the September 11 attacks, doing security and communications work, says Mitchell.
"It was very secret," she says. "He left that job sometime in 2001 and I don't think he's had a steady job since."
When the FAA contract ended, Nakamoto moved back to Temple City, where for the rest of that decade things get hazy about what kind of work he undertook.
Ever since Bitcoin rose to prominence there has been a hunt for the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Did he act alone or was he working for the government? Bitcoin has been linked to everything from the National Security Agency to the International Monetary Fund.
Yet, in a world where almost every big Silicon Valley innovation seems to erupt in lawsuits over who thought of it first, in the case of Bitcoin the founder has remained conspicuously silent for the past five years.
"I could see my dad doing something brilliant and not accepting the greater effect of it," says Ilene Mitchell, who works for Partnerships for Student Achievement in Beaverton, Ore. "But I honestly don't see him being straight about it. Any normal person would be all over it. But he's not totally a normal person."
Nakamoto's middle brother, Tokuo Nakamoto, who lives near his brother and mother, in Duarte, Calif., agrees. "He is very meticulous in what he does, but he is very afraid to take himself out into the media, so you will have to excuse him," he says.
Characteristics of Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin founder, that dovetail with Dorian S. Nakamoto, the computer engineer, are numerous. Those working most closely with Bitcoin's founder noticed several things: he seemed to be older than the other Bitcoin developers. And he worked alone.
"He didn't seem like a young person and he seemed to be influenced by a lot of people in Silicon Valley," says Nakamoto's Finnish protégé, Martti Malmi. Andresen concurs: "Satoshi's style of writing code was old-school. He used things like reverse Polish notation."
In addition, the code was not always terribly neat, another sign that Nakamoto was not working with a team that would have cleaned up the code and streamlined it.
"Everyone who looked at his code has pretty much concluded it was a single person," says Andresen. "We have rewritten roughly 70 percent of the code since inception. It wasn't written with nice interfaces. It was like one big hairball. It was incredibly tight and well-written at the lower level but where functions came together it could be pretty messy."
Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 online proposal also hints at his age, with the odd reference to "disk space" - something that hasn't been an issue since the last millennium - and older research citations of contemporaries' work going back to 1957.
The Bitcoin code is based on a network protocol that's been established for decades. Its brilliance is not so much in the code itself, says Andresen, but in the design, which unites functions to reach multiple ends. The punctuation in the proposal is also consistent with how Dorian S. Nakamoto writes, with double spaces after periods and other format quirks.
In the debate between those who claim Nakamoto writes curiously "flawless English" for a Japanese man and those who contend otherwise, writing under both names can swerve wildly between uppercase and lowercase, full spellings and abbreviations, proper English and slang.
In his correspondences and writings, it has widely been noted that Satoshi Nakamoto alternates between British and American spellings - and, depending on his audience, veers between highly abbreviated verbiage and a more formal, polished style. Grace Mitchell says her husband does the same.
Dorian S. Nakamoto's use of English, she says, was likely influenced by his lifelong interest in collecting model trains, many of which he imported from England as a teenager while he was still learning English.
Mitchell suspects Nakamoto's initial interest in creating a digital currency that could be used anywhere in the world may have stemmed from his frustration with bank fees and high exchange rates when he was sending international wires to England to buy model trains. "He would always complain about that," she says. "I would not say he writes flawless English. He will pick up words and mix the spellings."
Eric, Nakamoto's oldest son from his first marriage, says he remains torn over whether his father is the founder of Bitcoin, noting that messages from the latter appear more "concise" and "refined than that of my father's."
Perhaps the most compelling parallel between the two Nakamotos are their professional skill sets and career timeframes. Andresen says Satoshi Nakamoto told him about how long it took him to develop Bitcoin - a span that falls squarely into Dorian S. Nakamoto's job lapse starting in 2001. "Satoshi said he'd been working on Bitcoin for years before he launched it," Andresen says. "I could see the original code taking at least two years to write. He had a revelation that he had solved something no one had solved before."
Satoshi Nakamoto's three-year silence also dovetails with health issues suffered by Dorian S. Nakamoto in the past few years, his family says. "It has been hard, because he suffered a stroke several months ago and before that he was dealing with prostate cancer," says his wife, who works as a critical-care nurse in New Jersey. "He hasn't seen his kids for the past few years."
She has been unable to get Nakamoto to speak with her about whether he was the founder of Bitcoin. Eric Nakamoto says his father has denied it. Tokuo and Arthur Nakamoto believe their brother will leave the truth unconfirmed.
"Dorian can just be paranoid," says Tokuo. "I cannot get through to him. I don't think he will answer any of these questions to his family truthfully."
Of course, none of this puts to rest the biggest question of all - the one that only Satoshi Nakamoto himself can answer: What has kept him from spending his hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin, which he reaped when he launched the currency years ago? According to his family both he - and they - could really use the money.
Andresen says if Nakamoto is as concerned about maintaining his anonymity as he remembers the answer might be simple: He does not want to participate in the Bitcoin madness. "If you come out as the leader of Bitcoin, now you have to make appearances and presentations and comments to the press and that didn't really fit with Satoshi's personality," he says. "He didn't really want to lead it anymore. He was pretty intolerant to incompetence. And he also realized the project would go on without him."
On the other hand, it is possible Nakamoto simply lost the private security keys to unlock his Bitcoin and cash in on his riches. Andresen, however, says he doubts it. "He was too disciplined," he says.
If Nakamoto ever sells his Bitcoin fortune, he would likely have to do so at a legitimate Bitcoin bank or exchange, which would not only give away his identity but alert everyone from the IRS to the FBI of his movements. While Bitcoin lets its users conduct transactions anonymously, all transactions can be viewed transparently online - and everyone is watching Nakamoto's Bitcoin to see if he spends it, says Andresen.
For his part, Andresen says he is inclined to respect Nakamoto's anonymity. "When programmers get together, we don't talk about who Satoshi Nakamoto is," he says. "We talk about how we should have invested in more Bitcoin. I mean, we're curious about it, but honestly, we really don't care."
Calling the possibility her father could also be the father of Bitcoin "flabbergasting," Ilene Mitchell says she isn't surprised her father would choose to stay under cover if he was the man behind this venture, especially as he is currently concerned about his health.
"He is very wary of government interference in general," she says. "When I was little, there was a game we used to play. He would say, 'Pretend the government agencies are coming after you.' And I would hide in the closet."

However I am also a pragmatist and have to accept we don't live in a libertarian utopia just yet, and we know right now nearly all western governments regulate the shit out of the financial industry, whether this is effective or not. We have to accept Bitcoin will become regulated, I don't see any realistic way this can be avoided. 
If we then see a regulator like Lawsky who takes the effort not only to reach out towards the Bitcoin community, but to actively ask us for feedback, I'm glad he seems to be a good guy. We might not agree with everything the DFS does, but so far this looks promising.

Perhaps you could focus on the possibility Bitcoin offers for charities, especially those operating internationally. The field where Bitcoin offers the greatest promise is sending money abroad, combine this with people either donating from around the world for a particular charitable cause, or people sending money to help others in third-world countries, and you have a very strong PR story to tell.
So far much criticism against Bitcoin has been that it facilitates criminals, lets turn this around and show how it actually benefits people in need of help! And of course while people in western nations, who already have stable currencies and protected bank accounts, sometimes fail to notice how Bitcoin could be useful to them, in countries without either of those it could actually be a way to get them connected with the global internet economy.

I was describing the person who reduced a complex technical debate to a political issue, trying to gain populist support for his own solution and when that failed made the most dramatic exit possible purposefully doing as much PR damage to Bitcoin as one could imagine, thereby overstating his own importance and grossly exaggerating the issue.
@_date: 2016-01-10 14:30:07
Agreed, given the controversial nature of this debate a conservative increase seems best for now. Ideally we would have had a long term solution ready by now, but as there isn't consensus as to what it should be a cautious approach seems most reasonable. 
Sure, it will be kicking the can down the road, but that seems a lesser evil compared to choosing a suboptimal long term solution we're going to be stuck with.

Yes, Satoshi could have easily mined some coins from a completely different machine or even bought a whole bunch from someone else. He would still be an early adopter and nobody would have noticed if he cashed it out.
 
There is an alternative though, it should be possible to mortgage the coins, as an early adopter could easily provide proof of ownership.
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:37:16
Core can definitely be blamed for underestimating the seriousness of the blocksize debate and not having a satisfactory approach or solution ready to take away concerns on this topic, before it erupted.
Mike Hearn however deviated too much from sticking to technical arguments in this discussion and used populist methods to gain support when he couldn't convince the core devs.
While he has gained massive support, he still wasn't able to convince the community at large, he decided to screw everyone by going out in the most immature way imaginable, purposefully trying to destroy Bitcoin by spreading outright lies such as overstating his own importance to the project and making unnecessarily grandiose claims about the severity of the issue.

Please, cut this crap. Neither Blockstream, nor one of the other Bitcoin businesses or any of the core developers is purposely trying to destroy Bitcoin or preventing useful improvements. 
There is disagreement about the exact nature of the problem and thus the solution and there are differing long-term visions for the project, which makes it so difficult to solve. However, I haven't seen ill intent and unless proven otherwise, I'm going to assume there isn't any.

    currencies today is that the miners who verify and record
    transactions on the public ledger need to be incentivized in
    some way. In the world of Bitcoin they&amp; paid in
    Bitcoins. You&amp; not building a currency system; how will
    Digital Asset incentivize miners to verify and record
    transactions that are part of your service?**


    about the question of managing motivation for transaction
    processing. The approach you describe is one approach that
    exists today, but there are entirely different protocols where
    the motivation of a network transaction processor, which is a
    less pejorative term for miner, could be to keep the network
    safe or functioning because they&amp; users. So you could
    imagine a world where you don&amp; have independent miners
    who are motivated by the financial return for their mining, but
    rather people who have invested in a shared utility who have an
    interest in it continuing to work because they are using it to
    do whatever it is they do for a living.
This sounds a lot like altcoin, perhaps a proof-of-stake one. What do you guys make of this?
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:16:33
Contrary to most people here I do believe it is entirely possible to create a separate blockchain which would have advantages over a regular shared database, as you've described. Perhaps there would even be specific advantages compared to the Bitcoin blockchain, at least as long as these aren't replicable with sidechains.
However, I do wonder if it would be a sane longterm strategy to pursue a separate blockchain. I can imagine how there would be a division between large banks developing and using their own proprietary blockchains and smaller banks and financial entities simply using the opensource, widely supported bitcoin blockchain. In the end I think the bitcoin blockchain definitely has the best odds.

I think it would be possible to make this transaction chain decentralised as well, so it would become a distributed cryptographically secured ledger. While a far cry from a 'true' trustless blockchain, it would still be an improvement over the current legacy systems used by banks. 
I wouldn't be surprised if blockchain becomes a household-name in ten, fifteen years, only then as a catch-all term for any sort of advanced financial technology. More or less the same way we use the term Internet to describe the World Wide Web and vice versa.

This isn't news at all. The rules on wealth taxes in the Netherlands are very clear, *anything* at all which has a certain value as an investment has to be declared if the total sum is above a certain threshold. It doesn't matter at all if this wealth is in shares, gold, digital currencies or a valuable collection of football cards. 
The tax office has already mentioned several years ago that bitcoins are no exemption to this rule and this year they've specifically clarified it on the tax form since apparently it can still be confusing to some people. The legal status of bitcoin doesn't change a bit though as it would be outside the jurisdiction of the tax office anyway.

Well you don't necessarily need a government to issue a currency to be used in third world countries, M-Pesa demonstrates that even a company as small as a telecom provider, in this case Vodafone, might be sufficient. I can imagine Bill Gates is aiming at a currency issued and controlled by Microsoft, which would work very well as long as you trust Microsoft not to become bankrupt or steal your money. 
The ultimate advantage Bitcoin has over other forms of digital currency is that it is inherently more robust than any centralised solution and better tested and backed by more hashing power than any other cryptocurrency. However, this advantage will only become fully apparent when other digital currencies fail dramatically.
@_date: 2015-02-17 08:38:21

That could be solved as well. If you receive a withdrawal notification you don't recognise and you are suddenly unable to log in, you could simply send a mail to the exchange during the time delay saying you didn't authorise the withdrawal. The exchange would then pause the withdrawal until all evidence is reviewed. Any suspicious activity would then easily be recognised (such as change of e-mail address, IP address which might be a TOR exit node, and so on).

I disagree and believe this idea could definitely work. Bitcoin merchants could use a 'central bank', albeit a voluntary one. Suppose one entity simply gathers a lot of bitcoins (and dollars, euros and other currencies) only to be used as a buffer in case the price fluctuates very rapidly.
 
The reasoning could be as follows: suppose I bought bitcoins in the morning at Bitstamp for $200 per coin. In the evening, when I want to make a purchase, Bitcoins are worth $220 per coin and I'm suddenly unable to buy the product I had my eyes on because of a lack of coins. This would be the last time I use Bitcoin. For the vendor this doesn't matter, as they have the option to receive payment in euros or dollars anyway.
 
A Central Bitcoin Bank could simply guarantee the price for a certain period, say 24 hours, and could be funded by exchanges or payment processors. This would in effect remove the volatility argument against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:28:54
The network effect. I honestly doubt it would be possible for a different and better cryptocurrency to overtake Bitcoin. I can't imagine which kind of features this currency would possess which are so superior that people would prefer it to Bitcoin, yet somehow cannot be adopted by Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin is build on consensus and if there exists a serious possibility that it would lose it's value due to people abandoning it for something better, consensus would dictate that Bitcoin should adopt those features. And as the Bitcoin core developers are some of the wealthiest Bitcoin owners I'm confident they'll act swiftly should any threat emerge.
The limited Bitcoin supply is also Satoshi's greatest trick. He realized that if the block reward would never end, there would always be a risk that Bitcoin users would prefer a deflationary altcoin since that would be more rewarding to it's miners and holders.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:23:08

Scepticism and rationality are the right tools to approach a thing like Bitcoin, so you are right on that point.
To answer your questions:
* In my opinion, Bitcoin is primarily beneficial in international trade. A good example might be Amazon selling goods to Europeans, or DealExtreme to Americans. Many people, especially in Europe, do not use credit cards and Bitcoin is a cheap and fast alternative.
* Probably not, but that doesn't have to be an issue. Bitcoin has it's worth as a store of value, not merely as a payment system for merchants and consumers to use.
* The network effect is very strong in money. Altcoins will have a tremendously difficult time catching up with Bitcoin, this includes potential institutionally backed coins. If a certain altcoin has a specific property which makes it better than Bitcoin, it will probably be adopted by Bitcoin itself before it becomes a threat.
* The value of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand and thus by consumer psychology. Right now, people give it value because they believe it might amount to something one day, although this confidence might rapidly deteriorate for whatever reason. One of Bitcoin's awesome properties is that it creates a positive feedback loop which makes it more valuable if more people use it.
 
I believe the greatest threats to Bitcoin are the scalability and the potential for clusters of miners to gain too much power. There might be various solutions, although this is still somewhat uncertain.
Edit: a word.

So if I understand correctly you have mined some bitcoins you'd like to sell? I assume you aren't in dire need of money right now so perhaps you could simply wait until you're 18 so you can legally sell them on an exchange. If you're lucky you got yourself a nice college fund.

It's worth mentioning that the chances someone types in a different, yet valid address are astronomically small. It's far more likely that mistyping the address results in the coins not being sent at all, so you could look up your mistake and try again.
 
Then there is of course the remote chance someone performs a man-in-the-middle attack and puts in his own bitcoin address (could happen when the invoice is sent by e-mail) but that should be fixed by the next version of the Bitcoin client, which supports Payment Protocol, so it's possible to verify if the address in the invoice really belongs to whoever you think it should belong to.

Some general advice to newcomers:
* If you're new to Bitcoin, don't mine, it won't be profitable.
* Protect your coins. Try Armory or Electrum and make a paper backup. 
* If you insist on keeping your coins on an exchange or in the wallet from Blockchain.info, use two-factor authentication.
* Do not use Brainwallets, these aren't secure.
* Never invest more than you are able to lose.

There is a fundamental reason the price is dropping, namely the loss of the Chinese market. However, a large part of the drop is explained by people wanting to get out now, hence the difference in price between the various markets. 
 
The same can be said about the price difference between Mt.Gox and Bitstamp the last six months. Bitcoins sold on Mt.Gox aren't fundamentally worth more than on Bitstamp, it's just the technical difficulties they are experiencing with withdrawals causing the prices to diverge.

Sorry for sounding condescending, this is not my intention. When I was younger I used to believe in one or two conspiracy theories as well and I did this convinced my opinion was based on rational thought. I learned however that in any case where there are many people, either from an official position or on their own account, claiming that something is not a conspiracy, they are usually right.
 
In case of 9/11, there would be too many people involved in the cover-up for it to be able to work. If you look at Watergate, where only a few people knew of the government corruption, it was exposed within a few years. The Manhattan Project was also something only a small number of people knew about and also in the context of the military and a global war, which the scientists involved desperately wanted to win.
 
To think that journalists in the media, editors at Popular Mechanics or scientists involved in the official reports on 9/11, would willingly either cover up the gross negligence in preventing the attacks or worse, the intentional murder of thousands of Americans, is completely irrational. Applying Occam's Razor to this, the official story of some terrorists doing this is a much, much simpler explanation.

I thought this was a great interview with someone who obviously understood Bitcoin. 
 
I don't mind the thing at the end where he said there is a risk if Bitcoin will ever honor the maximum of 21 million bitcoins because technically, he is absolutely right. The thing he either forgot to mention are doesn't understand as of yet, is that in reality, this risk is very remote. 
 
Miners and users alike would have to agree in an overwhelming majority that the cap is lifted, something I'm currently unable to imagine. But, if this whole issue is one of the worst scenarios that could succeed in the future, I'm very confident a brighter future is far more likely.

Oh I certainly think the war in Iraq was a strategic move made in the interest of American dominance in the Middle East. And the Bush administration certainly abused 9/11 to get support for their wars. I just don't think they had to orchestrate 9/11 themselves, the government is far to incompetent and divided to pull off something on that scale. If 9/11 wouldn't have happened they probably found some other bullshit reason to invade Iraq or some other country.

From the article:


So now the US government has over 27k bitcoins in it's possession. They'll probably do as told and liquidate them once the case is over, but is there a realistic scenario where they simply keep them or transfer them to some other department? 
 
If the case against DPR takes a few years and bitcoins would be worth a lot more than they are right now, I'm sure the department of treasury, among others, might take some interest. In the end this could even become a starting point for a much larger "US Government Bitcoin Fund".

It seems like you're not willing to invest in anything other than Bitcoin because you wouldn't be able to make your money back any other way. I get that. But for the love of God, please *invest* in Bitcoin rather than trying to game the market. You are up against bots, shrewd traders who *are* professionals looking out for fish like you to catch, and you simply cannot win by day trading. There is no such thing as a secret strategy which allows you to win anyway.
 
If you insist on buying Bitcoin, put them in a paper wallet. Better yet, use the fragmented backup feature from Armory so you can share the key with your sister. This will prevent you from selling in a panick *again*. 
And what was that anyway, why did you sell at $500 to "minimize your losses"? You looked at the charts, you're bullish on Bitcoin, why didn't you wait? So far Bitcoin recovered from every drop, did you really think it would stay below $500 forever? That doesn't even make sense.

We can, with some certainty, predict a few things about next year:
 
* We know that Overstock.com is going to use Bitcoin. It is reasonable to assume that a few other retailers, both online and offline, are going to accept Bitcoin as well. We've heard positive messages from a few retailers who are already accepting Bitcoin in the last couple of months so hopefully this will be a success for the big guys as well.
* More governments will come with guidelines on how to regulate Bitcoin, most importantly the United States Government. The senate hearings have been positive in tone, lets hope their regulations are also positive for the Bitcoin environment. 
* There is a lot to expect from a few of the Bitcoin start-ups who received money from the VC's and angels. Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle and several other companies received large sums of money which will not only be spend at improving their own products and services but on bringing Bitcoin to the public as well.
* Many people and companies have heard about Bitcoin in 2013. Many of those will not have made their mind up what to expect from it. It is entirely possible that with better access to buying bitcoins, more endorsements from large companies and influential individuals and more places to spend bitcoins, they will be convinced and start buying them.
* Most importantly, but hardest to predict: in the event of some disruptive economic news, such as the crisis in Cyprus last year or perhaps something even bigger, Bitcoin might become a very attractive safe haven for certain people. Before 2013, they didn't know about its existence, in 2014 they might consider it their only hope.

Sending 100 CAD from Vancouver to China by Western Union is going to cost you at least 10 CAD. Needless to say, this could be done cheaper by using the Bitcoin ATM. The recipients are able to convert their bitcoins to Yuan easily at one of the country's many exchanges.
Edit: it helps of course that the price at BTCChina is usually a couple percent above the Bitstamp price. And using the Bitcoin ATM to send money to China is much faster.

I completely agree with this. To be fair, as a payment system Bitcoin is at this point simply not mature enough. It's too difficult for people to buy bitcoins and too difficult to keep them safe. Besides that, many people rather keep their coins as savings rather than spend them on goods. The only consumer application I can imagine where Bitcoin adds value is online gambling.
 
I believe Bitcoin as an asset class or tool to be used by businesses to transfer money around the world has a much better chance to succeed in the short term. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:12:29
Agreed, and it's a good thing to see that despite the recent downturn in price, volumes are still very large when measured in dollars. Any player to enter the exchange market could easily make a lot of money, so it's a great business case for Western Union or Moneygram for example.

The green line on the left is made up of all buy orders for Bitcoin, the red line on the right all the sell orders. Right now at $900 the red line is quite steep, that means someone placed a large sell order at that price. For Bitcoin to get above $900, either the whole order has to be bought, or the seller has to pull the order from the market.

There is a good reason for Satoshi to remain hidden. The legal implications of creating a new currency aren't completely clear, so by remaining anonymous he prevented being lifted from his bed by the FBI in case everything went wrong. Other than that, if Bitcoin succeeds he might become quite wealthy and attract unwanted attention.
 
The code itself is completely open source so it's basically irrelevant who created it or why it was created, it works and we can see how it works.

As the person who posted the first mention of the IMF Super Tax I have to agree that this may be slightly off-topic as it doesn't have a direct Bitcoin reference, but since the implications of this may very well be on the same level as Cyprus was, I assumed it was at least worth to be mentioned. 
This surpasses general financial news as even rumours that such a tax is possible, could create an unprecedented flight of capital which would certainly be beneficial for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin tables and tournaments are a great way to start with gambling but eventually it's even better to simply integrate Bitcoin as a payment system for both depositing and withdrawing money from the gambling site.
 
Unfortunately gambling is somewhat frowned upon by a part of the Bitcoin community (shame on Bitpay for not allowing gambling sites) as the offline gambling industry in the US have successfully outlawed online gambling by their puppets in congress, but in many other parts of the world it's still a legitimate business. 
I believe gambling could be one of those industries where Bitcoin can really make a difference as it's quite international and all about getting costs down. Thanks for doing this!

Good to see the Ebay/PayPal rumours have reached the press.
The obvious solution to the charge back issue is that these are by default not allowed when dealing in virtual currency and that an automated mechanism is in place to check the blockchain whether the transaction was successful. I mean, PayPal already knows how much bitcoins have been sold, all they need to ask is which addresses were used in the transaction. Only when things don't add up their fraud team should have to take a look at it.
And of course PayPal could simply start by teaming up with trusted Bitcoin exchanges and never deal with individual Bitcoin traders at all.

One of the most common forms of criticism against Bitcoin come when people compare it to regular money. They treat Bitcoin like it's a finished product and note the obvious drawbacks. In order to understand Bitcoin, experts have to realise:
* Bitcoin is essentially a transport mechanism for wealth. It is cheaper and faster than competing systems and isn't bound by national borders.
* Bitcoin is a protocol, not a finished consumer product. Many of it's flaws can be fixed by adding layers on top of the core network.
* Bitcoin is volatile, so for the love of God, don't use it to quote prices. Instead, use the payment and transport mechanisms of Bitcoin and quote the price in whichever currency you are most familiar with.
* Bitcoin is in a bubble right now, though that doesn't mean it will automatically fail. Many successful companies, commodities or other assets have been in bubbles before and although there are corrections and crashes, they often recover.
* Bitcoin doesn't have to be perfect, it only needs to stay ahead of the competition. Right now, it's light years ahead  and gaining critical mass. Unless a fatal technical flaw is discovered it is definitely going to change the world.

Any proper economist would tell you that prices can't be predicted. I'm not an economist though so I can tell you that my prediction would be anywhere between $100 and $100,000 for this year, with $10,000 being a reasonable target.
 
The USD price for a bitcoin depends mainly on the number of people who are aware the currency exists and understand how it works combined with the trust they have in the system. As Bitcoin is in the limelight this year many more people will learn about it and as work is done to improve the infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin, it's image will gradually improve as well.
 
Right now there is around $32,000 billion stored in tax havens. All bitcoins together are currently worth slightly over $1bn. There is room for growth.

It doesn't reduce the threat of bank accounts being hacked, but regular consumer banks are lazy and if they see a lot of stolen money being transferred to certain accounts owned by Bitstamp and located in Slovenia, their knee-jerk reaction will be to block all transactions to these accounts, thus effectively blocking Bitstamp.
 
This happened to me a month ago when sending money to Mt.Gox' account in Poland, my bank blocked the transaction only to approve it once I've convinced them that it was a legitimate transaction. As banks have to cover the costs of all stolen money themselves, they have an incentive to block transactions to Bitcoin exchanges.
 
I'm not saying this is fair or people don't have a right to anonymous Bitcoin accounts, only that working together with banks and law enforcement will be good for Bitcoin adoption.

This is a great move by Mt.Gox and I believe Bitstamp and other exchanges should follow suit immediately. Requiring all their users to be verified reduces the threat these exchanges pose to regular banks when accounts of their customers are hacked and thieves send money towards the exchanges. Eventually, this will ensure Bitcoin mainstream adoption.

We are now in a period where the Bitcoin ecosystem is catching up with the high expectations as shown in the rapid appreciation earlier this year.

Well although arguments about Bitcoin only being virtual are not very convincing, many people who own bitcoins (myself included) do no have a very diversified investment portfolio, unless you've sold a sizeable portion recently. This is to be expected when one of your assets appreciates by 7000% in a year. 
The same would go if you made a lot of money with your own business, but all your wealth is tied up in there. When you own dollars or euros you are at least somewhat insured and it would be even better to own stocks, bonds or commodities as well.
Buy and hold is a risky strategy because your coins could be stolen or lost or Bitcoin could somehow fail completely, but since the chance of such a thing happening is small in my view, I take the risk to leave most of my assets in Bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:17:24
This is a very good question you asked and not one many people thoroughly understand. Plenty of people tend to think the mining pool operators, the core developers or even the Bitcoin Foundation hold much power over the network, while in reality it's quite balanced with the end-users as probably the strongest group.
 
And although it's certainly possible that many core features can be changed at some time, the distributed power creates a very conservative, risk-averse system. Compare this for example to the central banks of the world which were mostly given power on a conservative mandate, which they completely abandoned over the course of a few recessions.

From what I understand Chinese businesses are still allowed to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, though I am not sure if this means they are required to have them traded for RMB (I believe they are still allowed to receive Bitcoins). It seems they are certainly not allowed to price their products in Bitcoin.
 
This could be solved by any Chinese equivalent of Bitpay, who transfers bitcoins to RMB. However, would such a company itself be allowed to hold regular bank accounts? As long as Chinese banks are still able to deal with clients who deal with bitcoins, nothing much changes.
This is a blow to the emergence of Bitcoin as a payment network in China. However, as long as the exchanges remain open Chinese individuals have now been given the green light to use bitcoins as an alternative asset to store their savings in or use it as an intermediate for buying dollars.

Instead of focusing on Charlie Munger, who is obviously somehow unable to understand Bitcoin, which he honestly admitted, the news in this is that this might be the first time we hear from Bill Gates on this subject.

If that would be possible to work in practice, that would be even better. But decentralization can also be achieved by having many 'centralized' exchanges, competing in a free market, as long as they don't mess things up like some of the Bitcoin exchanges are doing right now.

We can, with some certainty, predict a few things about next year:
* We know that Overstock.com is going to use Bitcoin. It is reasonable to assume that a few other retailers, both online and offline, are going to accept Bitcoin as well. We've heard positive messages from a few retailers who are already accepting Bitcoin in the last couple of months so hopefully this will be a success for the big guys as well.
* More governments will come with guidelines on how to regulate Bitcoin, most importantly the United States Government. The senate hearings have been positive in tone, lets hope their regulations are also positive for the Bitcoin environment.
* There is a lot to expect from a few of the Bitcoin start-ups who received money from the VC's and angels. Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle and several other companies received large sums of money which will not only be spend at improving their own products and services but on bringing Bitcoin to the public as well.
* Many people and companies have heard about Bitcoin in 2013. Many of those will not have made their mind up what to expect from it. It is entirely possible that with better access to buying bitcoins, more endorsements from large companies and influential individuals and more places to spend bitcoins, they will be convinced and start buying them.
* With a bit of luck the Winklevii Bitcoin ETF can be launched, the Fortress Fund is coming, 2014 might be the year Wall Street enters the market.
* Most importantly, but hardest to predict: in the event of some disruptive economic news, such as the crisis in Cyprus last year or perhaps something even bigger, Bitcoin might become a very attractive safe haven for certain people. Before 2013, they didn't know about its existence, in 2014 they might consider it their only hope.

I wouldn't jump to conclusions here. There have been positive news items in Chinese state controlled press, but I've heard more than a few people from China say in this particular forum that this isn't the same thing as a full endorsement from the state itself.

The thing with known conspiracies from the past is that it is very unlikely large secrets which involve many people can be kept from the public for a long time. In case of the 9/11 conspiracy, it was thoroughly debunked by the scientific community. I know this won't convince you as you probably had this discussion many times before and usually people like you have made their mind up already. 
 
In many ways believing in a conspiracy is based on faith. Against all empirical evidence and contrary to Occam's Razor, people tend to believe in some huge secret because the simple explanation (the WTC was destroyed by a bunch of fanatical Muslims hijacking planes) is rejected by the mind. 
This is a well researched phenomenon in psychology and often people believing in one conspiracy tend to believe in many other conspiracies. Most of these conspiracy theories aren't falsifiable and therefore, at least to Karl Popper, unscientific.

Sure, a solution like Multibit or the original Bitcoin client are quite safe for storing relatively small amounts of Bitcoin.

And that's often the go-to strategy with people believing in conspiracies, trying to suck people they discuss with into their world of fallacies and endless repeating of arguments already debunked by the scientific community.

I believe this is a fair analysis. Although I've bought all my bitcoins on MtGox last year, I wouldn't even think of selling them there, not even for a 20% premium, as I know I would probably have to wait weeks to see if I'll receive my money. I'm sure more people feel this way and are even willing to pay a premium to convert their fiat to bitcoin and get the hell out of there.
 
As usual, MtGox isn't prepared (I know they are trying to get a deal with a European bank, but they should have done that years ago). Once all the fiat and bitcoins have fled from Japan we might finally be done with this bunch of amateurs.

Hi Matt, thanks for your enthusiasm and reaching out to the Bitcoin community here! In the broadcast the other people (especially the old guy) had trouble understanding what Bitcoin is and why it's worth is increasing so rapidly. Perhaps you can try to explain it this way:
* Bitcoin is a transport system for value. It is cheaper, faster and more versatile than any of its competitors. It stands to regular money like e-mail stands to postal mail.
* Bitcoin is just this protocol, it is not finished yet. Its possibilities are quite diverse, but we have yet to figure out how to use it exactly.
* It is not a grown up currency like the dollar. Its volatility  makes it impractical as a unit of account right now, but for merchants this doesn't matter since they can choose to receive whichever currency they're most familiar with.
* Because it is so much more useful as a future currency, payment system or store of value than its competitors, the price is increasing rapidly as more and more people understand its implications. This was likely to happen from the start and will probably go on for a long time.

Mining bitcoins has become a professional business. I understand the attraction to consumers who think it's an exciting way of getting 'free' money, but just as with the Gold Rush, most miners make preciously little money compared to their effort, blinded by the wealth the very first miners gathered. 
 
Right now ASICMINER is working on impressive rigs with immersion cooling, and elsewhere in China mining centers are build on an industrial scale with millions in investments. There is absolutely no way for an individual to compete with these guys, buying mining hardware is an absolute waste of money and energy. 
 
If you want bitcoins, buy them.

* Bitcoin can be quite cumbersome to use safely for non-technical users. 
* Many people avoid spending bitcoins hoping they will be worth much more in the future. It feels like you're ruining your lifetime savings.
* A consortium of banks and/or governments could effectively stop Bitcoin in the western world by refusing to open accounts for any person or company involved in Bitcoin.
 
Solutions: 
* Insured Bitcoin wallets. If you lose bitcoins due to being hacked but can prove you took at least minimal safety procedures, the wallet provider will get you new coins. Full-fledged Bitcoin banks were the coins are stored at the bank, insured and able to receive interest are also something to look forward to as an extra option next to regular wallets.
* By making it easier to buy bitcoins you could simply use dollars or euros from your regular income to buy stuff online, only the step were the transaction takes place is handled by the Bitcoin protocol. A service where the payment processor (or some other entity) protects customers from volatility could also work.
* The Bitcoin community needs to lobby with governments to convince them it's not a threat to them but can generate lots of economic activity. Bitcoin needs to reach a certain amount of popularity for people to protest when banks try to strangle Bitcoin and convince other banks to still accept Bitcoin businesses.

Mainstream economists prefer a mild inflation, although I think mild deflation might not be that bad. We see deflation occurring in many markets the last few decades and most of these markets are booming (think about mobile phones for instance). Since economics isn't an exact science, I think it's too uncertain what the effects of a prolonged global deflation will be in a modern economy.
 
More importantly though, the built-in deflation is absolutely necessary for Bitcoin:
* The total energy cost of Bitcoin mining should in the long run approach the total value of all transactions plus the block reward. With a rapidly diminishing block reward, the total amount of energy spent approaches the total value of all transaction costs, thereby creating a perfect balance.
* If the block rewards would continue, Bitcoin was at risk of being taken over by an altcoin which didn't have built-in inflation.

I disagree, if she ~~is~~ isn't a risk-averse investor she might be very comfortable in investing 5k in bitcoin. It's not the end of the world if she ends up losing it and personally I do not think the chance that it will be *completely* worthless one day that big, as long as the coins are safely stored away.
 
To OP: just find yourself a good exchange, perhaps Kraken.com or Bitstamp.net, if available. Buying roughly 10 bitcoins won't be a big deal for the market.


Well make sure you are then before you buy any.
 
Edit: all right I messed up, I meant to say *not* risk-averse, so risk-seeking.

No of course someone who is an investor for his living would never put 20% of his portfolio in a high-risk asset. But when you don't depend on your savings to provide you with an income, in the end it doesn't matter that much if you have 25k or 20k in the bank.

Bitpay seems to be setting the standard for the emerging Bitcoin industry, they are doing absolutely great. If I recall correctly they were one of the first to receive large amounts of funds from venture capitalists and they seem to be investing this well. They are expanding rapidly and so far I haven't heard a bad word about them.
 
Unfortunately, some companies in the industry neglect investing in their infrastructure and customer service, although making enough money, hurting the whole Bitcoin project with their incompetence. Good to see there are competent companies working on Bitcoin as well.
One point of criticism though, their website could use a makeover. The overly happy bald guy is creeping me out.

Well that would be difficult, the same way it's difficult to determine the exact value of any currency. You could compare the dollar to gold for example, but that doesn't do it justice since the gold market has its own dynamics which determine its price. The best way would probably be to compare it to a basket of various goods and commodities, like inflation is calculated nowadays.

Sure but that doesn't mean you can pretty much randomly draw lines on a chart expecting that you can predict the price with it. The price path of Bitcoin mostly follows fundamental reasons such as the attention it's getting in the media or the course the American and Chinese governments are taking. You simply can't reliably predict this in a chart. What you can do however, is think of different possible scenario's and try to go from there.

Seriously, do we have to do this? I don't give a fuck about this whole guy, or about Alex Waters or Yifu Guo. Kashmir Hill wrote some great articles on Bitcoin so please let her out of this childish bullshit.
 
Let's look at this Coin Validation thing from a technical point of view:
* The Blockchain allows thorough analysis of money flows. This is a good thing if you want to catch someone who stole your coins but a bad thing for privacy. There are however many technical solutions available to solve this, so I don't know what the fuzz is about anyway. Bitcoin by design allows analysis, let's take that as a given and not attack people who want to exploit this.
* From a legal or political point of view this case is more interesting. I can imagine that regulators demand bitcoins to be tracked if they allow the banking-exchange corridor to remain open. As long as tainted coins can be untainted by some independent party, this might be fine. Yes, there will be some centralisation, but that is inevitable. The fundamentals for Bitcoin as a decentralised open source protocol haven't changed and will not change, that is the only thing that matters.
 
Edit: don't get me wrong, I think blacklisting coins is certainly a bad idea. But it's not a bad thing to look at technical solutions to track ransomware operators. I'm only saying this debate should focus on technical matters and not on the people involved.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:18:57
It's a piece of paper which holds every information you will ever need to retrieve your coins. This could be the private keys to the addresses themselves or a seed which allows programs to construct all private keys which can be derived from a deterministic wallet. 
 
The latter case is preferable since it prevents coins from being lost after sent to a change address (this is something most Bitcoin clients do by default, so every address is only used once. It can be confusing though). 
 
A paper wallet in important to have because people have a habit of forgetting their password or because their computer crashes. It's also useful in case something bad happens to you and your heirs want access to your stash of internet money.
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:34:59
For the miners trust in the Bitcoin network is key. Their business (and often their savings) depend on Bitcoin having value and once the trust of the end users is in jeopardy the market will react negatively and it's going to cost them. For instance, technically it's easy for a couple of the mining pool operators to form a cartel and use a Bitcoin variant which awards them more coins, but the value of those new coins would plummet immediately. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:20:59
Yes, you could use them as cold storage. They do not expire however, nor will the wallet be deleted.
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:06:34
This could be true although I am not certain about the timing. I think Wall Street at some point will get involved, if only because they have trading desks who can make a profit on playing the volatility, but more so because they have clients who want in. 
 
However, this is already the case right now and Wall Street is probably waiting because of the uncertain regulatory environment. If I recall correctly we are still waiting what the response will be from the senate hearings. They could take over New Yorks plan and make one specific nationwide Bitcoin license, or they could stick to the current situation and have every company register at state level as a money transmitter. 
 
Depending on this outcome, and I am certainly no expert on American law, it might take another month or perhaps a few months before the hedge funds and banks are able to directly invest in Bitcoin (investing in the start ups is clearly the domain of the VC's and angels).
Most importantly though, the Bitcoin market valued at $10B is very small by Wall Street standards and I have every reason to assume they are going in *eventually*. It is hard to predict when this will happen, but if it does, we will enter a new phase of very rapid price appreciation. Every day until then is another opportunity for individuals to get a front seat for next to nothing.

Well, there are many people who really suck at using computers and if there is only the slightest risk they might end up deleting their life savings by accident, it's a good reason for them to ignore Bitcoin in the first place.

A solution might be that deleting your wallet or sending large amounts of money require the customer to authorize the transaction by phone, just as a safety precaution.

Because the market for mobile phones (as many other technology markets) has been in a state of constant deflation since its inception.

Good to see the Ebay/PayPal rumours have reached the press.
 
The obvious solution to the charge back issue is that these are by default not allowed when dealing in virtual currency and that an automated mechanism is in place to check the blockchain whether the transaction was successful. I mean, PayPal already knows how much bitcoins have been sold, all they need to ask is which addresses were used in the transaction. Only when things don't add up their fraud team should have to take a look at it.
 
And of course PayPal could simply start by teaming up with trusted Bitcoin exchanges and never deal with individual Bitcoin traders at all.
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:46:53
 
Edit: ok too easy. I think you have to look at what constitutes money and which characteristics are important. If you look at the history of money you'll see that many items without any practical value of itself have been used as money because they were easy to transport, divide, durable and scarce enough. As gold has all of these properties it was the currency of choice for most of mankind's history, only to be replaced when it became impractical to be stored, carried and protected. Bitcoin has all the qualities gold has but with the added value that it is extremely easy and cheap to transport around the world. It's inherent scarcity makes it superior to fiat money.
 
Think of it this way: imagine a neolithic village where rare shells are used as a form of money. Within the village this system works fine, but when trading with outsiders it has to be converted to some other form of shells as they don't see value in yours. Then one day a stranger comes along with this yellow shining metal, which he claims is better than your shells. The elders dismiss him as a charlatan, but some of the town's younger guys, traders perhaps, remember the villagers at the other side of the mountain use the same metal. Before you know it, a better form of money has replaced the old system.

@_date: 2013-12-06 10:12:03
I've read through the article and Steven Englanders analysis was certainly one of the more informed I came across in a long time. He addresses the following points:
* The volatility in Bitcoin might be detrimental to its acceptance as a payment system.
* In a future where Bitcoin miners become the guardians of money creation instead of central bankers with a mandate it is still uncertain whether this will result in a more stable financial system.
* This is really interesting: Bitcoin could be a very useful tool for reserve managers looking for an alternative for the USD. So far Bitcoin is too small and volatile, but if this can be overcome they have a strong incentive to move in. Note that this is a point missed in the analysis by Bank of America and Wedbush, but could ultimately be more important in terms of price appreciation.
* He is somewhat sceptic on Bitcoins first mover advantage, noting that the marginal costs of creating a copy are very low (are you listening ?). 
* Bitcoin is only just starting, though even if the market continues to grow exponentially it is not certain this growth will be sustained in the future. There are still systemic risks involved.
* If it is a bubble, it might be best to consider it a high risk, high return investment with the added value of creating good conversational material.
* From his conclusion: **"Market acceptance of alternative currencies now looks to be growing a lot faster than the pace at which the supply of Bitcoin and Bitcoin wannabees is expanding the Internet money supply."** In other words, this could be an awesome bet to make, although there are still serious risks involved.
 
I disagree with him on the network effect, as I believe virtual currency service providers like Bitpay have an incentive to stick to one currency, and Bitcoins rapid appreciation might be the best way to get more people involved. I also doubt it is possible to create an attractive alternative from scratch without the volatility. On the whole it was an excellent analysis and he addressed many legitimate points.

The chart takes the price into account but not the price change. That wouldn't make sense as you have to compare the costs of mining to the cost of obtaining bitcoins in the market at any point. The whole purpose of mining on an industrial scale is to allow you to bring the energy consumption down but even then I think it might as well be more profitable to simply buy bitcoins.

I'm not that satisfied with my job either so once my Bitcoins are worth enough to make a living out of it, I'm gone. Ideally, I would have diversified my Bitcoin holdings in such a way that even in the remote chance Bitcoins become totally worthless (or, I would lose them) I would have enough fiat in the bank to be able to retire anyway.
 
Alternatively, I could quit my job now and start working within the Bitcoin ecosystem (although I have no idea where to find a job where my knowledge of Bitcoin becomes useful, but you've seem to sorted that out already). Then, if Bitcoin becomes worthless, I would still have a good resumé and would be able to find a new job.
 
My advice to you would be to quit your job, start your own business and do whatever it is you're doing with Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin fails, your career wouldn't be harmed.

If you really want to create something durable you should consider etching paper wallets from Armory on stainless steel. The advantage there is that you can include the whole seed, so unlike a wallet with only one private key, upon spending it people won't lose their coins due to carelessly deleting their change address (which unfortunately happens quite often).

Well yeah but I guess this can be solved when the transaction page, which is in controlled by PayPal, shows both addresses to buyer and seller and they both have to confirm these are correct. The current practice where buyer and seller have direct contact between each other should have to be changed then, they only have to communicate with PayPal.

You are completely right, day trading is the fastest way to lose your coins. Buy and hold is a much safer strategy.
 
I made the same mistake when I panicked after the price crashed rapidly back in January, after reaching $17, and ended up losing 20% of my total. I felt so bad that I decided to put even more money in Bitcoin to buy back what I lost and then some. I am quite satisfied with that decision these days.

I bought between $10 and $20 and although I was certainly not the first to show up at the party, I bought quite a few in short time. I also [wrote about it]( in When I came across Bitcoin the things I found most interesting were its decentralised network, which gives it strength, and the elegant way in which the double-spending problem was solved. I still think that there is a good chance Bitcoin will change the world and is going to increase in value in the years to come. More details in the following shameless self-plug:

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, not something controlled by the US Government. If they take a negative stance towards Bitcoin it will surely be bad for business, but I doubt it will affect the price much in the long run.

This is very interesting. In your view, it is impossible for some guys in a pre-9/11 world to get on some planes, storm to the cockpit and take over controls, only to quickly fly to New York or Washington and crash into some buildings before the confused air traffic controllers notice that this is even a hijack (don't forget 99 out of a 100 cases where they can't reach a plane it's simply because someone fucks up the radio or transponder).
 
On the other hand, you find it completely plausible the American government at some level decided it was necessary to kill lots of civilians, somehow hire hijackers to take control over some planes, rig buildings in advance with explosives, make a plane disappear in Pennsylvania and blow up parts of the Pentagon, all the while feeding false information to the media, rigging investigations and getting away with it. And hooray Osama claims responsibility!
Seriously, even if the government wanted to carry out 9/11 themselves it would have made infinitely more sense to just ask some guys from Iraq (preferably some who can be linked to Saddam) to do it and surprise them, rather than going through all this bullshit of blowing up buildings themselves.
 
You have absolutely no idea how the real world works. This means you are (hopefully) still very young with a lot to learn, or much older but with some serious psychological disorders.

I'm from the Netherlands myself and pretty much all my friends know I own bitcoins because I can't stop talking about it.

Well if your computer is infected with a keylogger someone could have access to any private keys generated on this computer. This could be prevented by either using an offline computer to create private keys (make sure you look into [Armory]( if you really care about security, next version is going to be released quite soon), or easier still by simply creating a wallet at [Blockchain.info]( and using both two-factor authentication and double encryption. You'd be quite safe then.

You could install [Bitcoin Armory]( and create a wallet with either a regular or a fragmented paper backup. The information from these backups could easily be etched on a metal wallet.

The volatility is an extremely overrated problem. Merchants are able to convert their bitcoins to fiat for free or very low costs and people who own bitcoins are always able to buy new coins once they've spent some. Most volatility right now is because the total value of all bitcoins is still quite low, this will be corrected once they become more expensive.
 
I wouldn't recommend MtGox, try Bitstamp.

Nah it's not that, it's just that most have difficulty admitting they were wrong. They can't be wrong, there *must* be something wrong with this whole Bitcoin thing.
 
The fact of the matter is though that they either didn't take it seriously, or were too stupid to understand. Which hurts far more than just missing out on the money.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:45:43
I agree with you from a philosophical point of view and believe the rules of the market are best left to the market. However, given the current legal framework in the United States that isn't a realistic outcome, most markets, and certainly those involved with money, are extremely regulated there. 
 
Given this situation, accepting regulation is the lesser of two evils, the other being a situation were Bitcoin can only exist outside the American legal framework and therefore out of reach for most companies.
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:59:17

I've investigated this once and the conclusion was that this was quite hard to pull off. You need to have fiat at the various exchanges in order to profit from arbitrage and once in awhile you'll have to remove fiat from one exchange to add to another. The problem with this, as you've probably noticed, is that it's quite hard to move money around from and to the exchanges. Factor in the opportunity cost from having dollars or euros on exchanges you're not receiving interest on and the significant risk some exchange gets hacked thereby losing all your fiat + btc and the whole trade is hard to get a positive expected value on.
 
tl;dr: the infrastructure surrounding the markets hasn't matured enough yet.

No. If you want to make a profit, buy bitcoins instead of buying mining hardware, having to wait far too long for it to be delivered and then seeing your profits disappear when the electricity bill comes in. Mining in pools doesn't change this fact at all.
 
If you want to mine out of idealistic motives, then by all means, but don't expect to make more money compared to outright buying coins.

Basically not, although there are a few things that can be done without a connection, such as generating addresses to send coins to or creating transactions which are broadcast to the network at a later time. Or you could trade paper wallets or Casascius coins, although this isn't considered as safe as trading coins using Bitcoin directly, online.

This might be the best news of the day, exactly what I was waiting for. It seems these guys are professionals, using a trading system which has proven itself on Wall Street is a great leap forward compared to Mt.Gox' silly trading system.
 
It's too early to tell I guess, but if Atlas manages to comply with all the laws, work together with banks and the government to prevent fraud and laundering of stolen money, basically behaving like a proper financial institution, they have a good shot at becoming a market leading Bitcoin exchange within North America.

Well, we might be still in it. Only if you look back afterwards and zoom out on the graph, you'd be able to tell. But the singularity, event horizon, spike or whatever you might call it, doesn't necessarily have to go by the book. In fact, it's much more likely to be a messy and chaotic event, with the defining characteristic that the price will increase by massive proportions in a relatively short amount of time. Whether this is a month or a decade, I don't know, but it will change the world and it certainly isn't over yet.

I agree, the news from China never was good to begin with. However, it seems exchanges are still allowed to operate within China which is the important thing. Bitcoin will have a difficult time as a payment system in China, as an asset class it is still very attractive.

This is absolutely great and gives a glimpse of what the future of Bitcoin mining will look like. Eventually it will all come down to which miner can achieve the lowest operating costs, which are very much determined by energy consumption.
 
I can image that once the mining sector has stabilised (and margins are probably very low) they are able to play the energy market and only mine when they can get free electricity (which often happens in areas with lots of green energy, once the sun starts to shine or the wind picks up).

Well a good reason not to pay of debt is if the return on your assets is higher than what you might have to pay in interest. I have a student loan in the Netherlands for instance with an interest rate of 2.39% (which is high compared to the rate of 0.6% students after me have to pay) and extremely favourable conditions. Although I own much more in bitcoins than my debt, so far I am not paying it of.

Well I've thought about the possibility Bitcoin was created by a large hedge fund or bank, perhaps Goldman Sachs. It would make sense on some level, since those guys do anything to make money and creating your own one-world currency fits nicely in that goal.

Blockchain.info can be quite safe if done properly:
* Make sure you enable two-factor authentication.
* Be sure to use a strong password ([obligatory XKCD](
* Keep a backup in Dropbox, Gmail or Google Drive and protect it with 2FA as well.
* Use double encryption.
* Within the Blockchain security settings you can block access from TOR exit nodes. Please do so.

Yeah completely right, if you look at the difficulty most Americans have in buying bitcoins (especially now with the problems at Coinbase), the US is really missing out. 
 
Senator Schumer mentioned the enormous potential Bitcoin has, if it is holding up to it's promise and Bitcoin is going to dominate the future of global finance, it is essential that Americans can buy bitcoins right now. This window of opportunity is closing fast.

Although it has strong libertarian roots, Bitcoin is essentially a-political because it isn't tied to any political or economic power. And like the internet, there are still ways for the United States to exert its influence.
 
If you would design a single world currency from scratch with the purpose of getting both the powers that be and the public on board, you would inevitably end up with something remarkably similar to the Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:47:11
Imho the most important things you should consider are fraud, security and insurance. In money, trust is the key factor, so that's where your focus should be.
 
The thirst thing is fraud. Apart from people hacking the accounts at your bank or exchange, you should also consider the risk of thieves sending stolen money to your service, exchange it to BTC and get away with it. If this happens too often, regular banks will want to close your accounts because you've become a liability. Therefore, I'm glad you've stated KYC/AML verification is required, but you should go further and actively cooperate with banks in case there is a suspicion one of your customers used the account to hide stolen currency. I believe the failure to do so is what killed Bitcoin-24.
Then you should consider the security and insurance of your customer accounts. Your customers should be absolutely confident that even in the case they lost their password, had all their machines infected by keylogging malware or simply deleted their wallet by mistake, their bank is going to cover it. This level of confidence is expensive, but would allow many people currently afraid of the risks in Bitcoin to make the jump.
I wish you all the best of luck, this is exactly what Bitcoin needs right now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:17:15
Why did you go full fiat? I can imagine you cashed out, but I don't understand why you and so many other people who once had a large stash decided to sell all bitcoins. Surely you could have kept half of them?

The Winklevii disclosed that they owned around 1% of all bitcoins in April, so that's around 100k coins (probably more). They started buying in the summer of 2012 with a price of $5 per coin and they continued buying at least until April, at a price of around $100 per coin. So they invested somewhere between $1M and $10M in Bitcoin, I went for an average of $50 per coin (probably less though). With a price of $620 per BTC they own $62M worth.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:30:53
Bit-Coin, seriously?
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:44:06
Ah ok, thanks.
 
You could always consider with paying out in bitcoins though. This should only be done for small prices (like 0.01 BTC) and only a few per machine so it wouldn't give people the incentive to spend their whole day at such a machine, but it would greatly enhance the appeal for the machine for those who already know something about Bitcoin.

Just buy as much as you're comfortable with, never buying more that you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:24:22
In a way, yes. What you're doing is combining things like an insured bank account with a testament. It even goes beyond this level of protection because there is no maximum amount of money that can be insured, whereas if your bank goes bankrupt the government will only insure the first €100k (at least within the Eurozone). There is even extra protection because like Bitcoin your security transcends borders, in a case your country gets overrun by a war or revolution or if you become a fugitive from justice you have the ability to pack your stuff and move to the other side of the world with your assets still intact.
 
The most serious risks are the following however:
* Family or friends who are trying to steal your stash. These kind of things happen far more often than people realise.
* Hackers using keyloggers to steal your private keys.
* And by far the most common: people forgetting their password. Another reason why brainwallets are such a terrible concept.
What people often don't realise is that if you use Bitcoin the right way, it might very well be the safest asset class on earth, even safer than government bonds or gold.

However, while it's far from certain Bitcoin will dominate international finance, it does have advantages over the legacy banking system, something the author dismissed too easily. If these advantages are handled correctly and Bitcoin grows so the volatility goes down, I think it might just work and not become the next Segway or Second Life.

A large takeover in the Bitcoin space is certainly going to happen in the coming years, we just don't know which parties will be involved.

Nice to see Jon in his new role, he's doing quite well imho. I'm also pleased to see him focusing on the online gambling industry since that is were Bitcoin has the most value right now.

You started with a nice analysis of the possible economic implications of Bitcoin but when it got to "Bitcoin kidnaps children" and "due to Bitcoin, there will be a one-world government and we'll all be forced to wear implants", you completely lost it. I'm sorry, but that didn't make sense at all.
 
Bitcoin has tremendous positive effects, even on the short term. Think of the Chinese, who are currently unable to enjoy the fruits of their labor by importing products, due to currency restrictions. Think of South America, where many people don't know whether their government issued money will be worth anything by the time they are about to retire. Think of Africa, where many people are unable to open bank accounts and buy products online. These people will be liberated by Bitcoin.
 
Government currencies won't become unstable and hyperinflationary overnight. Bernanke is printing trillions of dollars yet you can still buy things with them! Sure, Bitcoin will attract a lot of wealth, but so do bonds, real estate and shares of Apple. The dollar will continue to exist for a long time, but monetary policy will have to be adjusted because central banks are facing competition from the free market.
 
The greatest change will be that governments can't keep spending and can't keep growing. They will have to be more prudent. The economy will be based on saving money rather than spending it, which will make it more robust. Instead of relying on the next generation to pay for your pension, you'll have to save for it yourself.
And although I'm a libertarian, my view of government is nowhere as bleak as yours. Most western governments are made up by people who basically want to do good. The problem is that politicians want to solve everything, instead of relying on individuals to come up with a solution once in a while. If Bitcoin can solve this, we've accomplished a lot.

You are completely taking this debate in the wrong direction suntoriTimes. You post an article which mainly consists of calling people names and if you get commented on that, you imply they are on the 'wrong side'. Please refrain from these childish tactics.

It's basically an attack where a mining pool which has at least 25% of total hashing power (quite feasible) creates a bunch of simulated nodes (the Sybil attack) to ~~make sure they receive more transaction fees than they are entitled to~~ create a situation where they selectively publish blocks, thereby sacrificing revenue for themselves but even more so for other miners. This in turn creates all the wrong incentives to keep a healthy network and can ultimately lead to a 51% attack where they are able to double spend. Because it's damaging to Bitcoin it won't happen in the short term, but if this scenario is still possible 20 years from now and everyone is dependant on Bitcoin, this creates a problem.
 
Tl;dr: while Bitcoin should solve the problem within the current financial system where a few TBTF banks are able to rob everyone else, the 25% attack could lead to a similar situation in the Bitcoin ecosystem if left unsolved. Don't worry however, it will be solved.

As there are only 12 million bitcoins in circulation and it would take around 1500 bitcoins to be considered a millionaire in USD, there can only be 8000 Bitcoin millionaires right now. Given that the distribution is far from equal, my guess would be no more than 1000 at this point.

I don't buy that either. The media, like any other commercial business, is simply motivated by profit. They make money by telling things their audience wants to hear, in order to sell advertising. When they leave out important things its mostly because they believe the subject matter to be too complicated or unpopular.

He's getting there, quite courageous to write an article like this. Although I believe his emphasis is still too much on the illegal aspects of the Bitcoin economy, he admits he was wrong earlier on. 
He is still a sceptic on things like the scalability of the network (which I can imagine) but at least he changed his stance from "no value at all" to "probably going to be valuable".

Well now the UK has it's own fully compliant exchange, the next logical step would be to team up with it's massive online gambling industry as this is a market which would immediately profit from using Bitcoin. We could use some real-world application of our beloved crypto-currency at this point.

Eventually Google and Bitcoin will team up, it's a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, this may take a long time since Google's primary concern is the legal status of Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin needs 10 years to achieve it's peak penetration and they would conquer 1% of the market (the three categories defined below), that would justify a value per coin of $1,014. If on the other hand you believe Bitcoin needs less time (5 years perhaps) to get to the top and would be able to conquer 10% of the market, it should be worth $20k.

This is incredibly unlikely. Bitcoin has been scrutinised by some of the smartest people on the planet and you happen to walk in and immediately make a discovery everyone else overlooked. If you really found out something, write a paper on it.

Scalability was my greatest worry about Bitcoin for a long time after I found out it's deflationary character isn't a bug, but a feature. Although I'm not entirely convinced there won't ever be problems with Bitcoins scalability at some point in the future, I'm quite confident now that all is going to be well, for the following reasons:
 
* Most Bitcoin users never need to worry about the size of the blockchain at all since they are using lightweight clients such as Blockchain.info.
* So far the blockchain isn't growing exponentially, but linearly.
* I'm downloading many gigabytes of movies and series each month and keep many of those stored on my computer. The blockchain has to expand by a factor of 100 before I'm even considering removing it from my pc.
* I don't believe Bitcoin has to be completely decentralized, it's ok if there are some server farms doing most of the mining and relaying of transactions. It's important though that it's still reasonably easy and affordable to establish such a server farm, i.e. within the reach of small to medium sized companies. This will ensure that Bitcoin remains resilient enough to withstand any threat posed by government or large corporations.

Very smart move. South Korea is one of those tech savvy nations were Bitcoin could really make a dent. And I like Coinplug's approach of being an exchange, wallet provider and merchant platform in one, effectively making it a complete Bitcoin bank.

Have you considered giving a small discount to those paying in Bitcoin?

There could very well be. I made the mistake of using my bitcointalk username as an alias only to notice in the logs that on two separate occasions someone with an IP from a Tor exit node tried to log in. Although I had 2FA and double encryption activated, I moved everything to a new wallet nonetheless.

I went into bitcoin a year ago and looking backs I could have made a lot more money if I bought litecoin instead. However, keep in mind litecoin was behind for most of the year until November, and I still think it's more of a speculators coin than a really valuable product. Sort of like Pets.com compared to Amazon.com. We'll see in ten years were litecoin stands.

Your welcome Kate. There is an option to encrypt your wallet twice. This could be useful if you use the Blockchain android app, which remembers the first password. I believe it is now protected by PIN as well however, so I don't know if it's still that relevant.
 
On the passwords: the most common way people lose access to their funds is not that they are stolen, but that they forget their password. This happens far more often, so it's often best to use a long sentence as a password because that can be remembered easier. And write the passwords down with pen and paper just in case.

They are still looking for a market maker. In absence of that they have to hope some people within the Bitcoin community could be inspired to trade some coins on their platform as a way to support them. It would be beneficial for Bitcoin as a whole to have a new, professional exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:35:03
As long as Bitcoin is still working, there will be mining (although for transaction fees rather than block rewards). For money there is a very strong network effect, so it's rather unlikely it can be supplanted with something better. If there really are features in other coins, Bitcoin will adapt rather than vanish.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:45:25
Well the big question is now, will the Chinese banks continue to provide the exchanges with banks accounts and money transfers? It seems they are certainly not legally required to do so and perhaps they see this notice as discouraging them to have *anything* to do with Bitcoin.
 
If so, will the exchanges be able to serve mainland China from Hong Kong or will there be some other solution?
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:25:42
Well I certainly wouldn't rule this out, although I'm not at all convinced what the added value of supporting an extra altcoin would be, other than making supporters of said altcoin rich. It's not as if they bring anything to the table which Bitcoin itself doesn't, so why bother?
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:42:40
Bitcoins should be treated like cash or gold, once they're stolen, they're gone. We know from using cash that there are basically two solutions to this problem: protection and insurance. There are good solutions to protect your coins, now we need insurance. It would be great if Coinbase or Circle may provide this in the future, so my grandma can use Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:45:16
I wouldn't say so, the term millionaire often refers to having a million dollars or perhaps euro's. An internet millionaire for example doesn't have a million internets (and not referring to the Bitcointip definition of an internet obviously).
 
I think we can still use the terms Bitcoin millionaire or Bitcoin billionaire this way.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:22:09
Can you describe how this would be implemented into Bitcoin? I guess it needs to be rigorously tested (on the testnet or perhaps an altcoin) before an update to the Bitcoin client is presented, which then needs to be accepted by a super majority of the miners, right?

Exactly. Those companies selling Bitcoin related stuff need to stop quoting prices in Bitcoin, as it is currently too volatile to be a good unit of account. It just makes Bitcoin look bad.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:13:26
Regulation isn't all negative, most of it concerns rules on how to handle disputes between private companies. If the Bitcoin market is more regulated, it opens the door for large companies (like Amazon for instance) to accept Bitcoin.
 
And in the end it doesn't matter, as Bitcoin isn't tied exclusively to the United States. If they overregulate, innovation will move elsewhere, if they underregulate, American companies will be too scared to adopt. There is a sweet spot and from what I've heard so far, the regulators seem to understand this.

Eventually, the fee will have to be decided by the market. It will have to be high enough for spam transactions to be uneconomical, for the miners to make a profit while still as low as the market will allow. There has been a lot of discussion on the best fee system and how to up scale Bitcoin in the future, I'm not exactly sure right now if there is a consensus.
