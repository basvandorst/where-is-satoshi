Dev's aren't bad neither dishonest, they just want to make bitcoin better and faster, but the way they are doing it is bad . its like a CEO wanting to make the supply chain faster by replacing people with machines . They want to get rid of miners, and Miners aren't happy getting fired they are the backbone to the code . 
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:56:50
You don't need to run any node anywhere, running a none mining node is only for merchants .

Switch to bch then .

What would happen if the miners choose to stay with bch? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:11:12
Do you really believe that miner's are going to invest on specific segwit mining hardware ? ¿What if they just decide to leave the segwit chain? That whats segwit its intended to do.

I got, a what i think is a great idea for the blockchain , but no idea on coding or anything relate to the code . Can anyone here help develop ?

It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he’s convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it’s timestamped in. He can’t check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it… …Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
The idea that a lot of non-mining full nodes will make the network more decentralized (because they can make sure the miners are behaving) is erroneous, because an SPV client can already query the network’s nodes. Generally, there would only be a problem if a majority mining of nodes were colluding dishonestly, in which case Bitcoin would be already broken.

Now you know why i wanted them .
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:56:35
Cause you want lower fees , they even got a tipping bot over there on BCH 
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:40:09
if the above dont fit,  you still can use LN in litecoin if you want . Bitcoin has to be de-centralized .

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

BCH is continuity , segwit do not need to relay 100% on miners or the blockchain . 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:25:05
I think What he is trying to say, is to stop using fiat to refer bitcoin or bitcoin fees . Anyone should be able to understand 1btc = $ (name it gbp , usd , jpy , eur ) or that a .0003 fee is good and a .015 is bad . 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:31:30
Or maybe they are just trying to survive by supporting the original code without segwit, who is trying to keep the fees for themselve .
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:44:11
Thats why i just switch to BCH

Too late for sing in another exchange who let you do funding &amp; trade without verifying tiers , That take some time , so , too late just for today. Check After the fork .
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:26:17
If i move the coins later than that, do i still get the BCC? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:19:12
Too late. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:15:57
Get the BCC coins 
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:20:49
I want the ready to trade option . I think BCC will
Fall rapidly .
