Now we're getting somewhere
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:39:14
Yeah, can't read. If I wasn't bankrupt I'd buy you a book you no good shill. Get educated or get left behind.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:41:18
Alright professor, I guess my whole in your story is wrong. Long live Fiat. You've convinced me.

Nothing my friend, Lord mcafee will simply turn the price back on. Don't worry.

Found the MAGA guy
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:37:29
You didn't sell your house like me when it hit $5k?
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:50:49
Do you have any experience dealing with bankruptcy settlements through bitcoin? Need advice for a friend.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:55:41
But if everyone does that, how will I plan my next exitscam?

Ehh...,this IS good for Bitcoin. Dirty NoCoiner. SMH.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:54:16
It's done on one of the safe exchanges like Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:25:16
Technically we haven't lost anything cause 1BTC still = 1BTC last time I checked. I don't see what's so funny about a valid theory being proposed. I guess it's like the old saying. "First they ignore you, then they mock you, then they laugh at you, then you win"
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:18:10
Lot of dirty nocoiners around here lately....looks at them 'not losing money' and 'being financially intelligent'.... just a PAC-O-SHILLS in my book...disgusting.

Well unless you want to miss the wave to da muan I suggest you hop on my creepto train. Boiyo

He did give them tariffs. Have you not been following the news for a few months. They arrived last month from Amazon Prime, swiftly killing my $MU $80 calls

Nah mate, don't remember the Chinese takeaway I had last night being any more expensive than it was a year ago. So clearly prices aren't passed on to consumers. Try take an Econ class some time and get educated. 
My granny lost money on APPL due to my recommendation of Apple $300 calls expiring end of the year, better than the GE stock she had.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:32:07
Stay away then nocoiner, gov shill. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:15:31
What do you mean? Me or Trump?
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:49:36
Nah mate, you all just missed the ship to da muan.

I wear crocs so that shoe thing doesn't make sense
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:27:24
Guessing you used Filthy Fiat ™ to purchase it right? Scum.

I'll have you know I'm a navy seal and a fully qualified engineer that's PROUD to be part of the economic revolution, if we need to build the odd Trojan horse to win the war then so be it.

What that BTC is only accepted in backwards, poor countries like Sri Lanka and Venezuela instead of civilized countries. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:22:25
I would but some things are too important not to be said, did Martin Luther King Jr. d the same when he faced criticism. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:48:38
That means it's about to become a lot cheaper to get bitcoins. Yay.

Unfortunately my family disowned me after I lost their investment, maybe the Lightning thing will get them to speak to me again. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:52:58
That doesn't look like my parents basement though?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:47:42
Ha, you think my family still talks to me after losing their money?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:58:43
Took you a while m9
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:00:53
You seem to be informed so can I ask you a question? I'm looking to write off my $2000 tax liability from my  job as a waiter so my question is When will it die? And can we speed up the process?
