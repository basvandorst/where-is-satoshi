Pulling back on the chart only matters if you are using bitcoin as a store of value. 
If your currency regularly drops/gains 20% (or more) of its value in only a day, it is a terrible currency. Your local shop owner won't be bothered to reprice all of his goods every 15 minutes along with the fluctuations of bitcoin. 
We simply will not get truly widespread adoption (as a currency) until we get stability.

Recognizing volatility is not short sighted. Bitcoin can not and will not be viable as a daily currency until it stabilizes.

Thanks for not refuting any of my points. Proceed with your fanboyism.

Sell? You should be buying!

I swear this sub has a higher percentage of worthless posts than any other.

Literal filth.

I know it. It's why I am hesitant to buy any more BTC, and considering the viability of an altcoin rebound without a btc rebound.

Open offer? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:51:50
ah, missed that. I haven't tried to trade since it rebounded.

fiy, this is not OP's OC. Check out Remy's other videos, most are great

I keep some BTC in my gdax account. The ratios for trading to LTC are really favorable right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:17:11
No, LTC. The conversion rates were VERY favorable during the dip to 10k
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:23
I see. I thought you meant "This of course prevents you from gaining if it goes up *after you bought back in*"
Your clarification makes sense.

What? That doesn't track

Dumb question: what do you use for a client to send coin with something like this? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:06:31
I mean factually, no.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:03:46
And pay those fees? No thanks. I'm more worried about coins sitting in unconfirmed limbo for weeks than I am about coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:37:37
You're not wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:07:57
Yeah, but normies drive the short term market. If it didn't take so long to get verified on an exchange we would see a jump in prices every time there was a news story talking up BTC. The surge is limiting more surge.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:28
Timing of it still screams drama, but whatevs
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:26
Nothing.

This way seems really easy to scam. People take about using Paypal to buy coins, but buyer protection does not apply to digital content.
