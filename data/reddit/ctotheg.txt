This is exactly what Abe's Japan government is trying to create from its Save-Mode population but simply cannot execute.

I thought Lightning Network was still in the testing phase.

What?  No.  
Have you even been to Japan?  Quality of life here in Tokyo is high and the rewards are far superior compared to the “costs.”
The reason Japanese work so hard isn’t because it’s expensive to raise a family.
OVERTIME IS UNPAID IN JAPAN
It’s not a financial reason to work more: it’s a cultural self-set obligation.   They don’t work more to get more money.  It’s certainly not more money because they are struggling to pay for their families.
I know people here in japan who have had 3 kids and another couple with 2 kids.  They paid ZERO for the hospitalized birth, and pay almost ZERO in taxes even now that the children are toddlers.  In fact, they get extra funding.  It might be difficult to get day care but it’s not expensive to raise a child here.
Perhaps you are attributing and projecting Causes of unhappiness in the USA onto japan.  They are not the same.
Japan doesn’t have the same “basic everyman can’t afford living space based on minimum wage” problem that the USA has.
Japanese aren’t killing themselves because of the economy or poor standard of life.  they are killing themselves because they are victims of bad work culture which doesn’t allow for psychological support for mentally unstable people who cannot say “no” when forced to overwork.  
They are not killing themselves by having 2 or 3 jobs and exhausting themselves in that way.  They have misled themselves into thinking they need to work for this one company and can’t say no to their boss - it’s a psychological issue.  Not an I need money to eat so I need yo work issue.
