This is the most sensible thing I’ve ever heard any politician say on the topic. Everyone else is in complete denial. Even if bitcoin never overtakes the dollar, it will continue to grow and it can’t be stopped with regulation.

The covfefe guy says it’s based on thin air. Damn, we were all wrong.

Listening to the press conference I don’t think he gets that you can make a transaction without a third party. He seems to think there will be Bitcoin “banks” that they can regulate.

I think this is probably next to impossible. Once you start dealing in fiat for an exchange, you’re subject to banking regs. If you try to ignore the regs, you go to jail. 
However, if the bitcoin ecosystem grew to where people were getting their paychecks in bitcoin, spending bitcoin, basically never touching US dollars, you would no longer need an exchange. I think that’s a long way off, but it’s possible.

Yeah but the guy I replied to was talking about a distributed exchange, which would be awesome but wouldn’t work anything like bitcoin because somewhere along the line fiat cash has to change hands.

Could be true but to imply that those groups make up a meaningful chunk of bitcoin users would be totally ridiculous.

I listened to about 15 min of the press conference. He states that they plan to regulate “all” entities handling cryptocurrency transactions using the same standards they use for banks today. I’m not sure if he understands what decentralized means.

Haha you can hear the clickbait forming in his question.

I watched 15 mins waiting for someone to bring it up. I figured if someone hadn’t pointed out that blatant oversight by then, no one was going to.

Well it’s just a total disconnect. An individual would never be able to comply with complex bank regs. You need a team of accountants and lawyers for that. Maybe he does get it and he’s just laying the groundwork for an impossible barrier to entry, but I seriously doubt it. 
They’re going to handle this the same way the music industry handled Napster. That is to say they’ll make all the wrong moves, fuck it up royally, then spend decades playing catch-up.

Might also be tax dodgers.

Awful, glad they caught them, but also pretty dumb. Literally all you ever had to do was google “is bitcoin traceable” and you would have known. But I guess their drive for sick shit is more powerful than their reasoning skills.

There was a huge bust of a child sexual abuse ring announced today. They were using bitcoin.

Finally, the Facebook phone won't be their biggest failure
