There are no governments, only banks posing as governments.

I am new to BTC. I found this site after doing business with igot.

I will give them this.... they are master exploiters.... exploiting is what they excel at... of course that is all they can do. They aren't any good at creating their own ideas...Deep Web Archons (I reserve my De jure power over the)

I am seeing one in Dubai but I do not know if it is open.
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:53:37
Thank you. 
I hope it isn't a loss yet. I am local to one of their offices. I can file a police report for the theft if it comes to that.
I see there are others who are in deeper than I.

Is IGOT Closing yet ?  : o
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:56:26
Unfortunately... I believe you... but I don't want to believe you... but I believe you.
Yes... going to call then go to local Dubai police and report a robbery.

I just keep getting the lip service from Dan and Rick.
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:24:02
The planet belongs to the people... not the de facto. So... there are no "Illegal aliens"... however.. there are fraudulent de facto governments being controlled by de facto Vatican slave runners. The de jure need no passport... the world is ours....
The one who wrote this on the wall in London probably works in the City of London...(Financial District of the World)
Bitcoin threatens them... so they attempt to marginalize by equating it with their own current fraudulent and corrupt monetary system.
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:55:15
Yet still... they are accepting money if you want to deposit.
At what point does it become FRAUD?
Accepting deposits but yet allowing customers to wait 30+ days demanding their withdrawals ?
I guess perhaps the local authorities in Dubai would help answer that...perhaps...
Fraud... is a crime.

Central Banking / Govco is going to do everything they possibly can to discredit BTC.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:19:01
Yes... my reason was because it was available in the UAE.
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:51:44
Max it's good to see you interacting AND solving issues with your customers... unlike IGOT.

Pursuant to Title 23, Chapter I, Part 200 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (the “Regulations”), persons may not engage in Virtual Currency Business Activities (as defined in subsection 200.2(q) of the Regulations) involving New York or New York Residents (as defined in subsection 200.2(h) of the Regulations) without a license issued by the New York Department of Financial Services: the so-called 'BitLicense.' The effective date of the Regulations is June 24th, 2015. Persons already engaging in activities that require a BitLicense must apply for a license by August 10th, 2015.
"persons may not engage in Virtual Currency Business Activities"
Are they..."persons" ?

Banking regulations attempting to destroy the BTC.
IGOT still has my 9+ BTC in lock down for 30 days now.
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:57:52
From the bitcointalk thread...
"If Igot is an honest business, you should stop accepting client money/BTCs until the operational issues are thoroughly sorted out."
^^^^ THIS^^^^^
Stop highjacking peoples money IGOT.... PO PO is coming !

Central Banking is doing their damnedest to de facto ize Bitcoin to do away with any hope of anonymity.
They can't have the slaves running a muck now can they ?
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:21:30
Good... keep them away from Igot.
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:05:37
I can't argue with that assessment...
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:46:51
It's just a theory yet to be worked out...
In other words... it hasn't been built yet but the theory is solid according to some.
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:40:07
IGot Got me too.
I am currently at a $2,500usd loss.
Rick has not paid me for my 2 attempts in withdrawing 9.64366652 in bitcoin.
It's been 20 days now.
I may have to report to Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN) as well if something doesn't happen soon.
...Very disappointed in this company.

I wrote to "Dan" dan
Response was quick and he said this in his reply...
"Hi Jeff
Sorry about the delay. We have had some technical issues over the last week. I will ask support to process it asap.
I wrote him back and supplied him with the two support ticket numbers I have and thanked him.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:52:17
Cool... thanks... I will check ! 
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:22:15
For a minute there I thought you worked for the Vatican... : )
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:49:49
Perhaps... I am careful at the power I give them... in other words, I am not convinced they are all powerful. I do think there are things that could escape them. If this analysis is correct, perhaps they will wait for the perfect time to use it to their advantage... isn't that what they usually do? "Never waist a good catastrophe..." I am weary of the block-chain and how it could make every financial transaction public... I  know I know.. there are ways but still it is quite a carrot for the tax thieves...
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:05:08
I'm still waiting.....
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:53:16
I am hoping that Dan and Rick read this and release my coins... otherwise I am getting prepared to do so.

Let's talk. I too am close to Dubia where Igot has an office(I think)... I may have to drive there and file a po po report too.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:43:09
Oh no ! Have the Mods been infiltrated ?  : 0
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:49:38
Final Update
Everything has been corrected. Dan was a big help.
Apparently I am doing something wrong on the bank wire/deposit side of things.. I have to figure that out. It's what was causing the longer than usual deposit times.
So... Dan and IGOT has done right by me.
I wish they would streamline and update their website a little bit more so morons like me can do things easier but other than that... I have no complaints.
Cheers to All....
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:57:13
No... I'm not that bitcoin savvy... I just entered the market so I am a noob. IGOT seems to be my only choice since I am in the UAE. Perhaps you know of a better place for me to buy?
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:03:54
Its just a standard cable... I have a hundred lying around. I got my Trezor yesterday. I went for the plastic version... no rust. So far, all is working great. I had a shipping problem but Trezor reshipped to me. Martin was patient with me, he did a good job. I am syncing to my Trezor phone app now. I like the security features thus far.

Just because it's bitcoin doesn't mean Rick Day cant do jail time... it's still fraud, theft, or breach of contract.
@_date: 2015-09-19 18:16:41
Rick Day.... You stole from me... that makes you a criminal.
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:08:27
You people are going to see how the BANKS are Gods. They have made and will continue to make Bitcoin illegal and treat it as if it where unlawful because it threatens their monopoly on money. What anti laundering money laws? Site the code. Code ? Are you subject to code ? Do an affidavit that the BIT CODE is not laundered. 
Next... the IRS has claimed that BITCOIN is a commodity...lol.. ok. How can the Bit Coin be laundered? it's not "money".
Evidence that the USD was laundered? Your affidavit is prima facia evidence. What is their evidence? Did they do an affidavit that the money IS laundered? Hummm No prima facia evidence it is laundered but prima facia evidence that it is not laundered... ok : )
This is an example of monetary slavery... they want you to absolutely prove where your $20 bucks came from... meanwhile... THEY do transactions in the trillions of dollars a day with out it for their...:Rich Customers" What a load of BS !
BANKING FRAUD ! FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD !
Getting a Loan for a house ?  Oh buddy... hide and wait... if you're watching... they're going to show you some REAL FRAUD NOW !!!
DEFAULT INSURANCE.. yeah .. check that one out...
LOAN ? LOL.. What Loan ? They wont be able to show where money changes hands. It all done fraudulently with "Book Keeping Entries" which means.."Money for Nothing"  
THERE ARE NO GOVERNMENTS.... ONLY BANKS POSING AS GOVERNMENTS...
FRAUUUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDD !
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:28:17
Yes there is such a thing... a defacto criminal case and then a de jure civil case...
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:26:49
Rick Day needs to be arrested. He is a criminal and IGOT should be raided by an International Swat Team and all assets frozen.
I hope to be an key part of a class action on that thieving a$$ of his.
@_date: 2015-10-20 18:20:03
It was so fast... we missed it ?
@_date: 2015-10-04 12:41:12
Yes... that's because IGOT finally paid you what they own you....
