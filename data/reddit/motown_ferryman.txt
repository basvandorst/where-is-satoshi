I just refreshed my page. 11k

They whales buy big. Price goes up. They sell big and fast (with profit). Price goes lower and lower. They buy big again ... slowly (at a lower level). Price goes up. And they sell again. And so it goes on. In the meantime, a group of small fish also follows the whales. This strengthens the effect.

Lets go to a new all time high! + 20k

A portfolio with no bitcoin is like a body with no soul.

Only a matter of time. Eventually it will break through.

Bitcoin has a good character. Some people had forgotten to step in. So he picked them up. Now lets move back to 10K Let's go!
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:59:41
He was way ahead of his time!

I have some fiat ready. But I have the idea that these downward cycles will continue for a while. I'll wait a bit longer. Maybe a month ... or two ... or three.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:32:02
It’s only matter of time. Bitcoin is on the rise again.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:02:23
If we get through this sunday and stay above 8k, it's bull time!

upward tendency
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:22:21
I expect fewer people will dare to go short after this. and people on the sidelines will board again. I expect that the trend will be further upward
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:41:40
it is really starting to look like we have reached a turning point
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:59:19
it seems as if the strength of the sellers is beginning to decline in this region

The more widely-held a belief that the existing trend will continue, the less likely that it will. Markets hit the bottom not because of the appearance of buyers but when the sellers stop selling.

In a bear market, every time the price falls, it becomes harder for the bears to push the price even further down. Markets hit the bottom not because of the appearance of buyers but when sellers stop selling. They peak when buyers stop buying.
We have been at this level for a week now. Maybe we will see one last convulsion of the bears. But again there is a certain point that there are too few sellers. It's starting to look like we have reached this point. The general environment at lows can be uncertain and worrying. The sentiment of many people is that everyone will sell or that the whole system will collapse. It is normally darkest just before dawn.
