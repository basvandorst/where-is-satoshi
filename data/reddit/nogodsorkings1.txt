It's not just "personal information", it's *payment authorization credentials* that can initiate a 'pull' transaction to take money from your account. For example, I gave such information to my utility provider for automatic bill pay. Last year, a computer error resulted in the city taking $1600 from my checking account that I didn't owe them. At that point, I had to kindly ask for my money back, which took them three months. 
Now I use auto pay less and less, and prefer wiring money when possible.  Bitcoin is like a system where all transactions are 'push', rather than 'pull'.

No. A gives 10 mB to B, B tells A she has 10 mB in her account. B then loans 8 mB of this to C. C potentially deposits his coin in another institution, and the cycle repeats. The total 'perceived' holdings by both A and C are 18 mB, and they may act accordingly. The party stops if for some A needs more than 2 mB of her funds at once, or C doesn't pay up.
Bitcoin doesn't make any of this impossible;  however, by enabling a public record of all transactions, it make it impossible to do it in secret. Additionally, Bitcoin makes it possible to securely hold one's own currency, making the need for point-of-failure B less to begin with.

You can, but as the proportion of economic activity conducted in cryptocurrency becomes non-trivial, the difficulty of tracking taxable funds becomes impractical.
The direct way states collect taxes is through income reporting to the relevant authorities, backed by the implicit threat of a potential audit for non-compliance. Most income taxes are withheld, some are paid by the recipient, but either way, they know how much you should owe, and if you don't pay it they start sending letters/cops/bullets in your general direction.
Bitcoin undermines this by making it possible to easily operate a second set of books that don't get reported to tax authorities. To maintain a facade of compliance, some transactions would have a nominal amount of USD associated with them that gets reported, and a parallel BTC transaction that goes unreported. One might pay a consultant a total compensation of 100$/hr, split evenly between BTC/USD. The reported salary still looks plausible enough to appear legit if anyone asks questions. If you don't think anyone will do this, remember that the untaxed status of healthcare benefits during the 1930s price controls is the reason why a trillion dollars of our economy gets routed through employers for this purpose today. Bitcoin would offer a similar means to give employees an effective 'raise' at zero cost to the employer.
An indirect way authorities collect taxes is looking at suspicious activity for individuals. A key means here is control of consumer banking institutions. Storing cash is difficult, and investing is effectively impossible on a cash-only basis. Banks, required to collect their customer's identifying information, provide a centralized point of control to see when people make suspicious deposits.
Bitcoin subverts this by making it possible for the layperson to maintain their own store of unreported currency in a way that can't be stolen as easily as paper bank notes. If he does not store it himself, he can control hundreds of accounts under any name, or no name, with an online Bitcoin wallet service. More important, Bitcoin can be transferred and invested easily on any scale, and the potential of using the network to store digital securities and other ownership information provides the possibility for investing your untaxed BTC income into untaxed BTC stocks.
A third method by which Bitcoin undermines taxation is another by-product of a less bank-oriented economy. At present, tax authorities can easily compel banks to give them money from your account if you don't pay. This would be impossible with Bitcoin, where no Bank Of America-type institution exists as a central point of failure. The only means of enforcement would be the state's fallback - physical confiscation of property, or arrest. However, the only way that the current system sustains itself is by making this a last resort that only needs to be used for a small minority of subjects. If physical enforcement is used for each and every person to be taxed, manpower costs become impractically large, and public relations problems from the visible application of force undermine the implicit authority of the state.
It should be noted that, at present, it is possible to use network analysis methods to track blockchain transactions and infer ownership of public keys for the purpose of finding someone's money. Devoting manpower and computing power to this task would get impractical when trying to track down whether millions of daily Starbucks coffees were paid for with after-tax Bitcoin, especially since a false positive hit could ensnare the IRS in litigation. The continued improvement of laundering services could make this effectively impossible.

True, but that's a stopgap measure taken as a show of good faith. If the card issuer and merchants eat the losses, it is effectively the same as the user purchasing a compulsory insurance policy against fraud. The cost gets factored into every credit card purchase, everywhere. There's nothing to stop Bitcoin payment processors from issuing similar insurance, but the choice would be left to the user.

It's true that Bitcoin users face a higher risk of scams and fraud at the moment. However, this is due to the technology's infancy and grey market status; it is not a systematic failure of the protocol. As networks of trust and social capital expand, the community will be safer, but the core technology is the strongest point in the chain.
By contrast, credit card transactions were created in a largely offline world, and by design requires that the payee handle cardholder credentials to initiate the transaction. This introduces counterparty risk that grows as the user interacts with more nodes, each of which is another point of failure. It's the reverse of Bitcoin situation - the system works because of high trust and social capital, and almost everyone acts in good faith, even through the protocol is less secure.

In the Bitcoin network, transaction fees are 'from each according to their willingness to pay' and mining rewards go 'to each according to their ability'. It's the opposite of how collectivized production traditionally works.
The fact that the resulting economy is more widely distributed than the traditional system might be desirable to some, but libertarianism has nothing to say about this.
The only part that requires real resources be committed without direct payment is relaying network data in the peer-to-peer network, but this is a trivial cost for most loads.

For standard UberX service, this has always been a lie. There is only the fare schedule and nothing extra is calculated. There is no app function to add a tip for your UberX driver. Uber said the tip was included to get customers out of the tipping mindset, so that the service is as hassle free as possible.
The company seems to have stopped saying that line after drivers pointed out that collecting a commission on what the customer thinks is a tip is blatantly illegal. (Uber just takes a cut of the entire transaction.) If a business touches a tip at all, the Department of Labor will bring down hellfire on them.
Also, while tipping is never expected, just know that it absolutely makes our day. A $5 tip basically doubles my effective compensation for that hour, since drivers make so little.

That's the sick beauty of it from Apple's perspective. They need to have the clause in the contract for deniability purposes, to be sure. But in the case of these apps, the process has been:
- "Your app has been removed because it violates Clause X."
- "Okay, in what countries does it violate Clause X?"
- "It is the developer's responsibility to know all relevant laws."
The conversation can go absolutely nowhere, so Apple can kill a competing product with no recourse for the developer. In addition to the obvious antitrust implications, I personally believe such a contract is unenforcable and should be viewed as null and void in court until such time as Apple can provide, if only in vague terms, what laws it thinks the developer has run afoul of.

Whether he sent bitcoins, dollars, or pet rocks as his money of choice doesn't have much impact on the outcome. Two possible differences may be:
1. Existing law enforcement doesn't understand Bitcoin, so even if you had a decent case it would be difficult to act on it.

Excited about this product, so I started to buy with Coinbase checkout. You can see my transaction from Mycelium here:
But 15 minutes later, the checkout page still says 'the balance at that address is 0.00 BTC'. Uh, no, it isn't, I can see it on Blockchain.info. Reload the page, and my session has expired and I'm not willing to try again knowing I might lose my money. I received an email notifying me of my order but no payment confirmation.
F*** you, Coinbase servers. Either their node is down, or their internal system for updating the transaction as 'paid' for the webpage to verify is down.
I'm really disappointed, because I've spent well over 1000 USD on many dozens of BTC purchases over the past few weeks, and this is the first time it's ever taken longer than five seconds for a Bitcoin invoice to verify payment.

I don't think this is a problem. "Intrinsic value" is a useful way to explain the origins of existing money, which emerged organically through trade, only to be explained centuries later in economics treatises. Gold is used as a luxury item, and later acquired some industrial applications to add to it's 'intrinsic value', but it would be absurd to justify the current supply or price of gold-as-money by reference to this 'intrinsic' usefulness. Money is a shared suspension of our disbelief, to some extent - if faith in the money use of gold collapsed, it's alternative uses could only sustain a price of less than $100/oz in current market conditions (Or so I'm told, the point is that it's next to nothing.)
Gold today doesn't draw value from its status as a desired commodity, that status only explains its origins as money long ago. Bitcoin was created in a world in which the economic and philosophical conversations about what money is and how it is useful have already taken place. It is thus possible for us to design 'the perfect currency' that has no alternative uses* and not really care about that fact, because we're not building from the ground up through barter. We're manufacturing the collective fiction of 'money' right before our eyes, knowing exactly what we are doing, and allowing the market to discover a price that reflects nothing other than the usefulness of Bitcoin in trade.
*(Though the Bitcoin protocol has developed some interesting alternative applications, such as notarization and stock trading, these are mostly hypothetical future applications of the blockchain concept and not worth mentioning so far as 'intrinsic value'.)

This is probably not possible, unfortunately. Here's how I suspect the process works:
Merchants sell Gyft virtual 'cards' in bulk at less than face value. They get the money up-front. Gyft then resells the preset denomination cards to you at face value or slightly above it, making a profit. The customer benefits from the ease of use of the Gyft service and phone app.
This all requires that a separate, parallel infrastructure be maintained by the merchant (or contracted payment processor) to keep track of the gift card system. It also requires employees be trained in using the cards. For example, when paying for a burger with Gyft last week, a manager needed to come out to enter the information, and even she had never actually seen a gift card used before. This is all an enormous hassle for a streamlined retail corporation. Every penny matters when retail only returns a few percent to owners every year.
Merchants put up with this for a few reasons, some of which are obvious - people like giving 'personalized' money as a statement to others, so gift cards represent a way to get new customers into the door. They also act as a constant advertizement sitting in people's wallets.
But most important to the business, gift cards are effectively an interest-free loan from customers to corporations. Buying a gift card is buying a claim to a dollar value of product from the store at some point in the future. In the bond market, such claims trade at a discount, due to the time value of money and the alternative uses of said money.
However, gift cards usually sell at face value, or very close to it. If you give them $100 for a card, they happily take your money today and record this in their books. Along with this, they enter a $100 liability in the ledger. Nominally, this is a wash, but from an economic perspective, the net present value of dollars owed in the future is some number less than 100%. As far as their accountant is concerned, they made a profit the moment they sold the card. Even if the customer redeems the full value of the card a couple months later, that's two months they had that $100 working for them for free. Not only that, but the card is only good for services in-kind, which they are happier to part with relative to their precious cash reserves.
Even better than that, the cards' values aren't indexed to inflation, so the merchant gets to 'pay you back' in product equal to the value of dollars inferior to the ones they received for the card, which is more free money for them. On top of all of this, any time a card is lost, forgotten, or not redeemed before a preset expiration date, the merchant owes nothing further to that account. If I recall correctly, only about half of the potential value of cards actually gets redeemed on average. So our hypothetical transaction would result in the merchant receiving $100 immediately, while potentially only adding $45 to the liabilities column. It's free money to them, even if they are selling it to Gyft for only $90 wholesale.
Your proposal effectively negates all of the benefits of the gift card program to the merchant, and to Gyft for that matter. Think of the cards as bonds, not as bank accounts with a balance. The merchants want to get paid right away, then give you as little as possible later on. Gyft wants to sell the cards quickly, minimize the number of transactions between currencies, keep as little card inventory possible, and avoid exposure to exchange rates. They also want to wash their hands of the chore of maintaining card balances or otherwise assuming responsibility for an ambiguous and difficult to price set of liabilities, which they might then need to insure.

First, objections to altcoins are hugely different from objections to Bitcoin itself. Nobody who believes in Bitcoin is criticizing altcoins because 'they're unregulated' or 'inflation is necessary' or 'someone might hack all the coins'. So just cut it out with that comparison.
The move from dollars and Euros to cryptocurrencies is a categorical change that offers significant advantages to almost everyone. The move from one cryptocurrency to another offers minor benefits that most users will never notice. Barring some major, as-yet-undiscovered weakness of the Bitcoin protocol, no altcoin will serve any useful purpose that can justify the switchover costs. Right now, they are all just me-too currencies used by people who missed the Bitcoin boat and want to increase the market cap of their presently cheap coins. Unless your alt-chain protocol is designed for something categorically different, such as identity verification or notarization, anyone talking about them is doing us a disservice.
Currencies have no use without network effects and shared confidence, a willing suspension of disbelief. It was inevitable that one cryptocurrency, probably the first, would take over and become perceived as useful. At present, the mixed messages and duplicate infrastructure of altcoins has the potential to seriously undermine consumer confidence and hinder adoption of crytocurrency.
We need to maintain a party line. Bitcoin has established an effective ideological infrastructure that introduces newcomers to the digital currency concept and answers reams of common objections. The fact that we were able to impress the writer from Seeking Alpha with clear answers, overcoming his preconceived notions of us and our project, was nothing short of a miracle.
Bitcoin needs to continue this successful public outreach. Imagine how much less confidence reporters and newcomers would have if, when they asked someone what this Bitcoin thing is about, they got conflicting votes of confidence and people telling them how altcoin X is even better than Bitcoin, because the proof-of-work is RAM-limited, or network propagation speed is 10% faster, or whatever the fuck tiny improvement was used to justify its existence. These are concepts nobody who uses digital currency should need to think about.
As a comparison:
In a world dominated by Obamas and Romneys, Ron Paul offered something categorically different from the status quo. Even though he didn't get elected, the cohesive Ron Paul narrative effectively won over hearts and minds and has permanently altered the Republican political landscape. This would have not been possible if libertarians had contaminated the message pushing a baker's dozen of AltPaul candidates.
Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. Bitcoin represents a combined political movement and product launch. The product we have is great. Achieving legitimacy and merchant adoption requires coalition-building and holding the party line. Don't complicate the narrative. "Bitcoin - It's the *currency of the internet*".
Now go spend some Bitcoins.

First, your user name is pretty cool.
Such an exploit is not prevented but remains impractical. Both transactions would have to be initiated within roughly 10 minutes. As soon as the second transaction is broadcast, the conflict would be noticeable by the first party. The attacker would need to disappear before either of these windows closed. This is a tremendous improvement in detection time relative to a bad check or counterfeit note. 
Since nobody's online purchase will have shipped within 10 minutes or otherwise be irreversible, and it's not worth risk in person for small theft, the application of such an exploit of 0 confirmation trust is minimal.

These policies are harsh, but the target audience probably shouldn't have too much trouble complying. Hopefully this will keep inexperienced users off the site and allow for more support focus on the service itself for those who know what they are doing. As he says, if you don't like those terms, don't use his service.

Their bitcoins only exist as an accounting abstraction on a shared ledger. In what way does it benefit the average user to have a copy of said ledger? They aren't 'keeping their bitcoins local' in any meaningful sense.


One solution for compacting the blockchain is to keep only the unspent outputs necessary for new transactions. Other than that, there is no hope. Every transaction must be recorded somewhere. The growth will only accelerate as applications begin to take advantage of Bitcoin's internal scripting.

That's true, which is why I spent the past two days trying to help a new Bitcoin user after Blockchain.info's iOS app didn't attach a fee, leaving a substantial amount of money 'stuck' in the network. I felt like I was apologizing to him on behalf of all Bitcoin users everywhere because of this company's oversight.

There are many well thought-out talks on the internet you should Google around for. My quick thoughts are as follows. It's not going to change the world hugely in at least a couple decades, if at all, but there will be small improvements every step of the way.
Good scenario:
BTC becomes popular for web commerce, some brick-and-mortar business, and replaces some wire transfer type services. Small businesses benefit moderately from lower transaction fees and reduced liability for chargebacks. Poor families sending money between countries still use middle-men, but the barriers to entry are dramatically reduced and these services become cheaper. Some MMO type games use it for in-world currency. BTC/fiat remains volatile, but few notice because they are using third-party services like BitPay that shield them from exchange rates for a small fee. PayPal loses market share, and probably starts to use BTC as the backend infrastructure because of competing services that do the same thing they do now for &lt;1% fee. A microtransaction economy emerges for musicians, YouTubers, and bloggers, and many platforms previously taking a cut of their revenue for ad services go under as it becomes possible to easily sell directly to the customer.
Outside of the developed world, BTC gains modest acceptance as a day-to-day currency in poor nations who have poor banking infrastructure. They hate the volatility, but their own government's currency is worse. Their standard of living improves measurably as it becomes possible to save money over a period of years, not just weeks.
Great scenario:
BTC/fiat rates stabilize and BTC becomes a useful store of value. Bank Of America offers accounts and debit cards denominated in BTC. People get comfortable thinking in terms of BTC prices, rather than seeing BTC as a vehicle for moving fiat. Some people get paid BTC salary and have BTC apartment leases, which are adjusted based on a BTC price index rather than the fiat exchange rate. The ability of governments to inflate is reduced, making the average person somewhat better off. 
Full network nodes no longer run on a home computer, but most universities and mid-to-large businesses have a server rack running one with a dedicated fiber connection. Cryptocurrency corporations become respectable, with shares traded solely on the blockchain, and legacy stocks are increasingly traded through single-Satoshi proxies rather than as stocks themselves. Entrepreneurship is easier now that there is no paperwork involved in fundraising and creating a corporation or cooperative. Realtors and title insurance companies are increasingly being cut out as the blockchain is used to register and trade property titles.
At this point, the establishment investment banks are seriously sweating and need to find real jobs. Rather than paying $40/trade and 1/3 of your gains for a mutual fund, anyone can buy any public stock on their smartphone instantly and for a negligible fee. Your index fund is no longer managed by Vanguard, instead, a single server now tracks the market and executes trades autonomously for your 401k.
Many small nations adopt BTC as legal tender and abandon their own individual currencies. Other nations with poor currencies may not, but they find their banks devoid of customers as citizens adopt superior cryptocurrency alternatives.
Best scenario:
BTC or its successor is the world reserve currency. The power of fiat currencies to inflate is destroyed. At most, citizens only convert to fiat for the purpose of paying taxes, or use it in the extremely rare event they do not have internet access. Governments must raise all revenue through direct taxation. With the price of government services now clearly indicated on tax bills, rather than hidden through inflation of the money supply, the state begins to shrink. Evading taxation on the network is easy, and governments begin to provide only those services they can sell to willing customers. Many public goods problems are solved through programmed transactions that trigger automatically when a critical mass is assured.
The world is now a generally better place, though it might not be noticeable every day. Saving money is easier, and the slow wealth-transfer of inflation is gone. Your money goes farther. The general angst of the population is lessened, but they might not be able to place why. Banking is a more customer-facing business, evaluating loans, providing deposit insurance against hacking, and so forth. The investment banking sector still exists for those with money to risk on new ventures and investment strategies, but the average person doesn't worry about them - their retirement portfolio is a share of ownership in a digital corporation run by an AI.
The core nodes servicing the BTC network are several hundred datacenters, owned by a few dozen corporations and governments existing in perfect competition and making a thin but steady profit securing the network for transaction fees.

This is not the part of the terms of service Apple has referenced so far, which makes sense since Apple mainly wants a cut of 'in-app' purchases. They have only said it violates their boilerplate "apps must be legal everywhere they are sold" clause. However, they also refuse to provide any guidance as to what laws were actually violated, which in my opinion makes their terms of service an unenforcable contract.
It seem a lot like 1) a cover-your-ass move against any ill associations with Bitcoin, and 2) a convenient way to kill of potential competing products that don't technically violate terms of service, where adding further restrictions to the TOS would have antitrust implications.

We need better web services. For the average person, Coinbase == Bitcoin, just as Visa == Dollars, or Facebook == Internet. Remember, average people have been shielded from you all your life. They don't understand how YouTube runs atop the TCP/IP protocol, and they won't understand how Bitpay runs atop the Bitcoin protocol.
Countless thousands will continue to lose millions of dollars after storing/buying coin through a website run by a startup with a slick UI that promised to be 'secure', and put that damn padlock icon on the login page. These users will not have their faith in the currency restored by the incomprehensible nonsense they hear about wallets and addresses and keys they were supposed to be backing up.
The future of Bitcoin rests in winning over the mind of a 25 year old girl we will call Sarah. Sarah has not exerted any willpower in her life to understand how the world around her came to be or operates, and she wouldn't make much sense of it if she tried. She will not spread her money across multiple providers. She will deposit all of her Bitcoin into one provider, and leave the app signed in on her unsecured iPhone, which she has never backed up to iTunes even after that one time she came really close to dropping it in the sink. Her wallet pin will be the year of her birth, and her password will be the name of her dog, and both of these passwords will be reused for every site she has ever touched.
Sarah votes. Sarah talks to her friends, especially when she feels screwed over by the system. And she exercises as much influence as any one of us in any discussion about government regulation of Bitcoin security standards.

There are proposals to truncate the blockchain by only retaining unspent outputs, but that seems a long way off.
Using a distributed file system could take away some of the robustness of Bitcoin, which comes from each node having an independent copy.
The projected data growth is really quite manageable. 1TB of storage was standard for a notebook I purchased this year, and I'm building a 20TB server for my movies for cheap. Businesses that are going to be mining will have many times this, and storage costs are decreasing at a rate that more than offsets the rate of growth of the data.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:40:59
The protocol wasn't designed for the average user to download the full blockchain. This is why new users need to be discouraged from using the official client and directed to use simple payment verification (SPV) nodes instead.
12 GB is *nothing*. It may well be 100GB a year from now, and that's still nothing. The cost of running a full node will almost never become a problem given present growth rates in storage capacity and bandwidth.

Just ordered one. Some constructive criticism, since you seem to be relatively new to this.
- Your 'comments' field at checkout is currently set to be mandatory. Make this optional.
- Color and other options should be drop-down menus, not open fields that require the customer to tab back and forth from the product page to make sure they used the correct word for the shade of brown they wanted.
- I like high res pictures, but scale that down somewhat.
- Take better pictures, not only to make the product look better, but so the customer has an accurate representation of color options.
- Include labeled images showing each color leather and thread. I just gave you 33 mBTC and I'm still not sure exactly what I ordered.
Most curious of all, your BitPay invoice refers to an entirely different URL,  upon completion. This site appears to be template site currently under construction, where I can see a picture of a leather bag sitting in what I presume is your house.

The iOS Blockchain app hasn't been updated and doesn't attach a transaction fee by default, and I don't think there is any way for the user to specify one. This can result in transactions being stuck on the network for hours or days.
Words cannot express how much I hate this app. I saw how much damage it was doing after I helped new users to Bitcoin who had large amounts of money 'disappear' while using it. The users then blame Bitcoin instead of the noncompliant software they were using. If you were a new user to VISA and, on your first swipe, your money left your account but went nowhere, you'd be pretty pissed too, and probably wouldn't trust debit cards for a while. This is what Blockchain and other poor/old wallets are doing to Bitcion's public image.

If you have a phone or tablet, setting up a BitPay merchant account costs next to nothing and gives you a way to reach a new set of customers who might not otherwise visit you. Existing sales data suggest Bitcoin users are willing to pay more than other customers and have a high attach rate to merchants that accept the service. I met with one small business owner who set it up and is happy so far; It didn't take too much effort to train employees to punch in a total on an iPad and let the customer scan a QR code. Payment confirms in seconds.
There's plenty of reasons to use Bitcoin. The limitations right now:
- If your area isn't tech-savvy, you'll probably not get a lot of users. NYC and SF are huge for Bitcoin, here in Austin there's a little traction, but I don't have to drive too far to run into businesses that still don't even take credit cards.
- It only takes a few minutes to show an employee how to use it (they just punch in a total), but employees should be assumed to be idiots. An employee who hastily types the wrong total could create a bad customer experience.
- Since the best experience is with a smartphone/tablet, you might need to buy one for your point-of-sale.
- Depending on how you do your accounting, adding an extra payment method to track could create extra work for you. I think this is less of a problem for small businesses who probably don't have anything more complicated than QuickBooks.

Congrats! I ordered one myself and I can't wait.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:11:23
I agree that the uncertainty over transaction fees is a large problem at the moment. This is mainly due to software developers who failed to anticipate the sudden increase in the exchange rates, and who are unreliable in pushing timely fixes. In the short term, an automatic exchange rate conversion to keep the fee at around one cent would go a long way in this area. In the long term, a software change that allows clients to estimate the market-clearing price for transaction fees should be all that is needed.
The 'stuck transaction' problem is also a large one, especially for new users, as you point out. I recently had to help a user of the outdated Blockchain.info client for iOS, which had no means of attaching a fee, after he had about $150 stuck for a couple days. Although this can be fixed by re-sending the transaction with a fee, forcing a double-spend that displaces the previous transaction, their software certainly had no way to do this, and he wouldn't have ever known to try. In the end we were saved because Bitpay kindly sent him back the money when they got it two days later.
Personally, I don't see much issue with having to wait ~30 mins before re-sending coins. This serves a useful anti-spam purpose and most of our economic life doesn't require moving money in and out of an account that fast.
For perspective, as a Bank Of America customer, most paychecks I have deposited over the past three years have taken *days* to clear, and sometimes as long as a week. Even worse, I have no advance indication of when a deposit will or will not have delayed confirmation. I'm at the mercy of the institution, so I've had to plan my life with a large buffer around bill and rent payments because I never know if my first-of-the-month paycheck will clear on the first or the fifth.
You know what really makes me love Bitcoin? Having my last paycheck retroactively taken out of my account a full week after it 'cleared' because of a problem with my boss's handwriting. On top of that, I didn't find out what had happened until a couple more days later, because they only thought to inform me by means of a physical letter. Sure would be nice if they'd thought to include that information in an email, or one of their many apps, or the website.
Maybe we could use direct deposit or wire transfer, but unless both customers are at the same bank the fees add up fast. And it still takes at least a day. Certainly for a small business customer we can't manage the overhead. With Bitcoin, having to wait for three-block confirmation on a large deposit is a huge step forward for me.
