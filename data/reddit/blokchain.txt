@_date: 2018-02-07 19:47:47

@_date: 2018-02-07 16:32:02
you will be in heaven forever when your time on earth is finished
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:04:59
a sinful name, Jesus has no love for sinful names
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:48:29
Glad to hear!

Bless you
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:42:25

@_date: 2018-02-07 20:51:12

@_date: 2018-02-07 16:48:12
please do not use the good Lords name in such tones
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:48:07
Roger Federer for one
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:12:07
I like that phrase. I like you. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:42:45
obviously its Jesus
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:17:03
Jesus feels your pain
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:05:11
God bless you
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:58:23
but its focused on value exchange. Byteball is also a platform. Have you tried the wallet? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:12:36
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:46:40
argue that in the court of hell please
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:41:34
:) its too easy to start arguments online, I'm as guilty as many people. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:54:54
I made the OP. I have nothing against Bitcoin Cash or Roger Ver. I was sent to earth to spread the word of Byteball, and I simply leveraged Bitcoin Cash and Roger Ver to help the cause. I have not sinned. Your time is better spent reading the Byteball whitepaper   than sending me angry messages on Twitter.

stealing is not funny :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:32:23
bless you Seb. Jesus loves you too
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:40:16
bless you
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:36:31
hahah! an eternal spicy burrito nightly Dutch oven for Roger Ver. Jesus will happily provide this
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:41:41
parastic? jealous of no blocks and miners DAG tech?
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:43:06
poor Roger :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:33:55
blatant theft. Thieves will go to hell and bun forever
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:50:17
I prefer "salud"
