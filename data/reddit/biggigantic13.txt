I read about this false-positive fraud prevention happening with them while sitting here reading more about it.  Is there any way I can avoid this?  I'm really trying to get my coins ASAP.  If I do a smaller amount, say their minimum for the first time, instead of the amount I really need, do you know if this will have a higher chance of getting approved so that I can come back and get the rest?

Looking into this right now.  Thanks for the heads up.

Haha yup, didn't even think to check my email.  They did cancel it.  I had heard about their cancelling orders because they are "too high risk" but I didn't realize they did it at the very last minute.  That is some serious bullshit.  It takes until the very last hour to deem my purchase as high risk?  That is seriously fucked up and I'm debating on whether I even want to give them a second chance at my business at this point.
What is the procedure to get them to approve the order?  Just place the order again and hope this time they don't fuck me over?  Wait 3-5 days to get my money back, and the waste another week sitting around and assume it will be different this time?

Yeah I did research on them and I'd heard about them cancelling orders but nowhere had I read that it would be done within the last HOUR of waiting, after a week.  In no way did I imagine that it would take that long to decide not to send me what I ordered.

Sounds like a way to get robbed to me.  I'd definitely like something trustworthy AND with escrow for the amount I'm buying.  Simply depositing xxxx.xx amount of dollars into someone's bank account and then trusting they will send me what I ordered is, I hope, not my best option!

My thoughts EXACTLY!  And this is why I'm not doing business with them.  If you get enough money from unsuspecting people to continuously have a nice chunk of change to invest or collect interest on, you're making out without ever offering any service.  Fuck coinbase.  Truthfully, the fact that they made me wait an entire week before deeming me some ridiculous "threat" (which is total bullshit, they already had my money.  What were they going to lose.), I'm going to go out of my way to divert any and all business from them that I possibly can.  I kid you not.  I don't like my money being played with.  I say again.  Fuck coinbase.

Thanks for this link.  I still don't see anything as far as how I would get my actual cash for the BTC withdrawn though.  I see "Withdrawing bitcoins" which tells me that I can withdraw my BTC to a different btc address.  But it doesn't say how I would actually get my USD withdrawn and if I can put in ANY bank account info and get it automatically sent to the account.  Or am I misunderstanding something?

I don't want to buy anything, I just want the cash.  And I have to say, I hated every experience I've had with Coinbase trying to purcahse.  I tried twice and it took forever and then they cancelled my order both times.  I kind of swore them off.  Is it different as a seller?
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:08:18
So as long as I find someone with whom we agree on terms of payment method, it sounds as if there should be no reason the seller, as well as myself, should not be safe from fraud on behalf of each other, even if I choose to buy from a seller who is far from local.  If I understand correctly.  I was just unsure why I hadn't heard of more people doing that when I read about it.  But unless anyone advises against it for any reason, I think I am going to pursue that particular method.

Thank you for offering me that alternative.  Already checking it out now.
