I've been calling it since the very beginning. Thankfully I saw the signs and got completely out of Bitcoin in mid February. Bitcoin has 0 chance of reaching 9k ever again. Too many variables keeping it this way. Sorry if truth hurts but I've been warning people for past months now and unfortunately no one listens.

I hope you are joking. They are not done bringing Bitcoin down. Once it has reached an acceptable price (hearing 2-3k according to one of my inside sources) it will trade mostly sideways forever.

Futures killed Bitcoin. We will never see even 9k again. Either get completely out of Cryptocurrencies now or move into other coins. George Soros, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Jamie Dimon have won.
Bitcoin is done. Too many powerful people kicking it down.

Not this time. You underestimate the influence of people like George Soros, Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates. They are part of an elite society that goes back hundreds of years and that has shaped and influenced many Nations and many world events. You think any of you have a chance??? I care about you. I care about everyone here. This is going to get ugly very soon. It's time to realize this.
If people listened to me back when I was making my warnings they would be in a better place now. It is foolish to go down with the ship when I show you the life boats.

You will see just like many others have already. You think you or anyone else can beat them? This will only end in tears for all of you. ��

BTC is dead. Its time to move on.

Guys I know it's tough to trust an anon. I know. I don't blame any of you for being highly skeptical. But PLEASE trust me. I am not lying. TPTB are in charge. Not a lie. George Soros has become involved in cryptocurrency recently. Not a lie. Soros is a senior member of TPTB society. Not a lie. They are going to crash this market. Not a lie.

It's just a pump and dump playground now. That's all it's good for.

I'll be drinking on the moon soon enough.

Prepare to see bitcoin drop even further and never recover. Be smart think about your mental and financial well being.
