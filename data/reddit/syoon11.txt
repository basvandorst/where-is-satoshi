Can you recommend mobile LN wallets for ios?

This can never happen unless electricity generation is decentralized. Maybe when solar via 3D printers is possible.

 Next block fees are a quarter USD today, I am not even talking about December. Also, I didn’t once mention on-chain scaling. 
I reiterate: Few people worldwide can afford a quarter USD on fees. My dream when getting into Crypto was so that the world could *use* sound money. I feel a bit betrayed.
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:54:14
Yes. The dream is P2P cash: Not controlled by central banks and nearly free for all.

Even right now, BTC fees are too high to support people in say, rural India. 
The Bitcoin dream is based on its becoming a global, one-world currency. Like the conspiracy NWO coin, but a beautiful mirror opposite. 
Bitcoin as a financial asset, which is only useful for the rich (store of value is not useful for people who do not have value to store) is a nightmare.

Yea. That is my dream/reason for getting into crypto. 
Paying a quarter for the privilege of spending cash, and when BTC moons 10X, having to pay $2 for the privilege of spending cash was not my dream.

I will add one more. 
“Bcash bcash btrash!”
@_date: 2018-09-30 18:00:49
But how can it get there if it isn’t possible now? If/when BTC prices rise, the fees will become even more expensive than it is now.

But open source software allows this. If roger ver sold Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at Bitcoin (BTC) prices... now that would be fraud.

I am curious too. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:35:57
Yes. The difference is that I don’t want to run a node on my computer and connect to *that* with my mobile wallet. 
I just want to download a wallet that works.

The thin wallet requires me to run a node on my computer and connect with that. 
The Spark wallet will allow me to just run an app on my phone. 
Clearly Spark will be easier for people like me that don’t want to run a node. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:56:47
I did my research. There is none. But Spark is promising an easy to use iOS wallet soon. So, once they launch, I will definitely try that. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:49:12
How could one measure or estimate the number of bitcoin users?
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:32:27
That is a “thin” wallet, which means i have to run my node or trust someone with a node. 
Spark, if I understand, is going to be its own node.
