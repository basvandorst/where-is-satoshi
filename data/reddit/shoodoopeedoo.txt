How about tax evasion. Specifically capital gains taxes? When moving money around, whales (everyone really) can save a lot of money cashing in and out of tether rather than fiat.   
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:18:38
You know it's a volunteer system for crypto right now right? Bad guys don't volunteer this information to the IRS. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:46:19
Tax collection works like this: (To make this simple, lets say you are a contractor and no tax was withheld)
1. You get paid from your employer. 2. The employer turns in a report to the IRS showing how much income you earned. 3. You file your taxes, and turn in a payment with what amount you've calculated your taxes to be. 4. The IRS looks at the amount you've paid, based on the amount you've claimed that you earned, and cross-references it to what they have on file from your employer to make sure you are claiming the right amount of income, and paying the right amount of tax. 
See? Without step 2, the IRS would be blind. You could say you made far less than you were actually paid and the IRS would be none the wiser. 
Same thing with interest earned through financial institutions, income from inheritances, and income from the sale of property. All of those events generate a report that is turned in to the IRS, who can cross reference it against your next incoming tax return. 
**In crypto there is no report generated to the IRS.**
And the IRS has been trying to change that. There's been a fight going on between the IRS and exchanges to release user information so the IRS can see who has exchanged fiat for crypto and crypto for fiat. This is so they know who to tax, and how much. The IRS has routinely been denied, except when Coinbase agreed to give them information on all transactions over $20k from 2013 to 2015.  The fight no doubt is going to continue, but for now the IRS has no real way of discovering historical individual transactions unless they tap or audit everyone's bank accounts for crypto/exchange activity. 
 
Now, in reading more about this stuff, from tax experts to quotes directly from IRS reps, they omit these details above and all say some scary shit like this: 


Sounds pretty heavy right? Well, **it is because they're trying to scare you in to action**. You should *Preemptively* pay your *Possible* taxes. You *Could* be breaking the law. *But we don't know yet how the IRS is going to find out about your crypto actions, because they don't have a legal way to get detailed history reports yet.* (They don't actually state that last part, but it's true.)
Point is, yes, they are putting out more and more content about how you should be paying your capital gains taxes, but they have not had any legal way to monitor your liability yet.

I think you're confused by me wording the term cashing in-and-out. It's not like you are exchanging tether for fiata cash, but rather exchanging tether for crypto amounts.  The government  Maybe able to monitor your fianc bank account, but not your anonymous tether accounts. Unless I'm wrong and somehow tether is now governed and monitored by the government?

Sentencing always takes in to consideration character. It works both ways. For example, first-time offenders with clean backgrounds and good support systems get lighter sentences. If you engage in high-level felonies, that involve defrauding the government, allowing for illegal drug trade and eventual consumption (see: poisoning of your own society) and also are rumored to have been involved in murder for hire, you're not getting much good will from your jury.

So your opinion is that the current legal system that Ross was tried in is invalid. That's cool. Keep your opinion. However factually you are incorrect about said legal system.  
And as a side note, yes in my opinion, your opinion makes you dense. The legal system may not be perfect but its how it is due to millions of legal cases. How you feel, which goes against the tried and true logic of this legal system, is not the best solution as the law of averages has shown.  You may feel strongly about your opinion but when laid against real world situations it cracks in the face of logical applications.

Let's say I have learned that you Might be a child molester. You hang around with known pedophiles. You interact with them online. You communicate with them about their fantasies.  But I only have a he said she said argument that you actually are a child molester yourself. Now, you get wrapped up on some other similar shady business,., let's say kidnapping. You lured a kid away from their parents at the local park. We can prove that you did that much, and you put up a good or a bad defense. I don't care. The jury finds you guilty. Now in sentencing I have to really evaluate how much intent you had and what you may have done if not caught. I need to look at your CHARACTER and I notice that, wow, look at that, you are affiliated with some really creepy fucks. I can't prove you molested anyone.... Yet. But I know that you so far act in a way that's congruent with the actions of somone who shouldn't be treated like this was all one big misunderstanding. You're a creep and in this case for the crimes you have been found guilty of I'm gonna throw the book at you to keep society safe. THAT'S how character is considered during the sentencing phase.
Also, consider this: If character was not a factor then why do defense attorneys of gangsters tell their clients to wear a suit and tie, and tell the defendants home boys to stay out of the courthouse.  They want their clients character to appear clean. But you can't hide allegations levied during the trial, only try to minimize them.
