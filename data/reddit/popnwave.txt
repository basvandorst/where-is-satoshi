I pray for the day I can ditch paypal for the occasional vinyl I like to buy on ebay and/or discogs.

The audio can be either, but you are correct the video was analog!

Mmmm when you are the juggernaut you can squeeeze more from your users.

I've been on there in some capacity since 1998, hardly use it any more to sell stuff because of the way they shove PayPal down your throat. They ran Yahoo off the map and I don't know of any competitors that are even close :(

PayPal is a crappy, crappy service. It's like doing biz with the mafia and be happy if you've never been screwed over by a transaction with them. 
Of all the entities to support this, I am LEAST excited about them.

Love the idea.. I might buy one just for giggles ;)

The older versions work just fine. If you got the store now, the function is removed and the only way to get it is to jailbreak and get the version in the Cydia store.

Lol if that guy still goes to the school on his G+ profile that's spitting distance from my work place.

If it's legit the tax implications make my head hurt. Better cash out some more to cover insurance and everything else.
