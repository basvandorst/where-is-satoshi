Whoa 7500
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:40:54
Haha.  My username expires in 72 hours.  No one shorts BTC for long, not now anyway!

No answer, pigs are asleep in bed but the luau is ready!

Lolololol this pig is cooked.  Don’t believe me? Pierre and Ed climbed up a hill.

Good on you but you bought at the right time
Your story is harmful.  Op is considering looting his retirement to chase a speculative and volatile rally.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:34:03
Ooo all the way to 7,280 after my post. Nice job pumpers.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:07:44
I agree above 7500 this week
If not, down now maybe decent sell off who knows 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:35:48
Max and Jules held hands
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:42:44
No, because I’ll use a stop loss.
You’re reading about rich amateurs who don’t understand trading.  A professional hedger can employ a short BTC strat and would have only lost small tiny percentages of their risk capital
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:49:47
Mission control calling, so do we need to shake any stragglers out up to 7,500 or is 7,454.16 good enough?
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:44:31
Back here in America things work like this:  sell BTC said the math genius.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:24:32
Yes professionals can read a chart
Log wants to roast pigs who think log growth isn’t enough
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:03:57
The big smart folks know log growth is quite enough for now and it’s a good time to sell high.  Winthrop checked the chart and advised our clients interested in FCOJ to sell up to 7,500
Having said that:
Above 7,500 this week would kick off a true mathematical bubble — it CAN happen, maybe enough money exists to

Most coin is hodl’Ed and not for sale. Market is manipulated for lack of a better term.  Sentiment drives buyers to chase it.
Low supply churned over and over again push price higher for low low cost.
If the market is worth a 100 billion at 5,000 and you buy all the coin, say $500k worth to bring it to 5,100, voila! Your purchase of 500k just raised BTC by $2 billion...on paper!!!  Those numbers are just as an example.  So, NO, it’s not like $40B of fiat was introduced To the market.
Same on downside.  Value gets ruined as sellers rush for the exit door.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:45:14
Ho, ladies and germs:  We have a market!!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:20:36
Wtf ur about to get schooled
Sell now spooky 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:46:49
Anyway the idea goes invalid in 72 hours if we don’t make it to 7425.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:11:36
Sounds violent 
No chance you might wish to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:48:17
I’m not the market
If we hold 7500 then I’m bearish
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:54:04
Thanks Rev! Helpful info.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:41:26
Next stop below 6k, Choo choo! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:05:38
7500 reached!!

Mining one coin uses the same amount of electricity that an entire home uses in about a week... let that sink in.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:29:04
You are seriously crazy if you don’t consider selling some of your bitcoin at this level at this time.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:42:02
Someone posted article here just now
It was on motherboard vice website today
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:33:01
Yes many hodlers piggyback genesis who won’t sell.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:09:12
I needed some room to get out, therefore start selling at 7425
We topped at 7500 which was my upper limit sell
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:42:51
Nah if we break 7500 it’s all clear skies bubble, fuck log growth, we would see 10k in no time if 7500 breaks
Contrarily... if 7500 holds here it’s not good

It’s just a useful username at the Top
I should have said sell up to 7500

Not theory, anecdote.  I know early stage hodlers, some quite connected to the anti establishment movement, and trust me you don’t want these folks accumulating power.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:02:48
Maybe over a billion transactions per day globally
Every day!!!
A billion, let that sink in
Do you realize how much money runs through forex daily
currently?  Trillions of dollars
Btc couldn’t support it!
Btc is wasting electricity running pointless hashing bro
Just sayin

You could have set a stop market order to get back in at 4,795.... it’s a stop-gains-from-being-lost-loss order :$
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:37:22
From the article:
“Every single transaction consumes a shocking 215 KWh per day, an amount of energy that is enough to support Americans living on 901 KWh per month.”
This isn’t good news.
Reporting from reality, this is “sell_BTC_7425” reporting live from paradise.

My voice is same as yours.  You can offer logical responses.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:22:29
Check my username, we hit 7425, we sold lots up there. Did you buy up there?
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:32:26
It’s my username.   The funny part is that someone created the buy version of this user name right after me. Thus, we have a market at 7425 if we get there now or soon!
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:50:17
US dollars by the way. For reference: we are just above 7,200 at this time.

Sell now

@_date: 2017-11-03 09:18:49
I picked 7,425 so you’d have time and space to sell those coins folks!!!
Did anyone sell up there?  We hit 7,500 on the nose!
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:38:18
Hel Helen hellyeah! I’m not saying it was aliens...
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:50:21
Idk, you should talk to the corrupt insiders at the exchange who have inside info on order flow.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:04:03
Think of it this way:  If you got enough anti establishment folks together in a virtual pgp room nearly 10 years ago, they would convince themselves they could do with BTC what the hunt brothers failed to do with the silver market, and goldbugs failed to do with gold.
Bringing down America has been in the works for decades, and such folks saw BTC as an important part of that plan.
Hodlers are being used but smart ones have become (and will become going forward) rich, at the expense of simultaneously enriching forces that don’t understand big picture politics and favor chaos.
Oh there’s so much more.
Ask yourself who is pro America and you’ll have your answer.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:07:52
As it turns out those BTC are like precious fine art (fragile - it’s Italian!), cost big energy bucks to mine!!

Trend has been towards electronic, and the billion per day figure is the non cash amount.
As for BTC’s future, it’s speculation on the first implementation of a groundbreaking technology.
Some don’t agree with off chain transactions.  Those need to be POS’ed so it’s a hack.
You’ve raised a good question and hopefully a researcher will produce estimates for those power grubbing bankers and their yachting events!

Whut? We just topped 7,500

That’s right new hodlers, they didn’t tell you that each coin uses the power of a nice home for a week!

Ding dong this is pig roasting service at your door now.  Anyone home?
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:15:57
Traders have a different mindset
You’re trying to beat the market
Professionals do this
They’re professional
And I say this as someone bearish from 7425-7500
What if you’re wrong and You sell and the price go straight up from here? There’s no way to know.  Your strategy would need to account for this  possibility 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:32:05
Wait to see how downtrend shapes up
Trade has to work first
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:16:22
1) no you need people willing to buy for the quantity you are selling, and that will cascade down depending on size of order and order type. Look up market order vs limit order.  Market order gets you out now at any price vs limit order gets you out at a certain price only if someone is willing to buy at that price.  Market order is thus risky since price can tank and get you out disfavorably, and limit order is risky since market can run away and never fill your order.
2) never store long term on exchange, only keep there what you need
3) Look if you want to trade this is what you need to know don’t listen to anyone else who tells you differently.
First thing is that you need to be well-capitalized and a half to be money that you can afford to lose that’s really important. The next thing is that you have to leave your ego at the door. Training is not about making any productions at all.It’s quite the opposite. Your only goal as a traitor is to be on the right side of a trade . If the trade goes against you you need to get out. A seasoned a traitor is likely to advise you to use very tight stops. Bigger traders may have a different strategy for spreading out limit orders. But in all cases you need to manage risk. You have absolutely no way of knowing for sure what’s going to happen whether upper down. Buyers or sellers can step in to any degree of any possible time and liquidity can dry up at any possible time. There could be a news release that would drop the price largely, and if you’re using leverage that can really screw you over. To be very honest I would look at trading a something to do for fun with a very small amount of Money that you can afford to lose because most trainers are going to lose anyway. Unless you have $5 million to play around with trading it’s probably better that you just dollar cost average in pie little bit a bit coin at a time I’d rather see you do that then waste your life away trying to trade because training is extremely difficult it sucks your soul away can take away opportunity cost that you could’ve used for other ventures. Another words he really shouldn’t do it
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:28:07
So you’re comfortable with BTC’s inefficient, wasteful design?
You would need the smartest people in the room on BTC’s side going forward to ensure superior tech won’t overtake it.

Get used to the pump and dump because that’s all you’re going to see at these levels at this time. Everyone is just chasing price now.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:36:00
I believe they’re already dead, reincarnated, burned again, and long gone since 7,150++.  If anything, clear the 7,500 suckers out.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:37:45
Support is diagonal
Thus the price is time dependent 
Hard and fast means lower price
Who knows maybe only 2000 point correction? I’m guessing
I’ll probably get bored and delete this account too even if 7500 is the top!!
Good trading crypto bro!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:07:03
I know bro
I’m saying
If the global banking system is doing say a billion, then if btc did a billion a day (!) then it would consume a billion times one House weeks of electricity daily
Clearly banks don’t use 1,000,000,000 x house for one week, every day
Per transaction banks use way less electricity
Banks do way more transactional volume. Btc wouldn’t handle it

@_date: 2017-11-03 09:55:24
Great question idk
But as point of ref
How many transactions does global bank system process per day?
Take the BTC per-transaction figure and multiply 
I bet that’s way more than banks use
I.e. BTC uses more per transaction (idk if that’s the case but maybe?)
Good question!  CAn you research it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:28:14
