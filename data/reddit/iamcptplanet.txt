Just thought I'd mention, I just got a similar-appearing e-mail from ATBCoin, though it may just be spam.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:10:16
I just got the same. Never had any interaction with them of which I'm aware.

There are also several presentations on exactly what bitcoins are, how they work, etc. but I don't have any on hand--some quick googling 'what is bitcoin' 'bitcoin explanation', etc. might yield some good results.

I don't want to be a debby downer, but if you're mining at a rate of 0.000003BTC/hour, converting to weeks, you're looking at 
So you'll need almost a year's worth of running the computer to get 1BTC. You can also check possible returns on  or 
Now, I don't want to discourage you, but you need to be realistic about your prospects--this is almost exactly the reason I didn't spend the money to build a graphics card rig a year-6 months ago. The returns weren't enough to justify the investment for me.

I'm in a similar boat to you (starving grad student)--I've taken the plunge and pre-ordered an ASIC rig (though it may not arrive until the heat death of the universe, if ever), and bought my first BTC a few days ago (which I know isn't a great idea atm, but I needed to get SOMETHING in). 
Even though I'd been paying attention to bitcoins for a while in late 2010, grad school caught up to me and I lost track. I finally decided that I needed to either get involved now, or forget about it.
Here's to (calculated?) risk!

Generally, I begin w/ a discussion of what currency really is, and how it's fundamentally based on faith (with some exceptions), and then explaining the exchange mechanisms, algorithms, creation process, etc. for bitcoin, and comparing it to a 'normal' currency. I try to set it up, so that at the end, I can do a compare/contrast between a 'normal' currency, and BTC, so I can outline the similarities, differences, advantages, disadvantages, etc. I try to leave the 'value' of bitcoins out of it, and focus on the fundamental process. After I'm fairly confident they have a grasp on how it WORKS, I mention that, at the moment, it's valued x, some people think this, some people think that, etc.

Wow, thanks so much kindly stranger!

I haven't sorted through all the math of it, but my understanding is that since any individual transaction should be trackable via the blockchain, you can check and compare your results with theirs to make sure a given transaction should have/won loss.
If you're saying that the odds on the '50%' aren't actually 50%, I'd have to do the math to be sure, but I'm fairly sure that the '50%' is generated by the chance of having the required number above/below--i.e. it's not based on statistics over time, but instead the probability of a single outcome based on the information contained in the transaction data. 
If there's anyone who could simplify this/use more math, or if I'm wrong, please correct me.

I'm relatively new to the intricacies of BTC, so take my what I say with a grain of salt, but my understanding is:
1)If you use an online-wallet (i.e. one stored/generated by a website), there is a greater chance of having the account compromised in the same way that any online account could be compromised. This means that the wallet is at risk if (a) the site is compromised sufficiently, or (b) your password is compromised, or both.
2) If you use a client-based wallet (i.e. one stored/generated on YOUR computer) the risk is essentially the same as the risk of having any data on your computer compromised--ex: if you have a wallet with no password, no encryption, backed up as wallet.dat on your desktop, and someone gains access to your desktop, your entire wallet, and all stored addresses are at risk. 
By the same token for (2), if you keep a pile of gold sitting on your dining room table, someone could pick the lock on your door/break it down, and walk in and take the gold. 
Overall, the safety is ~~primarily~~ YOUR responsibility, especially with regards to a client-based wallet. There are safer methods of storage (or so I hear), but I'm not expert enough to speak to them.
All this being said, I'd read over this  and it'll probably answer your questions better than I.
Hope this helps!

I'll try and answer your questions to the best of my ability, but be sure to check out the wiki to get more info 
(1)I've used coinbase to by my first. Still waiting on it--If you have a friend who already has some BTC, might be easier to get it from them.
(2)To my understanding, they will be stored on the site you buy them from, and so, are only as safe as the site itself is--As soon as mine come through, I'm going to transfer them to my personal client-based wallet (be sure to research the difference between client-based and online wallets). Generally, if you are careful, client-based is safer, but all the responsibility is on you.
(3)They are 'physical' bitcoins from way back when, but they're sort of a novelty item--they have the value of X BTC, but aren't inherently any different. They're currently far more expensive than just buying a real bitcoin.
(4) I believe Mt.Gox accepts wire transfers, but you'd have to check each specific site. There are also a few faucets (sites that provide small amounts of free BTC), such as  I would get a small amount to play with, get the feel for transfers, wallets, etc. before making the plunge. As far as buying large amounts......It's entirely up to you. The price might go up, might go down, who knows.
Hope this helps!

There are still a few BTC faucets running, so if you want to get some BTC to get into the game, practice exchanges, work with wallets, etc, I'd check around--here's one to get you started  since it's the only functional one I know of off the top of my head. Got my first 0.001BTC ever from it!

I've explained a little bit to some family and friends--Those who've understood the system tend to be really excited about it. Its definitely made paying back some friends who live across the country much easier:P

Unless you're willing to mention the conversion rate to USD (i.e. 'shall not exceed 400,000,000USD in total value..'), I can't see a way to word a contract that takes the value of BTC into account, since the value is a result of comparison with other currencies. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:09:40
I've seen it take less or more--it depends on the specific transaction--This is one of the arguments for LTC as a partner cryptocurrency (faster confirmation times). 
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:56:43
At this point, considering your available funds, I'd say the risk far outweighs the potential reward--Instead, as others have mentioned, I'd try to do freelance work that you wouldn't have otherwise sought and get paid in BTC. That way, if it crashes, you lose time, but not your life savings.
Edit: Also, per running your computer for 3 days--be sure you're not LOSING money doing that, as a result of increased computer uptime and power draw. Whether or not you are would depend entirely on your system specs, electricity cost, rate of return (which appears to be about 0.000003BTC/hour, or .000306USD/hour).
