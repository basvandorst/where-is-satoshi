This is possible. It’s also possible that, with significant use of lightning, there will be fewer on chain txs and this will clear up congestion. This will lower fees.

I don’t see people paying for services like YouTube and FaceBook. They’re too used to them being free. Even if the payments are more convenient, this doesn’t change. 
I agree that micropayments are a cool solutions for things like Netflix, Spotify, etc. I don’t see them as a way to replace advertising. Advertising exists because people don’t want to pay for the service. Making payments more convenient doesn’t solve this issue.

I think micropayments are a great solution, but not for everyone. People will never want to pay for a service like YouTube. 
I don’t think people will block the scripts needed to run the small mining operations on their machines. Most people don’t have these scripts blocked by default, and I don’t think they would be annoyed enough at the mining (if done properly) to be incentivized to block them. 
Yes, our machines are much less efficient at mining. However, we don’t need to worry about being as efficient. Just about whether or not we can recoup the cost of lost advertisements with expected mining rewards. 
In essence, the mining *is* a micropayment, just less in-your-face from the user’s perspective.

That’s really cool. I wonder how it’s working out for them.

Mine is 10,000. It goes up as you use it for a while (and also if you connect your bank account and give them enough identification to forever identify you and all your family members).

You're right. Small but important.

This is now what is stands for.

It is safe to reuse the same address to receive multiple payments before spending that address. The address is usually a hashed and encoded form of a public key. Only when spending *from* this address is the public key revealed and then you don't want to reuse it. 
My suggestion:
1. Create a receive address and post it along with the QR code (QR codes are great)
2. At the end of the month, or some other time period, sweep the funds from this address into the addresses receiving the tips. 
3. Post a new address and QR code.

Most of us are excited and also worried about Segwit2X coming down the pike. Not so excited about that.

Somebody mentioned that BCC was already an abbreviation for something else in the bitcoin world. I'll see if I can find it. People are using BCH (Bitcoin CasH) as an alternative abbreviation. 
EDIT: BCC already refers to BitConnect on many exchanges, such as kraken, who may or may not have been the first to coin BCH. Either way, it's what they're going with. [Source. ](

Sure! It's a complicated system, and it helps if we all know what's going on. 
Strangely, I feel like the entire Bitcoin system is still orders of magnitude less complex than the system for just making a simple VISA payment.

It is recognized as invalid. It must be sent again. Your funds have essentially been returned to you.

Not a big deal. Bitcoin was designed to deal with this sort of thing. Let's say Alice, in Asia, successfully solves the mining problem and broadcasts her solution to the network. Bob, in Brazil, also solves the problem at roughly the same time and then broadcasts it. 
Alice and Bob are far enough away from each other on the globe that, regionally, Asia will accept Alice's as the true block and Brazil will accept Bob's because those are the chains that they receive first. Everything else is probably a mixed bag. Either way, we have a split in the blockchain. 
This would be a big problem if it weren't anticipated from the beginning. Satoshi implemented a way to decide what the "true" blockchain is. The longest chain wins (EDIT: longest, and VALID chain wins). 
So, whoever mines the next block will place it on his own chain and broadcast it, thereby deciding the true chain. 
This is also why we should wait for more than a few confirmations on a transaction. In the event of a temporary fork (not super uncommon), certain nodes will experience blocks with 1 confirmation being invalidated.

How does this prevent the attacker from submitting the modified source code with Wladmir’s PGP signature to OpenTimestamp?

The tx amount has no bearing on whether or not it’s accepted. The fee does. Fees are particularly low right now. Anecdotally, I’ve paid about 1 or 2 cents for my last couple txs. They were both confirmed within a half hour.

You will have both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. This is because your keys will unlock coins on both blockchains (pre-split blockchains are identical).  HOWEVER, you do not get free money. Overall, the value of your BTC and BCC coins will be equal to or less than your BTC coins now. 
[Andreas Explains]( 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:23:25
You don't get free BCC. It's worth comes out of the worth of BTC. So if it's worthless, we shouldn't see much of a drop in BTC. But if not, BTC will take a hit. 
This is why it's so important to control your private keys for the split. Companies like CoinBase are planning on getting rid of all their BCC (as they publicly said in their email to customers) and this leaves users with only the value of their bitcoin. 
[Andreas says it better. ](

I would like to get something out of it, but I don't see that happening. Either BCH (aka BCC) is literally worthless, or it takes away from the value of BTC (by the same amount you gained in BCH—we can look at the event as a massive inflation, where there is now twice as much currency and the value gets divided between the two proportional to their worth). 
I guess if there is some worth to BCH then it would be valuable to have both, since the entire community would be undervaluing it and we could make some money by holding. TBH I'll probably end up doing this just because I'm too last to figure out how to sell it. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:04:30
You'd never throw it away, but you might unload it asap if you believe it's price will somehow drop below what ppl think it's initially worth. Admittedly, with so much negative hype about BCH, that might not be possible.

Important clarifications: the lightning network is not a sidechain. It is most commonly referred to as a new "layer" on top of bitcoin. The current implementation of the lightning network does not record most of the transactions on any chain at all. 
Most importantly, the lightning network does *NOT* require you to relinquish control of your private keys. While there are some concerns regarding increased centralization in access points to the LN, it is still a 100% trustless model.
