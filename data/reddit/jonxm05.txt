I found your argument interesting but I think your looking at one analogy and coming to a conclusion based on it. "OK I'm sure loosing lots money didn't helped either"
Here's my analogy. Do you remember about 10 years back when Nokia (I think they were the first) brought out a mobile phone with camera. Everyone was shocked why would we ever need a camera on a phone. I remember discussions at work where people mentioned a what waste of money and  why???......  10 years later could you imagine Smartphones without cameras. Where would Facebook, WhatsApp, instagram be today 
Bitcoin is not about what you can do with it today or tomorrow but what will be dome with it in 10 years from now....

That's a bit of a unfair comparison. Kidnappers collecting suitcases full of cash is more risky then collecting Bitcoins over then net. The ability to commit crime and profit from it  "anomalously"  is a problem that affects Bitcoin's image in public opinion. Is also something the Media makes a lot of noise about.  So yes IMHO it's bad for Bitcoin

I know it sounds crazy but it's safe. The chances of generating the same address twice are so small it theoretically can never happen.
Here a good video on the topic

Hi 
I'm not a Twitter user where or how do you access to see this live?  
thanks

We need to get him on TV / YouTube in a  debate with Andreas Antonopoulos or someone that can really contradict the shit he is spreading.
What amazes me is how much talk time they giving the guy on mainstream media without having a representative to offer contradicting argument

Sorry it technically I was incorrect I'm not a developer.  
I based this on the article I linked under section *"Why does XBT have to represent a full unit of bitcoin?"* 
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:06:36
There is a problem with this graphic,  XBT in not and can not be 1 bit. XBT is part of the attempt to have bitcoin added to the  ISO standard for trade. This has to stay in the same unit as the bookkeeping does it since the bitcoin protocol functions in BTC and therefore 1 XBT will always equal 1 BTC. 
More information in this article 
That aside I agree that usage has to move to bits it is the only way forward so mass adoption can happen. More than 2 digits after the decimal place is just to complicated for most people to work with when to comes to money. 
Don't necessary like the symbol used in this graphic

The idea I always wondered if possible was in place of forever raising the difficulty which at the end actually has no point except use up more electricity.  We could develop an API system that would allow third parties to purchase processing power from the mining pool. The API would define sending work and getting results.   The third party would pay for the work by bitcoin which in turn could be rewarded to the miners.  I'm sure there are big organizations out there that need number crunching done and would love to outsource it cheaply. Just an Idea :)

Increase the block size allowing more than 7 transactions per second and then give the doubters one less thing to complain about when talking about the bitcoin in the media.  Less criticism more adoption. More adoption the more the price will rise and so will market cap.

Continue thinking like that the only logical outcome will be the destruction bitcoin. Talk, debate, compromise
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:24:44
Why have you made it personal. Because I think that  when two groups cant agree then compromise is required to achieve a mutual goal. I don't consider myself an enemy because of that. Why do you?     
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:33:22
Why does nobody like Jaxx? I have found it very good and its also cross platform.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:55:01
That's bullshit. Life is compromise. Nothing is perfect. We need to push for bettter but sometimes we need to find the best traidoff to move forward, especially doing nothing leads to even worse 
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:39:42
Please enlighten me. I try and keep up to date on developments. To my knowledge the only current scaling under development is Segwit.  What other goals are you referring to   If you are referring to the lightning network then that is  a whole other discussion.        
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:18:41
Sounds exactly like just like Tone Vays talking about alt coins. he refers to Pets.com same way as Tone always refers to Auroracoin. 
Proves that extremists viewpoints don't mix with technology. its all about trail and error some ideas work some don't. Never disregard another persons opinions.

So that why evaluate which solution solves the problem quicker. Its sometime good to implement a temporary fix while you work on long term solutions   
@_date: 2016-06-02 13:10:29


Increasing current capacity 100% is not trivial. Even if it does not achieve any meaningful short term scaling of which i'm sure it will,  its a small price to pay for peace.  
In order for bitcoin to replace central banks it would have grow from the ground up. This can only happen through mass adoption and will not happen if it fails to scale before it out the door, We have competition out there and they are gaining ground.

This is disgusting behavior and an insult to this community
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:51:31
At long last a discussion in compromise, this is the only logical way forward. If only core would support this all the drama could go away.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:18:27
I would assume we may see am increase in price as victims of the attack start looking to buy bitcoin to pay the ransom 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:13:38
Next time someone says that there are regulations and controls guarding the the flow of USD just say yes we saw with the Panama papers just how well that's working.    
@_date: 2016-05-30 10:38:02
Disgusting that conversion here is developing into personal attacks on people. Diffidence of opinion is OK. Making jokes out of there business decisions is just not right     
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:41:19
So if not now then when?  It's an inevitable  step in order to move forward.

I'm really confused by Mr Gates and the storm of comments related to digital currencies. Over the past few weeks he done multiple interviews where digital currencies have been discussed. I have heard him point out his opinions regarding  issues with bitcoin, volatility, lack of abilities for charge-backs and I see his points. These issues a small and are all fixable compared to what bitcoin has gone through already, with a bit of time and innovation all these issues will be solved through this open permission-less system. Free for all to participate   
Bitcoin is by far one of the greatest technologies of out time and already has the upper hand in regards to funding, development,  numbers etc ..   It has the potential to be everything Mr. Gates wants digital currencies will be. So why is he fighting us and not joining us.  Is there more to this that I have missed it feels like his competing with us.
