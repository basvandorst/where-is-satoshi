You are living the dream.
I learned about bitcoin last year when 1BTC was worth ~4USD. I wish I had invested at that price.

That's what I said.
If you have a keylogger on your computer, you already lost.
I don't know what to say, this is just plain stupid. How can anything on a computer be safe if someone can easily install malware on your machine?
Plus it seems you had physical assess to the computer so you were able to disable every security mechanism.

You broke the encryption using a key-logger?  Congratulations

Haha, it's getting a bit off topic now ;)
Again that's why you set a password and lock you pc when you are afk.
But what if your roommate knocks you down while your computer is unlocked? Should we start wearing helmets? Full Armory?
A dead man's switch would probably the best solution

You described the situation at a public computer and I don't think that's what OP is talking about. You should NEVER store sensible information a public or office computer.
Otherwise you are completely right.

The file is encrypted using 128bit AES using your master password. If you choose a strong password, it's very likely that encryption will take a unreasonable long time (longer than the age of the universe I think.)
TL;DR: It's one of the safest ways to store passwords and keys

I understand your point but I think it's not valid in this case. You should be able to control who have assess to your computer. Maybe start encrypting your drives, set a password when you leave your desk.

I never used my second screen as much as now, displaying the charts
