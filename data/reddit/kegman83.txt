Pretty much every single book, article, and essay I've read on the subject shows it was just as much of a surprise to everyone at the top as it was to everyone at the bottom.  There was about a decade of the Federal government throwing anything they could at it hoping deflation would stop.  Whole financial dynasties stopped and never recovered.  On paper, a tax cut at the top and a protectionist tariff for certain goods was supposed to work, but failed spectacularly.
If it was a centralized, planned coup of the financial system at the time, it was probably the poorest planned one in existence. The richest people at the time were also the regulators and cabinet members.
There wasnt any true solutions to it until the outbreak of WWII.  Which Im sure people can say is another conspiracy theory too, but they are wrong.

Bitcoin behaves like real estate, specifically beachfront real estate. You cant make any more beachfront and the amount of buyers increases daily.  If you take the price of, say California beachfront property and compress it to the timeframe bitcoin was around, you get the same pattern we see today.  Namely small variations in price but an overall pattern of exponential growth.  And no one is calling beachfront real estate a bubble.

To be honest, a centralized exchange software was easier to implement and understand.  Its also harder to hack because vulnerabilities can be predicted and dealt with.
With a decentralized exchange/wallet the software first has to be created and tested into oblivion. Next you have to create the entire lightening network because there is no batching single wallet/exchange transactions in theory. This would, if popular, clog the network and is exploitable. 
There's all sorts of shit that can go wrong here. You are basically testing alpha software on a network that only recently went on the main net.  So yeah, it couldnt be done before but wallet/decentralized exchange combos are the natural next thing in crypto.

Well Div of Trading and Markets is in charge of broker-dealers and clearing agencies.  Div of Corporate Finance is tasked with proper disclosure to investors.
In the room were the Winklevoss Twins and counsel, BATs global markets chief and counsel.  State Street ETF products specialist, KCG Holdings global head (algo and institutional trading) ConvergEx which specializes in institutional investor clients (IE, governments, IRAs, pensions), Susquehanna International (Global quant, high speed trading group), and last Ropes and Gray global law group out of Boston.
IMHO, these people dont meet when they are discussion IF the ETF is approved, but HOW it will be implemented. Im imagine State Street will be in charge of the ETF. They run SPY, GLD and pretty much every major ETF you've heard of.
BATs global market head is there because thats the exchange its traded on.  I imagine Ropes and Gray represent them, or are possibly independent outside council.
You've got two quant traders in KCG and Susquehanna.  They are either outside advisors, or consultants to gauge how the market will trade COIN.
Convergex probably wants to know the make-up of the ETF to see if it meets institutional portfolio requirements for retirement accounts, etc.
TL;DR These are people that have to be in the room after the decision is made, not before.  Now they are just trying to figure out the HOW, not the WHY.

Bitcoin doesnt have a political party.  It doesnt have a country. Democrats use them, Republicans use them.  Communists in Cuba use them.  Socialists in Venezuela use them.  Members of various different tribes in Africa use them.  The old, the young, all own bitcoin.
When you put on that stupid fucking hat, you turn off half your audience in America.  Or worse yet, you gain the attention of reporters who see you as a target of opportunity.

Think of it this way.  You can buy $500k of bitcoin, approve the ETF, get thrown in prison and have your proceeds taken from you.  Or...you can work through your 5 year term, and then when its up, go work for the COIN ETF as an advisor and make 10 times as much.

Take away the tax incentives and I doubt this is true. But Im not really here to argue politics.  I just dont think hoping people donate to charity is a feasible way of running a country going forward.  There are more billionaires than ever, and none of them are giving a ton of money to charity.  Where's the Rockefellers building libraries or the Carnegies supporting the local theatre?  Anyone in the non-profit industry can tell you its harder to get money these days, not easier.


Thats the thing.  There simply werent 90 year olds on the street in 1935.  Average life expectancy was less than 60 years old.  People are living longer and longer.  They need to eat, and charity isnt going to cut it.  Charity is good for short term crises, not 20+ years of subsistence. I dont believe Peter Thiel or Warren Buffet would give away 30% of their net worth out of the goodness of their hearts.  The world is different now.

Your dollar bill now functions as most functions a bank provides, namely good record keeping.  Everyone's dollars are like little banks now, communicating with each other every time there is a transaction.

Any change to the stability of the world is usually a net positive for bitcoin, and things like gold.
It used to be that when the world blew up somewhere, the world flocked to the dollar.  People buy the dollar, dollar increases in value causing deflation.  Well thats shit is over now, especially if the US experiences a constitutional crisis.
A tariff on mexican goods is a net negative for consumers in the US and positive for bitcoin.  While I am highly invested in real estate, and the stock market, I dont trust Trump to increase the value of either.  I fully expect interest rates to rise and governments to buy less and less treasuries, especially if Trump says every debt is negotiable.  US Treasuries arent.  
A US Treasury default would have devastating effects on the world economy for a dozen reasons.  Whether it would be a net positive for bitcoin is hard to say.  You are talking about defaulting on trillions of dollars.  Positive in the short run, but negative when people realize their dollars dont buy shit anymore.  Bitcoin could be $50k by that point, but that doesnt mean anything when the dollar is basically worthless.
Threatening CA is amusing considering its like 30% of the nationals wealth.  You can shit on CA all day for being liberal, but at the end of the day they are worth 2 Texases or a dozen Alabamas.  But by all means, shut off funding for the ports and airports.  See what happens.
If by some miracle we dont end up in a war with China, expect bitcoin to increase in value simply due to GOP policies of tax cuts and increased spending.  That devalues the dollar quite a bit.
Watch for March when the debt ceiling comes due.  The GOP used to use it as a threat, but never would pull the trigger in a million years.  Its my belief Trump will, and shit will go south real quick for the US and bitcoin will skyrocket in the short term.

I just dont see it, in my opinion.  There is nothing in the history of the chinese government to show they want a laissez-faire approach to their economy.  China is all about centralized control of everything.  Thats the antithesis of bitcoin.  China got to where it was mainly through currency manipulation.  It was only recently that they let the currency float on the market.
Replacing the yuan with a rapidly appreciating currency like bitcoin would devastate cheap chinese labor.  I get that this guy isnt taking centralized control seriously, stating that the government agent sent to the exchanges just reads the newspaper all day, but that can easily change to a very angry government soldier in 24 hours.

Im not Indian myself, but I have quite a few Indian friends from the mainland.  You are correct, its first use is ceremonial. However, they dont toss it after the ceremony or pawn it.  Thats the safety net.  It just so happens to be a status symbol as well.  Every year during Dwali (sp?) my friends moms would go on gold buying sprees.  Nothing huge, just rings, earings, and necklaces. Maybe an ounce or two at the end of the day.  Every Indian mom would do this in that neighborhood.  They'd go straight to the safe.
India as a country is a gold sponge.  Lots of gold comes in and it rarely leaves.  Every family has some sort of precious metal squirreled away.  Take that and times it by a billion or so and gold confiscation doesnt become easy.

Pre-mined operates in the same manor as an IPO. In an IPO a certain amount of stock is held back, usually for owners and employees, while the rest is distributed to the public.  Any coin that has an pre-mine is hard-pressed to prove they arent a security.  If your token has utility and is not just purely a store of value, then why keep a horde for yourself?

Well just personally working under Mozilo, and Countrywide in general, there wasnt a soul in the office who didnt know LOs werent doctoring apps.  Not that it really matters, as there were no doc, no income loans available.  He, and the entire executive department knew the product was shit and they packaged it and sent it to Fannie-Mae to get funded anyways.
Before anyone thinks Angelo Mozilo was an angel hes banned from being an officer or director in any public company for life. Yeah, he didnt go to jail, but both him and the SEC know he was guilty as fuck, but they knew every document involved in proving that was shredded long ago.

Human beings curate things. Its human nature.  Its causation/correlation here. If people covet inflationary currency, they'll get rid of the deflationary one. Makes sense in your head, until you realize human beings just curate whatever and sometimes it makes no logical sense.
I have bitcoin. I bought it at an extremely low price. Its deflationary. I want more bitcoin than I did when I started, and I dont think thats going to change soon.

I disagree.  It wasnt the cause, but it exacerbates the problem enormously.  If it werent for the Glas Steagal repeal, most likely the losses on mortgages and mortgage backed securities would fall on smaller less risk-adverse firms specializing in sub-prime mortgages.  It would look like the Savings and Loan scandal of the late 80s and 90s.
But considering the HUD secretary then is a senior vp at JP Morgan now, I'd say regulatory capture was the single largest cause of the housing collapse outside easy credit.  Said HUD secretary also had a sweetheart sub 1% jumbo loan through the Countrywide VIP service.  Countrywide gave similar "loans" to a number of cabinet members and senators.

Soros was able to build a massive position on the pound because it was easy to acquire quietly and anonymously.
Obtaining enough bitcoin to massively corner the market is all but impossible.  He would have to acquire several million over the counter, or somehow without the market figuring it out (impossible).
Bitcoin whale wallets are known, there owners are sometimes a mystery, but large sums of bitcoin rarely move without someone knowing about it.  The same cannot be said about the pound or any other currency Soros might have shorted in the past. 
Can he do it? Sure.  He'd have to acquire and maintain hundred of small wallets over the course of a few years, moving them in and out without drawing too much suspicion.  But so could any other person and the variables of bitcoin appreciation and depreciation are vastly different and wildly out of his control.
If he's shorting bitcoin he's doing a piss poor job of it so far.  No massive spike and no massive dump.  Gradually picking away at the price of bitcoin over the course of several months is not Soros' MO.

You can buy quite a bit on the OTC market if you know where to get it, but you cant buy that much and I highly doubt any person with a few hundred thousand bitcoin would give Soros or anyone remotely associated with him the time of day given his history.
Yeah, you might make a quick $200million, but you'd be found out eventually and you'd be known as that one guy who sold his bitcoin to Soros.

Well I cant vote for Brown again as he cant run.
This legislation makes no mention of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency.  This is in regards to bail and insurance payments.  Currently there is no bondsmen or insurance company based in California that would accept bitcoin or any cryptocurrency as collateral. 
This bill takes cash out of the bail system.  Seeing as both cash and bitcoin are used by criminals to evade the law and the tax man, I dont really have a problem with it.  I dont think criminals should be paying their bail money in bitcoin.  Certain parts of society need accountability that fiat and banks provide.  Furthermore, if you are using bitcoin to pay your bail, the entire idea of an encrypted cryptocurrency flies out the door.  That bitcoin will be forever attached to you and will bring law enforcement scrutiny.  To bond company wants to deal with the IRS or the FBI.  
Furthermore, I dont want people taking out insurance with bitcoin.  This leads to the idea that someone can pull an insurance certificate on anyone with money who's origins cannot be traced.  Exactly what sort of insurance would you buy that you dont want anyone to know about?  This is really a moot point though.  No insurance company is going to take premium payments with an asset that fluctuates as much as bitcoin.  It would be a nightmare to calculate premiums.

People who think like this live in a fantasy world.  And the amount of people in my state at least mildly knowledgeable about crypto are such a tiny minority, that they will never be taken seriously as a voting block.
Bitcoin will be regulated in the states along with every other cryptocurrency.  You cannot set up an alternative system of finance in this nation without legacy financing avenues taking note.  Right now its so small its not worth dealing with to the larger banks.  But when it grows to a size that challenges existing banks, regulations on insurance and bailbonds will be the least of your concerns.  Dont kid yourselves.

ANTIFAs will never run for office, and if they did, would never be elected.  On the other hand Sessions ran pretty much unopposed for years.

No bail bondsmen or insurance company will ever waist their time doing this.  They arent in the business of forensic accounting.  They will just take wire payments from banks.

With most transactions I would agree, but these are bail bonds.  Bonds to be let out of jail pending trial.  You can argue the whole bond system needs a revamp but you need to know where that money is coming from.  Drug dealers/traffickers often have their assets frozen for a reason and bitcoin is an easy work around.
I am for most of what bitcoin stands for, but when it comes to criminal cases, I have to say its a terrible form of collateral for bail bonds.  At least with the current system you cant fully reneg on a bond.  The bondsmen will come after whatever collateral you post.  With a bitcoin collateral, anyone can pay your bond from anywhere in the world anonymously and without penalty.  Whats to stop drug traffickers in Mexico from bailing out their people in the states?  This was bound to be addressed eventually by a legislature somewhere.

You really take away personal agency.  Anyone who's spent some time in Alabama can tell you the state's population loves the guy.  The more racist the better.  And its not just the elderly.  Hate runs through multiple generations in that state and Sessions was rewarded for it.

Calling people who disagree with your views "paid trolls" doesnt enhance your argument.  It does the opposite. breaks down the bill pretty thoroughly and addresses all your concerns way better than I did and you have no retort other than to call him a troll.
Trolls dont go line by line in legislation and explain it to people.

My point is no one does this in the insurance or bail bondsmen world nor would they.  You are bitching about legislature enacting when the industry it regulates doesnt use bitcoin, has never used bitcoin and wont be using bitcoin any time in the near future.
Then you go on hyperbole like the legislature single-handedly destroys the crypto industry in the state.  It doesnt.

Is this a troll? Do you not know that dogecoin is dead tech? No ones working on it anymore.  Its on exchanges as a joke.  Its literally a meme.
And now, commercially backed e-coins arent competition for bitcoin.  They are regulated, centralized, and go against the idea of cryptocurrency.  It may have uses, but its never a true competitor.
