The government gave (um, "leased") it to market players (G Sachs, etc) with the instructions that it be used to suppress the price, trying keep the market flooded. Faith in the dollar is waning and they are desperate to keep the gold price down. So India and China bought all that gold and imported it. They want physical gold, not bullshit pieces of paper. Now the government has a bunch of IOUs that aren't worth squat. The banks could never buy it all back without sending the price through the roof.

Better off buying dope and reselling it. You'll probably make money that way, if you live.

If the worthless bums spent the time finding real work instead of begging, they'd be making some actual money. Fuck em.

I recently read an article written by a long time scammer. In the article, he says the difference between a smart person and a sucker is that the smart person reads the contract themselves and the sucker asks someone to explain the contract to them.

People (in general) are stupid and have little idea how banks work. All they care to know is how to recieve the money and how to spend it. 95% of the users are going to get on board simply because other people are doing it. Do you think a person starts using paypal and ebay because they rigorously vetted the whole system and found it acceptable? Not the majority, they started using it cause their friend Susie uses it and didn't have any problems.

These people push themselves to the margins of society and become less successful. I interact with a lot of people at other companies, email is the preferred medium. Occasionally I get the old codger who "doesn't like email" and wants to call me all the time. At this point, we either get a new representative or get a new vendor. I don't give a fuck if you like it. Use it or fuck off.

Rule 1: Never keep your coins on someone else's server or on a Windows machine. If you can't figure out how to secure your coins, you are in the wrong business.

Just like every other forum on the internet. Everybody wants personal spoon feeding instead of reading the FAQ. Right now, Bitcoin is not the place for people who can't grasp concepts from the written word and think for themselves. They will get ripped off or just lose a bunch of money trying to mine or daytrade.
