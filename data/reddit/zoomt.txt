[Quoting]( Peter Todd: "*A soft fork simply means that the block is valid under the old rules*".  From the POV of old clients, new clients are generating blocks that are valid under the old rules (the legacy blocks), so it is a softfork.
Besides, what you call it is not so important.  What is important is that the fork has all the same properties of a softfork, namely miner consensus.

Here is a more detailed description of the idea: 
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:23:38
A hardfork is fine if you have 100% consensus.  I do not see that happening anytime soon.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:16:14
Actually the changes to the code are very minimal.  The softfork version of BIP102 is not significantly more complicated than the hardfork version.
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:22:22
Yep, I think you get the idea now :)


This is not relevant.  Old nodes will also reject new blocks for other reasons too, e.g. a &gt;1MB block.
What is relevant is that old nodes will accept the *mapped* legacy blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:24:11
Neither did I.  The cat's out of the bag now :)
Although the idea can be used for evil it can also be used for good (blocksize).

The relevant check is [here](


Remember the alternative is a **hard**fork which also completely breaks old clients.  A hardfork is worse since transactions can get any number of confirmations on the old chain (in principle at least).

BIP101 pretty much hopes for exactly the same thing -- that a 75% miner majority will somehow "pressure" the remaining miners and nodes to also upgrade within two weeks.  Except there is no enforcement of this whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:54:07


Well, with a hardfork, if some users refuse to upgrade then Bitcoin will split into two incompatible versions.  I also think this is a very bad thing.
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:30:20
I have nothing against extension blocks other than it seems a bit more complicated.
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:21:27
What is important is that the legacy chain merely exists.  All it takes is a single node to broadcast the legacy chain to the old clients and miners.
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:13:52


I originally called the idea a ["generalized" softfork](  Ultimately what it is called is not so important.


@_date: 2016-01-11 10:28:58


The same is true for a hardfork -- old nodes will not see transactions confirm on the new chain.
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:07:03
Yes, the PoW hashing algorithm is unchanged -- i.e. sha256d over a block header -- so current asic hardware should be compatible.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:20:41
Right, it is a "firm" softfork (a.k.a. "generalized" softfork).
@_date: 2016-01-08 00:52:02
There is still hope.  They say this:


This is true.  It is possible to implement arbitrary blocksize increases as a "firm" [soft fork](
@_date: 2016-01-04 02:24:44


A malicious soft fork is also a "51% attack".  Firm forks are no different in that respect.
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:31:59
Not sure where it is discussed/documented, but the relevant part of  the code is [here](  Basically, any block mined by an old miner will have nVersion less than 4, which will be automatically rejected as invalid after the latest softfork (checklocktimeverify).
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:49:14
This sounds similar to [auxiliary blocks](  Such proposals did not gain much traction as it introduces extra complexity -- i.e. shuffling coins to and from the extension blocks.
In contrast BIP102-as-a-softfork aims for a straightforward blocksize increase, much like the hardfork version.  The catch is that there is no meaningful backwards compatibility for old clients.  However, the same is true if BIP102 were deployed as a hardfork.
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:08:47


This is true for all softforks, otherwise you risk generating invalid blocks under the new rules.  In fact, recent softforks were designed such that old miners are guaranteed to generate invalid blocks (by rejecting blocks with the old version number).
