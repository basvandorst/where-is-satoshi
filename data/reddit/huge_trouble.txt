What a smug ninny. 
Nerdy technical hobbyist groups are usually all-male - that's certainly been my experience from the days of BBSing in the early 80s to the early rise of the popular internet, and bitcoin is no different. Girls always seem to come later after the technology matures. 
Maybe women just don't have an inclination to weirdly esoteric technical pursuits. Why is that not OK? Why is it men's fault if women weren't participating in conversations on Bitcointalk in 2011, discussing the finer points of GPU mining?

What is your use range? Bitcoin can still be used to send money. Just not at 10,000 tps for $0.005 per transaction.
If you need to register a hash for your document, it is still possible, but maybe not for free. If you want free, there's always litecoin or its ilk, for as long as they last, or maybe Ethereum.

I share your frustration, but you have to keep in mind that this is a very large community composed of diverse political viewpoints.
There's a group of passionate anarcho-capitalists who tend to very aggressively attack any suggestion that regulation is either inevitable or necessary, even if it's just at the fiat-bitcoin interfaces. They even attack the Bitcoin Foundation, which actually helps bitcoin by acting as a lobby for the cryptocurrency industry, as being an affront to the very concept of a decentralized currency. This contingent of Bitcoin supporters are over-represented in this subreddit by their comment frequency and don't necessarily represent the majority sentiment of the community. 
On the other hand, I've see threads where more moderate voices prevail on the subject of regulation and collective industry action towards compliance. They do pop up from time to time. 
You never know who the participants are going to be in any discussion. I suppose this a problem in any large subreddit. For instance, this subreddit has been commandeered over the past few days by rubberneckers getting a schadenfreude kick over Mt. Gox's failure. Reasonable observations by oldtimers about the situation get downvoted into oblivion, while ill-informed comments get voted to the top. 
I don't know what the solution is, except to say that you've got to stay here for a while and learn to filter out the noise. Eventually you'll get a good sense of the true opportunities and challenges that face Bitcoin.

Witness the naive, uneducated, and boorish meltdown over the recent NYDFS regulatory proposal, or the the over-the-top attacks against Bitcoin developers like Mike Hearn because he's willing to suggest that there are shades other than black and white.
The people who are actually making Bitcoin succeed are disengaging from this forum due to the imbalance of opinion and because the front page increasly looks like a bunch of crazies. 
Luckily, bitcoin will succeed in spite of It's too bad, though - this place could have been great with strong moderation, but with the current mod crew, that ain't happening.

The obvious and direct way would be to acquire majority hash power and fuck with the blockchain. It could probably be done with maybe a half billion dollars or thereabouts. That ought to be enough to get a custom run of state-of-the-art 14nm energy-efficient mining chips from Intel or AMD - enough to utterly dominate mining.
There are probably cheaper ways, however. Spend tens of millions of dollars on a wide-scale whisper campaign against Bitcoin, spreading messages that it's a system that's only useful for pedophiles or terrorists. 
Or construct numerous "all of our bitcoins were stolen!!!111" situations involving what appearto be serious business operations. The negative-PR possibilities are endless.
Another obvious way is to spend tens of millions of dollars lobbying congress to implement so many regulations that using Bitcoin becomes more onerous and expensive than the existing financial system.
A huge amount of money in the hands of a motivated attacker could seriously harm Bitcoin or significantly delay its adoption.

Dan may have been wrong about his POW prediction, but the jury is still out on whether or not the NSA can dominate mining. 
The NSA could give Intel a billion dollar contract to manufacture hundreds of thousands of next-gen mining chips. Hell, they could throw twice that at it - their budget it huge. Bitcoin isn't necessarily out of the woods in that regard, which is why I cheer on the skyrocketing difficulty.

I don't think you understand. The government is going to impose laws and regulations on cryptocurrencies, full stop. Guaranteed. They know about it now, and they've heard all the bad things about it. 
The degree of that regulation depends on how effectively we engage the regulators and lawmakers to convince them that Bitcoin isn't so bad, and that it doesn't hinder law enforcement or tax collection, etc.
That's reality. Bitcoin will be legislated into the fringes unless we face that reality.

At their inception, it could be seen that TV and Email had the potential to disrupt only a few sectors of the economy. Too bad for some big businesses that were made obsolete, but otherwise not a big deal to the banks or to the government.
Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt national monetary policy and it provides a mechanism for freely exchanging value without regard to money laundering regulations. There was no way that wasn't going to attract the government's attention, and hearings like the one in NY are just the beginning unfortunately.

You'll be wanting to buy a gaming license in a gaming-friendly jurisdiction such as Antigua, Malta, or Isle of Man to name a few. Gaming licenses are quite expensive and the issuing government will want to go over your business plan with a fine-toothed comb. You'll be required to follow strict AML/KYC rules, so take that seriously.
If you elect to avoid getting a gaming license, you risk having your business detected and shut down by the authorities. You might be subjected to criminal charges and/or fines.
If that's an acceptable risk, I hear that Panama is the location of choice for risky maybe-legal ventures. You can register an anonymous corporation there and hope that somehow shields you from a criminal investigation. Panama also requires you to apply for a gaming license, so I suppose you'd be betting on lax enforcement if you ignored that.
Finally, there's always Tor, the network that enables "the dark web". You could run a hidden service on it hope that you don't accidentally cough up your real IP when your Apache server gives an internal server error. You really need to know what you're doing. Unfortunately, using Tor greatly diminishes your potential customer base.

Because the messaging has been very poor and confusing. The media is partly responsible, but so is the community. Here are some PR disasters that turn people off:
 - The idea that your computer generates bitcoin by solving complex "puzzles" doesn't make any damn sense to the average person (and it's a stupid distillation of what's actually going on), but unfortunately that's how it's presented.
 - Most people don't understand what money really is, so they're incredulous that it can be created out of thin air merely by consensus.
 - Bitcoin evangelists tend to proselytize which turns people off and makes it seem like a scam. 
 - The media has eagerly reported on the endless series of business failures, hacks, scams, and thefts, presenting them as failures of Bitcoin itself. The general public now believes that Bitcoin is that thing that gets hacked all the time. 
A good use of all this VC money would be to hire a slick PR firm to overcome these problems.

All a sidechain does is allow its ledger units to be pegged to bitcoin. This allows bitcoin users to get into the new altchain without any exchange risk. 
These arguments - that this will enable all the bitcoins to flow into a superior sidechain that's controlled by an evil organization, or that Blockstream will have undue influence of which altchains get merge mined - are extreme scenarios. Not impossible, but we don't have any reason to believe that they're at all likely. 
The core developers in Blockstream are good people, but even if they weren't, we're still dealing with open-source software, and that means that they don't have the ultimate say in who runs what.

I'm just saying that there's no way in hell that governments weren't going to try to shit all over Bitcoin. It's far too disruptive to ignore. It directly threatens monetary policy and has the potential to disrupt AML tracking, which law enforcement relies on heavily for investigations.
People are arguing that we should be making the case for no regulation, or at least keep the status quo which already provides enough regulation. I wish we could do that as well, but we can see all kinds of forces lining up demanding that Bitcoin be heavily regulated - law enforcement, banks and payment system reps, opportunistic politicians, etc. They're crying terrorism and child porn and using all the dirty tricks. It looks like a nasty fight is inevitable.
Allaire has the reputational chops to put a positive spin on Bitcoin and to steer the regulators away from effectively killing the bitcoin-fiat interfaces. His motives are selfish, but does that matter? 
There really isn't any way they can co-opt Bitcoin. Not where it matters, anyway, and that's at the protocol level. The reason is simple: any changes they introduce into the protocol will be treated as damage and will be rejected. The blockchain that follows government rules will fork and will be ignored and its value will go to zero. 
To me the main goal is to keep regulators at bay long enough to allow Bitcoin to monetize and for adoption to hit a critical mass. Once that happens, years from now, we can declare victory, because the government will find itself on the outside looking in to a multi-trillion dollar distributed global economy.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:53:28
I think that's a mischaracterization of the issue. Nobody wants regulation, but it's pretty obvious that regulation is coming regardless of what we want because Bitcoin is far too threatening to be left alone. 
What is desired therefore is a seat at the table to at least keep the regulators from outright killing Bitcoin. The recent regulatory hearings in New York appear to have been a success in that regard. 
Clarity on regulation is also desired so that businesses can make plans without running into surprise roadblocks.

Trust me, I'm hardly an "enslavement-loving statist." If you want to get taken seriously, try cutting down on the hyperbole a little.
Personally, I'd rather have my bitcoins worth thousands per bitcoin rather than $1/bitcoin. Because that's what they'll be worth unless we throw the government a bone. 
All that means is that we convince them that Bitcoin can be regulated through the fiat &lt;=&gt; btc exchange points. You and I know that the protocol itself allows us to freely use our bitcoins and way we wish.
There'll come a day when the bitcoin economy is large enough and self-contained enough that we'll no longer need to exchange for fiat, and that's when governments lose this game.
But we can't attack the government when we're weak, guns ablazing, because they have many many ways to drive Bitcoin underground. The Bitcoin Foundation serves to put a smiley face on Bitcoin and I believe it will help us win in the long run.

Watch passively as lobbyists and legislators pass regulations that make bitcoin too cumbersome for regular businesses to deal with. Watch bitcoin struggle as an underground currency with low liquidity and the risk of going to jail if anyone tries to do anything substantial with it.
B) Accept that regulation will happen with or without us, create an organzation to put a friendly face on Bitcoin, and take a seat at the regulatory table. Bitcoin survives an outright banning and eventually becomes indispensible after many years.

There are a large number of anarcho-capitalist  Bitcoiners who think engaging with the government over regulatory issues is the same as being a grovelling supplicant, begging for the right to lick the government's boot (paraphrasing here).
Under this view of things, we should let the government attack Bitcoin, because the system can take it and it will survive. The most important thing is having a free-market currency, even if it's worth $0.01. Which of course exposes it to a cheap 51% attack, but nevermind that.

All these altcoins that offer 100% anonymity out of the box will be explicitly banned by governments. Bitcoin will be lucky if it manages to avoid the ban hammer, and that's with pseudonymity.
The most practical approach for advocates of privacy is to develop and support privacy enchancements to Bitcoin, such as mixers, Darkwallet, or Zerocoin (which can be impemented on top of Bitcoin without mining according to Peter Todd). 
That makes Bitcoin much easier to sell to the legislators, because you can describe the anonymity features as mere add-ons instead of a core feature of the protocol.

Governments can tax bitcoin transactions just as they do with cash, using the threat of random audits and jail time to keep people in line. 
Bitcoin might make online crime more desirable for criminals than real-world violent crime, but I don't see how that affects the viability of the nation state in any way. It can and will employ violence as it requires to maintain its interests.
Ultimately, nation states will smother Bitcoin in its crib if does actually start to diminish their power. It's easy to do - just outlaw digital currencies that aren't sanctioned by the state. The price of bitcoin will go to pennies, and liquidity will evaporate.
So no, Bitcoin will not end the nation state. It will not even lightly damage the nation state. What it can do is provide a little more economic freedom to the world, but that's only if we're careful to work with policy makers to ensure that it doesn't get legislated into oblivion. Going around and declaring that "Bitcoin will end the nation state" can only hurt Bitcoin.

The limit matters though, because it affects the magnitude of an attack that can be performed by a malicious miner (or other attackers), such as stuffing blocks full in order to cause processing delays for other miners. Larger blocks mean larger delays, giving the attacker that much more of a head start on the next block.

Well, imagine an even stronger form of the BitLicense, but for AnonymousCoin, and applied everywhere.

This severely limits its liquidity, and thus its utility, making it unattractive even for most underground users. 
And that's the gentle way. The other way is to simply outlaw it and see if that survives a supreme court challenge. There are all sorts of ways that governments can ensure that cryptocurrency never flourishes in the open.

Bitcoin can be anonymous. For example, the MyBitcoin thieves haven't been caught yet, despite a pretty intensive effort to find them. Same for the Bitstamp thieves.
Besides, I think Bitcoin's pseudonymity is what protects it from being banned outright. The argument that the Bitcoin blockchain is actually a benefit to law enforcement due to the ease with which transactions can be traced actually has traction with policy makers. 
I think that strongly-anonymous coins will eventually face even more onerous regulation than Bitcoin, relegating them to small market caps and limited utility.

Larger blocks would push out small miners and node operators due to high bandwidth costs. Running a bitcoin node would then be left to people with cheap data plans or those who are willing to spend extra money on a dedicated node on a VPS or in a data center. 
Also, there's the issue of block transmission times. As blocks grow in size, they take longer to propagate. If you're a miner (or a mining pool), and your block takes a few milliseconds longer to transmit to the network than your competitor, you lose money. So you're highly motivated to locate in a data center with good Internet access. 
As blocks grow ever larger, it starts to make sense to locate as close as possible to other miners to ensure that you're getting your blocks propagated to them as fast as possible (colocation). Cartels and mergers then become inevitable. Then eventually one or two big players remain, and Bitcoin ends up becoming PayPal. It's a pessimistic scenario, but it's plausible.

I'm saying that it's a necessary expedient given the dangerous territory Bitcoin is treading upon. Bitcoin is probably tolerated (and just barely) because the argument that it's traceable enough for law enforcement seems to have some traction.

No, this sucks. We had the same fucking conversation yesterday. And 100 times before that. 
Some newb comes in and and says "Hey guys! Listen to my genius new arguments against bitcoin!" and we're supposed to take it seriously? Screw that.
To all newcomers: please use the search box. Hell, use google. There are hundreds and hundreds of articles going back to 2009 that cover these objections.
