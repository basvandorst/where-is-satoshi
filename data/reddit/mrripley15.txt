It's consolidating while volume fades, get ready for a break and a possible fake-out.

Sorry for the noob question, but does that mean if I wanted to buy bitcoin between now and January, that I shouldn't use CB as an exchange?

And by crook you mean wall street?

If you're using future events to determine current valuation, time is definitely a factor. Not sure why you're ignoring that part of my discussion. You can see this best when comparing stock price to option valuation. Options often have expected earnings price moves baked-in to the price, which can make Iron Condors a good play, etc.
Also, not sure on your definition of arbitrage...

I don't know why you would think the next halving, which is two years away, is baked into the price.

You don't trade just the company/fundamentals, you also trade the perception. Has perception changed on crypto to the point where nobody wants to buy it? No. Are people looking for investment alternatives? Yes.
So honestly, tell me, why is it that you "can't see it going back up to what it was"?

Miners are selling their cards because the price of bitcoin is low compared to the cost of mining, so it's not as profitable to mine, NOT because they're "getting fed up".

By that logic, you could argue the next halving in 2024 is also baked into the price, and the one after that, and the one after that. It's estimated in 2036 99% of the bitcoins will be mined. Is that also baked into the price? Why or why not?
There's probably some algorithm and terminology to explain this, but in my experience time period to said future event/move plays a factor in valuation. I could see if maybe the next halving was six months away, maybe even up to a year but that's pushing it, IMO.

Yes, true we know these things are going to happen, but you say "we take it into account". That's a very human thing to do "taking it into account" with very different human reactions that follow. I know people that don't take the next month into account when making financial decisions. How can you possibly assume an event two years out is taken into account ENOUGH, that the price will not rise dramatically as we get closer to that date?

Your word salad is full of nonsense and you don't understand trend lines.
