Yeah this website is really neat and lets you know when your 1-2 sat/byte transaction will get confirmed. 
@_date: 2019-04-29 02:36:39
Makes me so happy.

True. I miss my 184 satoshi fee transactions tho.  =/  
Yooooo, those guys need to fuck off the network. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:10:30
Are we still not ready for a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:07:30
Can bitcoin hit 100k+ already so the fees in lightning network are actually worth it? Right now they're about equivalent to segwit 2sats/vbyte. Super impatient. =/

I say, you should figure out your tax liability not through the IRS  but through the statues and laws passed. USC or CFR. the IRS will litterally tell you to pay up. so yeah. do your own research.   
Good luck.

Depends how far you want to go with bitcoin. Think its going to be the world reserve currency? Run a full node and setup an "electrum-personal-server" to go with your model T. Or a hardware wallet and a good PC or laptop should be good enough. Might want to look into lightning app on your phone for when merchants adopt that network and maybe a "hot wallet" as well for p2p transactions.
So tldr:
1. hardware wallet
2. cryptosteel or the equivalent
3. safe for seeds
4. PC/laptop to run a bitcoin full node/electrum-personal-server/electrum
5. smartphone with a "hot wallet" and lightning app(breez, elcair, ect..)
good luck.

UNITED STATES is a corporation and they operate for profit so this doesnt surprise me much.

1. Are you assuming bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency with value or that is accepted by merchants?What about stocks from companies?  or other finite supply cryptocurrencies?(They will most likely be digitized in the form of a token either on their own blockchain/a token on neo/icx/eth/etc...)
2. I think its a better perspective to look at society from, what has value and what can be exchanged rather than bitcoin this and bitcoin that. Bitcoin will be Bitcoin and people will adopt its' features or they will not use it.
3. see point 1 about stocks and anything else that holds value (land, ownership of vehicles or assetss, ect...)
4. A. i dont know what kind of elite's youre particularly talking about but the ones im aware of, take things of value that are property in nature. so that includes labor, life, rights. its not just "them" hodl'ing. they will hold you down and enslave you in many different ways(particularly talking about the U.S government).
4.B youre assuming value against... USD EUR YEN ect ect? Id probably look at gold price and how much Bitcoin itll take for you to buy cars, boats, houses, land instead of just the government fiat redemption rate. Youre trying to get away from fiat right? or just trying to make profit? either way youre going to have to be specific with what your short and long term goals and effects of holding BTC or other cryptocurrencies.

I mean with bitcoin anyone can contribute to making it better. Google you have to be one of them to even see the inner working or source code for google. Its a little different.
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:08:31
I dont know. ask society in about 100 years and compare our time with theirs. (if you live that long)  
So for right now its just... kinda irrelevant to us. cool to think about but yeah. very hard to predict.

putting federal reserve notes in a bank is giving a bank an unsecured loan. just saying.
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:09:58
gotta try it out or read reviews. I think its similar to Nicehash but caters towards newbies more.   
If youre going to use their services, use them for your benefit and limit your risk.
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:45:07
Bitcoin = Gold = actual value.
Federal reserver note = USD = debt instrument.   
Of course it is better. ='\]

"Sec. 201. Any amount of income tax (including interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts) for any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1938, to the extent attributable to compensation for personal service as an officer or employee of a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing." only applies to participants in the state payroll? 
I mean on your w4 you can put exempt from federal withholdings. So I dont see why you'd have to fight the IRS every single year with trying to get your withholdings refunded.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:20:45
Working at macdonalds or fredmeyers or retail, is not taxable income. If you have nothing to do with the federal or state governments and the money exchanged to you for your labor is not directly connected to them, you dont owe federal or state taxes. federal and state income taxes are excise taxes and only privileged activities are taxed. working at some private company and being paid by them is not taxable. There has not been a direct tax in history that passed with consensus. Federal income tax was put to limit the abuse that individuals could take money from the government or from public lands or resources  in exchange of labor or services.

A smaller blocksize enables more users to run their own node for validation or w/e due to bandwidth. the fiat system we have now, in 99% of countries, is literally taxed without representation by printing more fiat. savers get taxed. fiat becomes a terrible means of exchange. ect. bitcoin has a predictable emission of newly minted coins that is made public. the price of btc is rising despite the massive amount of inflation. bitcoin will replace fiat when lightning network becomes larger and mobile devices are integrated or some sort of card with a chip containing bitcoin or LN funds can be used at any retail outlet.
Everything else you mention in your post are just if's based on your current perspective of bitcoin and its price behavior. as in they could happen or they could not.   
merchants in the future should be able to just use LN without being forced to use the blockchain. employees can be payed via LN and expenses could also be paid using LN. everything else I left out could be substituted by your imagination of whats possible.  
When someone sells, someone buys. or the price tanks BUT if retail investors actually enter the market let alone start using LN. There is going to be alot of value coming into the market. the price volatility will be significantly lower. one merchant dumping wont affect the price much or at all.  
I think your If on the blocksize and multi-chain LN stuff will just be a wait and see sorta thing. If internet providers raise the bandwidth cap and speeds, then the blocksize will matter less to a higher size. so right now people bitch about the 2mb blocksize but if the world had 1gbps internet speeds and 1 terrabyte bandwidth i dont think 2mb limit would stick around much longer.  
hope this shines a different perspective on ya.

Yep, I read into the tax code and losthorizons and did my research. Federal income tax is for federal income or income derived from gains or profits of public land. State income tax is just about the same. for state employees or employees on a state payroll. All private payrolls are not considered wages and do not need to be reported on a w2 or to the irs. It is law. 
Have good day.

If it drops to 2500$, buy. If it drops to 2000$, buy. If it drops to 1500$, buy. If it drops to 1000$, buy. Just like how you'd FOMO in when the 10% daily gains show up. (Not financial advice) ='\]

What else are you going to do with that 200 euros?
What do I want out of buying bitcoin?
What is bitcoin to me?Why am I interested in bitcoin?
What else can bitcoin do?
What will I do when bitcoin goes to 1 euro?
Its all about perspective.

Higher price in Venezuela is due to the demand being higher than the rest of the world, combined with not being able to flood Venezuela with more BTC from outside the country.

section 86 refers to salaries. everyone? so with the federal income tax of all income that was derived from the united states or agency thereof as well as all salaries(civil, military,federal). those are who pay federal income tax? ya

When BTC is 1 million dollars I am sure people will be buying lambos and coffee with it. When? I have no idea. ='\]
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:18:08
1. Market cycle, A combination of 1000 different events. 
2. Crypto market is alot smaller in terms of people so volume fluctuates alot more. When 1 billion dollars enters the market pumps and when someone rich decides to sell, the market dumps. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and so is the rest of the market.
3. Best guess I can give is, its going somewhere. maybe to 10k or 0.01 cents. The predictions I've heard of for the price of BTC in the future is 330K, 1 Million, 16$. really everyone is just shouting numbers. ='\]
As an elderly person, I would think of having a way to pass the BTC you would have rights to, onto next of kin or significant other. Not financial advice. =\] Be well.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:29:08
oh boy the possibilities.  I dont think miners will be negatively affected. LN will draw more people to bitcoin, so ultimately more people will use on-chain and LN maybe not together but as a whole more people will be using bitcoin in some way. and in the future hopefully internet providers give us that terabyte bandwidth cap so we dont have to worry about blocksize and ect ect ect.

I think this is a good 4.5x from the top BUT i also have some feelings reserved for a 2-3k Bitcoin. Dont let yourself be blinded. the support at 6k is a good example.
