I didn't write the article. But I am the commenter recommending daily withdraws. But to be quite honest, I am only vaguely familiar with bitcoins and the process.

Nice, I just checked BIPS out, they do have a Prestashop integration. Thanks for the info, you are the rare helpful redditor. 
Edit: About the seed sellers, they are marijuana, but they are all based in the Netherlands too. So it is legal for them, they are just branching out to ship more to the US.

Could you link me to some of the credible ones? I am an e-commerce developer that hasn't has anyone ask about accepting bitcoin yet, but that would be something valuable to know about. I imagine someone will ask about it eventually, especially since a few of my clients are high profile seed sellers.

I wasn't trying to start an argument, it was a legitimate question. 
For your point about computers slowing down with age, I think everyone has noticed that. But at the same time, software grows also. Compare what windows xp started out with loaded vs what windows xp retired with loaded. The last version takes more memory and loads more processes. 
See this part is what I was wondering about. I am a web developer, so I have been exposed to bitcoins, I know the theory behind them, but nothing more really. I have see threads about people that mine them, but I have no first hand experience. 
But let me ask, because I googled the shit out of it an couldn't find an answer. Do you think that graphic card companies test the cards before they ship them? And how long / how much of a test do you think they do? 
See what I was imagining was say nvidia, I would guess that they (just a guess I have no freaking clue) produce like 10k cards a day. I bet they have some big machine that they load batches of the cards in and test them to make sure they are not doa. I was just thinking instead of doing what processes they normally do to test, they could mine bit coins instead. What I had pictured in my mind was like a machine that say holds 500 cards, it gets loaded mines for like 1 hr, then unloads and a new batch is put in. Not running the cards all day or anything. But it would seem like they test them anyways, so why not off set it by making a little money. Which each slot change, I am sure they have to redesign a new machine, so next slot change do one that mines coins. It was just a thought and I was wondering what the pro's / cons of it would be.

I certainly would not buy a car that has never been started before.

Any company could use another revenue stream. I bet it could be handled in a manner that would make it worth while, at least from my limited research.

Yeah, I guess the main reason is that a car breaks down over time and the engine wears. I have never seen anything that says over time processors get slower or anything like that. If you have some kind of study that says shows how the same graphics card's performance deteriorates over time, I would love to read it.
