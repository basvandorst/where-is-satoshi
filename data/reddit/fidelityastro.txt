Lol why that's almost 2% of Donald Trump's net worth!
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:28:15
LOL yeah because a community that happily assists in money laundering is just what Bitcoin needs 
@_date: 2015-12-14 11:02:31
Lol check out this dumbass. Have you already tried googling "how to launder money"?
@_date: 2014-07-14 21:57:14
Uh isn't pretty much the first rule of investing that history doesn't predict future performance?
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:50:43
HOLY SHIT IS THAT A FLAG

I used to listen to it quite a bit, so not so obvious I guess.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:45:00
Yes but given how thrilling I'm sure it was I can't help but wish he'd also ask for additional forms of currency. Imagine how thrilling it would be of he also asked for gold bullion!
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:13:04
Yeah or dogecoin
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:25:38
Probably dogecoin
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:36:34
Sure but ultimately they're not going to be accepting bitcoins: they're going to be taking dollars that have been converted from bitcoins by a payment processing company. Seems a bit silly to be singing bitcoin's praises in that context.

He should make payal a part of the show too; that would be so awesome to listen to
@_date: 2014-07-14 21:55:20
Why would it have rejected it if it was to collect data?

How would jets function in a vacuum? How can one peer from behind eyes; doesn't one need eyes to peer?
This fucking subreddit, man. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:53:55
As a long term investment? Um, yes, obviously. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 10:34:35
lol "everyone"
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:20:53
Uh I don't think anyone would classify the forex market as anything but speculative. Of course Bitcoin is too. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:35:05
Yeah you should either buy no lottery tickets or invest all of your money in lottery tickets. It's common sense. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 22:43:37
led, not lead
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:10:46
So until the end of time. Got it.

98.6% positive would be considered a bad feedback rating on eBay. . .

Enh, at least lotto has a guaranteed payout. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 12:23:17
Just FYI that works out to $1,000 a year, which you could be spending in a really nice experience. Spending $20/week on lottery tickets, in Bitcoin form or paper, is a really really bad idea.

A consensus emerges that Bitcoin isn't being used for anything other than a low number of black market purchases and the value has been driven up by investors. Investors realise there not going to be able to get anything for their bitcoins and have no useful way of getting rid of it. Value drops to zero along with demand. This is the most likely outcome.
Other than optimistic investors driving the price up there's been no meaningful adoption of bitcoin by merchants. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:53:56
He doesn't. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 20:52:20
Um, a fork isn't Bitcoin so maybe you should post this in some other sub. WE ONLY TALK ABOUT BITCOIN HERE
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:48:45
It's pretty funny that somebody downvoted this.
