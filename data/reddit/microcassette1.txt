Ofc anyone in this sub gonna say yes, it's a bitcoin sub. 
But you need to get your head in the game. Either you're in or your out. There is nothing in between and don't let emotions get the best of you.

Supply and demand, and maybe they want in before CME and TD starts trading on the big stock exchanges.

It's all about trends, when people buy for number of reasons, news, rumors etc.  it goes up. And people see it moving up people jump on the train of fear of missing out and causes it to spike. 
When people realize they got a profit they sell at the tops and causes it to drop because the sales are more then the buy orders. 
To penetrate that new ath it needs to go through that big sale wall with buy orders. If the buy orders can't penetrate the sales order it will remain at the same level.

"Not your private keys, not your bitcoins "
- andreas antonopoulos
Its like Mt gox, bitifinex ( 30 millions dollars) and other exchanges that got hacked and there money stolen.
Should have kept them offline in a paper wallet with your own keys then it would never have happend. 
It's sad people don't learn from history, and letting it repeat itself.

You are in a bitcoin sub, ofc everyone is gonna say invest. But you should read about the technology/ how it's built and make up your mind yourself if it's here to stay or not.

Lol, just ordinary rise as the days before. 
Nothing special.

I dont get the this " you're rich give me money thing".  You if anyone should know how your family works. 
If you think they give it all back to you, I would do it happily. But I doesn't seem
that way for u. That's something to think about.

Hahah, amen! 
I think he wants to know the value of one bitcoin in fiat? Sorry but not every wallet has that function. 
Try looking at an exchange for example and you see the current value of 1 bitcoin.

Agree you should really read about it instead of asking. There is so much to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:47:15
Wait 2-3 hours and we'll see! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:15:20
They use " bits" but you can change that in the settings.

Bitcoin will take a hit and dip in value and rise again like other forks!
