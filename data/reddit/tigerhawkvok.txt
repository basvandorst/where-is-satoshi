Sure, I'm skeptical but what's the harm
It'll let my partner and I buy the house we're waffling over!

I'm sorry for your monetary losses. However, seeing as 43 BTC pre crash exceeds my total assets, I'm honestly not as sorry as I should be.

Damn. I have a hard time saving up to a single Bitcoin as, well, one of my main saving and investment mechanisms. (And for diversity, stock too, but only about a half btc equiv there).
The idea of 100 btc.... Mind boggling. I'm still at a point where a swing of 1btc is a good chunk of my flexible assets.

Late, but thanks much man :-)

Or ... Don't use an online wallet. Honestly, I'm sure that the only reason this hasn't happened with banks yet is the byzantine transfer process.

You're incorrect. Try, for example, sharing a file in dropbox. If you enter an email address, it'll auto-complete to the full name of the user if they have an account.

1) You shouldn't be storing money on anything but a local machine.
2) Even so, so what? Delete your name from the server if you care. It's not like they have access to your money, just your name - email link. They can get that from Facebook.
3) And if they determine that you probably have bitcoin, so what? You are already protected by your password and really should have two factor authentication on. 
The only way this is an issue at all is if you (a) keep money on an online wallet (b) have a weak password (c) no two factor authentication and (d) have not mentioned anywhere else associated with this email the word "bitcoin", so they couldn't use facebook/google/whatever as a launching point either.

Neither, "Bitcoin Wallet".

Super generous man!

Don't suppose there's a way to attach an edu to an existing account, huh?
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:21:15
I'm assuming he meant 8 characters, but it's still a far cry from secure. You really should use at least 16 characters where possible.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:23:01
An 8 bit password is not secure at all, sadly.

Well, if Trump wins it'll go toward getting me drunk and forgetting for an evening....

There we go. aes256 encrypted, and that let me decode my strings.
Thanks much! I'll update the parent post for future people.
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:46:20
Err, I lied, base64-encoded.
Hm, I didn't think I ever installed anything other than bitcoin core on my desktop ....

o_0 jeeze, I don't think I've ever seen even a tenth of that in cash before, let alone owned it.
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:46:18
In cash? No.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:11:55
Damn. That's generous. I can't imagine I'd have been one of the lucky few if I was on this reddit thread last night, but props man. That's mind-bogglingly awesome.
Probably totally superfluous for you, but have some gold, because damn.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:04:08
Yeah, the sad part is I saw it all coming when I was massively in debt, so I couldn't invest. I'm climbing out of the hole, but even post-crash $100+/BTC is too pricey for me to really invest seriously.
