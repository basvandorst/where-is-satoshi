Avalon is impossible to get ahold of by design (Don't reply to emails, don't pick up the phone, don't log onto or post on any forums) any time something important is going down with their miners
Not that I blame them but it is an absolute fucking nightmare
There's one group buy of chips which is turning out to look like a scam but nobody can get ahold of Avalon to change the address
JohnK had provided Escrow, but the Escow is 100% pointless if we can't get ahold of Avalon to change the shipping address
**Is there ANY WAY ON EARTH to get ahold of Avalon?  There's 80,000$ worth of chips on the line**
It might turn out that ragingazn628 is telling the truth, but it's always better to assume that people aren't in this community

yeah, that doesn't fucking work.  they ask you basic shit (DOB, last 4 digits of SSN, name, address) and then say "welp sorry it didn't work go fuck yourself try again in 24 hours"

I didn't answer incorrectly.
It's literally broken
This is an objective fact, i don't give a shit about you
It's SUPPOSED to ask you other questions, but it simply DOES NOT for some people.
And i did not answer incorrectly.  It's literally only asking my simple things, not a single personal ID question at all.

The thing is, the absolute lack of ANY personal questions.. just the simple, i'm assuming everyone has questions like 'name, DoB, SSN numbers' and NOT specifics like 'what street did you grow up on', etc, etc.  makes me think that info is just missing, from whatever "credit reports" they have or are supposed to have.
Everything else on their website is checked out, validated, etc.
