They're clearly stamped with purity and weight of gold (not the total weight, the weight of the gold only). [They often come in a little sleeve with certification and tracking/verification information]( 
I did mention you need to find someone who can actually identify gold, people who know nothing about it just plain won't accept it. 
But, among those who do, they'll know what you have and what it's worth, especially with the common stuff. Everyone that knows gold knows about 1/10oz Gold Eagles, and PAMP Suisse gram bars.

Independent contractors are the **most likely** to accept gold in my experience, and the most likely to barter in general.

It's kind of silly to say it's impossible to pay with gold.
Tons of places accept gold, especially when it's a coin/note instead of a bar, but you need to find someone that actually knows how to identify gold. Their concern is someone paying with worthless gold-plated metal, EX: [Gold Trump Coins]( worth about $1, but would be $1,500 if actual gold. 
Some states have gone so far as to [recognize gold as legal tender]( NY obviously isn't one of those. (However, technically, no private entity can be compelled to accept legal tender, so businesses can refuse, just like they can refuse to be paid in pennies.)
Of course Subway isn't taking a $4,200 bar on a $6 sale, but, your local jeweler/pawn shop/flea market is happy to take bullion towards a Rolex. Your local gunsmith will take gold for guns. Your local plumber will probably take bullion over cash. Damn near anyone you barter with is open to gold.

Gold trades around $45/gram right now.
Gram and tenth-gram notes/bars/coins are available, and far more reasonable for day-to-day purchases than a $4000+ brick.

GPU's are only part of the equation. 
30 GPU's will draw ~6,000w from the wall. Moral is, that's well past what you can just plug in and run. You need to consider dedicated circuits or electrical hookups.

It was never a stable unit of value, it's one of the most volatile by any measure.
BTC was under $3500 in Feb and near $12,000 in June, a 350% swing in just a few months, and since it's subject to it's own unique set of market forces, it's almost impossible to predict. 
Those changes have nothing to do with the worth of a bitcoin, acceptance, production, etc. It's basically just a measure of hype at the moment. 
On top of that, the market is still small enough that single players can move the entire market on their own. EX: Remember when BitMex [dropped the price by 9%, over $1000/coin, in 30 minutes]( resulting in the value dropping another $1000/coin over the next month for no other reason than other investors figuring it's time to get out too? Then the panic ended and it corrected back.

If someone told me they could have sold out at $13k 3 months ago, but chose to hold on and sell at $8k today, I'd say they're being an idiot.

Well, that's one way to avoid admitting how much money you lost.
Sure bud, I'll come find you in 3 years and check the report card.

December might have doubled, but you missed the chance to triple it, and your summer paychecks are now worth half as much. 
If you took the past 12 months pay in BTC and cashed out today, you'd be losing money.
Compared to taking pay in "state confetti" and throwing it in an index fund, you lost even more, index funds returned like 30% last year...
@_date: 2019-12-20 21:52:05
Investing is all about the percentage return. If you can get a higher return anywhere else, you're invested in the wrong place.
I know your return was under 30%, so, how many more thousands of dollars would you have made just parking it in an index?

Yea, the article is pretty clear they were busted because Border Force intercepted packages of drugs.
The source article makes it even clearer, confirming they were addressed to the arrested parties. It was only after they made the bust that they discovered they were bought on the dark web using bitcoin.

At least in my area, 27,000 is like a month of sales at a popular bar. Might seem insane, but a shocking amount of people flow through bars and get a few drinks.

Local solar companies will install panels on your home and basically sell the power back to you at a discount, while selling all the excess back to the grid at retail.
If you use more than you generate, you still pay the same discounted rate.
Turns out, running miners on half-priced electricity is far more profitable than letting someone else re-sell it.

You're claiming they're withholding literally millions of dollars in your funds, but won't hire a lawyer or get law enforcement involved, after they literally told you to do so and explained how to?
Man, it really looks like you're doing something shady and trying to strong-arm them into ignoring it.
