The real china sell-off hasn't even begun, 80 percent of all bitcoin hold by china. The price will crash to 100 dollar in 2 weeks, 20 dollar this summer MAX. All governments will ban bitcoin before this summer.

1 dollar each seems more realistic.

20 dollar this summer 'nothing has changed but the price'
These ridiculous prices can't hold, i think 1 dollar per bitcoin is a  fair price.

75 dollars, well lets say 100 dollars. 
Q2 2014 : 20 dollars... professor bitcorn was right.

It's more likely on the verge of collapse.  The pyramid collapsed, below 20 dollars this summer.

Banks should ban all bitcoin related transactions, they must protect their customers for this dangerous cloud castle.

A bitcoin company which turns out to be a scam, that's pleonasm.

This is how a real ponzi looks, a coordinated small majority buying extravagant sports cars, yachts and houses. The majority went bankrupt by buying bitcoin.

That's quite optimistic.
