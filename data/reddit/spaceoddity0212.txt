Thank you so much! I read a lot of articles regarding bitcoins, but this seems more practical and useful.

The stall uses the Luno wallet which has different fees for different methods.  [here is the list](

It's a hardware wallet like ledger and trezor

And also try to move your BTC to a hardware wallet as the reliability of luno wallet is questionable. I recently bought a ledger nano s from tianche research.

@_date: 2017-09-30 19:09:07
Sure, it is in 185 Kampung Pauh, 15350 Kota Bharu
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:00:08
Memang boleh

I think it is more educational than profitable, the stall is educating the Malaysians about cryptocurrency which a lot of Malaysians are still not familiar with. Most of their customers still use cash hahaha

I personally do recommend you to move to cold wallets. I myself am using the ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:00:01
I am also a luno user, I recommend you to send bitcoin to a phone number so that you can avoid the fee. 
EDIT: I mean to your receiver's phone number if he/she is your friend
