BTC plz!
I can only get so hard
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:06:14
A meth pipe?
@_date: 2014-10-10 08:21:45
I apologise for my ignorance, but could you describe what RDK 3000 is?
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:32:25
But nonetheless! Thanks for the thread!

So theoretically you could hook up an armory offline wallet (or something similar) rather than using the mytrezor service?
@_date: 2014-07-26 08:19:10
You should edit a datestamp onto it so we can tell if it could be still relevant for future versions that will no doubt eventually be released.
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:26:24
500 ubits Thanks for doing that for that person :)
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:00:41
Back in my day bits were fancy 1's and 0's! None of this riff raff and cryptowhosamawhatsits!
Git off ma lawn you youngins!

Could you not see the video?
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:18:45
Touche op.
Well played. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 02:28:58
Its also a good idea to route it to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 as some people may have local web services running on their localhost
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:16:43
It's only illegal if you get caught ;)
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:30:35
Silly question, but why exactly 11nm? Why not 12 or 10?
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:04:14
The future is amazing! :'D
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:53:27
Could you define 10.000 further?
Sorry I just don't understand the reference
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:13:31
The blood of the innocent?
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:22:53
I see, American only?
In NZ we have services in America for forward shipping to NZ. I may just do this.

Is antminer worth looking into in terms of block eruptors? I have been considering these for a small hobby of generating BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-24 06:04:13
Could you please post the links to the articles?
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:59:58
Delusions of grandeur really. We are far from $10,000. This isn't a get rich quick scheme
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:36:04
Awesome! Thanks for the informative reply
I agree with the excitement. What a time to be alive!
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:45:58
Is there any news of Storj at the expo? I'm excitedly looking forward to a release so I can get on board.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:18:55
In addition, I use a similar app for my Android device, it's called [Twilight](
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:16:44
Do you personally believe this person that you know is the real Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-01-01 09:05:30
I am proud to be a part of the Bitcoin revolution. Lets take this currency into the future!

I have been considering running a full node for a while now. I just have a few concerns.
No doubt opening my port and running a full node is asking for trouble I totally understand that part.
If I were to get an old windows xp box or something similar and run a clean instance of the core client (one that has never touched actual BTC) what would be the worst that would potentially happen? Could a hacker access my network and connect to other devices not running the core client?
Also as stated above, I would not be running the client I use with my BTC on the xp box. If the 8333 port is forwarded to the xp box my other client would not be able to connect is that correct?
My primary concern is this; would someone be able to access the client that contains my BTC if I run a full node on a different machine?
Thanks for your time.

Do you ship to New Zealand? This will be my deciding factor for this awesome deal
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:25:22
Thanks for the reply. Please, for the good of the bitcoin community make sure that you and Satoshi stay safe.
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:40:41
No problem my friend.
Tip it forward! It means much more to share the love
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:56:34
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:14:07
Might as well put those greenbacks to good use ;)
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:30:48
Forgive me if this is incorrect, but doesnt the mytrezor step still mean that we have a dependency for an online wallet service? I thought Trezor was meant to be the equivalent of an offline hardware based wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-27 03:43:55
No, it's about 0.0745 btc iirc. Maybe 0.00745 actually. I can't quite remember how much the chips were worth.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:19:10
Holy fuck you're generous!
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:19:54
Still going around?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:21:15
Could you explain for a non American?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:02:39
Fellow Kiwi here.
Check out  It is the main Bitcoin exchange in NZ.
There is a new exchange that has recently opened. It is tua.co.nz I believe.
Also check out @_date: 2013-12-22 09:17:52
I hope you know that your URL read to me as bit foreplay.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:40:58
Bitcoin is depressing.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:12:29
Good to see other kiwis getting involved with the bit community! There aren't enough of us!
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:08:57
Also subbed. It should be good to watch these subreddits grow!
Good idea T-Rex. Now I just need to think of a service to provide!
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:17:17
I choose to follow the rule of never investing more than I am willing to lose.
If bitcoin does tank its not the end of the world. At the end of the day I have learnt more then I ever expected to from this currency and I am grateful for that. I'm happy just being a part of the revolution.
I do agree with the OP but as a financial noob I cant comment further.

You think you've got it good? Check out 
It's currently at $690 NZD and sure to rise when the rest of New Zealand wakes up!
