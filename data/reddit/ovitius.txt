We both agree on BTC being bad for crime. We specifically target privacy coins and other coins with built-in tumbling features that are preferred methods. Tumblers work very well when the third party service provider is reliable.
ICO laundering actually does make sense, when there is minimal oversight. This is why we made it explicitly clear that this scheme is less likely to work in north america or in countries where there is a strict ICO and AML oversight. Only large scale operations do it, otherwise it is not worth the hassle.

Because it is still easier no matter how much the bank adheres to it.

A little clarification for you all.
This man was the mastermind behind BTCP, a shitcoin that resulted from the pump and dump of ZCL.
An inside member of the team, which i won't be naming, basically leaked that the 3 million dollar donation pool essentially disappeared long before the fork was done. He also leaked the fact that Rhett, and the entire BTCP team all dumped their ZCL on the ATH in january, and they acquired it for pennies on the dollar one week before announcing the fork in december. This was your classical pump and dump and insider trading scheme. After this scheme was done, Rhett cashed out most of his assets and moved to Puerto Rico. He made millions off his insider trading, but it was time to distribute the donation pool money and other illicit profits, and this is where things hit a wall.
1) They pumped and dumped ZCL with the BTCP fork news and made millions.
2) They asked for millions from the community for "exchange listings" and the 3 million dollars they raised has disappeared, no audits were ever conducted.
3) When BTCP got listed, the team started unloading everything they got on the investors and made even more millions through the foundation pool.
Once the fork was launched, it was time to distribute the scam profits between the team and Rhett got into a massive disagreement with the rest of the team. From there, they kicked him out and he started exposing the true nature of the project and started pretending that he had nothing to do with this scam other than just contributing to the code.
He is a massive fraud, and i am not afraid of calling him out on it. When i confronted him with evidence, all he did was blocking me.

Read the Bitcoin tumbling part. It doesn't matter if it's a blockchain, it's easy to hide and launder dirty money using cryptocurrencies.
The ICO money laundering process takes place when the insiders who own the company pump their own dirty cash into it, and then cash it out again under another entity, which makes it impossible to connect the dirty money to them.
Also, using coins like Monero, who have ringCT and stealth addresses coded in, makes the process of conversion laundering much easier because it erases the trail of the money, no matter how "decentralized" the coin can be.

So....What does this have to do with anything ? That is your argument ? Personal attacks ?
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:43:56
Yes, play stupid games, get stupid rewards.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:20:20
If you bothered to read the text you'd know we mentioned many approaches to money laundering, not just large transfers, but almost small increments to avoid detection. This is the point of smurfing. However, smurfing is easy to catch now if multiple accounts are owned by the same entity.
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:47:24
The point of cryptocurrencies used in money laundering is that it is harder for law enforcement to out a face on who is laundering the money. Bank accounts, paypal, etc, will trigger alarms early on and in most cases, smurfing won't work unless many shell entities and purchasing orders are used to cover up the account's trails. That costs money and time, for that same investment, a money launderer can clean much more money using cryptocurrencies because:
1) Transactions process faster than wires.
2) Privacy coins offer total anonymosity that even law enforcement cannot break through.
3) Tumblers are still useful when the provider is legitimate.
4) ICO's are safer bets when the goal is to launder tens of millions of dollars.

If you use TA to predict future price action, then yes, you are setting yourself for massive losses. If you use TA as an indicator of trends and couple it with different other factors, it can be a very powerful tool.
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:02:43
If it is what you think it is, ICO exit scams, exchange hacks and other illicit activities would be much less prevalent and the perpetrators would be getting caught every single time.
But we are definitely observing these operations happen for larger scale schemes, rather than the street dealer trying to launder his $50,000 in drug proceeds. Bitcoin might not be the best choice to take part in money laundering practices because law enforcement can definitely track your movements. However, after using tumblers, privacy coins and ICO schemes, it becomes almost impossible to track dirty money.

Now your arguments are based on emotion and fear but in reality, nobody has an interest in giving a shit about your assets unless you make bank. The average joe doesn't have to behave like he needs a swiss bank account in his pockets because he has absolutely nothing to protect. If you have such disbelief in the system (We both agree it is corrupt), then go dark. Sell all your fiat for cryptos and quit bitching about the banks 24/7. Oh wait. You won't. Because your chuck-e-cheese shitcoins are not worth anything and Bitcoin is not accepted everywhere, causing you a new handicap in your ability to "freely use your money". Then it's back to square one, who is going to be the devil now ? The whales ? The illuminati ?
In the present state, nobody but the idiotic deluded libertarians care about cryptos replacing fiat. The reality is, they will both coexist and have great usage in their own extent. Nobody will accept moving all their assets in a low-volume market that is being manipulated by even fewer players than traditional markets.
Again, hate the banks so much ? Quit using them. Simple. For me, a bank being corrupt or whales pump and dumping coins are the same thing and believing otherwise is the definition of delusion.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:44:46
It's very easy to manipulate high volume coins. Even Ripple which was highly liquid and had an outstanding circulating supply in the billions managed to get pumped and  dumped repeatedly. Adoption won't happen until the market purges itself from the hundreds of worthless shitcoins that have no reason to exist. (No real use case nor intrinsic value, shady deals, mafia insider ownership that can crush the coin's value at anytime, etc). Nano, NEO, EOS, Litecoin, PRL, Tezos, all need to go.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:04:00
Everyone is corrupt. From your crypto influencers to the government. Privacy coins will be a massive failure because law enforcement will not allow it. Several asian exchanges are delisting Monero because of money laundering concerns. If you have nothing to hide, then you shouldn't be so concerned about being transparent. If you want privacy, open an offshore trust, and then register bank accounts under it. Your chuck-e-cheese tokens with "privacy functions" are only used by criminals so don't bitch about banks being corrupt, everyone is.
@_date: 2018-10-28 23:47:13
It's their business, they set the rules they please. Nobody gives a fuck about your privacy concerns or even you as a person. Trust me.
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:43:47
You agreed to their rules when you opened your account so quit being a pleb and explain yourself, they can't care less about your peanuts. If you are doing shady shit and have a constant in and out flow, they will want to know. It's their business because your money transits through their institution. Not happy ? Go dark or open an offshore bank account like the big boys do.
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:48:10
Then say so. It's really that simple. There is no illuminati conspiracy to prevent you from using your own money. But if you want to use their services, you will abide by their requirements or find another institution.
Why is everyone on here acting like wannabe Pablo Escobars pretending like the banks give a shit about their money ? If you got nothing to hide then tell them what you are doing or simply choose an option you feel like to dissimulate your activities. No need to write up shitposts like this and spin it like some sort of social struggle lol.

1. Tether just hired lawyers to confirm a bank balance and that can mean anything. They could have sold cryptos to fit the bank balances with the supply for the check.
2. It was not an audit, nobody knows how the money got there and nobody knows if that money is legit.
3. If you really think Bitfinex never manipulated Bitcoin with tether then you are part of the reasons why this market is a shit show in the first place.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:01:10
Bitfinex is a shady exchange ran by a holding company registered in an off\-shore territory with no U.S. extradition and that uses nominee directors to hide the identities of the people behind it. It is also behind tether, and prints new amounts of tether regularly to keep the exchange solvent.
You should have done your research before depositing this kind of funds. You have very little recourse over them, other than harassing them and hoping that they are nice enough to let you withdraw your funds.
Due diligence doesn't stop with coins only, you must do it with the exchanges you deal with as well.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:39:41
Your "argument" was not an argument. You simply asserted that just because he is a "permabull", he absolutely cannot take advantage of market swings and hedge against market down turns by short-selling. That is not an argument, that is stupidity at its finest. Having worked with several institutional investors, and accredited investors with several millions in assets, you can be sure that these people will never sit and watch their holdings depeciate when they can take advantage of obvious market down turns.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:43:59
It was obvious yes, the new year has been historically marked by a swiff correction in digital asset prices. If you actually bothered to do your research instead of listening to the idiots in this sub, you would have knew about it as well.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:16:54
There is no timing needed to short. All you need is a bearish sentiment and a ledger showing more sellers than buyers. Draper and the click are in it for the money, not for bullshit idealistic fantasies that led most of this sub to sit on their losses.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:10:06
The ''HODL'' slang is just a meme, not an investment strategy. You people who keep taking this slang seriously are the first ones to lose money, always. If you see decent profits, sell, lock in profits, and wait for a correction to get back in. If you don't have the discipline to do that, you should not be investing in the first place. Go buy a mutual fund and sit on it if you want to ''HODL''.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:10:25
Just because the guy is a "permabull" doesn't mean he won't take advantage of the obvious bearish sentiment and place a short\-sell order on bitcoin to make money and hedge his long positions. Smart investors do that, clowns "HODL" and rake up massive losses in the process by posting memes on reddit. It's not trading, and it's not "timing the market", it's simply buying low and high.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:06:42
If you think Draper and Winklevoss just ''HODL'' like retards, never take short the market and take advantage of market distortions, you are naive. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:58:11
It's exactly because of this clown mentality that pollutes the cryptocurrency markets that we are in a bear market.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:48:20
That is a good point.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:47:25
That is not consistent enough. Wash trading is a proven tactic and has been used by both major players and exchanges themselves to manipulate prices downwards so they could short the same assets they hold on the side.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:14:18
The crash was highly predictable back in december. Every signs of a speculative bubble were there, and any smart investor actually sold his holdings during that time. The only people that "HODL" through these times are either 1) Highly inexperienced investors, mostly retail investors who take crypto memes seriously and 2) Actually short\-selling BTC to hedge against their long position's losses.
@_date: 2019-02-03 05:30:26
190 millions goes a long way if you want to disappear. They never had "employees", just temporary contractors. That money is not lost, you can be sure of that. We at BlockHaven have called this fraud since september 2018, and have been called clowns repeatedly. Oh well. We feel bad that so many people got caught up in this mess.
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:16:37
None. And he "died" from a disease that only has 3% mortality rate. It was an exit scam. The founder is not dead.

Inb4 OP was actually doing money laundering through smurfing activities and got busted.
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:42:57
The very same fraud that is being done by banks is being done with cryptocurrencies.
\- Money laundering ? Check. Just look at how most ICOs are rampant money laundering schemes.
\- Pump and dumps ? Check.
\- Price manipulation ? Check.
\- Allowing retards to be over leveraged and lose all their money stupidly ? Check.
Quit bitching about the banks being evil when this market has the exact same problems as banks, except with even less regulations lol.

No pity for stupidity. Sucks that it happened though. I wish him the best.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:15:09
If this is true, you're an idiot.
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:36:29
Quit mentioning Wall Street, they are the last of your concerns if you care about Bitcoin.
If banks holding BTC is bad but nobody bats an eye that most of the supply is owned by a few crypto oligarchs then you are a hypocrite.
Decentralization stops the moment someone takes control of the circulating supply. And right now most banks only own a fraction of what these crypto oligarchs own.
