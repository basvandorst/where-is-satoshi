I thought they were stolen.

me too. i have a vague memory from years ago (must have been right around when they came out) about bitcoin mining. it was presented as "make money by letting a program run on your computer 24/7" which sounded kind of fishy to me, and then people were saying the extra cost of electricity outweighed the income, so i ignored it.

any finite resource can be used to store value. gold is hard to counterfeit and you can carry pieces of it in your pocket, so it's a naturally convenient currency. bitcoin follows the same principles, but digitally.

i'm with you. i started watching bitcoin when it was $45 a while ago. i wish it would crash hard so i can buy some on the cheap.

i haven't purchased any btc, but i am a curious observer of btc. i'm hoping for a crash so i can buy a few btc on the cheap. i think it's safe to say that the price can't rise continuously forever, but no one can say when it will crash. take the housing bubble in the US for example. housing prices kept rising until they crashed, but it took several years before the crash happened. the btc price will probably fall, but it could tomorrow or 5 years from now.

Bitcoins can store value because they are finite. It helps that they are decentralized and mostly anonymous.

probably just a weekend dip, but i hope it crashes hard.
