thanks.. i'll see what i can see

ow would you have 100 coins if you never mined

for example:
looking around the best $ for return i can see is a 20gh/s module that's stacks to 10 per 1 usb cable... is this supposed to be good by current standards.. the way i gather it, the hash's massively complicate ever time a unit is completed

my friend,i meant no direct offence... i took the opal digging as a joke.  i returned with a equally mining joke.

not after fast dollars... but if its sustainability profitable i'm happy to contrubute
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:36:43
i once thought as such... but i can tell you i have maxed out the number of connections my pc can handle on a single usb hub... as it is now i have to swap between peripherals as i need to use them

i have a couple of opals somewhere.. but they came from the other side of the country. sadly i'm no scientist, i can not convert opals to uranium or know if it is even possible...

i wasn't opposed to buying some hardware... 
is there a way of finding out whats the value vs return on hardware?
edit: there is shit load of gold in Australia... at least that's what the man says
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:45:04
well certainly doesn't seem worth it then
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:57:36
well i think i will support the protocol at some point either way... i currently have 5 systems so i can run a thread on one of them, even if its just a usb ASIC.  
i'm not just here to get max profits for my power consuption. infact i gather that attitude is whats reducing the value of the btc.
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:41:45
so say i attempted to join the community.. 
how many Gh/s am i having to look at to be worth it?
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:07:16
maybe i'm reading this wrong but it doesnt inspire confidence
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:57:47
from what i gather i should be able to find uranium in anyone back yard, its our highest value export
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:58:51
bit of a copy paste, sorry

.... i didn't think its was exclusively Australian humor
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:08:38
yeah i've seen images of people with pretty crazy setups
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:51:55
oh wow... so they are all designed by electronic engineers and prfessionaly pressed circuit boards... they just got lazy with the case?
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:09:37
yeah.. the ASIC miners i was looking at aren't cheap.. 
this is why i'm hear asking these things.
i've seen 2gh usb modules for not much money... but you can only connect so many usb devices to your pc
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:43:24
i am willing to make it more then a hobby... i have wasted alot of cpu time on seti
i'm just trying to get an idea of cost vs return.  or more hopefully a a way of buying a system thats progressively upgrade-able as it earns
