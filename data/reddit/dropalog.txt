You protested that selling insurance was not their primary service. I asked what their primary service is, and how it is monetized.


It's hard (and unprofitable) to use Bitcoin for everyday commerce with or without BitPay. That's why I don't, and use a CC. Which offers buyer protection, cash back, and lends me money for free.


In other words, BitPay's loss, if the tx gets double-spent, is nothing. They offer this service at zero risk to themselves. That's what I wanted to hear.


Again, no small business I know refuses cash as a form of payment. Most Bitcoin businesses refuse zero-conf transactions. If  the risks of accepting zero-conf. tx are lower than those for cash, why is that? Are they just messing with us?

Yes, algorithms just like the kind insurance companies use to calculate insurance premiums. Some insurance companies make their algorithms public, some do not.
Now, to make this conversation less one-sided, and bring it back to your "0 conf has a relatively low p compared to cash" claim: you suppose there's an insurance company offering cash transaction insurance? For $75(or some other sum)/mo, they allow you to accept cash, up to $10, and if it turns out to be counterfeit, they'll reimburse you? Taking into account the fact that the number of cash transactions, for an average business, will exceed those of Bitcoin txs by several orders of magnitude, how much do you suppose such insurance should cost?

OK, think of it like this: 
100 transactions need to be made in a 10-minute timespan. This could happen in one of two ways: all on-chain, with the miners reaping all the tx fees, or 2 on-chain tx (because that's what our hypothetical small blocks fit), for which the miners can charge whatever they want, and the rest in LN (where fees are also paid).

No, there are all kinds of crazies in the world, I'd question his money management skills tho. Because $1,200 in a country like Venezuela is a lot of money.

Not sure what you're saying. Empty (minimal size, 1 tx) blocks are mined all the time, at least one was mined today. Are you confusing blocksize limit &amp; actual block size?


This will be impossible if LN works. LN working as it should would mean that the mempool doesn't keep growing, i.e. blocks aren't always full.

Why is that? I own many things that are neither practical nor good for/useful to society as a whole. Don't you?


Not at all. If a currency's buying power increases by 10% a year, and a business offers 9% yearly ROI, why... that breaks "always" right there. Bitcoin's buying power increased ...what, more than 200% in the past year? If that sort of "deflation" was guaranteed, what fool would invest in a business with 9% yearly returns?


Like the house they live in, which appreciates? Most "unsophisticated poor people" (as in half of the world) live on a bit more than 2 dollars a day. Really. They don't *have* any discretionary income to save. You know who has money to save? *Rich people.* 
*Rich people* have disposable income &amp; money to save. The poors wouldn't even have the $2 they have now, because rich people are smart, will keep their money in a mattress, where it nets them 200% yearly returns, instead of employing bothersome, unsightly, and unreliable poor people to make just 9%. 
So stop wit the "it's good for the poors" rhetoric.

The annual median per capita income in India stood at $616, the 99th position among 131 countries. That's about $1.70 (a buck seventy) a day. Not much money.
More fun facts about India: 
India is a vast ~~South Asian~~ Not African country with diverse terrain and population of 1,267,401,849 Indians, as of July 1 2014. That's 17.5% of the world's total population. India is also home to Indian elephants and ~~British~~ cars unironically called "Hindustan Ambassador," but not to India ink, which comes from China.

Dear ignorant person:
Electricity is subsidized by the government in Venezuela, and that's why the article is titled "The Secret, Dangerous World of Venezuelan Bitcoin Mining," rather than "The Above-Board, Totally Legit World of Venezuelan Bitcoin Mining." 
Electricity is paid for indirectly, through taxes. Much like public schools are paid for by taxes in United States. You may feel that taxation is theft, and that justifies you stripping out school's plumbing &amp; selling it for scrap to the scrapyard; you may see yourself as a modern Robin Hood, a paradigm-shifting entrepreneur daring to disrupt and innovate, but I assure you, you're not. Doing that would make you a thief, human garbage. Much like Alfredo.
Socialism, in this case, is neither here nor there: theft is theft.


Yes, and during WW2, food was rationed, in the most socialist, un-free-markety way possible. And there were scumbags like Alfredo, who figured out ways to beat the rationing system, and fattened pigs on the bread rations they stole. While others starved. Those are your heroes.

No, they don't. If LN works as it should, people will keep channels open for longer and longer periods, and (since channels are bidirectional) if LN works as intended, it's possible never need to settle on-chain.
But forget about intricacies, think of it like this:
Imagine that each [hypothetical] block fits one tx. Miners mine for 10 minutes, and fit one in. 1tpM. 
With SegWit, this hypothetical blocks will fit 2 tx. No more. Miners will never be able to charge for more than 2 tx, no matter how the network grows -- the rest of txs will have to (eventually) happen in LN, or not happen.
The miners want to increase blocksize, and keep increasing it as technology advances. so instead of 2 tx, they can charge for all tx on the network. Not just 2.

Bitcoin is neither here nor there. If by "deflationary" you mean a currency with decreasing base money supply, Bitcoin isn't a deflationary currency (12.5 BTC is issued every 9-10 minutes). The more common definition is price deflation, (1 coin  buys 1 cow now, will buy 2 cows in a year's time). If a deflationary currency doesn't buy more tomorrow than it does today, then we're talking about a *failing* deflationary currency. Agreed? 
You claimed that investments will *always* net better returns than a deflationary currency. I've given you an example of a currency that buys 10% more in a year's time (1.1 cows), and a business that nets only 9% ROI (in buying power, buys 1.09 cows). It is profitable in terms of wealth (1.09 cows is better than 1 cow), but only a fool would run such a business, because it *loses money* (1.09 cows is worth less than 1 coin, you lost money). That's the refutation of your claim, Q.E.D.


Large portion of the US population lives on credit; they're spending money they do not have. It is because of this credit that US economy is better than that of Somalia, and the US poor live like kings, compared to Somali poors.

"Historical evidence"? History shows us that everything that is born dies. This is not an argument for giving up on life, or that any life that eventually ends is a failure.


Only if people dedicate their lives to promoting the U$D and quote its mysterious creator like Granny quotes her Red Letter Bible. 
Getting back to religion vs. cult: When you live in a Christendom, going to church on Sunday is simply going with the flow, conforming to your society's norms -- to be able to dedicate your time to shit you actually care about. If you don't care about religion, that's the optimal thing for you to do. In such a society, atheism would be only for those *who are passionate about religion*, i.e. hate it. An open atheist would sacrifice social acceptance and ...a bunch of other stuff for his "truth." See where I'm going? 


Of course. You can reject things because you can't imagine how they would work, or because you can. I can only speak for myself.
Edit: By "you can" I meant "one can."

No. Here's what a Bitcoin transaction is:
"A [Bitcoin] transaction is a transfer of Bitcoin value that is broadcast to the network **and collected into blocks.** A transaction typically references previous transaction outputs as new transaction inputs and dedicates all input Bitcoin values to new outputs." --Bitcoin Wiki


Once you broadcast it, it will be a bitcoin tx. Just like a cash transaction that you can make (exists in your mind or on some spreadsheet) is not a cash transaction until you make it

If you want to get technical, since Core's just a bunch of people who chose to work together, how, exactly, did f2pool break [this agreement]( And with whom?
Of course, whoever or whatever made promises, or, rather, vague, qualified hints about what may be hoped for at certain points in time... well, let's just say it's a good thing they don't make promises or plans for a living.






Of course, gullible miners thought they were dealing with representatives of the core *team*, and felt like chumps once Core [correctly] pointed out that the individuals had no authority to make promises on Core's behalf.

*There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .*
*And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail.

Produced thoughtful, edifying memes. Not the disappointing fucking turds the youngsters "lel on" nowadays.
So as I was sayin', there we was, torchin' a fine middle-of-the-road-Columbian spliforino ("blowing a roofer," as we hep cats used to call it), and right out of the blue, he goes up to The Man and blurts out "There's no God, you piece of ignorant pigshit!

So allowing, for the moment, that f2pool did break the agreement, does this invalidate the agreement, and allow the individuals who were mistakenly assumed to speak on behalf of the Core team (by miners, Bitcoin press, r/bitcoin &amp; bitcointalk.org forum), to break this agreement vis-a-vis the rest of "Chinese miners" (all the pools that are not f2pool)?

I have said no such thing. Every large cult *is* a religion. What I said was *"Not everything that's not a small cult is a religion."* I'll single-step you:
1. All large cults are religions
2. Not everything that's not a small cult is a large cult
3. Ergo, not everything that's not a small cult is a religion, Q.E.D.
See the difference? A giant pangolin is not a small cult, nor is it a religion. Mental sloppiness. It'll get you every time.


I never suggested that fiat currency is not a religion, that's why. On the contrary, I said that large cults, or *religions," are large because they are successful. Again, it's very important to understand what you're raging against. Before raging.


Cultists are not taking the path less traveled, they're herd animals, crave peer validation so much that they all hang out together, communally hugging &amp; circle-jerking in their compounds, lockgrooved in groupthink. 
Like here.
They don't and can't strike out on their own, because loner with his own set of ideas is not a cultist. By definition.

Never told you to pay your landlord with the CC. Let your weird bank mail out checks, like it's doing right now, automatically, taking exactly 0 minutes and 00 seconds of your valuable time. Since you seem concerned about your rent being sent 5 days in advance? Then "If your bank account is always overdrawn &amp; 5 days matter, get a CC that lends you money." Get it?


Good, then you are already playing with money that you don't have,  so since you get all this money at least a month before you earn it, paying your landlord 5 days in advance shouldn't be a problem. If it actually is, you got bigger ones.


Not at all. I'm concerned with how quickly I can have shit I pay for. With a CC, it's "right away." And then I get all the perks, like CCs paying me to play with *their* money.

Not sure. $20.67 bought a z before 1933, after '34 it was $35/oz. To me, if the amount of gold backing a bill could randomly change, that's no longer a standard.
There's still some gold held by the FED, so I guess at any point in time a dollar could be mapped to a quantity of gold held by the fed. Not a gold standard as I understand it. 
It's all weird and complicated, with gold certificates until '33, [silver certificates used as paper money until '64]( which sounds like [bimetalism]( to me but apparently isn't. Not sure why everyone fixates on this stuff. The price of gold is constantly changing, so it's not like an ounce of gold is guaranteed to buy you a cow in a year any more than $1100 is guaranteed to buy you that cow.

The reson that no currency in the world is deflationary is because deflationary currencies don't work. They look good, but only until you begin to understand that if people don't spend, they also don't buy, and if people don't buy, then making stuff for them to buy is pointless -- the stuff you produce in your factory will sit and rot in a warehouse. 
Then you, the productive factory owner, will get that light bulb moment: "Hey, if I just keep my money in a mattress, I'll make more than I would investing it in a factory that employs people &amp; makes things (that I can't sell).

I don't use BitPay, but would not buy something just to find out if they accept 0-conf tx, even if I did. I'm weird that way.

Well sure, though "difficult to steal" is debatable. A huge percentage of coins in circulation has already been stolen, 70 mil just recently, from BFX. So if you never use Bitcoin as one would use money, and keep it in a paper wallet buried under your birdbath, it is, in fact, difficult to steal. Though the same goes for filthy fiat.
Now, while Bitcoin does, arguably, have some advantages, it (like Beanies and bottle caps) has some serious disadvantages: like no stores want to take it as money, for one.

Like the blockchain, yes.


This is where I get lost. These "distinct and individual" things (UTXOs) are ["used as input to the spend transaction [...] and destroyed forever,"]( becoming two distinct and separate UTXOs -- one in the recipient wallet, one as change in the sender's wallet. So these tokens are no different than a database entry -- can be created and are not monadic (as in basic, indivisible). Sure, they can't be created willy-nilly, they have to comply with Bitcoin's ruleset, but same goes for Visa transactions.
So, to see if I'm getting it:
1. UTXOs can be created from other UTXOs (sending coin to a different address).
2. UTXOs don't have a fixed value (can be anywhere from dust to millions of BTC)
3. UTXOs are divisible (one UTXO is destroyed and one or more UTXOs are created when Bitcoin is "spent")
4. All UTXOs are stored on the blockchain (once parsed by a client, in the UTXO database ), not in one's wallet. To access "stored value," the ~~bank's database~~ blockchain must be secured by ~~bank's employees~~ the miners. One can not do anything with one's UTXOs without both of the above.
I'm not a cryptologist, or even a coder, but if ~~all~~ edit: some of the above is correct, UTXOs are odd tokens...

If having more tokens with lower total worth (buying power) is what you meant to do, you won. Not quite as much as you'd have by buying tokens that became totally worthless (lost 100% of their dollar worth), but losing 80% is pretty impressive too. Kudos!

Supply = all the coins mined to date. It is not cut in half, it's ~17 million &amp; will continue to increase after teh halvening, albeit at a slower rate. 


Transaction are a pretty small part of the take. An average block contains [just ~2,000 transactions]( To make up the halvening difference (-6.25 BTC/block; ~-$20k), an average tx fee would need to be $20k /2k transactions per block = $10 surprize.gif
Te miners will just keep doing what they're doing now -- enough will  [go belly-up]( making mining more profitable for the ones that remain. 
TL;DR: unless my math is off by several orders of magnitude (possible, am lazy and stupid)/amazing new hashing tech comes on the market/price skyrockets into wet-dream territory, hash rate will fall.

Not how exchanges work. 
While your coin is on an exchange, it stays in the exchanges wallet, regardless of the trades you make.

No, it simply moves from one account to another (which can then sell it again). This is called *trading*.
