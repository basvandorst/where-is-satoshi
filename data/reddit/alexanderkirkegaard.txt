1.) Its the new normal. Its hard to diversify properly with only a few listings, so its a low point for everyone involved. Fewer listings means fewer investors which means less capital which means less lenders. The US market is huge, so you can def. feel the effect of cutting it off.
On the other hand, BTCjam seems to be expanding in spanish-portuguese-speaking countries.
2.) Net-ARB has been acting unpro. So has BTCjam. NetArb tried to round up investors to pursue court rulings with one of their lawyer partnership.
BTCjam on the other hand, scooped up default notes to pursue on the cheap with their own collection agency, to avoid controversies with laws in the US.
So suddenly Net-ARB and BTCjam had a very stupid and very unpro conflict of interest.
Long term, NetARB is being replaced with another arbitrage agency. And BTCjam will have to get its shit together.
3.) If US users default, the (new) arbitrage agency ruling will (as always) let investors pursue justice and enforcement in courts - And the investor will win. And can defer to a collection agency.
I use BTCjam to handle a local danish loan with a guy I know personally. An arbitrage award is plenty for me to ensure I get my money back - Via the courts or otherwise.

... You don’ think its sad to bash on some guy you dont even know?
Niklas has been working in crypto for years, and been one of the swizz bitcoin pioneers in zug. He even did the whole Liberland thing.

Nah, he is taking a gamble. All in on this.
But I remembers years back when bitcoin was new, just about the time the first bitcoin shops popped up, then the exchanges. I'd say he is too late.

I think its great you post. None can know if your gamble will work. But I think its cool of you to document it. Can you show us a few graphs of what you have returned so far?
