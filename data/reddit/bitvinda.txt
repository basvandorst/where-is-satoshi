Yup I agree... but for me it's looking more and more like the bitcoin blockchain isn't quite appropriate for mainstream users yet (and I'm ok with that). If the weirdness of the fees and wait times don't get them, the volatility surely will.
For now, mainstream users would probably be far more comfortable on things like Circle/Coinbase, and eventually when more decentralised versions of these (things like LN &amp; bitsquare.io) start getting implemented properly we'll see more new waves of adoption for the less and less tech savvy folks. I'm actually in the camp that is for not rushing things to get a (probably insignificant) short-term bump in usability at the expense of permanently breaking something core to the bitcoin protocol's value.

Definitely Circle if you've got a debit card in the US or UK. Quick process, decent rates.
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:10:24
Ouch that wallet has 250 unspent outputs! You're definitely going to have to take some time and consolidate those transactions. I'd recommend pulling the private key into a client that allows you full control of the fee amount (Bitcoin Core is the only I know of) and to then set the lowest fee possible ([maybe something between 1-20 satoshis per byte](
The transaction would take a day or two to be mined, and you may have to resubmit it a few times if it drops entirely from the network before being mined, but that's the only way I know of to get around a high transaction fee for a wallet in this state. That replace-by-fee functionality should come in nicely here if you start really low and then keep incrementally stepping up the fee and rebroadcasting until the transaction gets mined.

@_date: 2018-01-26 09:51:49
Ah ok, but how does a censorship soft fork actually work? 
I'll lay out how I see it, and please correct me wherever I'm off:
* Miner A (51% malicious aggregate) creates a censored block
* Miner B (49% honest aggregate) creates 2 consecutive non-censored blocks at some point in the next 8 blocks (a relatively high probability event) on top of the *"censorship soft fork"* using the honest redemption txn that's still in their mempool.
* At this point, Miner A must now race to create 2 censored blocks and a 3rd non-censored one before Miner B can mine a 3rd block on top the current longest chain if Miner A is to maintain the censorship on the soft fork it created... an extremely low probability event given the slim ~4% edge-by-hashrate that Miner A would have over Miner B
It's the kind of race dynamic that is set up in a "selfish mining attack" scenario which requires a *much* higher edge than just 51% of the network, and that would have far more sinister implications than a simple LN steal.
Btw, I'm just nitpicking this one point here. The rest of the write-up is superb!
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:49:43


How real of a threat is this? Even with 51% of the mining network, that just gives you a higher probability of finding the next block, but it doesn't give any strong guarantees that you find **all** of the next *n* blocks. All it would take is one honest miner finding a block during the time that your channel closure txn is broadcast to the network, which is very high probability assuming that there are more than 3 or 4 blocks left before your relative locktime expires after broadcast (and assuming selfish mining isn't happening). Is this sort of perspective I'm thinking of sound @_date: 2017-12-16 12:34:38
Copay actually [does have]( a custom fee option. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:04:18
This! 
Actually if you think about, miners are incentivised to spam the network... constantly. From a purely profit-seeking perspective, they'd always want to push fees to "highest fee top 20k transactions are willing to pay" because they can spam for free and collect high legit fees in block rewards, and in the case where they get it wrong and some of their spam transactions get confirmed, they'd very likely receive some portion of their own fees back and can readjust at that point.
Tldr: miners are incentivised to spam network up to "highest fee richest transaction senders are willing to pay".
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:50:43
On the contrary, I believe it has the potential to rebalance that very power dynamic if we can implement it correctly. Bitcoin has within it the power to simultaneously
* Increase transparency &amp; accountability through this technology (once we can push the right social contracts to enforce this) &amp;,
* Vastly increase the average person's ability to defend their privacy/sovereignty
Bitcoin, arguably, is **one of the most private** and **one of the most transparent** forms of currency/payments we've ever seen.

Yea on the individual front I can't explain too much on how anonymity is maintained. I personally use Mycelium which generates new addresses for each transaction to maintain some level of anonymity. I guess this last point is pretty much the point of the article though, that if it really is that easy to extrapolate a person's holdings based on their spending patterns or other techniques, then why is it that we haven't identified any of those early bitcoiners yet? That's your test to validate how well bitcoin can provide anonymity right now.

I much prefer the ['bootstrap paradox']( version of things; that a time traveller from the future who has managed to work out where (which ip) the whitepaper was published from comes back to 2008 to meet Satoshi, and when on getting there he realises that Satoshi is nowhere to be found &amp; is faced with the possibility of a world without Bitcoin decides to publish the whitepaper himself thereby becoming Satoshi Nakamoto. He then stays on and helps code bitcoin into reality until such time it can sustain itself at which point he pops back into his time machine and returns to his future.

He/she probably only brought back the original whitepaper (to have it signed in some way of course) and their vague memories from archaeological examinations of the Bitcoin blockchain &amp; Bitcoin Core git archives.

@_date: 2015-12-14 11:39:38
This is how I understand it. All bitcoin transactions are completely open and persons can track any transaction all the way back to when those btc were first created. The only thing that protects anonymity is us not being able to link a person/entity to any address or set of addresses (bitcoin's pseudonymity). Once that link is made and the protection broken, for that entity bitcoin transitions from being reasonably anonymous to completely transparent.
So at the outset, we can assume all users of bitcoin are anonymous until they can be linked to their pseudonyms (public addresses). This is where the "social contract" point comes in. Bitcoin gives us the ability to track all transactions once we have the associated addresses. It is up to society now to make it mandatory that our various institutions and entities disclose all relevant addresses or address seeds that they use to give us this transparency.
*p.s. the mechanism to disclose is fairly easy to do, it's that* ***will to disclose*** *that's the problem*

Did my [1st ever real world transaction]( here exactly two weeks ago. They use a version of the blockchain.info wallet and it did take some time for the guy to set up the payment on their device. He was super friendly and accommodating, but it was a bit of a slow period on a Monday evening.
What's weird too was that their wallet didn't notify them of the payment being received (a problem the guy told me they've always had). How he verifies is by looking at the payment on my end (I used Airbitz) to make sure he sees something sent through my wallet. Not the most secure way to do it I'm guessing. They need to revisit that whole process.

This is counter-intuitive, you've double counted somewhere. By definition the long side of the trade produces the exact opposite of the short side. If the long side gains (from a price increase) the short side loses the same amount so that the net position remains constant. What ends up happening is the gains of one position are used to cover the losses of the other so that the net position is always constant.
[I've run out a simple simulation at a few different price points to demonstrate how this would work.]( 
This sort of arrangement is something I've actually made use of in a bitcoin-related business I run where we are often put into undesired short positions (much like Abra users) that we would need to hedge our way out of using a similar strategy. 
The key innovation that Abra claims is that they are able to do this in **some sort of automated way** and **without having access to the bitcoin holders' stashes of bitcoin** apparently. That's the piece I'd be interested in seeing how they've worked out.
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:41:32


So this is the thing I'm really interested in seeing. The diagram is meant to prove that the base math works. It's how to do this counterparty-lessly that I'm interested in. I wouldn't go so far as calling it impossible. Lots of things seem impossible until they're done. If they say they've done it then I'd more take the approach of healthy skepticism until they can explain how.
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:40:06


My one question is, how does _"non-custodial control"_ work in the case of **fiat** balances. Fiat by its nature isn't controlled by keys (unless Abra has figured out a way to cryptographically tokenize it in some decentralised way?).

@_date: 2017-02-15 12:48:30
Just gave that podcast a listen. Great share, thanks! There's two things in your comment though that I don't entirely agree with.


Not sure he made this exact claim. IIUC he said that the counterparties are long bitcoin which means that even without Abra they would be naturally exposed to price fluctuations relative to fiat (as for e.g. I am with the bitcoin I hold in cold storage). What I gather is that instead of bitcoin just sitting in an address, Abra allows those folks to submit those bitcoins for the opportunity to earn some small interest. The principal amount denominated-in-bitcoin is preserved afaict in such an arrangement for those counterparties.
In this sort of scenario, if I were one of those counterparties my actual concern would then be how securely my bitcoins were being held in that relationship, and whether the interest earned would be worth the additional risk of storing it outside my own cold storage options.


In a one-to-one scenario this would be problematic, but I wonder if this sort of thing is not feasible in a pooled sort of arrangement. If Abra had a pool of staked bitcoin to draw from to create the hedges on demand, and they could guarantee that the pool doesn't drop below some amount that ensures they always have a &gt;1:1 relationship to the fiat they're trying to hedge, then I can see scenarios where it's possible for depositors to leave at any time to a certain extent. At that point, you start to get to a fractional reserve sort of paradigm (in terms of matching bitcoin deposits to hedges) where you'd need to ensure that there isn't a "run" on your Bitcoin allotted for hedging. If you can find the right pool of Bitcoin long holders and develop the right relationships, I imagine that this isn't an insurmountable problem.
I have no idea if this is how any of this actually works, but as a thought experiment I can see how they might be able to find ways around some of these challenges thrown up here. Please do feel free to poke holes in any of the arguments I've proposed here.

My comments on this post may come across as a little "rah, rah" because I'm also from the Caribbean and am entirely too excited for this. We've have had to put up with our local crap payment systems for far too long, and even now getting your hands on bitcoin is such a pain as the local p2p market is almost non-existent and the alternatives include some mix of obtaining forex, wiring money to strange places or eating the exorbitant fees of a credit card route through avenues like Purse.io or as of the last few weeks Bitstamp.

I've done Uphold in the UK too, works great. Only thing is the time delay of about 3 - 5 days but they don't charge any fees for deposits (purchases) so the only thing you'd end up paying is any difference in the exchange rate (which in my experience tracks pretty closely with major exchanges).
For more instant purchases though, I use Circle.com with a linked debit card. It's more costly here though (1.4 - 1.8% range).

To improve security I also try to minimise the amount of time I actually have my Trezor connected to any device. I've loaded up my account onto Mycelium and use that to monitor and process new deposits. This also lets me use new addresses for new transactions for a bit more txn privacy than a paper wallet.
The only time I'd ever need to physically plug my Trezor in again is if I ever need to spend funds. That's extremely rarely, and even then it's only for a few seconds when Mycelium prompts me to connect the device for txn signing.

As I understand it, they are doing multiple things to get Bitcoin going in the Caribbean:
* Their fiat peg is being implemented using a colored coin platform ([Colu]( afaict ... this is to tackle the volatility problem head on and to provide a viable route for the avg merchant/consumers to jump into cryptocurrencies. For perspective, we have no viable merchant processing mechanisms like the ones Bitpay, Coinbase etc. offer available in the C'bean.
* They are spinning up an exchange using the [Alphapoint engine]( specifically for Caribbean currencies. A much needed on/off ramp for the region given how difficult it can sometimes be to get forex.
* They are building a user-friendly wallet that would be able to handle both bitcoin and their e-fiat (&lt;- that Colu fiat peg) similar to how Circle wallet now handles both Bitcoin and a USD peg.
I for one can't wait for them to implement some of these things. The C'bean has been a payments backwater for too long. Let's hope &amp; team can shake things up a bit.

Yup I know how to do the generating and signing outside of mycelium already. What I'm trying to do here isn't so much for practical purposes as it is for me just understanding how things work.
I already have the unsigned transaction that I created outside of mycelium (using a public address and unspent outputs from one of my derived addresses within mycelium). What I'm wondering is if there's any workaround to signing that raw transaction without breaking open the seed and manually getting that specific private key.

Fair enough, I may have been hasty. Still though, it is an annoying email given that they're no longer able to provide exchange services.

Exactly. Especially when you consider that if SatoshiLabs were to do the normal thing and accept a credit card, it would actually be a 4% - 9% fee for them as merchants having to work with payment processors and fraud mitigation.
Too much focus is being placed on just the consumer side and no-one is paying attention to merchant benefits as well.

wrote a great piece on this sort of thinking recently: [The Importance of Bitcoin Not Being Money](
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:21:12
There's also the point that free markets and trade weren't as big a part of their societies back then. Needs for daily life were satisfied from co-operation and close-knit relationships. Think about for example how often you might 'settle-up' with family members in the same household for daily essentials. Disposable income wasn't really a concept since outside their basic needs everything else was pretty much freely available. In short, their societies were totally different and not nearly as money-centric as ours are today, and so the incentive for counterfeiting or going-out-of-one's-way for more of the day's currency may not have been nearly as strong.
Don't hold me to this perspective though. I'm speaking from memory from a point I believed I picked up from one of these books (can't remember which):

I agree with you, we do need to scale. My issue is that the original commenter was making it out like Bitcoin is broken RIGHT NOW, when it really isn't. 
How we scale is an entirely different story, and there are good arguments on both sides. I'm actually not worried that we won't get there. We do have lots of brainpower behind this and while all the drama is messy, it's the nature of how development within a "democratic" system works. We're miles ahead now of where we were a year ago in terms of options and working implementations.

I've all but given up on them. The contracts were always marginal at best and didn't really compare to just buying the underlying coins outright and having them appreciate. 
The last straw for me though was when they canceled a bunch of my lifetime contracts around the halvening because of a clause that says that if mining rewards can't cover costs for 20 days at a time they'd do that.
Genesis Mining is def'ly one of the more legit operations, but cloud mining as a whole just stinks tbh.

True, my initial reaction was probably misdirected.
I was thinking after this too, about why they were so late with the notification (weeks after my actual btc activity). What if they knew they had to serve me this but they also knew they'd be closing soon. What if they withheld the notification and let me go about my btc activity until they knew the service would no longer be useful and only then did they send this notification through (to satisfy their regulatory overlords).
If that's the case, it would actually flip them to sort of the protagonists of this story instead.

I can offer two likely reasons. 
* For some it's an easy way to borrow funds for purchasing. In some countries, the rate you could resell at usually covers your cost of borrowing and then some. 
* For others, it's a way to bypass currency conversion controls. C/c debt is usually payable in each country's local currency and the bank is usually obligated to do the currency conversion on your behalf to repay Visa/Mastercard

If these all build on the original Bitcoin blockchain in a similar way that XT does, then 'Would you consider them all on-topic for this sub?' is irrelevant. They would have passed some base level of qualifying to be presented as topics on this sub, and it would then be up to the users to upvote/downvote as they saw fit.
Of course there has to be some level of common sense here too, in the unlikely case that the sheer number of different alt-implementations gets to spammy levels. If any of those alt-implementations have been under the same level of scrutiny and have had the same level of core dev (and other stakeholder) buyin as both sides of the block size debate has had, then by all means they should be presented for discussion.
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:52:39
Very comprehensive so far, thanks much.
Taking bitcoind specifically to continue now, how would it operate in a situation where XT hits 75% consensus in 2016, &gt;1MB blocks are created and a new fork of the blockchain is formed? I also mean this within the context of having both Core and XT installed on my system.
Also, a related question. Right now XT uses *my existing wallet.dat file and blockchain files* that were created through Core. Any idea how this would change if/when the above blockchain fork happens?

@_date: 2015-08-16 05:41:46
True. I've read a lot of the arguments for the increase, and tried to find the ones against (haven't come across many coherent ones), but until today I've kept a relatively open mind for both sides of the debate. This blatant censorship and attempting to shame XT though just pushes me to think that there may not be much rational-thinking going on over on the no-increase side.
Loaded up XT and casting my node vote. This was not the best way for me to come to this conclusion (and shame on those shill mods), but quite keen to see where this all goes!

I thought this too. I'm used to seeing empty blocks if it's found very quickly after the previous one. This one was found 32 minutes after the prior one though. Plenty of time to collect transactions from the mempool.
Reason I ask is it just seems dodgy given everything else that's been going on. I haven't checked back to see if this was a one-off thing or if they've done it before recently. Maybe it could be a technical glitch too... but if so that'd be an expensive glitch.

Thanks much. Let me preface this by saying that while I'm not dev-level-technically-savvy, I do very much want to understand the various components of this debate. You all do much appreciated yeoman service, and you all deserve that the value of your contributions be more widely known, accessible and understood. With that said...
I've been coming to appreciate your point on "everyone else" more as I've been reading on the various alternatives that were put forward (different BIPs etc., it's not binary at all). Jorge's post added another bit to the puzzle, as did the medium post, but here's where the problem starts. For a lot of us, much of the content is dispersed and piecing it together will always lead to flawed results for persons not technically-minded, not familiar with all the issues, and who do not actively follow the mailing lists and forums. Why Mike &amp; Gavin have been gaining support I think is because they've simplified their views and brought them together into forms that people can easily string together and digest. What's fucked up is that they seem to have oversimplified some aspects, and in some cases completely misrepresented some points about the debate, and unfamiliar persons are left none the wiser.
Now if it is that you all feel that the debate is irrelevant to other stakeholders who may not be devs or have access to devs to interpret, then the current course is fine and it would lead to all this uninformed reddit noise which is an unfortunate side effect. If on the other hand you all appreciate that while this is a technical issue there is merit in non-technical persons also being informed, then it may be worthy to explore bringing together some of the points and presenting them specifically as they relate to this issue. E.g. embarrassingly for me, [this post of yours was massively informative.]( 
When we're so deeply involved in these sorts of things, we can sometimes lose touch with how much details &amp; context we take for granted. I know this sort of thing is not a priority when there's so much else to do, but in situations like these it may be worth looking at if only to bring some balance to the ramble and to give your efforts the appreciation they deserve.

Hey how do the Mycelium miner fees work for the frugal option? I submitted a transaction about 4 or 5 hours ago with the 0.00001 fee and for some time I couldn't find it on the public network. Took my eye off of it and just checked back the app to see that it was not only submitted but had also been confirmed already too.
Does mycelium have some alternative way of broadcasting such transactions, or was it just a coincidence that the transaction got held up in the app, submitted much later and then confirmed in short order thereafter?

I think we're giving too much credit to our current institutions. As they're currently set up, they're not meant to make you think critically of the nature/origins of money. And as key actors within these institutions, that's why I can't fault anyone with the title 'Minister of Finance' for not jumping at new forms of money or questioning anything outside the existing paradigm. *As a rational thinking human being though, now that's an entirely different story.*


If we take the context where he is coming from (being immersed in economics), he probably means that bitcoin's current inflexible supply function, a function derived from math as represented in the tweets, is not ideal to the needs of our now dynamic and complex economies. It is a fair argument as he may be using the phrase 'regulated by human agency' to mean some form of responsive monetary policy. And a related question could then be, 'can algorithms work in conjunction with markets to automate this sort of monetary policy?'. It's an argument I've seen positioned in [this Epicenter Bitcoin episode]( where they discussed Bitcoin's volatility, its relation to its supply function, and what alternatives there might in the future within the cryptocurrency space to mitigate against this. 
Now I love Bitcoin as much as anyone on here and my career is actually heading down a very Bitcoin-centric path. It is because of this though that I welcome critical views on any and all aspects of the Bitcoin space. The space is still a very young one with very little real world testing at scale. I've seen many early critics dive deeper into the topic and then make an about-face on their perspective, in the process adding value from their own unique insights. 
I guess what I'm getting at is that **I just found it a bit immature to attack a guy on a 2-year-old critical comment** without trying to get some more updated idea of his position. It really doesn't help the wider space, especially given Mr. Varoufakis' recent experiences. Just think what would have happened if Wences Casares had taken the same approach to Bill Gates (an open early opponent to Bitcoin) when he met him instead of trying to empathize with his stance and then present coherent reasons for why Bill should take a second look. Wences may never have been able to elicit Bill's change in perspective and statement that, *"You know what? I told the foundation not to touch Bitcoin and that may have been a mistake."*

Playing devil's advocate, what about the cheaper more centralised systems he's referring to for those smaller transactions that, as far as users can tell, gives the same functionality they're looking for as full-fledged bitcoin? (e.g. the no. of people today who transact within Coinbase's, Circle's, and Changetip's closed systems)
I assume he's seeing it as decentralisation having some intrinsic value so that necessarily: 
* cheap and widely available = centralised
* more expensive, exclusive = decentralised

They're actually going out via email to a particular mailing list we have, with the link to 'sweep via blockchain.info' included. It's a very small amount of bitcoin, and the idea is to get persons who might be completely new to bitcoin to open their own wallets. 
A disclaimer saying that bitcoins will be reclaimed by us after x days will be included in the email. The thinking is that if they haven't bothered clicking the link after some reasonable time, then they probably won't at all.

Ah ok, so the question then becomes whether I prefer to store my fiat with an exchange or with Crypto Capital, since in both cases I'd still probably have to do an international wire transfer to eventually get my fiat from my home bank to an exchange ready to be traded.
Following from this then, why would I choose to store my fiat with Crypto Capital? Is the only benefit that I'd just have to go through that whole AML/KYC process once?

Blockchain.info sort of facilitates this through their 'send via' options (email or SMS). Bitcoins are sent to a newly generated address, and the private key is sent along within a link to the person. When the persons clicks, they are taken to the blockchain.info site (or prompted to download the app I think) and then the btc are swept to their newly created wallet.
You can do it with any private address I believe. All you'd need to do is send along the address within a link like this:

Thanks. I do use standard fees for transactions that matter. This instance was me consolidating some outputs where the timing really didn't matter.
Another question. Is there any way to generate more than one empty address? Or, is there a way to skip to the next address in the HD chain without using the current one it displays? Why I ask is because I'm moving around outputs from different wallets and am trying to maintain some level of anonymity in the transactions.

To be fair though, those tweets of his were back in 2012 which is like eons ago in Bitcoin time.
Remember this is pre-Gox and pre-VCs when the general ecosystem was far less developed and there was far less *real world proof* that the technology could amount to anything. I also expect that Mr. Varoufakis would not have given nearly as much time as any of us here have to really understand this technology and its implications back then. Even Andreas has said that the 1st time he heard of bitcoin he dismissed it as a trivial thing. I myself took a full two weeks of consuming everything I could on the topic when I 1st got engrossed just in January of this year (a full 2.25 years after his tweet) before I felt that I had a comfortable grasp on the basics. 
He would have also evaluated Bitcoin through the lens of years and years of being deeply involved in economic theory and its more traditional manifestations. Often it's much harder to unlearn and then learn something new than it is to learn that same thing from scratch. It would be far more relevant to try to get a more recent opinion of his on the subject. I'm sure he would have a more informed view given all that has happened in the ecosystem and his own recent new experiences.
In the end, to me all this sort of post comes across as is taking a cheap shot at the guy. You're better than that @_date: 2015-07-26 16:08:54

Thanks, understood. I'm actually learning a lot through your answers about how these things work in general.  I do wonder though if there can be any compromise which maintains usability for basic users but that also allows:
* Some ability to customize transactions or choose outputs to be spent, and
* Some basic look ahead functionality that stays within the 20-address limit e.g. create up to 3 (&lt;- arbitrary no.) empty wallets
Maybe it could be through a mechanism like toggling an 'advanced mode' that enables some of these features. Just a thought.
Curious, has this sort of tradeoff ever been discussed amongst the devs?

Thanks. I actually tried sweeping multiple addresses through Electrum and ran into some problems too. Posted this earlier today across in &gt; I'm trying to sweep amounts from two private keys into one address in one transaction. When I put in the two addresses at the same time, electrum creates a partially signed transaction. If I put in either of the addresses separately, electrum creates the full transaction ready to be broadcast.

I think it's similar to when you SMS or email someone bitcoins as is done now through things like Coinkite and blockchain.info. The sender maintains control of the private keys too and can sweep that wallet at any time. It works the same for bit drops like [this one at McGill]( where they also maintained access to private keys.
I think the better questions is, *is there any way to send bitcoin to someone whose public address you do not have (or who may not have a public address yet) with a guarantee that only the intended recipient has access to funds?* Right now AFAIK the answer is 'no' which makes OP's solution a perfectly viable one for the intended use case. @_date: 2015-07-13 15:05:41
But what if the billionaire isn't holding that paper anymore? ... What if he's used mechanisms like what happened in the 2008 crisis to amass paper (debt) and then swiftly convert it into real wealth, things like physical assets and real estate, back when the paper still had value and meant debt? ... What if we no longer owe him because we've already been duped into paying up?

They do... but you don't get the kind of control of your keys like you would with Gear! I actually haven't come across any good PoS solutions that do the usual things (lets you separate permissions for employees, has reporting capabilities for transactions, has a good UI for both the payer and the payee), and that lets you control your keys.
If you all are working on something like that, I'd definitely keep an eye out for it!

Ministers of finance are usually tasked with managing government finances, guiding economic policy and overseeing financial regulations. Spotting the potential of fringe technologies that aren't practically ready to run a national economy just yet isn't really part of the portfolio, especially the portfolio with a debt/austerity-riddled economy like Greece.

I'm currently trying to figure out multisig transactions, as done through Coinkite.
My question, is there any way to provide a P2PKH public key from an existing wallet (e.g. mycelium or blockchain.info) with a signed message as proof of ownership when doing these sorts of transactions. Right now, they request a BIP32 xpub.
The reason behind this question is, I'm trying to find a way to do multisig through my existing ways of handling private keys, and I'd like to not have to manually generate and manage (including signing) keys through a separate BIP32 key generator.
Note: would a TREZOR help in any way with what I'm trying to accomplish?

I had very high expectations based on [Torsten's talk here]( a while back. The expectation was that this would be a film to bring more balance to public discussion and move away from the political and ideological arguments that have been the focus in Bitcoin's earlier days and have been previously covered. Instead the film swings right back squarely into that camp.

The funny thing is, I saw Eric Lombrozo talking at Breaking Bitcoin saying they _are_ working on a blocksize increase option.

It's not so much the price of an individual BTC but rather the value of the entire system. If a mass of people find need in a system like Bitcoin, then they transfer wealth (that belief) into that system and the value of the entire system grows. Money is after all, just a fiction we create (see [Yuval Noah Hariri's works]( 
Aside from basic trust, if we are also able to find new utility in such a system with tech that allows previously impossible things, then that also adds value to the system (through market demand forces).
The system is currently valued at $80B which resolves to a price of ~$4,800/BTC _as a result._
Current values we've placed on things:
* Apple: $815B
* Gold: $7,800B
* Narrow money: $28,600B
Bitcoin is currently at $80B. It is **10%** of a consumer electronics company (Apple), **1%** of the incumbent non-national store of value (Gold), and **0.28%** the most basic consideration of money we have in the world (Narrow Money).
By this metric, even if Bitcoin grows to meet Apple's valuation it will have to grow by 10x and would thus have a resulting price of ~$50,000. And many would agree that the relative global utility we'll see from Bitcoin is probably much more than what we get from a company like Apple. That's how you justify _the possibility_ of much higher prices than we see today.

From [their website](
**What is Start-Up Chile?**
*Start-Up Chile is a Chilean Government run program and executed by Corfo, that attracts early stage, high-potential entrepreneurs to bootstrap their startups in Chile, using it as a platform to go global. The goal of the program is to position Chile as the leading innovation and entrepreneurial hub of Latin America. This is a mission shared by the Government of Chile and the Ministry of Economy.*
I believe its funding also comes from those three Ministries in my earlier comment: Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
That board is simply an advisory board as far as I can tell, and the companies don't sponsor so much as provide strategic support in executing the program (all based on what I remember from reading about it over the years). This makes sense if you read into their stated goal of "transforming the Chilean entrepreneurial ecosystem by bringing the best and brightest entrepreneurs from all around the globe and inserting them into the local ecosystem."
Also, we don't even know if this is the competition they won. It's just speculation at this point as I haven't been able to find that info anywhere yet.

Governments don't only gain value by 'owning' stuff. I still see this as skin in the game because a deliberate decision would have had to been made by persons acting on behalf of the government to award the $40k prize to SurBTC. Their 'skin' would be justifiable use of public funds, their reputation stake that comes from supporting a BTC initiative, and the precedent set for other BTC initiatives that might crop up in Chile. 
Also, instead of 'non-equity stake' why not instead consider it 'equity-free seed capital' in which case it is an added bonus that the gov't elected to not take equity.
**Sidenote:** The startup competition may very well be [Startup Chile]( as I know their prizes are usually in the $40k range. If that's the case, then SurBTC just got the nod through *"full support from the Chilean Government with special consideration of the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs."*
**Update:** *They won it through something called [Concurso Capital Semilla]( which roughly translates to 'Seed Capital Contest'.*

Because although it's denominated in dollars, it's still Bitcoin you're sending and receiving. It pairs the global sending properties of Bitcoin with the price stability of USD (for the avg consumer).
This means that it can do all the sending/receiving functionality that Paypal can within its walls, but unlike Paypal it can now also go outside its walls to service anyone who can hold up a QR code, NFC request or straight up Bitcoin address. If you've ever had to operate outside the US where Paypal balances aren't easily converted back to cash, this alone is pretty big. The game changer is that users no longer have to worry about btc volatility, and by extension btc as a direct currency. Think:
* ~~unit of account~~
* **medium of exchange**
* ~~store of value~~

Doesn't matter if they were human or non-human. What I'm asking is, if there was some entity that was either allowed or illegitimately gained, any sort of unusual access to the exchange to fake demand/liquidity, would this mean that under normal market circumstances the valuation of BTC couldn't have actually gotten as high as it did?
Just to be clear, the actual price doesn't matter to me tbh. As a technology BTC works whether it's at $1 or $10,000. I was just wondering about whether *actual* price action more closely followed the rest of growth indicators ([merchant adoption, wallets created, investment funding etc.](

This is some pretty brilliant work, thanks man! I've been doing the calculations myself and was trying to figure out their fee pattern. I just ended up using an extrapolation from a few items I put through their system, until I just saw this comment. How'd you find their formula?

Thanks! So it looks like a static page is necessary. I found this (what looks to be) [decent guide]( on how to set up a page on Windows. I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable doing this though for security reasons.
So as far as I can see, the Bitnodes Incentive Program has good intentions behind it, but isn't at all practical for the average user.

@_date: 2015-09-02 14:08:25
Didn't understand this at first until I ran the calcs myself. Realised that the 0.01% and -0.06% are actually the incremental discounts from the previous discount level which makes more sense now. 
This means the actual discount you can get peaks at 51% and then starts to drop again from 52% onward. I was a little confused at first, so I thought I'd just throw in this comment here in case anyone was interpreting it as I was. Good work! 
@_date: 2015-09-03 11:10:15
Nope, my original data was from the same way you did it (plot points for each discount level for a few items and compare). The formula was again from you, but tweaked to work across the entire discount level range within Excel.
I'm gonna try that Excel polynomial equation thing too. I'm getting rusty. I just realised that you could probably tell it's an e function by looking at the curve. Wonder if I can work it out by hand...
That's too bad with the blogpost. Wouldn't have minded seeing that.

It can't service these countries for Buy/Sell, but it can easily for Send/Receive [(list of available countries).]( The problem before was that if I received via Paypal in some random country I couldn't cash out to a bank. With Circle I can easily cash out Bitcoin and reuse or take to an exchange. The 'locking to USD' thing is disappointing though. I just realized that that feature is only available in the US. That's weird because things like Bitreserve's locks are available in almost every country.
To be clear though, I'd still stick with wallets like Mycelium and Airbitz personally, but this may be progress for people not into bitcoin and just looking for the payments functionality.

The third world middle class (a potentially thriving Netflix market) are most definitely not adequately banked. The hoops required to simply get a credit card are at most times ridiculous even if you earn a decent income.

I believe it's that their order book is starting to normalise. I used to clear at 28-35% at around this time last year. Since March of this year though the range I'd get through at had dropped to 18-23%, and then in the last 2 months it's come down again to 17-20%. My orders usually clear in about 4 - 7 days at the levels I choose. It's only in this past week that I've started to see another drop (max 18-19%) again.
I figure what's going to happen is, as more people find the service and they're able to weed out the bad actors more, we'll see their order book settle at a sort of fair price based on two things:
* Market premium for gift card liquidation
* Market premium for buying BTC in less accessible markets
It'll probably fluctuate a little based on seasonal trends, but I'd be happy with a final range of 12-17%.

Ah here's where things get interesting. 
There are two points where we'd have the opportunity to disagree:
* Which transactions we'd like to recognise as valid (done by miners)
* Which rules we'd like to play by (i.e. which version of the protocol we'd like to run)
**Transaction disagreement**
Once a transaction meets a base set of requirements, that transaction is considered valid and every honest miner should validate it. If there's a case where 5 out of 10 miners don't want to validate something, we get into _51% attack_ territory where they'd be going against the fundamental principles of Bitcoin. The system is setup such that the incentives to not do this far outweigh the incentives for it.
**Version disagreement**
This is probably more where you were asking about. If half of the persons disagree and we assume both groups don't want to fundamentally break Bitcoin then nothing will happen and we have a stalemate (much like we've seen with the blocksize debate). The alternative would be a hard fork which folks try to avoid as far as possible if there is not close to unanimous support for the change. The effect of a hard fork where not everyone agrees (contentious) is two  fundamentally incompatible coins moving forward, a situation no-one really wants to see. Just look at the confusion that a contentious hard fork caused with Ethereum just a few weeks back.

Wait I'm confused. How can you be a "Bitcoin wallet for x location"? Bitcoin is borderless. If you're not integrated with the local fiats then you're just a Bitcoin wallet... and afaict this one is a poor one at that if I can't control my own keys (from my trial runs so far).

It's a 1 in 50 chance that you'd hit a block per year at current prices (worth ~$7,500)... and it's pretty safe to say that even if prices go up, difficulty will probably increase with it in a pretty linear manner since mining improvements have now run smack into Moore's Law.
So that's a 1 in 50 chance at ~$7,500 per year, less electricity costs for that year ... still feeling lucky?

Thanks, great explanation! Building on this then, do you have an idea of why it's often said that 10,000 nodes is an optimal number to keep the network secure?
I ask this within the context of a quote from Andreas at his MIT talk where he said that (assuming no-one is malicious) the minimum number of nodes for a functional bitcoin network is 2, and the minimum number of participants for a functional exchange is also 2.

I wouldn't consider Circle an end-user Bitcoin company anymore. Rather, it's more becoming more a traditional financial services company with a Bitcoin-powered backend.
Theirs is a mainstream play targeting existing incumbents (Paypal etc.) which is not necessarily a bad thing. Just don't expect from them the things you would expect from a traditional Bitcoin service: open, decentralised, unregulated etc.

Had to jump through a few hoops to get my btc out as MultiBit HD doesn't support blockchain.info's ".aes.json" backups anymore, and their own [decryption tool]( is down (surprise, surprise).
* Started by downloading MultiBit Classic [from here]( and using [this tool]( to convert the .json file to a .key file since MultiBit Classic ran into some problems with the compression Blockchain.info was using which ended up corrupting imports apparently.
* Imported the .key file into MultiBit Classic, but ended up with problem that my full balance wasn't loading. 
* Had to create an unencrypted .key backup which I then opened with notepad, copied the private key I needed and imported it into Mycelium where I was finally able to sweep the balance into one of my other addresses.
* _Sidenote: New broadcasted transaction doesn't even show up on blockchain.info's block explorer now. It's there on others though._
_**Hadn't realised, but blockchain.info has really turned into quite the steaming pile.**_

That's not transaction cost, that's the fixed cost of running and securing the system which pales in comparison to the costs associated with running the current alternatives:
* massive buildings
* thousands of employees
* physical security in the form of vaults, armored vehicles etc.
* printed paper for notes
* dedicated datacenters
* etc., etc.
All that and Bitcoin still has the fundamentally superior system when it comes to security &amp; transfers.

Ah ok, thanks for the links. Hadn't realised they had such a strong anti-"bitcoin the currency" sentiment.
The services they offer are very useful though, especially for activities like hedging or easily trading various currency-pairs. I've always found solace in the fact that if they ever became distasteful as a company, that persons have very little barrier to getting their money out via the Bitcoin network. 
Of course, if they are anti-bitcoin and pro-system (as you're helping to show) then those flight channels may not stay as open as they are now, which is where I think we agree on why they're less than desirable.
_tl;dr I liked that they don't try to keep you within their walls since bitcoin withdrawals are pretty open. But apparently this may not be the case for long, especially as I've seen that companies like Circle have started to limit withdrawal via bitcoin too (and not just fiat)._

Really? I love my Trezor! I've never had any problems with it and use it fairly regularly to move around my cold storage coins. I use it both with Chrome and Mycelium with no problems so far. 
p.s. I also own a Ledger nano and keep that on my keyring for lower value transactions. When I use Mycelium, the Ledger actually becomes more of a hassle because I usually have to get out my security card as well (vs. Trezor's on-device authentication).

@_date: 2016-07-01 13:01:04
Yea, I wonder how come something like Bitcoin Core can't integrate hardware wallets for the desktop in the same way that things like Mycelium integrate them for the mobile. Sadly, I'm not nearly technical enough to understand if this is something that even makes sense to implement, but that sort of functionality would be very cool.
