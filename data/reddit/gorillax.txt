Fuck that, buy a newer, faster car every 3-4 years and live your fucking life. I'd rather drive into a concrete barrier head-on than be stuck in a 15 year old Camry for years and years.

I was being a bit facetious, but yeah, I agree with you. I drive a 600hp twin turbo monster and it's probably the best thing I've ever spent money on for my own enjoyment. But my wife sees it as a dangerous waste of money and is content to drive a white Chevy Traverse at the speed limit for the rest of her life. I didn't buy my car to treat it as an asset.

Just ate through a huuuuuge 150+btc wall at $11,800. Finally. Nice movement.

Oh sure, I go to sleep for 5 hours and you guys let it fall over $500. Way to go. Now we're right back in that stubborn $11,700 zone.

I popped it back up a little bit, you're welcome.

Having a real tough time breaking out of this $11,700-800 band.

You have a neighbor

Haha fair enough.

Day traders. Btc went from $11,700 to $11,825 like 15 times today. If you had a lot of money you could have made a decent return playing that bounce.

Nigga, you suck at math.

Gee thanks, Warren Buffet.

Most people use it to pay bills and buy goods and such.
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:26:58
Rejected hard at $11,800 again
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:34:21
Now it crossed the other direction.
