Hey dont post logic on r/bitcoin
This is a sub dedicated for schilling
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:21:19
Believes belong in a church
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:22:50
They believe that bitcoin can and will replace the dollar. Talking about delusional, they prob even believe the world is flat
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:38:02
So you cant afford a candy bar with dollars then? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 06:19:46
And you are obviously delusional to think that bitcoin can replace such systems and that by replacing it all problems would be solved
Either that or you simply want to get richer from your investment
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:53:42
The only thing bitcoin does is make some people richer and wasteing resources
God does the same thing
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:36:32
Replace the word bitcoin in your sentance with god and read that again
@_date: 2018-05-03 07:42:36
So you cant create debt with bitcoin? Wow does ir cure cancer?
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:41:28
Sure it can. How about
"Buy bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:41:17
Wait if dollar is worth nothing and bitcoin is worth everything. And you sell bitcoin for dollar. How are you rich in the end ������
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:18:05
And this wouldnt be possible with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 12:46:35
I just love subs where delusional people run arround. Like r/flatearth
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:27:18

@_date: 2018-05-09 13:33:12

@_date: 2018-06-14 03:46:41
What are you going to do when you bought at 16k and its half the price. All thats left is either sell for a huge loss or try to live in denial and pretend like its going to go over 16k again
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:07:25
Also they didnt call the cops imediatly but waited a day
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:40:18

No americans are killing themself, europeans dont have the guns to do so
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:57:32
Only ameritards use , the wrong way
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:00:00
You dont need to. Esp in austria. When youre robbed then prob on the streets at night by some teenage kids and that want to steal your phone
Because you cant get a gun so easily robbers also dont carry guns
