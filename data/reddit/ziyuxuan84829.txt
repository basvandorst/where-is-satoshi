how did they tell you ? ask you wait ? it's already 1 month passed, now they dont reply my support message, no body answer anymore.

you the first one explain what's happening on this transaction, i have send lots of information to your support website, and in-app support, no one reply like this ! they just send me you will get coin, never say what's happening ..... 
As you mentioned Changelly.com is suspended in middle of Dec, why your app still allow ppl to make exchange from str to EOS? then ppl like me, can't get eos coin, and no one can help us. and no one tell us what's happening ...... 
if Changelly.com do not open this exchange anymore, can i ask refund? you know waiting time is nightmare, i cant sleep and i have to check email everyday and check lots of times to see what's going on.....
3000 STR means lots of money for me....
