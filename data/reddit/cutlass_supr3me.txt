Somebody tell me something to calm me down!  I  have been running off a prepaid card and just today decided to drop $1k into BTC and LTC. Turns out I need a legit checking account for Coinbase, so I just signed up for a BofA checking but now must wait 5-7 days to get the new debit card, which only then can I transfer the funds to new account before I can purchase BTC. I feel like by the time I can make a BTC investment, BTC will be close to 20k!!
on a side note I use to mine BTC with a buddy and had a digital wallet with (I think) 12 or so BTC back in 2012. I wouldn't even know where to start to recover that

I'm brand new to this...what are your thoughts on investing 50/50 in BTC and LTC?  or should someone go balls deep with BTC.  I'm still trying to wrap my mind around Coinbase, Trezor Mycelium, etc.
