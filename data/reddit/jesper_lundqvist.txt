Which would you prefer? A short-lived bull run now followed by another bust or an actual bear market followed by accumulation and an extended bull run? Sooner or later, there has to be pain, that's the way financial markets work.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:27:25
Even if you're not day trading it's still in your best interests to short it until it undergoes a proper reversal. You know what they say about markets and insolvency.
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:46:39
Some nice support above 7,900, bounce could continue to 8,300 or so. Volume is not that high, so I wouldn't be surprised if it tests support again later today.
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:48:53
I didn't say you didn't make a lot of money in 2017, just that you lost a lot of money since the turn of the year. You should have cashed out in January, withdrawing crypto for bills would be the least of your worries if you'd done that.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:46:43
There needs to be a proper bear market to kill off the shitcoins and allow genuine accumulation of the future dominant coins before there can be another real bull run. Too many scam ICOs cluttering up the cryptosphere.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:47:27
That pressure will ease off eventually. At some stage, the buy and sell pressure will reach equilibrium.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:49:16
If you're worried about dumps, just invest and short it. Serious investors will be more likely to pour in the money when most of the shitcoins are extinct.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:06:18
Then you are not a hodler. People who sell high and buy back in lower are not hodlers.

In that case I hope you're good at catching knives.

I've been shorting Bitcoin for the last week. Why so sensitive? Are you scared of a potential price drop?
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:05:47
Warren Buffet's comments probably didn't have that much bearing on Bitcoin's price this week: but the point still remains that the words of successful investors carry weight that affects how people invest their money. It is therefore implausible that his words are entirely free from self-interest.
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:38:30
I don't know why people are so worried about so-called market manipulation. If it's going down just short it, just because there's a downtrend doesn't mean you can't increase your holdings.
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:38:37
And the hilarious thing is the next bull run will start when the hodlers start capitulating and selling their coins. Markets have the habit of shaking people out of their positions and knowing exactly where their psychological breaking points are.
@_date: 2018-05-16 09:58:44
The recent wedge has broken to the downside with high volume on the drops. Current channel sloping gently upwards looks like a bear flag. I would side much more with placing a short than a long at this stage with next support at 7,900.
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:35:38
What kind of dead cat bounces several times a day?
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:48:23
Lots of shorts placed after going underneath 8900. Each drop has been followed by a slight rise, but coincides with buying from shorts being closed. I'm not sure if there's any real buying pressure at the moment.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:03:35
Not specifically, volume has generally been declining for months and there's been more sell pressure than buy pressure since the price got within touching distance of 10,000.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:43:11
Hodlers have unambiguously lost money since the new year. Hodling makes no sense in a bear market. You can get more coins by buying back in lower.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:41:49
If you have to take money out of Bitcoin to pay for stuff then you are not a hodler. Either you are investing more money than you can afford to lose (rookie mistake) or you are investing every paycheque into Bitcoin, both scenarios of which would mean you've racked up considerable losses since the new year compared to if you'd stayed in fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-08 10:04:40
Not many shorts on Bitfinex over the last few days, but an increase of shorting this morning. Something to keep an eye on.
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:04:38
Past day looks like a bull flag, especially after yesterday's convincing volume. There seems to be a lot of buy pressure keeping the price aways from yesterday's lows. A rise to 7700-7750 is very plausible and would be an opportune price range to enter a short.
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:39:32
Your point is what exactly? That I should have started shorting before receiving confirmation of trend reversal?
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:34:45
My point's flown way over your head - regardless of whether or not he succeeded in devaluing Bitcoin, his intentions matter. Calling it "rat poison squared" comes across far more self-interested in warning people off investing than sincere.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:01:08
You need emotional discipline to succeed at trading. A lot of people will learn that the hard way if they sell and don't buy back in lower.
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:21:54
The market may have been different, but human psychology remains the same. There are still market cycles and all of the emotions that motivate people to buy high and sell low. Combine that with crypto markets moving much more quickly than conventional stock markets and it's clear that now is a much better time to get into crypto than the next time it goes on a bull run.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:40:57
I want to see Bitcoin find support at 7,900 or finish the day above the 50 day exponential moving average before I go medium-term long again. Can only trade with the wind, not against it.
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:37:45
At that point the analogy makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:19:11
It's not that it has to be backed one-to-one to prevent large fluctuations, just that the market has to act as if it is so. Price action is based on perceived supply-and-demand every bit as much as it is on the real thing.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:30:15
For all this article's talk of hoarding, hodling prevents you from increasing your stake because it makes you unwilling to sell because you didn't do it at the peak. If you really want to hoard, you should sell as soon as a downtrend is established and buy more coins with the same money once an uptrend is established again.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:11:24
The main reason to close a short here is to get a better entry a few hundred higher, but he's probably just a broken hodler.
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:38:05
It's a factor, but most people who weren't following Bitcoin before the dump have forgotten about it. Whereas the world cup begins in two days where Bitcoin would actually be relevant to people who don't normally follow markets.
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:04:46
In principle, banks can block your transactions or freeze your account. There is no guarantee that whatever the law is now will continue to be the law in future (we see this with hate speech laws in Western nations that otherwise grant freedom of speech). For those who are not willing to take that risk, cryptocurrencies provide an alternative way of storing and spending money.
You should be concerned about monetary policy because governments can print fiat to leverage economic planning. This causes inflation, which has the side effect of devaluing your savings in the long run. Bitcoin may be deflationary in the here and now, but it is asymptotically stable, which means governments can't inflate it by issuing more of them.
Now as to holding onto currency - yes, hodling is stupid. Holding onto your coins through thick and thin deprives the market of the liquidity it needs to converge on a stable value (as well as exposing the hodler to far bigger losses than if he had sold at a loss and then bought back in at a fraction of the price): however, hodling was a necessary first stage in Bitcoin's existence as an item of novelty. Without it, nobody would have ascribed any appreciable value to it. Now Bitcoin is in the second stage, which is speculation. Speculation cannot be bypassed in an organic proto-currency because stable price levels can't be found without it. Once again, these are very normal features of a proto-currency.
Now governments and central banks won't give up power over fiat currency, or currency in general for that matter, but that's not a fair claim to have to defend. What matters is that governments and central banks will have to make concessions to cryptocurrencies, which limits their influence over their destiny to a lower degree. The development of the internet decentralised information. Governments didn't outright give up everything to the internet free of charge (like copyrighted music), but once again,the internet became big enough that governments had to play ball. That kind of leverage is exactly what we're seeing developing now.
The end goal is that crypto will next be used in daily transactions, but the price of everyday goods with be tethered to fiat (so if Bitcoin undergoes a ~5% fluctuation upwards with respect to the local fiat, the cost of a good will decrease by ~5% in Bitcoin, leaving the equivalent fiat price the same). Once that phase is over, everyday good and services would be priced using crypto as base units. That's the long term trajectory and it's a long way off happening, but the current market cycles are absolutely necessary for this to happen.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:13:14
Even if you're bearish that's not a good prediction to make. It's plausible for it to retest 7100 if only for the purpose of reloading shorts.
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:01:52
Then why was the volume on the drop so low? There are numerous examples of pumps and dumps over the last few weeks that have had higher volume. When panic selling happens, it's normally an avalanche. Once again, you're looking at a drop happening at the same time as the news and assuming that the news was the primary cause of the drop. If anything it was probably what pushed evenly-poised price action over the edge.
@_date: 2018-06-06 10:56:12
There's one crucial thing you're forgetting, and that's that if an astrologer is wrong, they lose little but their pride, whereas a trader who gets risk-reward trades wrong stands to lose their investment. These allegedly "vague" predictions are vindicated if their traders don't go bust (and turn a profit).
But yeah, keep on hodling during a bear market while trading firms and market makers make a living trading the market. I'm sure they'll take seriously someone who thinks every risk-reward trade is a "prediction".
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:04:02
Cashing out to pay taxes is one thing, but for shopping? That's as implausible as cashing out for fathers' day presents.

Longs increasing but price not rising. That's a bad sign, perfect setup for longs to get squeezed. Even shorts closing only brought about a small bounce.
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:26:56
Longs are way higher than shorts at the moment (33k+ compared to 24k+). There's far more chance of a long squeeze at the moment and its result would be far more violent than a short squeeze at the current level.
The trend of this market is still heavily bearish. If there's a pump, traders will reload their shorts and get ready to have a third stab at $5.8k support. The odds are overwhelmingly stacked towards further drops.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:07:23
I'd say market cycle, it's still considerably above its logarithmic trendline. If Bitcoin doesn't work, some other form of blockchain-based technology will replace it and since Bitcoin is the medium of exchange on many major crypto-exchanges Bitcoin couldn't go into serious crisis mode in the next few years without taking the whole market down with it. I'd say Bitcoin would only be in real trouble if a viable competitor began to outperform it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:27:56
I don't think catching a falling knife is a good idea with Bitcoin dangerously close to a long squeeze.
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:10:49
That's a convincing break downwards on the higest volume seen in quite a while. Definitely time to short the bounce.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:20:48
Bulls defending support stubbornly so bears let them have their pump so they can reload their shorts at a higher price. Pump volume is anaemic when bears reserve their volume for dumps.
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:06:30
Likely means at least 50%. Enough to justify a wager. Not the same as a prediction. Unless you think all bets are predictions?
"i am well aware that TA has been around for a long time. so has astrology. that doesn't mean that either one if them is not nonsense."
Results speak for themselves. A day trader who understands technical analysis can make a consistent profit out of it, an astrologer has no such power. Do you really have trouble distinguishing between the two?
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:43:29
I can't find a link, but it looks something like [this](
I think a certain period at the start of Bitcoin has to be disregarded because logarithmic functions become singular as they approach the origin. This introduces a large error in the slope of the logarithmic trendline. I think any logarithmic trendline from mid-2011 onwards is reliable.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:28:34
It's evident that you know very little about probability because you think that these are predictions. You can't predict the outcome a weighted coin but you can bet on the weighted side.
What you don't understand is that technical analysis is not unique to crypto. It's used in all the conventional stock markets and has been for generations. But sure, I'll take your word for it that crypto prices can break the laws of causality.
"you mean "bitcoin", the currency, not "Bitcoin", the protocol."

If the average poster here just shorted the bear markets, they wouldn't need to be so emotionally invested in seeing the price of Bitcoin rise. By the time this downtrend reaches the bottom, anyone could have doubled the amount of Bitcoin they own.

Because they can't disrupt the blockchain, prevent other people's transactions from going through or identify who you are (or at least after Scnorr signatures). Your conflating wealth inequality with centralisation, they are not the same thing.
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:07:09
I think you're suffering from a case of confirmation bias. If the market were concerned about it, the drop would have been considerably larger. The volume on the drop wasn't even especially high for a typical trading day recently.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:48:41
Most people aren't even aware that they're trading Tether, they just see a BTC/USD pairing and leave the liquidity as an an underlying mechanism they don't need to know about. The principle value of Tether is that when you trade Bitcoin against it as a proxy for fiat, no actual buy or sell orders are lodged in fiat, so its invisible to a fiat orderbook. As long as traders are unaware of willfully ignorant, they act as if Tether is backed one-to-one.
There's no point in changing Tether to another constant value if its price is not going to fluctuate noticeably. Setting it to the same as the dollar is convenient because it makes dollars and Tether interchangeable pricewise.
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:42:19
I wouldn't say that something which succesfully demonstrated a proof of concept of a decentralised ledger system (blockchain) is something that has "no real use". The fundamentals of Bitcoin are still sound and it is by far the most decentralised coin and least likely to fall to a 51% node attack. Unless some other cryptocurrency surpasses it, there will be people waiting until there is blood on the streets before buying (and by that I mean when even the hodlers are selling). And it would be astonishing if people weren't holding Bitcoin sheerly for speculative purposes, that's pretty much how proto-currencies developed before governments.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:03:03
It's not real buying pressure, though. Once the price pumps up, those guys are just going to reload their shorts and the whole cycle starts again.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:13:35
Now that's a proper Doritos graph.
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:20:46
4 hour looks too volatile to be a bear flag, it doesn't have the consistent drop-off in volume that you see in consolidation. I think it'll still break down in a few days because there are a lot of sell orders waiting around 7000.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:28:36
That's why I didn't say all. Leveraged trading exchanges like Bitmex and Poloniex don't take fiat deposits (and Bitmex only accepts Bitcoin deposits). You are right that tether is used as an intermediary to provide liquidity and avoid orders being placed in fiat, but it gives far more liquidity to Bitcoin than any other crypto.
Bottom line is until a viable crypto that is not a stable-coin decouples its price from Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be the de-facto standard.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:00:19
Why do you care what I do with my money? These threads are full of people saying buy the dip and I don't see you going after them. Are you going to be consistent about this?
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:25:00
Last nights's pump has OK volume, but still way less than the volume of recent dumps. It seems to be people closing their shorts more than anything else.
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:48:17
It means that if you bet a downwards channel exits its trendlines upwards, you'd be right on average 6 times out of 10. Of course, if you knew anything about probability you'd know that you only have to be right 5 times out of 10 to break even (assuming symmetrical trades for the sake of simplicity).
Why so hostile towards technical analysis? If you're afraid your Bitcoin will lose value in the current market cycle, just short it. Nobody will judge you.
@_date: 2018-06-05 10:03:09
Descending channel forming over the last day and a half. Likely more downward movement to go, though these tend to eventually break upwards.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:57:05
Better buckle up, because it's going to be a bumpy ride down from here. It's a shorter's market for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:26:42
If you don't cut your losses, you're only going to get more and more stressed. If you sell now, you can buy back in lower and get more coins than you have now.

I'm sorry, this is the short version of a long post.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:01:44
Well you seem to be pretty sensitive about me mentioning shorting, as this is not the first time you've lashed out at me like this. You sound like a hodler who doesn't want to cash out on a loss but pretends to have sold higher to save face. Otherwise why so hostile to shorts?
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:56:04
Look at the shorts chart for Bitfinex. It's nowhere near the level of shorts that were being placed before the squeeze in April.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:46:08
I don't care what other people on Reddit do. If I wanted people to short with me I would've gone onto Discord.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:13:21
I think 5700-5800 is a more significant support, there'll probably be a strong bounce there. If it breaks, 2000-3000 would still be an excessive drop.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:28:23
Shorts actually dropped today. There's a long way to go before shorts get at risk of being squeezed.

They chose to store their coins on an exchange rather than their own private wallet. They're naive if they didn't know that was the risk they were taking.
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:50:33
The price broke underneath the lower edge of a triangle it had been oscillating in for the last six months. Once that happened, the bots started selling like crazy. There's very little chance of it breaking above 7100 and staying there in the near future because there's going to be tons of short orders waiting for the retest.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:02:46
Markets respond to this stuff before it hits the news. In fact, the people who watch the news are the last to find out about it.
Bullish in the long term is sensible. Bitcoin will bearish in the immediate future regardless of this news.
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:49:14
Blockchain has everything to do with the value of Bitcoin because its successful operation enables transaction ledgers without a third party to enforce trust. Other cryptos do not do this as effectively right now because they are all more centralised, which provides a de-facto third party to the ledger (even if their role is generally hands-off) and Bitcoin has by far the most tried-and-tested blockchain against malicious nodes. Both of these facts make other cryptocurrencies a riskier proposition, both against hackers and co-option by the developers, and a successor to Bitcoin will have to overcome both of these points.
Once again, your argument against Bitcoin as a viable currency rests on things that are typical features of a proto-currency. Bubbles are a necessary consequence of organic interest in something as a store of value. Its use case a means of exchange is limited by the opportunity cost of spending Bitcoin. You don't get to skip those stages of formation of a currency, unless its heavily centralised.
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:30:31
It can't be blocked by your bank, your key can't be frozen, it can't be manipulated by monetary policy, etc. etc. Why are you even here if you aren't at least aware of the concerns with fiat and banking systems that cryptocurrencies try to address?

They're very stubborn if they're insisting on selling at a profit. If they're serious about getting their money back, they should cut their losses and buy back in lower after the current bearish trend has played itself out.
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:37:47
I'll keep this post short, but I think that the time we can see into the future is short and the profits to be made on the bounce are short, so our thinking should be short term and our trades short range. So I hope your woes are short-lived.

@_date: 2018-07-04 13:31:56
Massive sell wall in the 6650-6800 territory. Interesting to note that a ton of shorts opened after the pump then closed immediately and simultaneously a lot of longs closing. Will most likely need to go down and retest if it's to reach 7000.
