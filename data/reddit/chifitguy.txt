No but a data breach from a bitcoin clearing house would. Bitcoin has no consumer protection and will never get mass adoption.

Credit card users lost 0.00 if it had been Bitcoin they would have lost everything. How's Bitcoin better?

A data breach (which is the broader subject here) on any server containing wallet passcodes would result in a total loss by the consumer vs 0 loss using cc. Bitcoin does not provide any protection against loss or theft.

Lol, your gross lack of knowledge of trading is why I keep growing my account. Keep up the good work Einstein.

The author doesn't mention the the benefit of cc use by the consumer is that they have a 30 day float on their money and the option of paying the bill in full or over time. I use cc for almost every purchase. I accumulate points and have 0% interest options. Until you can provide the consumer with the same conviences, they will not move to a different payment platform.

I don't see where btc dropped like a rock in your chart.
@_date: 2014-12-26 16:34:40
Bitcoin will never,ever receive mass adaption. It's inconvience combined with no underlying value make it more of a curiosity. As with any speculation, never put in more than you can afford to lose.

If that time ever comes I will liquidate the position. But you keep putting your money into it and I'll keep taking it out. Looking at the charts the next stop is 278 then 12. The first rule of trading is never work off emotion.

I did moron. Keep up the good work. See you at 110!

BTC opened above $450 today, at this moment it is at $385.72. The volatility alone precludes it from any mass adoption.
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:53:24
And your mouth will be where all the "planes" land.

Not buying bitcoins at $300 is like".......not throwing your money down the toilet.
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:29:14
Buy it, let us know how it goes.

Bitcoin and quicksand, both very stable.

Have you been to Area 51?

It'll be hitting $10 by the end of 2015. Humans will have colonized Mars before BTC gets serious.

They are not competitors because people are using Apple pay not bitcoin.

If it were a million dollars per btc, it would be like a small country. If it were a billion dollars per btc it would be like the world's economy, if it were a zillion dollars per btc you could buy a planet.

What happens to their jaws when the value of their payment drops by 20% overnight? That 2.75% PayPal fee doesn't look so bad.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:38:54
Because it has no real underlying value.
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:12:43
You can pay/barter with anything that the other party perceives to have value. A Rolex is not money but if I go to a restaurant and offer it in lieu of money for my meal they would take it.

With wheat, oil, etc there is a demand. There is no demand for bitcoin. It is a novelty traded by enthusiasts. It has no value. You can cut production by 99% and it will still have no value beyond the small pool of users.
@_date: 2015-02-27 00:32:54
I'm betting it will be worth nothing. Been shorting it since it ran up to its high.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:56:31
He doesn't see the light. BTC will never be on Nasdaq, he's making fun.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:19:40
First, you have to get people to use it. Until then, your point is moot.

Supposedly you can anything with bitcoin, too bad no one ever does.
