You mister haven't yet fully understood what bitcoin really is deep down. The value of bitcoins comes not from the money itself, but its intrisic value comes from the fact that, unlike ANY other fiat, you can transfer it. You'll tell me that you can pay also with notes and coins. Yes it's true, and bitcoin really is a lot like that. But the BIG HUGE difference is that you are physically limites with fiat, meaning you have to give the money hand to hand to the other person.
Today if you want to transfer money over a distance you HAVE TO use banks wiring system. So you depend on a bank to accept your transactions.
But we don't trust banks ! They have been unreliable, untrustworthy and steal money. Plus they can cancel your account anytime (they did it with Wikileaks, they stop accepting money for wikileaks and froze their accounts with no reason !).
So for the first time in human history you can send/receive money over long distance without ANY KIND OF INTERMEDIARIES. And your money is more secure than it has ever been with banks (how easy it is to steal a credit card ? Or even buy credit cards numbers on the darknet ?).
So it allows you to become independant from the banks, and bigger than that, from any government. It is true decentralization. That's where the intrinsic value of Bitcoin comes from. Plus the fact that there will only be 21 000 000 BTC EVER, and you know, basic supply and demand, makes it prices go up, as more people hear about it more people want it. It could have been a bubble, had it not have this intrinsic value I was talking about before.
I strongly suggest you to read this:
You will truly understand why Bitcoin is a solution, to what problem.
Have a nice day.
