My guess is that the price will recover quickly. Indeed, I expect the auction price to be above the market price since it is a unique opportunity for a buyer to buy such a volume without directly increasing the price with the buys.
Btw: here you can predict on the auction price:

I think this two numbers are telling the BFL story pretty well: 
They products will make people lose money with 99% but they will stay in business with 90%...

I don't think so - the dip already happened when the auction was announced. And user are confident that it will have a decent price:

user here are enthusiastic as well:  50% for a price &gt;$600 seems optimistic given the current price of $567:

could you explain?
The concept of this site is that always user bet against each other - thus the site always wins since they talk a 2% fee from the winner - but I guess that is not what you mean with "scam"?

come one: 500 by tomorrow - just placed 50000 Bits :)

again: BFL in two numbers: They stay in business &gt;90%, their products make customers profit: &lt;1%...

I agree - it is important to inform people. I really made bad experience with BFL - this is why I did this post: 
I think it is informative to reduce opinions to pure numbers where people are willing to put money one - that is the principle of a prediction market. Now everyone can see that no one believes the monarch will make any profit. (Even if its offered 100:1). Maybe we should do a similar thing for KnC. They accept new predictions here and are very open towards such events from my experience:

ouch - just placed 100mBTC on "no" 4 days ago: 
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:49:24
The prediction market says 90% no as well:

this is not the same because in his example the bet is in $. If you beliefe the price of Bitcoin goes up you should directly buy Bitcoin instead of betting $ on it to win $. In this case the bet is in Bitcoin and that makes the difference.

word! 
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:18:28
haha, yes that is a cool example as well

To me it is still most likely that the coins will be sold at a price higher than the market price and that the market price will adapt afterwards. Compare:

because you can not buy 3000 coins at once without pushing the price
