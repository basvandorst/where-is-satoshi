Thinking in black and white is a stupid way to analyze economies. "Every bubble is caused by the FED" is just a lazy way out of actually studying causes of bubbles. Real studies on the 2007 housing bubble do not show the Federal Reserve as the cause of the bubble, and put more blame on irresponsible lending standards as well as a flood of capital into the United States from Asia and other countries seeking real estate backed financial assets. 
Sure you could definitely make the case that the Federal Reserves interest rate policy at the time of the housing bubble made things worse instead of better, but this is not nearly the same thing as "the Federal Reserve caused the housing bubble".

I used to be libertarian/minarchist before I got an education and actually learned about the economics I was taught to hate.
Anyways my point here is that although it is compatible with libertarianism, it is also compatible with republicanism and liberalism. No matter what your cool Mises friends tell you, the entire political spectrum in the US is capitalist. There are bound to be republicans and liberals that are both for and against BTC.
But my point that I was trying to make ealier is that when you have a bunch of uneducated libertarians running around telling you that bitcoin is a libertarian/anarcho thing, then it turns off the other 98% of the US that isn't libertarian.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:36:03
Exactly. If I can only count how many times I have said that I don't hate the Fed on and how many times people have responded by telling me that I get my economics from the news, or that I am brainwashed by the media, or that I listen to propaganda, or some other conspiracy theory. It really pisses me off because I like Bitcoin and people are trying to claim it as a libertarian political figure.  The bitcoin community should be welcoming of everyone, not be the disassociated angry libertarians that they appear to be on this subreddit.

Actually going by standard economics that is accepted by the majority of the world, it typically is. Now I do understand that Austrian economists have a different definition of inflation, and that is great and all, but you would have to call this Austrian inflation theory rather than just inflation.


There is more to inflation than just money supply. There is money demand. This is something that is not particularly clear to a lot of people that subscribe to the Austrian school. Inflation is measured by the exchange rate between the dollar and a basket of goods.  I suppose we could instead measure bitcoin inflation by doing the same, but instead using the dollar as proxy is sufficient.

@_date: 2014-04-14 16:32:48
Depends on what your goal is with bitcoin. Are you a long term investor or are you a short term speculator?  Do you want to use btc as a transaction platform to buy goods or do you simply hold them in a wallet. Do you want to buy altcoins or do you want to keep it solely in btc. Different for everyone I suppose.

Big banking is not going to take down itself. If you know anything about economics, you would be familiar with economies of scale. As a bank gets larger in comparison to competition, the cost of capital is reduced and therefore profits increase.  There is tendency to continue to get bigger, rather than get smaller.
The only thing that can really "take down big banking" is actions of the Federal Reserve (the action of allowing a bank to fail, or of introducing new regulations), or of other regulatory bodies.
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:07:18
Not really actually. P/E ratios are a bit lower than they have been on average over the last ten years. Just because companies are making more money and are worth more doesn't mean that the dollar is declining.

I think we probably agree with some of the fundamentals with btc, but may have some divergence on future of banking.


Yes, if cryptos become "the currency" then the banking industry will still be large, they will just use cryptos as the lending medium. For instance banks operate with all different types of fiat currency, it isn't really the label of currency that makes the banking industry valuable, it is the act of lending whatever the preferred currency is.

So because there are certain regulations in place to be able to rate mortgage debt, it is the regulations fault that the quality of rating was inferior rather than the firms fault?  
I am not sure if I am capturing your point correctly, so feel free to tell me if I got it wrong.
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:19:40
Its not inferior at all. As a seller I would prefer bitcoin to any other medium, because once I receive payment there will be no way to reverse it. Charge backs don't exist.  And you don't have to hold bitcoin once you get it, you can immediately turn it into a cash transfer to your bank account.

Yet housing bubbles were global, even in countries without low interest rate environments. Also read the end of my comment again.

@_date: 2014-04-17 16:02:58
Well I don't think we agree with the fundamentals. The executive branch rarely "assaults citizens".  The DEA typically is arresting drug dealers and such, not really just assaulting innocent people.  I guess I really just don't know what you are talking about.
Most of the unjust violence tends to happen on the local/state level.  For instance the homeless man that was shot and killed by Arizona police because he was camping in the wrong spot. Or one of the producers of Tosh.o that was shot by LAPD.
In my opinion the problem is not at all the federal government.  But I am sure there are cases here and there where the feds unjustly escalate things.
I guess I don't have the same worldview that views everything in black and white, good/evil, type of thing.
@_date: 2014-04-11 21:07:05


Maybe you are confused. Taxation is not giving, it is not charity, and it is not optional.  Why you are comparing taxation to charity is simply beyond me. 
And net charitable donations are nowhere near the amount of revenue that taxes get. And it would be absurd to think they would match the tax revenues if we decided to abolish taxes and instead change to charity only.

Just like many other economists, Krugman has spectacular analysis in certain areas, and falls short in other areas. I think technology is an area that Krugman doesn't grasp as well as he thinks that he does.  And if Krugman has a character flaw, it would definitely be that he thinks too highly of his own opinion.
That being said, for most economics over the past 6 years, he has been fairly accurate.

I don't give a shit about your Austrian "sound money" pitch. The dollar has high demand, that is "sound" to me.  Dollars are the central currency of the world, but somehow they are unsound because shadowstats some random website that doesn't publish methods says so... I honestly don't care for your sales pitch.

[Modest Deficits](
And it seems like you keep trying to wiggle out of the original argument by going on and on... The simple fact is that inflation is not solely caused by government trying to finance deficit spending.  Any legitimate economist will agree with that.

There is no great "cause".
Here are some causes:
* Increased savings rate globally caused excess cash in global banks (particularly Asian banks).  This caused an increase in demand for fixed income securities, and therefore a large increase in demand for residential mortgage securities.  Increased demand caused a flight to lower quality assets.
* US commercial banks were able to start competing in the securities industry post 2000's. 
* Mortgage originators that had incentive to sign people up for risky mortgages because they are the most commission
* Banks and financial institutions not caring about loan quality because they no longer would hold loans on book, and would package and securitize them and the credit risk would be the investors not the banks.
* The push for adjustable rate mortgages 
* Lack of ability of the Fed to regulate the shadow banking industry and the securities markets
* Securities rating agencies having the incentive to over rate securities
The list really goes on and on.  You could certainly say that the Federal Reserves low rates in the mid 2000's might have made the problem worse rather than better, but saying it caused the problem is a sign of severe ignorance on the topic.

You must have misread what I wrote because I was trying to do no such thing.
Bitcoin isn't exactly "economics".  Sure you can study the economics of Bitcoin, but when one refers to economics they aren't referring to bitcoin.
It is entirely possible to get rid of the annoying anarcho-libertarians that think that they are going to create a bitcoin utopia and run around happily posting memes about the federal reserve and evil democrats.
Bitcoin does not need to exist in an anarchist paradigm. In fact it is doing quite well outside of anarchy (present day).
Bitcoin is not and should not be seen as a political system. It is a form of secure payment. Tying politics into it is stupid and turns off a lot of people.

This is nowhere near true. For instance in the late 70's early 80's inflation was not because of monetary expansion, it was because of supply shock.  
I really think this view is hilarious. Essentially it is equal to saying "there is only *supply* in the money equation, no such thing as demand".  Of course if you know anything about monetary economics you would know full well that both supply and demand work in conjunction to set prices.

I don't know what other users are arguing, but I personally would say that central banks aren't competing with commercial banks.
Maybe your opinion is that the 7,000 or so banks that are members of the Federal Reserve have created a cartel called the Federal Reserve?  I would think the membership is way too large and diverse in goals to be considered a cartel. I mean consider the vastly different goals between community banks, regional banks, and national banks. Some of those banks prefer high rates, some low rates. Some prefer high reserve levels, some low reserve levels.  
Maybe if you could tell more about your cartel ideas in specific then it could help me to understand.

uh ok.. do you want me to refer you to a textbook too?


The creation of credit and transfer of the created funds to another bank, creates the need for the 'net-lender' bank to borrow to cover short term withdrawal (by depositors) requirements. This results from the fact that the initially created funds have been transferred to another bank. If there was (conceptually) only one commercial bank then all the new credit (money) created would be redeposited in that bank (or held as physical cash outside it) and the requirement for interbank lending for this purpose would reduce. (In a fractional reserve banking model it would still be required to address the issue of a 'run' on the bank concerned).


Interbank loans are important for a well-functioning and efficient banking system. Since banks are subject to regulations such as reserve requirements, they may face liquidity shortages at the end of the day. The interbank market allows banks to smooth through such temporary liquidity shortages and reduce 'funding liquidity risk'.

Sounds like the perfect account to be flagged as a possible money launderer. Not saying that you are, just saying that there are protocols that BitStamp has to follow or else they will be violating law. I am not sure the exact specifics for Euro laws, but in the US you are required to file reports for a certain criteria of activity (regardless of whether you think it is suspicious or not) and you are under a gag order that makes it so you cannot tell anyone you filed the report... even if a court orders it, you have to still get permission from finCEN first. I would imagine the laws that BitStamp follows are similar.

Bitcoin has virtually no risk to the economy. Seriously the market cap is $12.4 billion, and that is probably overstating the value of btc because there is a large amount in lost wallets. Add in the consideration that the $12.4 billion number is not exclusive to the US and is globally dispersed, and you will quickly find that if btc went to $0 it would have little to no ripple in economic activity.

Yes but FinCEN is regulation of money laundering and fraud, not securities regulations and rules.

Not that the exchanges would have to hold a certain amount in reserve or similar regulations.

What someone *thinks* is irrelevant. I deal in facts. Thoughts aren't particularly persuading to me.
And in 2013 the federal budget spent 25% on health, 25% on pensions, 24% on defense, 12% on welfare, and 15% other. [Source here](  I would definitely consider the 62% of the budget spent on health, pensions, and welfare a direct transfer from the government to those who need it.  Of course this help isn't exclusively for the poor, but is also applied to Americans across the board (Medicare for example).
I would ideally like the spending to be much more on the poor. Defense budget needs to be prioritized and wars pulled out of.  But I don't think spending more money on the poor would be something we agree on.


I am talking about federal, states are irrelevant to this particular discussion.  Too much variance.


That is some random article, not a **peer reviewed** study. Which essentially is all that really matters in economics and politics (well at least for the non-layman).




I would like to see what you read in your text, I am an econ student myself (have an undergrad in econ, and in my PHD right now).  I got to a school that teaches heterodox economics, so often times we laugh at the mainstream models in the primary texts, but nevertheless it would be interesting to know what you dig up.  I am much more fond of academic papers that have been peer reviewed than neoclassical models though.

Your factcheck.org really doesn't say anything against what I said, so I don't know what the hell you are talking about bud.


Slow down there turbo. First the Board is part of the FOMC... Second, the A, B, &amp; C members are all elected by member banks who each have an equal vote. Just because elected officials tend to come from bigger banks doesn't mean that the big banks somehow have more voting rights when electing the ABC's.
And in fact, there are 3 members of class A.  One elected by the large banks, one elected by the medium sized banks, and one elected by the small banks.
So your point is that the big banks have more voting power, but they in fact do not. If you are arguing that they have more sway because lots of governors are past employees, then that is a completely different argument. Which are you trying to argue??


Sorry I did put that down wrong. It is 7 members from the board, the president of the NY Fed who is permanently a voting member, and one year term rotation of the remaining 4 seats between presidents of branches.  Sorry for the mistake on that one.


In no way did the factcheck article go against what I have said. Please provide exact quotes of what I said and what factcheck said that are contradictory.

Whoever holds their assets in cash under a mattress for 50 years is extremely stupid. I mean a basic savings account would have mitigated most of the inflation in that time, but you are right there would still be some loss in real value of money over 50 years. 
If you would have invested in the safest and most liquid income producing asset in the world, treasuries (which is what all institutional players do) you would be well above inflation.
So all in all, your *stealing 64% of everyone's money over 50 years* is a bit stupid. I mean honestly who the hell holds their net worth under their mattress?  I don't know anyone that does, but maybe I am in touch with more sophisticated folks? I don't know...

However, that is not what the quote you wrote says. It says 


The Federal Reserve was not "supporting deficit spending" in the 70's and 80's.  There is a good case to be made that the Fed did not act aggressively enough until Volcker got in, but Rand's quote really doesn't apply here.
I mean for fuck's sake, Federal Funds were raised to 12.5% briefly in the 70's to combat quickly growing money supply.  And to think that the Federal Reserve even has control of the money supply is also so detached from reality it is amazing. Banks have way more to do with the expansion and creation of money than the Federal Reserve does, and this should be quite obvious given today's circumstances of high dollar reserve accounts held at the Fed for the banks.

You connect to a peer or a node. That node is connected to a group of other nodes. You send a transaction and announce it to all nodes you are connected to. When those nodes get your signal they pass it on to the nodes they are connected to.  Eventually a block is found by a miner (the miner is a node itself too) and hopefully by that time the transaction has been seen by the miner and was added to the block.
At least how I understand it.

Looks like BitStamp goes by [UK AML policy](
5. Reporting suspicious activity 
Minimum requirements 
You must carry out the following: 
* staff must raise an internal report where they know or suspect, or have 
reason to believe, that another person is engaged in money laundering, 
or that terrorist property exists 
* the business’s nominated officer must consider all internal reports - the 
officer **must make a report to the National Crime Agency as soon as it’s 
feasible to do so**, even if no transaction takes place, if the officer 
considers that there's knowledge, suspicion, or reasonable belief that 
another person is engaged in money laundering, or financing terrorism 
* **the business must seek consent from the National Crime Agency before 
proceeding with a suspicious transaction** or entering into arrangements if 
it’s to provide itself with a defence to a charge of money laundering 
* **it’s a criminal offence for anyone to do or say anything that 'tips off' 
another person that a disclosure has been made** where the tip-off is 
likely to prejudice any investigation that might take place 
Guidance for what to consider suspicious:
Regular and existing customers 
These are some of the questions to consider to help inform your risk profile 
in relation to your regular and existing customers: 
* the transaction is different from the normal business of the customer 
* the size and frequency of the transaction is different from the 
customer’s normal pattern 
* the pattern has changed since the business relationship was 
established 
* there has been a significant or unexpected improvement in the 
customer’s financial position 
* the customer can't give a proper explanation of where money came 
from 
Transactions 
These are some of the questions to consider to help inform your risk profile 
in relation to the transactions you carry out: 
* a third party, apparently unconnected with the customer, bears the 
costs, or otherwise pays the transaction costs 
* an unusually big cash or foreign currency transaction 
* the customer won’t disclose the source of the funds 
* unusual involvement of third parties, or large payments from private 
funds, particularly where the customer appears to have a low income 
* unusual source of funds 
Honestly, my best guess is that you are waiting for regulatory approval.

Thats alright, I am 3/4's of the way through the [Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (PDF)](  And of course have studied the financial crisis via academic papers written on it.

What the fuck are you talking about we experienced deflation as result of the financial crisis.... if we had inflation the price of houses would have gone up (went down), the price of oil and energy would have gone up (went down), the price of stocks would have gone up (went down), exports would have increased because of cheaper dollar (exports decreased).  The dollar strengthened, which is what prompted the Federal Reserve to launch QE - which by the way puts us around 2% annual inflation since 2010.
Also taxes did not increase in 2008-2012, in fact there were many tax rebates that made people pay less in taxes. The bailouts were financed via deficit of course, not through increased taxation.  It was not until 2013 until the Bush Tax Cuts were adjusted.
I know it is convenient to blame inflation and taxes for all of your problems, but thats the thing it is convenient, but not in any way factual. Now don't go saying that since Dec 1913 the dollar has gone down x% in value, because that wasn't what your point was claiming. It was claiming that we paid for the financial crisis via inflation and taxes, which is just not even close to true.

So lets bring this back to national debt... the government wouldn't need to borrow anymore or could you walk me through exactly why the national debt would be impacted. Other than of course that debt would go up because of increased interest rates on the debt.

Then you probably have no clue about what to like/dislike. If you are accusing Yellen of being less *helicopter* (I interpret this as aggressive with monetary expansion), it is commonly viewed and can be seen in Yellen's FOMC voting records that she is more similar but more aggressive than Bernanke.

I don't think that at all. I don't think charitable donations could ever have the same gross revenue as taxes. They are nowhere close to doing so today, and I have seen no literature that suggest a studied correlation between less tax and increased propensity to donate.

YTD bitcoin has been more inflationary than USD.  Over the long term bitcoin has been extremely deflationary. We are fairly sure than USD will stay in the 1-3% annual CPI whereas we have no idea what btc will do. I think your statement is too early to be able to know how it will turn out.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:35:09
How is that... I say you are 6 months out of date because LSAP's are at $55 billion a month right now. Also the last time purchases were at $85 billion was in December, so I guess you are almost 5 months out of date. And $80 billion was never an amount, it was $85 and then went straight to $75 billion.
So why don't you think I know what LSAPs are exactly?

Please don't assume that anyone that holds different views on the Fed or economics than you do, "needs more research".  This terribly dogmatic view does nothing but discredit those that use it.


Not true at all.  There are thousands of member banks and they all have the same voting rights.  The size of the bank has nothing to do with the amounts of votes they hold.


You are a bit confused here. The FOMC only actually have 4 of the 12 members that are appointed by member banks (and again this is from thousands of votes, not just big bank votes).  The other 8 (Board of Governors) are appointed by the President and confirmed by the senate.
Hope that helps to clear up some misunderstandings you seem to have!

Andreas says the same few buzz lines over and over. As far as I can tell he isn't all that spectacular. His book was fairly simple, although I suppose thats the crowd he plays to, the folks that are new to bitcoin that need simple explanations.

Your chart doesn't address the issue. The dollar is relatively stable year over year. Compare the dollar to bitcoin in purchasing power and you will see that the dollar is able to purchase the same basket of goods for a more consistent price than bitcoin.

Ya it really doesn't make sense. Banks take money and store it for you, promising to be able to fulfill your withdrawal requests on demand.  They don't keep all of your money in reserve to pay you with, they instead have formulas that approximate how much demand for withdrawal they will need to fulfill.
I suppose it would make just as much sense to call your pants that hold currency in the pockets a bank as well according to the sidebar.
They key difference is that banks make money by holding money by lending out a fraction of that money and making interest.  If you are holding bitcoins in 100% reserve, then it really isn't a bank by today's standards.

I wonder how much banks would really gain from this? I tend to think it doesn't really affect them much now, but maybe in the future could negatively impact because of less foreign transaction fees, less deposits, etc.
