The point is that the masses are buying anything that sounds like crypto or Blockchain in a frenzy because they heard about it on the news.  The current prices aren't based on a careful consideration of value, but rather a stampede of FOMO-motivated uninformed people, and that's what you call a bubble.

How is the Bitcoin technology better than the hundreds of other cryptocurrencies that have superior protocols?
How is 300k unconfirmed transactions and higher fees than the transactions themselves a good protocol?

If you bought any significant amount of Bitcoin in 2013, then you could sell now and be a multimillionaire.  But you're posting an AMA on Reddit about HODL, so that's clearly not the case.

Yes, fiat is dead and btc is the new currency.  who doesn't love a currency that takes days to process transactions and can change in value by huge percentages each day.

I'm so sorry that you're going to learn the hard way that this is not how the world works.
If my grandma is asking me if I should invest in something because she saw it on the news, then that's a good sign that a bubble is occurring.
Long Island Iced Tea changed their name to Long Blockchain and their stock price skyrocketed.  If that's not evidence that this is a mania of speculation that's crashing, then I don't know what is.

OK but the vast majority of sellers who accept bitcoin are just going to be converting their fiat prices into BTC using the exchange rate. Unless you're buying random knick knacks from your burning man bro, they don't really care how much work you put into your BTC, just its actual value and purchasing power.

Don't worry, is going to rob you.  Your BTC will stay in your account for years and years while you wait for the price to rise until eventually you forget about it.

If they're just holding Bitcoin, then they're not doing anything to "push humanity into the future of money", whatever that means.  Money has to be spent and received to have meaning, and if people are just holding it then they're not using it as money, they're just using it as an attempted get rich quick scheme.

Black Friday and pre Christmas sales.
Most people are HODLing even though the price is flat because they think if they don't sell then the losses aren't real.  The concept of opportunity loss (how much gains they could be getting if they put their investment money elsewhere) is abstract to them.
Then sweet sales come around and the opportunity cost is real.  Either keep your money in Bitcoin waiting around doing nothing, or withdraw some to buy something nice now.
This makes the price drop
