If your wallet keeps rebroadcasting it, this is the best way.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:51
LN is a joke.  And, its not gonna really reduce much, as it locks your btc up, and is not really even increasing throughput that much.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:53:36
We sell occasionally, sent you a message.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:43:27
I am very aware of how it works.  It is not a solution to the everyday problem for the majority of people.  Sorry if you feel differently.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:27:14
Check my post history. I mad3 a step by step guide, the blog site is in my posts
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:13:31
Yes, this happens.  The way to prevent it is for bitcoin owners to give their priv keys in their wills, or something like that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:47:59
And why is that?  It is a simple step by step.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:45:30
The btc amount is irrelevent.  It is a matter of how large your transaction size is (not amount), and the fee is determined of of that.  The more inputs and outputs, the higher the fee will be.  That is why it is good to not only not reuse addresses, but I recommend not even using the same wallets.  As you get a bunch of change addresses with little bits of btc in your wallet, your future spends end up using all those addresses... making your tx's a lot larger.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:15:59
I made a how to on how to help, although, you are sending such a small amount, fees will probably make it not worth it:
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:04:59
Sending a pm
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:17:42
Send me the transaction ID, or the address sent to, and I can help look at it for you, and maybe fix.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:09
10 days ago, we could send without a 100 fee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:05:25
I don't have the time or the money to create an actual site, so I used Wix to post this tutorial.  Give me some slack :)
I had a transaction stuck, that was not able to use RBF on, and I had no btc left to do a CPFP txn, so I figured this out.  It worked for me, and will work for you.
If you need help, I can do it for you, message me if needed.  I would prefer people do it themselves, as I do not want to work with your wallet unless you just absolutely cannot figure out how to do this.
If this helps, and you want to tip, the addresses are on the page.  Or, message me.  But totally not necessary.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:19:57
You have to have your seed phrase, or private key, to be able to go into the wallet foles and delete the transaction. Im not familiar with xcoins.io, if you dont control your wallet there, this wont help at all.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:13:31
It may come back eventually.  However, if nodes rebroadcast it, then itll take a really long time.  Shoot me a message, I have helped a few people get these type tx removed from wallet and resend the same output with a higher fee, and they get confirmed in the next few blocks.  You can check my post history if needed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:05:19
This is the transaction that I made to recover my btc.  I used a super high fee, but that wasnt really super necessary, I just wanted to see if it would work.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:30:42
You have to have control over the sending wallet for this to work, because we have to remove the unconfirmed tx from the wallet, and create an offling trans to be broadcast replacing it.  This wouldnt work.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:38
Import your wallet to electrum, and send from there with a custom fee.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:51
Send me the tx id, I have been helping people get transactions through.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:00:24
Maybe you could then slow down the blocks by adjusting the difficulty higher during slower times.  
Thinking that through just now though, that would just cause the mempool to swell faster at that point, so nevermind
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:30:38
Gonna be for the foreseeable future, the network is congested and miners are also moving over to BCH.  Add in the fact that we are having unprecedented usage.... we need bigger blocks, and LN is not the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:49:11
Check my post from last night.  I was able to manually recreate a new transaction, and get it confirmed within the hour, if interested i can help. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:19:09
Made a step by step:
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:24:14
If you do not on the wallet, they would need to do a RBF, or try to double spend the tx.  However, an exchange or a site is not going to do that... it takes a long time to do, and it is very technical, it just isnt gonna happen (the double spend, I mean).  
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:29:46
Gotta get McAfee to pump it too!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:55:24
I don't think the block reward should be changed, but maybe having a type of EDA (emergency diff adjustment), that is activated when the amt of unconfirmed tx's hits a certain point, then goes away when cleared would be a good idea possibly.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:34:14
that was smart.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:21:57
Hope it helps. It worked for me, and itll work for most other people too. If someone isnt that technical, im open to helping do it for them also. Thanks for the compliment
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:03:05
The address changes, but the old ones are still linked to your wallet, and can be reused unlimited amounts of time
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:25:08
Check my post history, I made a guide on how to do exactly this in electrum.  I have done it for a few people also, that decided it was too hard for them.

It really doesnt matter, you can use it all you want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:19:26
Send me a pm with the tx id, and we can get started.  And no, this is not a tx accelerator... this is replacing the orig tx with a new one, a forced double spend, that will confirm
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:50:33
I made a step by step, that fixed exactly this issue for me.  I did this a few days ago and it worked like a charm.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:56

LN not gonna solve this issue.  Gotta open your eyes and not be blinded by blind devotion, as OP said.
Bitcoin is awesome, but lets face it... we have issues.  And thats ok, bitcoin is in its infancy still.  But we have GOT to start coming together, compromising, and get this going in the right direction asap, before we start losing even more people.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:54:34
or more, as some nodes now rebroadcast old transactions indefinitely
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:19:00
LOL, good luck with that confirming anytime in the next 3 months.  Thats basically a zero fee.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:39:42
Send me a message, I have helped a few in this situation, you can also look in my post history.  This is an easy fix
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:01:35


Send me a PM for help.  This one has to be done using the DS method
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:18:28
I wouldnt be against doing the paper thing with ID.
Like I said, if they dont wanna do escrow, they can send the btc first and wait on a confirm.  
I run a bitcoin ATM network, and we don't give out money before we get a confirm either.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:23:34
It wont happen.  Barfings doesn't understand how LN works.  LN is NOT the solution, at all.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:53:44
As long as it was sent from a wallet you own, yes.
Personally, i sent from blickchain.info wallet, and was able to modify my wallet file, and rebroadcast a new transaction offline. 
It worked. Check the post i made last night. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:32:12
That is now confirmed
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:06:25
Thats a 221 sat/b....the transactions that are confirming at the moment are 990 sat/b and up. Thats a small.fee at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:16:25
Your transaction was only for about 19.00 dollars (minus fees), right?
When I do this, we have to resubmit with the correct fee that is currently being accepted on the network, unfortunately, that would be the majority of what you sent.  I would recommend waiting it out, in your case.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:58:29
It depends how long your transaction stays in the mempool. Also depends on if your wallet auto rebroadcasts it.
If you check my history, i was able to create a forced double spend to fix this issue myslef a few days ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:46:35
I put it into our mining pool, and asked them to prioritize it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:17:43
I like bittrex, but they closed new registrants I think
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:56:03
Coinomi is a great one
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:01
It will.work with any wallet that you control the priv keys to, because you have to go into a backup copy of the wallet, and remove the unconfirmed transaction, and then go offline and manually create a new trans using the same output,  and broadcast to a new node in the mempool that no longer knows your old tx existed. 
Tldr: yes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:57:45
Messaged you
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:57:00

If you own the wallet that you sent from, and it is NOT from an exchange, or a company, PM me, I can help.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:21
1.  Nothing.  So, meet in a public place, sit down and have coffee or something.  
2.  If you use the escrow, then you will not need to wait for a confirmation.  He can release the coins to you, on the site, and they will be in your wallet.  I would always use the escrow.  There really is no reason not to.  
If you do NOT use the escrow, then have him send the btc to you while meeting, and only give the cash after one confirmation.  If he has to wait and hang with you for a little bit, so be it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:08:02
Yes, I had to go into the the wallet file, and delete the tx, then go offline, and create a raw trans id, and push it to the network before reconnecting the wallet online.  
Also, had to allow the 36 hours for the mempool to forget the original tx in enough nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:13:48

If they have a wallet, you can send to their addres, and they will not need a coinbase.
If you are sending to an email, they will be directed to make a coinbase acct when they get that email, to collect the funds.  They can then send them to anywhere they like.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:06:56
1.  The fee included is low, its gonna be a long while likely.
2. It is 2 outputs because the sending address had a lot more btc in it.  The way bitcoin works, is the address sends the entire amount in it when you send.  The part you want to send goes to the receiving address, the rest goes back to the original wallet, using a diff address in that wallet.
Its called a change address.
It is like paying for a 5,00 bag of groceries with a 100 dollar bill.  You hand over 100, they keep 5.00, and hand you back 95.00, in different bills.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:16:36
Check my post history.  I just had to purposely double spend to get access to coins with a low fee.
You are correct in what happened.  The node that electrum was initially checking, had dropped your orig tx from the mempool.
When you sent the new tx, the nodes that do not see the 1st one will accept it and broadcast it.  The nodes that did NOT yet drop the inital tx wil sho as a double spend.
Only a few miners out there will confirm an attempted double spend... some will only take the first tx.  Mine confirmed after a few blocks.
Hang tight, that 2nd one should confirm, and then that 2nd one will be rejected and dropped from all the mempools.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:00:09

You shouldnt be charged a fee.  Well, I don't charge extra fees on my btc ATM's.  I do have a markup obviously, but mine is set at 2% above current price.  I have to make a profit obviously to pay for the 4 7k machines, and expenses.  I also buy btc at my ATM's, at 2% below current rate. Thats enough for me.
If you need a place to buy, shoot me a message, I can probably work with you on a lot better than what you are paying to the ATM near you.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:46:58
In Missouri, we purchased our ATM's (~7k each, for 2 way machines).  We also provide a small percentage to each location, in lieu of a rent fee.  We had to obtain a few licenses and such as well.... however, we are already in profit, because we are one of only 2 players in the area, and we have the majority of the market as our rates are more competitive.

Except....they did, just as you posted this.....
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:38:56
Best bit of advice I can give you here is this. 
If you have coins left in that address, which I see you do, send them ALL to another address you control, but make the fee really high too... like 5.00 dollars.  The miners will pick up that transaction, and in turn, they will pick up all the previous too, to get that fee...because to get that fee, all previousl parent spends have to be confirmed.  
Its called Child pays for parent (edited I mistyped), and it works alot faster than you waiting days or weeks for them to be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:22:15
I suppose. But theres no reason to ever give out your private key, in the first place

It is rare that this happens... but a good question.  Personally, I just go ahead and trust that it will work.  check the fee, if it is sufficient, it should go through.  I usually meet at a pub house near me, buy the guy a beer, and give it time.

Unconformed parent means that whoever sent you bitcoin, before you sent it out, sent with a low fee and it has not yet been confirmed. 
Once your transaction you received has a confirmation, yours should confirm, usually in the same block. If you sent with a high enough fee, the child pays parent principal applies...meaning, that a miner will see a high fee, and conform your transaction...and in turn, it will auto confirm the parent transaction. 
Tldr: give it time. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:40:22

Thats what I am saying.  They don't keep a ton of extra btc to swap.  I am sure they have a limited supply of btc... since they don
t make any money off transactions or using their wallet, it is simply them doing swaps for you, with their personal funds.

@_date: 2017-09-21 05:24:40
Make him a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:33:36
SO... foldapp folded?
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:18:57
I would wait til morning.  WU closes some places, hes likely telling truth
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:24:04
Thats a blockchin.info wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:37:33
Gyft has never failed me, they take btc, and paypal and credit cards.  The PP and credit card buys are not instant usually.  BTC purchases always have been, I have bought Amazon, Bsst Buy, Wal Mart, and a few food gift cards before, as recently as yesterday.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:21:00
I was on other markets previously, I am used to shipping.  Shipping internationally isnt a huge deal once you get used to it.
I currently have miners up for sale, a few brand new hardware wallets (Trezors and Ledger Nano S's) and some recreational substances.
You can get OpenBazaar and search my store.  Today I am doing everything 15% off for this special CryptoIsCurrency event
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:59:55
Cash i out as you need it maybe?  Thats probably what I would do.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:32:18
Yep.  Same exact scam.  I bought a 500 NIke, I didnt send it to him though.  I buy and sell btc, own a few ATM's.  I don't play that bullshit.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:32:25
Yes you can use TOR
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:42:10
USI is another one
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:35:53
Schnucks... you in STL too?
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:11:34
Oh, I never sent it to him.  He "forgot" to tell me that he wanted the card first, until after I bought it.  He never got the info, I am not stupid.  
I have been running a bitcoin busines since the early days, and have ATM's now.  I am pretty well versed....he isn't going to scam me.  But it is a warning to others is all.
I have his number, and texts also, so if someone did get scammed by him, message me.  Almost vcertain I know his name also:  KL is his initials, in New Hampshire.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:53:50
This user is trying to scam anyne he can, it appears. See this for details: 
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:30:04
Thank you.  Wasnt sure if RF was working again.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:26:46
Irregardless, this user is a scammer, and tries to sucker people into buying and sending him gift cards.
Hence, why he cannot use those sites, or upload ID, or anything of that nature.  
Tried that game with me, might as well start a new account or something, OP
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:57:30
Another scammer is He likes to say he has "7k in coin that is useless to him", then wants you to buy Nike gift cards and moneygrams.  I bought the card, but am not dumb enough to provide him the info, beware.  
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:44:40
Sent his info
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:51:50
It happens. Same way it happens that we find 4 blocks in 10 minutes sometimes.  Variance.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:37:54
Pax mods are terrible, and they take forever.  They have like 3 of them, expect it to take 4-5 days, honestly.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:34:00
In the future, use gyft
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:56:07
You are ok now, but in future always use a middle wallet.  Coinbase will shut you down for sending money to or from gambling sites.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:07:32
They all have limits.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:23:54
Try using electrum on your computerand phone.  You own the keys, and its a good wallet
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:12:58
We do ok, it is a large initial investment though.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:08:21
Nobody really knows.  Personally, I think we see around 2800, but again, nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:14:26
It should on the kiosk, yes
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:40:26
In the US, it takes 2-3 business days usually.  Completed just means it is being sent via ACH now.  You should see an update late this week in your bank acct.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:57:27
You are now banned from DNM
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:33:36
SO... foldapp folded?
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:34:54
I do this personally, not sure of any services other than BitWire though.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:12:11
Search works great now.  Have to go to site, download the new Open Bazaar 2.  Works like a charm.  I have a lot of listing up, and have made about 10 sales already in last few days, and first buyers have already received product.

Less chance of catching AIDS at least :)

2013 .5 - 3100.00 in btc
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:06:29
Our ATM's require ID scan anything over 50.00
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:30:01
This is same guy I busted yesterday... he made a new name:  he was He called me from his actual number.  I was able to backtrace it, and I have the info on him...his dads name, address, his phone number, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:54:56
If you had that much, I would think paying fees to split it up would be best.  No reason to risk it at once.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:08:21
Nobody really knows.  Personally, I think we see around 2800, but again, nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:34:00
In the future, use gyft
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:02:59
Yes, this is standard.  I own 4, its a requirement to operate legally.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:09:43
There was not a block for 1 hr 40 minutes just a short time ago.  Transactions are backed up a little, but we have had a few come now, so as long as they keep coming, you should get a confirm shortly.  
The EDA on BCH dropped our hashrate some, but it will confirm soon.
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:51:11
Very cool, nice job man.  You should make an open sourced list of domains you included already, so we can make recommendations on ones that are not on there that can be added
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:13:54
It is set by the ATM owner, ours are 7%
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:01:01
I own 4 in st louis, mo, we charge 6%, but we require ID, it is part of the kyc requirements.  Anyone not requiring is risking jail time.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:49:04
Click on  the menu "Wallet" then "Seed".  Write down the Seed in the exact order, and that will be how you access your private key anytime you need it.
