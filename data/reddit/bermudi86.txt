I see the joke escaped you. A tomato is not a potato, there is an actual difference.

If GA has even one ounce of self respect he wouldn't participate in such a pointless charade.

And this, people, is how politicians manage to do whatever the fuck they want. 
He called the BBC and "proved" his identity under his own conditions, controlled setting and protection of NDAs but when asked to do the same in an open manner, CSW decides the pressure is too great and back pedals.
It was a mess of his own doing and anyone who thinks otherwise is just a simple minded, easily duped, pushover. Even in a fucked up world where he actually is Satoshi, conducting himself in such a shady manner would make the guy a fucking hypocrite rendering his opinion useless. But somehow, some fucking how, people keep defending and rationalising this shit.

That's **exactly** what I did and **exactly** why I said what I said. You are accusing him of being a fuckup the last two years and produce only two opinion pieces on what happened days ago. Lame. And I'm not here to defend GA, as a matter of fact, I didn't know who he was before all this Satoshi circus started.

yeah, ill take some of that
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:18:42
Maybe because he says he is SN in the blog post? 
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:09:03


You call that proof? CSW had more solid shit than you
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:36:23
We are such assholes for demanding what Satoshi tought in the fist place!!!!!!!  /s
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:13:46
ppl like him is why cons succeed when they do. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:41:05
Potato, tomato. What's the difference?

Uh, behave yourself. This is all that is needed and has been asked for since this whole mess started.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:49:35
I heard he also makes some mean pie! 
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:46:11
And he wasn't even close except for a select few. Duping the press into publishing unverified facts it's hardly an accomplishment these days.
