Ok. We are dealing with &lt;300000 USD, but I wouldn't sell all the crypto at once to avoid paying huge taxes on it of course. I will try hard to get the poloniex records back, if that fails then head to an accountant. I will head to an accountant either way (whether I get the records back or not).
A tax attorney is similar to an accountant right?
Thanks for your replies.

I am basd in the UK unfortunately, thanks for the offer though. 
Final question (sorry!) how would you go about finding a CPA if you didn't have your background? What things should I look out for and ask? 
Thanks a lot.

Ok, so your recommendation would be to get in contact with a CPA, and not an accountant or tax attorney? I need to google what a CPA is and does haha

I'm starting to think deleting my account was a fucking stupid idea. I thought Poloniex would keep all records.
If I claim a certain amount bought and sold for (haven't sold any yet) I should be fine right? Then it is up to the HMRC (UK based) to look in to it more and correct me right?

Yes, I know roughly how much I have and how much for. I am talking hundreds of thousands.

Sorry for repyling twice, but what you're saying is if an honest estimation is given then it should be ok?

What do you think I should do if the trades are unrecoverable? I need to try harder to get at Poloniex. Should I get an accountant without the information available? I haven't actually sold any of the crypto yet so there's no sale made yet.
You seem pretty knowledgable on the subject, my thoughts are that I should get an accountant and estimate the prices if unable to be retrieved. Surely it is in the hands of HMRC (IRS equivalent for UK) to look up the actual cost if they don't want to take my word for it?
P.S I am based in UK.

That's probably a terrible idea.
