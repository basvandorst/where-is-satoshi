I just wanted to say that you're awesome!  I've been watching some of these posts just to see how far some people go to give back to the community and to get other people interested in bitcoin.  I must admit, your passion, as well as many others, is contagious! Keep up the awesome!

So the whole  bit about "there are x amount of bitcoins that will EVER exist" is truth and if these 29,655 coins are lost then that amount of bitcoins that will exist period will be x - 29,655?

I'm still quite new to btc so I have a couple questions.  If those coins get lost, or get thrown back into the market, would there be any effect on the worth of the coin?  Also, towards the beginning when I was starting to learn more about bitcoin someone told me that there are only going to be x amount of coins ever.  That there is a set amount and once that amount is mined that that is all there is going to be.  I'm not sure if that's true or not, but if it is, if these coins are lost, does that mean that the number of coins out there will be x-29,655 or do they end up getting re-mined or was the person who told me that completely wrong?

I didn't even know this existed until just now!  Took me a minute to realize that people weren't actually giving out 1 BTC.  I about went crazy thinking people were just tossing that much at people!
