I was discussing Bitcoin with a friend in a government agency, and he explained how it wasn't much of a threat.

Yes, this is the correct answer. Miners owe nothing until they cash out.

Venmo seems interesting; I had never heard of it until now, and with no fees at all (unless you pay with a credit card) - well, they could be a game-changer. Assuming that Venmo works great (which is probably does), they are still serving a different purpose than Bitcoin. Collecting rent from the roommates, for example. Massive merchant adoption seems ambitious for them, and far, far away.
I dug through their website, and found these red flags that concerned me.
Their press page only has two press release links. One announcing that their beta stage is over - that was almost 2 years ago. And the other link just doesn't work. There's been no movement for this company, who appears to have a whole lot of young, educated employees. But what are they doing? One of them wrote a press release once, but hey, that person doesn't even appear to be there still. 
And how are they planning on making money? From the interest they collect by holding the money of others? That would require them to hold a whole lot of money - especially with all those employees. I see them going broke soon, sadly, unless they can make this project explode in popularity.

Out of the major coins, Quark is the fastest, by far.
Right now, Quark's confirmation time is just under half a minute. Dogecoin comes in second, at a little over a minute. Litecoin comes in third at around two and half, and it gets worse from there. This is just out of the major coins, mind you.

No, it would not look or work the same, but an Apple payment system would function similarly for a consumer.

And that same annoying bank-and-identity-confirmation process is what you'll go through with online Bitcoin exchanges. 
I see a couple articles on them, and they appear to be growing. Only 35 reviews on the App Store, but over 1000 on Google Play? Growing at 15% a month - 7 months ago - but will they reach a critical mass of adoption? Maybe. Reviews seem positive. As long as they keep growing, their corporate parent should keep them afloat. 
But they need merchant adoption, just like Bitcoin. 
“It’s an anomaly that PayPal and others tried to make money from the consumers,” explained Bill Ready, CEO of Braintree. “We make money when merchants use us to accept payment but we don’t charge consumers for that.”

Let me give you a real life example, if that helps.
I went out to eat with a friend. We both get our separate bills in Bitcoin. He pays his. My phone can't read the barcode, so my friend offers to pay for me, and have me pay him back later (which was no problem). 
But my foolish friend sent the payment to same address as his bill, and not mine (against my protests, ugh). So our meal was over, but we couldn't leave until the owner got some confirmation of the second payment, which 15-20 minutes later still hadn't happened. But he was nice, and let us leave because he could see that it had been sent to an address he owned. 
Now, I know this is just one example, and I don't want to debate the details behind. My friend was being rash, I get that. But it's a real example of how slow confirmation times and dealing with payment structures can all intertwine into problems.

Bitcoin will never be worth $10,000. It would be amazing if it hit $2,000 again. The bubble has burst - the more people and companies use it, the more they are converting it right back to cash again. 
There is a lot of faith and momentum that got Bitcoin up to $1,200, but the slow fade back to reality will continue for the rest of the year. I see $125 Bitcoins coming before 2015 is over.

Short answer: sort of, but not really.
Think of it this way. Originally, there were just miners selling and speculators buying. Both these categories still exist, but now that there are retail outlets for Bitcoin use, people can buy them to actually use them.
Of course, a stable price would help - or at least a stable bottom.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:27:11
Other cryptos can do what Bitcoin does in this retail environment, but even better for the companies on the back-end. Transactions can still be instantaneous, for any coin - but confirmations are what we're talking about. And Bitcoin is undeniably slow in this regard.

So few people would use it, in comparison to Visa, that they wouldn't be able to justify the losses to shareholders.

I think that every type of person who uses Bitcoin is interested in actually using them like currency, rather than a trading commodity. And without that outlet, the buying would have started to dry up. New retailers make it exciting, and places like Gyft actually make it economically worthwhile. 
However, I do think that everything you've said has been right. Technically, any selling should result in a dip, and probably does here and there. But all these retailers bring so much positive publicity and reinforce the investment thesis (that Bitcoin can function like a real currency).

A wallet app would have to pass the App Store test, which means that Apple would have scrutinized it thoroughly for viruses. Allowing Bitcoin wallets would not add any more risk than any other app they already allow.
Apple has an app called Passbook, which keeps gift cards and coupons and things. It would be a highly logical next step to incorporate credit payments through Passbook, and many analysts believe that this will be one of Apple's next moves in the coming years. The infrastructure is already in place, they have the right allies in the credit card industry, and the profits from such an enterprise would be worth it for Apple. 
However, Bitcoin COULD take all that away - or at least make a huge dent in these future profits. Both systems offer a person the ability to make payments instantly through their smartphone - these concepts are entirely in opposition to each other. And at the adoption rate kids and businesses are accepting Bitcoin, it could very well take over the mobile payments industry in 10-20 years.
Would Apple risk their image and a few sales to put a stop to this trend before it catches fire? Possibly. It's not a crazy theory, but the proof is still all conjecture.

Your effort is best focused on getting a good existing charity to accept BTC. Becoming a legit nonprofit takes lots of time and effort.

You get fractional shares when you reinvest your dividends. BRK.A &amp; BRK.B have never paid dividends. There is no fractional ownership of these shares. People are just outright paying $200,000 for a share of BRK.A

Percent withdrawal fees are shockingly high, I agree. 0.2% trade fees I am fine with. That's great! .0005 btc as a flat rate for withdrawals? I can handle that. So I trade on Bter and Cryptsy.

I'm not so sure.
Just because the coins are sitting there proves nothing. 
I'd be more worried that people are donating based on a reddit post that could have been done by anyone.
There were certainly more than one, but this one had names to back it up, and the OP has stuck around to defend their cause. I'd say there is a fair chance that this is a genuine action. 
However, your core (bold) message is very spot on.

I don't think the author is saying that, or most of the things you've been replying to me. Sorry, but your answers are just confusing me more.
But serious question: are you drunk? are you high? both? 
Or is it just 4am for me, and I can't fall asleep, and my brain is drained?
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:20:32
There are a lot of people with coins locked up right now, that would probably like to sell them.
Then again, lots of people who could sell haven't.
Hard to say. Nobody can be sure.

Bter points supposedly earn you a dividend, but I've never held them long enough to get one.
There was an option to convert them to CNY - but you'd only see it when you changed the site to Chinese. And you'd lose half of them in the process. 
Or you'll just lose them all when you withdraw. Whatever, probably. 
Bter withdrawals do work consistently, and their fees are great. So it's still a good site for traders, even if it totally caters to a Chinese audience.

Except for their terrible examples of merchants and how it works for them, this story was accurate and at least ended on a positive note. That's about the best we can hope for from cable news, I'm afraid.

So people deposit LTC into Bitfinex, which is their collateral to buy BTC on leverage?

Most major American banks have added layers of fees. Many poor people pay them.
Pro tip - use a small local bank. No fees, great service.

To play Devil's Advocate, if you read the fine print you can call a number for a replacement card after this one expires. 
Still, why should the funds on this card ever expire? And how much will it cost to get a replacement card?

Just some of our mega banks. Meanwhile, our small local banks give all the same services for free. And there are free large banks too - people are just often lazy or ignorant.

Dude. Math lesson here, because YOU are confused.
$1.00 down to $0.05 is a loss of 95%, not 99.95%.
99.95% would be a $1.00 down to $.0005, or 1/20th of a cent.

Tesla is worth $23.73 billion. 
And they are worth that because of their future profit growth projections.
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:56:20
I'm being serious. 
I see no reason why anyone needs 100 ASICS. If 1 is profitable, then 100 works at the exact same scale of profitability. You make 100x less, but at 100x less risk and cost. 
This arms race concept leaves everyone as losers, imho. And it prevents fresh blood from considering adding fresh nodes.

Your company should be sending you a tax form which will show exactly how much you made, such as a W2. 
Considering that Bitcoin went down all year, I highly doubt you made much more selling them than you were paid in them throughout the year - but if you did, you'd pay capital gains tax as well your basic income tax. 
Some other factors that might help us help you more:
Which country is the company you worked for located?
Are you an employee or a contractor for them?
How much did you make in total for the year?

There are more cryptocurrencies than just Bicoin, and many of them have had ICOs that have issued coins. So they aren't insane.

how about blockchain?
(as I see coinjar has already been mentioned).
I'm not sure Apple cares. There's a PayPal App, right? They'll be the ones eating up the iBeacon money methinks.
