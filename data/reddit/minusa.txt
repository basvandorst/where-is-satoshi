Nigerian here. You give the scammers too much credit.
Needs more grammatical errors.

Meh. I'm Nigerian too. You can't deny there was a phase when email based 419 (alias Yahoo yahoo) was incredibly popular here.
Shit there was a No 1 hit about it [Olu maintain - Yahoozee](
It isn't a meme. It's the name of the scam. And it's based on a reputation built by unscrupulous Nigerians.

4 minutes earlier you just posted "I'm learning about bitcoin" and now you're offering your opinion?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:46:13
Nigerian here. Web developer. Couldn't get paid because PayPal refused to allow receiving payment over here and most remote working opportunities preferred and usually insisted on it.
I have many bank accounts (Naira, $, £ domiciliary) and yet not until Bitcoin achieved wider use was I finally able to offer my services worldwide.
So yeah. Banking is a privilege that can be overlooked by the western world. Arbitrary limitations existing in different parts of the world have been heavily undermined by bitcoin's emergence.
 You bet I'm an all in hodler. It's let me do what I love from the country I love (fuck H1Bs) for anyone I please. That impact can't be understated.
"can't open a bank account" might not necessarily be an infrastructural issue. A lot of times it's really just arbitrary policies

Fiat / ETH exchanges aren't as ubiquitous
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:21:57
You listed a bunch of American/Western European exchanges.
Most international exchanges offer only BTC.
Prospective altcoin investors would then have to make do with services like Shapeshift.

You proceed to try to create a red herring argument my implying things would change in 6 months.
While anything is possible, what does that have to do with anything right now?
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:32:23
This was where you were wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:45:13
Right. What exchange can a South African buy LTC from?
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:39:00
The quote you responded to here was demonstrable proof that your "read more" statement was misguided. More objective individuals would've taken the correction as new information and moved on.
Instead you went for a strawman argument here by trying to change the argument.
Litecoin isn't easy to 51% attack. It is, however, orders of magnitude easier to 51% attack than bitcoin. 
$15M won't buy you a shit player in the English Premier League.

Dude just take the L and move on. You're embarrassing yourself
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:45:29
Here you finally agree that you are wrong, while sounding eerily like the Narsicisst's prayer 


...in an attempt to downplay the significance of being wrong
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:47:22
At this point you're just flinging shit.
So no. There's no herd mentality here. You're just to insecure to accept being wrong without it affecting your ego
