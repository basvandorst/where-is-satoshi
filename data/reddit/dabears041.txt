Cell phones are getting cheaper and cheaper. $40 I think I heard for the minimum smart phone needed. Still a ton of money for those in extreme poverty. But hey at least it’s a plan. People talk about how these countries skipped PCs/laptops and use cell phones now since they are cheaper. I think that if there was any hope to help the unbanked this is the best one we’ve got. To open a bank account costs like a $1000 in the us? Not costs but you need to have that much $ up front.

Cash app allows you to send the btc to your friends and contacts. Otherwise it is just like an exchange. What you should do is send btc you are planning to save to a desktop wallet and keep btc you plan to spend &amp; trade on the cash app. Get a trezor or ledger when your btc savings exceed $500 is my advice.
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:42:58
Agree with everyone else. Half ring half bitcoin..I am a big supporter but this just seems a bit much. 1 btc is 1/17000000 which means you already have a nice chunk of digital space. Just my .02

Yeah, if hacked, there could be a run on the exchange and coinbase defaults on all $ and bitcoin obligations.  However coinbase is the premiere exchange in my opinion. Love them or hate them they have very deep pockets so I don’t think you’d be totally screwed. Maybe they’d pay you out over a few years time. The bottom line is that this is just a scenario and no one knows exactly how it would play out. I guess the question is do you trust your bank or coinbase more?
@_date: 2019-07-21 06:26:23
I agree that this is worth a discussion. However, it is in their interest to provide a safe &amp; secure way to store bitcoin. As soon as their security is compromised, then they lose their market. They are selling shovels during the gold rush - I don’t think they would fuck that up with a  scam. They stand far more to gain by accomplishing their mission statement.

Agreed. I work in supply chain and logistics and if all entities along the chain were speaking the same “language” in some way it would simplify things.

He’s saying that if bitcoin grows in popularity to the level of gold each btc is 400k because the market cap is 7T. That doesn’t mean gold will lose popularity at all. Bitcoin can become more popular by appealing to people who only hold stocks &amp; usd. All I’m saying is nowhere did he write that bitcoin will steal gold users, although I think it’s possible.

I trust coinbase enough to buy bitcoin through them, but keep in mind it’s expensive compared to some other options (look around it’s been asked before). I use coinbase because it’s easy, I’m lazy, and really not too concerned about fees. 
Then send the bitcoin to either
 1. A hardware wallet like Trezor or ledger nano s.
2. A downloadable wallet for your desktop.  Lots of recommendations here but I recommend the hardware wallet if you’re storing a large amount. 
Never store bitcoin on any exchange because the whole point of bitcoin is to retain full ownership. Don’t make coinbase your bank for no reason.

Idk about everyone else but I started buying May 2017 and didn’t buy or sell at the crazy highs. Which kind of hurts because I could have made some amazing gains. However, I’m still up considerably and tbh it looks like bitcoin is still in a bull market from my perspective. Yes it hit 20k and burned down to 6k, but to me that was just a crazy spec bubble in the middle of a bull market. I mean literally I when I started the price was 1.5k and now it’s 6k. It feels like we are back to normal growth and will see 8-10k in a year or so as more people come to understand the value of the network. 
What im saying is that if you zoom out we are still in a bull market. Don’t buy shit when it goes parabolic is the lesson for those that did.

@_date: 2019-08-01 14:47:54
I think mostly because the bitcoin network is the most valuable. It’s the most honest &amp; natural in terms of distribution of bitcoin (no sketchy ipo like alts), it has the highest security (competition of mining &amp; # of nodes), first mover advantage, and the ability to be improved through development. I don’t know what will happen, but people are confident because to achieve the current status of the network is already extremely difficult for competition. Any improvements and “blue ray technology” may get built on top of the existing network. The biggest take home is the network is what makes bitcoin valuable. Research and try to wrap your head around that.
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:22:10

You own a Robinhood position on bitcoin. Which means you have the right to sell your bitcoin position to someone else on the Robinhood app. The price of the position is determined the same way as any other market. People line up on both sides to buy and sell the position at what they believe is a fair price. Robinhood sits in the middle and exchanges between the parties.

Before I start, I just want to say that I am not a computer coder / cryptographer so there is someone out there that can answer these questions far better than me.  I am a normal guy that has been in bitcoin for a few years, has gained some knowledge, and is attempting to share what I learned with someone who appears to be a novice on the subject.  There are better people/resources out there than me... but here goes nothing:
I am not too familiar with the details of lightning network.  But basically you open up a lightning channel between two parties and can send immediate transactions backs and forth until you close the channel.  I believe the opening/closing of the channel occurs on the main chain.  Again not an expert and someone can probably explain that better.  But I don't understand what you are staying  - which other projects can settle immediately?  Bitcoin can't settle immediately due to the block size, volume, and security features that we already talked about - and that's why lightning network is being developed.  Also, other projects barely have any developers working on them and Bitcoin/Lightning network has the majority - so things are moving quite fast and Lightning network is already working to some degree - not for the masses obviously.
I don't know if anyone has the power to even perform a 51% attack.  It would cost tons of money and be really unsustainable from what I've heard.  Moreover, I believe the developers could learn from the attack and fork the coin or change the code in some way to isolate the hostile actor.  Also i think it is important to understand how hashing difficulty works.  If Chinese miners were seized and turned off, then the hashing difficulty would drop making it easier for remaining miners to find blocks.  This makes it so the network continues to run efficiently regardless of the volatility in computing/hashing power.
There are multiple mining pools competing for transactions.  What power would a mining pool have if they simply found 2 blocks in a row?  I would look up all of the pools and just understand that people can willing join/leave these pools.  If one pool became extremely dominant, then people may not like that and choose to move to another pool to make it more competitive.  Again, not an expert here DYOR.
Because bitcoin was first and therefore is the most proven and trusted.  Bitcoin has been attacked over the years but the protocol itself has never failed.  Exchanges get hacked, people get hacked, but bitcoin keeps chugging along without interruption.  Tether is a centralized stable coin (tied to USD) which is mainly helpful for helping traders exit positions without cashing out into fiat.  Tether could be good for transactions theoretically, but again this a centralized stable coin (inflationary too) so no one is going to trust all of their funds tied up in tether and no one wants to lose to inflation or they would just hold USD-- i also question the assertion that even outsiders trust tether over bitcoin - like who and why the hell would they feel that way?  The bitcoin standard talks a lot about how bitcoin is the hardest currency and therefore the most valuable.  Give it a read.

@_date: 2019-12-14 01:55:34
*First,  with BTC, it is my understanding that the blockchain is very  inefficient, has slow transition times, and small block sizes. Why is  this okay?*
\-it is ok because bitcoin developers prioritize security over convenience at the moment on the main chain.  Basically, there are tradeoffs with every cryptocurrency  For example, litecoin is 4x faster settling transactions but it is less secure.  The long-term thought is that 2nd layers (like lightning network) can be built on top of the main chain for expedited transactions.
*Second, with BTC, it is  my understanding that china controls over half of the BTC mining power,  and that China could essentially destroy the blockchain at any time.  Why is this wrong?*
You need to clarify what you mean by "destroy."  There are a lot of arguments against what you are talking about.  There are many ways that bitcoin has been attacked, and the most common dooms day is the 51% attack.  Look up Andreas' video on 51% attack.  Otherwise, just understand that mining bitcoin in itself is a profitable venture with incentives, so large players in the network may not be inclined to kill the goose that lays golden eggs.
*Finally, with  BTC, it is my understanding that people pool computing power together  and these groups can solve multiple blocks in a row. Why is this okay?*
Mining pools make it so people share mining rewards.  Basically instead of you mining on your own and getting a payout twice a year, you get a steady income because you engage in profit sharing with fellow miners.
Now for the Alt-coins
*First,  it is my understanding that some altcoins can process transactions much  faster, cheaper, and more securely than BTC, why is this irrelevant?*
They are either centralized or low volume.
1. centralized = central control - which defeats the whole point of decentralized cryptocurrency.  Basically this is the same as the current financial situation.  One person/group is in charge of everyone's funds and has the issue to issue, block, and seize at their will.  With bitcoin, no one can control anyone else's holdings.
2. Low volume = No one is using the block chains that claim to be faster than bitcoin.  The reason bitcoin is slower is because it is actually processing transactions.  Other coins are not and just claim they have a solution, but it is untested since no one is really adopting anything else compared to bitcoin.
*Second,  why do you believe XRP and XLM to go to 0, when they have huge  corporate partners and can process transactions much faster than BTC?*
I don't know if they will go to 0 but bitcoin has proven itself to be a much better investment so far.
*Finally, why must BTC be this “reference”, crypto for all altcoins, over a stablecoin?*
Bitcoin was the first successful implementation of a cryptocurrency that caught on main stream.  There were others before it (like hash cash) but Bitcoin is a combination of its predecessors, which I don't think exist anymore.
Most ICOs &amp; alotcoins have a founder who created the currency and issued a ton of them to themselves.  So that's what kind of makes bitcoin special to me.  Satoshi's quote on the genesis block, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" is a pretty epic message to the masses on his creation.  I don't think anyone smart enough to create bitcoin and decide to quote that headline has poor intentions.  I trust his vision and believe it has the power to improve the world.  If I get rich, great, but I think public information would keep institutions open &amp; transparent &amp; potentially be the silver bullet to tackling corruption in this world.  However, I could also be a crazy lunatic writing on the internet that has gone too far down the rabbit hole to ever get out.

@_date: 2019-04-30 18:15:56
Surprised it’s that much! Honestly I don’t think this matters too much. These guys are huge and do a shitload in revenue. Someone will give them money if they need it...like another institution etc because they are going to make a killing on the inevitable next bull run. I guess I don’t have all the information and this is just my bs speculation, but this all seems like a non-issue. I don’t have anything in tether so I don’t care either.

Idk there’s a difference between fees when it’s person to person and exchange to person. Why would you ever share? They’re pretty cheap these days because fees are based on supply and demand.

The sails made of fiat broke and are not working properly. They are catching wind and moving them closer to a huge scary wave, which is their doom. Those on the left side of the ship are mourning the loss of the past and are accepting they are going to die, since they believe there’s nothing they can do. Those on the right are looking for an alternative option and are very hopeful. One is waving an orange towel at what looks like orange sails in case it really needs to be spelled out. They embrace one another to show unity I guess.

Sign up for coinbase pro and read up on desktop wallets and hardware wallet. If you buy more than $500 worth a hardware wallet is prob worth it. You may have to go outside of your comfort zone and not use fidelity if you want all of the advantages of owning bitcoin.

1. Halving
2. Uncertainty in stock market etc
3. Institutions
4. Mania 
Look into “halving”. The inflation rate of bitcoin decreases by 50% every four years or so is the short explanation. The next halving should occur about 1 year from today. Therefore everyone is trying to buy bitcoin cheaper now because they are going to be significantly more scarce in 1 year. 
People believe bitcoin is a strong store of value like gold, except more capable. In last recession those put money in gold protected their net worth. If bitcoin is an alternative to gold then it should be a good place to park your money during a poor financial market
Look up Bakkt &amp; fidelity. Those are two ways for institutions to invest in bitcoin. Institutions have to adhere to rules and can’t just buy bitcoin with other peoples money. They need a licensed custodian to secure &amp; insure it. Both of these companies claim to be taking their platforms live soon. 
In general bitcoin is very volatile. As soon as we get in a bull run everyone piles their money in. It’s very difficult for people to stay on the sidelines and watch the price climb, especially if they are waiting for it to drop so they can buy in cheap. Eventually they will sick of waiting and buy in at a high price. Since lots of people will do this the price will move up extremely high until everyone has tons of unrealized gains. Then a giant whale will sell an enormous portion of their bitcoin which starts a massive sell off. Everyone will want to realize what’s left of their gains thus crashing the price. That is why it’s best to hold for 5+ years and buy when you know the price is low. I do not know if the current price is low or not, since bitcoin has been pretty undervalued since the last major sell off.

Well this is why you don’t keep bitcoins on an exchange. You force them to send it to you and then you have total control over the bitcoin. As far as printing more bitcoin goes, this is impossible as bitcoin is mined not printed like fiat currency.

If services, companies, people, other gov agencies, etc all make their public address known and there is a random transaction to an unknown address we can say, “What was that for? Who executed it?”And then get some answers. Or, “you said you were going to pay x for this but you paid y. What’s up with that?”That would bring a level of transparency that we don’t have currently. Of course this would be many years from now but that’s what I kind of envision as a transparent and honest government.

If you’re caught there is a good chance they will say you’re stealing power for profit. That looks pretty bad. You can say “oh but I didn’t know I couldn’t do it” and then the person will think:
1. You’re a liar
2. You’re an idiot
