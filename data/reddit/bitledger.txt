Apples to Oranges, Ethereum had to fork, the fork is already in the rear view mirror, and the way Ethereum handle the classic fork was smart they paid no attention to the weaker team, and its withering on the vine.
As far as Bitcoin forking, Bitcoin will need to fork at some point, and when it does, it maybe a similar result.
It all depends on how we do it, I believe in Soft Fork vs Hard Fork if possible.
Here 's is the mistake people keep making, Developers DO NOT FORK Networks,  Networks Fork Networks, whether its a Soft Fork or Hard Fork.
If The majority of Eth holders where against the fork, the Fork would have failed, just as Bitcoin Classic and XT Before it have failed. Because the Economic Super-Majority has no interest.
Bitcoin will fork the day the Economic Super Majority feels that it is necessary to protect their investment, just as Ethereum did.
If anything as a very conservative -*a fork is the last resort* - type of person, I thought Ethereum pulled theirs off perfectly with minimal impact, given the time pressures they where under and in the end the ETH/ETHClassic was a massive gift to Ethereum holders, who basically got increase their stake in Ethereum at no cost, while external investor made a horrendous bet on Classic.
I welcome such an opportunity in Bitcoin

This is the paradox of Bitcoin, exchanges provide liquidity and make it a viable asset, however Bitcoin cannot be traded in a decentralized manner, and never will be withouth perhaps Ethereum at some point.
As a result, the minute you start to interact with Bitcoin you invariably get to some point where you need to "trust" someone.
@_date: 2016-08-26 22:16:55
I agree the Ethereum foundation and Ethereum Development has more influence, Ethereum overall is a much smaller and tighter community and the early stages of new network, it also why apples to oranges vs Bitcoin much more developed, aged and decentralized.
I disagree the Ethereum holders just went along,  If Ethereum holders felt the fork was wrong or they would've moved against it. Either by dumping ETH or sticking with the alternative.  The foundation can't compel people to not sell Ether.  Obviously Ether investors believe in the foundation, and supported the transition. I see nothing wrong with that. Ethereum like Bitcoin should not be run based on the opinions of non-owners. 
For those directly involved the fork was compelling because of the huge risk posed by the attacker and the ongoing drama which served as huge distraction to the development of Ethereum.  
I totally see it as one off event.

Customer is always right is not a legal defense. The fact is Bitgo positioned itself as a bit coin security and manged security for bitfinex.
It's not a stretch to assume many account holder used bfx primarily because of bitgo claimed security.
If bfx were to have undermined bitgo security  to point it was just marketing and bitgo new this then they had a duty to inform users of their service and to even compel bfx to reinstate the security policies or remove  their service.

Make sure that you did not setup multiple email confirmations.
So there are 2 vault products,
1. Is just a regular Bitcoin Account with extra security. One of the features is it may send 2 or more emails to two separate accounts, you need to approve the transaction from both accounts, if not the transaction will time out and fail.
2. Is a multi-Sig Vault, where if you should be holding 2 sets of keys you can then export the bitcoins to another wallet using the tool: 
I don't know why I am helping in a coinbase thread, its a love hate relationship.

If that is the case bitgo, is still liable as they violated their own best practices, the customer is not always right and bitgo, may have a fiduciary duty to individual account holdera who presumed that their bit coins were secured by Bitgo security practices.
I don't see how Bitgo or Bitfinex still exist in 6 months. Unlike Bitstamp who covered the loss, bitfinex is insolvent and the minute they open their trade window all assets will fly out of there since no one knows what else is comprised.
The reality is Hong Kong financial authority should be in bitfinex office right now freezing the whole thing and conducting and orderly shutdown

No you are incorrect.  Banks do not lend based on reserves.  You are implying that Banks are restricted to lend based on deposits on hand.
That is not how modern banking works.  Banks are not restrained by their reserves but rather their access to capital. A healthy bank can issue loans as long as there is demand without needing to wait for depositors.  Instead Banks just tap capital markets to maintain their reserve limits.
So OP Is correct Bitcoin is not compatible with the expectations of a modern monetary system, because there is no mechanism to issue loans without first having Bitcoins. The old chicken and egg.  Modern Fiat systems are not based on MONEY as the primer  but rather on the productive capability of the borrower.  Now we can argue till the cows come home on whether this is sound monetary principle, or whether some full reserve backed system is better.

The minute you raise the 2MB limit, all the scaling development effort will be cut in half or more. I guarantee it.  
Meaning the time to get a long term scaling solution will take as long or longer, and we will be back at this argument in 6-8 months.  
Why not let the devs work, and let see what comes up.  
SegWit alone is practically a 2MB bump.
If it takes 6 more months Bitcoin is not going to explode like a red-lined car engine.

Bitcoin has it's place as the king of blockchains.  Maybe this is truly better but I think the markets are more perceptive.
My thoughts are:
1. Will this be censorship resistant. No it will not, it will have to comply with global and financial regulations.
2. Will it be immutable: No see point 1, additionally Finance companies will never accept the consequences of an error or bad decisions. Do overs are part of their business model and baked in the form of socializing risk. 
3. Will it be distributed.  I doubt IBM and JP Morgan are going to permit equal footing to a startup in bangladesh in this system.  
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:59:08
bitcoin won't break if over the limit. That's the way bitcoin self regulates. The system can only scale at technical limits.  
My point being that if growth exceeds bitcoins technical ability to scale there is nothing that can be done.  That's why fees go up.
When I refer to buying time, I mean to implement a better process to scale bitcoin that doesnt require hard forking or if it does to have a plan in place.

The decision to raise or not raise the block size should be a technical one.  there is no technical reason not to raise the block size, to at lease 3MB.
BIP 102, should be scheduled to kick in 12 months. With SegWit and BIP 102, it should at least buy us a couple years.
Either we establish a process for scaling blocks, or we establish and hardfork process for increasing block size based on technical requirements that balance decentralization with bitcoin scaling.
Block size was never meant to be fixed.

The only reason for against raising the block size should be technical ones.  The debate always gets pulled into economics, and frankly that is more vodoo and tea leaves than actual science.
But if we are going to talk economics, Bitcoin was hot-wired for settlement the day Satoshi decided to cap the issuance.  Gersham's law takes precedence and as long as bitcoin is better money it will not be used for everyday transactions.
Aside from that, the block size needs to go up and it should go up based on a technical analysis of what is appropriate and what maintains bitcoins decentralization and censorship resistance.   
If the block size can be autoscaled so be it, if not there should be a protocol and roadmap with a rotating committee dedicated to bitcoin scaling and managing the needed hardforks  but on a very infrequent basis with a 6 month to 1 year heads up, maybe in counter step with the bitcoin halving.
The block size is a technical limit imposed as anti-spam measure and it has an added benefit of helping keep bitcoin decentralized. 
The creeping economics argument have no place and it's not up to any devs to decide if an when a fee market develops.  
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:16:18
So banks will still have to comply with all existing regulations. All this is a watered down tech built to shave a few points of their back end.
  
*Censor *can mean all kinds of powers that exist today and more so.
Are they going to permit you to transfer unlimited funds from one account to another no questions asked. The technology has no restrictions. 
* Will they allow you to create unlimited accounts
* Will they allow to have account anonymously
* Will you be permitted to sends funds globally
*Roll back* in the financial world occurs under settlement rules. However these rules can fluctuate if need be, there is always a way out. Extreme circumstances may call for extreme measures, today banks can to some extent throw their hands up and say, listen we don't have a way to track back a transaction outside our control. With a blockchain they could go back months, years if need be and see the complete history.  Understand that these systems are back doors to regulators, and regulators will have unprecedented views to financial transactions. 
Do you believe regulators will sit by after discovering that a particular transaction was used to fund some illicit act. Regulators make decisions on a political basis we see it all the time.  HSBC was caught laundering money for Iran, no jail time.  However citizen joe gets caught laundering money, jail time.   
I believe that this movements will actually accelerate peoples use of bitcoin, Because all that is being done here  is to take the technology to try and restrict people further. It's not about enabling innovation or freedom at the user level its about more control and more profits at the bank and institution level.

It seems to me that we are at the point of needed hard fork, based on both your discussions.
The improvements to bitcoin are piling up, and now we have the block size issue, which while I feel its not at the level of emergency, it is a technical limit to bitcoin, which can be raised and needs to be raised in conjunction with SegWit, to allow bitcoin continued to stability for the next few years.
Perhaps it should be SegWit now with a scheduled hardfork in 1 year to include the clean up and blocksize.  
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:18:36

@_date: 2015-12-30 19:08:22
Can we stop the drama that bitcoin is going to redline and explode.  Block limit is a technical issue it should go up and it will. But raising the block limit should be a technical decesion not an economic one.
The economics is up to the participants.
I believe the block size should go up to 2MB, to gather data, but it should go up based on a technical argument which can be articulated.
The mistake people keep making is saying we need to raise the block limit because of fees. Fees are part of bitcoin, its how the system works. That is not a reason to raise it.  It also means, there is no immediate danger like bitcoin is going to hit some mystical wall and break.

It can appear more expensive, there is also how far you want to go in incorporating costs including social costs etc.

Technically Paul maybe be right, but from an economics standpoint and social utility the world doesn't work that way.
The fact that Litecoin still runs despite having ha $100 million dollar bounty shows that maximilism in the sense that all altcoins will be eaten by Bitcoin eventually is not reality. Now you could argue from an engineering standpoint that Litecoin is really just an aberration, and over 100 year time frame may not exist.  
But we can only go on recent history. The world is full of variety even when evidence and science and even economics point to better systems.
So even if you concede that Ethereum is Vaporware (clearly its not),  people will still spend money on vaporware.
However if you take a step back.
Ethereum and other altcoins are already anchored to Bitcoin.
Ethereum will never exist without Bitcoin, because it is the stability of Bitcoin Network that underpins the ability to fund and transact in the crypto economies that exist on top.
If tomorrow the world wanted to fund Ethereum, they will in most cases buy Bitcoin to get to Ethereum. Sure they could fund directly in some exchanges Fiat to Ethereum, but the cryptoworld is anchored around Bitcoin.  
I can exchange ether to Bitcoin, and deposit it to any exchange or service globally. I am not going back to Fiat to move things around.
Bitcoin is the USD of the Cryptoworld.
If Ethereum's crowdsale had to be funded via Fiat Banking Ethereum would not exist.  Its the ability to fund these systems via decentralized censorship resistant currency that makes all these experiments possible. 
So I agree in Bitcoin maximalism that Bitcoin is the new territory of freedom, call it the New Cyber Colonies.  And what the Cyber world needs more than anything is a stable immutable bitcoin to underpin everything, because if Ethereum fails or breaks the value embedded in the system would flow back to Bitcoin.
But if Bitcoin failed a much more simpler system, the value of all crypto would collapse. How could Ethereum succeed if Bitcoin could not.
I see no competition between Ethereum and Bitcoin, Ethereum is the Operating System to Bitcoin's Core Protocol or Machine Language.  Ethereum cannot exist without bitcoin, it's not possible.

There is no winner take all.  Bitcoin has a specific purpose, it is the anchor to the global cyber political system that is evolving.  This does not mean there may not be others.  Is there only one nation, or one democracy, or one OS, etc.  Absolutism is not practical and not realistic.
You keep referring to VISA and that is a mistake to compare to Bitcoin. What is the Transactions Per Seconds of the US Dollar.  VISA is a system that is a final layer in financial system.  Bitcoin will have future VISAs, maybe VISA. There will be many layers and technologies that may eventually sit on-top of Global Cyber Currencies.    
No one can step up and take the lead over Bitcoin. Because you cannot have both, highly distribute immutable ledger with an ever increasing value and security, and a highly circulated payment system with no transaction costs. What you want is a violation of the laws of physics.
Network effects mean nothing, it is a fallacy sold by Silicon valley to imply some proverbial wall, that seemingly last long enough until you dump your rotten business model on the next sucker. You can peruse the deadpool of companies in the last decade alone which have had massive network effects disappear overnight. In the digital age the cost to switch is ZERO, and where you may not be able to switch, you can build APIs which will allow you to offload your costs when it is economically beneficial, thereby leaving the "network" with High Cost/Low Gain Transactions.  As such network effects mean little.  What matters is position, you network effect is only viable so long as you position in the mind of the user is secured.
Also you have flawed view of money, money is not valuable because it is circulated, if that was the Case Weimar Republic would still be here.  Money is valuable because there is a social and political system that backs it.  This idea that Gold is valuable in the abstract is false. Gold was valuable and is valuable because there is a social system which backs gold today.    Gold does not circulate and yet its valuable, same as my previous example of art. 
Bitcoin is valuable because the Bitcoin Network requires you use Bitcoin to participate, the Bitcoin Network is what people want access to, not bitcoin.
If the Bitcoin network become some fork every week, 51% decides the rules, Bitcoin would be worth ZERO or close too, like all the other junk alt currencies.  
So you need to ask yourself what is reality, people need Bitcoin because consumers pays to much currently to transact or people need Bitcoin because they are searching for a system which allows them to escape the financial repression being waged on them.  
Many keep falling into a perception trap, they are viewing and arguing from the wrong positions, because their point of view is clouded by their current paradigms.

But unless you can provide some billion dollar incentive for your version of bitcoin, all these attempts are alternate versions a waste of time particularly the way they are being presented.

Not treat them like customers, who if they don't pay don't get service, and the ones who pay the most get preferential treatment.
Bitcoin is a political economic system. Can you attempt to make it more attractive to outside participants who are not interested in it?
Should you?  
Maybe that is what you want, but what about all the other participants who maybe happy with it. How do you get them to go along with that, particularly if it means you need them to sacrifice in order to meet the goals of current non-participants?
Look the world you view you bring up is understood because it was how we were taught to the view world.    Bitcoin challenges that.

I would like to drop by your house everyday for several hours to watch tv.  There is no real cost to you, you pay no additional rent for my presence, and you pay no additional consumption for my TV usage.
Yet is is clear that my presence has a real social and economic cost to you and changes the dynamics of your home. 
Your point of view is very incorrect, particular when there is a real cost, every transaction written to the blockchain consumes actual storage and bandwidth costs for eternity. In addition the utility costs that affect the centralization and dynamics of the network, not to mention that in order to make this change it requires a change to hard rules of the network.
So you are wrong to claim it is artificial scarcity anymore than you can claim the 21 million limit is artificial scarcity. The block-limit is a necessary to the proper function and to maintain the characteristics of the network. 
Those who do not believe it must the convince the entire network otherwise.

My statement is true, I was not applying it to miners profitability. 
My point was that simply raising the blocksize will not correct the problem of allowing more users on the network for free.   This is a common misconception that simply raising the block-limit implies more bitcoin "users".
The reality is that decentralization or Bitcoin is a limited resource not infinite and it has both physical and social / economic utility constraints.
If the next 1mb of transactions for example, is flooded by Fidelity writing transactions to the blockchain it does not mean all of sudden you can onboard more "users" the only way that this is corrected, is by the cost to write transactions to increment.  The increasing cost is about a recognition of those who value decentralization and those who don't
There will always be a blocklimit because there is a real cost to decentralization and that is bitcoin product.

It's good the miner's recognize that a low threshold hard fork is a terrible Idea, 90% is still on the low side.
The problem though is that miners have no way to gauge what does the remaining 10% of hashing power + nodes + economic supporters can gather.
It's still enough for a small community to fork away from the "bitcoin" community and implement a new PoW.  
The economic participants maybe tempted by acquiring a new mining decentralized coin.  Could a 10% Bitcoin be a 600 million dollar coin?
You are now left with a community that forked and is trying to decentralize bitcoin and community that voted in favor centralization.
Now that the Bitcoin Large ejected 10% of the hashing power and community, they now can keep forking bitcoin larger, and if they kick 10% out who resists, you get more centralization.
Sorry but Hard forking bitcoin for a ~~2~~ 1mb increase looks increasingly stupid.

So your solution is rather than increasing the cost on the attacker, we perpetually raise blocksize under threat of attack.  Allowing the attacker to fill up the next block and zero cost, and then only pay the increasing fees when legitimate transactions compete with them, meanwhile he gets the added benefit of bloating the blockchain
Doesn't seem like a credible plan.
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:08:14
Some questions I see.
**If the majority wins it's an attack now?**
Yes if the majority but not all parties vote to change the rules of the game after the game is in motion, they are attacking the minority.
It does not matter if you are changing something minor, or removing the 21 cap, if consensus is not achievable, it means that minority party will view it as an attack.  
Also voting is not a perfect resolution either and introduces it's own Game Mechanics.
Did not get into,  it but you can also see how public voting mechanics actually work to the benefit of the majority or close to majority. Every vote cast in favor of majority in public without the final results reinforces their dominant position, and dissuades opposition.  This is why Private voting is used in democracies, and why for example media does not report results until after polls. close to not influence results.
Unfortunately that is inherent of an open network, everyone gets to see everyones power and they get to signal intention or even vote publicly. This is also why low threshold votes should be viewed as attacks. Because if it was common good, it would be evident to all, so reaching a high threshold should be no problem.
Tyranny of the majority.
**What About Soft Forks?**
1. Hard forks are rewriting the rules of the system after the system is set in motion, and is not self-evident needed, can be view as an attack.   Hard Forking because we discover SHA-256 can be cracked, vs Hard Forking to a 10MB Block. For example. 
2. Soft Forks are part of the rules. The rules allow soft forks.
3. Better response then I can explain, but Soft Forks  are permissible within the existing rules.
4.  Still a problem, to change game mechanics, but much harder.
5. Still Soft Forks, with low thresholds, are not good either, This is why it is so important to achieve high consensus levels, north of 90 or 95%.  So that it is proof of a common good.
6. Evil Soft Forks, are the same as Hard Fork. has follow up blog post on evil soft forks.  And maybe more dangerous. Imagine if Core had been releasing auto update software?   
. 
**Aren't Core Developers Centralizing?**
1. Yes, and they are aware of this too, which is why if you read their statements, they have taken no action. Why many have elected to give up commit access, and typically call it a burden not benfit.
2. If you believe in decentralization, than you want to keep everything cool.   Because you realize every push you make will result in a push back.
**So you want the block size to be 1mb forever ..die die**
No. I am saying why hard forks, whether it is for SegWit to hard fork, unlimited blocks, 2mb, tons of other "improvements" Should always be contested by the minority if they exist, whether it is 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% they play a role in keeping the the system decentralized.
If there is no minority opposition, then the hard fork is uncontested, it this tells you either the system is already centralized, or the hard forks (rule change) was of equal benefit to all, and it was self evident.  
This is simplified, real life is complex, and works on probabilities and statistical distributions. Decentralization is not binary.
Also proponents of  Hard Forks to avoid nuclear scenarios, should aim for 90%+ consensus. If they cannot achieve that they need to determine if the attack is worth it. 
What we are seeing some call tragedy of the commons, but this is the  reality of decentralized systems. 
It is possible for everyone to walk of a cliff together because we are unable to see a common threat.

You know I always agree with that sentiment, but has there been any evidence that someone has been tracked simply via their bitcoin address. 
Despite the ledger being in plain, site.  Even at the small scale that bitcoin is, unmasking someone by just their bitcoin address is pretty hard especially if you take precautions.
Sure after someone is pinched and you get access to their keys, everything is obvious. 
But trying to unmask a bitcoin address, I am just not convinced you would get very far,  without major data mining and the ability to crack third party databases and or subpoena IPs, even then if you took precautions those looking for you my find dead ends.

Bitcoin was worth twice as much 2 years ago, when no one outside of a few hundred people cared about the block size.
The block size is a self made crisis, which has not delivered the apocalyptic results that they prophets have warned about.
Bitcoin keeps working, fees are barely going up, and all that the fees have shown is how poorly written most wallet clients are.
The writing is on the wall for the hard forkers, I predict that this debate dies out in the next 90 days, as Bitcoin classic fails to go nowhere and segwit gets closer to deployment.
Developers who work on hard forks, have to be politicians first and developers second.
Bitcoin is the rejection of politics, I don't care what a kenyan thinks is right politically or what a Brazilian, or a miner in china.  all that matters is that there is enough of all us in the network, that no one can do anything to affect my economic interests.

A stadium holds 100,000 people.  10 people purchased 20,000 seats to leave them empty and keep out 40,000.  Because it was cheap and just because.
You can however pay a higher fee and still get an available seat.
It is a proven economics that pricing a good below cost encourages hoarding and over-consumption. 
The block limit is a tangible representation of the economic cost of decentralization.  When more people want decentralization they will pay more to insure their transactions get included in the decentralized system.  
The network will figure out additional ways to scale as it always has without sacrificing decentralization.

80% of the wealth in the United States in concentrated in the top 20%, most of it probably locked up in long term assets, CD's, Real Estate, Retirement holdings, and businesses.  Small transactions have no economic bearing in the large scale of things.  
Global Remittances is nothing compared to the flow of funds between nations.
The fact is Bitcoin needs to prove it is a stable immutable store of value, that the world can trust. Not that it can pay for your newegg memory transactions cheaper than VISA.
There is no congestion in bitcoin, since the network can accommodate increase demand via pricing.  In addition scaling is and has always been a part of bitcoin, anyone who believes that Bitcoin's capitalization will change because it moves from 1mb to 2mb, is mistaken. The technical improvements from such a change are minimal, however the cost of attempting to carry out the change can be significant.
The idea Bitcoin has to be VISA to be gold is not credible.  In fact ART is valued, it is transacted, and it used in exchanges for other properties in many instances, yet it has zero network payment characteristics. There are many assets like this.   
I am not arguing Bitcoin should be arbitrarily constricted, I am merely saying that Bitcoins unique properties are what make it valuable, its network effect is an added component of the valuation to Bitcoin. However by Bitcoins very nature existing on the internet and being un-censorable it has full global coverage, whether it supports 1 million vs 500,000 transactions is not as critical to its success, particularly if increasing transaction throughput comes at the cost of decentralization.

I think it's possible for Ethereum to eventually move into the number 2 spot ahead of litecoin.  Litecoin serves no purpose at this point except to be a testbed for Bitcoin, and frankly I am not sure it even does that anymore.
If you want a fast confirmation altcoin you can use ethereum. Ethereum actually has smart contracts running, and decentralized apps. It just so limited right run now because its really in an alpha state, there is no GUI wallet.
I believe over time, Bitcoin will build the hooks to whatever is worth hooking into Ethereum and vice versa, and create a truly global decentralized platforms.
However as long as Bitcoin keeps doing what its doing it will be the gold standard, the savings account, the 5th avenue condo you keep in a family trust. 
It's interesting because you go to Ethereum sub and 90% of the posts are development work of some kind or technical discussions. Compare that to r/bitcoin.  The only real innovation happening in bitcoin right now is inside Blockstream, the dev list.  There isn't much big picture stuff to do on bitcoin until either LN or Side Chains, or maybe rootstock launches.   So instead you can get hundreds of hours wasted on discussing  increasing a block limit. (If you look over the 7 years this has been an issue probably 1000's of collective man hours wasted on this topic) I know there are big picture issues at stake but just think of the collective drain on bitcoin the block size debate has become. wasting time on forums, schism in the community, vitriol, hours and hours of posts for or against.

How would you get the miners to approve it? They just wouldn't mine the coin, unless you mean, that you change the PoW and the minority mines the new chain with new PoW, while Majority mines forked chain with Old PoW?
And since the Mining hardware is not compatible with this new PoW scheme they cannot attack the new chain, so they lose their only veto power
So you effectively fork the networks completely?  Am I getting that right? A new coin emerges with the old coin?
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:21:00
I think your proposal is closer to the ideal.
But wouldn't just a simple predictions market also be valid. 
The probability of a hard fork is akin to bond prices reflecting a default by the U.S. Government.  Core is Bitcoin, the u.s government plays both side of the ledger so the risk of a default is tiny.
Meaning core could always pivot to defuse any risk a hard fork may present and they have by proposing segwit and a road map.
So too I believe is the risk of a hard fork, if a hard fork was actual reality hard forkers would not keep lowering the threshold and the change.
I think this would show however that the support for any Hard Fork of Bitcoin is tiny.  Since if there was actual money behind a hard fork it would've happened already.
Everyone wants the block size to go up, no one actually wants to go through a hard fork to do it.

you again are looking at the specific cost of a miner or node in going from 1mb to Xmb and missing the big picture cost to the network.
I don't care what the use cases are for Bitcoin, I only care that Bitcoin remain decentralized, immutable and censorship-resistant. It is up to each user to determine what their use case is.
I can reverse your argument and claim you on the other hand want to sacrifice or risk the above in order to service particular use cases, who only see economic utility when the network is at a lower transaction cost.
@_date: 2016-03-01 23:26:32
You are confusing models.  SPAM to add on to comment is communication which has no economic utility to the receiver.
The Blockchain is the post box of bitcoin, if we provide unlimited access someone must bear the cost of reading and growing the postbox to fill every transaction.
The blocklimit prevents someone from attacking by submitting one large item and also by trying to fill it with many small cheap items. When the post box fills, we have an added tool which allows you to bid for access.
Your willingness to  submit payment to bitcoin network is now a signal that your transaction has economic utility to the receiver (network).
In the case of the postal mail, your payment is to the post office which cares nothing for the impact to the end user.  The correct model would be if you were able to charge vendors for delivery to your postbox to cover the cost of maintaining it and your time in reading and disposing of their mails.  The fact that there is no cost to the sender accounts for why you receive spam in the first place.

No. It's not  the attack is always there yoiu just notice it more because fees rise to punish the attacker as blockspsce becomes limited.

You are using example of central external authority intervening into a system, which reinforces my point, that if the attack is threat to all the system will coalesce to repel the attack, if the external attack is a benefit to some and a negative to others in the system, then you get Contentious Hard Forks.
There is no Good or Bad in decentralized consensus systems. There are no honest parties, you have to assume all parties will act to their self interest.


Developers are not in charge of anything, and over time they will have less and less perceived authority, as the system decentralizes.
Also, If I follow your logic Bitcoin Devs are in charge, than bitcoin was never decentralized, in which your attack as the majority is for what purpose? Since Core Devs are in charge and they are presumably part of the Majority? Do you see how your logic breaks down.
There is no one in charge in decentralized system, if there is someone in charge its not decentralized.

Personally I think that it is flawed thinking because you are using Game Theory within the system to explain behavior outside the system.
When you do a contentious fork, and you can argue what percentage is correct, but  95% is closer to 100 and 75% is closer to 51% than 100% you risk splitting the network. Not just the coin but the entire protocol and what it means to be bitcoin and participate in bitcoin.
There is no way to measure the economic damage until after it is done.
Also, if the minority leaves because the rules have changed and it is no longer profitable to mine, or they don't want to participate, they maybe motivated  to create an alternate coin which will siphon value.  Again Bitcoin was created for this reason, why did people exist the current system, why did very bright men who could have made millions, including Gavin, sacrifice so much, just to create Paypal 2.0.
Do you think people will not be motivated to do the same to Bitcoin. Ethereum was a piece paper less than 2 years ago and the butt of Jokes.  Who made the better decision over the last 2 years?
Bitcoin once had a market cap of 14 billion, it is now struggling to keep its current value of 7 billion.  The fact that the world is in meltdown and Bitcoin has barely climbed from it's hole is already a very bad warning sign. What is happening is that Capital Controls are working and bitcoin is being centralized already, if you want to get bitcoin you need to go through a gateway, it is being ring fenced.  Eventually the damn may break or it may not.
Meanwhile all the things you claim that add value to the network have gone up, but the market doesn't care why is  that?
I feel it's because the market doesn't see any value in a centralized coin.  Every time there is an attempt to fork the protocol without consensus you have to wonder, how can I believe that 10 years from now Bitcoin will have any value?  If eventually it will centralize around a few mega participants, that will comply with all global a regulation, and will treat me like my current 
bank. 
I will gladly pay $1000 to guarantee the fruits of my labor get transferred to my heirs without government theft.  
When people flee government oppression they don't go looking for the financial system with free checking, and a toaster.  They want liberty and respect for their property.  They don't worry about grabbing the starbucks coupon they go for the gold.  
Sorry but 10 years of 75% hard forks to raise block size, and you will eventually end up with Facebook running nodes, and Alibaba running the miners.  Assuming there is even any interest in Bitcoin at that point.
Core or Gavin should raise it to 95% and trust the network to do the right thing.

I am no economist but I play one on TV.  I feel Bitcoin's medium of exchange will be underwhelming until something like LN comes on board.
I can't help but feel that Gersham's law will rule bitcoin for a long time, and people will not spend bitcoin until there is a system that allows them to spend bitcoin without spending bitcoin.
Here is bitcoins current life cycle.
1 Mine Bitcoin, sell what you need to pay expenses, save the rest
2. Buy Bitcion, buy with what  you can afford to SAVE.
3. maybe spend bitcoin, but really spend your dying dollars.
That's gersham law, you will spend the bad currency and push out the good currency. And when you factor in that people get paid in the bad currency first, they will circulate it first and will use the good "currency" or asset as reserve account.
This is a generational evolution, bitcoin first needs to become an established store of value, and maybe some type of medium of exchange.   I don't see bitcoin becoming a primary payment system, until its potential for appreciation normalizes and that could be a few decades out.
The people who are buying bitcoin today are not doing it to buy movie tickets, or buy cheap goods, they are making a lotto shot that the world will need a bearer asset like bitcoin sometime in the future.
You don't shop ebay with your 401k or your tesla stock and that's why all these consumer apps, as needed as they are, need to be put in perspective that they are targeting a segment within a segment,(Bitcoin people who like to spend bitcoin)

Voting cost nothing and means nothing in bitcoin.
The evolution of the block size debate shows just how un-forkable bitcoin is. This debate started the moment Satoshi hard coded the block size.
When it comes time the economic damage will far out weigh any gain from a 1mb increase.
Every day bitcoin grows it becomes harder to fork.
How will forking even work at a network 10 times this size.
6 years to maybe get a 1mb increase with 75% of hashing power, that required centralized mining.
I have said it before the only hope of a fork is to convince the network that failure to fork is fatal to the network. That is the strategy of the hard forkers now.
However the evidence shows otherwise. 
Like I said let's do it roll the dice.

If miners and nodes want to run it great if they want to attemtp to fork the network and run , something as useless as Bitcoin Classic which has no code, great.
If miners want to attempt to update tehmselves great.

Good post your wasting your time, its the same clueless fainboism that grips linux vs microsoft or xbox vs playstation, pepsi vs coke, bmw vs mercedes, on and on.
Humans are incapable of holding what they ignorantly perceive as two contradicting positions even if reality shows both are perfectly valid.
Is it a particle or a wave?
Meanwhile winners use both.  
Bitcoin needs ethereum just like ethereum needs bitcoin.
I perceive a bright future for both, bitcoin will never despite much hype do what ethereum does.  And when the day comes that it "claims" it will do it at 50%, meanwhile ethereum was not built to be the rock stable never changing source of value that Bitcoin was.  
The inflation model is perfectly valid model for ethereum and its not even a true inflation model, and it may change. It's interesting to see how many "educated" people know so much about very little.  In any event the currency of ethereum was not meant to be  a final store of value but a tool to power the Virtual machine that is ethereum.
So Ethereum can take risks, and experiment whereas bitcoin cannot.  It can fork many times over, it has a steward in Vitalik which despite much mud slinging has show immense maturity for someone who is what 22?
Alas, I won't mention what I was doing at 22.   
Ethereum can do these things because Bitcoin exists. Just like Bitcoin can be the best store of value because if you want cutting edge programmable systems you can use ethereum, and leave Bitcoin alone.
Only the fool believes that there is a "perfect" anything.
So relax, and get both.
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:44:47
I had a bigger post for r/ethereum but deleted, so I guess I ll just post my thoughts here.
I have to disagree with Mr. Todd here, even though I have been very anti-fork and generally find myslef almost in agreement with him 99% of the other topics he writes about.
1.  Ethereum is still very early on, it is nowhere as decentralized as Bitcoin.  Ethereum is where Bitcoin was maybe a few years back when Satoshi was still at the helm.  So I have no issue with ethcore devs and Vitalik shepherding the project through this early stage disaster just as Satoshi, Hal, and others did.  Ethereum is still very alpha as we are all learning and so, while crypto is a much bigger space overall I think its a stretch that Governments or nasty 4 letter agencies can do much at this stage. The risk is no greater to any other Open Source devs working on critical tech.  They can of course make life difficult for anyone, but I believe Ethereum by far has been the most mature and prudent software development project in the cryptospace outside of the current bitcoin leading companies.  Even if they got to Vitalik, it wouldn't matter the software is open source and in the hands of miners and Eth holders.
2.  Hard Forking at this stage is something doable, as Ethereum just like Bitcoin grows and spreads hard forks will become almost impossible.  As we are seeing with Bitcoin.   So the risk of setting precedents I don't think means anything.   Because if Ethereum like Bitcoin is the hands of billions five or 10 years from now , with mutlibillion dollar market caps, good luck getting any hard fork done.
3.  Hardfork consensus is baloney until the fork occurs.  I've always believed fork threshold for miners should be close to 90% or better. Let miners worry about consensus. If miners feel the users will support a fork, they will fork, if users don't they won't.  There is no need for fancy gimmicks to measure consensus.   Forks should really be do or die affairs.
If we discovered zero day bug in the bitcoin protocol, do we need to create a coin vote mechanism to push a fork, heck no. The alternative is no bitcoin.   Miners have an incentive to protect the protocol.
In this case I believe the alternative to allow the attacker the win here, is pretty horrendous.
I am pretty certain Ethereum could hit a 90% threshold fork with ease.  The DAO was a disaster, everyone learned their lesson, best thing is to fix the mistake and move on, rather than create a prolonged drama and let the attacker run the show for the next few months.
Full Disclosure, longtime bitcoin holder, ethereum presale participant, and saw the DAO for what it was so I hold less than 1000 Dao tokens, so I don't care about the DAO, but care greatly about Bitcoin and Ethereum succeeding.

Bitcoin's complexity is far beyond, the 95% who populate these forums.
This decisions in the end will be decided by the elite on both sides of the issue.
Remember history is not about the best, or the moral, its strictly about the winner.
I believe the optimal solution will win. Its quite possible the Segwit 2x Coup is pulled off, if that's the case who cares, it shows a flaw in the nakamoto-consensus that its mining centralization is an issue, and it finally came to pass. Buyer beware.
More than likely there will be a counter fork, with PoW that splits of at some point.  Its quite possible that multiple incompatible Bitcoin- Alt-Chains evolve carrying the same genesis, and 50 years from know 2 or 3 compete for authenticity, with a rabid cult like fan base.

I have researched this extensively and Bitcoin has never hard forked the way it is being proposed and the way many are promoting as some perpetual upgrade cycle. Windows 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 10, etc.
Contentious is the current term, but I am beginning to believe not even Core can hard fork bitcoin.  I believe that any attempt by core to hard fork bitcoin without showing that we have hit a zero day roadblock will invalidate Core as a trusted source of development, and they will encounter the same issues as all others. The network will reject it. Again, people confuse hashing power with network support.
The early days of Bitcoin did not count because the network was tiny, in development and it was accepted that Satoshi was in charge.  Those days are long gone.  
The only modern era forks I could find where 2 instances one was completely apolitical and was a client change that took [2 years to deprecate]( and the devs made sure no clients where in use this change had no impact in picking winners or losers on the network, and the other one the [Berkley DB error]( was a mistake and a surprise.  Again Fatal errors to the network are self-evident and the network will respond to correct the issue.
relevant thread on this issue 
All protocols eventually become fixed. TCP/IP as it exists today was defined in 1974 and has not changed 1980.  That was almost a decade before the WWW explosion.
Now no one can decide when Bitcoin reaches this stage, it simply becomes a physical reality that you can no longer modify the protocol via rip and replace and eventually people stop banging their heads against the immovable object.

@_date: 2016-02-12 22:33:40


I agree, but I would argue it was contentious precisely because its a hard fork, its a hard rule change.  Protocols like Litecoin and Bitcoin derive their security and stability from the difficulty of changing the rules.


Agree with this, I think however that only holds if threshold is 95%. But I am not sure we can reach that right now.  Some are just against  any hard rule change at this stage. If you look at the road map its clear, a hard rule change is a last resort.  So yes any hard rule change right now is contentious regardless if it comes from Core. There are plenty of people within core and outside who do not support a hard fork at this moment if it can be avoided.
As much as we see this as a technical issue the reality is a hard rule change is a political not technical issue. 
We still have a bit to go in development before we run out of options to scale.  So we find ourselves back at following the roadmap which relies on soft forks that can be adopted at the networks pace.


My understanding and experience is the blocklimit is causing problems for transactions that don't pay the appropriate fees. I have yet to run into issues with a transactions, but I pay fees for all my transactions.

Just my thoughts:
1. Take a look at some Chinese mining farm videos, Would not fly in North America with fire code, osha, local compliance laws, etc.
2. Cost of Labor
3. Local supply of cheap hardware.
4. Capital Control evasion; as someone mentioned, there is an incentive to even mine at loss, if you can take 5 million and turn it into a tax free, capital control free annuity, that you move anywhere in the world.
5. Available Financing: Not sure at this moment, but China had extremely favorable and liberal loan policies, 
6. *SPECULATION*. But I wonder how much Local Chines Demand for Bitcoin + The Chinese Firewall works against the rest of the world, by make block times outside propagate slower, so in order to keep up, we need to re-pool greater amount of hashing power to compete with China. It's not enough to setup your own small farm, if you get killed going through the firewall.  Chinese firewall works almost like a Psuedo-Block witholding attack, where you mine a longer chain not propagated to the rest of the network, and then you suprise it.
7. Electricity is at the bottom of the cost structure probably.

I think the reasonable way was proposed by the bitcoin roadmap, nothing presented has changed that.  The fact is that instead of reasoned technical debate on the merits you got a political solution which is the hard fork.
Its amazing that people still cannot see the hard fork for what it is a new network even if we are just claiming to change one number.
There is no hard fork as a solution to scale Bitcoin at this point.  It's not possible today, and it's not even possible as a long term strategy.  
Maybe there was a an ideal of one at some point but clearly all that is shown is that Hard Forking bitcoin is a political event that will not succeed. 
Even Adam Back is trying to go along an help with a fork of Bitcoin, and he is not making a progress.  Adam has made a good faith effort to include a hard fork code, but its not gonna happen. 
The reasonable thing is to let developers work on better solutions and stop pressuring them into the impossible.
The hard fork debate has served its purpose, it has shown that forking Bitcoin for a non-life threatening change is not reasonable at this point. Maybe at some point it will be.

my understanding is the relay network provides a level playing field for smaller miners who would otherwise be locked out.   
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:01:21
What this graph shows is that the block fee in USD dollars doubled because the price of Bitoin doubled. 
Imagine looking at this in term of the Venezuelan Bolivar? 
I believe the correct graph be to view Transaction Fees in BTC vs Total BTC transacted if you want to get an idea of what the actual burden transaction fees are on the network.
My prediction is that overall the % cost of a Bitcoin transaction fees remains flat or low vs Total Volume transacted.  However I believe that SPAM attacks and (we maybe even seeing one now) distort the fee pricing by moving lots of small bitcoin back and forth, and generating fees, which in total dont amount to much but still raise transaction fees, while not increasing the total amount of actual bitcoins circulated.  IE, Spam Attacks generate fees at a much greater ratio then actual bitcoin volume.  
The Following Overlays would provide better information
Transaction Volume (Total per Day)
Total Transaction Fees in BTC
Total output Volume in BTC
Total output with Change Outputs removed in BTC
The final data point is that Miners Cost as  a % of the Network continues to decline or at least its near its lowest point.
(A chart showing miners revenue as percentage of the transaction volume)  I am assuming this is priced in BTCs not in USD. Though blockchain didnt make that explicit. And its not clear if this includes miner reward or just transaction fees.
The argument that Bitcoin Demand will spike transaction costs may not necessarily hold it all depends on what the demand is for; Store Bitcoins in Cold Storage, vs Playing Dice Sites.

no one is advocating to keep the 1mb limit to create a fee market right now, This is mushing up the message that Pieter W. articulated sometime back and what he was saying was the opposite.
They will not make a technical change particularly a hard rule change for economic reasons, that is a bad precedent.  
 The technical matter is how to scale bitcoin, people need to work on that.  The economics is up to each participant, not some committee within Bitcoin.
I personally reject any argument that complains about fees, its pointless and a waste of time.  
If your business or economic model was built on zero fees you chose the wrong network because the rules and model of Bitcoin have been clear from day one, that Bitcoin was a network that uses fees to route transactions, and it is a fixed money supply, and the reduction is programmed in advance. There are no surprises here.

Exactly. Blocksize halving is a known factor and so is already priced into bitcoin.

You can see the same effect when a company makes an offer to purchase amother public company the market immediately prices in the outcome for both companies, either the likely hood of it going through or not. 
In this case the block halving is 100% certain. There is no doubt.

You can't measure consensus, it is self evident to the network.  
For example, Someone discovers a zero day exploit and we need to fork, or the network can be comprised. It is self evident to every participant. 
Consensus is not achieved by people meeting in a room.
Its progress and it maybe a way for Core to determine if there are people interested in their code, but Consensus can only be know after the fact. The entire network cut over to a new fork and it supported it.
Right now Bitcoin is still small maybe you can pull it off, but these is not a viable strategy moving forward.

Can we stop with the red herring that someone can Veto a hard fork or soft fork if we set the threshold to high.
Participants on the network who refuse to move forward with a hard rule change are not vetoing anything.  They are remaining on the network.
The purpose of having 90% plus is to the benefit of those forking, not to those who refuse to fork.  This idea that a small percentage can hold the network hostage is ridiculous.  
If you propose a rule change that will harm a participant economically why should they move forward? The inverse is Why are you participating in a network that requires you to change the rules in order to benefit economically?  
Why not launch your own network, oh wait nm...
It is incumbent on people who want to change the network, to convince themselves that they are providing an upgrade to the entire network to benefit of all participants on the network, if not they risk breaking it.
If you fork at a low % under the assumption that network supports your action you are wrong then you are doing economic harm to yourself, and maybe to those who refuse to move forward. 
It is clear that a hard fork to 2MB is incurring the real risk of spinning off an alternate protocol.   Do we want to go down this path?
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:19:47
This sound very reasonable if they have at minimum 12 months and 95%, additionally over that period it will gauge if there is in fact network wide support for a hard fork. 
I would not call the statement consensus, rather Bitcoin Core is offering what they believe to be code that the network as a whole can adopt.  Reality is we cannot know with a Hard Fork until after the fact or close to.

The rules of bitcoin have been pretty much in place for almost 6 years.  Core has changed nothing, so not sure how they can be accused of a forking the network?


The economics of the network are determined by the users primarily not by "Core".
What is there to be alarmed by?  Bitcoin works this way, Core did not set a block limit last week. Satoshi did almost six years ago.


People keep making this claim, and yet this assumes really that we never come up with any ways to scale bitcoin. Maybe that happens, but "Core" has only been scaling bitcoin for the last 6 years, and they have shown no evidence of stopping now.
If Bitcoin becomes a settlement system its because of its limited supply and the nature of Bitcoin.
To me a hard fork of Bitcoin is one, where you change the core properties of the protocol going forward and the system becomes less decentralized, and goes from being a limited and fully fungible asset, to some global paypal, run on Azure and Facebook. Sure I can transfer these P2P tokens for free but as long as it flows through Facebook servers.
However my scenario is also  as unlikely as your scenario in believing Roger Ver will become a central bank.
People need to stop accusing Core of changing Bitcoin, when the evidence points to opposite. Core is Bitcoin, its all the developers who have toiled in this from the beginning for free practically to keep Bitcoin operating as intended all the while growing and not comprising what Bitcoin is.  
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:35:21
Yes. Additionally  the concerns over blocksize bloat had more to do with sync times which today could exceed a day or two for a new node. I know that the new optimizations that core is rolling out (or did) have it down to 4-5 hours. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:26:43
Thanks for the PSA, this shows the divergence between people who understand bitcoin and people who don't.
As much as satoshi envisioned SPVs and Gavin et al believe that light nodes are the future and you only need enough decentralization to keep the big guys honest. The world we live in shows that big players will [collude]( all the [time]( and we are witnessing this play out in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's entire value proposition is underpinned by its decentralization.  It is not clear how it would regain it once lost.
If Bitcoin should have an inscription it should be:
*Trust No One. Hold Your Coins. Run Your Node.*
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:55:10
I am not sure where I said I don't want bitcoin to grow. 
Also, short term "demand destruction" (a flawed economic colloquialism IMHO) is inherent to Bitcoin since it cannot adjust supply in real-time. Neither the currency supply or blocksize or other parameters can ever grow in response to demand, so you will get normal cyclical periods of booms and bust.  The biggest problem with Bitcoin if that concerns you is the fixed supply. Its a much bigger issue for the egalitarians who want an unlimited Bitcoin.  But as long as Bitcoin remains the most immutable and decentralized resource and if increasing demand drives fee highers it will only insure a stronger bitcoin.
Additionally Bitcoin is Bitcoin and its up to users to determine what its use cases are, not for developers to try to shoehorn it into something. Bitcoins characteristics are set so I don't see how trying to create a fee-less Bitcoin is even possible. 
What you think as some long term phenomenon of "demand destruction", would be  short term situation of a rapidly growing bitcoin probably spurred by an external economic crisis and confidence that it will act as a safer store of value. Or perhaps even secondary layers to scale Bitcoin which enable new un-imagined services which can drive transactions higher.   
But in the end economic arguments are pointless, since in Bitcoin the individuals get to decide the economics, based on the existing rules, not a central committee. That's the beauty. So it really matters little what you or I perceive the economic limitations of bitcoin to be, since those have already been decided.
Bitcoin has been scaling and it will continue to scale.   Scaling is a function of technical development and what the network will adopt.  Even if Core wanted to prevent scaling, a false and absurd belief.  They can't prevent someone from offering up code that if economically beneficial to individual participants they would not adopt.
Scaling Bitcoin has nothing to do with avoiding fees you can try and build code specifically around reducing fee pressure but its pretty clear the network will not adopt it in that manner.

1. I don't believe even if Bitcoin is stuck at this blocksize it is failed.
No one can claim bitcoin failed or a success.   It is up to each participant to determine if Bitcoin meets their economic or social needs.  Anyone in the world can buy Bitcoin today, the blocksize is not a user limit.
2. So long as Bitcoin remains highly decentralized immutable store of value it will have a demand.  For me personally this type of service is only really needed for things that matter.  Do you want to secure a portion of your wealth in way that can travel with you or to your heirs undisturbed. Do you really need this type of system for low value transactions? When was the last time you use gold or your 401k to shop at newegg?  Either way Bitcoin is set it is up for  each user to determine how to apply it.  The rules are set use Bitcoin as you wish.
3.  It is irrelevant if fees go up or not.  Bitcoin development cannot be made solely on economic considerations. Who decides if fees or too high or too low. These are problems inherent to controlled money supplies, where you get lots people with Ivy league degrees to tell you what the best course of action is based on a bunch of backwards looking and spurious data sets.   If you come to the Bitcoin network you accept that the network protocol as constructed is going to determine the economic outcomes. If you dont like that they leave the protocol.  However you cannot change the protocol for economic reasons, that is a politically driven change, and Bitcoin will reject your attempts. 
4. I believe the network will find ways to scale it has been scaling for 7 years, the bitcoin network 7 years ago could not handle todays transaction volumes.  The blocksize may need to go up at some point I don't know.  However when it's time it will not be a contentious process.  If we have a hard fork, it may be a one time kitchen sink fork and then harden the protocol.  
The reality is Bitcoin will harden, and new layers will be added on whether its directly to Bitcoin or via other Crypto like Ethereum.
Then people will be free to innovate on their terms and eventually there will be as much drama over Bitcoin as there is over SMTP.
The Internet works because of multiple layers built on hardened protocols.  
Bitcoin will be the same.
@_date: 2016-02-11 05:17:20
I thought I was pretty clear in explaining the inconsistent logic of hard fork proponents.
Bitcoin is not a simple software platform that gets upgraded whenever the developers  or a clique of power brokers feel like.  Its a decentralized political system where the participants are organized by the existing rules.   For good or for bad the rules are set.
As such no participants have the ability to exert authority over other participants.   They think they do but they don't because only the network can upgrade itself.   
This is how protocols work it is why  TCP/IP is the same protocol that was developed in the 80's why SMTP is the same.  Why we still use IPV4. 
Again people can choose do whatever they want. I believe a 75% hard fork will be a failure.
Those who continue to view  Bitcoin as a development project ala linux or IE, are using the wrong framework to base their decisions on.
I would add that I never called Jeff ridiculous, the idea of the veto meme that is floating around is, and in fact have supported his BIP 102 proposal with the feedback that it use 95% and a longer adoption period.
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:41:34


That aspect sounds nicer but there is no way to determine, that is the risk of a hard fork.
But the approach sounds right, a long grace period and 95% should give them plenty of time to determine if they are making a sound economic decesion.
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:45:34
Lets see in 3 years Bitcoin is more well known than ever yet its a 1/3rd of its value from its peak.  Meanwhile the world is on fire and at the moment there was a glimmer that people may turn to bitcoin as a safety net, some developers decided now is the time to push a contentious fork of Bitcoin and show that Bitcoin is not an immutable store of value, but potentially subject to the same flaws that have corrupted the existing financial system.
But keep believing that somehow raising the blocklimit will mean more users.
There is nothing preventing anyone from buying more bitcoin.  The blocklimit is not a user limit.

I agree, Bitcoin will welcome a fork if it there is no alternative except death.  But if people think bitcoin is going to break because of the blocksize they have already been proven wrong. Bitcoin works, it was always engineered to deal with a blocklimit.  There are still improvements being made, and right now the biggest issues are wallets that are not calculating fees.

What is the TPS of a Physical U.S. Dollar, or Euro Dollar?
TPS means nothing and it was a mistake of Satoshi to bring it up in the early days.
Trying to engineer the network around a meaningless number is pointless in IMHO.
Why should TPS be more important than say engineering privacy, security or other important features?
Who gets to determine what is the right TPS?
The fact is Bitcoin is built around confirmations and priority not around raw TPS.  Retail payments systems need to process TPS and it is about measuring peak throughput.  VISA does not care if you are buying a latte at starbucks or a new model S, it will take everything it can.  Bitcoin was not even engineered that way because its a system built so solve an information theory problem. Bitcoin is a network where every transaction has to be written over many times anyways because everyone gets a copy.  Imagine if VISA had to broadcast every retail transaction back to every POS terminal in the world. 
If  a transaction is not a priority for confirmation, you could wait days for it to reach all your  confirmation needs. What if you are transferring Bitcoins to your child's college account.  That they will not use for another decade, does it really matter when the transaction is confirmed.
Bitcoin has many more layers to go, some already exist in the form of external third parties like Coinbase or Bitpay. The bad thing is you need to trust them on certain transactions, you lose privacy, and you still are operating under the same politcal rules. But they are a shorterm gap, where you still get to determine if the transaction is a low priority one.  Overtime Bitcoin will engineer the tools to make systems like coinbase and bitpay less important or not needed at all.
The biggest mistake many are making is to allow Bitcoin to be compared to VISA. Bitcoin is a political system with its own currency.   A more appropraite comparison is Bitcoin to the Euro Banking system.  Lets start there and see how far we can go.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:28:53
IMHO, Brian's point of view is grounded in that Decentralization is an abstraction. He believes as many "scale or Die" proponents that Bitcoins intrinsic value is tied to consumer demand.   They believe they need to get the product to the people.   
So what they need is a team that will deliver this, Bitcoin to them is a software project that needs "big boy" leadership. Which of course completely misses the point of Bitcoin as new political system which is paradoxically anti-political and resistant to lobbying and has no leadership. 
In fact Bitcoin is moving to a stage where the protocol is "cooling"  what is needed is even higher orders of technical thinking, to continue to squeeze value out of a protocol, not political hacks to complex technical solutions.

This will be the biggest test of bitcoin and frankly a break in consensus maybe a very expensive lesson for bitcoin.
totally agree that those hard pressed to break away to get a 1mb increase cannot see the forest from the tree.  
It's ridiculous to argue that transaction limits are a problem, when people are not even holding bitcoin in a significant quantity.  
However this will be a necessary process.
Either bitcoin is a operational decentralized system which can fend off attacks, or its a flawed project that requires a centralized development team or benevolent dictator to hard fork it every few years and such will never deliver as a payment system or a decentralized immutable store of value.

Really? 


This is real risk, I believe there already some who are trying to work directly with miners to pay for priority.  But it is part of the existing game theory and understood by participants.


 Fail to see this scenario. A small block limit, means anyone can run a node, and host their own keys.   The idea that Bitcoin transactions will rise to  some absurd unit where only the rich can cover the fees is ridiculous since the network will never pay for that level of security.
Additionally  transactions fee are time vs priority. People willing to wait can pay less to have their transactions confirmed. Maybe the Rockfellers will get their million dollar transfers confirmed with in the first blocks and the rest off us will make to do with waiting a few extra hours. The limit here is poor wallet development.
Bitcoin is permissions less, the idea that it will become some clique owned by a dynasty of families is a little far fetched.  
The use of offchain companies like bitcoin has nothing to do with transaction fees and has everything to do with the complexity of Bitcoin, which will not be resolved by blocksize.




Doesn't matter its how these network evolve. Look at other protocols evolve and they use extension, but they always work to maintain forward compatibility it is the nature of working with decentralized networks.  This is not some centralized rule its just a reality.
Adoption is adoption, the network will evaluate the code if its not worth the risk it will be rejected. But where should a developer spend his time creating solutions that work within the existing rules, or hire a PR firm lobby the network in another direction.
I don't disagree at all with Gavin that a benevolent dictator is the best form of Government, saves on the need for lobbying.  But let me know when you find one and convince the rest of us to go along with it.

Core and block stream does not support  a contentious fork of bitcoin unlike other "bitcoin" companies.
 If you are using bitcoin today and don't agree with the rules that have been in place for years. Why are you here? Clearly you are losing money if your expectation is that to get a return is by coordinating individual users to agree to your rule changes.
No one can impose anything and the core devs who work on core who outnumber blocks team devs cannot impose anything.
So either bitcoin works or its a flawed system that requires a centralized team to fork it every few years to avoid a catastrophe,  that meme is how you get a centralized bitcoin owned by goldman sachs.
Right now the only way to take over bitcoin is via mining which if you go to far will harm bitcoin, via. A hard fork or by paying current bitcoin holders a ton of money to monpolize bitcoin .
You cannot take over bitcoin via voluntary soft forks that people can choose not to implement

Agree I would hope we don't add in a secondary system, that could be gamed or introduce uknown risks.

1. No one is deliberately growing the fee, market. For Example the blocksize is not going down, the recommend fee in Bitcoin Core is not being played with.  And Developers are actively working to increasing the transaction capacity of the network which will permit more transactions.
2. What is happening is that many people, developers, miners and average users feel technical decisions should not be driven by economic changes in the Bitcoin ecosystem. There are many variables, arbitrary ones in bitcoin, that affect the economics and utility of the network. To focus on Bitcoin transactions fees over others is in it of itself a religious belief.  Why keep Bitcoin Supply fixed, why have 10 minute block times, why did we have the transaction fees calculated in the manner they are, on and on. 
The concept of Bitcoin as an immutable decentralized network that is free from political and centralizing influences. As much as many may feel that fee increases, which have not occurred yet, may affect adoption, the way bitcoin works there is no one that can make that decision or decide what is the correct fee or how to make that change.   Only (as kooky) as it sounds can the Network decide this. 
Additionally the logic that is used to chase this imaginary monster is the same logic that Central bankers use to drive economies.  So even if you really really want to lower fees, the reality is Bitcoin was built to reject this thinking. Just look at the bloody noses of very influential people in Bitcoin that really want to tackle this fee monster and have failed.
So I for one as a perversely contrarian thinker actually believe, that Bitcoins continued rejection of all politics all sense of manipulation, will actually drive Bitcoin prices higher, and drive adoption. Because when you sit down and think to yourself, where could I put away some money for safety or long term that could survive pretty much any catastrophe short of total nuclear winter and is free from the grasp of greedy men, there are few places, and Bitcoin offers some major advantages over others.    
The fact is that many of the "adoption" drives for bitcoin are really illusions,  masquerading as existing financial services with a bitcoin logo. The Shift card as cool as it is really makes no economic sense.  Merchants don't benefit, you are incurring a taxable event every time you use the card, and you are paying fees, and spending money which has a much greater long term return, than they current stuff you spend it on.  The equivalent is  taking money from your 401k to buy lunch.   It's great and maybe you feel you are growing bitcoin, but in all honesty I believe it does little for Bitcoin adoption.  I like it and kudos to Coinbase for rolling it out.  Thats the beauty of Bitcoin, follow your grove.
Now when it comes to Bitcoins role in the world, the reality is no one can decide it, the community cannot decide to pivot one way or the other. The same way the people who developed TCP/IP didnt set to automatically build a network to support Netflix or Youtube.  
The priority for Bitcoin is to be the best it can be, the rest is up to the world of seeing if it actually needs, Bitcoin. Hey maybe in the end we don't.
There is a serious mistake in the Silicon Valley approach to thinking Bitcoin is some beta software that needs to hit a numbers target and just needs to right engineers to get the job done or the world is going to write it off. Already you hear about how much some VCs are investing in Ethereum startups. Great.  Bitcoin is not going to die as long it does what it does, as long as developers continue to roll out code, and the network adopts it.  Ethereums growth will drive Bitcoin.   Ethereum is an operating system, bitcoin is a core protocol.  
The experiment of Ethereum was only made possible because the decentralized nature of Bitcoin allowed them crowd fund an alternative system using fungible un-censor-able asset like Bitcoin.  Ethereum could not have been funded with U.S. dollars.
So Bitcoin is already an established political system which underpins a thriving and growing crypto world. It is these future services that will drive Bitcoin adoption. Not using your shift card at the gas station.  
When the world can order a decentralized Uber service, or set up a longterm funding account that will transfer to their heirs bypassing all regulatory obstacles, people will come to use these systems, and Bitcoin will remain the anchor.   
There is no winner take all here, we are building a new world it will take decades.

Great point.
The threat of Bitcoin splitting is what forces everyone to use the existing rules, and what keeps bad actors honest.
If Majority rules was the case, Bitcoin would have forked many times, but everyone knows its not, even 75% is irrelevant, because it cannot capture the true percentage of people who will support an alternate fork, or just abandon the network all together.
Bitcoins inability to fork is a positive not a failure, it shows that Bitcoin may truly be the first man made value system that is idiot proof, and immune to political theft.
The reality is once the Blocksize became part of the hard rules, it was fait acompli, and we now have to deal with and accept this fact and we will need to work around it. Or reach a point where the network (not just miners) realize that we must fork, we are not there yet.
One thing people need to understand is that the Blocksize debate, or any hard rule change is not a technical debate, it is a political debate. The technical part is clear.  The problem is politically you need lobby the network to come along. This is why I believe it is always going to be a lost cause and the only way to "win" is eventually devolve into all the same political tactics we see in the real world, corruption, back room deals, threat of force, extortion, ad-hominen attacks etc.
Contrast the current hard fork debate with a hypothetical situation where someone discovers a zero day bug in the bitcoin protocol. This would be a pretty clear technical event where the risk is Bitcoin fails today, or we move to a new Bitcoin network where the bug is eliminated.  
I wrote something similar to Meni on [Why a Hard Fork will be fought]( and I am convinced more than ever that a Hard Fork of Bitcoin is not going to happen and even if it does it will fail, spectacularly. 
And in fact it would be a positive event.

Bitcoin is a political system, people need to understand when they come to Bitcoin they are participating in alternative economic system.
It's low hanging fruit to push bitcoin vs VISA or some other meme, but really 90% of the problem in Bitcoin is the misunderstanding that Bitcoin is far beyond a way to to transfer value.
This is why people do not grasp that Hard Forks, are not sofware changes but political changes, and why Bitcoin TPS is not relevant. No one is trying to determine what is the TPS of a physical U.S Dollar. It's not measurable.

You are correct, this will be the result.  The idea Bitcoin price will skyrocket because after 7 years of debate, a couple of developers and some deep pocket VC companies convinced 3 mining pools to fork bitcoin would signal that Bitcoin is now scaling, is ludicrous.
However the light at the end of the tunnel I believe, would be if a contetious fork is attempted, we may get a new PoW fork Bitcoin and this would very interesting, and exciting.
Frankly I see little value in a Bitcoin that's only method of scaling is for developers to spend all their time on the campaign trail for a block increase.  
I believe Gavin and Jeff have spent more time on Blog Posts, then actual coding, and that says a lot.  Not to diminsh their contribution but it shows why hard forking is a waste of time.
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:37:42
You were pretty clear why you would not hard fork Litecoin a few years ago, why do you feel a hard fork of Bitcoin orders of magnitude more complex and larger in terms of network scale and depth can be done even in the next 12 months?
I still see no long term plan of how hard forks will be a functional part of bitcoin development, that don't introduce tremendous risks.  To simply do a one time hard fork, that offers little benefit to the entire bitcoin network, IMHO is very short sighted.  I originally thought a 2mb fork would be useful, however the more I have studied the matter the more I come to the conclusion that in fact a hard fork as most envision of an upgrade at some set date, and cutover is almost impossible.   
What Core cannot risk, is to attempt a hard fork that fails, I think that would be a bad event for the Core team.  Bitcoin will continue just fine.
I also think it's a mistake to present core vs classic or vice versa. Let's be frank if you were locked in a room with only the code to study that is being presented by core or classic who would you choose?  If you think switching to classic is in your best interest you should do it. But you know it is not. As such there is no nuclear option of choosing classic, because you will never get a commitment from the network.
What is with the recurring push for artificial timelines, (Hearn, Armstrong, Gavin, et al,) is coming from?  You previously were against timelines, now you seem to be shifting to requiring a 2mb upgrade ASAP, what is ASAP?
Lets be honest the primary driver of the fork is Bitcoin companies that are desperate to rollout large user base services and they cannot do it.  They view Bitcoin like internet bandwidth or storage space, it just needs to scale and they want to hire the guy who is going to give them what they want and centralization doesn't bother them because they are already centralized. These companies are psuedo-banks or beholden to regulators or investors. So the concept of a currency that is truly decentralized is more of an abstraction to them then a reality.
IMHO Bitcoin offers little value to them in the present form, they bought in with the belief they could be an on-ramp to compete with existing financial services, except they failed to understand that Bitcoin is a political system first with its own economy and participants.  These companies need to realize that the approaches that work in centralized software projects will set them up for failure in Bitcoin.
I truly value your input, I think you have always shown to be one of the clearer thinkers in the crypto space who understands that these systems are more than just software projects.

I don't believe it works to well in open liquid markets, and it doesn't work to well in open liquid markets, underpinned by an open source protocol like Bitcoin that is completely permission-less.
You can't build a big enough misinformation store to get the tipping point of a destabilizing event, if that was the case it would've happened early on.

I am not willing to do anything, I willing to accept the reality of Bitcoin and how it operates.
The problem with hard fork first proponents is they fail to understand Bitcoin.
People who focus on developing code and presenting it to the network in a non-contentious manner which it can adopt it's own pace, are spending their time constructively.
Everyone else is tilting at windmills.  The proof is the amount of hours Gavin, Jeff and company have spent on non-technical pursuits under order to just get 1 line of code changed.
They are no closer to get this change through than they were 6 years ago.

That argument is balanced and I can find no one who disagree with the goal of on-boarding the world to bitcoin.  
The problem right now is how do you do it in a manner the system will accept and will do so without compromising the system.  In fact I believe right now Bitcoin has reached a level of size that it cannot be compromised anyways. So really it comes down to offering scaling solutions that will get adopted by the network.
So what is your proposal to achieve it?  So far the only proposal I have seen which as remote chance of being adopted by the network and increasing more throughput is seg-wit.  
Maybe the 2mb block increase has a shot, but right now I don't see it happening.

You are quoting Satoshi on a hypothetical which does not exist, when he clearly stated before that Bitcoin is not practical for micro-transactions.
The reason bitcoin will always be expensive vs legacy networks is because you are paying for Decentralization and immutability, you require N computers to secure you transaction and there is a cost to that security.  The cost of having an uncensored, decentralized consensus system verify your transactions in an immutable storage system, it orders of magnitude more expensive than a simple centralized database.
Now you can expand on the societal impact of one system vs the other, but clearly Bitcoin's solution to transaction verification vs VISA is more expensive and less efficient than VISAs. But VISA is Payment system, and Bitcoin is a Political system.
So the correct comparison is what is the cost to verify a transaction in the U.S. Economy vs the Bitcoin Economy and this is the mistake many people make.
What level of societal cost is needed to verify the U.S. Dollar vs Bitcoin Dollar.
Bitcoin economics and Bitcoin itself is not structured to support micro-transactions ala a Points nework or even VISA.
Bitcoin will eventually support future layers that may enable microtransactions.

He's half-right.  There is no such thing a absolute privacy in our societies, we have a social contract where if due process is met and the society has a need to protect itself you need to waive that right.
However what Comey wants is a world where due process is  an automated system that allows blanket suspensions of privacy ad-infinitum. So you never even get to exercise that right in the first place.  
His backdoor isn't a fire key used in emergencies, its an open pass to go in whenever needed and ready your email, or perpetually collect data on you. 
If the government had been more credible in some of its behavior in the past perhaps backdoor encryption, a pointless exercise could be discussed.  But they are not arguing from the moral high ground.

Bitcoin RBF addresses, mistaken payments even theft, it caught early on. also LN and such will give greater control to downstream payments.
Blochain tech would be useless if there was a mechanism that bypassed consensus to reorg the chain or reverse transactions that have been "settled" or a deep.
This is the continued clash of Blockchain world vs a world drive by elitists/oligarchs who write rules that can never apply to them.  
Ethereum reorg can be done by Bitcoin or any consensus based ledger, if the network wants to reorg it can, however it requires the entire network or practically the entire network.  Which sets a very high hurdle and of course there are consequences, people are free to leave, or not participate.
What the author wants, and I am sure what his clients want is to make sure, that when push comes to shove the 5% or 1% can still control the ledger and still force evryone else to go along with what ever they dictate.
good luck.

Actually its much worse for the Forkers in Bitcoin. In Ethereum the network was forced to fork, close to 90% of the network had to upgrade, and ETC was a result of people not upgrading and new entrants who wanted to exploit the market opp. So the split coin was result of doing nothing.
IN the case of Bitcoin, by not forking the pressure is on the pro-fork crowd to get the entire network to fork. Which is what they have been trying for 3+ years to spectacular failure.

The stress test just made Bitcoin stronger, just like these DoS and exploit attacks will do for ethereum.  Nature of Open source P2P networks.
@_date: 2016-09-26 12:15:13
This attack like the similar attacks on Bitcoins are either interested parties stress testing the systems, or people who like to burn money, because all that happens is the network responds with improvements.
Ethereum dev response has been pretty impressive.

if people can sabatoge bitcoin, then its never going to be much anyways. 
The fact that already someone discovered the attempt and its been brought to light shows just how resilient bitcoin is.
Bitcoin is like a rogue nation state.  Nation States don't just pop into the world without repercussions.
Attempting to use one or several countries legal systems to somehow shield bitcoin from attacks would actually weaken it.
Just have to see how far it can go.
@_date: 2016-09-22 19:46:07
Kudos to the Ethereum team for resolving the attack pretty quickly.  Bitcoin had many issues in the first few years to be ironed out, and we have suffered our share of DoS Attacks, coming stronger out if it.
Brian Armstrong is wrong however that Ethereum scales, no P2P currency system currently has a viable scaling model. Not Bitcoin, Not Ethereum.  Vitalik like the core team is upfront about the serious scaling issues facing Ethereum just like Bitcoin. There is no easy way to scale an O(n) networks (unless you are Roger Ver) because its  a math problem.  Every Node adds to the scaling problem.   The reality brute technology improvements will be the only way to scale these networks in many instances.
Ethereum and Bitcoin will both learn from each other, people need to lighten up.

Great idea. This only works, however if you can acquire this without any compliance. 
This will be a major test of of Article 1. Section 8.  Since you are potentially coining money.

If you want a more centrally managed project that is what Ethereum is for. Bitcoin and the community is built up around rabid decentralization.  Its is the anchor to the cryptostate.
So Bitcoin will never work with a charismatic leader, its never going to be the amazing tesla, ipad innovation everyone wants.
It is a decentralized currency, that has been rock solid and stable for closing in on a DECADE.
That is Bitcoin.

Also typically, companies that sink R&amp;D in the order of a $100 million dollars expect some ROI on that, even a company with an ROI of 10% would expect 10 million return per annum, with a 10% net Income that's a $100 million dollar business.

What's amazing is so far not a single physical proof has been presented by anyone that any of these companies have produced anything tangible, or have any clients except other shell companies.

No he received actual payments from the ATO is my understanding as part of a program to promote R&amp;D and tech development in Australia. 
Basically for every dollar you spend you get a % back rebate by the ATO.
The investigation he is under is by the ATO for the monies paid out by the government. At least this is how I understand it. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:05:49
The last point in the leak transcript they are specifically requestin an immediate release of 20% of the rebate about 5 million.  I see nowhere that any of these entities paid any monies in taxes since none showed any net income.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:26:38

$100 million dollar investment is no chump change, where did the $100 million come from or was it even spent?
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:22:20
They have reported claiming $54 million on tax credits/rebates. Its still not clear if these payouts are a % of tax collected, which would imply that Craig oversaw or run a company that Generatef 100s of millions or maybe billions in revenue?

Gavin is not the evil CIA man everyone wants to pain him as.  He's as a flawed as everyone else including probably Team Satoshi.
It remains to be seen who Craig Wright is, he is someone that knows something about Bitcoin's early days, and knew enough about Cryptography to possibly trick Gavin

There is no evidence anywhere that Craig Wright has ever produced any software code. Which is interesting.  It maybe he has, but there was plenty of digging done 5 months ago including published papers of his which where mostly psuedo nonesnes. 
One thing that is interesting is that Craig Wright does not have anything in has past nor Does Dave Kleiman that would indicate they knew enough to create bitcoin. Certainly they did not have the backgrounds or pedigrees that people like Hal Finney, Adam Back, Nick Szabo, and Peter Todd, Wei Dai, and many others, including the fact that they have published papers, works and community interactions.
Still its possible, many great inventions are done by amateurs who know enough but not enough to prevent them from attempting the impossible.
What is most interesting is What Does Craig Wright know or convey socially the convinced Matonis and Gavin that he was Satoshi.
The personal details are most curious.

I believe Satoshi was a team of people it's much easier to behave disciplined within an organized structure.
You are right, even stand alone devs are personally invested in their projects. Look at  he didn't just send one tweet and disappear, or the history of other founders. Satoshi's ability to walk away is pretty impressive.
Testnet or not the thoroughness with which Satoshi has covered his tracks is pretty unprecedented in modern web history.
I think even Satoshi cannot prove he is Satoshi at this point.
Satoshi behavior is more consistent with that of structured organization, than a single person.
