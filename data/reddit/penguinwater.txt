As an ardent BTC supporter, I’ll say that this type of post is soooooo 2017.
Focus on the strengths and growth of the crypto you support. Give little attention those who try to detract from it.

Why is that video player such shit?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:13:55
What’s your point? Currently it exists as a BCH soapbox. When it began doesn’t change what it has become. A conversation against BTC. Sad.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:16:33
You’re using a high degree of speculation there, friend.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:06:59
Mmmmm. No. That’s an apologist take on it.
As long as Ver promotes it as the real bitcoin people should fight tooth and nail.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:36:15
Saying that BCH is the real bitcoin is false. It’s false to the tune of $183 billion dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:43:35
Other than when he blathers on about BCash being bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:11:29
As soon as Ver agrees to do the same. But as long as he uses bitcoin.com to promote BCH as bitcoin, he is trying to tear down bitcoin.

I’m not squatting on another currency’s ticker symbol. You’re argument is invalid.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:12:45
That’s a stupid remark. Truly.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:26:33
Not to mention, bch’s biggest gathering places are to squat on r/BTC and bitcoin.com to promote their crypto master race bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:04:14
I’m glad core doesn’t subscribe to knee-jerk stopgaps.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:09:55
Loser Ver isn’t promoting those as bitcoin. Duh!
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:45:09
Let’s hope the coming AI doesn’t scrape reddit looking for intelligence. Or were all doomed.

Look everyone. User 0932313521d3finitelyn0tab0t is projecting.

It’s not a currency... Yet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:16:28
You’re using a high degree of speculation there, friend.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:12:16
Yet the main advocates for BCash gather at r/btc to spout off. Go figure.
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:47:36
Are you on drugs?
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:50:02
Go away with your false equivalencies.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:08:30
It’s not an argument over the name. It’s over Ver falsely promoting it as bitcoin. I’d be glad to join a class action lawsuit over it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:52:54
That was a ham fisted assumption.
The smaller block size was meant to keep the network from being spammed. Not the place to start cludging in scaling hopes. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:22:02
The wallet is a bitcoin.com product which, as an entity, takes every opportunity to undermine bitcoin and try to falsely promote bCash and the real bitcoin. I don’t see the problem in criticizing the wallet as part of a tainted ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:57:49
And not to fan the flames of people willing to vilify the core developers based on FUD and misinformation.
In any battle between developers and economic interests, I personally will side with the developers. Just as in a battle between an artist and a record label, I would side with the artist.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:47:49
Having a small group of deep pocketed people behind closed doors making a decision to increase the blocksize without consulting the developers is in itself an act of centralization.
The larger block size would do little to scale bitcoin in the way it needs to in time. (Bandaid) and it’s been stated that smaller blocksize was intended to avoid the network from being spammed.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:58:45
I’m still waiting for them to release the forked bCash so I can sell it. What’s the holdup?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:00:05
Very generous of you!
Perhaps consider the Organization for Autism Research. 
They focus on directing money to finding treatments and cures for Autism.
Have fun with this act of giving. Feels good.

Two of the most punchable faces on the planet.
And holy shit. If you’re vying to be legitimate, the last person you align with is Alex Jones. Sad.
Birds of a feather drink colloidal silver together, I guess.

The difference could be the concensus in the community which does not exist in the case of BCH.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:15:21
Yet, here you are.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:30:47
I was fooled.

I don’t spend time on message boards for things I deride as gimmicks. You choose in life whether you stand for things or against things. Your choice.
If you get bent out of shape over my comment, I simply don’t know what to tell you.

That one has incredibly high fees or inaccurate buy/sell prices. I went to use it the other day and noped the fuck out once I saw the cost difference vs an exchange.
