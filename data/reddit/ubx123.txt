Price according to MtGox is now at $190. All my known data sites are currently down or just displaying old information. All those people who jumped on as it rose and made money are now hopping off ASAP.

I don't mind him giving away money, but he could of done it via PM or some other private means (like people usually do when giving away money), not publicly let everyone know how rich he is, and how we should all be jealous of him.

He isn't being generous, go look at the thread where he refuses to give money to someone and then all people buy him gold like he's some sort of hero.

This is exactly what is happening. The price right now (MtGox) is $197. A lot of people are panicking trying to sell. This isn't some sort of organized attack, at least from my perspective here.

Not really. Going around giving people sums of money like that and lapping up all the attention isn't exactly the proper way to give money is it?

He can do whatever he wants with it, doesn't make him any less of a prick.

If you don't want to see it, fine. The fact is this guy is doing it purely for attention, and is being a dick about it. His username is "bitcoinbillionaire" for fucks sake.

"Then yesterday I see a guy tip someone more in dollar value than the amount of my remaining school debt"
I think I saw what you mean. I hate it when people do stuff like that, flaunting wealth around because they can. If I could I'd punch him in the face.
Hope you get everything sorted

"Kind of a dick"?
He's a complete and utter prick, the only reason he's been giving away money is because he wants attention. He's wasted all that money that could of gone to good causes, and then people are buying him gold? What the fuck.
