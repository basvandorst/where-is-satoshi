Are you surprised that this entire forum is propaganda? 95% of bitcoins are being held by speculators, who want as much good news out there as possible to raise the value.
The remaining 5% is split between frothing-at-the-mouth teens who got 1 bitcoin 5 years ago and now think they're a millionaire, and people that actually wish to use an anonymous crypto currency
Three words dude: PUMP AND DUMP

First *proven* bitcoin related nerd suicide.
Also, bitcoin collapses and David Fincher makes another blockbuster which paints the Winklevii in an unflattering manner.

Apple isn't the only company to use USD, or even account for the majority of USD transactions. The fear here is that A.) SR accounted for a large portion of bitcoin transactions and B.) if SR can go down than other deep web sites that use bitcoin can also go down, lessening the value of the currency as it's main use is anonymous (for a reason) transactions.

I mean, I come here just for the laughs. Reading bozos talk about investing their life savings in imaginary internet money is pretty damn hilarious.
