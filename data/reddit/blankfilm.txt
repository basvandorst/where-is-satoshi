Wow, that's a very country specific request to make, and is probably unreasonable to ask of a cryptocurrency tracking app to do, because of the complex tax laws in each country (and even state, in the US). This app is not meant to help with your tax declarations.
You should probably use a German tax app that can handle your crypto investments as well, and not the other way around.

Unlikely, but they did, which indicates their tests are not thorough enough.

What makes you think Bitcoin won't be alive centuries from now?
We have and use software built decades ago, when the technology was actually invented, that still works, gets updates, and is used by millions of people today.
That might still be true centuries from now for Bitcoin, or any popular software today. We just can't say since everything about this is so new.

Wow, these issues are concerning.
I was considering getting the Nano to replace my TREZOR, but I'll rather hold off until they have a stable system.

Thanks, you convinced me to stay with Trezor for the foreseeable future.
These issues are unacceptable for a retail product.

Sweet release

I hate v.reddit so much, and Imgur has become a shadow of its former self, of what used to be dead simple and unintrusive media hosting and sharing.
The time is ripe for a "disruptor" in the space to actually innovate (figure out a sustainable business model, for one; and hey, we have cryptocurrencies now hhmm), while maintaining a simple UI indefinitely.
Maciej Cegłowski ([Pinboard]( Colin Percival ([Tarsnap]( and others that share their design ideals, I'm looking at you to save us.
