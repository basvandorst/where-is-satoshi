Well I think it's reasonable to pay at least 50% in taxes as long as we have the quality of life that we do. So I think we should pay alot more than that, and that you should too. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:39:12
So why are you here if you're not onboard with the ideology? Ahhh, its all about the $$ at the end of the day isn't it?? 
Fuckwad.

Your brother unfortunately sounds like he idolized the material goods far more than his own life. Even more unfortunate is had he actually cashed in $50M, he would have still been as miserable, possibly even worse off. Damaging relationships with family and hurting those that he loved simply b/c his love was for the material and not for self or others. 
I'm deeply sorry for you and your families loss. Its never easy, despite knowing that it was a stupid decision.

Ahhh so you see the point now. Just b.c you believe 20% sounds reasonable, doesnt mean that its reasonable to all. Understand? 
20% is unacceptable, yet you think 50% would be unacceptable. The Revolutionary War was fought over a 3% tax, and yet you nanny-state loving, socialist fucks want more taxes all the time. Taxes should be ABSOLUTELY minimal, and only outlined for specific things, gains in our own profits not being one of them.

This guy. Lol... nanny-state loves it's super slaves.

This is awesome news. And to add to it, my transactions are going through faster than they ever have. Core doesnt seem to be stalling payments. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:24:38
We'll see what the Feds have to say about this. Doubt it passes sentate 
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:04:06
Which is the suspicious part in my opinion. If he's trying to be dramatic, then there's something more driving his intentions. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:09:18
Cognitive dissonance dude. Look it up. You reek of it. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:36:52
That piece was the worst bit of bullshit I've ever read. I feel like I just read something from a Government shill in the Transportation Authority trying to stop the onslaught of emails he gets from citizens critically thinking and asking 'why' its acceptable to not have seatbelts for some, and not acceptable for others.
Please, next time try taking 5 seconds to read what it is you actually searched for before posting it as 'evidence' to a false point. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:20:20
I guess you didn't see the video in question. Try clicking the link of the post before responding again. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:22:49
And so this is the reason behind the avocation for BU, correct? 
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:46:43
Everything you said is disproved by the very video we just watched. What are you arguing about?
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:25:12
I love how you emphasized **42 hours a week**, as if that were some insurmountable and ungodly amount of hours to work. 
Please dont ever come to America then, you would hate your life.

1. Bottleneck/more control of internet
2. 256 AES Encryption being hacked. 
3. Infrastructure wipe out. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:57:54
I think you have bigger issues than losing your bitcoin. Somebody is obviously watching you very closely. Hence knowing about the transfer so quickly. 
Better do a clean sweep of your system. Update lose ends on apps. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:58:54
Doesn't matter. The intention for control/dominance over the majority for self benefit. That's why core has to be seperate from mining. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:33:45
Worried about your Internet points?
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:16:45
So the Government gives me a ticket for not wearing a seat belt, but an entire bus is built without them and that's okay? Fucking Statists logic. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:00:10
Beyond just the content which doesn't deserve a response too, the actual 'journalism' (or lack thereof) is what we should be talking about here. Is this guy a children's book author??
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:15:38
Yea dude, wtf are you using that villainous bank for anyways??
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:25:54
They wouldn't have to buy it, just accept it as a form of payment. Pay your mortgage, car payment, or loans with Bitcoin, and bc of it's constant rise in price, most would see it as beneficial.
But at that point it might signify BCs importance and people would refrain from using BC. This is when large institutions would offer a discount for using BC. Most at that point would pay with BC.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:59:17
How would you recommend one stay secure when trying to exchange it? Regardless of where you go, don't you share your BTC private key regardless to acquire BCH? 
This strikes me as a quick easy scam, and I'm surprised this hasnt already made the headlines. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:25:46
ANy online wallets you'd recommend as a 2nd option? Any safe ones?
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:36:03
I've currently got my BTC on paper wallet with private keys. Which is why I'm concerned with sharing the key, as I didnt anticipate changing it. However, it looks like is suggesting that I move my BTC to a new wallet address, then take that private and access BCH with it, then it sounds like I should then move my BTC back to a paper wallet for safe keeping. 
Is this accurate gents?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:35:35
Riches and bitches! 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:27:07
It's already taxed as an asset, which is subject to capital gains tax. But totally agree, this is not a good thing for Bitcoin as a currency, and seems like a way for globalists to crash the BC community, or at least the least, high jack it. NOt good. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:38:17


That's partially what I'm scared of. I dont want to learn by losing my valued BTC! Thanks for the inisght coinjaf. :)

Bullshit... nobody just drops "conspiracy to commit murder" charges. 
You guys stop getting your news from MSNBC. 
How did this subreddit get hijacked by statist fan boys?

Great response. Thanks for the great information.

"Thinking population" is the part we're missing. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:49:46
The point is they dont drop it unless they know it doesnt have merit. They would of pursued the charges if it were legit. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:09:58
Yep. Money rules politics. You don't believe the Rockefellers or The Rothschilds have any fear of government do You?

Who is the good-doer in Congress running this initiative then? Good guy bankers that own congress? 
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:31:25
Yes I also agree. But money is about trust, nothing more and the bankers know that. Bitcoin could easily become state-owned, and consumers would be just as happy with cash they currently 'trust'
