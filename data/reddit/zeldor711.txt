I swear people were acting less panicked at 2.8k to 1.7k then they are now from 15k to 10k.

Well we're back now so no need to worry
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:46:09
Wow how much did you buy?
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:45:34
If the price corrects

Don't you need to be 18 to transfer (sell) into fiat on coinbase?

I don't see Bitcoin giving me a job anytime soon...

Somehow for me searching BTC USD doesn't work but btcusd does

I would have probably sold by now if my age did not prevent me from verifying a Coinbase account xD.

I think I misinterpreted your comment slightly, that was exactly what I was trying to query
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:27:13
That implies that bitcoin was once worth 0

Real question is are you referring to Cambridge or Oxford?

I can see it now... people buy bitcoin to get equal coins from the hard fork. They then sell their new coins and buy even more bitcoin further driving up the price

But if a hard fork snaps then it could end up pinging back and stabbing you.
