Someone tell me how this is good for bitcoin.

I personally wouldn't risk it. Better to hold on to the money until a much more reputable service surfaces than take a chance at losing everything.

I don't know how anyone can say bitcoin isn't a bubble at this point. It's no longer usable as a currency, meaning it's just a digital stock not attached to anything other than it's own hype. However, there's no harm in making short term profit off of it as long as you make sure to cash out early.
