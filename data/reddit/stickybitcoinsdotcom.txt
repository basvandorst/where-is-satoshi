Het AcidAlchamy. Thank you for your purchase. The stickers are shipped first thing next morning. Our database showed that you've attempted to pay with Bitcoin, but cancelled. Was the Bitcoin Payment Gateway not function properly? I appreciate your feedback.

These are stickers(21mm) that can be attached to the back of your  coins.
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:31:55
Thank you for your positive feedback. We are going to look into fixing this.

Thank you for your feedback. 
But no worries madam/sir. The practice of coinvertisement is pretty populair in the Netherlands and is as old as metal FIAT itself. Even parties such as the National Lottery, Political Parties, Environmental Interest Groups and the National Postal Service have made use of this type of marketing.
The stickers are made from paper and do not cause any permanent changes to the coins, over time they will disintegrate. If someone really wants they get take off the sticker with only a little bit of effort. 
For those people worried about compatibilty with vending machines:

How much money have the Winklevii already lost in Bitcoin?

thanks for your feedback.

Thanks for this feedback. I'm trying to fix it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:33:04
Because the elites can no longer control you and your friends.
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:54:57
I think the design looks nice.

Hey, 
I started a webshop called stickybitcoins selling Bitcoin Stickers the size of common used coins. The thought is to use the ''old system to promote the new'' :). 
You can find my shop via:

Boy what are you saying? -- It is illegal to deface US Currency. Title 18, Section 333 of the United States Code, defacement, mutilating, cutting, disfiguring, perforating, uniting or cementing together any bank bill, draft, note or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, **with intent to render such items unfit to be reissued**, shall be fined and/or imprisoned for up to six months. **putting stickers on coins is NOT illegal**

Dear sir, as I already indicated there are certain fixed costs. I agree that if you want 25 stickers it would be cheaper to go and buy a completely new printer for yourself, put time and effort into designing your own sticker and start printing them yourself on sheets you bought on Amazon. All I can advise is that you buy more to benefit from the advantages of scale... 
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:45:06
Another dump incoming. Great!
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:20:58
The thing with bitcoin is that none knows who started it. Any successor lacks this advantage.

Infographics are always useful! Hope speakers will use it in their presentations.

Some people might say there are too many exchanges. But every exchange puts effort in convincing and informing new potential customers. There can thus never be enough exchanges! I'm sure that with a good team behind it, this one is going to be a winner.
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:52:56
I agree
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:16:52
I'm sorry, i was guided emotion. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:18:54
I am sorry to hear that but, Unfortunately, we have to deal with some fixed costs, which make up for a significant share of the price at lower quanitities. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:09:40
Our Sales enabled us to more than half our prices. Thanks everyone.

It would not be a ''big'' thing if they would ban Bitcoin right?... right?!
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:34:47
I see Bitcoin as a Company that owns the Technology behind it. The actual coins represent shares in the company. The world has to decide what the value of the Technology. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:56:22
wow. Europe is outperforming North America.
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:11:15
Well done!
