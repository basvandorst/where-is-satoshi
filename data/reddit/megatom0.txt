I dunno man I made a great trade once when I was tripping. I sold a bunch of ETH for BTC right around the end of June when ETH was slowly bleeding out and BTC had been chugging along around 2000. A few weeks later it blasted off. And I've never looked back!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:28:44
Serious FUCK r/btc those pieces of shit of there deserve the worst spot in hell. This story is so many people. Maybe not on this same level but on some level. Those bastards are just conning people. You know that whiny little ******* Roger Ver made off like a bandit during that pump and dump. You know he was behind it as well. Everyone one of these bcash retards needs to fucking piss off. Everytime I check the full ticker of cryptos I see bcash right there. Piece of shit coin. It should have died a long time ago. Fuck anyone who says having these alt coin bullshit bitcoin ripoffs are good for bitcoin, it isn't it is just people trying to hurt others for their own profit and that includes all the zombies, sockpuppets, and asshats over at r/btc. Burn them all to the ground.

This is awesome. The stock market isn't going to ruin bitcoin. Bitcoin is going to ruin the stock market!

I'm in a position now where I have invested only what I could afford to lose. I literally spent the money I usually spend on hookers and drugs and put half of that towards BTC. But now if BTC tanks I'd lose a lot of money. It isn't fuck-you kind of money but it isn't any think to scoff at. I have faith in BTC and in crypto currency. I can just feel like we might be in for a rough ride here. But as usual with any big gains the FUD is out there and it gets in my head too easily. I hate it when people say shit like "is this money you can afford to lose for 2 years or more". I get that it is fair to warn people of the potential dangers, but the last big crash came from a lot of outside sources. Yet things like Coinbase's rapid user growth that they are obviously having issues with does give legitimate concerns. I don't think it will be a Mt.Gox situation but it does feel like their are some bolts coming lose. Then again BTC is in need of a correction, and that's just the way it works.

I know whenever I trip and think about BTC it just makes me happy. I remember after one night tripping at a Roger Waters show I saw how down BTC was, and ETH was falling at the same time. I had over invested in ETH and BTC was right around 2000 after coming down from 3000 (yeah to think back in July we were complaining about that!) so I remember watching it go below 2000 and I had this sinking feeling, but then I said no I BELIEVE IN BITCOIN, so I sold some of my ETH for BTC and then brought some on top of that, a week later we were blasting off for 3000 and beyond!

If we see 20K by Christmas I'm going to sell off my initial buy in. This will be for two reasons. 1 I literally bought in a year ago to this day. 2 I can sleep really easy knowing I have nothing but profits. Also I'm selling all my alts for BTC in the meantime.

It's hard not to think this way honestly. I remember a guy posting on here that he took out a some kind of loan for 200,000 back when it was 1200. That guy is rolling in it. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:08:47
The thing I'm seeing to do is to play both. I sold off a considerable amount of ETH to buy BCH when it was around the 400 mark. I honestly wish I had gone full tilt with it, but nevertheless. I think BCH is as valid as any other crypto here, plus it has an edge of having the bitcoin name attached. I would think/hope most others here are divested into other things than bitcoin, if not they are losing out, and BCH is no different. Do I think it is the inheritor to BTC? probably not, but it does have a lot of hype around it and that means money in the short term for cryptos.

Any of the other music as good as this song. I actually quite enjoyed it and don't usually go for Bollywood/Indian films. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:16:20
I mean think about it logically here for a second. This might have pushed up speculative sales but this new ATH isn't from actual new buyers. Consider what you have to do to buy BTC you have to go to an exchange put in a bunch of information, get verified, then buy, it is a process that takes a couple of days at least. So if this gets more people into BTC which I think it will, then we haven't even seen that.

This is the thing the market is very different now than 4 years ago. Think about how long 4 years is in the crypto world. All we have seen in just the past few months, and things are only moving faster. Bitcoin since may has gain $40 billion-with-a-B. Think about that. That's a fuck ton of money, can someone really manipulate this on that level, sure I guess so anything can be faked with enough people behind it. But for some reason I don't buy that here. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:15:43
Because more people are investing in it. The price is based on the market cap. It was 20 billion back in the beginning of May and it is 66 billion now.

It doesn't move very much. If you think BTC will crash back down to $3000 then putting it in LTC makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:21:51
Any one who saw this and didn't own BTC before likely hasn't bought yet because of this, simply because of the steps required to buy BTC from fiat. It takes a couple of days to get registered and whatnot. Sure you could buy from something like Liberty X but then you still need to learn the basics of BTC like getting a wallet and all that. I doubt that happened on a massive scale in just 3hrs (not to mention how difficult it can be to track down a liberty x or btc ATM). So if this does indeed bring in new people we have yet to see it. So buy safe every one.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:11:16
I mean holy fucking shit the market cap has gone up 20 billion with a b dollars since last week. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:10:28
Yeah I'm trying to break out of that ideology. To me it seems like so many of the alt coins have fizzled out, and as fast as things move in the crypto world I don't think there is harm in moving things around to take advantage of an opportunity. IMO BTC and ETH I will keep with the hold, but I know to buy back the BCH I sold off a lot of the other coins that haven't done anything for a long time and had so much hype (looking at you Steem and Golem). At least with buying back BCH I have made the money back I lost on them and then some. I did the same thing with NEO. I get the idea behind holding but I think there should be a set amount you are willing to move around. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:33:46
Why? We've been through $1000 dips just a month ago. It bounced right back to here. A few months before that we had about a $500 dip as well. This is just the cycle of things. Just think about this. *Every* dip Bitcoin has been through it has bounced back to its ATH and past it. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:58:16
The thing is it isn't just stupidity. It is dangerous. we all know FUD can have a real effect on stuff. These little freaks making posts on *every* crypto subreddit with titles like "BTC is in a death spiral and will plummet to zero by next month" is more than just dumb activity it is dangerous and more than anything is is truly an asshole sentiment. This is *actively hoping* people lose a lot of money. Think about that, think about what they want. They want to destroy not create. They want to leave the crypto market in shambles. If BTC falls apart cryptos will be dead to the mainstream for a very long time. so fuck anyone who spreads this shit. It is selfish and irresponsible. I don't mind BCH existing but I do mind shills, bot accounts, and misleading marketing that this toxic community subsists on.

It will need a $1 trillion market cap to be worth ~50,000. I don't know if this is outrageous or going to happen in just a few years. The market cap has gained 40 billion since May. If it follows this rate it will be worth that price in about 6 years. 500,000 will take a lot more.

I own BTC and BCH. But goddamn are BCH supporters fucking awful. all they do is spread FUD. and I honestly can't tell if it is trolling or if they legit believe this. I recall seeing a post on r/bitcoinmarkets titled "with Btc already in its death spiral why isn't the price decreasing". It was someone literally hoping for BTC to go to zero. I'm sorry but fuck whoever posts this fuck whoever supports this sentiment. This isn't just about you being "right" this is about peoples hard earned money spreading FUD to hope people lose money is an outright asshole thing to do. I have plenty of coins but I don't want the ones I don't support to fall to zero. Not to mention it is so fucking selfish and short sighted. If BTC tanks ALL cryptos tank. Period. BTC is the name and face to the general public and without that a lot falls apart. The newbies who just entered the market will pull out and NEVER return. Keep that in mind you r/btc pricks.
I will buy BCH and BTC and profit off of both, but I will NEVER be a part of a community that acts the way r/btc and bch supporters act. I honestly wish them the worst.

The way to look at ATHs is that this is a price that you *will* see again. I think we'll see it come back down eventually like later this week. But the way I look at it is eventually this will be worth the 3400 price again. This has happened *everytime* for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:28:32
I'm really glad it didn't especially before the fork. I think eventually it might get there. I'm split pretty evenly between BTC and ETH. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:30:16
I don't think they are as worthless as you might expect. My mom bought me one because I got her into BTC back in May and is super excited by it now. I keep it on my desk at work and people ask me about it, I tell them its BTC and to look into it. I don't evangelize or anything just tell them about it. I've had 4 people come back and ask me how to get into it. And I give them the basic steps. They've made money on it so far. So that's why I say it isn't worthless, it is something that can easily help to market this stuff on a personal level, which is exactly how Mr. Cena is using it here.
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:29:17


I actually think it was its worst in July honestly. Like right when BTC was dipping back to $2000 there were people here with upvoted comments saying stuff like "congratulations you made a worthless store of wealth" and how BTC was dead. May and June at least had some ATH stuff going on and dumb memes.

Look at the [logarithmic price chart of Bitcoin over the years.](
This increase has been very steady over the course of 8 months. The other would have 30x-5x increases in a matter of 3 months. I also fall into the camp of "this time *is* different". Before there were so few exchanges and MtGox was what added to the depth of the crash back in 2013 that BTC is only *now* recovering from. The market isn't as easy to manipulate as it was before. Don't get me wrong there will be some correction soon, but a full on crash I'm not certain of. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:56:33
I mean 12-20% (which is the range of numbers I have heard that China makes up in all the cryptospace) *is* significant, but it isn't the end of the world. BTC has existed without it before, additionally the number of new users coming in to western exchanges shows that BTC is growing overall beyond just being localized to one economy. I won't spin this as "BTC is fine without China", it would be better with China but it still has a lot of room to grow even without them. This will take some time to recover from though a few months in the least. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:14:55
I don't think there will be much panic about the fork. There should have been more of a panic before in August but it did fine. Additionally if you have used a segwit wallet then you realize that BTC utility is only doing better. Also BTC is typically good about factoring the news into its price long before an event hits. The crash in June and July was from all the bullshit over the fork in August, and it bounced right back from all of that. I don't think all the stuff with this China ban is *done*. I think most people who will be selling their bit coin will have done it before the end of next week. And honestly rigth now they have a decent price to sell at if they were going to. I think we already saw the panic in a lot of ways not just yesterday but all of the slippage since last thursday.

Napster was an illegal file sharing program. It was never really much of a company, and the service it provided was always going to get shut down. I would actually compare BTC more to iTunes. iTunes was one of the early markets to really allow for legal sale of MP3s, and it is a staple of people's lives to this day. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:27:52
I'm in the same boat. Honestly this is how I'm looking at it. I've earned a lot from this. Am I now willing to bet that to have financial stability for the rest of my life? The answer for me is yes. What I have put in, I can afford to lose at this point, I wouldn't be happy, but I wouldn't be on my ass either. The money I've made from it already is good, but having the realization that it could be a life altering thing and not just enough for a new car, makes me look at it different. I think it is worth the bet, and I think things are in our favor.

Ah man I can't say that is a good idea. Don't put money in that you can't afford to lose. College loans should be used for college, and buying into the FOMO (fear of missing out) is usually a bad call. I would say the responsible thing to do at this point is sell what you have now, you will have made a small profit and then buy back in after a correct and only do so with money that you have saved up and can afford to lose. 
However I will also say that there have been a few people on here who back in like May and June took out morgages on their house to buy into it. This one fellow put $250,000 into it when it was around 1800. It looked like it was topping then, but I'm sure he is sitting pretty right now. But I can say that this is the rarity and not the example you should follow. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:32:06
See I'm in the same boat. At this point I've made enough to buy something nice, but if I keep it in, and if it actually hit a *real* bubble like 2013 and we saw a 5x rise from this point, I would have a full on retirement fund. That is was something that put things into perspective. I could sell and hedge my losses, or I could bet on it coming out on top and honestly giving me something life changing. I'm willing to bet on that. It could crash out, but from what I've invested I'd be okay, I wouldn't be happy, but I'd still have a roof over my head and a steady paycheck. To me it is worth the risk.

Sure it definitely could have helped us get to moon numbers much faster. This will slow its growth but it won't end it. If anything it definitely feels like China's influence in price has made for more wild swings and shifts in the markets in general.

I'm with you but I'm also buying into the hype right now. Honestly a full on bubble like 2013 would be insane right now. This price moving to 5x its value. I would be able to retire. I'd sell the fuck out of a $25,000 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:13:48
Honestly, I don't think quite 1 mill but 21 btc = 500,000 might be possible if we have a true crazy bubble like they had in 2011 and 2013. A lot of those showed ramp ups of 5x in like a month. If we had that now, good lord we'd be there. I'd retire at 31.

This is something I honestly don't get. I get having to get your coins off of the exchanges, but if the point of all the Chinese bitcoin buying is because of issues with their currency then wouldn't it make sense to still keep it in BTC? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:55:14
Very good question. I guess I am also coming at this from the perspective of a single man with no wife or kids. So my threshhold for retirement is probably lower. But $100,000 BTC isn't impossible. Hold on to that dream!

Do you mean % or just the sheet number? I understand this is also the biggest change in a day by the sheer dollar value but I think that is unfair given how high the price it now, it just makes it seem worse than it might actually be.

FUD is stronger than numbers. It is also a matter of this story just slowly leaking out as opposed to just hitting us all at once. Throw on top of this mess that a real correction was due as well, then you have enough stuff to really make this all shake out in a bad way. Each bit of FUD knocked it down about $200 this was prolonged over the weekend, then throw on the actual real news landing today and then the correct dip happened (about 12% happened just today) and it makes a bit more sense. Having said that I feel like the natural correction would have taken us to around 4K. So in some ways the price we have now *makes sense* to me. However we haven't truly seen the reaction the chinese and Asian markets will have. not to mention I expect the other exchanges announcing their closings in the next couple of days will have a similar effects. I think it is possible we will see sub 3K prices from this. But I do think by early next year we will be back to 4K, which will reflect its more true value with the chinese market subtracted.

Eh see I have my stack I hodl and keep in cold storage, and then I have around 15% that I play with a little bit. Most of the time it just sits there, but with some of the big swings recently I've done more buying and selling with it just to have some fun with it. I've made a few extra fractions of a BTC from it so far.  And actually from that right now I have about half in BTC and half back in fiat. I had sold all of that 15% when things fell around 3,750. Then I had half of it buy back at 3000 and the other half buy back around 2700. The 2700 didn't hit. So that is why I was asking this question. 
I completely believe in BTC and holding. But having a little bit to play around with during swings like this makes you feel a little better during them, as you can make something with it. And it doesn't feel like a completely wasted opportunity. I'm also at the point where I have already made the big buy ins to BTC that I am willing to put in, and even during big dips like this I can only buy maybe $200 max based on the "don't put in what you can't afford to lose" idea.

I mean I've been *okay* with what BTC has been doing over the past month. There have been some big moves sure but there was a certain feeling of consistency to it. It is this $800 change in one day that just feels so weird. I guess we have had swings this big before in a single day, but I legitimately don't know.

Oh I love my job. So it wouldn't be a matter of quitting or anything, but just having that knowledge that if things ever go south I have a big safety net. I am blessed enough not to sweat over day to day finances but retirement for me is something that has become difficult to save for. Having it solidly in place like that would let me spend more money on things like trips and stuff.

Anyone know if it is possible to sell coins in one place specifically? I'd sell 1btc for $6000 right now.

I mean 12-20% (which is the range of numbers I have heard that China makes up in all the cryptospace) *is* significant, but it isn't the end of the world. BTC has existed without it before, additionally the number of new users coming in to western exchanges shows that BTC is growing overall beyond just being localized to one economy. I won't spin this as "BTC is fine without China", it would be better with China but it still has a lot of room to grow even without them. This will take some time to recover from though a few months in the least.

Napster was an illegal file sharing program. It was never really much of a company, and the service it provided was always going to get shut down. I would actually compare BTC more to iTunes. iTunes was one of the early markets to really allow for legal sale of MP3s, and it is a staple of people's lives to this day. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:36:40
Am I the only one who would be happy coasting around 4K for a couple of months and just prove that BTC can be stable without China's influence, then see steady real growth over the next year ending 2018 around $10,000.

Oh I'm sticking around. I had a verbal argument with myself this morning when I plugged my Trezor in planning to shift some funds to an exchange. I had bought a trezor specifically to set aside a certain amount *never* to sell. I ended up not transfering anything. But I did have 10% of my stack on the exchange I sold some of  that on Wednesday. I was going to wait a few days before buying back in though, even though if I bought back right now I'd be even. I just feel like things are still a bit too shakey. I'm glad I have some to play with because it makes times like these feel fun than just depressing, but I am very glad I have most of it set away.

A $15,000 coin is retirement money for me. I would sell at least 75% of my stake if that happened. And the thing is you're right. A run like 2013 at this point would mean just that. It's crazy to me that I could have financial security for a long time with just that.

Sure it definitely could have helped us get to moon numbers much faster. This will slow its growth but it won't end it. If anything it definitely feels like China's influence in price has made for more wild swings and shifts in the markets in general. I'm okay with them not having 40-50% control down the line as that kind of thing might actually prevent people in western countries from getting in on it. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:55:49
This didn't happen through the various 4300-3600 swings we saw.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:59:30


Would they? Does SWATting happen in other countries with less militarized police forces? Plus what are they hoping to accomplish just by intruding into someone's house unannounced like this with guns drawn? It is my understanding they are responding to a call that there is someone armed in the house threatening to hurt others. If they were threatening to hurt others wouldn't this make them more likely just to start doing so? To me the whole thing doesn't make much sense as an attempt to prevent violence when it is being threatened. I get a raid like this if it is a bust or something as they don't want people escaping, but if they have hostages wouldn't it be better to assess that there is an actual hostage situation first.

Only if you want to play the game of trading around. I wish I had not jumped on so many band wagons like I did. I know if I had just stuck with BTC investing I would be better off today. With the Alt coins it was more exciting I guess, I'd make money then lose money. I would never say trade BTC for alts though. Buy alts with extra money IMO.

I mean if that guy really did that and bought when he said he did, sold now, he'd have made around $100,000. If it does top out at 10,000 he'll be a millionaire.

Jesus what a rollercoaster day. I saw it diving like that and I was *REALLY* temped to dump it, but WTF 7 hours later its back at 1620. This shit is really going to happen isn't it? We'll be well over 2000 by the end of the year won't we.

I agree. I've followed this advice and done pretty well. Sure this sub is full of shitposts but there is wisdom in some of the comments.

Is 20K by 2020 really possible? Jesus. can someone who knows better than I put what this article says in simpler terms and legitimacy. Because all I'm hearing is hype and buy $10,000 worth right now.

I gotcha. Yeah I don't have kids or a morgage so I could probably invest some significant amount.

It went up way too fast it is healthy to have this kind of correction.

Is it though? I wouldn't even be buying BTC if it weren't for listening to others. I just put this question out there because there *are* people on here with a better grasp of economics and whatnot than I do. I was more or less directing this question in that regard. If someone who knew better would tell me if this idea is completely bunk or not. Knowing your limitations or understanding of a subject isn't a bad thing, and asking others more knowledgeable their opinion on a certain thing is always a good idea. Also with so much of this stuff it is easy to misdirect yourself with self determined research. It's like if you have a bad cough and you look up shit on WebMD you end up thinking you've got cancer because you directed yourself that way, where it is a better idea to ask an actual medical professional. Sadly there is no real professional to go to for advice on bitcoin, so this is the best we got. 
Also I was being hyperbolic about investing 10,000 right now.

I mean sudden growth took us past $1000 back in December; 6 months later its double that. Yes it will probably come back down at some point. But I think these highs just show that this will be the new norm for it.

I think if you bought now you'd still be happy with that in a month. Follow the advice that people put out. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Space out your buying a bit as well. I feel like we are seeing so much panic here because you had people buy in when it was 2400 and then were still hoping for huge gains after it has doubled in two months. I hope it cools off for a little bit here. I would rather have it maintain a 2300-2500 price range for a couple of weeks. The spike to 2800 was nuts, and was obviously needing a correction. I don't expect the bottom to drop out here but a cooling off period would be healthy. Come the ramp up to august I would expect some more gains with the changes happening then.

Sorry but if you are using coinbase to get funds for illegal stuff you are an idiot. In spite of being thought of as anonymous a lot of this stuff can be easy to track if you are careless about it all. The fact is you should never transfer directly from coinbase if you are buying on the darknet and any idiot will tell you that.
