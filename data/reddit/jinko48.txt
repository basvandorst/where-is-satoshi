What is it that makes deflationary assets a destructive economic force?

Is it really that buggy? I haven't heard of any serious malfunctions, but I haven't really been paying attention recently.

Been thinking this for a while as well

What is FUD?

Everything is good for Bitcoin.

For sake of ease, using Coinbase to buy some BTC will probably be your best bet. You definitely don't need to hire someone to make a purchase from the exchange. I think it's not as complicated as you might think to get started. You are correct about hardware wallets being more secure, I use one myself, but that doesn't mean there aren't uses for software wallets. For example having a wallet on your phone could be very convenient for making transactions but not a very good idea for long term storage.

if you care about using other exchanges with different advantages check [this link]( out with a few choices.

This isn't only related to bitcoin, but how would atomic swaps work, and how far along is its development? Are there any good links to read up on it?
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:39:53
Yeah that's pretty much as far as I was able to find out about it as well. The reason I wonder about this is because there are so many over the counter exchanges on discord communities that rely on escrows. Atomic swaps or some kind of similar solution would have a huge impact imo.
Thanks for the help!

Are there any popular applications of it currently? Like let's say I want to do an atomic swap of ETH and BTC, where would I go to get a tool/app like that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:22:38
It is probably policy on their site that you need to be 18 to have an account, I don't think they are going to stop you though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:15:55
Go to coinbase.com or download their app, its really easy from there to buy some.

This is why decentralized exchanges like bisq are useful!

Thanks m8. So this is just the Core Client correct? Anything significant worth mentioning you think? I saw that segwit support and some simple UI changes were added.

Haven't been up to date on this. What is 0.16.0?

Real Bitcoin™

Nope. It's like freedom of speech. If you don't let everyone have it no matter how terrible the use is, then you jeopardize everyone's right to freedom of speech.
Like you said slippery slope.

It's completely disconnected from their system. They can't touch it. If people were to start using bitcoin as a store of value or unit of exchange that would be direct competition that they literally cannot compete with due to decentralization.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:30:15
 
I guess they didn't want my bitcoin.
