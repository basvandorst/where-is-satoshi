I actually did the same thing last week, same slushpool.  I saw that I had .026 Bitcoin, but in my haste and excitement read it as .26.  after calling and texting everyone I excitingly went back to set up the reward payout and then got sad.  But hey, was at least over $500 on bit I did not have before!

I swear, the coin said she wanted it.

if it holds around here we will have a reverse head and shoulder on both daily and weekly charts, but it need to hold in this range.  A lot of manipulation seems to be occurring more and more as seasoned traders seems to have taken an interest and have the money to influence this more than the rest of us.

i got 3 orders in during the drop, only missed the 8870 one.

that was the lowest i saw, only on coinbase, even lower than the bitfinex chart showed which was around 9k.

yea can sell when sitting there but on any extremes good luck, and that is exactly the time you want to buy or sell!

I believe this is the case.  Gemini, on the other hand, does not seem to be since there is no spread.

The Bitcoin was not shiny enough so I need to return.

This is coinbase making even more money.  You will note the price they publish is different than the buy or sell price.  Gemini and most other exchanges only charge a fee, but coinbase rips you off with both a high fee and a high spread.  Best to get out of them if you can.  There is always some spread but this is NOT the buy sell spread as mentioned in another comment, it is just profit taking by coinbase.  In the backend they just pocket the difference between the published rate and the buy sell rate.

Yes. I never said it was bad, others here did :) I was moving my bit out of coinbase until they announced this.

sounds like a stop market order vs stop limit order.  always do limit to avoid this.  of course the risk is you can not get filled but if you put the limit below the stop you normally would have been ok, but in this case it would have filled going back up anyway.

Coinbase has already said they will split and you will get both coins automatically.  Was posted a few days back.
