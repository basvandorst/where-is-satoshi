"Upwards of" means "a number greater than". 
"Up to" means "a number lower than or equal to".

So you're saying I can defer gratification now in order to gain later, like some kind of...capitalist? Kidding aside, how long should I wait, until I die, until my children die, my grandchildren? Eventually I'll want to buy something. Eventually everyone needs and wants to buy things and equilibrium is achieved. Market forces incentivize people over the long term to hoard the same amount regardless of the money used, it's just the purchases people make are smaller more frequent purchases or larger less frequent purchases depending on the strength of the currency they use, where larger purchases are more economically efficient for a multitude of reasons such as:
Higher per-purchase consideration and comparison
Economies of scale
Discouraged impulsiveness/emotionality
It's great that you believe in animal spirits though. Let me know how that goes. It's still hard to believe educated people, even economists could think in confused 19th century terms.

What is the proportion of non-bitcoin orders where people do not end up finishing, to the bitcoin orders where people do not end up finishing?
90% of bitcoin transactions with a small sample size, perhaps people are curious about what that payment option is. Are you sure 50-90% of non-bitcoin orders are not also going uncompleted?
Sometimes I 'shop ahead' to check fees, shipping types, agreements, information required to purchase (I pay a premium for giving out as little information as possible) and whatnot, only to not end up checking out the first time, but only in entirely automated systems as I don't want to waste people's time.

I don't think you know what "force" is.
