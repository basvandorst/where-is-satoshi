Yeah, opposite of what this guy's saying.

Jesus this woman needs to calm down. I was a software engineer in the industry up until recently and I have contacts in all sides of the industry including hosting that is willing to work with adult and multiple payment processors for adult.
With that said the level of unprofessionalism she's showing I doubt anyone would be interested in working with her on this.

I think you're jumping the gun here and as a result missing out on the actual meaning.
The app could very well have been talking to his own backend, a backend which could be using the exchange APIs, but since he's directly using the API of the exchanges as opposed to centralizing it in his own backend that's one less thing for him to worry about.
Edit: and when I say one less thing to worry about I mean it's one less thing for him to make sure is up and running as the site could now go down without affecting the app.

Theme? If you're using WordPress then that explains why it'd be slow.
Using the market exchange apis are good though, less for you to worry about.

It's highly possible that it isn't a architectural issue but a software issue. Unless the machine this is hosted on is grossly underpowered I'd put my money on it being inefficient code.
It's much easier to make slow code than to outgrow your server hardware.
Edit: when I say the machine this is hosted on I obviously mean the backend and not the actual app itself.

What have they done?

You kinda answered your own question. 
Unfortunately I'm not entirely familiar with what kind of additional data you could provide but say he decided to make a mobile app, he could strip useless information to reduce data usage. I'm sure there are other things as well.

Welp. Can't argue with that logic. Guess I'll sell.
