This is why I bought some eth. A friend of mine wanted some, I had a coinbase acct, bought some for him, transferred it over, and was amazed at how fast it went, confirmations and everything. Btc always feels like a slog to send money anywhere when they require multiple confirmations before accepting the tx.
Bring on lightning networks and side chains and make it a hell of a lot faster, and btc may be acceptable for mass use. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:15
yeah, the 2nd L would have increased it pretty bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:31
just like Tulips!
yeah I was running it on my $400 school laptop in 2014, so I gave it a lot of leeway (1 for i, only doing 1 "l", etc) because I knew it would take forever. I should try again with something newer.

i left my computer running a vanity program for an entire week while i was away for xmas vacation. Came back and still had to wait another day before I got 1**vaN1La**Hq7oMYZcCVZqDKa3wSYRMT9SVX (I was making and selling vanilla at the time)

Hopefully she's just forgotten about it. Look her up. Have her take your whole crew to dinner
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:52:41
Not only that, but if you're a buyer, you don't want to buy if next week that thing you bought essentially could cost 20% less.
But I think everyone is betting on btc becoming relatively stable at some point. It was mostly stable (between 350-450) for 6-7 months in late 2015-early 2016. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:51:49
The first time I tried to buy bitcoin I got scammed out of $185. I never wanted to scam anyone else. I did want to use awesome CSI, computer phorensics skills to find out who this guy was and get him arrested after beating the shit out of him. But alas, google voice numbers are hard to trace. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:01:02
Thankfully just lots and lots of time. 
How much money have you lost from bitcoin?

Thanks for the reply. You make some very valid points. But I think with the right approach, single payer (NOT "socialized medicine") could work fairly well. We just need to have a very frank and honest discussion on things like reimbursement, cost of education, standard of living, scholarship, etc.
The problem is that, as you said, too many big players have fingers in the pot trying to keep the status quo. It would take a round of saintly, untouchable type politicians, who would be smart enough to ask and address the right questions without cowtowing to the companies who will pay the highest prices.
Which of course will never happen in this country until we get big money out of politics and end our growing history of providing crony-capitalism's wet dream. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:37:20
and docs aren't getting burnt out here? holy shit. I'm a medical professional (pharmacist) that used to work full time in a primary care clinic. Physicians are busting their asses to see 30 pts a day so they can pay the rent on their building because reimbursement is so low. And new docs are graduating with $500,000 in medical school debt, so they feel it even worse, because if they don't see 30 pts a day, they're not gonna make their student loan payment, let alone their rent. 
I think many newly graduated doctors would gladly accept lower payment for their services, or even higher taxes, if it guaranteed better tuition rates, lower-interest student loans, etc. 
The "system" doesn't work. or it barely works. It works so that whether you went to school for 20 years to become a dr or dropped out of high school and got a trade job, you make about the same amount of money while the doctor gets his pockets rifled through every month for student loans and taxes. FUCK our nation is so screwed.

My mom would frequently take us out of school to go on trips. We did Thailand, Korea, Singapore, Australia, Japan... She'd say "Don't let school get in the way of your education."

i need it to be at 100k. then I can pay off my student loans. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:16:47
A couple problems:
Many conditions require a physical examination for proper medical evaluation, so an online forum would be limited in the conditions that could be properly discussed. 
Next, lab work, blood pressure, etc are also frequently required by an examining physician. These are easily transmitted online, but can be expensive or impossible to get without a Dr's order. 
That being said, I'd be interested in providing medical advice to the extent of my knowledge (starting a clinical pharmacy residency in June). A lot of what I do is medication reconciliation--identifying polypharmacy and gaps in medication therapy. So if you or anyone you know has medication questions, send them my way! 
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:45:42
You explained it perfectly 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:17:45
Use key generator (some recommend doing it on a computer not connected to the Internet), write down private key on paper. Send bitcoin to public address associated with private key. 100 years from now, put private key into wallet. Wallet finds public addresses associated with private key. Profit

It's been touchy for me in many instances. I just consider myself lucky if it happens to work that day.

Paper also won't fail after 10 or 100 years if it stays dry. Hardware can easily fail

@_date: 2013-11-12 22:34:42
any idea if this is a common occurrance? I put an order in 2 days ago.. first time order.. bank and phone are verified.. I hope mine goes through! i've had some bumps getting into BTC (fell for a scam a couple weeks ago), so I'm hoping I can finally catch a break!
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:46:03
if you had invested $100 in Amazon's IPO, that investment would have been worth $63,990 by close May 12, 2017.
If you had invested $100 in Bitcoin in 2010, according to the price above, you'd have $12.2 Million today. 
I don't disagree with you, but the scale on bitcoin has been enormous. I bought 10 shares of TSLA at $50. While the $3000 in profit looks nice, it's not life-changing.
Lots of us want dat life-changing money.

Full of shit or not, I've been [correctly predicting]( that ~$700 is where BTC would go for about a week now. And it's been sitting at ~$700 for the last 48 hours. Realizing that time will only tell where it goes from here, maybe I'm seeing something that you're not. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:25:33
My sentiment/opinion was based on the charts I had been looking at from between November 17-26 where despite a sell-off, there was still some *support* at the $700 level. 
My small business accepts bitcoin, so I know how you feel about "stability." Too bad most of my orders last month came during Black Friday where BTC was at its height. It's all good. Buy and hold.

We source vanilla from 5 different countries including:
Papua New Guinea
And we're working on Mexican and Tongan as well. 
We buy the beans in bulk from sources in those countries, extract them using the finest American-made vodka (distilled in our hometown of Las Vegas, NV), and sell them in 4oz bottles.
We're backordered right now, but you can check us out on [facebook]( We should have some available for sale in 1 month. We're hoping to ramp up production so we'll have a constant supply available through the summer and into fall. 
/shameless plug. :-)
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:11:11
We don't have a website really set up (we sell mostly locally and recently through a kickstarter project), so it'd be more convenient to list elsewhere. 
We sell a variety of vanilla extracts. Who knows what the market for that is in bitcoin-world, but we thought we'd give it a try. :-)
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:32:35
I totally agree. I've been looking at the btc charts, and I do a ton of stock trading as well. I definitely see some good support in the $700 range. I think that will be "normal," for a while as it slowly creeps up to $800. Then we'll get another surge and who knows where it will go. 
Get while the gettin's good, comrades.

From my understanding, Joseph was the least racist of the early leaders of Mormonism. He ordained black men to the priesthood and treated them pretty fairly. If you want to talk about racism you should have picked one of Joseph's successors over the 130+ years after his death. Those guys were definitely racist.

I own a small business that sold a few hundred dollars' worth of product on Bitcoin Black Friday. I actually didn't convert any of my earnings out of BTC. The amount I sold wasn't a significant portion of my income, and I think BTC is going to go much higher. 
If BTC continues to go down, I think there's still significant support at the $700-800 range. It may settle down there (but likely much higher) and then I fully expect another surge within the next 6 months. 
So for me, selling product for BTC was more of an opportunity to "collect" bitcoins rather than to earn money. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:24:57
I hear you. Black Friday was kind of a perfect storm with the prices up so high. I sold several hundred dollars worth of product from another company of mine. 
However, I feel like BTC is gonna level off for a little while, and the investors are gonna get bored. And they'll either sell outright or (if we can convince them) they'll buy some stuff on their way out. I'm hoping for the latter. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 21:28:29
depending on the substance, the dosage, the duration of "therapy", etc you may be right, but you might be wrong. 
Psilocybin (the hallucinogen in mushrooms) was used recently in a [study by Johns Hopkins]( to treat long term depression. After a regimen of treatment, nearly 20% of the patients were able to cease antidepressant therapy all together. 
My broader point is that I think all these substances should be studied and openly discussed, not hidden away by the authority of our government.

Joseph Smith (the founder of Mormonism) proposed this same method to ending slavery, and I believe it was one of the points in his campaign when he made a bid for the presidency in March of 1844. He was shot to death 2 months later, so obviously nothing quite came of that
