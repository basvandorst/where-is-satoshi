I've only had rando Bitcoin things pushed to me. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:00:46
I think some have an idea that when they are ready to sell, they won't be. They'll be using it instead as a default.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:21:11
Exactly. I don't know when it'll happen, but probably while I'm around. Might as well grab some and hodl it now.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:08:22
I just go oh, -32% ��‍♂️ back to work
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:06

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:12:42
Well, Thanks for holding it hostage for months coinbase, sold all my free cash from hodling Bitcoin now for three years. Thanks for the 700 dollar Christmas tip, and fuck you bitcoincash
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:14
Omg let me sell this crap please.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:55:16
I bought at 288 ����
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:11:46
I only came here for the memes
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:59:16
If we start falling below 10k I'm selling and I'll rebuy
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:50:08
Bought years ago, calm down everybody
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:21:38
I'll take my 700$, I don't want to support it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:33:17
I sent my buddy free fallin by Tom Petty and didn't say anything untill after he checked his accounts ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:26:40
Thanks. It's not much but, I'm pro Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:16:45
What the fuck am I supposed to do if I only have a phone and no computer
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:42

@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:06
Explain please. For the record. I am an advocate for hodl
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:15:19
I read somewhere somewhere close to a third of the total bitcoins will be lost. Which is hilarious
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:58:24

LPT- your sister is a cunt. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 00:19:07
But some bitcoiners also forget that it could all turn off some day
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:42
To that guy yesterday chewing me out for selling my bcash for a 700$ free profit (and making me whole plus on my inital Bitcoin investment).  Lololololol
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:10:52
Thanks, yeah that is true. I suppose a 1000$ would be a big deal to some and would cash out immediately, my wife and I make good money, and I threw the 75$ in for fun, wish I did more I wouldn't dare try daily trading Bitcoin, it was more of a take some cash out and hold it till a drop and buy back in. I don't want to sell all of it, but reinvesting more personal cash at this price now seems slightly not worth it (fifty dollars at a time)
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:55:14
Right, I get that which is why I don't really want to sell (cuz really, I put 75 dollars in. This is all gravy to me ten years from now.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:26:23
God i would love to see that spreadsheet. I do think it has a future which is why I haven't sold any to date. I just am not a investor person (blue collar, I buy houses not stocks) so I didn't know if there was merit to selling half of my position to reinvest at a later date, say the price comes back down to 2500$ 
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:19:40
a. own Bitcoin
b. you'll take my cash out of my dead hands
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:18:23
I'm pissed I was asleep and missed buying at 5500 at 2 am
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:24:40
Still pissed I didn't get a coinbase bonus. I joined like a week before they did that
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:08:22
I'm still a few points away from .25 ☹️☹️☹️
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:08:26
Yes and bch won't be released till Jan 1
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:41
Can someone please tell me what this is from I want to watch the movie just for this scene
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:17:23
But that gif of the guy dancing through the hall is amazing
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:20:31
I cashed that crap out day I could and y'all thought I was nuts. Take that money and ran. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:04:12
No, it really doesn't. I'm just looking at what I have going to 4500$ to 35, 3, 2700$ currently. But as you said, I never invested enough that I'm worried about loosing it all. Selling my Bitcoincash(trash) already made me profitable in what I've spent on Bitcoin over the years.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:23:22
I will say again, I'm glad I sold my free bcash for 700$ and made myself whole on all my crypto investing. And everyone who gave me shit for selling.....������
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:55:49
I'm really debating selling....I'm up buying around 300... But idk
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:02:16
I, also bought then. I still haven't sold any ��‍♂️
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:30:08
Oh no, I should of dumped ten grand in when price was 244$, missed that boat, house is still being paid off. This is now just a hold and see on the .24345 coin I have
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:40:55
Same situation, spent 75$ when we were at the 200's pricerange with intentions to get a whole coin, didn't but always wanted for the price to drop to buy....now my 75$ is 1200 and I'm kicking myself.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:43:32
I cashed out to get my Bitcoin investment back, I now hold .3 Bitcoin, and it's essentially free for me
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:25:55
Yeah, I'm clear past paying my house off If I did what I wanted to do and didn't get talked out of it by my wife, father,.friends
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:37:51
Wait so....which ones do I keep and which ones do I sell?
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:10:30
This is, hilarious
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:54:13
So fellas, I bought at 220ish to the tune of 75$, that is currently 600ish, should I sell half my btc at this high and reinvest when it dips back below 2k? Or just hold steady my .2354 btc investment for the moon long term.
Thanks
