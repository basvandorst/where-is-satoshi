I think silver has more application than gold. 
The banks in London were rigging the price of gold for the longest time until it came out a year or two ago. 
With new alloys coming out that are far cheaper yet almost as conductive gold scares me. Silver, I'd buy, but not yet. For now I'll stick with ltc and btc

I'm not saying we do it for the good of the world, what I'm saying is we do protect other cointries. 
But we have our own selfish reasons like all the military spending going to boost a large amount of manufacturers in our country. 
I'm just saying while I don't like our world police strategy, we do help some, but yes, yes we do create cliterfucks so we can but in power who we think will benifit is and surprise surprise it usually backfires

Golds worthless when shit hits the fan. You have to lug it around, no one wants it, all people would want are food, guns, bullets, and probably ciggarettes and booze

I disagree that Bitcoin is tied to fiat currencies, hyper inflation is so scary in some parts of the world that they hold the USD. But look at charts and you'll see that when stock markets have a bag day, and the strong fiat currencies dip Bitcoin tends to stay flat or grow. 
Banks are hoping on board ripple because banks so very short term loans with each other, but those fees are extremely high. Chase might loan Wells Fargo $50M for a few days or vice versus or with any banks really. Banks make their money on fees, I don't see them passing on these savings to wire transfers to stock brokers(although I could be wrong). Banks and businesses in general are not in the business to save money for us, rather save money for themselves(again I could be wrong time will tell). 
But would you rather be able to send $10,000 in say 1 hour tops to a broker with Bitcoin you controls that is decentralized for $2? or would you rather go to a bank and try to convince them that's it's worth their time to get $10,000 in ripple for you, and charge no fee(if you're lucky but yeah right)
Banks aren't here to make us money, they're here to cut down on their cexpemses while keeping revenues as high as possible.

They take it and you have to go to court. and usually it costs more in lawyers and court fees to get your money back. Those laws are fucked up

Craigslist....... Or a Bitcoin ATM. But "swim" should know that with the btc-e fiasco everyone is probably going to step up their AML/KYC protocols. Stop doing illegal shit with Bitcoin. You might be some small timer buying for personal use, but I think the recent events that have unfolded over the last month show the governments efforts to make examples out of people. So far examples are big names, but I'm not going to be surprised when they start hitting moderate sized buys. So do yourself a favor and stop doing illegal shit with Bitcoin. It seems like it's more profitable to buy and hold than to buy drugs and sell them over the long term. And one of those can get you multiple felonies.

But see banks take 90% of your deposits and loan them out, then if someone takes that loan and deposits it into a bank another bank can take 90% of that and loan it out. 
Sure banks keep your money safe if you are fully covered by FDIC, but they're building a house of cards that has the potential to come down harder than the 08 crisis. 
Also as I said, send a wire transfer to a stock broker, it takes days and it costs much more than the current absurdly high Bitcoin fee I pay of $2. 
Bitcoin was initially talked about as being the future of micro payments, now it is seeming to be the future of mass payments.
For example. Currently I trade on Etrade and TDameritrade. I use margin so I can borrow shares to short should my broker have those shares to loan. If Etrade doesn't have them to loan but TDA does, it takes me 3-5 days to withdraw to my bank, and another 3-5 plus a few to wire or ACH funds to TDA so I can short. By that time I've more than likely missed my ideal sell point. If they allowed Bitcoin withdraws and deposits it could be done in a hour. 
It costs money to move money, that's why so many banks are willing to get on board with ripple, because it can save them billions in transfer fees because believe it or not big banks loan other big banks money on the daily and it's not free. The banks are just to stupid to see ripple for what it really is.

i completely agree with you up until the Middle East. Since the 80s it's been a shit show of which country can put who in power in which state to benefit the most from their oil reserves. Sadam did some VERY VERY VERY bad things to his people, but(not justifying what he did by any means) he kept radicalism in check. Once we took him out and others in the region it's been chaos. Every decade or two the us and Russia and whoever else go in and back rebels they think will help them and what happens 10-20 years later? The mess we are watching now happens. Did you know when Egypt overthrew their government in 2013 which was essentially a military dictarorship(please correct me if I'm wrong) the Egypt that was oppressing their people and we(US) were selling weapons to left and right, well once that shit regime was overthrown by the people because they wanted liberation the US stopped selling the new government weapons because well, the previous shit regime was in our best interest, fuck the people who actually live their right? 
All that said, yes, we've saved the day a lot but for a few decades now it's been Russia VS USA in the Middle East trying to put in power leaders that benefit them the most, and it's making the entire region more and more unstable for people who live there, and even people across the globe. 
I love my country, but some of the things I see unfolding make me extremely sad. Not to mention that a large part of the US economy is military research and spending. While I agree we saved the day in ww1 and ww2, we saved our economy even more by getting involved. Again, I love America, and if you read my other replies above we do play an important role, but some things are better left alone... Cough cough Middle East cough

We protect ports and trade routes across the oceans to help facilitate free trade. 
We also have large trade deficits with other countries, so you can hardly say we borrow things from them.

Bitcoin will be nothing in the end. Bullets and canned goods will be all that matter.
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:10:59
You can't say that without backing it up, let's hear what you got
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:46:15
I'll give you that, but we do help protect and facilitate trade all across the globe courtesy of the US tax payer. But yes, generally when it also benefits us, but it does benifit those other countries as well. 
Again I'm not saying I like spending my tax dollars to fund the military industrial complex our country relies on, but to say other countries don't rely on us is just asinine. 
Again I'm not for it because if we stopped patrolling the worlds oceans and just posted our ships up around the US coast, it would mean the US could use some of those tax savings for kids to go to school and health care. But in turn it would result in countries that rely on us that give those social benefits to their citizens doing one of two things. Raising taxes to further protect their ports, or cutting social programs.
I'm not saying the US does have an agenda here, because it's obvious they do, but everyone we help also has an agenda.

There price was much lower because to deposits hard cash into their exchange the fees are anywhere from 6-10% where as other exchanges don't charge that fee and you just pay the ACH fee that you have to pay before btc-E takes 6-10% depending on your deposit method. They'll be back, I'd bet on it
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:52:32
Look I'm no lover of my tax dollars(as an American) going to foreign military bases that influence the world. But I will say, the massive amount of out budget we spend on military protects free trade all across the globe and other country should damn well be great full for that because they don't have to spend hardly anything to protect themselves or their ports because US taxpayers like me pay for your protection. Now all that being said, the US has no right to take down a foreign exchange for not following US AML/KYC laws because well, it's not an American exchange. If they want to fuck us Americans for using that exchange because Americans knew they were skirting the law then it sucks to be American. But if you're not an American the US has no right to fuck you out of your money/coins. I don't agree with our police the world policy, but think long and hard about how much we(US taxpayers) spend to protect our free trade and other countries free trade by patrolling the high seas and whatever the fuck else we do. It's half the reason or more That countries besides us can have similar tax rates but give greater social benefits to their citizens. Again, I don't agree with the US policing the world, and what they have potentially done to BTC-E, but sit back and think who's tax dollars protect who so your tax dollars can give you what everyone in America wants. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:13:36
Go read above, our bases and my tax dollars protect your free trade. I'm against it, but if we cut our budget and stopped being to world police we could give free college and free healthcare. Instead we foot the bill and for protection. Don't forget Pearl Harbor and the Zimmerman letter, as well as Japan not giving up after the first nuke. 
Just stating facts here, read my other replies as I won't restore them again, but I do somewhat agree.
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:22:47
I'm aware most the world has a different view, and as I've said multiple other times I'm not for our foreign policy. All I'm saying it in some cases we do benifit other nations with our protection, but yes, yes we do manipulate other nations by setting up governments when we aren't a fan of the current government. 
Trust me I agree with most of the criticism that people are posting to my comments. I'd much rather is have a military policy of protecting the US and no other nations with no bases anywhere besides on our states and territories. 
The only thing I'm disagreeing with you guys is the fact that some nations do want our protection, and those nations that due generally have a similar agenda of fucking up governments that don't have that agenda.

As a currency I don't think Bitcoin will be mainstream. As a store of value aka a bank account that I can load a debit card in minutes with or send funds to my broker for $5 in minutes instead of $20 and 0.5% in 3-5 days, I say it has value.
