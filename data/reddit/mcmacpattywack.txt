Weird. I’m nervous I’m not going to receive my purchase now. My bank statement shows a refund of the money.. buy Coinbase is still showing that I’ll get my BTC tomorrow.

Do you really think a 350k house is feasible on your current incomes, living paycheck to paycheck? Sell some to live a bit more comfortably but then hold the rest. Think hard on your relationship and how her knowing this might change things. Maybe you just say you have some side income through investments but don’t let it all out of the bag. Build a stronger budget and stick to it and slowly crawl out of your paycheck to paycheck lifestyle

did they give you a date as to when you would see the funds in your wallet? I just purchased some and it says they should be in there by tomorrow.

So it’s common for my cards to get declined? I tried a few times to purchase then received an email saying the transaction was canceled. Then tried again and it shows on my CB account that the BTC will be in there tomorrow, but then my bank statement shows that I got back my money I spent. I’m worried it will fall through. I guess waiting until tomorrow and possibly calling my bank would be the best bet?

It made me smile as well. Unrestricted climb and blue skies ahead!
