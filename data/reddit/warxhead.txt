But how can you rightfully say it's an upgrade when there's an outspoken part of the community that rejects it? Surely in your mind that can't be consensus if there's enough rally to stop the fork. We would not see such aggression if tensions weren't high and it wasn't an attack.

The market is very volatile right now and you bought as other orders did. Others filled first and there were none left at that price. It actually ended up jumping to 7050.

Correct, if you open GDAX then manage your account balances it has a very easy UI to transfer money back and forth. Coinbase/GDAX are run by the same company so it is safe/secure. Then you want to withdraw your BTC from the GDAX interface into your wallet(if you don't want to keep it on the exchange).

The reason you're getting so much hate is because you're trying to tell a part of the community(and you're talking to this part) that their ideas/work shouldn't even be considered. That current Bitcoin should just be stomped over for the S2X "upgrade." How is this fair in the community at all if there's disagreement?

Are they though? How many people are working on Bitcoin Cash? You can say three developer teams all you want, but go look at the githubs. Look at the commits and pull requests. There isn't the community behind it. That is where it fails. Look at Bitcoin's github. 
This should be eye opening for you. But I guess you just believe that blockstream owns bitcoin, but that simply isn't true. You just won't look deeper into the situation.

And where is your proof that you are not a shill just trying to spew FUD around bitcoin? There is none. 
I suggest you watch: 
If you've already watched this, then you must understand why some major bitcoin supporters have trouble just accepting bigger blocks. Bigger blocks are a band-aid solution that will grow the problem long term anyways. Why not instead fix the issue at hand? We need a way to scale up transaction levels without making nodes too expensive for end users. 
Just because people have different methods of solving problems doesn't make them shills. There are different solutions. Bitcoin is going its way. Bitcoin Cash is going another.

How have they taken control? It seems to me that the majority trust the developers and want bitcoin to keep going as it is. If it were not like that then there would be changes to the code. You know how github works right?

To do bitinstant, you get the two codes, and ask for a moneygram payment slip or find the counter where they are. You just fill out all the information and then the sales associate will punch it into the computer and minutes later you have bitcoins.

I mean I think this can go both ways. I agree that moderation is nice because we get a filtered view of straight shilling or propaganda. However, I think that discussions taking in opinions from both sides(not people just saying THIS IS WHAT IT WILL BE), would be better than no discourse at all. I am NO2X but I like to see the other side's arguments(as long as they are factual and not just well this guy supports it so I do too).

Oh I see. That's something I have glanced over but not taken in consideration that Antpool keeps all the fees. That's the one thing that's bugging me though, currently transaction fees are 10% of their revenue. Let's just say we remain on 1mb blocks and segwit still isn't big in 958 days when the next halving happens. Their the transaction fees suddenly double in value to the miners. 
What I fail to understand is what incentives miners have after this? When their profit will be half? Surely the upkeep for a fair amount will be too much(unless the price SKYROCKETS). 
Do you believe that most of these miners are owned by a business? Or do you believe that these miners are willingly supporting NYA?

Where was he equating his reddit age? He was simply saying noob as in someone inexperienced. says he's been in crypto since the early days yet stores his BTC of IMMENSE value so stupidly. So he has every right to call him a noob.

I would argue that more of the (current) opposition is centered around the fact this change was not consensus but more of force. They had a meeting with the top heads of the bitcoin industry and signed an agreement with which direction bitcoin should go. That is not okay. If they presented it to the whole community this would most likely be a different story(although bigger blocks is quite a hurdle).

The real question is outside of the BTC "Nakamoto" owns, his place in today's Bitcoin is somewhat irrelevant. It was founded on his ideas in the whitepaper and has evolved to what it is today. So it could be one person or a group, it doesn't matter(outside of the bitcoins).
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:21:36
This is exactly my question. Is it because they believe the price will reflect the increase in transaction capacity? That's the only thing that makes sense to me.

I just don't know why a storage site would cross your mind as being a good storage location if its not encrypted super securely especially with a strong password. Still I would advise using a hardware wallet or even a live usb over that. Especially with that kind of money. You even admitted it was a weak password. Exactly what were you thinking? That this 120,000 if it goes missing its backed by a government so I can get it back? I'm really not trying to be mean but it's just plain stupid. ESPECIALLY if its your savings. You have no one to blame but yourself and the only reason I would say this post shouldn't get removed is so people don't follow in your footsteps.
