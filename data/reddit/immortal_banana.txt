You have to cash out. When too many people cash out price tanks.

A coin you can actually send and recieve for no fees and doesnt take 12 hours to show up

Crypto is amazing tech. The way that handheld gaming is amazing tech but why would i be playing monochrome gameboy when I can emulate n64 games in a smartphone?

Top kek

Yea its a fork. You dont see bitcoin and bitcoin gold going at each others throats. Bitcoin is either scared of bcash or jealous.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:44:18
Yea but that takes like 6 months not 3 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:36:40

I assume they finish each others sentences and speak in rhyme

A currency's value lay in its ability to facilitate transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:38:38
And thats the way we like it.

I'll buy .000000000000001 btc at 340,000 $. 
Hope i can actually afford that
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:03:54
Cash under the mattress is a store of value.

Cant cash out usd on binance
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:07:21
Well i have a handfull of llcs, but guess what, if the government hit me with a 5 mi fine it wouldnt be a slap on the wrist. Corporations arent immune from the law, its the wealthy who are.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:04:41
Number 2 is the trick
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:47
I doubt they can cashbout entirely without crashing btc
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:37:00
Oh man i cant belive that! But how? What websitr would someone go to to learn how to do that? So i know what sites to avoid of course
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:18:28
Nothing really, just petty jealousy
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:31:43

@_date: 2017-12-18 18:37:12
Anyone can incorporate tho, thats easy
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:32:03
Not propogate cancer
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:57:52
Thats what i said
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:49:45
Whatre you doing making transactionns? Its a store of value not a currency!!!
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:43
Instead, grab the sword upright and then plunge it into your gut?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:34:17
Nah, the individual investors will need a buyout, and you know how the government loves to bailout its own taxpaying citizens. Lol jk taxpayers gfy

But Ltc is on coinbase, big advantage.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:47:27
No. Coinbasehas announced that BCH will be available for withdrawal tho
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:31:16
Thats not a good thing
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:40
Seems like coinbase is only allowing users to withdraw the bcc they are owed, not allowing people to purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:12:10
Bitcoun wasnt designed to be a store of value. People thought beanie babies were a store of value too. Being a store ofvalue may not be a bad thing but it is not a good thing for bitcoin.
