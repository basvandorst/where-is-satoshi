Sure, those will have taxes, but they won't cut you on %35 of what you originally had.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:12:57
Really? I thought capital gains tax was much higher then the sales tax

Would you be able tell me why people actually cash BTC out just to report it to the IRS? I'm not saying people should cash it and not report it, but why not keep it as BTC and just use it as that?

Do you have any idea what your password to it might be? I can't seem to think of any way to do this without just brute forcing it.

You are the most condescending person I've heard in awhile. You don't know her brother's mental state or what it was like for him. if they loved each other as much as they say she did he would probably want whats best for her.

Ah ok so I think I understand now, thanks again for telling me about limit orders, never knew about that and it'll be nice to get away from those pesky fees!
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:33:09
What does GDAX get out of this though not putting fees on it?
Thank you for telling me about this though, Ill probably start using it soon.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:33:41
wow im stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:11:34
Well i wouldn't be here if 70 bucks was the end of me. Win some lose some.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:57:33
I tried it, basically as soon as you invite 5 people it asks you to fill out some survey for verification.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:40:42
can you not promote your stupid refferal link and stop blatantly lying?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:38:13
Are you 0.045 is accurate for ETH?
That sounds awfully high for a phone.

It's not worth it at this point, Even mining with a cople ASIC's is futile at this point. Unless you essentially have an ASIC farm bitcoin mining isn't worth the effort.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:20:25
No im trading on gdax, i know coinbase has alot of fees
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:02:39
I haven't lost any yet gladly since i actually haven't sold/bought any just yet. And I only paid about 30 bucks for this so I'm really not too worried if I happen to lose some. I'm just curious why my sell price looks like it's getting jipped.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:57:50
That seems a little suspicious still, I know its a different coin but I only get about 4 dollars a day mining Monero. I feel a little self conscious now that a phone is almost keeping up with my computer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:02:01
I douubt it, but reply back anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:43:27
You should buy it on GDAX then transfer it wherever, GDAX has 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:24:28
Ok, last question before i think i fully understand this, if i want to sell 1 bitcoin at 18,000, will it only sell when the last market price hits 18000 or will it sell after i would normally get 18k per bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:46:14
I read up a little more on it and came acorss this page, I think you might be SOL (read bottom part under Data security)
Edit: Im retarded .  
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:44:28
Yea it does that, but it's nothing to worry about,
It's viewed as a pup since isometimes malware will sneak mining software on to your pc with your knowledge.
If you consciously download it yourself your good.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:45:18
No problem man! Wish someone told me that though cause I lost close to around 50-70 bucks buying on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:48:40
I saw you responded earlier to someone about finding it on the PC. If you still have the public I would assume the private key wouldn't have just disappeared. Try hooking it up and looking for this in the files. Wallet, wallet.dat, and a .wallet file and see if anything comes up. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:39:02
I've heard some good things about this one coin called electronium. But Currently the moble miner for that is down. Its supposedly hyped up as much as ripple is.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:13:17
Ok i get it for the most part.
But right now it says its at 17856 and if i say i want to sell 1 btc it says i can sell it for 17811, Does that mean everyone else is also only selling it for 17811 at that time?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:59:25
The site doesn't work, after you iinvite 5 people you get one of those "complete our survey" for verification"
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:51:14
Because I believe in innocence till proven guilty. Do you really think someone who just lose a brother/sister with a stable state of mind only sees their death as money? And why do *you* presume this women is just some asshole who only does what I just said?
You are such a sickening person.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:52:29
What's the difference between a hardware wallet and just regular ol' USB?
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:59:57
Yet it's against the rules and it's just fucking spammy. Such a disgrace you are.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:16:06
