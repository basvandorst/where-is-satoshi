Yeah I have 4 gpus as a hobby myself. There is an asics miner on Amazon that's 10th/s for 750$ I have been tempted to buy it but have not pulled the trigger

How so?
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:43:26
After they are all mined, do miners get payed out in fees? And I wonder what that will be like

I'll join!

ahhh see instead of issued depending on circumstances . Makes sense. Dont now a days they admit that the fort does not have as much gold as before or is it still a mystery? I don't think they let people in there lol

I'm no history buff by all means, I was referring to the first legal tender that was printed for the dollar. They had the USD before 1971 correct? If what your saying is true then what did they use before your date of 1971?

I don't pay electric, at least until December. But thanks for the input, the 750 was including power supply or something like that. I forget my electric cost here though it's not much. I live in southern us. And really if you mine and Bitcoin goes up over time can make the electric not as bad. I have to convince my wife first, that's the hard part! I was smart to buy a truck before the wedding but should have got a miner on the package ��������

I agree with the significance of this and agree inflation will destroy fiat, but the first USD was printed in 1862. That has been a long time

Fees are not irrelevant, they (ex: Western Union) take a lot of money if you transfer that much and time. But I agree global is good but also the speed

I have not updated yet, that would turn it on
