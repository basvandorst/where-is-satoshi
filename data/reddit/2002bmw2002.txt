I just signed up for Coinbase and bought $100K of BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:21:05
They didn't allow my US ID for a while, then they randomly started allowing it after a few months. I dunno, their ID verification system is retarded. Kraken worked fine for me, but their site is kinda sketchy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:07:09
They don't sell BCH at BTC prices. They sell at BCH prices. Currently around $1K?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:58:03
Sorry to be rude, but none of these analogies are good or necessary, TBH ;)
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:25:54
One person doesn't matter. There is &gt;21 billion dollars of support behind BCH currently. &gt;$1200 per coin, ~0.2 BTC. You guys said it would be dead on arrival. It's a serious risk to BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:50:52
They're using the BCH logo, not the BTC one (it's tiled to the left and has a white circle). As far as I'm concerned, there are two Bitcoins that are worth anything. They're both worth a lot. Chill and let the market decide. I put "Bitcoin" in quotes to stay neutral.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:33:18
What's the issue? If you buy BTC, you get BTC (on any major exchange). Tell people why BTC is better so they buy BTC. You could even ignore the tech and just say it's more popular, which makes it more viable.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:38:19
Their goal is definitely to make people consider BCH rather than BTC as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:53:38
Yeah. It was somewhat irritating, especially because they put it on a street pole.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:10:35
They are technically different in terms of what the network has to implement, but conceptually it's the same. You can treat the other changes as forks where nearly everyone went one way. Someone can always disagree with a change, and nobody has authority to decide which is the "the true Bitcoin" (other than maybe SN in a way, but he's gone if he ever existed). Hence why there are now two currencies that can call themselves "Bitcoin" and are both mined and traded heavily, and all we can do is promote ours. 
Anyway, I'm repeating myself at this point. It's a decentralized currency; stop treating it like fiat and name-calling like the banks and feds do.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:04:57
Why? No, I was just walking past on my way to work. And I only own BTC. Just letting you guys know that they're trying to take the Bitcoin name.

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:49:19
Look at the revision history. BTC has adopted changes in the past, none of them approved by SN, so it's not the original protocol either. It is also a fork. And for the last time, I don't own any BCH because I don't agree with it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:54:37
Well, I don't think he actually has any power to ban . But I'm a n00b on Reddit and could be wrong cause IDK how this site works.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:31:43
Great argument
Edit: This is exactly how you turn people away
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:54:09
They don't call it BTC. They have their own symbol. And since they forked from the same currency, I don't see what gives them any less claim to the name. The whole point of this stuff is that it's decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:15:36
How is this an attack?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:39:22
That's not a good analogy. Picasso paining means a painting made by Picasso. What does Bitcoin mean? There's no clear consensus and nobody to dictate it other than the market. We just need to make sure BTC ends up winning.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:07:45
If they became the majority fork, would you be complaining about BTC? That was/is their goal. I mean, I think BTC is the better technology, but some may disagree. You can and should fight back with your own ads. But just saying "we are the only Bitcoin" is also a lie, and it isn't going to convince anyone.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:30:27
"It is technically steal rather than open source." Forking isn't stealing, according to this license: 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:32:36
I don't really care enough to do that. I also don't know if it's exactly a lie or what.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:18:09
BTW, sorry for being unclear, but I definitely don't condone this ad. It's pretty devious. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:12:58
Not really. They're inferring that BCH is Bitcoin and don't mention BTC. Yeah, it's going to get non-savvy people to buy BCH, but this seems more like "not telling the whole truth" vs telling a lie. And the paragraph about the original Bitcoin is legit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:40:33
Then both BTC and BCH are altcoins by that reasoning. Oh, you're accusing me of promoting BCH? Why would I choose this subreddit of all places? I don't own any BCH and probably never will.
Edit to respond: There are 2 because there's nothing indicating which is the "real" one. There's no authority on this. Both have a lot of market value. The only arguments I've seen are either that "BTC is more popular" or "you're an idiot who needs to be banned".
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:18:02
Yeah, well guess what, two currencies DO claim the name (as evidenced in the poster and the entirety of r/btc), and you're only making it worse by ignoring the problem.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:44:46
I'm not trolling, but go ahead and do it
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:41:00
"Dumped months later" - Is that what you said a few months ago? That's what most people seem to think about all cryptocurrency in general. They say "pyramid scheme" or something.
I don't own BCH, but every time you insult people blindly like that, I wonder why I even hold BTC. Well, at least your money is (probably) where your mouth is. Or maybe the other way around.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:23:15
Venmo. No fees ever, unless you foolishly use a credit card. Doesn't matter which bank the recipient uses. It's the only thing I've ever used to pay individuals (other than cash), and I've even used it for businesses.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:29:42
That's only for credit cards, not debit. Also, whether or not I use credit card often times won't affect what I pay. Prices may be higher because others use credit card, but I can't control that. But some places have a discount for using cash, debit, or Venmo.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:20:13
Yeah, I've been there. r/btc is even gayer than this sub.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:25:18
Credit cards have fees. Debit cards don't, and many bank accounts don't. I've never paid for anything relating to my banking before, unless you count the opportunity cost of having to keep $1000 in my account.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:27:44
I don't care if people see which foods I buy. The only things I'd want to keep private is my firearms purchases, which I definitely can't keep private no matter what currency I use (background check info gets stored in some retard fed worker's PC that gets hacked), and maybe donations if I start doing that some day.
