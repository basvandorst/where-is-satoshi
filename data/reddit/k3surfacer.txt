This is the way forward. We are slow in teaching the governments. True. But we teach.

Enjoy life. The big extinction of homo sapiens is coming. Enjoy life.
Don't tell me there is a joy in investing.

We handle everything.

There is no function for bitcoin. It is just something you own and is expensive. You sell it when you need it. That's all.
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:21:29
No we don't need. But being decentralized it is open to manipulation, abuse and unfair influence.
We have seen two, sooner or later we will see unfair influence from entities many of us disrespect.

Non sense. The main point of crypto currency is decentralization. 
Transaction time and fee and ... are inevitable features to come with online trustless p2p transactions. Eventually.
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:45:08
Very good news.
@_date: 2018-10-14 10:38:26
Yes and No. Yes because I know decentralization is in essence freedom from selected authorities. Therefore Crypto is against all those ideologies.
No, because I want to know what is evidence for saying such a thing that in my mind and experience is the exact opposite.
Hint: I assume people don't make 100% wrong statements in public.

My comment was not for people who don't understand indirect messages.
Just stay at your own level.

Banks and Bitcoin don't come together. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 09:56:44
It is like that. The "housing bubbles" in history have shown this. Because a real house is never in a bubble. If in doubt, ask your child later.

Bitcoin is about well defined economy not about vaguely defined political systems.
If holding Bitcoin has positive effect on future economy as seen by politicians, it will be fine.
I mean: china sees Bitcoin as an important asset of future so it is good that its citizens have some coins.

15$ for 120$. This is worse than traditional swiss banks.

What is a moral compass? There is none. 
You come and call people moron and claim the one who has made a wrong assumption (about impossible 100% wrong public statements) consideres public speeches as fact. How should I react?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:15:42
It is almost certain that market cap of bitcoin will raise. But the actual raise start when we pass 10k$. Before that it is still a normal asset. I predict a very aggressive raise starts in less tgan 2 years. Note that we are still in normal 10$ jumps. After 10000 we shall see 100$ jumps very often. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:37:56
Interesting. The rise was phenomenal.
@_date: 2018-10-14 10:00:18
What is the evidence? I am a bit concerned. I don't want to be part of any community with those ideologies.

Difficult to manage. Too far away.

Buy slowly. Try to be identify dips and put limit orders. But buy each time slowly.
@_date: 2018-06-03 10:02:29
That's workable.
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:13:23
No. They should not. Because "money" isn't about spelling. It is about spending.
No /s was meant.
@_date: 2019-04-14 08:21:56
Crypto currency, but centralized versions of it. Decentralization is only a good dream of masses and therefore an impossibility.
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:47:37
People fail. Bitcoin doesn't.
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:10:14
Good. Bitcoin replacing dollar in internet? I like that.
But I stick to my Platinum replacing anything worth a damn thing,  that is ETH. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:44:06
This level of misunderstanding is amazing.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:10:32
Bitcoin can in fact go back to 2 millions (of USD cents).
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:33:17
The list is long. But
1. Ico: a new version of startups (abusing it is no eth fault)
2. ETH right now is the best secure, anonymous, cheap, fast money transaction system that can be used. Individuals are doing this.
3. Ethereum's smart contract is in fact "programming" your fund. 
4. Ethereum can *in principle* give programmable version of *any* economical tool currently in use: like voting, staking, lending, borrowing, money monitoring, ownership proof, ... Anything.

My post didn't claim anything about the price of bitcoin. It is my understanding that
1. Bitcoin will survive. Therefore it must go higher according to Elliot. It may eventually be "pegged" to a certain fixed amount of fiat and stay there.
2. Since Bitcoin is intrinsically useless, other crypto assets (the superior ETH for now) will replace the never fulfilled promises of Bitcoin. Those assets not only survive but will also have different fiat values all the time.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:39:19
Think again. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:51:55
It has the same problem: backing is "in theory only". If someone collected those coins for years and came one day and order 1 million big macs? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:37:49
Bitcoin will survive forever because the world needs something that is not as vulnerable as a flag.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:05:06
Math symbols? Well you just confessed not to have any idea whatsoever about
1. Math
2.  The Bitcoin whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:15:26
Easy to solve. Change unit of account and then new currencies. Once in place take the pair "new currency/old currency" rate to a ridiculously high number.
Done.
