BTC is not currently viewed  as a currency by the investing public, but instead as a store of value / investment tool/commodity just like precious metals. High volatility appeals to traders but not to serious investors such as 401ks, indexes and ETFs. They want steady, sustainable growth without many surprises.
Thus, most corporations and platforms have had a hands-off attitude toward BTC. If there was a consistently steady track record, then they wouldn't care that they don't understand it -- much like how people are unbothered by not being well-versed in the intricacies of the Internet's infrastructure and protocols. But to be both volatile (wildly so, it's penny-stock volatile) and completely mysterious? Too much for them to handle.
The thing is, *we need their money* to help BTC get to 100K per coin. Wall Street's involvement should bring legitimacy and self-assurance to the mainstream in due time. In other words, HODL

You gotta pay taxes after making money lol. But Coinbase allows you to buy up to $700 daily without the ID verification. You still need to add your address and last 4 of your SSN (for U.S. residents) though.

The point is that people shouldn't make panic decisions based on comments from CEOs who are clueless on the intricacies of the industries he/she is criticizing.
If your investment strategy involves putting more money than you can afford on cypto in this current climate, then you're a straight-up idiot. Best of luck to you.
