I also had it drop on me after I bought, got in at €300, but it dropped to around half the price, and I also was pretty stressed about throwing away (which seemed like, oh young, dumb me) a lot of money back then.

You seem to know more about this; how does one calculate the inflation? Say I print billions of dollars (let’s say I can), but don’t make that public. Now I am worth billions of dollars and nobody knows that I printed that money.
When does inflation happen? If I don’t spend it, nobody will ever know. If I spend it, how does inflation happen exactly? Let’s say I buy a bigg-ass mansion (or whole county) worth 500 million dollars, will the guys at the banks now “uh oh here’s some new money flooding in”? What happens if I buy more and more food? Let’s say I spend lots and lots of money on food (or something else that competes with most people), will someone at a bank notice then?

What you say is correct for Bitcoin, but not necessarily for all blockchains. Chainz like Monero hide (or try to hide) as much information about a transaction as possible.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:41:42
The transactions up until the fork will be the same for BTC and BU.
Because the adresses are in the exact same format (same private key to public key conversion algorithm), you will have control over both the BTC and BU coins for all adresses you own.
You should see a fork as a branch on a tree. The trunk is shared, while the new branch is different from another branch.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:24:49
You would only see what happened on your side of the fork, you would need a BU wallet to check on your BU coins.

What does UASF stand for?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:18:47
Yes and probably. It depends on how the BU team will mitigate the replay attack.
There currently is a danger of a replay attack, because the implementations of Bitcoin and BU are nearly the same. This means that if you perform a transaction on one side of the fork, that same transaction can be broadcast on the other side of the fork and be accepted.
In their announcement, the exchanges are saying that they will list BU as an altcoin, if and only if this replay attack problem can be mitigated.
My hope is the BU team is not competent enough to mitigate this, and fails in their attempt to drill Bitcoin into the ground (which is imo what they are doing; my hopes are on segwit &amp; the Bitcoin Core team to help mitigate the scaling problem).

@_date: 2017-08-12 20:34:46
This is probably caused by the node rebooting. 
If it is not, there could have been a lot of transactions with rbf that spend the same output. When one of them enters a block, all the other transactions cannot go through and are cleared from the mempool.
But I am pretty sure that this is caused by a node reboot.

You're saying as if the miners are whining little babies, but I'd like to remind you that miners are also just people like you that want to help the Bitcoin network.
Yes some of them are bad actors, but most of them are people like you and me that just have 1 or 2 miners. These people have invested money into something that might bring them money.

I think either he really thinks that BU is superior to Segwit (it's not, Segwit opens the door to LN, which is a better long-term solution than bigger blocks).
Or he has a hidden agenda with things like ASICBOOST and Antbleed that will help him in achieving his goal of owning the Bitcoin network.
If it's the former, he should be informed by the core devs, not scolded by pro-core anti-BU people. If it's the latter, he should understand that to have the Bitcoin network equals to kill the Bitcoin network.

Okay, but I have not seen a resolution for that, with segwit/the other proposed fixes, large pools are still possible.
@_date: 2017-04-04 14:09:37
Nope, hash rate can increase, and can show a much bigger increase in BU mining power than core (suggesting Roger is buying miners).
Blocks are capped at one each 10 minutes, so increasing hashpower for BU means less blocks for Core.

I don't understand why a PoW would be so widely suggested. Every miner in Bitcoin invested money in their miners, they will not simply throw those machines away. They will keep mining the old coin, and nobody can stop them. The new PoW coin will be an altcoin.

I just don't get how Roger Ver, owner of at least 40k BTC on one address sees it as a good idea to destroy the idea it was built upon.
If bitcoin becomes too centralized, the price drops. If bitcoin becomes fully centralized, there will be a pow change and it will start over completely. Both of those things are very bad things for the price of bitcoin.
The only thing that might be a good idea is if he has no idea that the price will drop or he has massive amounts of BTC in short positions, so that if BTC is worth 0 dollars, he has more money than he has now. But I'd doubt that.

Hashing is a one way process, this takes in some data and outputs a number.
In a hood hashing algorithm, changing a little in the input data changes a lot in the output number.
What miners are doing is hashing the data in the block they want to produce, together with a number, called the nonce.
The miner picks a random nonce, adds it to the data and hashes it. The output number has to be lower than a specific "target" (which is linked with the difficulty). The lower the target number, the more a miner has to try to find a number that fits that block.
Once this nonce has been found, the block is solved and released to be verified by all other nodes on the network.
Now, ASICBOOST, as I understand it, gives an advantage to the miner to "prehash" (hashing is done in multiple steps) the block data, so that he does not have to do this part again. Then he changes the nonce and prehashes this nonce and then performs the final steps to become the hash.
This causes the miner to not having to prehash part of the block again, thus causing a 30% boost.
Now the problem: this is efficient for normal blocks, but even more efficient for empty blocks. Empty blocks do not help shorten the list of waiting transactions. Thus they have to be avoided as much as possible.
ASICBOOST incentives empty blocks, which is why it should be eliminated.
Also, segwit changes the composition of the block which makes ASICBOOST no longer effective.
Fyi, I don't know if all this is correct, but that is the gist.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:21:10

@_date: 2017-05-30 06:56:51
This. So much this.
They don't seem to understand that 2MB blocks are not sufficient for Visa-level transaction volume, neither is 4MB.
I did some quick calculations and the number I come up with is 720MB.
2000 transactions/second * 60 seconds/minute * 10 minutes/block = 1.2 million transactions/block
1,200,000 transactions/block * 600 bytes/transaction = 720 million bytes/block = 720MB/block
We want Visa-level transaction volume. The only variable in this calculation is the amount of bytes per transaction. Segregated Witness reduces this to around 250-300 bytes per transaction.
That is obviously not enough, but it is a big step in the right direction. Making blocks bigger only pushes the problem forward.

Dang man, haven't you heard of Monero? It's awesome �� 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:26:11
Yup, so activate Segwit asap so LN can be tested. Bigger blocks might be needed in the future, but segwit optimizes the way transactions are put in blocks, so it also kind of is a block increase.

Oh the UASF is enforcing signalling readyness? Not actual SegWit? That puts my mind at ease. I was going over all sorts of problems with a giant fork between BIP148 and vanilla Core nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:40:05
No and I am not stating that you are stupid, I just think you don't fully get my point. In my mind segwit is the best we currently have, and I haven't heard any compelling arguments against segwit. If you have any, please do.
Why I think segwit is our best option:
 - It decreases bandwidth per transaction, thus increasing transactions per MB.
 - It increases max MB per block (well it still enforces the 1 MB, but it doesn't include the witness data in that size calculation), to allow for even more transactions.
 - It has been deployed and rigorously tested on the testnet for over a year.
 - It solves some smaller issues like transaction malleability.
I can't see why you would want a jump in blocksize when you have this tested software that also increases amount of transactions per block.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:45:13
6k for a Bitcoin ATM seems like a good deal. You should definitely try to push people towards Bitcoin. Only ask them to pay in dollars after you told them the amount in millibits (I’d go with millibits, as it is around $2-3).
Do you have a website or app that you can use to display the prices for drinks or internet usage (using the current Bitcoin price) &amp; allow payment to you?
I’d also place a screen in the bar somewhere that displays the current Bitcoin price and a nice graph of the recent price fluctuations.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:55:54
My best guess is BTC will go up before the fork, because people are moving other currencies to BTC to offload to their own wallets. Then people will dump their BCC, so it will go down very rapidly.
Please watch out for the SegWit replay attack! There is a ‘bug’ (? Not sure what to call it) in BCC that allows BCC miners to send your BCC to an address of their choice. They can do this if you perform a SegWit transaction on the BTC network, they take the BTC transaction you broadcasted on the BTC network, and include it in a block with another transaction that immediately moves those BCC to their own address of choice. BTC network is unaffected, they can only do this with BCC because they fucked up (or intentionally put it there??? The plot thickens). [Source](

I didn't know about only the sw -&gt; sw transactions getting a discount, but if so, you have a point and increasing the blocksize will improve that.
On the other hand, I'm pretty sure quite a lot of users will switch to sw transactions (if it's not by default sw in their wallet).

OP, in their title.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:52:25
I don’t know the entire thing, but I think that private -&gt; public key is only a hash, so if SHA 256 is broken, isn’t it possible to generate collisions or to just reverse the operation?
Also, if mining is broken, then everything is broken. Everyone could create a block by simply reversing the hash and picking a working nonce.
You seem to know more about this than I do, please correct me if I’m wrong.

Yes, but it doesn't matter if the owner of the pool gets to choose what they do with the hashing power.
If the pools are composed of many different people, and the pool decides to perform a 51% attack, the people will leave the pool very quickly. If the pool is just one person or entity, then they won't and the pool may succeeed in performing the 51% attack.

UASF will enforce signalling readyness and orphan all blocks not signalling SegWit. So after aug 1 for UASF nodes all blocks will be SegWit. For core nodes, I hope that all blocks mined will be signalling SegWit, otherwise we might be getting a fork.
