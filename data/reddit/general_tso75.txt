I would love to have your job where you can wait for enough data points to make decisions based on having statistical significance :)
My background is in Industrial/Organizational psychology.  This argument plays out quite a bit between people working in the field and academia.  Bottom line: CEOs and CHROs don't typically do statistically significant analysis to make business decisions.  As in this case, you have a hypothesis (Correlation of price between BTC and Futures dates) and have to make a decision.  The information available is what it is.
That being said we can probably make a pretty penny publishing reports on the different correlations on prices and major swings.

Maybe he said 2009.

It might not be statistically significant, but it doesn’t mean it’s not happening and beginning a trend.  Waiting on a full data set could cost money.

I'm not mad.  I recounted a story.  I think everyone else got mad from the looks of it.

Annoying assholes like you is a pleasure in life.

You clearly lack reading comprehension skills if you got stalking or worshipping out of that.

And BTC price has everything to do with the price of tea in China.

If I take three steps forward, I’m trending toward a direction.  If my baby only eats apple sauce for three days straight that’s a trend.  If my wife cheats on me three times in a year, that’s a trend.  If you ignore information or delay decisions waiting for statistical significance to confirm your hypothesis there is an opportunity cost in the real world.  A trend is movement in a general direction.  It doesn’t, by definition, have to be statistically significant.  You might be looking at it from the bubble of linear trend estimation, but I’m semantically zoomed out.

How is having the former director of digital currency at MIT’s Media Lab so sketchy to you?
