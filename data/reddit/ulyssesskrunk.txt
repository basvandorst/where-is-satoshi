It's just one hoop. 


Literally one time and then everybody will believe him forever.


1 is all that is needed.


Yet he refuses to prove this. If he could prove he has access to a single one of those keys, this could all be over.
This dude is delusional as fuck. Does he think we think it would be hard for satoshi to prove who he is? Everybody here knows how trivially simple it would be for satoshi to come out and provide incontrovertible evidence of who he is.

This is a terrible analogy. Things exist that can protect you when you have sex, but there is no way for you to be safe wih your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:56:59
If this turns out to be the case, then holy shit.

@_date: 2016-08-26 16:23:38
Okay sure, some exchanged have stds, but my point is that in the bitcoin world thiere is no condom.
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:25:37
Yeah totes. Just talked to my psychic and she said the same thing.
@_date: 2016-08-20 09:40:29
Ditto. Got into bitcoin early 2013, was already annoyed by about the circljerk over how shitty mt gox was. What's funny is there was an equally strong circlejerk over btc-e and how they can't be trusted. Funny how that worked out.

What the fuck are you smoking dude? The dollar amount is completely irrelevant as it's arbitrary by definition.


Yes, because percent changes are all that matter. 


No, it's literally the only reasonable way to compare volatility.

In the image at the top you can see a mini quadcopter in the middle, that isn't on the list tho. Anyway, I just bought that a few days ago. It shipped yesterday, buying was trivially simple, so far I've had a good experience. Would recommend.
@_date: 2016-04-13 04:22:26
The fuck is that?
@_date: 2016-04-18 18:55:15


Fucking yes. How is that so hard to understand? You're acting like 1 Bitcoin is comparable to 1 Euro which is retarded as hell. That's like saying gold in pounds is more volatile than gold in ounces because the swings are greater in dollar values even if they change by the same percent.
What if somebody is using millibits instead? Boom, that's magically 1/1000^th as volatile as Bitcoin. No, that's not how that works.
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:29:58

They have a long history of closing people's accounts for basically no reason and giving people the run around. People who have used the site for years and have thousands or more stored on there, just closed without warning. And apparently they make it a huge pain in the ass to get money out after they closed your account. But really it just comes down to you not being in control of your coins, that's just something you should never do. I would say that maybe buying from them is safe enough, but only if you don't buy close to the limit because they'll close your account, or buy things with the coins, because they may close your account, and definitely move them out asap.
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:51:02
No he didn't, he asked a real question that has a genuine answer. There are valid reasons for a company like this to hold the bitcoin rather than holding it yourself. Having gbtc hold the bitcoin is literally nothing at all like having somebody else control your private key instead of you. It's just converting the Bitcoin way of finance into the current scheme, which has protections that Bitcoin doesn't, allowing you to invest like a stock without having to deal with what is now a significant tech barrier for a vast majority of people.
Don't whine just because you didn't understand something.
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:46:49
That's not how that works. Everybody's scores are hidden for a set amount of time.
@_date: 2015-12-21 06:09:32
That doesn't make Andreas wrong tho. If the foundation is more about keeping itself alive at the cost of hurting the Bitcoin community then they should lose legitimacy. I certainly don't want people to focus on keeping their jobs more than benefiting the tech. I don't know if that applies here, but it sounds like it might.

Freemasons. The lizard men headed by Charlemagne that control the Jews that control the world. The only way to bring about the end times of fiat was via direct actions from the masons. The idea had been tried before by non masons until one day, shortly after a failed attempt by a group of rebel bankers that causes the great recession, a mason decided it took their great organization's power to accomplish it and in a moment of realization he exclaimed "Aah, it took masons!" and then some smart ass aspy freemason just started mumbling anagrams because he's weird like that and when he said "Satoshi Nakamoto" it caught everybody's attention, and thus the name stuck.

The thing is though he wouldn't have to. As I understand it he acquired them for no monetary payment, so he has no cost basis, meaning it's all profit, which would need to be reported, but not until he converts to fiat. Basically even if he does have a billion dollars worth of bitcoin, it's not illegal.

Yeah, it seems like they did 1.55/1.05 without any consideration to what the actual numbers mean. They have to pay 50% more now. If the value dropped by 50% they would have to pay 100% more. Seems like the writer of this isn't very good at math.

This always happens though. Non technical upper management jumping in whatever bandwagon they heard that morning while the tech people who actually know what they're talking about try to get their bosses to see reason.

Not really, it's just that having a paper wallet that is actually made of paper is super vulnerable to so much. I wouldn't even consider a cold wallet safer than a hot wallet unless it's in made of something that could survive a fire and a building collapsing on it.

That was true for Gox too, yet they became insolvent due to shady ass market timing attempts. I doubt Coinbase is doing any of that, overall they seem pretty trustworthy, but it is possible.

Well let me enlighten you, it's wrong. Everything done with dollars and cents should always be done entirely in integers and that should be the same way with BTC, because perfect accuracy matters. To get .22% of something no floats should be involved. The BTC should be multiplied by the desired precision(200 in this case since .22 is 2 decimal places) and the would be float(.22) should be stored as an integer(22). All math is then done with ints, no floats, just multiplying/dividing by 10 for perfect accuracy every time.

If it's successful and they build a little distributed market on campus of things being bought and sold primarily for Bitcoin, then I think that will be an example of you giving people freedom to do things with Bitcoin can only help make it stronger. Maybe than this sub can rally behind BTC instead of USD/BTC

Fifo is the default if you cannot easily distinguish between specific ones. So if I buy BTC several times and send them all to the same address, it would be treated as fifo upon selling, but if I send them to separate addresses, I must then use the cost basis for each one because that information because it is available. 
But honestly, as long as you are consistent and not fraudulent, the IRS will be fin with fifo.

Unfortunately it also represents a serious problem that will drastically slow Bitcoin's adoption. 
What's the fastest way to get a bunch of people interested in a cryptocoin and hopefully cause a spike in price? A big publicity stunt, like sponsoring a racecar or pro fighter. 
What's the best way to build an infrastructure of tools that help make Bitcoin easier to use and likely more prevalent and accessible in society? Fund young tech startups and hackathons to rapidy develop and spread uses for it.
Which one do you think the people who have millions invested are going to go for? The quick pump and dump of 5 minutes of fame, simply because it's quick and easy, even though OP's idea would, imo, be better for Bitcoin in the long run, but we need to fund it somehow, and the rich want to go another direction so it's harder to do.
I personally took a cryptography course this semester and did a big project on Bitcoin that we presented to the class. I want these people, CS majors, the ones who either have or soon will have the means to expand infrastructure, to get interested, and thankfully a bunch were, but it's only so much.

If it wasn't worth it, nobody would do it. The diff would go down and then when it became worth it people would mine. if it was still worth it when the diff went up then more people would mine until it was no longer worth it. That process would theoretically repeat until it reached the limit where it was just barely worth it to net the tiniest of profit, and only then would it be worth it for the people with the cheapest power. Eventually it would be mined solely by those with the cheapest power and become effectively centralized. 
So, is it worth it? Maybe, but if so it won't be tomorrow, then it will, then it won't, then Bitcoin will die. Such is the life of a proof of work system.

Why move it to brake a single day off of a month, when they could have had it end tonight at midnight so it's between June and July?

It's faster in the sense that you are guaranteed the money in months less time than by using a cc, that to me would more than counteract the few extra seconds it takes to verify BTC vs a cc. And safety I meant that customers aren't able to do chargebacks or contest the purchase in any way. And as for the theft, those have only happened to companies that improperly store BTC for extended time,  that can be completely avoided by converting to fiat at the time of transaction which would still be cheaper than typical cc fees.

It's well known, at least among economists, that Britain is far better off in an economic sense if they stay rather than exit. Basically it would be like if there was a direct vote in the US to make minim um wage for the whole country $15 or set the max rent for any apartment at say $800. It would get popularity among some of the uneducated populace, but they would be downright moronic among people who actually understand economics. Brexit has a very strong consensus for being a terrible terrible result for Britain.

I get what you were saying, don't worry. 
Sigma is standard deviations. So what you want to do is find what value of x makes the area under [the curve]( e^(-(x^2 /2&amp; = .99989130421, it's [3.87 sigma.](
Now I bet you want to know what % is needed for 5 sigma don't you? Well you just find the area under that curve from -5 to 5. It's [99.9999942667...%]( by default it shows all nines, you have to click mre digits to get the precision). 
Now, just how long would it take to get such an uptime? Well, assuming no more downtime than was taken into account for the title (6h, 20m I believe) that would be [1.10413*10^7 hours]( or [1260.4 years]( which is [Wednesday, May 29, 3269](
So there is your daily lesson on math. Of course using standard deviations in this way isn't exactly standard, I certainly thought it was fun. BTW I am totally stealing your 5 sigma comment on May 29, 3269. If Bitcoin is still around. And I'm immortal.

No, people do argue that it doesn't work for buying coffee. It's mostly because bitcoin is not instant. You can send the transaction out immediately but until the next block you can't be 100% sure the coins weren't double spent.

The encoding stats at 00000000 but the first bunch are of non letter characters. Look at the pic on that page. The all caps ones in the beginning are non printed characters that control stuff, then it gets to special characters and then finally numbers and letters. 
All characters start with a 0 then it goes b7...b1. Those are the 1s and 0s on the top and bottom. So look at a letter in the reddit pic, ignore the beginning 1 then note the first 3 numbers. Find that sequence of numbers in the wiki pic at the top, then note the final 4 numbers in the reddit pic and find those on the left of the wiki pic. Where that row and the previous column intersect is the letter encoded.

What I find even more sad is that people gave him the benefit of the doubt to begin with.

The people defending him now are probably the same idiots who were using Mt Gox when it died and are just delusional.

@_date: 2015-03-21 06:01:35
This isn't fucking complicated, dumbass. How are you not understanding this? It's so simple. In the end they would just have 1 million addresses with coins that could have come from dozens of different original addresses each. What's so hard to understand about that.
And when I said a million tumblers I worded that poorly. I meant that they tumble each increment separately such that it takes 1 million total sends to the tumbler.
@_date: 2016-05-05 06:18:59

I know, but it would have been way safer to tumble them slowly over the course of months or years rather than trying to do them all at once like this.

@_date: 2015-11-16 19:28:53
That's not how the pigeonhole principle works. The mere fact that you aren't sure of the answer to the second question shows just how wrong. Pigeonhole would require that every address can have only a finite number of private keys and that there are enough private keys total such that every address must have a private key.
What you're talking about is just basic probability.

That gives redundancy that cash can't have, which is good for things like fire and disaster, but it can still be stolen. Better is to break it into n parts such that you need k of n to get the whole key. Like have 5 pieces and with any 3 you can make the key, that way you're less likely to lose to theft, tho more likely to lose to disaster than 5 copies, but you get protection in both regards compared to a single copy.

@_date: 2015-03-10 21:28:37
That doesn't really matter in this case though. He said they would immediately convert to fiat and while that's vague, I think he is implying using a service like coindesk of bitpay where you can set a price in dollars, have them convert that to BTC to charge your customer and then deliver to you the dollar value minus their fees, so even though it can happen over the course of minutes the whole transaction uses the same exchange rate so it won't matter.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:42:56
But that's the point, there are so many shady people in bitcoin it would be stupid to trust any one person, even Gavin, when it comes to something like this. Not only because it goes against the entire heart of bitcoin's trustless nature, but because if Wright really were Satoshi it would be so trivially easy to prove it. According to Gavin he still has access to the info from the first block, so why is he so reluctant to just sign a message and release it publicly?
We should all remain skeptical of any individual claims until actual proof is presented.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:36:57


He's not. Why would you think he is? He hasn't done anything related to Bitcoin in years, he could be dead for all anybody knows.

Unless you count redditors. Let me tell you as somebody who was around these subreddits before Gox went belly up, people were bashing the shit out of them for as long as I was around. I joined the community in mid 2013 and people were saying that Gox was slow and shady as fuck and to not trust them. It just kept getting worse over time too. Anytime Gox came up there was nothing but negativity and advice to not use it. People weren't blind sided when Gox imploded. Most had been predicting it. Only the delusional had not yet moved their coins.

No, literally any tumbler would work. I'm not saying they do it all at once, they should have held all the coins tumbling a small amount each time over however long it took to tumble them all into several million different addresses. The whole thing could have been automated and running on a raspberry pi for a few months. Tumbling isn't exactly complicated.

Not the same coin to a million different addresses. Do you seriously not have any clue how tumbling works?

Well according to Gavin he did have the keys and used it to prove he was satoshi to gavin a while ago. If that's true he can simply do it again. If he doesn't have the keys then gavin was tricked and it is literally impossible for him to prove he is satoshi.

There are very detailed guides out there. It sounds like you are taking your time so you do everything right, that's good. Don't rush it, things like electrum/blockchain.info are secure enough for short term storage or if you want to trade, I just wouldn't keep a bulk of my coins in them for too long.
Just be careful and remember to make a physical backup in case anything happens. There could be a solar flare or a bomb or something that wipes all your data. Very unlikely, but it isn't hard to make a backup out of a metal plate that can survive that, an earthquake, a fire, a flood, etc. I may sound paranoid, but it's easy to be extra precautions so why not be?

You could double a max of 19 times with that. The odds of winning in 19 or less tries is greater than 50% if the number of possible outcomes is at most, 19, because E(x) = 1/p, assuming each possibility is equally likely. 
You would need to adjust the interval based on the number of possible outcomes.

Cool, there was a comment about long sleeve shirts, any word on those? Also, I don't want to sound like an idiot but... how does the sizing chart work? I viewed the source and it does nothing more than show a few pictures and it doesn't do anything.
BTW the last picture (the chick) that image is flipped on the vertical axis. I don't know why, but I saw that the B was tilted in the opposite direction of the other pictures and that's apparently how significant something must by in order for me to investigate further. The camera on the iPhone is on the wrong side, which just confirmed my suspicions. Just thought that was interesting.

I don't think you do, the number of Bitcoins being generated won't change at all.
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:46:45
When you do it through Bitfloor it sends the money to them and then you can use it to buy Bitcoins through them. You then have your Bitcoins in their online wallet, you can then transfer them to any Bitcoin address, including an offline wallet or another online wallet. Look into cold wallets for secure long term storage.

I wonder if there is a group of users who remain not affected.
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:15:32
I believe the concepts you're looking for are stop loss and buy stop.
If you try to buy coins above the market price or sell bellow the market price, your order will execute and you'll end up with more coins or money than you would if you order had been executed the way you set it up, like your experiment showed.
With a stop loss order, which I don't think Mt.Gox supports yet, you can sell for a price that is lower than the current price and it won't execute until the price drops to that level. The point of this is to sell your coins before the price drops too much. 
Say you have some coins and you think the price might crash tonight, you would make a stop loss order to protect yourself. You could make an order that says "if the price drops to $63, sell 20 Bitcoins". Of course you could sell them now for more, but if the price rises, you lose money. This way, you only sell if the price drops, it's a fail safe.
A buy stop order is the same thing but with buying. If you think the price might go up, you create a buy stop order saying "if the prices rises to $75 buy 20 Bitcoins". This way you don't invest right away, only if the price is already going up.

@_date: 2013-04-02 02:33:01
Ha, good one. You are joking right? The only way this would work is if you have documentation to prove you bought the coins and documentation to show that you lost the coins through no fault of your own. This means you have to do it through a reputable exchange (Mt.Gox, Coinbase, etc), and they have to somehow lose your coins. If you take them out of that exchange then you can't do it, otherwise you could move them and claim you lost them and that's worth shit. If you buy it from somebody in person, then there's no formal record unless you get it notarized but nobody does that.
This tip only works if a major exchange that's legally recognized for Bitcoins get hacked or otherwise loses your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:44:21

@_date: 2013-11-20 13:30:34
All you seem to be doing here is trying to pass the blame off on others. Trusting your coins to 3^rd party services was your own mistake. Spending your coins online doesn't require you to give them to somebody else to hold. One of the main benefits of Bitcoin is that people can be in complete control of their coins without limiting their ability to spend them. You can keep your coins in cold storage or locally on your computer and send them directly to people you wish to do business with with no middleman. 
A fiat based stock exchange is trustworthy because of its size and regulation. Bitcoin is far smaller than USD so if people pull scams like this, the backlash will be smaller. The lack of regulation means there is no government insurance, this is the downside to having the freedom to COMPLETELY store and spend your money all by yourself. With great power comes great responsibility. Given the ability to control our own money in its entirety means we have to accept the consequences of any stupid mistakes we make.
As for basic-mining, imo things like this won't exist in a few years. If they do they will have to backed by an independent insurer and the premium would be paid for by the money the mining company could save through economies of scale from all the combined purchasing power of many investors. Right now there is really no way to stop stuff like this from happening, it is essentially a ponzi scheme that can be run stably of a constant group of investors, but the incentive to exploit it like this is just too huge for this system to survive.
This, to me, shows the biggest problem with the Bitcoin economy right now. User created infrastructure. It is often mediocre and doing things can be difficult, time consuming, or risky. This isn't a problem with Bitcoins, it's just something that is inevitable starting out small. Until we can make things that can mediate risk without forcing users to give up control, I don't how it will be done, but we'll see, people need to realize that nobody can save them if they make a mistake and get scammed because of it.
TL;DR Man up to your mistake and take responsibility for your investments and control of your BTC.

For the record, Bitinstant is only the best in terms of convenience. The charge high fees but can be used in person at a shit load of places. I recommend Bitfloor, low fees, fast, and easy to buy with cash, only thing is you'll need to be near a Bank of America.

That's exactly what I'm saying, E5 just means you multiply by 10^5 which adds 5 zeros to the end so 10E5 is 10 times E5 so it's 1E^6, 10 with 5 zeros after it.
I know that the coefficient is supposed to be between 1 and 10, but even if it's not the math doesn't change, it's just not simplified properly.

True the barrier of entry is far smaller with cryptocurrency but when one gets big enough the only way another can grow is if it has something that the others don't, otherwise there is very little incentive for store owners to accept it with such a smaller market share.

I usually buy from them and then send my Bitcoins to Btc-e, they usually have some better prices and I have easy access to other currencies as well (litecoin, namecoin, etc.).
When buying locally though, the prices are usually a good bit higher than the current market price but that's what you pay for convenience.

A lot of places, it's very easy to do. Of course then you are basically giving somebody else your private key. I would suggest DIY, a few bucks for the stamps, letters/numbers on metal rods, then you just hit them with a hammer to mark a sheet of metal, which can be gotten at many hardware stores.

@_date: 2013-07-17 22:20:08


It would just be high entropy if it's longer and more complex. So if you want a complicated key, it would be higher entropy.
I get that checking is the easy part,  I'm saying that because generating the keys is the hard part if you have to make more keys it will take longer. Also if you want a key with a specific complicated pattern in it, you will need to keep making keys longer to find it. Therefor more keys will be created the higher the entropy of the pattern, thus it will take longer.
Also regexes are the shit, you can't praise them too highly.

Wow, I completely misunderstood where multiple addresses come from, thanks for clearing that up. So if you have a wallet and there's a button that says "Generate a new address", or something to that effect, it makes a new private key and then hashes it for the new address, right? I still don't understand what a public key is, you send funds to an address which corresponds to a private key so what is a public key used for?
@_date: 2013-03-17 08:28:23
No, you don't understand. I bake them so that they turn to ash, this makes it so that they don't appear valuable to any who may fall upon them. Also, if a place where I am storing them burns down I can use carbon dating to distinguish my Bitcoin as from other ashes. I don't quite know how to reconstitute the ash into a paper that I can read, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it :)

I meant in the time it takes to actually convert money to Bitcoins with the verification process is more than the the difference in fees would save you. Most people see the low fees and think it's the cheapest way to buy but it's often not. 
You could try Bitinstant, though they've been having some problems lately, they let you deposit at a crap load of locations from Jewel-Osco to 7-Eleven. or you could try localbitcoins.com usually a little over market value, but it's fast, and if you do it right, relatively secure.

This is the best advice I can give. You *can* make more money by trading constantly and price obsessing, but it's too much for me. I just hold my coins and fantasize about when they'll be worth millions. It may never happen, but it makes me never want to sell, because I "know" it will always go up so holding will get me more in the end.

Okay, imagine that there is a dollar, and everything you want costs a lot more than 1 dollar. Say you want to buy a pizza, it cost 100 dollars. Eventually however, more people start using the dollar, demand goes up and supply stays the same. Now a pizza costs 1 dollar because the dollar is so valuable. If this keeps happening, eventually 1 dollar would buy *more* than 1 pizza. The problem is that the smallest unit of currency available is 1 dollar. The people using the dollar realize this and decide that a good way to solve the problem is to divide the dollar into smaller parts. Now the dollar is still worth the same, 1 dollar still buys 2 pizzas, but if you just want 1 pizza you could give them .5 dollars because now the smallest unit is .1 dollars.
Adding more precision didn't decrease the value of the dollar it just made it possible to spend less than 1 dollar.
Say that there are 1 million dollars, that's all there can ever be, so if more people use it, demand goes up and the value of each dollar increase. Since you can't make any more dollars you decide to break it down into smaller pieces. It would be exactly the same as giving everybody who own a dollar 9 times the amount of dollars they own so that if you have 1 dollar, now you have 10. What adding a decimal place does is essentially makes there be 10 million of a new currency, a decidollar which replaces the old system of the dollar such that 10 decidollars is worth exactly 1 dollar.
What the fed is doing is creating more dollars but not distributing them fairly, if they gave everybody an amount of dollars based on the amount of dollars people already have then the only effect would be that prices would go up and peoples money would increase to exactly offset this. This is not happening so what is going to happen is the price of everything is going to go up and people will have the same amount of money and they can buy less then they could before.
The important thing to distinguish here is that what the fed is doing is causing the real value of the dollar to drop, that is it will make it cost more dollars to buy the same amount of pizza. Whereas adding another decimal place doesn't do that because it essentially multiplies the amount of money available by 10 and then replaces everybody's money with 10x the new money which is worth .1x the old. This makes it so that prices don't change with respect to the old but they cost 10x as much in the new which, because it's worth .1x the old, completely cancels out.
Sorry for the wall of text, but people are trying to sum this up concisely and I think explaining it in full with examples will help you grasp it better. Just remember that breaking a Bitcoin down into smaller pieces with less value doesn't change the value of the whole when you recombine it.

If you in the US the fastest, safest, and close to cheapest way is to take cash to a Bank of America and send money to a Bitfloor account. Doing it with a bank transfer is always tedious and ends up costing you more than the difference in fees with the lost profits.

The way humans have eaten for millenia until we recently (with regards to evolution) began hunting and cooking stuff.

But it's also a problem of having terrible mods. I remember when BTC broke $50 a few months ago and there were dozens of posts about it just saying stupid things like "We finally did it" and " BTC BROKE 50!" and the mods didn't do jack shit about all the spam.
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:19:31
That's not really an option for me. Can I just use the method that I would otherwise use to purchase BTC, by taking money to a Walmart,  but opt to keep it in fiat?

I haven't tried Coinbase, that's just the general consensus of them around here right now. I have had success with Bitfloor, I just deposited $500 on Saturday and it showed up after about half an hour in my account. From there you can then buy Bitcoins in their trade section which is easy and it verifies after a few minutes.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:12:34
Holy shit, that's one of the biggest tips in I've ever seen.

No. Surely nothing. Also, The huge China rush has caused the price to, imo, permanently spike. I think this is a slight bubble, and obviously the exponential growth is unsustainable, but I doubt it will ever drop below $300 again.

@_date: 2013-03-21 02:35:42
No, i mean since there is no electricity and thus no internet, it's impossible to access the blockchain and check the amount of  Bitcoins associated with a public key.

So the address is made from your public and private keys but from that you can't determine the private only the public? Because you give out the address as a method for others to send you coins, so each address has coins and the private key allows those to be sent?
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:27:39
I do hope everything works out for you.
@_date: 2013-03-13 15:13:09
I remember something about there being a theoretically infinite number of addresses for every wallet. How is that, you can make multiple public keys and just have one private?

@_date: 2013-03-22 11:46:09
First, without the internet the US dollar is worth next to nothing. Upwards of 98% of money is completely virtual, created by banks. If the internet goes, all that money is untouchable, there's only enough physical dollars to go so far.
Second, being first is a big part of why Bitcoin is so much more valuable than say, Litecoin. Because it's first, it is bigger and more popular, thus, when stores decide to start accepting completely virtual, decentralized, and unregulated currencies, they will go for Bitcoin. Because this happens, Bitcoin will grow where other cryptocurrencies will not. Bitcoin will become the de facto cryptocurrency excepting that nothing comes to challenge it which is so much better as to warrant a paradigm shit. Once this happens, it will be as strong as well established fiats are today.
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:30:03

Because not everyone who follows him is a noob. Fontas has reach, he pretty much controls when the pumps and the dumps happen. The smart people follow him, buy in right when he announces a pump, and then sell when he is still pushing the pump. If fontas gets 200% return, they'll take 100%. They don't get super greedy and hold forever only to watch it all crash when the dump is announced since by then it's too late.
Be smart and you can make good money following fontas. You'd be an asshole, but you'd be a well off asshole.

Oh, I must have misunderstood something about reusing an address.
@_date: 2013-07-17 21:51:06
I meant more length than complexity, bad word choice there. Simply that as the entropy of the pattern increases the probability of finding it each time decreases so it would take longer to find an address with the pattern in it. Like if I was just looking for a key with the letter 'a' in it, there's a good chance I'll get it in the first few tries, but if I wanted 'thisIsALongPattern' it's much less likely to show up, and would take a very long time.

The algorithm comes straight from the source code, so check that out. But yeah, the algorithm is dead simple and the graph is boring.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:03:36
Exactly, if you buy in bulk you'll get either a better or a worse price, if you get a better price then you're better off, but equally likely is getting a worse average price and then you're worse off so the probabilities(in theory) offset each other because it's completely unpredictable. Of course with something like Bitcoins most people think they'll just go up for quite a while, in which case it'd be better to buy in bulk now. If you think the price will drop, you should buy later. If you're completely unsure cost averaging can get you somewhere in the middle but it'll be worse than the best and better than the worst.
@_date: 2013-03-18 07:18:26

This is what pisses me off most. I get the whole "You can be whatever you want!" thing, but in reality, you can't. At least not successfully. I feel for them too, it's the way we approach education that causes this. All degrees aren't equal and logically the size of the loan should be proportional to your expected earnings.
I would have been fine taking out 100K in loans for a BS in comp sci/physics and MS in comp engineering. An art major? Not so much. I think there needs to be a good amount more education related to finance in general but especially for people like this who are getting taken advantage of.

Say there are a bunch of people offering a tax that's basically zero, if he mines that then he has the probability of finding a block (his hashes per second divided by total has power of network per second) times the value of the block. If he waits and now a bunch more transactions come in that offer a tax of say 100 Bitcoins each (unrealistic I know, bear with me) and he can process a block of just these then he makes the number of transactions in the block times 100 Bitcoins so it's far more profitable to wait.
The problem with OP's question is that it assumes that this is possible or predictable, the way a miner would look at is with the average of all transactions using a heuristic. If he can mine a block with an average tax higher than the average of previous blocks then he should mine that one immediately. If it's lower, then he could make more Bitcoins by waiting in the hopes that it would approach the average and he would make more. This decision would be based on how far it is from the average (difference in value of the average tax), how far it is from the average (difference in terms of standard deviation from the average tax), and the value he would get by mining the block (his hash/s percentage times the payout). It basically depends on the rate at which the average tax of the block approaches the average tax for *all* blocks and comparing whether the profit times the estimated wait time is greater than how much he would lose by not mining.

The thing is, it worked for everybody. He said he was going to buy, so a lot of people bought, this raised the price. He then sold at a higher price, but this didn't cause the price to drop so the people who bought and "helped" him sell higher actually made decent profit too.

It is, but all currencies act as investments too. Think Nicaragua. They had inflation that meant their currency dropped in value with respect to other currencies. It was caused by increasing the supply but the same could be caused by decreasing the demand. If people feel that Bitcoin is overvalued they could stop investing which would cause the price to drop.

What? I wasn't trying to misinterpret you but now I realize I kind of did, I didn't mean to imply you were dumb enough to believe dollar cost averaging was a saving grace, it's just something that I see way to much on here. It is always better (in an objective, probabilistic, financial evaluation) to either buy nothing, or use all your willing to invest to buy now. It's probabilistically equivalent to the true-false puzzle. 
On a test there is a true/false question repeated twice, is it better to give the same answer twice or two different answers? The solution is it is equivalent to give either the same or different answers if you have no clue what the answer is (same: 50% chance of 2 points, different: 100% chance of 1 point, ie: they're both worth one point) if, however, you have the slightest leaning one way or the other, you're better off putting the same answer. Say you're 51% sure it's true, if you put both true, you have a 51% chance of getting 2 points but it's still only 100% chance of 1 point if you put different answers.
On Bitcoins, if you have the slightest idea whether they will go up or down, then you should put all or nothing in respectively for the best payout *probabilistically* (ie: a greater than 50% chance of what you expect to happen, happening is better if you go all in or out).
I just realized I come of rather condescending here: I don't mean to do that. I realize that people dollar cost average because they prefer a 70% chance at 50 rather than a 40% chance at 100 for example. It just gets to me when people say that dollar cost averaging is the way to go, because it's safer, which I realize you didn't do, it just set me off, sorry. It is safer but at the cost of profits, so it should be something that is thoroughly thought out by people looking to invest, I just never see the negatives laid out for people, only the positives.
