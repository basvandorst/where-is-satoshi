Are you having tech problems or are you just backlogged? 
@_date: 2013-06-12 19:57:28
Unless they don't know what the problem is, which is likely the case. I feel that they would be more specific if they actually know what happened.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:32:42
I was thinking the same thing. No one has had their issue resolved.

Both functions screwed up this time. People transferring to mtgox also got owned.
What pisses me off is that they took down their Support Board because massive amounts of people were posting about their problems and they didn't want future buyers to know there was a problem.

I've been waiting 7 hours.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:49:53
You are exactly right. I don't believe they know what the problem is. 
No one has had their issue fixed. They are stalling.
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:45:33
This is so true. I never had a problem until yesterday.

How quick is btcQuick? I made an account and checking everything out. It works a little differently. 
Anybody use it?
@_date: 2013-06-12 19:58:42
Both functions have been affected.
@_date: 2013-06-12 20:39:39
Thank you for this response!
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:29:31
What time did you do your transaction?
@_date: 2013-06-12 22:58:01
I believe the issue will be resolved faster if its plastered all over The more other people know about it, the better.

If I wanted to put my frustration into words, it would be this post. Everything I want to say about Bitinstant.
This is their weakness. They would have many more customers if they just solved their communications. They get so much bad press because they are horrible at communicating. 
They just need to let the customer know what's going on.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:53:00
bad job and bad luck is what is happening right now.
@_date: 2013-06-12 19:56:25
I honestly don't think this guy knows whats going on.
@_date: 2013-06-12 20:25:22
Are you serious? If he really is the owner, he needs to get his customer service together. He makes people more worried with his replies.
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:44:36
When you are running a FREE service you do beta test. This is a PAY service, I dont want to beta test anything that I am paying for.
When REAL money is involved, you test the tech yourself. You don't put out a rushed version of a website and let the customers figure out the kinks.
Bad business bitinstant.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:52:33
I'm never using Bitinstant again.
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:53:50
Yeah... I know many people who would come to reddit the very moment their bitcoins come through
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:01:33
Did you do 'direct to wallet' or 'transfer to mtgox'?
Bitinstant is having problems right now and I want to use the method that has worked for you.
@_date: 2013-06-12 20:04:50
Can you give us a time table? I would feel so much more comfortable if an ETA was applied.
@_date: 2013-06-12 07:30:16
What time did you place your order?
