Interesting site. ( ) Thanks.
I do find the indicators on bitcoinwisdom (eg MACD especially) to be useful however.

how many btc are you looking to cash out? 
these guys meet this coming thursday  but I don't believe you have the luxury of waiting.
 probably is the best option. it's a thinly-traded exchange and definitely not as responsive as the action indicated on  but  might help you determine an appropriate price. 
if these don't solve your problem, then pm me offline; I might have some additional recommendations or solutions.

Okay, I have to confess that signing up (including uploading relevant docs for KYC) was faster than any of the other sites I've registered with (only a few). However, I don't think I'm fully approved to trade; I could only upload one document to verify my ID &amp; address so only provided the original in a foreign language but not the official translation in English. Is someone going to get back to me on this? Or, can you get your guys to add a multi-document option?

I simply used Google, the title, and a few other terms like PDF and the URL/domain name that was provided.
