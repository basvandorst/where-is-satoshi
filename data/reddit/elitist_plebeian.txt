If anything I have less money after Christmas
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:43:14
And what are they going to stop spending money on to free up that revenue?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:13:13
Because past performance doesn't guarantee future results

You can't time the market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:36:30
It turns out time only moves in one direction. What an irony!

If anyone could predict what you're predicting, the price would already be $19,000. It could go up and it could also go down and nobody will know until after it happens.

The money has to come from somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:37
It was gambling before too

If it wasn't a bubble, the panic selling would be bought up without the bottom dropping out. The selling causes the crash but the bubble's already there.

How much was your downpayment and how much did you pay in interest? If you only had half the equity, most of that 70k is your own money, not a return.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:03:30
Thanks, I'm clearly not up on the lingo
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:08:58
They couldn't get paid as much somewhere else.

You're a little late for the 15k posts about how all the other dips were 25% too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:05
Haha I've heard that before
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:43
Why would you lose it all when you can sell and get back in at the bottom?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:11
Turns out you can't predict the future
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:20:29
There were a lot of people posting yesterday about how the dip wasn't so bad because it was comparable to other 25% dips. Now it's not so bad because it's comparable to other 50% dips.
Tomorrow it won't be so bad because it's comparable to other 70-90% dips?

If anyone could tell you that was going to happen for sure, the price would already be 30k.
It could go to 100k or it could go to $100. Nobody can predict the future. There are no guaranteed returns. If you don't acknowledge the possibility that you could lose everything, you won't make smart choices.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:14
I only had a quarter of a coin and I've already saved over $600 by selling when I did

This sub managed to turn the sunk cost fallacy into a meme.

I'm here for the daily assurance of resistance at ~~$17000~~ ~~$14500~~ $10,000 and how it won't go any lower than that
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:59
That concern over who's going to buy it at a super high price is how bubbles burst.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:45:47
Something as volatile as BTC isn't a great store of anything. It's primary use is as a speculative vehicle, which is fine, but let's be honest with ourselves. It's not a safe place to put money like a federally insured bank account is.

Keep in mind that a bear trap can look exactly like a bull trap before you see what happens next.

You have to trust the institution that gives your money value, whether it's social or governmental.

I'm not sure you know what you're talking about, because a dead cat bounce is an increase, not a decrease. It's called dead cat because it's going to keep decreasing and the bounce is a slight increase that makes you think it's not. A dead cat bounce is hardly something that would make you relax.

If I've learned anything from Donald Trump, that means he's going to buy himself something nice.
