And that’s the reason bitcoin won’t ever get as big as everyone wants it to: you guys are only buying to hopefully get rich in fiat currency, when the whole idea behind bitcoin is to have a currency that competes and becomes a viable alternative to fiat.

Nobody is saying you can't do what you want with your money

You do your research before asking where to buy?

Thank you for jumping in on this! This is a huge problem I see people have with Bitcoin and other crypto currencies (including a family member of mine) They see the high value of say Bitcoin and think "oh I can easily get rich off that" and they'll throw their money at it. Well stop people. Do your damn research.

Why wouldn’t he ONLY accept Bitcoin? If he truly believes in it and wants to see bitcoin become a legitimate currency and NOT a tradable commodity like 99% the community uses it, he should be accepting crypto only. But now people are getting into bitcoin because they want to get rich in fiat. And that’s why this whole thing is never going to work

1 not everyone in this sub is active. A lot of people are going to need to donate a lot more than a dollar 
2 not all 111 million people watch the commercials. Pretty much all of us reach for our phones during a commercial break

Just because it’s over 9000 doesn’t mean it’s not a scam ;)
