Thanks, I hadn't heard about exchanges that would offer to split coins. Definitely something I'll read up on!

I'm not looking to make it profitabel, but I wouldn't mind spending $30 on a USB miner to get the hang of the tech? Or am I missing something?

Thank you, I'll make sure to keep an eye out for a soft/hard fork so that I don't do anything in that timeframe!

Are there any better alternatives currently available? This might be a fun way to get into mining.

This is what I do at the moment, but in my setup this doesn't tell me if I made a good choice by trading in BTC for altcoin A. If altcoin A goes +20% in a month whilst BTC goes +30%, you're current portfolio's value would still be in the green, but not 'as green' as it could have been.
Any idea how to address this?

This seems pretty solid, thanks!

If you're HODL'ing, I don't see this as so important. Or is it still relevant?

Thank you! Does the speed of confirmation influence the value of the finale transaction? E.g. If I initiate an exchange between BTC &amp; € today at 8AM, but the fee selected makes me wait until tomorrow 8AM for it to confirm. Do I sell at today's value or at tomorrow's value?

Would a raspberry pi be as secure? I have one lying around which I could reset for it. But I would have to look into setting it up for different altcoins. Thanks for the tip!

Not yet! I looked it up now and will try it out, thanks!
