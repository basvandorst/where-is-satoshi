I assumed that. But if it’s gonna be the actual symbol used worldwide it is the same as a negative Symbol

Kinda looks like the SS bolts so maybe not?

You have to remember exchanges like bitmex work on contacts not bitcoin. If people are buying ‘more’ contracts then the value on bitmex will be higher than the asset. Works the other way. But what you’ll tend to see is bitmex will hover about 10-20 above one week and then down the next. This is what generates the funding rate at these exchanges.

Security and liquidation really. Everything else is a bonus would like, rather than need

You can make that assumption yes, but you have to bare in mind that if you believe that bitcoin is manipulated at all. All of that will take place on leveraged exchanges. But yes to answer the question, if the price is below the real asset price it might indicate some big players are building short positions

The comment had more ups and downs than the market

Hmm fuck.. online gambling in general could really benefit from this. Although blockchain technology would need a bit more progress first. If coins with huge market caps are being double spent now, undoubtably a small gambling app could be broken with relative ease

It’s more so for the higher percentages. When bitcoin moves up 10% some alts can move 20-30. A lot more profit to be had. Obviously the risk is when it all drops like now, the alts tend to drop harder

That isn’t the graph for 2018 though.. you’ve just copied and pasted 2014 over it lol

Yeah your right that’s why I’ve made so much money from swing trading the charts. I’m so dumb
