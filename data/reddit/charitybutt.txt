Entities that provide the insurance on those accounts don't charge enough and don't have the reserves they should to cover everyone in the case of real crises. Most were tapped very quickly last time around. Also, money market accounts were frozen and will be frozen in the next crash, some indefinitely until volatility lets up.

The majority of people who were already living in poverty already have the leadership they wanted. The middle and upper classes are the ones who really want a pro-western government that is willing to sell off the nation's resources to multinationals.
Armed revolution isn't the solution now and is rarely the solution, rule by force and things like military juntas aren't pleasant. More bloodshed rarely solves anything and you're back to square one when people demand democratic elections in the future.
Things aren't as simple as they appear. Were they and are they being harsh on political dissidents? Probably. But who is backing them in the first place? Is it really paranoia if there is actually a large cartel of multinationals and governments gunning for the resources you have as a nation?
It's not like rebel groups backed by the west are assured to be any less corrupt than those currently in power. Look to any other countries the west has meddled in to get a glimpse into how they've been doing. Hell, look at Syria or Yemen to see what happens when you throw arms into the mix. Human life is precious. They need to be armed with knowledge and the ability to force transparency and fairness on their governments, not weapons.
