Better late than never man. All your attitude here does is tell people they should never accept bitcoins because you'll still not give them any because they "didn't do it fast enough".

I'd be impressed as hell if anyone actually memorized that.

Of course not. I own bitcoins and I'm nowhere near rich.

You're wrong. These bitcoins are 100% guaranteed to be stolen. He's getting to them first and keeping them safe for the owner. He's literally saving the money.

Yep, this was me at the start. Now I just buy a little bit every month and never sell. Not gonna let it happen to me again.

Like I said: You'd have to pay capital gains tax.
EDIT: Although I see how the wording I used could be confusing. I'll edit my post.

How would you not? As soon as you do *anything* with your bitcoins it is a taxable event. That includes selling them *or* using them to buy something (like a house).

Indeed. That's why diceware is so important to use for choosing your random words in a brain wallet.

Yeah exactly like Obamacare. Feel a little silly not seeing that myself.

I was only discussing the support part of the contract. Everything else is outside the scope of my shits to give.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:01:50
That makes a lot of sense and is really obvious in retrospect. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:29:23
What is up with the section about the support cost? Why do you charge for the time that people weren't covered by support if they later elect to get support? Or is this something that OP and I are misunderstanding?
And if that too is "standard contract stuff" then I want to know the logic behind it even more.

Four lines of a poem in Afrikaans is a terrible brain wallet password. 12 random words generated with Diceware is astronomically more safe. Like, we're talking the difference between a human trying to guess "password1" and "k2j5kl;jafdjsd$ 1@

You're doing Satoshi's work my friend. The Bitcoin community could really use more new user guides and FAQs.

You mentioned you're not very password clever. For a really secure brainwallet you'd have to use 12 completely randomly generated words as the password at minimum. So if you don't think you could handle that, don't use one.
BTW, randomly generated means use diceware. Don't do it on a computer or just randomly flip through pages of a dictionary.
