Yeah, it's called "trading". Novel concept, but it goes like this: sell at $240, buy at $225, sell at $260, buy at $240...etc. Can't get funds out, what am I supposed to do, cry?
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:32:19
I don't claim to know everything about transactions, blockchain, etc., so please excuse me if I am being thick, but, if these are stolen Gox coins, wouldn't the *days destroyed* have been reset when they were hacked/withdrawn from Gox (presumably earlier this year) rather than now, for apparent laundering?

He says he's the lead plaintiff (contracted the firm directly), I would assume, if you emailed the lawyer address on the website with your details, someone will get back to you during business hours on Monday. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:32:59
As part of the civil rehabilitation, can't Karpeles just say, "Look, Mt. Gox has 2000 BTC left*, so here's .09% of the bitcoins that were owed to you, it's the best we can do", freeing himself and his company from liability in class action suits like this one? 
*(I wouldn't be surprised if all this recent blockchain-splitting activity was Karpeles trying to spread his own BTC around so they can't be accounted for as viable assets)
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:43:50
Sorry. Another question: are the legal fees split between the plaintiffs or are they applied in full to each? 
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:41:20
Astonishing the top-voted comments here are "blame Canada" and "OMG what bad news", yet all the comments pointing out this story is based purely on SPECULATION are buried. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:34:42
I think they're trying to say the Mt. Gox/bitcoinity price you're seeing is out of date. Most — if not all — other exchanges have already rebounded. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 14:12:25
You may be right. We'll never know. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:34:41
It's hilarious that every comment I've seen like this today is from a brand new throwaway account.

I think life on Earth would become pretty much unbearable if pigs could fly. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:27:21
You're right. I can think of at least two previous instances of this, although they didn't have the cool ASCII skull this one has (which I am stealing for my e-mail sig). 
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:54:02
Yeah, uh, your top menu, where it should say "Account" actually says "Ac*cunt*". Ooooops.

Cavirtex. Sign up at their website, follow instructions on how to do a bank-to-bank deposit (no verification required), go to your bank, make the transfer as directed and you will have the money in your cavirtex account the same day (was less than an hour when I did it, but with all the activity today, I'd cut them some slack). 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:56:06
No, downvoted because another pointless post about a price fluctuation. *We know, we know*. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:13:43
I think the bulk of "panic sellers" are gone at this point. During the big crash, the price seemed to really have a hard time recovering, indicating panicked n00bs sold and stayed out (there were a few "I've lost all my money" posts at the time). 
Considering the price jumped right back up to exactly where it was before the attack (in a matter of minutes!) I think it was mainly 24-hour day-traders selling high and buying not-quite-so-high. Those who missed-out on the low (buying on the way back up) just weren't quick enough. 
DDoSers are getting desperate now (dumb attacks on peripheral bitcoin-related sites at the moment) since their return is increasingly minimal. Hopefully we will soon see an end to this nonsense. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:04:40
Cavirtex (no lag) is already rebounding fast. In the wise words of Douglas Adams, "Don't Panic". 
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:29:34
Blind shot in the dark: because money is *earned* not just handed-out? That's the way we do it where I'm from anyway.

Thanks for bitcoinstarter. First I've heard of it, will check it out. I've tried kickstarter and indiegogo in the past and have realized I absolutely hate begging and pleading for money ("We're almost there folks!" "Just a little further!" *blech*) . That's just not who I am. Maybe I need to hire someone to beg and plead for me. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:19:19
Believe me, Gox is not blame-free, but I find it utterly irresponsible to share an exploit publicly that inhibits trading. 
White Hat response: notify Mt. Gox. If they do nothing to fix the exploit after a reasonable amount of time, go public in a non-damaging way. *"Hey, dudes, look what you can do, LOLZ!!"* is making a shitty situation even worse. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:30:28
It's genius, really: anyone who reads this and believes it is going to dump their BTC before the alleged event. No need to DDoS at all!
@_date: 2013-04-06 12:47:14
I second the abortion confusion. That's the first thing I thought of when I saw it. Secondly, I don't really understand what charity or organization you are attempting to fund here. Is it just about raising money for you?
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:23:59
Congrats! You lost me on your question, though. I am by no means an expert, but I immediately got my BTC out of the exchange and into a separate wallet (offline). I wouldn't recommend keeping it in cavirtex (if that's what your wallet is reading) in the slim chance they get hacked or something, unless you are planning on day trading. 
TL;DR: if you transfer your BTC from the exchange into a "safe" wallet, there should be 0 BTC left in your cavirtex balance. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:38:16
No offence taken. I am asking for honest responses. 
To amplify: I have been in the industry for 20+ years (i.e., I'm not a kid living in his parents' basement) and know all too well that most independent films suck (I have been involved with many, budgets ranging from $200K to $13mil ... all wasted money). 
I didn't want this to be a place where I need to defend my talent (once again, looking for honesty), but it's not simply a case of: my projects are shit otherwise they would have been made; getting decent $$ together for an independent film is increasingly hard. Everyone wants what the big opening weekend has (that's all it's about these days) and rarely do smaller films even open on more than one or two screens (if at all). It seems like everyone I have ever been involved with, gearing up for projects, is like this, and changes, week-to-week. New exorcism movie opens big? Need to put an exorcism in the movie. New comedy opens big? Gotta put in more jokes. *Wishy-washiness* is the reason I have walked away from potential investors in the past, because I have been involved (not as key creative) on these other projects where I have seen how much damage that causes when the filmmaker concedes. 
[end mini-rant]
Thanks for your response just the same!
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:26:10
You are undoubtably right, but let's see the proof: notably the photo of their offices with a logo Photoshopped in. I, for one, love seeing shit like that.

FTFY: "AP's *Twitter account* was hacked". 
True, it did cause a market dip though. Our "traders" realize a Twitter hack ain't that big of a deal. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:27:45
I agree. My thumb is sore (Alien Blue) from endlessly downvoting childish image macros, random numbers ($200!!!! $500!!!! $1000!!!!) and "OMG I'm gonna be so rich!" posts. used to have good commentary, but now it's next to impossible to find through the chatter.

I agree totally with you about supporting open source and new ideas. That's the problem I've found with crowdsourcing something that isn't necessarily "ground breaking"; I personally would not put up cash for "just another horror film" for example. 
To be perfectly clear: *I am in no way attempting to solicit money from or anyone else*. My question was in response to the posts I have seen in the last couple of weeks (here and elsewhere) where people were doing this and was curious what the response of the community was. 
At 46, and two decades in the industry, I am past the point of hopefully looking for like-minded investors and would rather cross my fingers against my bitcoin investment and fund my projects out of my own pocket (with blackjack and hookers!)
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:05:02
Added to which, the plan allows 15 minutes between the "press release" and the DDoS, as if Wolf Blitzer's gonna go, "We have to leave our Boston Bomber coverage for this *breaking* story about bitcoin..."

Holy shit. The first intelligent bitcoin article I've read all day (maybe week)!

You realize, of course, if they take customers' money and don't deliver product, they go to jail, right? On a scale like this, using real names and actual companies, it doesn't sound like a well-thought-out scam to me.

@_date: 2013-11-07 13:39:59
I'm in the same boat. I saw the Bitstamp surge last night as an excellent opportunity to finally leave Gox. Apparently their response was, *not so fast*.
Just for the record: sent to private wallet (not an exchange address), all the fees boxes ticked...ten hours and counting, still not in the blockchain. 
I hope I'm wrong, but this feels like the first sign of a major problem at Gox, i.e., they are not processing withdrawals because *they can't*.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:10:06
You raise an excellent point. Unfortunately, your post is going to probably go unread/downvoted to Hell because of your inflammatory title. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:14:41

@_date: 2013-04-08 23:32:03
Exchange rate, fees and price fluctuation maybe? You can see more detail on the Transactions tab on cavirtex, if the numbers still don't add up, I'd contact support. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:39:35
I think the fact that chart sites are being targeted after their less than successful DDoS of Mt. Gox reveals the age and mentality of the perps. It's interesting to ponder that the attacks are by a group of nefarious financial geniuses, but since this second attack today smacks of *retaliation*, it's probably most likely a bunch of dumb kids with just enough financial smarts to know what steps to take to make some illicit cash (and get pissed-off when they don't). 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:31:57
Relax. I have a gut feeling the last couple of days were like when you were in school: two or three kids causing problems at the back of the class and when the teacher asks them to leave, they knock over chairs and books on the way out. I think things will be much more stable from this point forward (fingers crossed).

In Canada, Cavirtex.com. Their rates are high-ish, but you can transfer money from your bank (in person) without verification and buy bitcoins by the time you get home. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:58:56
I'm too lazy to look into this in detail, but, a sudden rise above 140, followed by a big drop (like you said, small transactions) certainly seems fishy to me; like some "group" got together to buy, then dump en masse in an attempt to crash the market. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:35:23
That doesn't sound right to me. Like I said, when I did it, the cash was ready when I got home (less than an hour) and that only a week or so ago. Maybe they're talking about online transfers rather than in-person bank-to-bank deposits. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:09:49
I recommend melatonin as well. It rocks! If you still can't sleep, try Resurrect-PM from GNC (also all-natural). I have chronic insomnia (pre-bitcoin) and it knocks me right out.

My thoughts exactly. Upboats to you. ;)
However, even having the digital equipment (I have cheap, committed access to a Red Epic, for example, and have been editing myself for many years), actors will not work for free (if they are in a union, they can't), plus locations, transportation, etc. etc. and once you start getting investors for these additional costs, you start getting pressure for: "We really need a star in this, so it *opens big*!"  or "It doesn't have a twist ending! It needs a twist ending!" Movies make even the most level-headed people greedy and delusional like this. 
I am currently converting all my old screenplays into novels and self-publishing with moderate success. This seems to be the best plan I have come up with yet.

@_date: 2013-11-07 15:54:28
