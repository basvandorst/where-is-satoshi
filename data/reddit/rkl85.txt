I will contact the support. But you wrote: "... your tx has enough priority to get confirmed for free...". Does this mean if my transaction have not enougth priority it will never confirmed? How is the priority calculated?
@_date: 2014-12-01 18:47:18
After nearly eight hours I've got the first three confirmations, unbelievable :D
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:12:43
I thought this could be the problem, but 3h are huge. This is a transaction from bitcoin.de, they paid no fees ;).
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:03:27
Still no confirmation. Incredible..

So it seems there are important backgrounds to know about level DB. I just wanna access the UTXO database from an own tool, just reading. I have seen that there is another levelDB library inside the Bitcoin Core code. It looks more complex than this one from the Ubuntu package. Maybe I should try this.
@_date: 2016-05-26 17:29:21
Good hint, thank you. So maybe a read only bind mount should be on a production system a safe way.
@_date: 2016-05-26 15:08:37
Ah damn, I read about this in past. Very interesting, thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-26 17:19:16
This node have no relevant keys, but how can I corrupt my keys by just working with the UTXO database?
@_date: 2016-05-26 14:56:19
Thank you nullc,
this explains all. But as I mentioned, I have seen that you guys provide an own leveldb lib with Bitcoin Core under src/leveldb. There are also working test tools to dumb single chainstate files. Can I access the database with your lib?
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-26 15:42:57
Yes, I know, damn :D
@_date: 2016-05-26 15:24:52
OK, I will review the core implementation for decrypting. Thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-26 14:42:07
It is interesting that the dataset is encrypted, why? And no, I did nothing with the original database. I have only checked if my implementation can open it, just the simple DB::Open from libleveldb, nothing more at this point. After this, bitcoind said it is corrupted.
I also closed bitcoind before accessing the database, if bitcoind is running I get the expected error that the database is locked.
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:09:54
Are there legitimate reasons why the core devs don't implement deterministic keys?
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:55:24
Maybe this one?
It's sold by a german company.

Avoid apple!
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:41:22
What the hell satoshies are?
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:11:08
Bitcoin already triumphs.
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:10:19
I love it :).
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:19:35
Thank you guys, realy interesting!

Chinas goverment lives in fear because oft bitcoin and other crypto currencies. It's not a surprise that they try to ban it completely. But in the end, or better future, bitcoin wins. And guys like us, not selling, too.

Apple banned a lot, there are enougth storries in many blogs. An example is here 
A past years ago I had an iPhone, but I'm happy that I changed my mind. Even Microsoft has a better philosophy. And I realy realy dislike microsoft.
Nevertheless, in my eyes Steve Jobs was one of the greatest businessman I know and I've a lot of respect for his work, what he had reached. However, the apple products are for my purposes useless. Why should I pay for a device so much money and need to jailbreak it to use it like I want?
Maybe you're working for apple?
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:03:48
Ok, but what is it elemantary? Never heard it before. Is it a kind of cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:18:51
I recommend 
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:31:48
A bit bubble, a bit beauty, simple both.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:41:16
If all think so, the network will die.
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:56:19
Great. I'm satisfied.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:42:42
No. I mean no. The curve nakamoto used to design bitcoin is a special one.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:47:06
Why selling?
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:41:20
"Nakamoto" used a special elliptic curve which is no default. I think he or she knows what he or she did.
