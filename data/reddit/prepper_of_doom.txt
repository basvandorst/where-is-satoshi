yup so true.  It's just uh.. in the mean time I'm gonna use Eth and LTC to you know, move things around cuz uh.. I mean.. getting bitcoin on and off exchanges kinda um.. you know..
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:32:49
I have to hodl since the fees are more than 20% of the BTC I own.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:10:50
Thanks for the tip.  I'm not a trader and would rather just stick with BTC.  Is there another wallet for BTC that charges lower fees?  Maybe I'm using the wrong one.  It's almost as expensive as western union!
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:39:58
Seems to me the Dev team hasn't done shit.  slow and expensive transactions.  At least you can pretend it's a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:22:57
lol.  "Hey guys!   Look here!  someone on still believes in the system!"

too bad the blocks can't be bigger.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:33
I want to close my coinbase account and try different exchanges.  I'm new and not a big player in the market but I have about $180 worth of Bitcoin.  For some reason the fee seems really high.  Is this normal?  Do all wallets charge this high fee?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:52:53
meh, I was just giving cockstream supporters a hard time.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:36:33
Very true.  I was all for Bitcoin.  Then I learned about blockstream, small blocks,and how useless lightning network is.  But such is life.  ALL in on TRON.  Get rich or die trying right?
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:16:56
Just bought my first bitcoin.  I am already preparing for a 50% drop.  Your welcome!
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:20:03
Will a Bitcoin ETF have similar controversies of the Gold ETF?  i.e paper gold vs real gold, manipulation of the markets, etc?
@_date: 2017-02-02 15:54:33
Don't know if this is [any better](
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:05:19
Just bought at the ATH.  Ready for it to drop, as per tradition.
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:53:15
i wonder if it's due to the Chinese finally having access to their bitcoins on exchanges after being locked up for a month.  I sure as hell would nope the hell outta there.  Woudln't risk the gubermint doing that again, and for longer term.
@_date: 2017-02-25 04:49:10
With the bitcoin ETF possibly coming out, is it possible the ETF will have the same effect the gold ETF did?  Essentially that there is more paper gold than real mined gold?  i.e, more "paper bitcoin" being traded than actually mined bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:00:31
This is my worry and I've asked that a few times here on but haven't had a response into how that can be prevented.  I don't understand blockchains and segwidgets and all that.  I'm a goldbug for the most part but understand the fundamentals of bitcoin as being similar.
  
  
How can bitcoin protect itself against the "paper version of bitcoin?"
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:41:40
Any guides for Canadians?  Feel like an Ass sitting on all my gold and silver.  I remember hearing about bitcoin in 2011
  
@_date: 2017-01-23 21:38:59
Would anyone else be excited about a gold linked bitcoin currency?  
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:11:27
What is the current market cap for bitcoin?  I'm wondering what the market cap would/should be for something that people will eventually use all over the world.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:33:25
I wonder what the transaction cost is.  Less then btc probably.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:37:37
That's why all the money I took out from a loan is going into DOGE.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:18:28
Lol.  Hey at least you can move your BTC to your hardware wallet cheaply and quickly right?  Just use the lightning rod, or something.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:23:13
Well at least the person sending the btc won't know for hours, or even days... cuz you know.. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:19:40
Bitfinex.. awesome.
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:16:07
Ya, just leave your bitcoins and USDT on bitfinex.  Totally safe there.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:28:16
thanks Bitfinex!
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:14:25
That looks forking good!
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:43:38
whatever you say.  Personally I'm staying away from the expensive and slow transactions of BTC.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:01:41
lol, this is some nice propaganda.  Best of luck to you all.  I'm invested in Blockchain, but not btc for a reason.  Can't stand the blockstream cocksuckers as much as I can't stand the mining whores of bitmain.  
  
You guys are like the last page of Animal farm.

@_date: 2017-07-22 04:30:45
Personally I think if people would accept the centralized control of core and blockstream, Bitcoin would have been leap years ahead already.  Still a long road, but it's looking good!
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:49:58
I'm in favor of cryptocurrencies.  I'm not some mouth piece for one individual coin.  I think each can fill a niche and has potential to grow.  I also recognize that each coin can have faults as well.  To say bitcoin is some perfect holy crypto coin is nonsense.  To insinuate I have to be on "team bitcoin" just shows how ridiculous this BU vs core drama is.  It's too bad and have essentially become censored propaganda.  
  
For what it's worth I hold BTC, Eth, Factom, and a few others.  The cryptosphere has alot of room to grow.  Don't limit yourself to just one diety.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:57:28
Woot love watching my bitcoin go up!  HODL!  
  
It's great that Bitcoin was able to follow Ethereums lead.  Get people together in a centralized location, discuss ideas, and come up with an agreement!  BIP91 baby!
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:03:56
long transaction times and high fees is also another difference.......
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:26:07
WAKE UP, BOYCOTT CORE AND BLOCKSTREAM!!!  
  
Oh wait.. which subreddit is this again?  The Democrats or Republicans?

I have some bitcoin, but it's not a huge percentage of my crypto investments.  I'm just wondering why y'all are scared of a fork?  
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:19:30
I enjoy their cartoons.  But this is even cringe worthy for me, and I'm a crass motherfucker.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:59:34
shhh.. you're on Maximilist territory.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:53:12
Careful.  You're gonna have core dev dick sucking supporters get you banned.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:38:39
Congrats Bitcoin!  
  
Personally don't own any myself, since I've been a gold/silver stacker for the last 4-5 years, but I applaud the use of competing currencies.  I turned down the idea when I first heard bout it, then trading at around $4 (I'm a bit of an oldie, and just quite couldn't grasp the idea of "data mining"). yikes, looks like I could have made some good dough!
  
Anyways, hoping you will get some good media coverage on this, and that the media will pick up on the idea of competing currencies.  Then maybe those of us stacking gold, and especially silver can get in on some of the action! :P  
  
cheers,
