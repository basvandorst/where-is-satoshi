we dont "need" bitcoins price to be at 10k right now, if stability over time is going to be the real goal, in addition to gains obv. 
I'd be cool with the 7-8k range for the next year and a slow creep up to 10k level again. It is being bought at these higher levels as a speculative asset right now, it is probably "worth" around 5k as a store of value currently. 
When the 2nd layers and side chains take more of the payments, THEN we have something very useful that competes with currencies and safe haven assets.

Napster was banned and file sharing increased due to torrenting.

You really dont understand the money creation process for Fiat currencies work (or you are trolling me) 
Inflation decreases the value of currency over time. Deflation is the opposite. Bitcoin is "digital gold" 
100 years ago the same amount of gold bought a suit or a cow that it would take to buy one today. Fiat currencies have lost 95% of their value, bitcoin is designed to be like digital gold. IT IS DEFLATIONARY.

bitcoin isnt for silicon valley people with banking though. 
2 billion people are unbanked world wide
buying a phone with internet access is easy now for many of the unbanked 
Bitcoin allows anyone with internet access to have a bank account for the first time. Nobody cares if the people who have easy and cheap banking like bitcoin as a store of value and medium of exchange. 
Look at gold, most of us dont own it, it still has value to many people. You dont need everyone on board saying its the greatest thing every for it to have actual value and do what it was designed to do.

If bitcoin isnt digital gold, that's going to scale for digital money over the next ten years, then all these altcoins (that bitcoin paid for) are far worse, if not completely useless/worthless. 
we're at .05% of the world owning bitcoin, if we can finally agree which "crypto" is money, maybe THEN we can start considering which "crypto" is worth spending money on. 
Not hating on building things, just dont tell me to care or see value in XRP doing fast banking transactions, while JPM Coin launches and Facebook wants Libra to be digital money too.... fuck these people with money trying to print more for themselves.

Comments you make regarding beliefs or groups you are interested in. 
Your email content (the major "free" services are great sources of info for hackers that sell this stuff) 
Your banking info gets hacked and a group would know your location, purchases, payroll, income, assets
Storing your information in other peoples databases ensure that some $20/hr employee can sell your information to people that want this type of information.

You kids and your trendy internet money bullshit 
Bitcoin is one of a kind. If it dies, it has to be from a National currency becoming a "crypto" -- which theoretically works in NO way -- maybe a Nation tries to attack all crypto but even that doesnt look possible. So there is bitcoin or there is no crypto. 
You cant have bitcoin die or be replaced with something to create some new crypto-thing that says its money to everyone. Bitcoin hasnt even done that for 5% of the global population yet -- it is at about 0.05% of the world that owns bitcoin... you cant destroy it and convince all holders something new is better to get to 5% of the world owning a "new crypto" some day.

its a store of value that is going to be a global payment solution (in 10 years or so) with side chains and 2nd layer solutions.... adoption is at less than 0.05% (40mil) of the world by nic carters estimates -- which I trust more than all the FUDsters here
There are still some solvable problems that bitcoin will have to solve over the next few years. Adoption increases as those payment options actually become useable to common folk. 
I still like it as a global store of value and for global payments, I just dont want to be sending payments on chain 10 years from now
And no I dont want "faster/less secure" transactions with a different "crypto" ffs.
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:29:48
I would rather lend out, or borrow against my bitcoin with friends and family, than wait for payment options to use bitcoin for small payments. 
If you were to have someone willing to lend fiat that you could buy back your bitcoin from, that would be amazing incentive for loan repayment in the future. Not a bank loan, more like something you "sell" your friend who isnt sure about bitcoin but buy it back from them over time or they keep it if you dont make payments.

From a very layman/outsider perspective, it appears like the central banks are fighting over who's shit stinks the worst because someone needs to take a hit for the others currencies to stay "stable." 
I could be off but the same thing that effected housing in 08 was everything being connected in finance so much, we all took a bit of a hit kicking the can down the road. Brexit isnt helping the pound, eurozone bail outs arent popular anymore... Quantitative Easing in the US is become standard?!? It was a one time test that might be standard... nobody has that great of money when you look at what these clowns are doing to "solve" the problems when they're in power.

Its a stupid topic though when the price is so low and everyone is in acquisition mode. You should assume the value will go up, why would you spend more than 5-10% of your digital gold that has a fixed supply? You spend the fiat that is hit by inflation like everyone else before the currency dies. 
It is owned by 30-40 million people, that's .05% of the world population, there isn't very far for it to gain adoption before its considered mass adoption. It is already held by more people than many national currencies, those currencies suck like bitcoin does as a currency right now....its still super useful and better money than central banks offer.

Its mined through proof of work, that is the "innovation" Satoshi solved, you dont have double spend problem with bitcoin because of the mining process. 
The other miners verify whoever mined a new bitcoin... there is no creation process...they all want to mine it. The math was set years ago for the monetary policy to never change in bitcoin. You cant add more bitcoin or change the rate it is mined.... thats in the code from years ago. 
Central banks change the rate money is lent out whenever a new quarter falls. 
Whenever the economy has "problems" they change the money supply to suit the governments needs, not the holders of money needs. 
This is really basic stuff you're supposed to know about bitcoin :) If its any consolation, 99% of the world doesnt know this stuff yet :)

There is a 1000 year history of it being a store of value 
The fact that a bunch of coders have said money is now on the blockchain and to start valuing it is WAY over their heads. 
What do you do when you are confused or dont understand something? Start valuing it because the masses tell you, or wait to understand it and see actual data before seeing value in it?

That wasnt the innovation bitcoin has offered the world. Blockchain is a fancy word for digital ledger. Ledgers have existed for a long time. 
Proof of work vs. printed currency/gold (as a store of value) 
The ability to transfer a currency without requiring 3rd parties isn't possible without having a way to prove how the currency came into existence. 
The open source rule set to mining that currency (and setting the monetary policy in code), that all becomes much more clear after you understand mining proof of work verifies that the miner got his/her bitcoin in a fair way to everyone.

Its never been inflationary 
Inflation assumes you can create more 
Bitcoin is set in the protocol to only have 21 million over the next 140 years (or whatev) 
You cant call that inflation, that is the supply of the bitcoin overall. That never changes, only the value the outside world see bitcoin having changes.... there will NOT be more BTC  created.

lol bitcoin FUNDED the whole "crypto" space 
It isnt even a space YET. 
Just like bitcoin isnt a currency (as much as a store of value) so this idea of "rounds" is just hilarious. Bitcoin needs a lot more adoption to be considered money, yet all these altcoins want to just take peoples digital money.

You need to have a pic that tells a person why they are going to your site, a girl isnt something that the site offers. 
Take a problem that your site solves and hack a pic together in photopea. 
A meme would work better than this, why is the girl in the pic... for no other reason that a girl could possibly shop on the site or she might be a seller?!?! Why have the pic of the girl....there is no reason. 
WHAT DOES YOUR SITE DO
Make the pic tell the person why they are going to go to your site. Not this pic. 
Pretty girls are a dime a dozen online, solving a users problem is rare, so do that.

BTC is deflationary, Fiat is inflationary. The halvening means LESS bitcoin will be available as time goes on, acquiring BTC becomes harder for everyone.
USD and every other national currency is inflated through fractional reserve banking, Quantitive easing and other measures to keep the purchasing power "in line" with what the central bankers want. Nobody holding cash can control what the bankers do with the value of it.

why does anyone care if the millionaires own it? Look at Gold. Maybe the gold bugs shout that there isnt enough gold for everyone to own a kilo of Gold, I find that unlikely though.

America and China will have the biggest underground bitcoin networks in a few years because the Yuan and USD are in a currency war that won't end for years. 
The SDR basket gets renegotiated next year, that is the basket of currencies China was added to make the percentages: U.S. dollar 41.73%, Euro 30.93%, Renminbi (Chinese yuan) 10.92%, Japanese yen 8.33%, British pound 8.09%. That is the reserve currency China will want everyone to move to. 
Then you have the Euro still alive somehow after bailout loans for everyone, the Pound is screwed with Brexit being some weird smokescreen and US and China *still* want to duke it out on currency values...

No, it is mined through proof of work 
Fiat money -- Printed paper costs $0.14 to print $100 
Bitcoin 2,112 Mined in the last 24 hrs
Miners revenue was $8,453,235 for mining 2112 BTC at today's prices. That revenue was earned by doing work. Electricity costs money and requires verification of other miners to prove bitcoin was mined. 
The Fed has "checks and balances" in place to print their fiat and "control the supply" but do ALL central banks? Fuck no 
How do you assign a value to a fiat currency? Economy's change. It used to be gold backed but isnt. They have a military that can force people to value the money but only for so long.

Paying for things online is easier imo. Especially if someone is doing contract work in a different country and owed $20 - $50... its simple with bitcoin to get it in a few minutes.

Nobody can hire a developer in the space for under $1 million a year and none of the bitcoin developers seem interested in attempting to create a competitor for digital money. 
Developers in cryptography and blockchain are rare and expensive for creating secure network protocols. 
An attempt to build something would start at $50mil (possibly more) a year to get the initial start on a coin to one day replace money. 
It will cost exponentially more to create a "competitor" as time goes on AND there will always be the btc holders that wont move to a new tech. 
The only groups that could come close would be state developed cryptos and THAT wont work as global internet money for everyone.

Do you know the difference between Austrian Economics and Keynesian? You need to start there and pretend the world is able to transfer gold easier than we actually can. 
If bitcoin is digital gold, then there is no additional coin created when asset values increase or decrease over time.

@_date: 2019-03-09 06:34:04

You can have a lawyer escrow just like fiat but I dont see any benefit to selling for fiat and just swapping it for btc after the sale.

Bitcoiners would see the action on a certain exchange... there is only so much a central bank can print before people get wind of it. 
The theory more likely (imo) is that one central bank announces it and others start coming forward admitting they were buying "small" amounts as well. 
As far as a central banking printing just to buy --- WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? They have a monopoly on money in their country and "simply" need to keep the media telling people bitcoin is a fraud. That will last another two to five years before central banks are forced to peg their currency to *something*.

But US dollars were only ALLOWED initially because they were printed when the central bank held the equal amount of gold for the paper dollar. 
That just went out the window at some point as a "nice to have" but it's important to have a standard for creating more money beyond government desire. 
Look at all the missing US dollars in government agencies that are barely known about... its such a racket when you print a currency and get to say it's honest.

Just click the tab on the top right that says "buy Anonymously" or search any country that you want to buy bitcoin and it shows anonymous exchanges. 
I get your point, there is nothing a person can do (other than not use the exchange) when a government forces (or allows) a bitcoin exchange to create requirements like this...
Most people have not heard of this specific exchange for a reason, we just wait because most exchanges die off over time. They cant compete when there are hundreds of options world wide to get bitcoin.

There is no easy way to explain bitcoin to people who dont understand economics, global macro, cryptography, computer science, system security, networks, game theory, psychology, Lindy effect and governance.

@_date: 2019-03-12 19:28:34
Too many people comment when they dont understand bitcoin. 
Its deflationary currency that is made through technology. That doesnt require a central banker to set the interest rate or increase the money supply when politicians switch chairs in the government. 
You see governments always need more money to buy things and the central bank helps them buy whatever they want...not necessarily what the PEOPLE want. This devalues everyone's money in that nations currency. 
It removes politics from changing the value of money. IF you value bitcoin. 
If you don't that is fine but realize that the value of your currency is controlled by central bankers who are told by politicians to "make the numbers work" and print more fiat. 
Look at Brexit and the pound dropping 30% the day people voted for that....that isnt a currency you want the world bankers deciding has 30% less spending power over night....ridiculous. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:57:24


adoption over time. Less than 1% of the world owns it as a store of value/payment option. As that number increases to 5-10% of the population the value starts to stabilize. 
The reason we dont care about price is that it doesnt stabilize downward... 
The other Fiat questions and comparisons to current money... Bitcoin and Gold bugs believe that the FIAT money will have to be backed by SOMETHING again. It was backed up until the 70s by gold... there is only 8 trillion in gold supply on earth currently though....there is $250 trillion in global debt... it wont work at current rates. 
We cant keep printing money to solve problems without some type of "rules" to the money printing or people who hold money cant actually store value...

I really like Jim Rickards book Currency Wars, which is about holding gold instead of fiat currency. He hates bitcoin but the premise is the exact same, fiat currency is weaponized and lowering the value of a countries currency is an attempt to starve the people. Making it easier to take land and resources because the country being poorer and owing the reserve currency (USA) makes them vulnerable. 
Part of what he wrote are playing out now (more coincidence probably than actual predictions) as he wrote this after the 08 fallout.

No? is there a gap in the market not allowing gamers to spend endless hours staring at screens and wasting their time? I dont know who in the world is begging for someone to add gaming to the blockchain but its not needed as much as "sound money" 
Bitcoin is digital gold. We want that agreed upon before valuing things like ETH - that is all... 
Ethereum isnt a shit project or trying to scam people, how do we value something when its based on fiat currencies that compete with our digital gold? We can't. Its a fools errand. If others want to speculate go for it. Many of us have lost good bitcoin on things like this over the last decade.
IF THERE IS NO AGREED UPON MONEY WITHIN DIGITAL CURRENCY, WHY ARE ALL THE OTHER PROJECTS SUCKING UP BITCOIN AND PRETENDING THEY VALUE BITCOIN? THEY FUND THEIR PROJECTS WITH IT, EVERY ALTCOIN IS FUNDED BY BITCOIN SO ITS BACK TO BASICS OR NO DIGITAL MONEY FOR ANYONE.

You are disrespecting the very asset you purchase to trade --- hoping to gamble for more bitcoin... you think you are the only one with that strategy? Do you believe you have an EDGE in "crypto" to make a living at this? 
Bitcoin is the ONLY valuable thing in "crypto" that we "kind of" agree on (we really dont agree it seems -- there is no money without bitcoin though). 
Traders come in pretending they need all these shitcoins because that is where their bread and butter is. Stealing from dumb people who think an unregulated stock market is somehow a good idea for new traders.

Give me a million to 1 odds that bitcoin hits 50k by end of year I really dont care... its a stupid bet. 
Not calling you stupid, the algorithms and robot modeling these groups have to make betting lines are COMPLETELY accurate - you ARE getting the worst part of the line 98% of the time.


ATH was 20k 2 years ago... the bet is that it will double ATH and go 4X what it is TODAY and you will ONLY get 5X your bet?!?! But anything short of that you lose... its an OBVIOUS bad bet on so many levels.

Ive paid people for work with bitcoin many times. It will actually be a replacement (over time) for fiat with the second layers and side chains. The main chain wasnt really for payments though, Im willing to wait it out for solutions over the next decade.

You left out that there is $250 TRILLION in Global debt and nothing backing the fiat currencies 
The Central banks NEED to stabilize their currencies with SOMETHING. 
It might be gold, it might be a new asset class or it might be bitcoin. This 100% has to happen in the next 5 years. 
You cannot increase debt by 3X, wealth barely increases over 20 years (as Tyler points out) and have the world say "that's sound money"
Oh and OPs points above obv... those are good reasons for bitcoin too

All the empty houses the Chinese bought in the US, Canada, UK, Australia. Most have new laws to try to stop or ease up on these but that ISNT what houses were supposed to be for.  
Also, why are houses higher than the last time there was a bubble that had to pop but we don't see higher wages in any of these countries? And none of the under 35's believe they will EVER own a house. The longer they live their lives believing that, the more likely it is to come true. 
You also have developers, realtors and bankers saying we need to keep tearing down perfectly find structures to build something new just so they can get their fees in between this "progress."
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:25:39
Why would products produced have any bearing on the currency used to purchase them? the 7 digits in bitcoin have SIDE CHAINS and SECOND LAYERS -- that will be the MONEY. 
You have different trade offs for different side chains and second layers (LN, Liquid) and part of those are cost and anonymity. You buy small amounts of those with your bitcoin, OR they will work with one of your bitcoin wallets you assign.
It is the first new asset class available to humans in a century. It is the first time people can hold a bank account by ONLY having internet access. The fundamentals for bitcoin to be used as a currency in the future are ACTUALLY there.
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:02:52
Fiat goes in Fiat comes out... 
Rate of return depends on time and assets strength surrounding (stocks, bonds, equity, currencies, property, precious metals) bitcoin as an asset :) 
When market assets are no longer safe, gold and bitcoin look very attractive. The housing market and stock market and/or currency markets will correct to show more stability/trust than it does currently and get people buying into that asset class again with their bitcoin/gold gains. 
Bitcoin doesn't compete as much as it stabilizes and keeps the other assets in check when bubbles and bullshit have flooded the system. Flush it out then we move back into those asset classes with increased trust and security.

The only digital money we have so far is bitcoin and traders sell this idea people can make easy money swapping shitcoins... what happens if there is no bitcoin to fund all of the shitcoin trading? We arent going to start funding trading shitcoins with USD, Euros, GBP and 100 other national currencies -- we NEED A global digital currency BUT its value is depreciated constantly to fund shitcoin trading 
You want to trade shitcoin cool... you want sound money good luck finding it while stuff like XRP sucks peoples bitcoin away

It's 100 years away for this last coin to be mined. 
Simply start another blockchain, with the same protocol 50 years from now and people can mine two chains of the SAME protocol with different value of the bitcoins. Bitcoin and Bitcoin 2100 (same developers/security updates as current bitcoin) 
That's a 5 min plan I came up with, Im sure over the next 100 years someone will have a better idea than that for peoples money to be safe.

fiat and bitcoin co-exist and always will 


We are in a currency war because the **Keynesian idiots** have been preaching this bullshit. Central banks can only increase the supply of currency and change the rate of interest that it is lent... look around you!!! They are out of tools and know that weak currency will get wiped out soon.....VERY soon. 
The Bolivar in Venezuela, Argentine Peso, British Pound during a no deal Brexit, the Eurozone bailouts - threats Italy wants off the Euro now, PLUS the US/China "trade war" has the Yuan devaluing and Trump yelling at the Fed he wants his dollar devalued (he shouldnt tell the central bank what to do btw -- these are insane times) 
Quantitative easing doesnt matter when every fiat currency printed too much DEBT. Its everywhere and the monthly cost of that debt are getting so high in places that the globally economy needs to "wash out the crap" -- hence we are in a currency war. 
Buy bitcoin or gold and hold the fuck on. You dont want your assets or currency tied to a national currency right now... any of them.

@_date: 2019-08-06 08:35:19


Correct. Its value in fiat seems quite high though. Assuming the younger generation never wants to buy it, if they can afford to, could it all possibly be overvalued currently? 
Also, if stocks, bonds and housing are overvalued (since they are priced in fiat currencies -- that are overvalued), how much would a correction cost the owners of those assets?

You lost 30% of your spending power holding the Pound on the day of the vote vs holding bitcoin (or anything else really). Not that the Pound hasnt recovered somewhat since that day but bitcoin and gold wont change value based on one countries politics or an economic shift.
Bitcoin just solves blocks every 10 minutes to store value and allow it to be transferred between two parties without intermediaries. That's ALL it does...  
These China tariffs with US, will affect USD and Yuan. The Euro is just sitting there waiting to bail out another member of their glorious financial system!! 
Bitcoin and gold are investments in sovereign money, not the "pay for war" currency that politicians and their banker friends fuck around with all the time.

Liquid and Lightning network cost sats but will are DIFFERENT currencies -- there will be another 5 or 6 currencies on side chains and second layers in a decade. Bitcoin is just the SETTLEMENT layer. 
We arent breaking sats into anything, we buy second, third layers that work with bitcoin with small amounts of our bitcoin.

Bitcoin isnt one thing, to even understand it takes a couple years for intelligent people. 
Do they understand how money is created? How inflation works? How the forex markets affect the spending power of our national currencies?
You also have the banks and government throwing sound bites at the media so the masses are "confused" and dont trust whatever this confusing bitcoin thing is. People can understand the Presidential race or debate gun ownership wayyy more easily than learn about economics and how money works. 
There is 250 trillion in global debt and nobody will talk about the currency war going on right now, it will probably change the way we look at all money and assets in the future. 
That's not even a pitch for bitcoin, it's just so obvious fiat currencies days are numbered though.

why do you want to spend something worth $8000 per coin that is primarily in accumulation phase among the adopters currently, at such small amounts? 
Use fiat or wait for a 2nd layer like LN or Liquid payments to make such small transfers. If its life changing not to be able to send pennies with your digital gold right now, then bitcoin isnt going to be enjoyable for you.
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:16:29
Bitcoin is a decentralized store of value that can be transferred between two parties without needing intermediaries.

Loans and credit aren't the aspect of banking that bitcoin disrupts and that area is probably the most profit anyways.
Also, national banks money forces the holder to be subject to monetary policy changes whenever the government changes. You can't pretend that inflation, interest rates and what the current government in power want, don't have an effect the holders of a currencies spending power.

the dollar is devalued constantly because of inflation that you dont see and monetary policy that changes the amount of currency printed by every central bank. 
So the theory is to hold gold or bitcoin (which governments cant control) and it is sovereign money. Gold has 1000 years of proof as being useful as money, bitcoin has 10 years proof as a currency.

The court, lawyers, banks and law enforcement... you have ZERO faith that this would be addressed a few times by intelligent people to see that it is on the up and up? being so cynical isnt going to make the company solvent. 
Dying from issues related to Chron's happens... especially if he wasnt treating the disease properly... some people dont like the steroids and other drugs you have to take when it flairs up. 
The court, banks, lawyers and law enforcement will probably go through this stuff...relax. 
India isn't medically incompetent, everyone knows to drink bottled water there. Crohn's and how he treated it, isn't something we're privy to what exactly happened...that doesnt mean he did not die.  
The family probably tried to get into the deceased CEO's computers to see if accessing things he only held the keys to is possible... it makes complete sense that they would try to get experts on this and try to figure out his passwords to get peoples coins sorted... 
Not everyone is a scammer in the world just because you dont like how his family is handling his death and how he ran his company when he was alive. 
EDIT: Her affidavit has been filed saying again he is deceased, she is either breaking the law now or HE IS DEAD.

Tech companies adoption/innovation over time is different than money. You need to include currencies and valuations over time for a comparison, not "better tech wins" because these aren't the same... 
If someone wants to build a better way to create money that is fair for everyone like bitcoin is AND have no incentives or backdoors possible AND the potential to convince the 30 million bitcoin holders that THIS NEW THING is secure and valuable... SURE. 
Nobody is going to build that. 
Trust/security over time are valuable with people's money in addition to adoption. Go and find trust and security created by better cryptographic developers than bitcoin has that somehow convinces the world this. You cant.

no, blockchain is just a digital ledger, that's nothing new or innovative. 
Proof of work = Store of Value (a way to prove work was done to "mine" the item")  money was spent to get it, verified by other miners who spent money to try and mine it. 
Much different than a digital ledger a central bank holds the keys to and tells holders of money the value is increasing or decreasing. 
How the fiat world assesses value for this item that is "provably fair and equal" to all who own or use it as money, that is the million dollar question.

No. Just dont.


Bitcoin works as a gold right now, I send payments in Asia, Latin America, Mexico, Europe and UK all the time. I actually prefer paying people with bitcoin as the bank to bank solutions suck for wiring funds internationally. 
Second, third layers and site chains are going to be added over the next decade. Bitcoin is only a decade old now. Within another 10 years we are going to have competition with LN and other solutions for payments I would imagine. 
One I want to see -- an altcoin I can sign permission to my first layer (bitcoin) wallet. This altcoin can be transferred P2P and "grab" from my first layer for the holder of that token within 24 hrs. 
Like I dont need my friends bitcoin, he can just send me the promissory note in digital format. Then that layer settles my friends bitcoin to my bitcoin wallet by the next day. 
Something that makes the base layer not moving easily less of a concern...things that transact with that layer later acting as irreversible promises to pay of some sort.  
There will be tons of different solutions because they can all build businesses around these and compete on fees like exchanges compete on fees currently.

No because bitcoin requires work to mine. It will cost a miner thousands of dollars in electricity just to be part of the mining pool that gets to mine the bitcoin. 
"crypto" has nothing to do with that but people lump them together to prove their ignorance. 
Fiat currency is a "created" digital money, along with many Alt-coins. Bitcoin has a monetary policy that includes PROOF OF WORK and fixed supply that other currencies don't.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:39:25






How will they make people with money value this "cryptographic currency" they create? 
And how will they convince the 30 million bitcoin holders that they created a better form of sound money? 
Logic costs nothing to use but so many in crypto avoid it. You cant create money then tell people they need to value it as money and THEN expect people will just value it as money. It doesnt work like that.


Go and name a "crypto" that is trying to be digital money. There are crypto that do different things, there is nothing anyone takes serious as possibly being digital money like bitcoin. Look at Tether and the SEC news today for a good example.

How to make a decent return by storing your dirty fiat in Bitcoin, in 3 simple steps:

2. Only put money you don't need for 10 years  into bitcoin
3. Never think of the price except "should I sell some" every year or two

You can't just make bitcoin be whatever you want it to be and then get upset about how people use it. 
It's a store of value and medium of exchange, what people do with it is their business. 
If it is as valuable as most of us believe, why would we spend more than 5% of our holdings before the masses realize this? 
The swings will last a decade while everyone scratches their heads asking "what the fuck is this stuff actually worth?" because we've always been taught that value is defined by the "market". The market has always been "regulated" (controlled) by bankers and governments.... this isn't.

it's being adopted first by people who get legitimately screwed by central banks biggest flaws (venezuela, argentina, brazil, south africa, kenya, china, india). 
We can have two economies in future, one with fiat and one on digital gold. The global money (that cant be rigged by the printers) will win over time. 
The existing "stable" fiats steal wealth for the "weak" currencies on the global market. As those weak currencies die, the stable ones have a problem if people don't adopt their currency

The gap between rich and poor will only increase in our current economic environment. Majority of people don't have savings even. 
My point of open source was that it allows access to an asset with set rules, that are deemed "fair" or not for everyone. 
Fiat will never do that. 
The Rupee, Real, Bolivar, Argentine Peso, Ruble, Rand and Lira are all shaky as hell for national currencies. Whichever ones die this year, the citizens will store money in gold or bitcoin. 
Those people can't go to the USD, EUR, GBP or Yuan because THOSE currencies are in a fight right now to maintain value after printing so many bills... 
The global debt is $250 Trillion....a lot of that is in pension funds and other things that will topple in the coming years....

This needs to be decided in 2100 because the last one will mine around 2149. 
My GUESS is the same bitcoin core protocol can start a new blockchain around 2100 and people can buy BTC(2) from $0.01 (or whatever) again...while the existing chain is still exponentially more valuable based on the time/network/security already in place. 
Some will move early to the other blockchain, some will be "new" adopters hodling and some stay on the main chain forever.

You're using the current 12 month period, versus the 10 year period people have had to buy bitcoin just to make your point though. 
There were 8 years worth of "speculators" that have hedged against inflation buying bitcoin under $3000.
Then more speculators came in to create an insane bubble. That bubble carried over into altcoins. 
In 12-24 months we will all see what the loses were for people speculating on bitcoin and altcoins this year and how dumb purchasing any of these were.

Fiats will continue to show their true value as printed money while society transfers wealth into other stores of value. 
Gold and real estate have been safe havens for years, the housing bubbles everywhere are concerning people though. Gold isn't going up. 
My original statement about 8-15 year was more about not investing short term if you are buying bitcoin currently. Westerners that are speculating for the short term will probably get rekt.

This and bitcoin ATM's get disrupted within 10 years by an app. Easily. 
You could have functionality for selling $50 - $500 of bitcoin for cash and just meetup with buyers and sellers anywhere. Mycelium trader already does this, although it is still hit and miss for users currently. 
These machines are huge and just ripe for disruption after a few years of this. The Coinstar ones have lower fee's than *some* of the ATM's, which at least gives buyers some choice now. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:33:53
Remove the boxes, give the store an app. 
The stores have fucking cash registers already, why add a stupid box to sit there taking up space. 
Especially those small convenience stores that are selling cigarettes and phone minute cards. And the ones that have buy and sell gold signs everywhere, just add the sale and purchase of bitcoin for another stupid thing people rarely want over time.

For future reference op,  you want to buy the bitcoin and transfer the bitcoin to a non-custodial bitcoin wallet.
That way you hold the bitcoin, rather than a custodian holding your bitcoin (that may or may not exist) and you get bad news the day you want to "cash out" 
Rule number 1 in bitcoin "not your keys, not your coins" we all follow it and repeat it to newbies over and over.

It's a pre-mined shitcoin that doesnt actually store value. The SEC is still debating whether certain founders of Ethereum should go to jail or pay fines for the ICO's they consulted on and took fees for in 2017.

Find a new coin that everyone with bitcoin agrees is valuable AND trustworthy enough to move their bitcoin into that new thing...there are only 30 million holders of bitcoin to convince. 
Then you have to convince the rest of the non-crypto people that this new coin is somehow better than the bitcoin-thing and explain what the problem was with bitcoin for money holders.
This also has to happen during a period central banks are fighting over whose national currency is the shittiest right now and devaluing their currency.... they will likely introduce a "crypto" thing through the world bank or IMF to keep talk of backing currencies with gold down.

These things add up globally, with more banking customers wanting transparency. Luckily for them Bitcoin as money is still about a decade away, it works great as a store of value, let's be realistic about how it easy it is to use right now. 
Fiat currencies need to pull a new rabbit out of their hat before the side chains and 2nd layers make payments on bitcoin that much easier. 
Whenever people realize the inflationary currencies will always buy them less goods and deflationary currencies increase their purchasing power over time, it's pretty much over for every governments national currencies.

America sanctions Russia to lower the countries wealth, the fight with Iran has the same effect -- countries try to starve Nations now rather than throw bombs. If the people starve, it's easier to take over the country. 
Even the trade war with China is a currency war, they devalued the Yuan making it obvious they want it cheap for others to buy from China still.... 
Bitcoin is one of the few stores of value (perhaps a better currency in 10 years) that isn't weaponized by central bankers colluding with politicians.

what does that have to do with the bitcoin sub? Or the topic of Forbes articles being spammy af... nobody here is pushing alt coins. 


Name another asset that a human could have held in the last decade that would increase in value by 5-500% for the holders? 
By similar you need to find something the media, government and financial industry have attacked constantly, claiming it is a scam and telling the holders it is going to 0 for almost a decade, while consistently increasing in value yearly....

My point was the increasingly weaponized dollar. Russia sanctions remove them from dealing in the international financial markets, they wouldnt have increased trade deals with China so much had the sanctions not been imposed. 
Overall the point was that isnt what money is meant for. A dollar should be a dollar (used to buy and sell goods) regardless of your political affiliation.

The global economy and central bank announcements this last two months have created the perfect storm for bitcoin though 
This is what it was made for... go buy gold I guess....who the hell wants a national currency in this climate?!? They're all fighting to devalue....during brexit, Italy wanting off the Euro, Trump yelling at the Fed to devalue the US dollar and the Yuan devalued already to fight the tariffs... 
What could make it more glaringly obvious to people that National Currencies are probably going to die off. The governments need to cut expenses but WONT DO IT because people are paying them and their friends to do this shit every 8-10 years.
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:54:03
Logic says you are correct, history shows they always re-frame the "error" and place blame elsewhere. 
China and the Yuan will be blamed while the Western currencies pegged to US dollars keep dying off. Everyone is going to take a haircut while people learn about inflation and money printing wanting a currency to store value. 
inevitably all the central banks attack bitcoin and create some digital thing they can fuck with whenever they want and force citizens to accept it as better. 
then 15 years later the centralized pre-mined shitcoin the IMF and World Bank pushed on everyone breathes its last breath and dies like they all do 
I dont even know if is good or bad for bitcoin tbh, they definitely going to create something to make fiat look "better" than it is lol

now you are thinking like a real adopter :) 
You want your purchases and sales for bitcoin into fiat and vice versa anonymous. Maybe you would want to use a service like hodlhodl or bisq, maybe even meetup group in your area to swap cash and crypto. 
Anything else is still tracked through a lot of the larger exchanges. Cash out at ATM in a different country wont be a prob, the FEES will make you wish you paid taxes on it in most places. 
There will probably be more and more options for swapping over 10 years, hence making hodl mode easy for most people that have a little btc on the side. Anything requiring ID is obv going to be tracked and sent through government databases.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:11:13
Oh I should have been more clear, this app requires you to give your crypto to Gemini as custodian (if Im reading this right) 
I'd prefer an anonymous way to transact like cash using crypto and not pay a company to make sure the US government approves of how I use money. Having it all tracked and requiring KYC is just bringing us back into bank systems that cost us to be babysit.
Above that, I would want one larger transaction on blockchain to fiat (or vice versa) that way I dont hold crypto in a custodial wallet (the winkelvi own it technically) and they swap it with fee whenever you buy anything from that wallet. Why not just swap 1 larger amount instead of these swaps for things like coffee.... I can guesstimate how much $$ I need any week/month to get by.

The same elites that store their money off shore will probably have more than enough time to store it in bitcoin. They are the ones who need the most privacy and security with their money over the long run. 


It depends how much the governments want to fight. Bankers will be in both sides while fiat and bitcoin fight. You will have a % of citizens using it as money and a % of citizens slowly going broke. Or you have two communities everywhere.

If all you want is to take out currency in any country with an asset like gold would serve in those shops you see buying gold everywhere, bitcoin is doing what I want it to do. 
Forget 2X or 10X bullshit, I lose .5-1% swapping USD to other currencies and the same moving them back to USD later. IF all I want to do is cover the on-ramp and off-ramp fees to hold gold and not lose money, bitcoin is working 100% perfectly for what I need it to do. 
People are to greedy to realize what it DOES. 
It does exactly what I want it to with every $1000 put in, provided I dont want an immediate return or buy it during crazy fomo months.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:58:30
There is a book on gold called currency wars that is really good background for a noob (even though it is "gold bug" book). The concept is the same for bitcoin and gold. 
180 currencies compete on the global markets to starve each others countries (or be the most valuable currency -- however you want to see it). If you sanction Russia's Ruble or China's Yuan from the markets US controls, they have to find a way to keep their currency stable without the financial markets the US controls. 
You can buy gold or bitcoin to avoid the problems a national currency may create in your life. Look at ANY currency that drops in value for a few years and realize your dollar purchasing power went down, the assets you own in those dollars are down, the stocks and bonds you hold in that currency are devalued as well. 
Gold and Bitcoin are available globally and are not tied to one nations economy or politics. It is a hedge against currencies being messed with on the markets.... look at the Euro, Pound, Rupee, Pesos...some of these currencies are fucking weak the next few years.

Nic Carter puts it at 40 million if I recall correct... still a lot of people 
What WILL happen for sure is that central bank cash gets more and more difficult to transact anonymously for anything. The fees banks take (including inflation) are going to continue to rob us all while the central banks roll out a digital fiat they may or may not "brand" as crypto. 
Bank of Canada was already caught in 2016 "testing" a crypto coin that was leaked to media after they showed it at some financial summit what their results were. Sweden is moving to something like a crypto very soon. 
Some of us will want an alternative digital currency at that point. There is NO REASON to keep paper money and coins being minted in this day and age, that is just obvious. 
So when some of us want a digital "sound money" that governments can control of confiscate, currently bitcoin IS the best option for that. 
IF there were some competitor in the future (that convinces millions of people to move to a "new coin") the people holding bitcoin would have ample time to move small and large amounts of bitcoin into THAT new coin (very unlikely)

Education over time. 
Thats it. 
Fiats rob us, banks overcharge us and privacy is no long a right with money
Education over time brings more people to need bitcoin rather than speculate with it. 
Right now, we are still watching Asia, South America and Africa to see which of these make the biggest move in bitcoin. Westerners dont NEED banking or sound money as badly as a lot of those countries. 
Notice it was just banned in India but look at the Rupee over 10 years, it lost value for anyone holding it. People their valued gold for the last 100 years more than any of the paper money, now they are learning about bitcoin. 
Education over time. Its a forgone conclusion with how banking works everywhere.

I thought part of it was that Bitcoin hadnt actually died after MTGOX and people realized if the thing worked then other things could potentially launch/work as well. 
Then ETH launches allowing the ease of tokens, almost no work to create a "project" or stock really without giving investors ownership. And that created more madness because ETH IS a good idea, how that one plays out over time though... 
Hell even Bitcoin, hodlers still have expectations how side chains, second layers will work and when. Im cool to wait another 10 years for it but the protocol will be attacked constantly by bankers and "crypto" wanna-be's.

What do the gas taxes and monthly healthcare payments go towards? The sales tax, income tax, property tax, alcohol, cigarettes and everything else they can tax after inflation eats away the value of the dollars. 
Why not hold money and pay taxes differently in communities, possibly based on consumption rather than all this weird shit we do "because that's how it worked 40 years ago" 
To say money creation today (for the first time) would be anything like we hold now would be insane. We should look at all of the effects sound money would have on a society and make changes according to what is best for the communities to continue fairly unchanged. 
For example, we all agree on police and firemen being useful, pretty sure a community can still pay taxes yearly and actually see where taxes go, rather this convoluted mess we've lived with forever. 
This is a taboo subject though because trade wars and which politician entertains the media most is what we're willing to consume and cater to advertising dollars funding that.

yeah but you all are crazy to think bitcoin isnt going to force the central banks hands at some point? 
We have a thousand people bitching daily that bitcoin payments wont scale and eventually (Im guessing 10 years) we can easily go phone to phone payments anywhere with 1 - 3 side chains or 2nd layer solutions. 
So then what is a bank supposed to do? Print paper dollars and mint coins for people who can transaction outside of their banking system digitally anonymously? What for? 
There is going to be a digital fiat (marketed as "crypto") and there will still be bitcoin. This is why we are all stacking sats while they are cheap af. 
Dont pretend we are keeping an analogue money system because a few people like holding paper and coins that lose value the second they get them. Move your shit to bitcoin, gold or get rekt.

Bitcoin gains value and strength every 10 minutes blocks are solved? It's been undervalued for about 8 months? 
It depends where you think the "value" of bitcoin is at right now against USD which is relative to the individual. 
Fiat is not gaining value anywhere anytime soon. Stocks and Property both have people shouting bubble, again it depends what you value and where you think the world is going. 
Bitcoin and Gold are the only sovereign wealth stores of value. Go with either if you believe a lot of countries are about to get fucked up in global finance.

Nope. 
Countries using fiat will ALWAYS end with the people's wealth being stolen through inflation, interest rate increases, property/gas/alcohol taxes increasing yearly (more inflation) and over printing of the fiat money supply (that can't be audited).

There is no "getting rich" there is only getting sound money.
To your question... So if we hit again 20k or even more lets say 100k. Wouldnt that made soooo much people millionair?
No because most people are going to be holding and spending bitcoin the next ten years, some getting out entirely. What if its 20 years until the next bullrun? A lot of people that want to "get rich" will be gone, the believers in sound money will see a decent gain on their sound money.

Those were always hedges against fiats inflation, problem is they are both valued in the fiat of your country. 
Stocks were pumped after the housing crisis bailout so bankers could still earn decent returns.

When GBP dropped 30% the day Brexit Yes vote happened, the stocks on London Exchange didnt pump to compensate for that. 
You sell your stocks for GBP that is 30% less valuable than it was the day before and it is NOT increasing the value of your stock to compensate for a drop against the USD.
Same with the property you sell in UK. You are losing purchasing power with events like these affecting the value of your assets and stocks in these currencies.
It is like the hidden inflation, except the currency was devalued and you are selling things for that specific currency.

No, people come into bitcoin creating these ideas of what they want bitcoin to do. Bitcoin (protocol) securely sends bitcoin transactions between two parties without the need for intermediaries. 
That's all it does. 
If a country bans it....people in that country will acquire it in back rooms, so they can store that countries currency into a decentralized store of value that can be sold anywhere else in the world.

DO NOT send your bitcoin from a gambling site to an exchange wallet. Most people do 1 hop (at least) before sending bitcoin into the custodial (exchange) wallet. 
Some people go into wasabi wallet, mixer or just hodl. Fiat makes you a real gambler though op.

2018 was hedge funds removing the billions they pumped into crypto end of last year after buying short positions. 
Most people in November were calling for a drop, even long term hodler's knew "this isn't normal" but it kept going up in December... made no sense. For someone to have seen November as a newbie and think "this looks easy" would be idiotic.

There are always these political situations that devalue a currency and the holders of money in the country have to accept the Keynesian line of "thats just how money works" 
This will be interesting a decade from now to see how its all played out. People are getting extremely aware of how money works and that there is a problem, not sure ANYONE has the actual solution correct obv.

The chances of 1 out of the 180 National Currencies dying over the next 10 years is far greater than the internet dying... IF the internet works then a person can have a bitcoin wallet, hold and transfer bitcoin as a currency. 
Look at all the currencies that are losing value over the last 10 years and ask why you would want to hold the Rupee or Ruble. Or the Turkish Lira. 
Everyone lives in their National currencies bubble not realizing that global money is actually useful and hedges against fiat actually make a lot of sense from time to time.

It's legal to own and sell. There are registered/regulated companies within the US buying and selling bitcoin for a few years now. There are ATM's throughout the country for the same purpose. The IRS has tax regulations on bitcoin written specifically for it.... what makes you think it's becoming illegal at any time? 
And IF it was made illegal, would people have to turn in their bitcoin they own legally now, like they did their gold in the 1930's? People lost millions when the government did that, don't think that would happen easily again.

Nobody is buying bitcoin with money they wouldnt just shove in a savings account for 5 - 10 years

Treat it like a savings account and you are fine... its 5 - 10 years money... 
Difference is: 
You get more than 1% interest (in theory) over 10 years 
You can convert BTC to any fiat currency you want anywhere in the world without needing the bankers to help you 
Even on the small chance there is a "better bitcoin" (not likely ever) you can swap bitcoin to that loooonnngg before the rally
Plus you can buy drugs online with it and other illegal shit!!!

You act as though the "problems" that arrive from the additional layers wouldn't be solved throughout the next decade, so there isn't much point arguing. The developers are working on what they are working on, to call it a "failed" protocol seems rather negative. 
When the blocks aren't solved every 10 minutes or the value is $0 for people to sell a bitcoin, it would make more sense to claim it's failed. 


There are assets that went from 0 to $1 valuations to $10, then up to $100 and then $1000 this decade? Do tell... Are they new asset classes recognized by governments around the world?

But the more people stop believing in that system, the more fucked they are. 
How many times have people been let down by the current global economic policies and told "it will get better now" only to find out it's a lie. 
People kind of disliked banks before, now we have a society (regardless of bitcoin) that the majority would prefer to not have to deal with oligopoly national banking systems. 
They over reached for decades charging people too much to hold and transfer their money.... nobody CARES if banks or cell phone apps hold their money. 
People care about having easy access to use and control their money. The banks aren't innovating how to transfer money (governments won't always let them), but crypto is doing that.

Thought it was more of a problem that so many "crypto" products/services want people to change their bitcoin to some token and not support bitcoin at all.

@_date: 2019-05-13 18:03:53


I think it is already past gold, I've never met anyone who purchased something with gold but know lots who have used bitcoin to buy things. 
It moves easier now and is harder to seize as far as stores of value go. Once the 2nd and 3rd layers for payments become more clear over the next decade, its going to be the most valuable currency/store of value we've ever held. 
Currently it is a really cool store of value. You just have to buy that "value" at the right spots or wait 5 years for that value to be stored at equal value or higher.
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:22:33
lol the buying was always during Asian trading hours consistently and Trade Wars being in the headlines seem to at LEAST have a bit of connection.

No, his equipment works or it doesnt... this productivity argument is baseless. 


Housing is inflated. How come the majority of 18 - 35 year olds plan to NEVER buy a house? Because people "hold wealth" in houses... this keeps inflation "acceptable" to homeowners (unless another housing crash comes) and keeps the lower income from ever owning property. The rate of inflation and tax increases on property will continue to keep the actual cost much higher than it "appears" to own property currently. 


The housing market needs to crash, it's obviously an inflated bubble. Store your money in gold or bitcoin until Fiat isn't rigged by bankers and the housing prices come down.

@_date: 2019-05-12 22:33:47
No but we can have two or three economies technically... Fiat, Bitcoin and Gold. Let everyone value what they want and transact how they're most comfortable over the long term. 
Currently Bitcoin is NOT close to anyone's preferred way to transact and neither is gold. Give the geeks 10 years and see what they do. Central banks see the threat and react to how cheaply and easily people transact with this "thing" its a forgone conclusion bitcoin will continue to be adopted as money everywhere. 
When it was on par with USD, that was weird. When it was $10 to 1BTC that was really weird...Can't see how banks will provide a better store of value once stability comes to bitcoin and fiats keep inflating and plunging in value.
