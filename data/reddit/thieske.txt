Segwit transactions are in the same blocks as other transactions. So your question is a bit strange.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:13:43
I don't understand in what way a node would contribute to the network that way.
Not even talking about the blocks you have to download when you reconnect.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:26:17
I think they will get confirmed within an hour. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:30:41
This is an option you can try:  Add your transaction here at exactly XX:00 clock. They accept 100 free transactions an hour, the count resets at the full hour so be sure to be on time. When you are able to add your transaction it will be confirmed the moment ViaBTC mines a block. (On  you can follow the blocks which are mined) 
It may take you a few times to go through cause the site is very populair.
Good luck.

There are 11823 bitcoins nodes around the world at the moment.
Why all that effort to add 6? I don't think they will make the difference.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:57:13
Oke, believe your own truth. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:03:32
Yes in a few we need to pay to be allowed to have BTC cause we dive under the zero line.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:59:01
True, but it's still declining. Also with 6 blocks an hour.
Also: Average blocks found 6.93/hr (time period, 2 weeks)

No, once your transaction gets confirmed. (which means it's put in a block by a miner) the other confirmations go automatically when the next blocks are mined. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:25:13
Blocks found last 6 hours: 5.83 p/h
Blocks found last 24 hours: 7.04 p/h
So that's not exponential high. 
Next difficulty increase if it would happen right now: 13,78%
Also not very extreme. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:38:20
Check this site: 
It displays the waiting transactions in the mempool to get confirmed.
The transactions with the highest fee's per byte are confirmed the first. 
As you can see here:  
your transaction has 134.048 sat fee per byte.
So your transaction is in the black layer of the graph. About every 10 minutes a block is mined that's when you see the graph go downwards.
In this way you can roughly keep track on when your transaction will get confirmed.

@_date: 2018-01-26 20:27:46
Lower transaction volume. Bitcoin was a hype at the end of 2017. The dust is settled down a bit now. (after the price dropped).
So, less transactions and the mempool is clearing up.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:51:38
More nodes don't speed up the network so having nodes on a mobile device isn't a solution for the fee's or the waiting transactions.
The good thing about having more nodes is more decentralization of the network which is one of the key points of BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:49:57
Last 3 hours every transaction with a fee above 100 satoshi a byte was confirmed in the next block.
Last 8 hours every transaction 140+ was confirmed within 2 blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:00:18
It doesn't help you but my node also needed about 10 days to sync the headers. So maybe it's not very exceptional.

I think you do understand it now. 
Check this site for stats about Segwit transactions in the blocks that are mined right now. :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:05:10
It's not that when you use a segwit adress you immidiatly have to pay less fee.
The fact is that if a lot of users use segwit it's possible to put more transactions into a block. Which results in less transactions waiting to confirm which results in lower fee's
So yes, please start using segwit addresses but don't expect low fees immediately when using them.
Sorry for my bad english too ;)
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:18:53

No I think you didn't lose any BTC.
I'm not sure but i think this is what happens:
Blockchain.info sends out the total amount of BTC out of your wallet. 0.027 BTC of the total amount goes to the address you wanted. The rest of the amount goes back to a blockchain.info address which is also connected to your wallet.
Like i said i'm not totally sure but i also had this kind of experience with another wallet. And it worked out that way for me.

"Transaction added to acceleration queue"
I was able to add your transaction to the accelerator. Next time ViaBTC mines a block it will get confirmed.. :)

Mining in those days didn't use that amount of data. Even now you don't need 600GB free disk space to mine.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:33:55
This isn't the case.
The difficulty increased yesterday with 15%. Blocks are mined now at a speed of 6.46 an hour (the avarege of the last 24 hours)
So that's isn't that much higher than they were mined when the mempool was full of unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:18:40
Go to your exodus bitcoin wallet. When you push on the BTC sign on the top (above the amount of BTC) you can rescan the blockchain.
Maybe this helps. A restart also does the trick sometimes. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:33:59
I tried to add your transaction again and got a weird error so i decided to look up your transaction a bit more closely.
And saw something weird. 
Your transaction: 
If you look at the left you see the addresses where the BTC come from.
When i click the first address of that list of 6 i get this:
A list of all transactions belonging to that adress. All transactions are confirmed, except yours. No problems.
When i click the third address of that list of 6 i get this:
There i see something weird, there is one more unconfirmed transactions besides yours. That transactions has to be confirmed before yours is able to confirm. Simply because it's impossible to send bitcoins from this adress to you if they never arrived/ are confirmed on the adress you get them from.
The same problem i see on the 6th adress of the list of 6.
Possible solution:
We have to try to add those 2 unconfirmed transactions: 8f3aacaeb5162edacfb203e845541ce66e2518db2584be87069dc1bedc7df7cc and bc4dbb34179f19691f8430931043129004ec1258314760758ab38507bd11843c to the Viabtc accelerator and when they are confirmed it's possible to add yours.
English isn't my native language so i hope what i try to tell you is clear. ;)

@_date: 2017-12-02 21:07:50
It isn't rocket science. How can I help you to understand it?
The site shows you all unconfirmed transactions. Transactions get confirmed by mining blocks, every about 10  minutes a block is mined. The waiting transactions with the highest fees gets confirmed first.
So, if you know how much fee per byte your transaction is you can see where in the waiting line your transaction is.

Exodus uses more than one BTC adress for its wallet. Are you sure you are looking up the right adress on the blockchain?
I have exodus on my mac, there you can look up which BTC adresses are used in your wallet this way:
- go to the left upper corner of your screen and go to Exodus ---&gt; Developer ---&gt; Assets ---&gt; Bitcoin ---&gt; Export adress. 
Now there is a file on your desktop which contains all the addresses used by your Exodus wallet. So you can look them up at blockchain.info

Here you can see the actual pool of waiting transactions to get confirmed. Transactions get confirmed by miners who put them in a block. About every 10 minutes a block is mined.

 Bitcoins don't lose value at the moment cause the demand of bitcoins is higher than the supply of new bitcoins
 Nothing
 Every transaction of bitcoins needs a fee. When all bitcoins are mined, miners will continue to mine blocks to get the fee reward.
Edit:  Why is my post in bold? :P
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:35:07
I tell them the story about the first train. The first reaction was: we don't need a train we have a horse.
I tell them the story about the first mobile phone. The first reaction of most people was: we don't need a mobile phone, i already have one on my wall at home.
I tell them about the internet and email. The first reaction of most people was: we don't need email, we can already write a letter.
And than i tell them about bitcoin. And say: Your first reaction is, we don't need bitcoin, we already have dollars.
Think again. 
Oh and to answer your question, dollars are also value out of nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:10:05
If you reduce the fee to 5sat/byte you have to wait a few weeks before it gets confirmed. If you are lucky.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:45:38
Before that time the site showed only a layer of 0-5 satoshi.So they just added a new layer defining the 1-2 satoshi a byte.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:44:41
Yes. Blocks are mined every 10 minutes. Miners will add transactions with the high fees at first.
So you need to find out your transaction fee per byte. Go to  and lookup your transaction there. 
If you know your fee per byte you can look at this site: 
There you can look up in which layer your transaction is. And you can predict when yours will confirm. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:41:49
No you are not able to do the same or you must have connections with miners.
That's how those sites work. They are miners by themselves, so they can decide which transactions to put in a block they mine. OR they have a good relationship with miners who are willing to help them.

And no, a few machines from your home isn't enough to mine a block by yourself those days. 
I think it's time for you to look up more about they way BTC works cause by asking this questions it's clear to me you didn't do some research about it yet. Have fun reading. ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:32:36
Also you can check on this site  what your transaction fee per byte is.
After that you can lookup at this site:  where in the row of unconfirmed transactions yours is at the moment.
As you can see there, at the moment only 300+ sat/byte fee transactions are confirming now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:38:04
Yes, add your transaction at xx:00 exactly! They allow only 100 an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:50:21
Can you give the transaction ID so we can see how much the fee per byte is?

The mempool (the pool of unconfirmed transactions) is slowly clearing up at the moment.
Here you can see that proces: 
Your transaction is in the red layer so it's gonna take a while before it gets confirmed. So i'm afraid you have to be patient.
When a transaction isn't confirmed in 14 days they say most nodes reject the transaction which means the BTC return to your wallet. (but i have no experience with that scenario so i'm not really sure if its true).
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:31:23
Good explanation about what's happening at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:14:16
If they did send you a key it's possibly the private key of an bitcoin address. In that case you are looking for a 51 characters long key starting with the number 5.

Did you even read his post? It was all about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:48:28
True, we did not reach a new all time high, yet.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:11:31
It looks like you are using Bitcoin Core as wallet. 
Bitcoin core is a wallet for a more advanced user and has to download the total blockchain (100+ GB) before you can see recent transactions.
As you see on the bottom of your wallet, your wallet is still downloading (your wallet is 3 years behind now, look at the bottom where you can see that )
The only solution now is waiting until your wallet is synchronized but that will going to take a while.
Next time use a light wallet, Electrum for example, where you don't need to download the total blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:04:38
At the moment all available coins are also already owned. So there is no difference with the situation in the future when all coins are mined.
If you want bitcoins you have to pay a price which is high enough to convince someone to sell them to you. That's exactly how the price of a bitcoin is created.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:21:49
It's confirmed now so i hope you see it in your wallet now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:46:55
The broker isn't buying your bitcoins, another customer is. 
Please think before you post.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:53:18
I had that feeling when it reached $500 - $1000 - $2000 -$4000 - $6000 and now i have it again but history proofed me wrong. :D
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:37:56
I'm going to try to explain this:
When i have a wallet i can generate an address i want to receive my bitcoins on. So i tell person A i want to reicive 0,5 bitcoins on adres XXX1
After that i generate a new adress, let's say XXX2. I let person B send 0,25 bitcoins to address XXX2.
Now i have 0,75 BTC in my wallet. When i want to send those to person C i have to send 0,5 BTC from XXX1 and 0,25 from XXX2 to the receiving adress of person C. 
That's exactly what you see in those transactions. 
I hope my explanation is clear cause it's hard to visualize by words. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:39
I don't see the problem.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:49:49
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:38:34
What's the fee?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:47:01
Yesterday i had more than $10K bitcoin. Today i haven't anymore. So yesterday i could say HODL and now I am not allowed anymore? 
Okay, lol.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:48:40
Trust in bitcoin. (but now i sold, lol)

Hi :P
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:44:04
Here you can see the transaction fees required at the moment:

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:26:00
Try to add your transaction at the moment the clock reaches XX:00. So exactly at the full hour. That's the time they reset and they accept new transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:15:08
You can try to add your transaction ID to this transaction accelerator. 
They accept 100 new transactions every full hour. (so when the clock reaches 1:00 / 2:00 / 3:00 etc. Be quick, cause usually those 100 are filled quick. 
Good luck.

Only the sun is for free in life. 
And even than you get some clouds in front of it sometimes.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:03:49
Check this site: 
There you cans see which transactions are confirming, it's based on: the higher the fee of the transaction, the faster they confirm. So if you know the fee of your transaction you can use that site to see when yours will confirm.
A lot of transactions at the moment, so if your fee is low it will take some time.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:19:32
There are a lot of transactions at the moment. More than the netwerk can handle at the moment. So they are building up.
Transactions are confirmed in this way: the higher the transaction fee, the quicker they get confirmed.
Here you can see which transactions are confirmed now:
On the left you see the fee in satoshi/byte.
So if you know the fee you paid you can predict when your transaction will get confirmed. At busy moments like this it can take a while....
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:09:33

I see no difference with the times a BTC was worth $1.
If you invest more, you get (dollar wise) more profit. The price of the BTC doesn't matter to that.
So stop crying and start investing. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:46:40
Oh and at this site you can see which transactions with which fee are conforming now: 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:42:19
The fee per byte is low (4 sat/byte). Which you can see here: 
So it will take some time to confirm. At this site you cans see which transaction are confirming now with which fee:
So i'm afraid you have to be patient before you transaction gets confirmed, next time add a bit more fee.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:51:58
21 satoshi/byte transaction fee.
Here you can see which transactions are confirming now:
So your transaction is in the green layer, so you have to be patient. ;)
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:01:22
I added your transaction to the ViaBTC transaction accelerator.
So when they find a block your transaction will get confirmed.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:57:53
You can buy 0,00001 BTC or even a smaller amount. There is no difference.
If the prices rices 20%. The money you invested will also rices with 20%. No matter how much you invested. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:49:24
All you need is the private key of your bitcoins to control them. (and to control the future fork coins)
When they are on your electrum wallet you have acces to it.
When they are on an exchange you don't have acces to it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:46:33
Depends on your window. ;)

We don't need threads every time complaining about the all time high treads.Shit got annoying.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:05:07
You can try to add your transaction to this transaction accelerator: 
They accept 100 transactions an hour, so try to add your transaction on exactly XX:00 hour.
If your transaction get accepted it will be confirmed when ViaBTC mines a block.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:36:13
Do you have a transaction ID? So we can look it up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:30:42
So time to sell and buy at the bottom of the dip. Easy money, thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:45:18
Confirmations are faster than ever.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:33:12
At the moment the mempool (the pool of waiting transactions) is empty. So at the moment there is no reason to complain about fees.
But it varies, a few days ago there were a lot of transactions waiting for confirmation. So the fees (to get a fast conformation were higher).
Check this site where you can see the amount of waiting transactions on the mempool: 
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:08:32
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:31:17
You didn't lost it. But it can take a while before your transaction gets confirmed. As you can see here:  5 satoshi fee transactions did confirm in the past 2 days.
So i guess this will also happen in the future. You just have to be a bit patient. ;)
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:53:11
$330 :D
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:23:38
Your transaction has a fee of 5 satoshi. That is a bit low.
Transactions with a high fee are accepted faster.
On this site you can see the waiting transactions and which fee they have: 
As you can see, it's going to take a while before your transaction will get through.
You can try to add your transaction to this transaction accelerator: 
They accept 100 transactions an hour. So be ready to add your transaction at XX:00 time otherwise the 100 transaction limit is reached.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:18:09
I believe you are stupid, or a troll. Have a good day.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:16:37
If you have found a better place to invest that $1500 which gives you more than 30% profit, please let me know.

The site seems offline, another good site to follow the signaling of bip91 is: 
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:37:58
You can look for yourself on this site:
If they did add 133 sat/byte fee the transaction will be confirmed when the purple part is gone. So yes it may take a while.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:18:13
They just did!
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:09:10
