Don't worry he will be here soon.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:51:16
Yeah I hope so haha thanks!

Is there anyway you guys can verify an account faster, Im reading that It takes much longer than the 48 hour period you guys state on your website.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:48:30
Yeah I know, the problem is When buying Bitcoin on Kraken the difference is around $20 when compared to buying on Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:12:55
I fixed that problem now its saying insufficient documentation?
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:53:29
Also sorry if this sounds like a stupid question but what is the margin option on your website, sorry I am new to trading in general and would like to know.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:05:39
Would definitely be a good buy, Would you rather spend $100 on something that will most likely increase in value, or spend it on something like clothing that loses it value over time?
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:45:14
Thank you I have missed out since it was like $3400 =( very sad.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:02:31
Thanks a lot!

Do you have to transfer over the Bitcoin or does it automatically do that?

I opened up an account on Gemini but it is taking forever for me to get verified, I just opened up a kraken account today and want to sign up for tier 3 but ive heard it takes a long time (similar to Gemini).

Is it still possible to transfer the USDT and transfer that over to fiat?
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:57:34
Ok thanks for letting me know!
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:00:10
Thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:24:03
to the wallet on Gemini then to Bittrex? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:58:45
Will this increase the price of bitcoin even more?
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:05:52
do you think Kraken would be a good alternative?
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:01:38
Now would be a good time, It will most likely go to $5000, then dip but again you can do whatever you like.

Coinbase - Link PayPal account - Have a drivers license and done.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:14:41
