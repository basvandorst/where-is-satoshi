Blockchain technology is the future, Bitcoin it's just the first coin that uses that technology.Its obvious that you will not make a lot of money from Bitcoin right now.

If you looking for quick buck you can make much more trading alt coins if you looking to support this idea of decentralized economy long term then investing in Bitcoin and ethereum makes perfect sense but its not all about the money for me, I would just invest 500$ in eth and i wouldn't care if i loose it all, i would be just  happy that i was part of this thing.The best part about cryptos isn't the money but the technology behind it.

Your life people worth more than all the money of the world, let's not forget that.Sure having 50m in my bank account would be fun but being alive is even more awesome, i see money as a tool to buy things and money if you ask me can't buy happiness.Im sure with the mindset your brother had he wouldn't be happy with all  his money after a while.To enjoy your money you must be happy now, don't whait money to make you happy because it will not in the long run.Im sorry for your loss.

I don't know anyone could get you 500.000 in cash for Bitcoin and if they would the taxes will eat a lot of that, better to keep it and you can rent a house with that.Bitcoin will not be crashing any time soon,its the future.
