When you deleted your account, what was the procedure? When you create a support ticket to delete your account, do they go through with it straight away or communicate with you first? How did you get your holdings, do they allow withdrawal or just ask for addresses to send coins to? Any answers are appreciated

Their last update states that users would be able to withdraw their funds if they wanted to discontinue use of the service considering the massive overhauls of the website, policy, management etc.  
They lied
They are denying people the ability to withdraw their own funds unless they give over personal information to the company, a random third party that pulls dodgy stunts like freezing peoples money en masse  
Doesnt really inspire confidence in the company, doesnt really make me feel like my personal information will be handled correctly.   
Denying the choice of the user to be able to leave when they want is all you need to know about poloniex

Just to clarify \- you need to go through KYC to unlock your profile and continue trading. 
On their own T&amp;C, they state that an account closure will allow you 90 days buffer to withdraw your holdings.
Close account citing disagreement with T&amp;C \&gt; get your coins that you will not be using to trade on their platform

If a large share of users dont go through with the KYC and instead choose to delete their accounts, they shouldnt be able to just "confiscate" \(steal\) those users funds  
Disagree with the T&amp;C
Disagree with the KYC
Dont trust the reputation of the company
Just want to delete the account and leave with your property.
