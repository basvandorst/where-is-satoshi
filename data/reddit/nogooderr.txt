If one is gifted enough to hack NSA, surely they're gifted enough to ask for less then 1 million BTC
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:54:19
If bitcoin was to become a global currency, what stops people from creating scams and viruses everywhere? After all the bitcoin must be on your computer if you want to send them fast.
@_date: 2016-04-15 22:42:40
As long as bitcoin has a "intrinstic" value in the black market, I believe it's deflationary nature will solve the rest.
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2016-08-16 03:52:13
I guess not
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:58:55
sorry for ur loss man 
@_date: 2016-04-17 20:01:44
It kinda does, yea
@_date: 2016-04-19 01:51:15
Yea, why aren't they mining larger blocks?
@_date: 2016-04-22 18:02:23
Good, let the bear flow through you.
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:25:49
What I wonder is what would be the most effective way to launder the gains? 
@_date: 2016-04-30 18:35:19
He paid fee though? or am I missing something?
@_date: 2016-04-19 01:33:41
What does this exactly mean?
@_date: 2016-04-17 20:00:53
I see you guys at $30k/coin
@_date: 2016-04-19 02:09:12
So you can have more transactions right? Or is there a limit to how big blocks you can get out of it?
@_date: 2016-04-27 13:33:17
Great dream!
@_date: 2016-04-07 00:39:47
Can anyone explain why it would matter if it were centralized?
@_date: 2016-04-27 11:02:51
So you can sell the shares at any time or how does that work?
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:18:25
This is what I'm waiting for. 
I hope it won't disappoint
@_date: 2016-04-27 21:27:55
I'm still waiting for something that can tie an address to a name. So you know who you paying and you know who you receive from without them telling.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:08:54
I would say $8m/btc.
You must account for all the lost coins, physical cash in the world, gold, stocks, bonds, real estate, saving and checkings accounts and also other derivate options

Wouldn't it be possible to invest in it with BTC? So say you invest 1 BTC and the company's value rises 10 times as much, you'd be worth 10 BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:45:10
lol, they are hacked right?
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:46:19
At what number was this one 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:07:02
This is bearish right? for bitcoin that is
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:38:40
Is this necessary or can i keep coins in cold storage?
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:25:18
LMAO, why is this not upvoted
@_date: 2016-04-17 14:53:41
This would be true IF all miners sold all their coins immidiately.
But I'm pretty sure most miners hoard their coins. That's why a halvening won't make a difference. The only reason it would make a difference is because of the decreased inflation, it'd would have a higher value as a currency and as a "storage asset"

Does he still believe we'll reach $1mil before end of 2020?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:42:13
True but it could be something that he had a buy entry on $67 and it only got down to $68 or something and then never got another good entry
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:20:12
Bitcoin X sells for $0.06 and you get 10,000 for each bitcoin? so $600 for each bitcoin technically? Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:37:56
It's still likely to go up a lot so and not as a risky investment as it was before so you could invest more with same risk appetite and sork of get the same returns anyway
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:01:36
Compound interest will make interest on the interest you've already gained.
So 20% of $1,500 is $300 for the first week then 20% of $1,800 is $360 and so on

Shorting a deflationary hyped up asset like bitcoin now would be stupid. It's becoming clearer that it's here to stay.
I think the smart and big money will be buying up bitcoin and not shorting it

What will you do with the $0.0054 that you earned in profit?
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:05:45
Can you elaborate on that?
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:57:28
Imagine there are 10 people who each holds 1 apple each.
Each apple is currently worth $10k(last trading price). The market cap is $100k
9 people have an asking price of $100k.
1 person is willing to sell his apple for $80k and finds a seller.
Now the market cap is $800k even though just $80k was spent
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:01:07

That's like going into a car dealership and paying $20k for a $40k car because that's what it will be worth 2 years from now

Got myself a new mansion, nothing to see here boys! :)
Move along!
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:59:38
LOL nice
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:00:44
Very few people are using bitcoin to buy right now
What matters is how much a coffee would cost in 50 years and onwards
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:28:45
You sir, make no sense
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:54:29
Wow, this looks great! Looking forward to this!
When are you anticipating a release date? What is the IP?
500 bits
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:25:56
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:36:56
I must ask, if bitcoin were to ever die out, when do you reckon it would happen and how?? (taking technical fails and broken protocol out of the picture)
@_date: 2014-10-31 22:03:33
No, it's not huge...
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:52:58
Keep telling yourself that. Anybody under the age of 30 is almost guaranteed to witness the fall of the dollar
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:56:27
lol nice :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:05:31
Let's say there are 1 bid at $350 and 1 ask at $351
If you wanna sell, you could put an ask at $350.99 (this way, you are the one who is selling bitcoins for the cheapest price avaible, you could also place it higher but then there are people who's selling for cheaper in front of you)
OR if you wanna sell immidiately you can just sell into the bid orders, IE $350
@_date: 2014-10-04 11:57:33
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:40:49
Lol wow.
I ain't even mad, that's some dedication right there to stop users from adopting to bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:02:21
Of course lol,
Nobody has argued with that
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:45:11
Lol, you don't have money in your changetip account then, it collects automatically for me
And I only use my money in changetip account to tip it forward too as it's usually a too small amount to care for
@_date: 2014-10-18 11:56:37
Bubbles are the nature of the beast
Remember this is a global technological phenomenon, larger then internet.
Price discovery will be bumpy, simple as that.
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:13:07
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:31:27
So this is built on bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:00:39
What happens when you need to send coins from your computer to your offline laptop though? Then you will very much need an address

@_date: 2014-10-07 14:29:51
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:09:41
Alright, sell your bitcoins then
@_date: 2014-11-28 02:47:24
Of course it can fail
Bitcoin is no guarantee to riches
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:57:26
I don't know but I remember that date. Could of been a troll though
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:21:44
Well the price is gonna go up of course
Ultimately we might be at $1million/btc and a XBT will be the same purshasnig power as a dollar (ie a coffee will cost 1-2 xbt)
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:30:53
Too clumsy, needs to be easier
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:12:40
Right so if this better technology never comes, you think there is no chance of failure?
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:30:41
LOL $20
We got an early adopter here!
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:09:37
Isn't this a bullish thing though?
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:31:34
That's definately one of the better criticism bitcoin has received but I don't think it's too much of a worry
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:03:25
probably around 3 trillion bits
@_date: 2014-12-08 10:37:12

@_date: 2014-11-02 14:18:30
yes, thanks :)
Hard to see what links are dodgy though
@_date: 2014-11-02 07:36:27
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:59:27
If all it takes is to scan a QR-code, we might aswell have no numbers at all
@_date: 2014-11-20 12:23:14
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:07:10
What? you're playing??
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:28:44
All these people, even in the bitcoin reddit saying we will not reach $1mil actually makes me think that we just might.
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:09:40
We've heard this one too many times
Nothing is gonna happen, believe me
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:47:02
Alright, avast isn't picking up anything atleast
So it should be safe right?
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:25:38
Great so we're back where we were at 10 days ago...
Still 50% lower then 15th november though
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:03:26
I like it
@_date: 2014-11-02 10:01:31
Nice scam site doe!
Is there any way of getting a virus by just clicking on the link?
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:16:48
That like-to-dislike ratio though
@_date: 2014-11-04 12:56:41
These "bit" numbers will become more relevant in the future
For the meanwhile we can just say 153.5k bits
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:59:45
IMO a website that stores peoples bitcoins safely without any hassle and that has easy-to-use features only avaible for bitcoin.
A little bit like a bank I guess.
I think a real killerapp for bitcoin would be if you could tie names to private addresses so when somebody search for your name and send bitcoin to it, it will automatically send it to your public address without it ever being exposed
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:05:27
Those are early and invite many friends will be making money I guess. (if it becomes big that is)
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:21:07
LMAO, I love how this guy makes nothing but bitcoin videos these days
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:35:03
bix, i like that word

That is a genius app doe
@_date: 2014-10-31 10:40:20
LMAO, there is no way that is true
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:57:46
Oh, bitcoin is dead again?? :D
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:27:25
Plan A!
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:26:07
I don't understand though, isn't the counterparty thing supposed to be embedded in the bitcoin protocol?? 
So why is there a need for counterparty shares?
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:51:12
Wow, reading this, it's clear to me that fees have to increase by alot
We're probably gonna be looking at $0.5-$1 fees in the future which kinda is too much
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:52:56

And I need it now

@_date: 2014-10-07 01:13:14
counterparty pump coming??

100 bits
@_date: 2014-12-20 18:03:35
He'll be in jail while his bitcoins are making him millions of dollars
Cmon, he don't have it that bad :D
BTW, did he stop paying lawyers? I know in one interview, he said he spent thousands on lawyers every day to make sure to not go to jail. What happend with that?
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:40:54
I don't see it
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:34:10
Pretty much, which is why I said I would wait for a better protocol/coin
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:13:17
I'd probably wait for a better coin but if I couldn't, I'd choose litecoin. I'm a very anti-litecoin guy though.
Maybe a bit in bitshares, monero and counterparty too
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:31:02
True true!
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:25:25
The catch is that bitcoin isn't a "thing"
It's money. And people prefer to have a lot of money
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:35:03
It's normal human psychology that most people do feel richer.

Except that in the future we probably won't measure value in dollars...
if you know what I mean ;)
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:05:04
Because paper currencies will fail, sooner or later.
That's why it's nececssary
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:38:36
you will see on the right side how many bitcoins are bought/sold for what price
@_date: 2014-10-09 05:12:21
I will probably hold till $0
Maybe would consider selling my stash if it were to go sub $150 but it depends

I thought we were gonna switch to bits(1,000,000 bits = 1 bitcoin) on the 31st of october??
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:37:29
right so it starts in 3hours 20 min then?
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:24:20
That proves it.
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:28:28
Please explain further
I cannot see how QR code would help you in any way in this situation
@_date: 2014-10-20 21:06:37
Definately a sign! :D
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:23:04
LOL, stronk!
@_date: 2014-11-16 04:35:19
Don't tip useless 100 bits to everybody who comments
Tip people, whose comments you like and tip them with a bigger amount instead
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:56:47
That was awkward lol
@_date: 2014-10-21 00:21:06
We are still in the speculation phase
If people are using it now or not, honestly don't matter
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:56:37
But then again it will never become mainstream, nor a currency if people don't hold it waiting for the price to go up
So what do we got here? Useless numbers?
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:26:27
I think you're overanalyzing it
My theory is that he's a paid shill that is reading off a anagram or whatever it's called and is laughing because he knows that it's all bullshit :D
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:30:51
Shouldn't your gmail account have all keys??
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:03:14
Somebody should put up a bitcoin poster beside which say
"0.01€ for a money transfer within the world"
It would look so bizarre lol
@_date: 2014-12-06 11:03:54
So if you didn't have teamviewer running that night, you'd still have your btc?
@_date: 2014-12-06 12:57:31
I was referring to this part: "I realized that Bitcoin does not yet have a market as large as other currency."
If people are this ignorant, then it's no wonder people are complaining about the volatility. It seems people actually expected bitcoins to go from 0 to 100 in a day (the day it was created)
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:50:27
This is why the price dropped???
My leveraged long order got margin called because of these fucking assholes
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:15:24
TLDR: Buy counterparty tokens??
Counterparty pump coming??
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:00:40
Freeroll rescheduled... great... :|
@_date: 2014-11-15 06:34:05
Gamble and win more bitcoins of course
Maybe they could add customizable avatars for a small sum of XBT too
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:38:40
how long have you been pumping goldcoin for??
it isn't going anywhere...
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:16:29
I can't find it?? Where do I play it
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:51:05
pretty much, yea
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:35:16
It's not a fucking pipe dream
It's not looking very bright right now but you're not very bright either if you think $5k is impossible 2015. You're not getting the prootcol if you do think so.
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:23:37
lol u serious??
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:21:42
LOL there was a thread about that guy yesterday too
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:12:17
Probably 10 times
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:05:06
1 bits
(this is just a test)
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:30:35
It's DEFINATELY a scam
You might be able to put 0.5 and get 1 btc back but that is only so that you should put more into it
I'd say it's not worth to bother with
@_date: 2014-10-27 04:35:54
I guess the difference is that feathercoin was a GRQ scheme
Nobody in their right mind would buy feathercoin for any other reason then to make money

Thanks man, will tip some forward :D
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:55:06

Now we can all be wealthy assholes! Sweet!

@_date: 2014-11-02 14:19:38
Kinda, but I sold a bit of my stash so I'll be happy when price is going down
Felt the same way back in 2013 summer when price was $60-$70 though
@_date: 2014-10-16 19:32:41
The most crazy things are yet to happend I think so i'd say you haven't missed much
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:52:01
Well, is it not risky to make changes in the core?
@_date: 2014-10-20 10:51:50
What this chart could mean is that we are slightly overvalued
July 11, price peaked at $30 and 20k addresses were used. Now 180k addresses are used
So maybe the current value of bitcoin is $270?
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:57:55
This is gentlemen...
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:23:19
I played a playmoney tourny on pokerstars a couple hours ago.
The buy in was 10K and ended up winning like 600k in second place (about 150 players)
Hopefully I will be as lucky as then :p
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:14:34
@_date: 2014-10-23 06:35:39
So what was the passphrase?
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:45:26
Buying when bitcoin price is really low as opposed to buying when high??
That doesn't make alot of sense
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:02:50
To the moon! :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:42:00
Yes, I still own the house but I would like to place the bed even though it don't matter that much. I was mostly curious
BTW, there are barely any animals at all so it's really hard to get food/wool, do you plan to change this? And also there is no way to change house right?
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:34:28
lol :)
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:00:02
TL:DR - buy counterparty shares?
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:18:48
Just log in to your gmail account?
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:35:48
YES of course lol
If that isn't the case, you gotta be fucking retarded to buy gold, if not for speculative purposes/store of value
I know there are plenty of people who hedge against fiat by buying gold. I guess it must be the less smarter category of people who do that...
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:19:02
They want to "ensure greater transparency and security and simplicty"
nigga, ain't that exactly what bitcoin strives to do? Fuck...
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:58:04
The blockchain don't work without bitcoin though, right?
So how does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:01:21
I don't but I know that this isn't something that will attract the mainstream. (it's the thing that you have to send BTC to the phone address first that is in the way. Sending bitcoin to your phone and THEN to the receiver is a turn off)
I've always had the idea that one could tie a username to a private key so you can search for that name and send btc instead of writing the whole public address though
@_date: 2014-10-06 06:42:15
Another shitcoin pump? ugh... lol
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:24:01
yea cuz it's so practical to walk into the store and be like: 
- 1 coffee please!
- Sure! Because of the discount we have today 1 coffee is only zero point zero zero zero zero zero five eighty six bitcoin while it's usually zero point zero zero zero zero zero six eight nine
- So is that 5 zero's or 6 zero's?
- That's 5 zero's sir; zero point zero zero zero zero zero five eighty six
- But now you said 6 zero's????
you can see that it's not very practical

I think it could die out naturally if price never would rise
@_date: 2014-10-31 10:35:01
Wow, everything is looking so bullish, yet the price just keeps going down
It does not make any sense at all

Mayweather said he was planning to retire a pretty long time ago, didn't he? I think he did. I reckon he ain't got the sport in him anymore.
I still think he has solid chance to win because he's still a damn good boxer. Anyone know where I can watch it btw?

You're hypying it up too much.
Changetip, while it obviously has potential, is still flawed imo. Mostly in the way that you need to send money to your changetip account first. It needs to be simpler! It needs to be as simple as the mind can comprehend.
I'm still hopeful though.

It's not gonna raise prices on other exchanges. The volume was probably very low compared to the biggest exchanges and so it has no impact. If anything it's gonna fall sharply on the south african exchange (not sure what the price is now)

The bitcoin value has very much to do with its usefulness.
Not everybody can seamlessly convert from USD to BTC and vice versa in an instant.
Which is what you need to do to take care of volatility and if it was possible the price would obviously would be very low because there's no need for bitcoin, the currency, at all. 
Do I have to say that the price is $233? Meaning you're wrong...

So what is the chance of finding a collision if everybody in the world would use bitcoin and creating new addresses for each transaction.

I've read USB sticks have a lifespan of 5-10 years?
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:36:45
The thing is that governments know how to make it userfriendly and easy. These dense fucking crypto nerds on this forums have no clue about the importance of that. So it is very possible that government coins take over.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:06:34
Ah, nice but it's still possible to get it right?
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:51:42
That's an awesome meme lol
Sucks though
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:08:55
People who's not so familiar with bitcoin throwing away their lifw savings in fees but this is fine right? You dense fucks.
@_date: 2016-06-11 23:51:22
Cheers gentlemen!
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:10:48
It HAS store of value because of it's currency uses. If bitcoin cannot be used as a currency than it is useless. And yes, I know that the majority of bitcoins value comes from storing it at the moment.
@_date: 2016-06-05 12:08:25
You mean because of banks loaning out money they don't have?
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:56:18
You'd be a bigger idiot if you found $1000 or a diamomd and didnt pick it up
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:52:52
That they're losing money to help poor people
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:53:55
Ah, I see. Well to prevent that you could just send a smaller amount to  the address first and let it sit there for a few months and see if it's been taken.
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:03:37
Nah, I was referring to shops that sells coffee for example.
There's been some discussion regarding waiting 5-30 mins for just buying a coffee but they can just sweep the private key to the address which the payment was sent to it and have it immidiately no?
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:45:47
Why was the transaction rejected in the first place?
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:41:09
Interesting... To me it seems like the majority will quickly choose one of the chains and the value difference will just grow bigger between the chains as time goes by.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:33:32
So would you say it's a good idea to invest in theirs?
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:50:09
But with traditional payments you can send $10 to an empty account and then spend it right away right?
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:57:16
There wasn't enough buyers?
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:06:24
lmao that's exactly what I was thinking
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:39:22
LMAO, welcome to the fucking SHOW!
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:33:42
It's a lot more time between the ATH this time however.
You should account for that
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:24:07
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:42:05
So what's the point of it all? The new system makes it cheaper and faster right? The governments won't be interested in decentralization if they can control it themselves, I'm pretty sure. So if it's real I'd pay attention to it. I'm not very knowledgeable on the technology aspect of crypto currencies so I don't know if it would work.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:50:44
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:49:24
How does that make sense though? Should have a longer lifespan when it's just laying around in some safe space free from dust and dirt.

How the fuck is it spam?
@_date: 2016-06-20 02:47:00
That is true if every miner sells all their coins as soon as they get them.
Which is pretty unlikely. Most of them probably hold.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:08:55
Yea hopefully it will work as intended.
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:17:04
And why is that? To make money?
Bitcoin price could not rise much without scaling. You gotta be incredibly stupid to think 1MB block is a good idea. Or an extremist libertarian. But it's kinda the same thing.
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:38:50
Because bitcoin is still highly speculative.
It's gonna take some time before it becomes a solid asset.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:49:16
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:15:33
Well if it was that easy kid, everyone would be billionaires.
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:01:25
You smart! I appreciate that
@_date: 2016-06-24 19:43:40
The difference between buying at $400 and $660 would be about 65% more profits
That means if you invest $100k at $400 you would have $1mil at $4000 where as you would only have $600k if you would bought at $660
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:15:40
Rich shibe
@_date: 2016-06-09 10:43:59
So you send bitcoins to a name instead of a public address?
@_date: 2016-06-17 10:40:19
Last time I tried it, I had to wait for first confirmation though. But I guess it depends on wallets.
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:20:26

No, I highly doubt it.
More likely that it goes to $5k

@_date: 2016-06-13 22:00:01
Not neccessarily.
If it has reached a high enough price then other people will realize it has value. Afterall if it did not have value, why would china buy all of it up?
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:33:19
Never go full retard.
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:30:51
Yes I see, so what is stopping vendors from sweeping the private keys after somebody has bought something? Must be some way to automate that. That way they don't have to wait for confirmations.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:07:49
Because they can't make it secure by mining right?
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:40:41
I guess he means it's not a big threat as of present times.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:48:19

@_date: 2016-06-13 16:11:32
Bitcoin is called honey badger sometimes.
It's an animal that basically don't give a single fuck, has no fear and do whatever it wants to do
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:21:32
I see, I only watched youtube clip.
But if the fees are extremely low because it's offchain, isn't that pretty bad for the network as a whole then?
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:41:52
alright then
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:34:16
Exactly lol, completely useless. When I saw the 647 number I thought it was gonna say that he had saved $647 using bitcoin but nope.
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:49:54
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:20:19
Electrum and save the wallet files and remember password.
And if you don't wanna do that or have bad memory or whatever, then save the seed but make sure nobody can see it.

You mean willy the bot?
If that theory was true, somebody would make another one of those bots and everyone invested in bitcoin would be billionaires. It doesn't work like that though.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:38:47
It adds a confirmation for each block that gets mined and a block gets mined around every 10 minutes.
But it doesn't matter how many confirmations you have. If it's more than 6 confirmations it has no relevance
The reason it says transacting 16 btc is because you probably had 16 btc in your wallet. And when you send 0.041 the other balance will go to a new address but in the same wallet, it's so it doesn't use the same address twice which some wallets do.
@_date: 2018-10-23 08:46:53
What did he say?
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:07:33
lol good one
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:30:47
LMAO awesome
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:44:40
That is true if miners are the only sellers on the market, assuming they sell as soon as they get the coins which is probably not the case. Most of them probably hold.
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:54:21

@_date: 2017-08-09 20:47:15
You wake up from everything you thought was true?
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:32:49
The thing is to be calm.
Let's say the price would crash from 4000 to 3000 and instead of selling it can be a good idea to wait and if the price crashes to 2000 it may have a retracement to 2800 and sell at that point instead.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:35:27
I look at blockchain.info and blocks are still coming in with 10 minutes interval. What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:43:01
In this case, wouldn't people just start buying? As the price is sort of artificially dumped.

Be ready for a fun ride but stay calm and focused is my tip.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:39:00
Yea but I think governments could make their coin much more easily accessible, more userfriendly, safer and easier in general to use.
Bitcoin people have close to zero interest in this.
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:45:39
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:48:35
You are referring to this? 
@_date: 2016-06-26 19:20:39
IDK about that lmao
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:03:53
Now how can I securely store my bitcoins, is it safe at all? This is why banks is still needed..
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:18:50
Wow damn, wish it was me lol.
What is that, 2k btc?
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:31:51
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:04:48
There is no number
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:50:37
For all that say his fee is low, it says his fee is 0.0002 BTC no??
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:06:27
Nah, there could be some sort of message stating Name, address and/or phone number or something before confirming the transaction to prevent that.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:42:35
What is this paper and can I subscribe to it somehow?
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:08:40
Yup, we're definitely going higher

HODL is typically said when price is tanking.
If you wanna sell at a loss, go ahead.
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:34:47
I will definitely buy one too.
Heck I might buy 2.
As long as the fit and material is good ;)
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:57:02
That's what greed is.
Should of invested in BTC
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:55:26
I was more interested in subscribing for it for news in stocks and other political events that could affect currencies/stocks
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:56:57
This is what I was wondering too.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:55:25
I dont think there will be a big dip yet but you might get in around 3600-3800
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:23:42
LOL I lost it at the dollar
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:31:50
So when do we get bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:42:04
Let's say you have a ROI at 3% per month. In that case it will become much cheaper if you pay it of slowly rather than an instant 1 time payment as you get additional return on that one time payment that you didn't pay
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:15:13
Alright thanks
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:23:33
Your post seemed to(to me) impliy that you think only the wealthier should be customed to using bitcoin.
Also I think fees between $0.05-0.10 are perfect.
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:54:18
In order for there to be a buyer there has to be a seller too and vice versa.
If there are no sellers or buyers then there is no price. It may have value but there won't be no price until there's atleast one of each parties willing to trade. In which case the price becomes whatever the successful trade was sold for.
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:00:14

You could still do that before the fork though?
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:04:47
There will come a time when there is no crash anymore and the traders will fail miserably while those who hold will glide out in the sunset

My prediction late 2015 for 2016 was that it would be a pretty calm year reaching prices of 650-800 at most. 
If you're curious for my 2017 prediction, I believe it's gonna be a big year, probably first quarter too. So strap in.

In short bitcoin is a deflationary asset in a very inflationary world, just like gold. It is also a protocol in which a whole new economy system can be built upon as opposed to the somewhat broken financial system in place today.

I would suggest you read what I said in the previous post a few times to really understand it. I appreciate you not trying to be a dick, I'm not either and I'm not gonna argue more after this.
I will just touch on the deflationary nature of bitcoin as that seems to be your main point. The difference between bitcoin and something like fixed shares is that fixed shares is a useless deflationary asset while bitcoin is a proper deflationary asset BECAUSE of it's attributes. If the fixed stocks would have the same attributes, it would of had the same price discovery that bitcoin has had. And if it wasn't for bitcoins attributes, it would indeed be another useless deflationary asset.

If the pool makes a 51% attack or not doesn't matter. What matters is that they CAN do it. Similarily, the government don't co-operate with the Rockefellers because they might crash the economy. They are co-operating with them because they CAN crash the economy. Even if that is never gonna happen.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:12:40
No it's not ridicolous. It'll be in anybodys interest who can afford it to destroy it and create another similar thing that they can control and make a boat load of money longterm. Also regarding the last lines, I included the "not cryptocurrency in general" specifically not to receive these kind of replies. He never pointed out flaws in future cryptocurrencies, only the current cryptocurrencies.

@_date: 2015-08-15 17:38:45
Except he does. He's just pointing out the flaws and states that specifically bitcoin (not cryptocurrency in general) is probably not gonna play a major role in the finanical department in the future, because of those flaws. But if I have understand correctly, all of those issues can be fixed? Atleast the most important of issues.

First off, bitcoin definitely has intrinsic value; Divisible, scarce, easy to use commodity that can be sent across the world with minimal fees, it's decentralized and free from banks and states allowing banking for third world countries where there is none, it has transparency which allows for much more effective charity among other uses, it's a protocol in which a economy system can be built on as I said before. I like to compare it to airplanes, when airplanes was first built nobody would imagine you fly big tubes with hundreds of people in them. Same thing will happen with bitcoin. It can be used anonomosuly to buy drugs and weapons (If that is good or bad is irrelevant, it is still valued).
 On top of that because of these values, it will also be seen a deflationary safe haven unless something better comes along but that is unlikely because bitcoin is good enough and because of it's fully technological and digital attributes it can be adjusted as time goes on.
 So that was the first thing, secondly the dollar also has less intrinsic value than beanie babies but without the dollar the world would collapse so that is a terrible argument
What do you mean, you can't trade, sell or buy things with bitcoin? Of course you can.
As for the duplicates, if fake dollar bills was legal, do you think people would still use them? The answer is no because people agree to something so that it has actual value. I have no good answer to this but if you look at the world, that's just how it is.

@_date: 2015-07-15 20:13:29
I think he makes a point with the fact that a self levitating or self fulfilling currency could be a bit problematic but there's also no reason behind why it woulnd't work. And if it works, it's gonna be massively great.

Me and the squad after that recovery 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:28:20
Coinbase have 2 out of 3 vault right?
So as long as you have both and coinbase only have 1, you do have complete control of it.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:43:20
Because of all the people that sold at $2 when it was really high but then it just kept going to $5800
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:40:04
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:38:27
Were you skeptic at $100?
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:46:29
Yes they did

20th september
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:43:30
That's my point. The economy looks better than ever because of these factors. There's more money in the system than there ever has been. And that's where the "money flooding into bitcoin" will come from
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:36:01
Steady climbin!
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:45:01
Yes but china is panic selling.
If it was clear that it was only ICOs that was getting banned in china, they would sell ETH and not BTC
@_date: 2018-07-04 20:44:07

Will this fork be the same as BCC fork? Will you need to transfer your coins from exchange to wallet and then you send them back after and you can claim the new segwit2x coins with the same private keys?
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:44:45
That kid had hooked up and rich parents tho I assume?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:35:15
How sure can we be of that it's only ICOs?
Would china really panic sell if it was only ICOs?
@_date: 2018-07-14 21:14:52
It's the stealth phase
@_date: 2018-07-21 18:21:29
Try 80x
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:34:59
How about debt?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:31:32
The economy looks better than ever, what you talking about?
@_date: 2019-09-17 00:38:46
This is actually a drop chop top with a diggly doo pattern. It means its setting up for a kangaroo leg and foot pattern which is potentially bullish.
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:29:16
Day traders may have done well for the past few years but there will come a time when they will fail miserably in the bitcoin market
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:33:43
How do you split your coins? Same as with BCC?
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:59:54
What is that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:38:20
That depends on if the person has $10,000 million already or just $1 dollar.
You're not gonna make a yearly return of 100,000% in bitcoin every year, you're just not. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:05:23
With massive retail adoption, we'd rather be looking at something like $2mil/btc
@_date: 2015-04-05 13:11:25

What is this
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:51:47
It's an airdrop? What does that mean? What do I need to do to claim S2X coins? I still haven't claimeed my BCC yet...
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:03:45
Are you selling? How many coins you've got?
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:39:33
Could of made a big fortune though if he had a bigger fortune
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:09:31
What about if you go on a shopping spree and buy like $300 worth of groceries, waiting 10 minutes is obviously not convenient

@_date: 2018-04-25 12:51:29
That is nice but seems pretty lonely
@_date: 2016-10-02 17:49:31
Is onecoin even used for anything at all other than "making money"?
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:23:08
Right but would you do that voluntarily? That's what he means.
It costs money to produce a bitcoin, that is its proof of work
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:03:51
You're underestimating bitcoins deflationry nature then. Big time. At this point of time, bitcoin doesn't hvae much utility

Well I didn't see it. It was my mother that mentioned it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:03:35
I been in btc since april 2013. My advice would be to hold on a bit longer. I think price is at its worst point right now. But anything can happen of course

Moral of the story: Don't buy shitcoins.
Also, sell ETH while you still can
@_date: 2015-11-19 17:00:48
So does bitcoin become untracable then?

@_date: 2015-03-04 16:23:33
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:05:30
It's easy to sell. Most of us here are expecting a lot higher price for bitcoin which is why they hold. Selling at tops and re-buying lower can be tricky.
@_date: 2016-05-27 18:05:12
The latter.
They are neccessary for average joes
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:41:55
Because ETH is overvalued. It is almost 50% of bitcoins share.
20% of bitcoins share, I can accept.
Bitcoin has been talked about for many years and nobody knows about ETH (ask on the street).
I'm not knowledgable about the techologial aspects of ETH however and my opinion is based on economics, dynamics and psychology.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:55:19
It's gonna crash to maybe $4k. I'm pretty sure we'll see $8k atleast though
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:27:58
Well he was talking about the theoretical upper limit but there is no limit as to how high it can go so I said 10m just so you can play with.
You will not see $1m in 2027. I could bet my life on that

LMFAO, best gif yet!
All it needs is this soundtrack 
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:17:22
That's just stupid. Bitcoin is a liquid asset.
Would you rather have $100 or $1?
Would you rather have 45 kg of gold or 5 kg of gold?
Assume it would be the same worth and most people would choose the former.
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:26:22
What's wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:29:05
Nope, not selling.
@_date: 2015-03-30 11:09:56
I recall him saying he spent few grand each day to stay out of jail.

What is this??
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:38:48
Is this real? lol
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:24:43
lol, I can relate to this
@_date: 2016-05-01 13:50:29
Yea, that's what I was saying which is why it's better to save the wallet file and remember the password.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:52:30
That doesnt mean that the price will crash
@_date: 2015-03-29 08:21:06

I would think so... but can't know for sure

It is.
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:03:03
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:27:27
What exactly is this?
Is it people giving money to other people who need it and then sort of get a "bonus" for doing it? And they can then get money back by someone doing the same?
@_date: 2015-10-14 00:54:41
And do I need to reload the blockchain or something?
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:33:48
If this isn't a glitch, $10k/XBT will be coming to you live in just a few weeks
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:40:21
So how do you make money? Ads?
@_date: 2016-05-01 22:40:47
Anyone have more ideas to obscure it?

@_date: 2016-05-01 03:44:43
It's better to just save the wallet file in case of HD crashes.
Seed phrase is for when you forget password. If someone finds your seed phrase, game over kid. Someone finds you wallet file, no problems.
@_date: 2016-05-16 22:45:15
@_date: 2015-03-22 23:28:51

Like a shark swimming around its prey
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:35:45
I think banks will still exist even in the presence of a hypothetical global decentralization of money.
The difference will be that people can take out their money, or in worst case scenario freeze them so the bank can't touch them, whenever they are not satisfied with the banks actions.
@_date: 2015-10-28 21:38:33
Like I predicted LMAO
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:58:19
You thought that bitcoin couldn't beat it. I was just stating that it already is, from a purely technological perspective of course.
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:25:01
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:26:07
There's plenty of us that has been absolutely certain that bitcoin was gonna do this well.
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:29:55
Yea, that's what I thought.
Pretty crazy that people actually think it's legit.
@_date: 2015-03-29 03:13:08
Which are those?
@_date: 2016-10-01 18:26:55
You can withdraw the tokens for real money I think
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:19:05
If this was true, everybody would be making money out of bitcoin, which simply isn't true. Ultimately, somebody has to lose money and who would voluntarily lose money just so somebody else can get it?
It's still a matter of subjective value.
Interesting thought though
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:30:43
lol ight.
And I guess lawyers are no guarantee to release either but he didn't really do any criminal, did he?
@_date: 2015-03-20 09:33:21
$40-50k+ imo
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:17:19
That's kinda like saying "Shit, do you mind taking this bitcoin instead of cash? It's gonna crash to the ground soon anyway so I rather get rid of it."
I understand your intentions were good though.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:31:25
Well most of his followers are probably pretty fucking clueless so you shouldn't overestimate it either.
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:03:16
The thing is it has to be a higher income for miners...
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:56:05
So in about 24 hours?
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:27:25
Is that true? lol
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:40:52
Good shit
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:42:15
It doesn't split tomorrow? Tomorrow is 31st of july.
It splits on tuesday right?
If you send bitcoins to a wallet where you control your private keys, you can claim both. So if you have 1 bitcoin for example and you send it to wallet, you can have 1 BTC and 1 BCC after fork
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:33:10
You have more bitcoin? 130 is quite a bit
@_date: 2016-05-09 22:38:55
lmao you just had to huh?
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:55:55
"Anybody with a currency background"? You mean an expert? Those get paid to tell what others want to hear.
It's typically outsiders who see things like these.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:29:02
Ah ok, so I will be able to get both BTC and BCC with electrum? 
I read this, thought it meant that you couldn't
"This means that
Electrum will reject block headers sent by Electrum server running
Bitcoin Cash, and that users will not be able to send and receive BCC
using Electrum."
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:26:01
170 tps? Are you serious? we have like 1 tps now.
So we'll basically need 170x more usage for bitcoin to even be useful?
@_date: 2016-10-01 17:03:23
If you was early in onecoin you could make a ton of money
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:38:26
@_date: 2015-03-15 04:00:55
And the bitcoin will still have the same value? I don't see why that would be simpler if so.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:51:22
Yes, thanks. There will be BCC wallets with seed import in the future so it shouldn't be a problem right.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:26:00
I've waited 3 days for a transaction with 0.25$ fee and it hasnt got one confirmation yet
@_date: 2015-03-15 19:10:34
It isn't oversecure.
It barely takes $100 million to take over 50% of the mining network
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:29:48
$1 for every 80 min, that's not bad at all to be honest
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:10:07
There was a bitcoin wallet app a while ago which had a built in peer-to-peer message system.
Not sure what it was called, but yes, bitcoin can already beat that.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:32:37
The market will balance by it's own I believe. Price is still dictated by supply and demand
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:05:56
I don't understand? You have to type 250 bit and not 250bit?
@_date: 2015-02-10 06:58:38
I understand that the money network effect is very strong but as long as people won't get pointed in what direction they should go to in terms of wallet choice and secure storage then a governmentmade coin could definately thrive by telling the average joe "go here, use this, do that"
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:49:21

LMAO is Craig Wright losing his fucking mind or what's going on?
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:26:31
I thought you couldn't use blockchain without bitcoin? What are they talking about? Can anyone explain?
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:43:38
Yes, thank you. I have private keys for paper wallet.
Do I just need to move them to wallet for 1st august then I can move then back to exchange?
@_date: 2015-03-15 04:01:50
It says billonS though
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:02:47
Should I be worried if I connected my lenovo laptop to internet only once to make a offline version of bitaddress.org?

I have some on paper wallet and some on bitstamp exchange

John McAfee is one of those crazy dudes that I usually take his word for but this one, IDK lol

What movie is this?
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:18:25
the demand will eventually largely decrease if price were to drop a lot.
Once the tipping point is reached for when bitcoin is not deceived as useful in any way anymore
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:49:38
Is it as useful, as safe and as easy to use as one could imagine?
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:33:34
It was something about the US and poker... I can't recall what it was but I thought it was that it was banned

What about bitstamp?
@_date: 2015-02-25 04:46:21
Has this to do with bitcoin or has it to do with poker though?
Poker has been banned in US for a while now...
(can't be arsed to read right now :D)
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:32:46
You kidding right? The amount of possibilities for private keys are something like 2^256 or something.
Anyway, good luck
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:01:48
Ah, I see. I misunderstood the post then :p
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:13:04
Yeah, I'm not from US but isn't poker classed as online gambling? Or it's only online casinos and such?
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:41:29
That would be the most bearish thing to happen.
Value would be $0 if that were to happen
@_date: 2016-07-13 10:10:32
1000 people who pays $0.1 fee is better then 10 people who pays $10 fee though.
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:07:29
Wow is this serious?
@_date: 2016-07-14 12:41:05
Are you saying that the more transactions a certain bitcoin has been in the more expensive it will be to send it?

That... or this 
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:33:10
Can you explain further how a paper system of bitcoin will dominate the crypto market? I have no idea what you mean
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:34:52
Why would it be a bad thing if it's centralized if transactions are much faster and cheaper though? It's not like they can take over right?
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:53:28
Exactly, no point in having 10 people pay $10 for a fee when you can have 1000 people paying $0.1 for a fee instead.
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:56:26
Define "everyone else"
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:34:53
Does anybody know when exactly is the split?
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:23:46
Litecoin lmao
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:27:40
Ah I see but when you send all those small payments as a large payment, all that past is "deleted" and it's small fees again for the next sender of those bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:30:19
It depends on how rich the people owning bitcoin are.
If Bill Gates were to invest all his worth into bitcoin under two months period time, you would possibly see $100k per BTC.
Assuming that more people are investing also as a result of the price increase, that is.

He specifically said "I will eat my dick on national TV"
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:49:53
Bitcoin will be a currency when it's ready to be a currency, don't worry.
It's definitiely not ready to be a currency yet, other than for drugs and weapons of course ;)
@_date: 2016-07-14 12:28:35
About 0.3% chance imo. Remember that the black market uses bitcoin and will continue to use bitcoin unless another altcoin takes over its place which probably won't be hard to see.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:40:32
No alcohol? I didn't sign up for this shit
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:56:05
Thanks, I guess I'll be fine. I've had them on there for 16 months now and they haven't been stolen yet
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:54:43
Well, if he really wanna spend his whole lifetime hoping to make a buck out of nothing, I ain't gonna stop him. I'm just recommending him not to.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:48:53
The wallet file for bitcoin core and electrum isn't the same
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:34:43
Not the watching wallet, the wallet that has the private keys of that wallet address.
Should be possible to withdraw with the private key too though so I don't know why that don't work.
@_date: 2016-07-02 12:50:18
But... But bitcoin doesn't need any banks.
How is it possible that you lost your money?
@_date: 2018-12-21 03:29:50
Somehow I doubt big companies will be on a fucking messaging app sending hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention the deflationary aspect and all technological aspets, but I don't know.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:15:29
How will they lose money?
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:35:54
Hmm, maybe. How did the price react to them growing older/dying.
Exponentially rising right?
@_date: 2016-07-09 11:32:19
8% inflation drops to 4% inflation
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:05:12
Wasn't the 2012 halving 10th december though?
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:18:42
How much did it lost, can you link a graph to it?
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:20:51
"Nothing is secure until its hacked "
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:03:22
I'd say the most important thing is not to convince people it's important. It's to make it easy and safe enough for average people. Plenty of time for that though.
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:58:52
Why you think that?
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:07:16
Yea something is definitely going on.
My guess is the big money have finally catched up and are doing everything they can to supress the price while buying up but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:31:55
Onecoin is not unstable like bitcoin though right? The price only goes up I believe?
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:28:13
So what does this mean? Is it unsafe to store coins on bitstamp?
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:56:42
How can you get people to participate in this. You basically need everyone if you really gonna find out
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:54:57
Well... There he is!
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:43:37
It almost sounds like he's about to start crying.
Maybe he's aware of the fact that they're fucked afterall
Time for plan ฿
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:50:42
Never heard of him but he seems like a professional troll
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:05:46
It's more difficult to hodl in bear markets imo
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:42:14
You need the seed or the wallet file and password
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:22:00
It's just a rumor
Rumors are usually that; rumors
@_date: 2016-07-16 13:00:31
He doesn't look happy.
Look more like "Ah, this motherfucker again? Well shit"
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:31:58
I have however heard that you have to send the coins to a channel before you spend it on whatever you're buying.
Sort of like a gift card.
So that is not very user friendly or practial if you ask me.
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:34:30
I don't know why I laughed lol
"kind of well made"
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:20:09
May I suggest something like this? 
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:45:43
Some guy sent $30k to an address which you can't recover the money from
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:29:10
@_date: 2016-07-16 13:01:48
So invest in ETH again?
Can anyone tell me about the implications of this in short? I can't open it
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:58:49
Let's get this bread.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:32:45
Lol i like the video
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:17:53
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:00:46
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:51:01
Im sorry. What?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:57:07
Good post
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:03:14
How are things worse than in 2014 security wise? Hashrate is still much higher than it was in 2014
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:21:28
$110 mil? And you just found out about this?
@_date: 2016-07-15 23:41:01
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:21:10
Can anyone explain what he means?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:34:51
$200 is a lot?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:07:30
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:58:33
I need it there in case I need to trade.
Also, I've heard that you should not store coins on an online machine that could be compromised either so. But how serious is that malware?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:36:13
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:19:58
Ah, I see. But still miners are in it for the long term and shouldn't really be interested in attacking it though.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:17:01
You mean it would be sitting pretty?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:46:17
I think 2600-2700 should be a good spot to pick up at.
If it breaks 3000 it might be best to just jump in
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:43:56
Bitcoin is at ATH and people are "losing faith"? Nah man, wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:46:15
How do you explain money coming into their accounts from bitcoin exchanges? Thats pretty suspicious
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:43:45
He paid a 2 btc fee to get it fast I guess, I don't know lol
@_date: 2019-05-09 09:33:42
How is it a ponzi scheme? Because those who get in on the thing first makes more money? That's literally how it is with everything.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:38:40
Precisely lmao
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:24:20
He said the ethereum isn't capped. So what is the inflation rate of ETH?
@_date: 2016-07-15 23:43:50
This picture has got me thinking. I normally wouldn't pay much attention to it but perhaps cutting an assets continous supply in half has some interesting dynamics to it.
Which is why I'm wondering if there's been any other asset that has worked in a similar way of bitcoins deflationary nature?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:39:18
Well people can trade differently and think different.
Not every successful trader is fit for buying into ether
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:39:59
Holy shit.  What could this mean? I had a feeling when we broke down $6k that we were simply going too low without any bounces and I might have to prepare for bitcoin actually dying, but I felt that when we broke downwards of $400 too in 2014. 
You think this could actually mean anything regarding bitcoin's survival?
