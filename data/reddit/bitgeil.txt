Thinking about debt will bring you to some answers. Study fractional banking and the money creation process. Also learn what the Federal Reserve actually does and how it is able to control the US government. Learn how the republicans and democrats are funded and led by the same bankers and FED economists. See how all that conserves the society, prevents change and manifests slavery of the "free".
It's a lot to study and not by coincidence. 
The "bitcoin overlords" do not control bitcoin. It's controlled by mathematical algorithms. Dollar, or any other potential world currency, is manipulated by a handful of people.
Learn it well and you'll be the leading edge of that "paradigm shift" (:

I'm not surprised either. Luckily our genious Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin in such a way that a later adopter needs necessarily no understanding of it's prime socio-economical purpose but only greed or the herd-instincts of a sheep.
Uups. Every bit of laughter will turn back to you painfully (law of nature).

For the commentators here. Paradigm shift does not equal to the widespread adoption of a new technology or a product. Paradigm shift is something more than the adoption of Bitcoin and I can see such a shift only happen after a serious degree of bitcoinization of the society.
I take it that OP is talking about a paradigm shift out of the modern global banking slavery.
Indeed, death will shortly occur, but a lot of continuous violence and misfortune will then cease.
