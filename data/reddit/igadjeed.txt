Over there is a common argument that non-mining nodes don't "have any voting power" in the consensus context. It took me weeks to realise that they're using that argument to justify the fact that BCash has no non-mining nodes.

You are ignoring two facts  
1. several thousand non-mining nodes currently support the Bitcoin Blockchain, for zero reward  
2. zero-reward mining will substantially reduce the number of miners, and consequently will reduce the energy consumption  
I expect that mining will return to 2009 levels, where Bitcoin enthsiasts mined blocks using spare CPU cycles on their home PC  


Zero-reward, and as I already said, altruistic  
You appear to be assuming that mining will always be expensive, just because it is expensive in 2018. The automatic self-adjustment feature of Bitcoin mining, built-in to the software, produces 1 block per 10 minutes, whether there are millions of miners hashing with ASICs or thousands of miners hashing on home PC

No it does not  
It needs to verify the hash of every block, but inside the blocks it only needs to see transactions which have UTXO  
Fully spent transactions can not be spent again, so they do not need to stay in their blocks  
SPV is completely irrelevant to Section 7 pruning  
Core pruning deletes the entire block and retains the UTXO and block index  
Section 7 pruning keeps all the blocks and deletes transactions which have no UTXO, deletes them from their blocks. You can build the same UTXO from this pruned chain as from the unpruned chain  
You can not build a UTXO from the Core pruned chain because the transactions were deleted when the non-recent blocks were deleted

Follow the warnings  
Use regtest mode or the test chain  
If you make a transaction for the main chain, remember that transaction fees are not an explicit part of a transaction. The miner  fee is calculated by subtracting output amounts from input amounts. This means it is easy to create a raw transaction with a miscalculated output, which will send a huge fee to the miner. Bitcoin transactions are not reversible

Your question makes the usual false assumption about fees  
The transaction sender sets the fee for every transaction  
Fees are only high if the sender wants the transaction confirmed quickly  
Because the accumulation of dirt coins (small UTXOs) is a result of laziness, transaction confirmation is not urgent  
Consolidation of small UTXOs can be done at any time, with a small fee of 1 Sat / byte, possibly less  
Submit the transaction, wait for confirmation  
If the transaction disappears from the mempool without confirmation, submit it again

A block can not be added to the blockchain until a miner discovers a SHA-256 hash value for that block, where the winning SHA-256 value must be an integer below a specified value  
Every 2016 blocks, the specified value is adjusted up or down depending on whether the most recent 2016 blocks were created in more time than 20160 minutes or less time than 20160 minutes  
If there has been a recent increase in total hashing power, usually the most recent 2016 blocks will have been created in less than 20160 minutes. The target hash integer value is reduced proportionally, to make it harder to find the next 2016 blocks  
and vice versa if the most recent 2016 blocks took more than 20160 minutes  


Because SHA-256 calculations have an "apparently random" distribution from one calculation to the next, the time it takes to discover the winning hash for a single block is unpredictable. The 10-minute interval is a medium-term average - this is also the reason the mining difficulty is adjusted only every 2016 blocks

Half-right  
The Mt Gox hack is a myth  
As the dominant Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox was also the main source of exchange prices  
They exploited this position by quoting false exchange rates on their site. This created a false price discrepancy relative to other exchanges. Mt Gox used the price discrepancy as an arbitrage opportunity, trading their customers' money for Mt Gox profit. This fraud failed when the actual price moved outside the range of the arbitrage quicker than Mt Gox could exit their trading position  
Everything after that, the hack claims, theft claims, transaction malleability error claims, were all distractions to cover the huge arbitrage trading loss which destroyed Mt Gox's liquidity

By hashing the 2 Merkle hashes under it  
When all transactions have been pruned from a block, there is no requirement to calculate the Merkle root, and the block only contains its header  


Correct  
If transaction pruning is implemented, some Merkle branch hashes must be stored in the block  
Following the diagram in Section 7, a pruned transaction is replaced by its hash, and the hashes for an adjacent pair of pruned transactions are replaced by their Merkle hash, and so on, as adjacent pairs are pruned over time

No, this is the whole point, you would not shut the network down. You would be the only person making transactions until your money ran out. Bitcoin continues adding one block of transactions to the Blockchain every 10 minutes whatever the transaction fees are. Your money would eventually run out, your attack would finish, life would return to normal. The only effect your fee spending attack has is to temporarily boost miner income  


Blocks are full. Long confirmation delays are a consequence. High fees are a consequence of confirmation delays  




No and no  
Bitcoin is an elegant inter-operation of software and networking which keeps running by itself. The block size is what it is, the block interval is what it is. The maximum transaction rate is a function of those things  
Bitcoin keeps on running, not broken, nothing to fix  
"But blocks are full, someone has to fix it", screams the peanut gallery  
How about, blocks are full, Bitcoin has reached its maximum capacity. We can adopt a different coin instead, maybe Litecoin. Then in a year or two, Litecoin blocks fill up, adopt another different coin

Good question  
Especially in the current climate of confirmation delays  
I trust the nearby Bitcoin ATM  
But, I noticed yesterday, they've installed a new ATM right next to it which sells Litecoins - nearly instant confirmation, low fees  
Now, if I was in your position and wanting to acquire thousands worth of Bitcoins, what escrow options are there for selling Litecoins to buy Bitcoins?  


Tragically, no  
It's all about full blocks and confirmation delays  
High fees can reduce confirmation delays, but no guarantees of fast confirmation

I'm a bit rusty on how to use the Core wallet to make raw tx, because I find Electrum a bit easier for this  
You have to get the addresses and pubkeys from somewhere, but you can still do this without syncing the blockchain if you supply the prevtxs array to signrawtransaction, and you might also have to supply the private keys for signing  
Your signrawtransaction command would have returned an error

The point you miss is that node propagation is not constrained by network speed, but by the processing speed of the nodes, and the processing speed for verifying blocks would be constrained by heavy disk access, so the developers moved a lot of data into RAM to reduce the latency of heavy disk access. A consequence of this RAM optimisation is that the RAM requirement for a node increases non-linearly with block size - 2GB for 1 MB blocks, 8 GB for 2MB blocks. A study in 2015 found that the RAM requirement means that if the block size is increased from 1 MB to 2MB, the number of nodes would fall by 50%. The security of the Blockchain is dependent on the number of independently operated nodes - this is the "decentralised" feature of Bitcoin. A 50% reduction in node count is a major impact on Bitcoin, and the benefit is medium term at best - if 1 MB blocks are full today, then 2 MB blocks will be full in 12 - 18 months. Not secure to lose 50% of nodes for a "solution" which only lasts 18 months

For setting your own fee, there is nothing better than Electrum (desktop version)  
If you're not in a hurry to get your alts, set the fee to somewhere from 2300-5000 Satoshis (around 10-15 Sat/byte depending on your tx size), and wait. If the transaction disappears from the mempool without being confirmed, submit it again. If your patience eventually runs out, increase the fee

Moore's Law has been obsolete for decades  
CPU speed today is dependent on asynchronous preemptive execution, a technique which recently took a huge hit, because it was discovered to be insecure by design  
In any case, CPU speed is not an important constraint in choosing the optimum block size for Bitcoin  
The Bitcoin Blockchain is distributed across several thousand independently operated nodes. Every new block must be verified by every node and then forwarded to every other node. The accumulated delay for block propagation is the single most sensitive factor determining whether Bitcoin keeps working. Bitcoin would stall if new blocks were delayed by incomplete propagation of earlier blocks. In order to minimise propagation delay, the Bitcoin node software is optimised to maximise the use of RAM. The minimum RAM requirement for a Bitcoin node is currently 2GB  
Because of the way Bitcoin nodes are optimised by storing a lot of commonly accessed data in RAM, increasing the block size has a non-linear effect on the minimum RAM requirement for a node. Increasing the block size to 2MB will increase the RAM requirement to 8GB  
The number of independently operated nodes is important for Bitcoin to remain free from ledger corruption and payment censorship. Increasing the RAM requirement from 2GB to 8GB would force most nodes to upgrade. A large proportion of nodes would drop out of the Bitcoin network  
Read the research:  
  
Bitcoin works because blocks are propagated quickly  
Bitcoin works because it has thousands of independently operated nodes  
Do not put the fundamental operation of Bitcoin at risk just because your transaction is delayed by full blocks

Of course you can  
A blockchain can be mined without rewarding the miners  
When Satoshi coded Bitcoin, it was convenient to issue a new coin at the same time as creating a new block, and the simplest place to send the coins is to the miner who creates the block  
Creating a blockchain coin with zero-reward mining is not difficult. Discovering a different mechanism for issuing new coins requires some imagination, but not too much  


The official view is that decentralised blockchain currencies remove currency control from Governments and Central Banks, and this is a "bad thing"  
Read the IMF blockchain paper:   
Governments, Central Banks and IMF have a view that they can cherry-pick the bits of Bitcoin they like (Blockchain), and discard the bits they don't like (decentralised)  
They think there's some benefit in having centralised blockchain currencies, and they have asked their media puppets to convey this view. Media puppets happy to comply

In fact the banks close Bitcoin traders' accounts without giving reasons  
or occasionally mention "risk" issues  
Banks have a regulatory obligation to assess money laundering risks. When a customer explains to her bank that she is using the account to buy and sell Bitcoin, the bank has a choice:  
* do some research to understand Bitcoin and the customer's Bitcoin trading business, properly assess the money laundering risk, evaluate the customer's processes, and work with the customer to ensure that the risks are mitigated  
* do no research, and close down the customer's account because there is a risk in knowing nothing about the legitimate reasons for running a business with large amounts of money going in and out

Because the Bitcoin fiat exchange rate keeps increasing

If the market is rational, all such currencies could tend towards an equilibrium, eventually trade in a small range around a stable value  


I'm not convinced that cryptocurrencies can replace fiat currencies. The process you describe is technically possible but does not persuade civilised society to abandon government control of money  
The first step is to achieve the goal in the origin document - cash-equivalent payments for online transactions, to defeat the censorship imposed on and by centrally-controlled payment services  
In parallel, there is an unmet demand to ban credit card and password based online payments, due to unsolvable liability issues. How many more 60 million credit card number thefts are needed before a class-action lawsuit makes it too financially risky to pass secret credentials around the Internet?  
Beyond that, most people are not comfortable with the potential disruption to taxation and credit markets, and various other effects like worldwide price equalisation, which could be caused by removing money powers from governments

To delay the creation of new blocks  
For Bitcoin to be secure, there needs to be thousands of nodes maintaining separate, identical copies of the Blockchain. Every new block is verified to be correct by each node, and is then passed to the neighbour nodes. The block interval ensures that full propagation of the previous block is complete before each new block is created  


What argument?  


Bitcoin is deliberately designed so that it does not matter  
Bitcoin makes no judgement on which of the transactions is "correct"  


There is no order  
One gets confirmed, and this prevents the other one. The choice of which transaction gets confirmed is arbitrary, undefined, unpredictable, unimportant

The coins are not marked. Coins are exchanged between people who have coins available to tumble, and people who need their coins to be tumbled. They do not belong to the tumbler service  


You can not protect your own privacy just by practicing no re-use. If you send coins to someone else who re-uses addresses, their laziness compromises your privacy  
Also privacy is compromised by any address which has ever been published on a publicly visible page. If Google has seen it, the owner can be identified. If you send your coins to that address, then your privacy is compromised by association

Chain fork coins are parasites feeding on the Bitcoin price bubble,  
only viable because there is so much upside hype in the Bitcoin price that worthless fork coins can attain values between 200 and 400 on launch  
When the Bitcoin price bubble collapses, this type of fork will disappear, because the fork coin launch price will be zero  
As you said, the BCH price is the only significant earner in your list  
For most of its life BCH hovered around 400 so if someone was living off fork windfalls, they would probably have redeemed their BCH coins in August 2017, at 600 or less

It's an experiment

Bitcoin developers decided not to increase block size. Their reasons have been repeated 1000 times in this subreddit and in other forums  
Believing that it's more important to have bigger blocks, and deciding to ignore the warnings about propagation bottlenecks and node centralisation, a group of developers made BCash, with 2MB blocks  
If the BCash experiment works, BCash will not suffer any block propagation bottleneck, or node software crashes, when its 2MB blocks approach their capacity  
If the BCash developers are wrong, they'll make their excuses, but BCash will be gone forever

Because mining is designed as a diminishing returns model, it makes no sense to claim any figure for energy use per transaction, or even energy use per block  
Unfortunately, mining hash rates continue to increase in spite of having diminishing Bitcoin returns, because Bitcoin is suffering an unprecedented price bubble. The increasing fiat exchange price of Bitcoin makes Bitcoin mining more profitable from month to month because mining is more profitable in fiat prices  
When the bubble ends, the price will return to sensible levels, the mining hash rate will reduce proportionally, and energy use will fall in equal proportion

There are no real numbers  
All the Bitcoin energy media stories are based on a couple of articles in digiconomist  
  
The base figure in the digiconomist calculation: Implied Watts per GH/s 0.269  
is overstated  
The great majority of Bitcoin mining is dominated by one mining device, the Antminer S9, which has a power consumption of 0.098 joules per gigahash, as stated in the article linked from the "Energy consumption model and key assumptions" paragraph  
You would get more accurate calculations by reducing the digiconomist calculation by 64%  
And then, for long-term planning, consider that the current Bitcoin price is economically unsustainable, and when the price falls to its natural level under $2, the mining hash rate and energy consumption will fall in proportion to the price fall

All backup methods have flaws  
The most reliable methods are paper and DVD-R, with HDD close behind  
The worst are Flash ROM and SSD - subject to instant and complete failure  
The important thing about a backup is whether you can use it to restore when you need it  
The technique for mitigating against backup failure:  
* assume any backup will inevitably fail  
* make multiple copies and store them in separate locations  
* check every copy frequently to discover if it has degraded or failed  
* replace any damaged copy by making a new backup from an undamaged copy  
If you're using a HD wallet, backup the seed words  
Otherwise backup all the private keys

Correct. All the components of Bitcoin inter-operate in a way that solves the logistical problems of making an uncensorable currency  


Mining has one purpose - to regulate the rate of new blocks to one per 10 minutes on average  
The Bitcoin Blockchain exists as thousands of separate identical copies on thousands of independently operated nodes. This is necessary to protect Bitcoin from payment censorship and other regulatory and political interference  
Because there are thousands of nodes, it takes time to propagate every new block to every node. This is why blocks have to be delayed by the mining process. If new blocks are created before all the previous blocks have been added to the Blockchain on all the thousands of nodes, then Bitcoin would become gridlocked, would stop working  


Incorrect  
Greedy miners will stop mining Bitcoin if there is no profit  
They will be replaced by altruistic, non-profit miners  
There will be fewer miners  
Bitcoin automatically adjusts the mining parameters to ensure one block every 10 minutes, whether there are 100 miners or 100,000 miners

No, I am not saying that  
I am saying the greatest risk of loss is failure of the backup media  
USB flash drives are subject to sudden total failure, even when left on a shelf  
Optical - CD-ROM or DVD-R - are subject to gradual degradation due to ink degradation over 5-10 years, and partial unreadability due to scratches or other physical damage  
Paper is subject to ink fading, insect attack, moisture and fungal stains, fire risk and acid corrosion  
And so on  
I'm recommending either paper or optical  
* multiple copies in separate places  
* assume the backups will degrade or fail  
* check all copies every 3-6 months  
* when you find an error, replace the bad copies by making new copies from the good copies

You are overthinking a trivial issue  
Change addresses are the same as receiving addresses  
The only requirement for keeping your coins safe is to have a backup of all your private keys  
The Core wallet documentation recommends backing up wallet.dat frequently  
There should always be a recent wallet.dat backup which contains every batch of 100 keys  
Heavy users can choose to generate more than 100 keys at a time  
Some users forgot to backup frequently enough, some users lost their backups, coins were lost  
HD wallets were invented to eliminate the requirement to do wallet backups  
Today, users forget their seed words, forget their Ledger PIN, coins are lost  
Nothing has changed  


You're confused  
2 addresses, not 2 wallets  
In Bitcoin there is no such thing as a wallet  
For day-to-day usage the word "wallet" was chosen to describe a set of keys controlled by a single person  
A wallet has many keys  
Each key has an address for receiving funds  
Receiving change is the same as receiving funds from someone else  


Almost, but there is an important difference  
The USD cash register contains your $10 bill and you hold your $5 bill  
After a Bitcoin transaction  
* your $10 bill vanishes  
* the merchant owns a brand new $5 bill  
* you own a brand new $5 bill


You made a backup of wallet.dat when you set it up  
It contains the first 100 keys  
Months later, after using all those 100 keys on pizza purchases, the wallet generates another 100 keys for many more months of pizza purchases  
From then on, all receiving addresses and all change addresses are in the second set of 100 keys  
If the wallet.dat backup only contains the first 100 keys, then it has zero value  
Lost change  
This was not an issue in the Core wallet  
There are (or were) problems in the UI of some wallets which failed to display change amounts without some extra mouse clicks. The coins were not lost, but not visible by default. Some users, those who misunderstand the purpose of change addresses - see above, the $10 bill vanishes - think they've been hacked, panic delete the wallet, and lose all their coins. It's common to blame the unfriendly UI for these incidents, but the loss is really the user's fault for deliberately, recklessly deleting the wallet file  
This article is much better written if anybody wants to understand user-error coin loss:  
  


Safety is 2 separate issues, and the more important issue is often ignored  
* safety from theft  
* safety from data loss  
When a pizza was worth 5000 Bitcoins, nobody was stealing Bitcoins  
Even today, the biggest loss of Bitcoins is data loss, and the most common cause is user negligence

Define "longer"  
I can see that my node is going to get blocks which don't fit in its chain  
because the previous block hash is not matching  
What I can't see is how my node can tell that it's my chain which has an orphan block/branch, as opposed to rejecting the incoming block because it doesn't fit on my chain  
Is there some sort of timer or counter, or do I just "know" I'm out of sync because 2 or more peers are sending blocks which don't fit my chain?

I think I missed something in your comment  
Are you saying that when I get an orphan block, that other peers will send me the "correct" block (same height) at the same time?

A minor correction first:  


"Complexity" is the wrong word. Miners are solving a "hard" problem, where "hard" does not mean "complex". It just means a lot of work is required - simple repetition work  
A one-way hash is a mathematical algorithm which is fast to calculate, but practically impossible to calculate in reverse  
Bitcoin uses the SHA256 algorithm, a simple set of steps which processes an arbitrary list of bits and creates a "hash" which is 256 bits long  
Ken Shirriff's explanation is well-written:  
  
In the Bitcoin mining context, the detail people forget to mention is that if you change just one bit of the input data, the SHA256 hash is completely different, and is unguessable  
The main purpose of Bitcoin mining is to delay new blocks for long enough to allow the previous block to be propagated to thousands of Bitcoin nodes, the guardians of the Bitcoin Blockchain  
As others mentioned already, every block has a target, a minimum value for the SHA256 hash. The probability of hitting this target is proportional to it's value. Lower values are harder to find  
The miner's job is  
* apply the SHA256 algorithm to the block header
* test if the hash is less than the target value  
* make a tiny change to part of the block header  
* repeat  
The current global Bitcoin hash rate is 19.7 Exahashes per second. The difficulty target is automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks, to keep the block interval close to 10 minutes  
19.7 Exahash / sec * 600 seconds = 11820000000000000000000 hashes per block  


In summary, Bitcoin mining is simple brute force iteration of the SHA256 algorithm, by miners racing to discover a hash below the current target

If it did happen as described, he was experimenting with a multi-step process involving hand-crafting raw transactions, and left out the step where, after making a private key for the change address to receive the 8999, he forgot to store that private key anywhere  
See this example:   
Note that Shirriff still has access to his private key at the end, but only because he hard-coded it into one of his Python scripts  


Every wallet has dozens or hundreds or thousands of keys, one address per key. Each address is supposed to be used once only  
Please read:   


This is false  
Your wallet has dozens of private keys when it's new, and probably hundreds of private keys after you've done your share of shopping with Bitcoin  
Some HD wallets make people think they have only one key pair, one receiving address, because they only require the seed key to be backed up  
In reality the seed key is simply a mathematical starting point to creating thousands of private keys, and thousands of addresses, one for every key

Infrastructure is irrelevant to this. Anybody can set up a Bitcoin wallet on a Web shop. Merchants would accept Bitcoin if their customers demand it. With a few exceptions - VPN, Usenet and other file sharing - customers do not care about anonymity, and only a handful of merchants have been refused service by credit card providers  
Customers love their loyalty points, refund promises, easy chargebacks. Bitcoin payments only fit a few niches

This very strange argument is popular in some other subreddit, that non-mining nodes are irrelevant, that every miner runs a node and only miners decide whether a block is valid  
I suspect it is a twisted justification for the fact that BCash nodes are concentrated in a way which parallels the argument - there are no independently operated non-mining BCash nodes  
I'm hoping for a rapid increase in BCash adoption. Can BCash recover when their large blocks get so full that the nodes crash, and then the miners have no nodes to send them new transactions?

You're wrong. The longest chain is the one with more work  


Definitely not  
**Each node operates independently**  
If a node receives a new block which can not sync with its existing chain tip, this makes it "aware" that there is a split. It measures the work on both sides of the split. If the node's current chain tip has less work, then one or more blocks are discarded and replaced by downloading the replacement blocks from neighbours  
Your "what if 50%" scenario is not important. As says in another comment, the process is the same for every node, and every node can reorganise its tip, whether one node has an "orphaned chain tip", or whether thousands of nodes have temporarily split

Until a transaction is confirmed, the coins are still owned by the sender  
The sender can submit multiple transactions  
Bitcoin does not allow double-spends, but only the first confirmed transaction gets into the Blockchain, not necessarily the oldest transaction  


The fee is only spent when the transaction is confirmed. Until then, there is no fee  
The transaction fee is not an explicit part of a transaction, it is the calculated difference between input amounts and output amounts

This will fill the default 300MB mempool, which is currently about 30% full  
The oldest transactions will be removed from the mempool to make space  
The additional 200MB of transactions would begin to be confirmed in about 6 days, at an eventual cost of about 4 billion Satoshis = 40 Bitcoin  
A minor blip, very few people would notice  


300MB of transactions with fees high enough for immediate confirmation  
would be all confirmed in 2-3 days at a cost of about 1050 Bitcoin  
Your "someone" is paying $11.8 million to miners to delay the normal business of Bitcoin users by 3 days

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, and Bitcoin exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

A transaction without a change output will send the change to the miner in the form of fees  
There are no wallets which do this. It is only possible if you're building transactions by hand, and all the "make your own transactions" articles warn that it's not for beginners, and warn about the need to accurately check the input amounts and output amounts, then subtract outputs from inputs to check the fees  
Apparently there is a problem with some wallets hiding the change outputs from the user and making the user think the coins have vanished. This needs to be addressed by the software developers, not documented in a guide

shapeshift has a minimum transaction amount of about $250 for coin to coin exchange  
changelly has a lower minimum, you could buy $50 of dogecoin, but not $15  
Bitcoin is currently suffering long transaction confirmation delays and high fees  
I'm currently exchanging Bitcoin for Dogecoin on changelly, but I set the fee to 2300 Satoshis, so the transaction will probably take a few weeks to confirm  
If you're in a hurry, you'll end up paying a $70 fee to process a $30 transaction  
Small amounts, high transaction fees, this will make your experience unpleasant  
If you're buying small amounts from Coinbase, consider buying Litecoin for lower fees and faster transaction confirmation

Bitcoin has no tangible value  
Its intangible value is in being able to facilitate transactions which are not possible using the old methods - credit card, paypal, cash  
These transactions add economic value to the world economy

Therefore its scarcity adds no value

Sometimes, especially for large amounts  
There is a small chance that 2 miners can mine different blocks at the same time. One, two or more blocks later, the network nodes make a choice between the two blocks. Nodes with the rejected block will remove that block and its descendants (if any) from the tip of their Blockchains and reorganise their chain tip by downloading the accepted block and its descendants from other nodes  
If your transaction is in the rejected block, then its status might be confirmed, then unconfirmed, until it appears in a later block  
Any unconfirmed transaction is a potential opportunity for the transaction sender to send the same bitcoins to himself  
Waiting for 3 or more confirmations reduces the risk of this type of fraud

If you do it that way, you're inviting fraud, because you have no reliable way to verify that the customer claiming the refund is the same person who initiated the transaction. If the refund address is supplied at the time of initiating the transaction, then you don't even need a support conversation. You know the refund address belongs to the customer, because the customer entered it before sending Bitcoin  
It's not confusing, it only requires a QR scan. Every merchant should implement the collection of a refund address at every sale, as a standard part of the sale process. Some (not enough) already do this

The common man will be freed from the chains of debt forever  
The probem with your question is that it poses a hypothetical where you're mixing a revolutionary change with a status quo view of the world  
Nothing is the same after a revolution  
Identify the assumptions in your question, and discard them, then build a scenario from new premises - all cash, no credit  
You can not buy a house with cash today because the price is more than you can save, therefore you have to borrow  
Does it not occur that the house price is unaffordable because the housing market sets prices on the basis of debt purchase?  
Eliminate credit/debt from the economy, and houses can only be sold to buyers who can afford to buy them with cash - that is, houses prices fall by 80%-90% because debt has disappeared from the economy

Bitcoin has a limited transaction capacity  
All the coins based on Bitcoin have a similar transaction limit  
All the coins not based on Bitcoin are fragile - Ethereum, Iota  
Even some of the coins based on Bitcoin are fragile, especially the chain fork coins with larger blocks  
These coins, Bcash and BGold, will find their node networks overwhelmed by block propagation delays when they reach Bitcoin-like transaction volumes, before they manage to fill their big blocks  
The older Bitcoin-based coins - Litecoin, Dogecoin and similar - will soon see higher transaction volume from Bitcoin users unwilling to suffer long confirmation delays  
Fairly soon, those coins will have full blocks and confirmation delays  
More Bitcoin-like coins will be launched, and will soak up the excess transaction volumes  
And so on, in a natural evolution, until there are thousands of similar coins sharing the cryptocurrency ecosystem

You can't cancel it  
You can build a new transaction with just one input (the largest one), and a higher fee  
When that transaction confirms, the old one can never confirm because Bitcoin does not permit double-spending  
Hopefully, the mempool will one day be small enough to let you consolidate all those dirt outputs with a low fee  
Or you could send a 1 Sat / byte transaction just to consolidate the dirt, and wait forever, resubmit every 3-4 weeks

Section 7 pruning has not been implemented yet  
Every time I mention it, some genius tells me Core has already implemented pruning  
I've never been able to get a rational response to the reason this has not been done  
The answers are like "not everything in the White Paper was implemented"  
Or vague "it can't be made to work"  
Or evasive "Core is afraid of losing the transaction data"  
A minor correction, it's more than pruning branches off the Merkle hash tree  
More importantly, Section 7 proposes removing spent transactions  
And then, if enough spent transactions are removed from a block, the lower Merkle branches can be removed as well  
The most obvious reason Section 7 pruning has not been implemented is that it is not yet necessary. The Blockchain is still less than 200GB, which is only a few dollars worth of disk space. Section 7 pruning would not reduce the initialisation time for a new node, because the initialisation time is delayed by syncing the node indexes, not the download time  
More, you could always code it yourself. It does not need a hard fork. Core pruned nodes already exist alongside full nodes. There is nothing to prevent full nodes and Core pruned nodes, and Section 7 pruned nodes co-existing in the main net  
Any competent coder could implement Section 7 pruning in a month or two of coding work, maybe less  
It's worth doing

Bitcoin is a system of networked software which is designed to keep running by itself - as long as there is at least one node and one miner running the software  
Bitcoin was designed to be a convenient payment method for Internet transactions, especially when other payment methods are unavailable  
Bitcoin transactions work as designed. This gives value to Bitcoin as money - buyer and seller agree to send and receive a specific amount of Bitcoin to purchase something. They are therefore agreeing that Bitcoin has a specific value relative to the purchase item  
In 2010 someone sent 10000 Bitcoins to someone else to send 2 pizzas. Bitcoin is worth 0.0002 pizza  
Eighteen months later people are paying $2 per Bitcoin  
Bitcoin is not an investment. There is a small group of speculators buying Bitcoin in the hope of capital gain. This speculation drove up the price - self-fulfilling speculation. The speculation bubble will eventually burst. Bitcoin will return to being a useful currency for buying things on the Internet, with a price somewhere in the $1 to $2 range

True, but missing details, the things "everybody knows" but really only insiders know. If bandwidth is an issue, there should be a bandwidth comparison between client-side filters and node-served Bloom filters  
There is also a contradiction between the text in BIP37 which downplays the DoS risk and the current claim that potential DoS is the reason for deprecating node-served Bloom filters. I guess the opinion has changed over time, fair enough. But Schildbach has a point, Bloom filter DoS is a potential problem, not an active attack (as far as I'm aware)  
There is a reference to Electrum  


which does not explain Electrum's mechanisms for supplying transaction history to wallets  
And a different tangent, an option missing from the discussion: Are these filtering mechanisms workarounds to avoid building an index of transactions by address? Is the main reason the Core node does not have an address index to avoid the disk space it would use?

Did you miss this?  
  
The Internet is a person-to-person communications network. Giant platforms are not necessary. They are redundant, a temporary aberration  
How do Bitcoin developers communicate?  
GitHub: this is a giant platform containing Git repositories. Git is an open source software tool for software teams to coordinate their work and manage software changes  
Arguably, Bitcoin Core should not be using GitHub now. They could easily set up a Git server and run it themselves  
IRC: This is a real-time text chat system, with open source servers and clients. Currently the Bitcoin Core team has a channel on the freenode IRC server network, a medium-size non-profit network of IRC servers  
As with Git, setting up an IRC server is 30 minutes work, if there was some regulatory pressure killing the non-profit open public networks like freenode  
Mailing lists: currently hosted at another non-profit, could easily be moved if necessary  
Reddit provides very little useful communication about Bitcoin. Nobody would miss it. Twitter, even less useful

Also, since your plan involves Coinbase Pro, you can buy on Coinbase Pro for a maker fee of 0.15%. This is less than the CashApp purchase fee. Then the rest of your plan is simplified by the ability to withdraw from Coinbase Pro to your personal wallet's SegWit addresses for zero fees

Fine  
Here's how your suggestion would work ...  
Make a change to consensus rules  
A transaction is valid without a signature if:  
*    the inputs are spending UTXOs which are more than 100 years old  
*    the transaction has no outputs (this causes all the input value to go to miner fees)  
If you understand what I wrote above - about inputs, UTXO, outputs and fees - then you know enough about Bitcoin consensus to discuss this suggestion  
Note: this was not my idea. I copied it from an old discussion about this subject. That's where the "100 years" comes from. Personally, I'd prefer 6 months, but then I would be launching my own coin, not imposing coin expiry on Bitcoin  
I also have different reasons for supporting coin expiry. Lost coins are not important because Bitcoin is further divisible. Miner income is not important, for reasons which are hotly debated somewhere else  
Coin expiry is important because lost coins cause the UTXO database to grow without bound. Any unbounded database is not sustainable in the long term. This issue will not be important for more than 10 years from now

More accurate to say that it's double-SHA2-256 of the block header, as it always has been. The difference between then and now is that nonce has been made less useful by hash power, and is aided by extranonce. In the block header, the proxy for extranonce is the Merkle root hash  
Yes, extranonce is varied by changing the Merkle root, but does not require recalculating the entire Merkle tree. The miner only needs to recalculate the hash of TX0 and the Merkle branch nodes above it, including the root. The calculation of transaction hashes and Merkle branch hashes uses (surprise!) SHA2-256  
Yes, it would be tidier to replace the 4-byte nonce with a larger data element in the header. Move the entire 40-byte OP_RETURN output from TX0 into the header and allow it to hold the same arbitrary strong of bits it does now. The header would be substantially larger, but we would not have to recalculate the Merkle root  
Your complexity question is not important. ASIC manufacturing is centralised by the drive to get more hashes using less power. Having a different instruction execution path for a hash has little impact  
Continuing in that vein, it doesn't actually matter what the specific instructions are for the mining process, so the idea of moving extranonce into the header is nothing more than a tidiness obsession, therefore not worth doing. Keep the process messy  
Tangentially relevant ...  
It is now common practice to change a block's transaction set during mining. Each time this happens, the Merkle tree needs to be recalculated

It's not that hard to understand large numbers from exponentiation. Everybody learns exponentiation in high school  
One extra digit in a binary number doubles the number of possible values. Double and double and double ... and fairly quickly you get a number big enough to count the number of particles in the universe. This number is a lot smaller than 256 bits  


Here's a magic seed word generator  
  
It has a checkbox "Show entropy details"  
This allows someone to enter their own entropy - coin tosses, dice throws, card shuffles  
If you enter card values, the information on the page shows that you get 4.34 bits of entropy per card, so you would need more than one shuffle to get 256 bits of entropy

When you hover your mouse over the fee slider it displays BTC / kB  
Sat / byte is not available  
so you have to use a calculator, or an online converstion Web page to convert to Sat / byte  
BTC / kB * 100000 = Sat / byte  
0.0003 BTC / kB = 30 Sat / byte  
Alternatively, multiply your preferred Sat / byte by the number of bytes in your transaction, divide by 100 million, and use the electrum payto command to set the fee in BTC  
A 1-input 2-output transaction will be about 230 bytes, so 10 Sat / byte will be 2300 Sat, which is 0.00002300 BTC  
For example:  
    electrum payto -f 0.00002300 -F 17WYq3VTs3DKRXZ1KYcKDmABaFztM4KY3m -c 1NuWkMzYeeLKegjss9xr6DR9i1VEENqMMx -u 1H8KpWJKBJnuj6eY2qXF2K6vd4s5dqEgBp 0.0053  
and then use the deserialize command to check the transaction  
then the signtransaction command  
then deserialize again to double-check  
then broadcast

Good question  
The quick answer is that your first backup is good forever because it contains the private seed key, and all other keys are derived from this  
The long answer is that your wallet also contains your transaction history. If you restore from your original backup, then your transaction history needs to be restored by scanning the Blockchain. This is very slow. Also, if your node is pruned, rescanning is not possible  
More backups make it easier by avoiding rescanning to build transaction history, but the original backup is sufficient for ensuring you always have access to your keys, and therefore to your bitcoins

Not just miner A, but every miner now has to begin hashing a new block  


Mostly true. Mining is done in pools and most pool managers choose the transactions for their pool members. This means all the miners in the same pool are mining the same transactions. Except that the pool manager can send a different list of transactions to some pool members part-way through mining  
Summary:  
*    every pool is mining a different block to every other pool  
*    some pools allow pool members to choose some of their own transactions  
*    the contents of a block can change, and is changed by the pool manager mid-way through mining a block  


Mostly yes. There is not a single pool of unconfirmed transactions. A node will remove transactions from its mempool when those transactions appear in a newly mined block. Some nodes might do this more accurately or more quickly than other nodes  
More importantly, if the miner accidentally includes an already confirmed transaction in a new block, then all the nodes will reject the new block and the miner does not get paid for all that work. To avoid this risk of not getting paid, the miner (mining pool manager) ensures that the new block never contains already confirmed transactions **even if they are in a mempool of a neighbour node**  


Every miner has to start mining a new block from scratch anyway, because the mining process is calculating the SHA-2 hash of the 80-byte block header. Part of this header is the hash of the previous block. It would be pointless to keep mining a header which contains the hash of the previous-previous block

The argument in favour of coin expiry is that if you still own the coin, and you know about the coin expiry rules, you can move your coin to another address (owned by you) before it expires  
This means that all "expired" coins are either lost or their owner forgot to move them in time

A zero-conf so-called double-spend fraud is nearly impossible anyway. No Core node will accept both transactions. The second will be rejected with a message "already in mempool", based on checking the transactions' inputs  
Maybe a thief can work out a way to get the two transactions into two separate nodes, and then the two transactions propagate to different groups of nodes, according to node connectivity and propagation timing  
Even then, the miner's node will see one transaction first, according to his node's connectivity, and then reject the other one. He will not choose by fee, because he only sees one of the two transactions in his mempool  
RBF offers the best opportunity. Wait for full mempools. Send a minimum-fee transaction. If the merchant accepts the transaction with zero confirmations, send a RBF transaction spending the same inputs back to the sender's wallet  
See a different thread from a few days ago, about a merchant accepting zero-conf and accelerating confirmation of low-fee transactions using CPFP. A thief could find his RBF fraud racing the merchant's CPFP

This document was written just before Bitcoin was launched:   
The rational justification for Bitcoin as a payment currency is given on the first page  


I pay for groceries in a real shop using cash because cash is not encumbered with the baggage which comes with using an electronic card. Online, I choose Bitcoin for the same reason - if the merchant accepts it  
To date, merchants adopt Bitcoin where they have customers who want to avoid the surveillance which comes with centralised payment systems. I register an account with a VPN provider so that my Internet activity cannot be tracked. A credit card or a PayPal account can be tracked to my real identity, so please let me use Bitcoin instead. Some of these merchants also accept cash by mail because they understand their customers' privacy requirements  
More adoption? Ask online merchants why their customers are not demanding to have the choice to pay with Bitcoin  
The love of loyalty points and refund guarantees is a deep and meaningful bond  
As for all the price discussions - completely irrelevant. Bitcoin is infested with greedy speculators driving a greater fool bubble. The fundamentals do not justify a price higher than $2. The bubble will eventually burst. The speculation sideshow will disappear

The white paper has no mention of block size  
The current block size was chosen later, after some early experience  
The reluctance to increase the block size is mainly related to the risk of increasing block propagation delay - that is, there needs to be a lot of headroom below the 10-minute block interval. If blocks are not fully propagated before the next block arrives, a bottleneck could be created - nodes too busy catching up with the propagation of old blocks are unable to process new blocks  
The other issue is the number of Bitcoin nodes. If the Bitcoin network only has a few nodes, then it becomes a small target for regulators who would like to impose payment censorship and chargeback rules, similar to the rules imposed on Visa  
This research paper:   
shows that increasing the block size from 1MB to 2MB would reduce the number of nodes by 50%  
The BCash advocates, for all their bleating about being true to Satoshi vision and white paper, deny the need for a large node network. BCash has a small number of nodes, barely enough to support the mining pools adding new blocks to the BCash blockchain. Because of its tiny node network, BCash is exposed to the risk of regulatory interference. Its node network is centralised

A foolish assumption, as most assumptions are

@_date: 2018-01-20 03:51:53
Hmm  
A few clues which might help  
The Blockchain is never modified, only added to  
Transactions have one or more outputs  
In White Paper terminology, a "coin" is an output which has not been spent, that is, has not been used as input to a newer transaction  
Developer terminology refers to "coin" as "UTXO", means unspent transaction output  
A coin can only be spent once, and can not be partially spent  
Section 7 pruning proposes to remove "spent transactions", that is, transactions where all the outputs have been spent, transactions with no coins. This is OK because a coin can only be spent once, can only be spent fully  
Some other objections to Section 7 pruning:  
It breaks the above rule, that the Blockchain is never modified, changes it to  
The Blockchain is never modified, only added to **except that spent transactions and their Merkle branches can be pruned from their blocks to save disk space**  
The other objection is questionable, but should not be ignored:  
Removing spent transactions prevents traceback from any coin all the way back through a path of transactions to its original "coinbase mining transaction", an audit trail concept  
In reality, it's impossible to trace many coins back to their coinbase because the existence of multi-input multi-output transactions means that a lot of coins have hundreds of paths back to hundreds of coinbase  
Terminology note: coinbase means the coins that are awarded to miners as a mining reward, the first transaction in every block

The TXO of the generation transaction will be the same for all miners in a pool if all miners are mining the same set of transactions, but the extra-nonce will be different from miner to miner, so that miners do not do duplicate work.

There used to be huge forums for awesome ideas for solar LTD engines. My favourite was a wheel with soda cans attached. Put a small amount of liquid in each can. Connect opposite pairs of cans with a tube and seal the connections. Orient the wheel so that one side is in sunlight. The sun's heat drives water to the cold side and the gravity imbalance turns the wheel

There are recent proposals for regulations which require cryptocurrency exchanges to share the identity of the sending and receiving users when coins are sent from exchange to exchange. The idea is to implement transaction tracking similar to the regulations which currently apply to banks  
  
With part of the Bitcoin network regulated as heavily as banks, there is likely to be pressure to ban (or discourage, at least) any transactions which are not covered by tracking regulations. This could lead to exchanges refusing to receive or send coins from/to individual users' wallets  
Then there will be a network of people transacting privately, unable to use exchanges, and separate a network of sheep, happy to abandon their privacy and comply with transaction tracking rules in return for the convenience of using exchanges

You're missing the Merkle tree root hash. This is calculated by building a binary tree of transaction hashes. This is important because its existence in the block header ensures that the block's transactions can not be tampered with after the block is mined  
The first transaction in every block is for paying the block reward. It contains a money output, the block reward payment. It also contains a non-money output, using the OP_RETURN script command. The contents of the OP_RETURN output can be any arbitrary string of 40 bytes. Mining pools typically use the OP_RETURN output to store a code identifying the mining pool, a code identifying the individual miner's pool member ID, and a string of bytes containing a random value  
The nonce is small - only four billion values - so the miner finds a random number to include in the OP_RETURN output, and changes this random number every time the nonce values are exhausted  
This small change to the OP_RETURN output of the first transaction causes the transaction's hash to change, which then causes the Merkle tree root hash to change  
Using this mechanism to randomly vary the Merkle tree root hash enables the miner to keep hashing without repeating the same four billion hash calculations

You have to send your transaction to a Bitcoin node, either directly or via a SPV server. That node knows your IP address. If the operator of that node does not keep records of every IP address for every incoming transaction, then there is no record. Nothing prevents spies - Chainalysis, FBI, NSA, GCHQ - from running Bitcoin nodes  
In 2012, it became known that the NSA has installed interception and recording equipment in several Internet routing exchanges in cooperating countries. This equipment records raw Internet traffic as it passes through the exchange, storing as much traffic as possible on as many disk drives as the NSA can install at these exchanges. The NSA's purpose for this data collection is mass surveillance. When security agencies discover a new terrorism suspect, they can get warrants to intercept communications relevant to that person. But historical communications are not available. By collecting masses of Internet traffic belonging to all the innocent Internet users of the world, they have retrospective access to old data  
This NSA program was the trigger which drove the encryption-everywhere campaign, which has since encouraged more than 99% of Web sites to switch to https only  
Bitcoin traffic is not encrypted. The NSA has a raw data dump on a HDD somewhere which contains all your Bitcoin transactions and the IP address you used to broadcast each transaction  
There is insufficient oversight of the NSA to prevent it from using its raw Internet traffic archives to spy on innocent people. The NSA is known to cooperate with the CIA in using intercepted communications of innocent people to corruptly influence public officials in foreign governments to force policy changes favourable to USA foreign policy and military policy

Mouse jiggles are pseudo-random. Keyboard typing rates and mouse activity are very insecure in a cryptographic sense. They are useful as inputs to entropy, but only in combination with other activity which is more random  


.  


This is nonsense. Most wallets use the entropy generators available in each operating system. Hashing the current time has been obsolete since before Netscape invented SSL 25 years ago  
Do you understand how your operating system generates entropy? Do you know the difference between blocking and unblocking entropy sources? Do tiny computers such as the Ledger and Trezor devices have adequate entropy generators? How do they work? Would it be better to plug a hardware entropy source into your PC? How do these work? Even if you have one, do you know if your operating system has the ability to use the hardware device instead of it's usual entropy sources?  
This is a deep and complicated issue. If you search bitcointalk.org (for example) for discussions about randomness and entropy, most concerns are dismissed with "It is cryptographically secure because it 


  
If you want to go deeper than this, you should ask your operating system developer to disclose their method of creating entropy. It is a lot more than mouse wiggles and keyboard keystroke timing measurement, at least on Linux  
Then there's a separate debate, hotly contested, which questions whether an app running in a Javascript framework has sufficient access to your operating system's entropy generator

Bitcoin Core still has a message signing function  
The simplest approach would be to copy the C++ code for message signing and verification from Core and make your minor changes  
OpenSSL expects to read keys in ASN.1 format  
Make a key:  
    openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -pkeyopt ec_param_enc:named_curve -outform pem -out ecdsa.pem  
The key:  
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----  
    MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgZa5q6NrWzR6B56mI  
    waDL9Fi8nCOII+hwnkqTehbebPqhRANCAAStY0pj0OIu/1JsTe1c2EoVaKs5pG3R  
    JPTLxHD/1/lKSIwwmC4mlrrVFRy6+iptnqFVGQSL180xvrN6Vq21zyok  
    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----  
Use asn1parse to peek inside:  
    openssl asn1parse &lt; ecdsa.pem  
    0:d=0  hl=3 l= 135 cons: SEQUENCE          
    3:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim: INTEGER           :00  
    6:d=1  hl=2 l=  19 cons: SEQUENCE  
    8:d=2  hl=2 l=   7 prim: OBJECT            :id-ecPublicKey  
    17:d=2  hl=2 l=   8 prim: OBJECT            :prime256v1  
    27:d=1  hl=2 l= 109 prim: OCTET STRING      [HEX DUMP]:306B020101042065AE6AE8DAD6CD1E81E7A988C1A0CBF458BC9C238823E8709E4A937A16DE6CFAA14403420004AD634A63D0E22EFF526C4DED5CD84A1568AB39A46DD124F4CBC470FFD7F94A488C30982E2696BAD5151CBAFA2A6D9EA15519048BD7CD31BEB37A56ADB5CF2A24  
That's helpful, and there are better ASN.1 parsers available which display the 32-byte private key and the 65-byte public key separately, and display the byte values of the meta data fields  
Now, to the question. We have a bunch of 32-byte private keys stored in a Bitcoin wallet and we would like to put them into ASN.1 format so we can use openssl commands to sign a message with a wallet key and then verify the message signature  
This appears to be possible, but it is impossible to find examples. This discussion:  
  
suggests using the -genconf option with "openssl asn1parse". This makes asn1parse into a builder of ASN.1 files, as well as a parser. You still have work to do, to work out the correct values for each element of the genconf file. If it works as claimed, you should be able to convert a Bitcoin private key into the correct format for using openssl to sign messages

Not possible  
Bitcoin only links each transaction input to the transaction output being spent  
The inputs in a Bitcoin transaction are not linked to the outputs of the same transaction  
Any transaction with many inputs has that many paths back. A transaction with 20 inputs has 20 paths back. If a transaction somewhere in each of those 20 paths also has 20 inputs, then there are 400 paths back. No accurate traces are possible

Bitcoin transactions are slow to confirm because there are a lot of transactions and the blocks are full  
BCash blocks are empty because it has no transactions, nobody uses it  
Is this a difficult choice for you?  


This one is funny  
I avoid but some of their trolls indulged in a troll thread here a few hours ago,  
so I browsed through some of the trolls' recent comments in threads  
It seems they're annoyed at miners for switching to Bitcoin instead of BCash. Oscillating hashrates have ended, presumably because there was a BCash hard fork to modify the BCash EDA algorithm. Certain people are surprised and disappointed that miners chose Bitcoin instead of BCash after the oscillation strategy became unviable  
And this resentment towards miners somehow links to the idea that Bitcoin mining uses too much energy  
The term "clutching at straws" seems to have been invented for this strange set of non-issues  
Also, there are a few comments expressing disappointment that many (80%) miners signaled SegWit2X support for months, and are still mining Bitcoin today. Not sure of the logic, because it's hard to see how the SegWit2X failure can be blamed on miners

Precise: miners are competing to be the first one to find a block which has a header which has a double-hash SHA2-256 hash value lower than the current target hash  


The nonce is only a 32-bit integer. Even an old Antminer S9 will cycle through the entire range of nonce values more than 3000 times every second  
Yes, you read some "how mining works" page and it says miners vary the nonce until a miner finds a value which wins the block. These articles are out of date  
Every block has 80-bytes at the beginning - the block header. The block header has several data elements which make it a summary of the contents of the block. It also contains the hash of the previous block and it contains the nonce. The block's transactions are represented by the Merkle tree root hash  
Every time the nonce values have been exhausted, the miner makes a small change to the first transaction in the block. This causes the transaction hash to change, which in turn causes the Merkle tree root hash to change. Then the miner tests all the four billion nonce values again  
The 80-byte header is double-hashed with SHA2-256. If the result is less than the current target hash, the miner wins  
The target hash is automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks. The elapsed time for the most recent 2016 blocks is compared with 20160 minutes. If faster, then the target is reduced to make it harder to find blocks. If slower, then the target is increased to make it easier to find blocks. The automatic adjustment is a mechanism for keeping the average block interval close to 10 minutes, as the global mining hash rate increases or decreases from time to time

This happens, but not very often. Mostly, a node does not delete unconfirmed transactions until its mempool is full or the transaction is more than 2 weeks old. Mining pool nodes (probably) have more memory for holding bigger mempools, so if your unconfirmed transaction is still in a mining pool's node it is likely to be confirmed in a near-future block. Blocks do occasionally fill up and create a backlog of unconfirmed transactions, but this rarely lasts for more than a few days. The 14-day default mempool expiry gives plenty of time for confirmation  
The obvious exception is the block congestion period in December 2017 - January 2018  
Just for fun ...  
A miner can include any unconfirmed transaction he knows about, even a transaction which expired from mempools many years earlier. To do this, a miner would need to maintain a personal historical archive of unconfirmed transactions, because the transactions do not exist in the Bitcoin network after expiring from all mempools. Then, the miner can only include unconfirmed transactions whose inputs are still all unspent  
Miners are not known to keep years-old unconfirmed transactions in personal archives, but there are reports of mempool-expired transactions being included in blocks after 4-6 weeks. In January 2018, there was at least one block which contained only expired transactions  
The point is that it is **not mandatory** for miners to choose transactions from the mempool  
And the more obscure point is that if you ignore an old unconfirmed transaction, there is a chance that it could be mined many years later  
To avoid such a surprise, spend one of the transaction inputs in a "send-to-self" transaction. This makes the old, unconfirmed transaction invalid forever

Less complex, but similar cost, would be to use thermoelectric semiconductors to convert heat directly into electricity. These are also about 5% efficient, and expensive  
  
Despite being very inefficient, thermoelectric generation is ideal where the "no moving parts" simplicity is an important requirement

This depends. If mining pools choose all the transactions for all the pool members' blocks, and if there are only a few mining pools, then mining pools have too much power  
If some mining pools allow pool members to choose some of their transactions, then the power is less concentrated  
If all miners choose their own transactions, reducing the pool's role to measuring members' "shares" and distributing the block rewards, then there is no concentration of power. This is the future, if miners choose to implement it

The mortgage derivative fraud failed when a large number of mortgage bundle contracts matured in the same week and could not be refinanced

Except that if you restore a Core wallet from its original backup, you won't have a record of the transactions. The transactions are on the Blockchain, of course, but Core will take many hours to rescan the Blockchain  
And, a pruned node can not rescan, needs to be rebuilt from scratch to recover the wallet's transactions  
Not essential to backup frequently, but inconvenient to wait hours for a rescan, more inconvenient when you can't rescan if your node is pruned

Coinbase is bigger  
USD deposits are insured  
All the other failure modes are the same as Mt Gox  
No coins were stolen at Mt Gox  
They were lost in a failed arbitrage trade  
Mt Gox was the principal source of exchange rates  
They exploited this position to manipulate their published exchange rates and create an artificial arbitrage opportunity  
They used their customers' coins to trade this false arbitrage margin for their own profit  
When the price moved in the wrong direction for a couple of days the arbitrage trades in progress at the time all failed. Mt Gox never recovered those trading losses  
Fraud, yes  
Stolen coins, no  
Different risks apply to Coinbase. At least the market is now large enough to have multiple independent sources of exchange rates  
The most likely risk with Coinbase is that a run on Coin withdrawals will exceed their Coin liquidity

Exactly, and this is not an ATM issue. Every merchant accepting Bitcoin should have an automatic refund process.

No, the "entire block" is not hashed. The block header is hashed. Adding new transactions requires recalculating the Merkle root hash in the block header. The Merkle root hash has to be recalculated every 4 billion hashes anyway. This is an opportunity to add new transactions at the same time

Many wallets refuse to support importing private keys,  
are HD only, especially the mobile wallets  
Core and Electrum wallets support importing private keys  
There are a lot of warnings about this  
Heed the warnings, or lose a lot of money  
I always import, and never sweep, and never use HD wallets  
My keys were created separately from my wallet software,  
and are backed up using conventional backup techniques - encryption + DVD-R + multiple copies  
**The main warnings**  
If you import a key into a HD wallet  
and then later recreate the HD wallet from seed words,  
then you lose the imported key, you lose the money on that key's address  
If you import a key from another wallet, especially from a paper wallet, then you are exposed to theft if someone finds the key in the old wallet or printed on the paper  
If you import a key someone gave you (to save fees), then that person can steal the coins back from you if they have kept a copy of the key  
**Instructions here:**  
  
Even these instructions are worded to dissuade you from importing keys  
Other wallets: Coinomi, Mycelium, Guarda, etc only support HD wallets, refuse to import keys - for your own safety  
And a special mention for Bither, the wallet with no documentation  
Bither has an option to import a private key, but the key has to be pre-formatted into a format known only to Bither, and not documented anywhere

In a sense (indirectly), it is limited to 4 tx/sec by design  
The transaction throughput limit is a by-product of the design which keeps Bitcoin working  
preventing the block global propagation time from exceeding the block interval  
keeping the number of nodes reasonably high,  
ensuring node decentralisation  
It will change, not significantly, possibly 7-10  
after full SegWit adoption, and Schnorr signatures  
Keeping Bitcoin working is more important than all the loudest squealing about confirmation times and transaction throughput limits  
The only sensible way to have more than 10 tx/sec is for people to spread their transactions around multiple currencies  
Note that Litecoin and Dogecoin are now more than 4 years old and running very well

Why does it matter, if they have the same value?  
Nobody is claiming that so-called tainted coins have less value  
To date, tainting only affects the behaviour of a limited set of participants. If you move a coin from an online casino into a Coinbase account, Coinbase will refuse to provide you with services in the future. They let you keep your tainted coin  
Arguably, Bitcoin is fungible in spite of tainting, because the value of tainted coins does not suffer. Coinbase's services are prejudiced by tainting, in the same way PayPal's services are prejudiced against selling online pornography

I like this  
But I would also like my wallet to tell me how many small-value or "dust" coins I have, and then display a list, and offer to let me add one or two of them to each transaction  
This would tidy up the small-value coins "as you go" and avoid the need for a consolidation (or "defrag") transaction

so I might still end up having to consolidate later,

OK, a paper wallet rendered to PDF instead of printing  
I guess you then import the key from the PDF into the wallet and make a transaction  
Specifically for this method  
* USB flash drives are unreliable, subject to complete failure  
* PDF is a file format often used as a vector for malware  
But let's say your QR codes are in PNG format,  
and saved on a DVD-R instead  


Two advantages  
Your cold wallet has only one key and one address  
Your ledger has unlimited keys  
It takes maybe 5-10 minutes longer to make a transaction from a stored cold wallet than from a Ledger  


No, unless you value the 5-10 minutes lost time  
I'm storing 1000 private keys on a DVD-R and using Electrum on an offline computer to sign my transactions  
Every time I need to spend Bitcoin, I copy the keys I'm using for this transaction from the DVD into Electrum and ...   
more detail in the official instructions  
  
This method is more secure and more convenient for my usage,  
and worth the 15 minutes fiddle time  
I don't have a Trezor or Ledger

No, the 2-hour graph does not  
Because it is only a map of the amount of fees in the accumulation of unconfirmed transactions,  
it really only tells you which block of transactions yours will fall into if you choose a particular fee  
If you were checking the 2-hour graph several times every day for weeks,  
you'd get familiar with the patterns which support quicker confirmation times for each fee range  
Otherwise, the 1-week graph is more informative  
especially now, since the recent change is significant  
I prefer this:   
The direction of the fuzzy red line is informative  
but I suspect the actual estimates for &lt;= 2 blocks (or 48 or 144) are a bit high

I also have Electrum on a phone,

could be a few dollars, could be hundreds  
If the price is acceptable, insert cash

Not equivalent to a Bitcoin node hard fork  
In Bitcoin, the developers do not tell the node operators when to upgrade  
Instead the developers offer code changes, and the node operators, individually and en masse, decide whether the change is beneficial to Bitcoin  
This process makes node decentralisation  
* good, because it prevents unwise changes being implemented  
* or bad, if it prevents beneficial changes  
Of course the distinction between unwise and beneficial is subjective, and the node voting mechanism is the method for choosing

You're looking for a complicated answer when the real answer is simple and has already been given  


Not important  
Wallets are secondary to Bitcoin  
If you own Bitcoins, it's because there is a transaction on the Blockchain and you own the address of one of the outputs of that transaction  
Every block is a collection of transactions selected by a miner. When he assembles a collection of unconfirmed transactions into a block at the beginning of a mining period, he adds an extra zero-input transaction as the first transaction in the block, with the address being his address, and the amount being the mining reward plus the sum of all the fees  
When the block is confirmed, all the transactions get appended to the Blockchain  
It is just a transaction on the Blockchain, the same as the other 2000+ transactions in the block except that  
* it is the first transaction in the block  
* it has no inputs  
Most recent example:

Requirements planning comes before purchase  
Tip: not SSD VPS, rent a HDD VPS, cheaper, and minimum size is typically 1TB  
There's a Lithuanian provider I like for these VPS plans, EUR10 per month for 2TB and 2GB RAM  
Then again, run your node at home like most Bitcoin node operators  


No, the Bitcoin Blockchain only grows at 1 block every 10 minutes, forever  


Not forseeable  
Currently less than 200GB  
Current standard desktop HDD is 2TB for $60  
$6 cost for storing Blockchain, trivial


No  
Are there plans to tackle this problem?
Read the documentation about running a node  
There is an option to prune the node to fit any hard disk space,  
right down to 2GB minimum  
Also, the Bitcoin origin document (Section 6) describes a different pruning method, removing obsolete (fully spent) transactions from their blocks  
When implemented this pruning will keep the Blockchain size to about 30GB, growing slowly over time,  
according to the growth in the number of unspent coins  
There are no current plans to implement Satoshi Section 6 pruning,  
but there is nothing stopping any developer from coding it independently and operating pruned nodes in the current Bitcoin node network

This is answered clearly at the top of the privacy page  


Some basics:  
The Blockchain records the Bitcoin address of every transaction output  
Unless you reveal your Bitcoin addresses, nobody knows which transactions are yours. There are many ways in which people expose their Bitcoin addresses. This is why the privacy page is long  
The OP of this thread asked about IP addresses. The NSA probably knows Satoshi's IP addresses, but the ISPs and university networks who own those IP addresses probably do not have records from 2008-2010 to link the IP addresses to the person using them at that time. Satoshi used an anonymity provider to register bitcoin.org in 2008 - anonymousspeech.com. They accept cash by mail  


This depends on your requirements. For example, I run a Bitcoin node which means I want port forwarding from my VPN provider. AirVPN offers port forwarding. NordVPN does not. Also, Nord is overrated  
Most importantly, follow the annual VPN survey at TorrentFreak. Be very careful not to sign up with the VPNs which are missing from this survey - especially HideMyAss and PureVPN, who have a known history of revealing their customers' details  
  
My personal preferences are AirVPN and AzireVPN. Based on the recommendations of other people - Mullvad and TorGuard  
And just because there is always a McDonalds, the biggest and most popular is PIA, well recommended by most of their customers

This is where your logic fails  
Fragmentation is self-limiting,  
because every input in every transaction is spent to zero  
Bitcoin never has partial spends  
And then every large multi-input transaction only needs 2 outputs, 1 to recipient, 1 to sender's change address  
Every transaction with more inputs than outputs reduces the total number of unspent coins, automatically limiting total fragmentation

Not necessarily  
Node decentralisation is about making it impossible for node operators to conspire to alter the Blockchain  
Strictly, only one node is needed, provided the operator is honest  
In reality, honesty in humans is unpredictable, a question of psychology,  
so the optimum number of nodes is the number required to ensure that  
* there is no practical possibility for all node operators to be dishonest or, 
* if they are all dishonest, the logistics of conspiracy are extremely impractical  
Since this is an issue of human psychology,  
there is no way to calculate an optimum number  
but for the sake of safety, more is better  
Node location is important to protect against location-specific outage events  
but the primary protection offered by decentralisation is against tampering with the ledger

They chose to store their bitcoins on an exchange  
If their Bitcoin was worth $500 when Mt Gox failed, then they only lost $500  
The Trustee sent them $500, their losses are fully restored  
Now there are still some unsold Mt Gox bitcoins. In February 2019 we will be told how the Trustee intends to distribute them. He can't keep them for himself. It would be sensible to distribute the bitcoins direct to the claimaints without selling them first  
Either way, the claimants recovered more than they lost  
This should be a warning to all the people who think Coinbase is a safe place to store bitcoins

Depending on how tight or loose your definition of offline, some of these steps will be manual. If offline means no electronic link between offline computer and online computer, then moving the unsigned transaction to offline, and moving the signed transaction to online are both manual operations. The signing operation can be mostly automatic, the operator presses a button  
If the computers can communicate with laser or infrared or by flashing QR images on a screen and capturing them with a camera, then zero manual effort. But if an offline computer responds to QR codes on an online computer's monitor, it it really offline? Yes, there is an airgap, but the monitor &lt;-&gt; camera link is still hackable

You're all overreacting. Luke is making a good technical point. If nodes accept all blocks at the same height, and then an orphan branch grows, then the amount of work required to follow the correct branch is much less. Just clip the orphan branch and continue with the valid branch. The current process requires nodes to clip the orphan branch then rebuild the missing branch by fetching and validating the missing blocks
Considering the larger goal, encouraging full nodes, the comments here assume that the current bottlenecks in running a full node are not fixable, and this is justification for using SPV  
If a full node with all blocks could be initialised in 5 minutes, and use less than 20GB disk space, there is no reason for SPV  
This can be done. Unfortunately, nobody is currently working on it

If you have Bitcoin in your own wallet when a new Bitcoin fork creates a windfall of new coins, then you own those coins. To spend the forkcoins  
*    there has to be an exchange buying the forkcoins  
*    you have to install a forkcoin wallet

No, the S9 is now obsolete, replaced by more efficient, higher hashrate devices - S17, T17. This means miners are selling their S9 devices below their lowest 2018 retail prices - the manufacturer was selling S9 for $400 in mid-2018, after pricing them above $2500 in Feb 2018. I see they are now selling S9 again, under $400  
The new miners are always sold out, and never discounted  
This applies to Bitmain and the competitor manufacturers  
This includes S9  
Because miners are dumping their S9 devices, they are available second-hand for $150, possibly less. If purchase price is your main buying criteria, this is the only bargain to consider  


A second-hand S9 is not new, so you should plan to do some maintenance yourself, and buy more than you need, so you have spare boards  
Be aware that as more miners get delivery of T17 and S17, the global hash rate will increase, and will reach a point where S9 miners will not be viable. It's hard to predict when this will happen, because it depends on the Bitcoin price and on the delivery capacity of Bitmain and their competitors (currently always sold out)  
It would be risky to pay $350 for a new S9 for end-June delivery

No, the cost of energy is proportional to the mining difficulty  
Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty so that blocks are mined 600 seconds apart  
Lower profitability -&gt; fewer miners -&gt; lower difficulty -&gt; cheaper energy  
Bitcoin mining reaches an automatic equilibrium of small-margin profitability because it self-adjusts the mining difficulty to keep the block interval at 600 seconds  
And then, before the block reward falls to zero, all the greedy miners will be gone and will be replaced by altruistic miners, there will be enough miners to keep Bitcoin working, and so few miners that energy use will be inconsequential

Bitcoin does not **need** to keep rewarding miners  


Difficulty only increases when the global hash rate increases  


Nothing to do with human nature. The software uses integers. There are no integers between zero and one  


None, when you're counting with integers  
There are no decimals in Bitcoin. The amount stored in a transaction output is an integer count of Satoshis

The first transaction in every block has zero inputs  
This is the reward transaction, also referred to as "coinbase"  
Every miner puts the address of their own pool in that transaction  
(or their own address, if they are a solo miner)  
That's how the winning miner's pool receives the reward

Not purposely  
Incompetently  
The reason is simple. Bitcoin mining is deliberately designed to be a diminishing return activity. As more hash power joins the network, the mining difficulty adjusts upwards automatically, paying fewer and fewer Satoshis per terahash. Every time Bitmain sells a S9 miner, they reduce the profitability of every S9 miner already sold, and every S9 miner not yet sold

Yes they do  
For a while miners just used the algorithm in the Core software, highest fees get priority  
Now they all have their own algorithms,  
Not sure of the details, but they seem to have some priority for fees, some priority for older transactions, some degree of randomness, and maybe some allowance for size  
Also, at least 3 pools have an "accelerator", a Web page where you can enter a transaction ID for quicker confirmation  
One of these accelerators is free, requires the fee to be at least 10 Sat / byte, and accepts a limited number of transactions  
The other 2 accelerators charge high fees for entering your transaction ID  
As long as the accelerator is accepting transactions, a neat strategy is to send a transaction with 10 Sat / byte fee (usually around $0.20 - $0.30), immediately enter the transaction ID into the pool's accelerator, and then it gets confirmed the next time that pool mines a block  


None of these things is important  
Propagation time is important after a block is mined, not before

@_date: 2018-09-06 10:24:48
Probably not, in the current economics of Bitcoin mining  
Bitcoin miners are profitable where electricity is available for less than 8 cents per kW-hour  
Generally this means new power plants which have been constructed in anticipation of future electricity demand. Coal-fired generators (mainly in China) need to operate at a minimum level of production while waiting for the anticipated demand to emerge. In the absence of current demand, the output of these plants is available for heavily discounted rates. It would be more expensive to shut down the generator, wait for demand to grow, and then recommission the generator, than to sell a minimum level of electricity generation at less than the production cost  
These generators are producing carbon dioxide just because they have been built and commissioned. Selling the output to Bitcoin miners does not increase carbon dioxide emissions  
This assumes that miners do not draw more electricity than the minimum production level of these generators. It is possible that badly written supply contracts might allow miners to buy more than the minimum power at the same discount rate, forcing increasing losses on the generator and higher carbon dioxide emissions  
In other places - Iceland, Quebec Province, Washington State - the power is generated from non-carbon sources, ie geothermal and hydroelectric. The same market conditions apply. There is a temporary excess of supply due to the scale of new generators being built in anticipation of future demand, for a generator lifetime of many decades

It is also necessary to check  
*    that each input is spending an output from an older transaction  
*    that the output being spent has not previously been spent  
The first is easy, and it's necessary to find the outputs so you know the input amounts - there is no amount field stored in a transaction input  
The second part, preventing double spends, is hard, because you have to rely on the UTXO database. A double spend is detected by the fact that there is no entry in the UTXO database. The UTXO was deleted from the DB when the output was spent previously  
What if there was a bug, in Core or in LevelDB, which caused a UTXO to remain in the UTXO database after being spent? This would be a much more serious consensus failure than having duplicate inputs in a single transaction (CVE-2018-17144)

and more importantly, the followup discussion which is a kind of Q&amp;A to clarify the detail  
  
A brief passing mention about appealing to libertarians:  
  
which also implicitly predicts the capacity constraints which keep Bitcoin small  
Scronty's story, largely fictional, is also informative:  
  
In this version, the use-case was online casinos,  
and the problem is that fraudulent chargebacks are legal  
Amercians are banned by law from online casinos  
This law is partially enforced though mandating Visa to refuse payment services to American gamblers using online casinos  
Amercian gamblers then, can use their Visa cards at online casinos,  
lose badly,  
the use the anti-gambling law to justify reclaiming all their losses through a chargeback  
The origin paper (Introduction) does not refer directly to online gambling  
but does describe a similar issue  
Centralised payment systems are subject to regulation  
of a type which forces them to censor certain payment types  
(In the case of the Wikileaks payment boycott by Visa,  
censorship is a result of political interference, not regulation)  
As Satoshi points out, a consumer can bypass payment censorship by using cash, but because cash is impractical for online transactions  


Bitcoin fills that gap, is a cash analogue for online transactions  
Satoshi's Introduction proclaims the benefit to the consumer, a new means of bypassing payment censorship,  
but in the online casino use case, the main beneficiary is the casino, now freed from the financial penalty of legally sanctioned fraudulent chargebacks  


Unlikely  
Bitcoin is designed to be self-perpetuating  
It is an inter-operation of various mechanisms  
and parameters which have been chosen or tweaked, by luck or by precise calculation or by careful tuning  
It is self-balancing and finely balanced  
The same parameters which keep Bitcoin perpetually running and self-balancing,  
also limit its capacity to process transactions  
The capacity is very low  
The use of credit cards and similar payment services will eventually be banned for online transactions, because the risks of exposing secret numbers on the network are too high, and will soon lead to liability claims against large merchants and against payment providers like Visa and PayPal  
The liability risks are too high to insure against, and so the days of credit card payments on the Internet will end  
Bitcoin is not big enough to fill this gap  
But since the issue is avoiding the exposure of secret numbers for payment tokens, the solution does not require a decentralised currency, it only requires transactions which are cryptographically signed by the purchaser off-network  
Yes, Bitcoin has other uses, and yes this appeals to various libertarian and anarchist fantasies. Those are just fantasies  
Law enforcers may soon find that the investigation technique colloquially called "follow the money" will become less available. They'll have to rely on more traditional techniques

The winning miner is the first to calculate a hash which is less than the current target  
  
Difficulty is inversely proportional to target  
difficulty = difficulty_1_target / current_target  
That is, as the target gets smaller, the difficulty of finding a hash smaller than the target gets higher  
  




You already answered this  




If the difficulty is not adjusted, then more miners will cause the blocks to be found faster than 10 minutes, and less miners will cause the blocks to be found slower than 10 minutes  




Because the mining reward started at 5,000,000,000 Satoshis per block and is reduced by half every 210,000 blocks. After 32 halvings, the reward will be 1 Satoshi. You can not have half a Satoshi, so after 33 halvings, the reward will be zero  
The total number of bitcoins mined will be 210,000 * 50 + 210,000 * 25 etc, and this adds up to just less than 21 million

The reason for high fees is that transaction senders choose high fees  
The reason for long confirmation times is that blocks are full  
When Bitcoin blocks are full, choose a good alt coin which has empty blocks  
This leads to fewer Bitcoin transactions, Bitcoin blocks with spare space, low confirmation times, low fees

Using Amazon pricing is not accurate, especially for the period before February 2018. Bitmain sells Antminers direct to customers. Amazon sellers were buying retail from Bitmain. Until the end of January 2018, Antminers were sold out, with 6 week delivery delay. This created a secondary market, where resellers could pay retail price ($1500 in December 2017), wait for delivery, then exploit the supply shortage to resell at a profit. The $3000 Amazon prices your article quotes are only in this reseller market  
In anticipation of continued demand growth, Bitmain increased prices to about $2300 at the end of January (with a 3-week delivery promise). Less than 2 weeks later, the price was reduced to $1500, with instant delivery. The market turned from excess demand to excess supply. Prices have continued to fall since February - currently the S9 price is under $400. The leaked financials claim a break-even price for the S9 Antminer at about $534  
The comments about R&amp;D investment are misleading. Bitmain has no serious competitors. The competing manufacturers are always sold out and are only marginally faster than the Antminer S9  
A more important issue with R&amp;D in this marketplace is that the products can never produce enough profit to repay the R&amp;D investment. Bitcoin mining was deliberately designed as a diminishing return activity - as the hash rate increases, the mining difficulty parameter automatically increases, causing the Satoshi-per-terahash reward to decrease. For most of 2017, this diminishing return was masked by increasing Bitcoin exchange rate prices  
Arguably, Bitmain's near-monopoly as an ASIC mining manufacturer is only a result of the price increase from $400 to $16000 from 2015 to 2017. The free ride is over

The most sensible claim is that Satoshi never owned more than 50 Bitcoin  
The claims by so-called experts that he owns hundreds of thousands or a million Bitcoin are proven false  
Nobody knows which unspent coins belong to Satoshi  
Your proposal only works if you "block" (or expire) all unspent coins after they get to some defined age - maybe 50 years  
Change the consensus rules so that an unsigned transaction is valid if it spends coins which are more than 50 years old, and spends the coins to "burn addresses". There are already algorithms for creating an address from a random bitstring (instead of from a public key which was created from a private key). Alternatively make the transaction valid if it has no outputs. This makes the expired, unspent coins get donated to miners as windfall transaction fees

It is impossible to tell whether a coin is lost or is being saved for a long time  
If you want to reclaim old, unspent coins, then you will be stealing coins from long-term savers. Nobody in Bitcoin will let you do this  
If you think this is an important principle, you should launch a new cryptocurrency, with an expiration period for unspent coins, and a method for reclaiming them. The technical details are simple. There was a discussion here some time in 2017 suggesting that any unspent coins more than 100 years old can be spent in a transaction with zero outputs. That is, change consensus rules so that an unsigned transaction is valid if all its inputs are more than 100 years old, and it has zero outputs. The "zero outputs" means that the inputs become transaction fees, and get donated to the miner, a very neat way to use the existing fee mechanism to reclaim expired coins  
This is not my idea. I can't find the old thread, so I can't credit the original author  
It's a good idea, but not for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a hoarders' coin. The hoarders won't let you expire/reclaim their old coins, even after 100 years

Business conditions changed in January. Bitmain produced too many Antminers at the same time the demand fell  


This is probably true, unless the higher price, combined with continuing Bitcoin price falls, frightens away all the purchasers. The choice is between  
*    continue to make a loss selling Antminers below cost  
*    raise the price and risk destroying the sales, and never having the cash to pay for the unsold stockpile of Antminers  
I'd be optimistic for Q4 2019 onwards, assuming the IPO goes ahead, and the public owners replace the board and management immediately. Bitmain's market position is dominant, near-monopoly. The competitors are still 3-5 years away from manufacturing sufficient volume to properly compete

This can be alleviated by storing data off-chain, on Usenet or some free cloud service, and then using a Blockchain to store a small message hash  
I'm storing encrypted data this way now, without the Blockchain part. Not sure whether Blockchain as a timestamping tool adds any value to this use case  


That's the whole purpose of asymmetric encryption. The sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the message's symmetric encryption key. PGP, and now OpenPGP/GnuPG have been doing this for decades  
The recipient uses his asymmetric private key to decrypt the symmetric key, then decrypts the message with the symmetric key. GnuPG and similar software do these two steps automatically, without exposing the symmetric key directly  
Also https, which creates ephemeral symmetric keys using the asymmetric keys of both parties - See Diffie-Hellman  


This one is easy. Use a Bitcoin address. Then the recipient only needs to operate a Bitcoin wallet which knows when a new message exists for any of its addresses. Using "Bitcoin" generically here, not proposing to clog up the actual Bitcoin Blockchain with non-financial messages  


It depends  
This is a standard discussion in asymmetric encryption. Why not use public key encryption for the whole message? There are at least three answers  
*    Most important: Asymmetric encryption is very slow, therefore it should only be used for small "messages". Symmetric encryption is fast. The standard method is to encrypt the message symmetrically, then encrypt the symmetric key asymmetrically (with the recipient's public key). If the message is really short - less than the size of a symmetric key - then it could be viable to encrypt the message directly with the recipient's asymmetric public key  
*    A corollary to the previous bullet: if there are multiple recipients, it makes sense to symmetrically encrypt the message once, and then asymmetrically encrypt the symmetric key with each recipient's public key. This uses less space than making multiple encrypted copies of the message. Again, this depends on the size of the message. I work with encrypted documents 100MB - 1000MB in size. If you're sending tweets, "ur l8" "sry b there soon", maybe it's OK to asymmetrically encrypt the messages (but see below)  
*    Very important: Asymmetric encryption is potentially vulnerable to mathematical analysis if it is used with large messages, or if a key is used multiple times with the same message. Restricting its use to encrypting symmetric encryption keys avoids these risks  
These things are easy where there is one sender and one recipient. More interesting - multi-user channels where every message is end-to-end encrypted. The many-to-many key-exchange problems are challenging

Check all the transactions in your wallet to list the coins and their addresses as at the date of each fork  
Check the blockchain explorer Web sites for each coin and enter the Bitcoin addresses from your lists  
If you have any coins waiting to be claimed on one of the chain forks, then  
Install a wallet which supports the fork coin  
Use a crypto -&gt; crypto exchange to convert the fork coins to Bitcoins  
Repeat for each fork

Generally, people don't move/copy the same wallet from device to device and wallet software is written with the assumption that the wallet will stay on one device. Wallet software developers expect you to have different keys on different devices, and to move your bitcoins from device to device by sending transactions to yourself

I don't remember this, but I only followed the story in Everybody here was thoroughly well informed, with the same question repeated for weeks before and after the fork - how do I sell my free Bitcoin Cash to get my bonus?  
On the other hand, the fork was expected to drive the Bitcoin price down, because of the airdrop aspect. The price dipped about $150 on the day, then climbed, just another example that the Bitcoin exchange rate price is not a rational market. Any analysis of the price changes in early August 2017 is complicated by the political issues of SegWit, Bitcoin Cash, and the Bitcoin Cash airdrop, as well as the ongoing controversies of the New York Agreement and ASIC boost

Good questions  
For detailed answers from the experts see the bitcointalk discussion    


Yes  


Complicated. Somebody did see the bug, reported it, and then it was patched. You probably mean "no hostile actor saw the bug". It's likely that if the vulnerability was found by a hostile and then exploited, their activity would have been noticed quickly. There is a small chance that it could have been exploited quietly for long enough to permanently destroy trust in the Bitcoin Blockchain. Greg Maxwell's comments in the bitcointalk thread include a list of reasons for why an exploit would have been noticed fairly quickly  


Likely. All useful software has undiscovered bugs. Perfection is unattainable in this field  


Vetting code isn't the best way to discover bugs, for reasons of psychology - a coder will often see what he believes the code is supposed to do, and miss a bug  
The most important process currently in place is testing  
Again, refer to Greg Maxwell's comments in the bitcointalk thread, about the current testing processes, about how they can be improved, and the barriers to achieving a better testing regime. Greg's comments about this issue are the most perceptive that I have ever read about software testing

This is false. Unless blocks are full, the same number of transactions get verified. There may be a temporary increase in the time between blocks

You can not use the xprv in OpenSSL because it is not a wallet key. It is a derivation root for generating all your wallet's private keys, past, present and future. These techniques for deriving deterministic key sets from a root were invented for Bitcoin. General-purpose cryptography software like OpenSSL and GnuPG have no support  
But that's not so important. Your wallet will give you a list of its private keys, and you can use any one of them to sign a message using OpenSSL  
You will need to convert from Base58Check WIF format to hexadecimal using your wallet, or using an app like bitcoin-tool  
and then convert the hexadecimal format to one of the standard key formats accepted by OpenSSL  
Some clues here:  
  
Your starting point is different - an existing private key (keys). The link discusses a new key generated from random  
Lots of work. Why do it?  
Also, there are some similar discussions on stackexchange (I think). The most important point in those discussions is that you are degrading the security of your keys by using Bitcoin keys as general purpose message signing keys  
Afterthought  
Yes you could sign messages with your xprv using OpenSSL, but why would you? And again, even more importantly, exposing your xprv by using for any any other purpose than as a key derivation root will risk losing much Bitcoin  
Then if you sign with your xprv, is the xpub technically suitable for signature verification - it probably is, in some format. But you have to expose the xpub to your message recipient for signature verification. This rings all the privacy warning bells

I don't mind discussing net neutrality on the facts,  
but unfortunately the net neutrality campaign sent a group of ignorant Redditors on an astroturfing campaign  
IMO, they harmed their cause by spreading fact-free FUD for a few weeks  
in several subreddits including Also, the facts have been thoroughly discussed here in the past  
The Bitcoin protocol:  
(ignoring SPV for simplicity)  
Communicates transactions from wallets to nodes  
Communicates blocks from nodes to other nodes  
Nodes listen on port 8333  
Bitcoin traffic is not encrypted, unless the node operator has chosen to hide his node using the Tor network  
Node IP addresses are public, except those using Tor  
Net neutrality:  
The principle that an ISP is a common carrier and carries all traffic regardless of content, also does not inspect traffic to analyse content  
Analogy: The postal service does not open your mail and charge a higher price for job applications or love letters, nor does it censor letters based on content, nor does it delay delivery based on content. All letters are delivered unopened and treated equally  
Postal workers who interfere with mail are subject to prosecution, heavy fines and prison terms  
Why do ISPs object to net neutrality?  
Common carrier status makes the ISP business a commodity business, the simple provision of network capacity and interconnection  
Commodity means low margins  
They desire to sell added value on their networks for additional fees,  
specifically to exploit profit opportunities by providing entertainment content  
The ISPs may decide to allocate guaranteed bandwidth for these value-added entertainment broadcasts (watch the Kardashians with no buffering!),  
and throttle regular bandwidth in order to deliver that guarantee - at the risk of a flood of customer complaints  
Does this affect Bitcoin? No  
Is there any risk to Bitcoin?  
Technically, Bitcoin is vulnerable to blocking or throttled bandwidth because it is mostly not encrypted, because the node IP addresses are not secret, and because the network port it uses is hard-coded  
However, there is no commercial incentive to block or throttle Bitcoin  
Some have suggested that banks might conspire to pay ISPs to strangle Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a threat to their own businesses  
This suggestion borders on paranoia  
Is there a political incentive to strangle Bitcoin?  
Yes, but this discussion is outside the scope of the net neutrality issue  
Are there technical improvements which would protect Bitcoin from blocking or throttling?  
Yes, the same improvements now accepted as normal all over the Internet, since Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA is recording all the Internet traffic they can fit on hard drives using interception equipment installed at several major Internet transit exchanges in Europe  
1. Encrypt all traffic  
1. Use VPN services (or Tor) to obscure node IP addresses  
1. Implement the bittorrent principle of node discovery - communicate port number and IP address across the node network, instead of just IP address, remove the reliance on hard-coded port 8333  
Encryption of all traffic is the most important measure for all Internet users to avoid negative anti-neutrality practices  
Encryption prevents the ISP seeing the content,  
prevents analysis of network protocols,  
makes all traffic look the same  
The universal use of encryption makes the network neutral,  
even after the regulator abandons its consumer and social responsibility  
Coming soon to Bitcoin - BIP151 end to end encryption

Interesting question  
Coinbase has been doing this for a long time for transactions internal to Coinbase  
Nicehash is very small, but a first step to greater exchange &lt;-&gt; exchange off-chain cooperation  
In a sense, it's a de facto second-layer, driven by the current block congestion situation  
It's good because it relieves the transaction pressure on the main network  
It's bad because the transactions are off-chain, they lose the protection that derives from the immutability of the Blockchain as a ledger. Off-chain transactions are not protected against tampering or errors  
It only matters to people who use exchanges  
The often repeated advice here - if you don't control the keys, they're not your coins - means that using an exchange is a risk, because the exchange's coins are on the Blockchain, but your coins (on deposit in the exchange) are only entries in the exchange's secret ledger

According to the OP's scenario, a conspiracy of 70% of miners can be organised through twitter, which means only the other 30% of miners will be mining the regular transactions  
LOL, this has so many holes  
**EDIT**  
Just realised this is stating the obvious,  
because the fantasy scenario has the 70% mining some other coin  
I mean, it would be more effective for the 70% to stay on the main chain and mine their spam transactions  
Otherwise the spam transactions serve no purpose, and can be quickly identified and deleted from any node's mempool by the node operators - as if they never existed

Or neither, but with a similar dichotomy  
As already discussed, Bitcoin is suffering capacity constraints, so the decentralised side of the question is more likely to be satisfied by an ecosystem of many separate currencies - Dogecoin and Litecoin already mentioned, then multiply these 3 by 1000 
I suggest the same on the centralised side: AmazonCoin, VisaCoin, PayPalCoin, GoogleCoin, USDCoin  
A multiplicity of centrally controlled coins,  
because there is no real cost benefit in sharing a common infrastructure  
Then you're asking "who wins?"  
Do all the centralised currencies get destroyed by boycott campaigns?  
Or do the sheep meekly accept the payment censorship and send their Wikileaks donations as cash by mail

Seriously, Bitcoin addresses are designed for copy and paste

so a double-click copy is not going to be truncated by a '+' or '/' as with base64

If you thought that, then your OP could have been titled "some questions about confirmation delays"

Fees are a diversion, a non-issue  
Miners don't reject transactions with low fees, instead they select with a high-fee bias,  
and some other criteria which vary from pool to pool

as long as the fee is at least 10 Sat / byte

The catch is this:  
The calculators have multiple inputs,  
most of which were discovered on Bitcoin data sites
Mining difficulty and price are the two most sensitive inputs  
Most first-time miners get burned when difficulty suddenly increases 300% in a few weeks  
Profit turns to loss  
Price might go down

The most important part missing is the one-way nature of a cryptographic hashing algorithm, and how this prevents modification of the data, and then how this property is inherited all the way up the tree  
Inherited, because the leaf hashes protect the data from modification, and then the lower branch hashes are hashes of the leaf hashes, then the branch hashes above that are hashes of pairs of branch hashes below them  
It's complicated, and you're trying to simplify the picture by omitting the most important part, removing the explanation completely, making the diagram useless

Bitcoin is one of thousands of similar cryptocurrencies

a price somewhere between $1 and $2

The Blockchain is distributed around the Internet on several thousand nodes  
Each node has a full copy of the Blockchain  
This is one of the components of Bitcoin which prevents the ledger being corruptly manipulated  
Every new block has to be propagated to every node  
Every node needs to verify the transactions in the block before propagating the block to its neighbour nodes  
10 minutes is a time buffer to ensure that each block is fully propagated to thousands of nodes before the next block is mined. Without this time buffer there is a risk of a bottleneck (creating new blocks faster than they can be propagated), from which Bitcoin might never recover

This would be great  
Let the Bitcoin Core wallet work with the option to nominate the IP address of your node instead of downloading the Blockchain  
Many wallet functions are already available with the -noconnect option. It would be neat to have a nowallet Blockchain Core instance and a wallet-only instance, running separately  
Like the other guy said, Electrum is one way to achieve this, but as you implied, it's a bloated way to achieve it  
Armory is a less bloated solution, because it integrates more directly with the Core Blockchain. But then you're using the Armory client, and it would be better to have the option to use the Core client

All the technology we need for zero fossil fuel is available now or requires a small amount of engineering research  
Cost prevents the technology being implemented for 100% of world energy  
The breakthrough required is in mass psychology, to break the world's dollar worship  
For example, all the world's gas and liquid fuel could be supplied by a few large plants using concentrated solar heat and catalytic conversion to extract carbon dioxide from seawater and convert it to methane, and then to convert methane to longer chain alkanes as required for vehicle fuel  
Look at a map of the earth, locate the large coastal deserts, build the energy plants  
But nobody has the courage to fund the economic analysis required to calculate the world-scale per-barrel cost of this method of renewable hydrocarbon production, because if it's more than $200 per barrel, then the economic disruption would be too great

You can easily lose the coins on the imported key  
Most wallets now are HD wallets, where a list of seed words is used to create a set of keys. If you lose your phone or your wallet, you can use the seed words to recreate the wallet on a new phone  
If you import a key into a wallet, then lose the wallet, then use your seed words to recreate the wallet, the imported key will be lost. If you have a separate backup of the imported key, then you can import it again. If you don't backup the imported key, you lose the coins on that key's address

It's easy to avoid accumulating dust  
Spend all your UTXOs in every transaction

Do this every transaction, and you'll hardly ever have more than 3 UTXOs in your wallet, and none of them should be dust
@_date: 2018-09-19 01:28:21
The Core wallet functions are designed to access the Core Blockchain and UTXO database and indexes locally  
The same applies to Armory  
It would be possible to re-write the wallet functions to access an external Core instance. I would also add authentication to prevent random external clients accessing your node  
This would require a lot of coding work  
Running your own Electrum server alongside your Core node could be simpler  


No, not this  
The bitcoin-cli commands connect to the node using a RPC network connection. If you want to operate your wallet remotely, develop a client which sends RPC requests to the node  
Same result, cleaner implementation

No, it just needs half the miners to retire  
Then the mining difficulty automatically adjusts to account for the reduced mining hashrate

The ATM operator can automatically refund, but not to the sending address, for the reasons you describe  
The ATM should be asking the customer to supply a refund address, as a normal part of the transaction process  
Every online merchant should do the same, to avoid the labour overheads of manually handling every glitch, and to provide competent customer service  


Actually they are, if the ATM operator follows standard single-use address principles. Choose a fresh address for every incoming transaction, and the receiving address functions as a unique identifier for that transaction. Even so, refund is only possible if the customer's refund address is also recorded by the ATM before the transaction is sent

Good question. With BIP39 HD wallets, you can always rebuild the full key list just by entering the seed words into the wallet. You don't need to store all the private keys  
The Bitcoin Core wallet uses BIP32 HD key derivation. It has no seed words. This wallet requires you to keep a backup. Even so, you do not need to backup all the private keys because the first key is the seed, and the wallet can always recover any missing keys from any backup which contains the seed key. The advantage of HD is that you don't need to remember to run regular backups, because the first backup will always contain the seed key

You should pre-order 10 Antminer S9 today for delivery in January 2018  
Then when they're all sold out again  
sell them on eBay for double their retail price

This will happen when the price bubble bursts. The price will fall to about $1.15. Fees will be near-zero as they are now. It would be interesting to see if there are retired miners popping onto the network to play 51% attack with their aging S9 Antminers. What if they competed against each other to double-spend? Only one miner can win each block  
This scenario is technically possible, but unlikely. If it actually happens, it could be fixed with an emergency hard fork to change the hashing algorithm - make all the retired miners obsolete
@_date: 2018-09-26 06:14:57
The mining contracts in the marketplace today have a single upfront payment, and nominal service fees. They also have a clause allowing the miner to cancel the contract if it becomes unprofitable. Typically this means that you invest 1000, pay 5 per month fees, mine for 6 to 8 months, earn 600 and then the contract ends  
In the butterflylabs days (and they were not the most ethical operator) you could pay a fee per Ghash/sec per month. Then, depending on fiat exchange price and mining difficulty, you would make a small profit or a small loss for each month  
Yes, I would pay per hash, a day at a time  
No, I would not buy any of the existing cloud mining contracts, unless I had a really good reason to buy $600 worth of Bitcoin for $1035

Bitcoin is useful, primarily for the purpose described in the Introduction of the origin document  
  


Credit card users are banned from certain types of transactions  
For example it is unlawful for an online casino to serve American customers  
In the physical world, if I can't use a Visa card to buy a Nazi uniform or a copy of the Anarchist's Cookbook, I can pay cash  
On the Internet, cash transactions are impractical  
Bitcoin was designed to fill that gap  
It is analogous to cash, for online transactions  
The early use of Bitcoin's value was probably a small number of new online casinos  
and then other types of "cash sales" trading  
[Silk Road]( was made famous by this 2011 article:

Every megawatt of renewable allocated to Bitcoin mining is a megawatt of renewable not allocated to productive uses of energy  
Since the productive demand for energy (industrial, commerical, residential) is not discretionary, a megawatt of renewable energy used by Bitcoin mining has to be supplemented by a megawatt of fossil fuel energy  
Even using renewable energy for Bitcoin mining increases the burning of coal

Because the seed is a single point of theft risk for the entire key set - all future keys  
Because most HD wallets only create a small set of keys. I see some discussion about default keypool size being increased from 100 to 10000 in the Core BIP32 wallet  
I guess I can set the keypool to 10 million, save the 10 million keys onto DVD-R, then delete the seed to eliminate the theft risk, but that would be more work than my current process

Not really, it's a valid concern  
Looking at it from the other side for a moment, this is the reason the UTXO exists in a database, to determine that the TXO has not been previously spent, that it is still a UTXO  
It would be too slow to scan the entire Blockchain to prove that a TXO is not spent, so the UTXO database provides a fast lookup to prove that the TXO is still a UTXO  
The direct answer to your question is given in the other comments, it's too slow to read the entire Blockchain to prove that the UTXO database is accurate  
The other answer is that the UTXO database is initially built (on a new node) by processing every transaction in the Blockchain. In this sense, it is a consensus rule. But this takes hours, days or weeks, depending on the CPU power of the node

Ask your IT consultant to verify that the signature matches the public key, and that each public key matches its address. If they all match, then the borrower has proven that he controls the private keys which allow him to spend the funds at the corresponding addresses

That's not how Bitcoin works  
The history of the Blockchain contains many unspent coins  
If you received bitcoins in 2016 and you have not spent them, then every node has to include the 2016 transaction which holds your unspent coin, and also the block which contains that transaction. If you prune all year-2016 blocks from the Blockchain, then you lose your bitcoins  
It is possible to prune transactions from their blocks, if all the transaction's outputs have been spent. Satoshi specified this transaction pruning method in his [white paper]( Section 7 Reclaiming Disk Space  
This work has not yet been done. Anybody could develop the code whenever they want. It will be done before the Blockchain becomes too big, probably when it gets to 1TB, possibly sooner, depending on other issues  
Meanwhile storage is not an issue. The hardware cost of storing the Blockchain is about $4. The bandwidth cost is insignificant, because only **new** nodes have to download the full Blockchain, only once

Shiller's analysis has the same faults as most of the Bitcoin hype sprayed all over this subreddit. It assigns revolutionary purpose to Bitcoin. It equates the Bitcoin price with its success  
Bitcoin fills a gap  
In-person purchasers can choose to purchase with cash. Before Bitcoin, Internet purchasers could only use centralised payment processors - credit card, PayPal, and others. These centralised processors are owned by corporations, but are small targets for regulatory interference, and political interference. Bitcoin is analagous to cash, is free from outside interference. It enables Internet transactions which are blocked by centralised payment systems  
This function of Bitcoin does not care what the price is. It has no relationship to hoarding Bitcoins, or to price speculation. It is immune to interference, but is not revolutionary  
Bitcoin will not replace fiat currency. This does not make it a failure  
Bitcoin's price will fall. This does not make it a failure

But a coalition of western allies can impose and enforce trade embargoes, as they have threatened many times in recent decades, and have effectively destroyed banking secrecy in those few countries which were profiting from it - Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and a variety of small States known as tax and banking havens  
Referring back to the suggestion about on-ramps and off-ramps, this is already happening to a degree. Exchanges are heavily regulated for KYC compliance. Localbitcoins sellers in America are being sent to prison after high-profile trials, about 5 of them now. Russian authorities have seized Bitcoin ATMs with no justification  
Bitcoin was designed to be P2P. Exchanges are an aberration. As more regulation is imposed on exchanges, more and more people will just switch to buying from friends, as happened in the early days of Bitcoin  
Then there might be a coordinated multi-State (USA, Europe, China) response to ban Bitcoin at the personal level. If this ban takes the same form as the banning of bank secrecy, it could eventually turn into a world-wide ban, enforced by USA threat diplomacy. It would take 10-20 years

This is false. Bitcoin transactions are not linked a a trail. The only links are from every transaction input back to the output of an older transaction which is being spent  
**The outputs of a Bitcoin transaction are not linked to the inputs of the same transaction**  
Simple transactions - one input, one or two outputs - appear to link the outputs to the inputs of the same transaction. Bitcoin spies (so-called chain analysts) use these links to de-anonymise Bitcoin transactions  
Defeating chain analysis only requires creating transactions with multiple inputs. A transaction with 10 inputs has 10 paths back to older transactions. If the older transactions have 10 inputs, then there are 100 paths, 100 equally possible origins for the outputs of the starting transaction

OK  
The time to initialise a new node is much greater than the download time of the Blockchain. This is because the Core software builds the UTXO database and indexes as it downloads. These processes are very slow - slower or faster depending mostly on CPU power. If I install the Blockchain, I avoid the download time, but not the UTXO+index build. The Blockchain is less than 200GB, so even on a slow 1.4Mbyte/sec ADSL connection, I can download it all in 40 hours  
As someone else mentioned in another comment, the developers enhanced the node initialisation process a couple of years ago, so that downloading and UTXO build happen in parallel - the build does not have to wait for the download. This means that downloading first then initialising, is slower than just running the initialisation. This is why the developers stopped providing the bootstrap download  
Sorry, got diverted. Back to the question ...  
The chainstate directory contains the UTXO and indexes. When I download from  the UTXO and indexes are in the update.torrent, so I don't have to wait 3 weeks to have them built  


You could host bootstrap and chainstate as separate downloads  
Or host the chainstate, and provide instructions for using a third-party tool for downloading the Blockchain - if there is anything like this, maybe the SX utilities if they're still available

Learn how Bitcoin works, understand the interaction, the interdependence between the components. Understand that Bitcoin is trusted because its networked operation is designed to prevent human interference, without requiring users to trust any human  
Find a weakness in this design. Break the trust  
A two-year plan  
Slowly implement full Bitcoin nodes all over the world. Make sure they are not using cloud or VPS services. They have to be indistinguishable from other Bitcoin nodes. The target count is 40,000 new nodes  
Hire software auditors to find bugs. Keep them secret. The bugs have to be the kind which corrupt the transaction ledger undetectably - adding extra value to the database though double spending, or spending non-existent coins, or increasing coin amounts. Inject transactions which exploit the bugs. Keep it secret. Do this for as long as possible until somebody notices. By then the ledger will be so corrupt that Bitcoin will be useless  
Then watch the emergency response. The software will be patched, and there will be some attempt to neutralise the damaged data  
Now, you have 40,000 nodes and the community has about 9,000 nodes. Your nodes refuse to accept the software change. Bitcoin closes down  
This plan has a high chance of failure. It requires ledger corruption buried deep in the Blockchain before the errors are discovered. Also, it is possible that the community could implement a network fork to exclude nodes which do not comply with the software fork. The appropriate bugs may not exist  
Even then, destroy Bitcoin and everybody shrugs, patches the equivalent bug in Litecoin, and life goes on

There's no puzzle  
The digital signature functions of asymmetric cryptography are mathematical techniques  
*    a private-public key pair is created  
*    the public key is published  
*    later, a private key is used to sign a message  
*    the public key can be used to prove that the message was signed by the person who created the key pair  
    *        this is where the magic is, the signature proof "puzzle"  
  
Bitcoin varies from the above. It hashes the public key to an address, and publishes the address, then defers publishing the public key until the coin is spent  
In the Bitcoin context, wallet software automatically creates key pairs and addresses, and automatically signs every spending transaction. A Bitcoin wallet used regularly for online shopping will eventually have a few hundred addresses, and one key pair for each address  
A coin is a single transaction output. It contains an address and an amount  
The owner of a coin is the person who possesses the private key for the address of the coin  
A transaction input contains the transaction ID and output number of the coin it is spending, and the public key for the address of the coin  
A transaction has one (or more) signatures for each input  
Each signature proves that the signer owns the private key which matches the public key in a transaction input. Hashing the public key to an address  proves that the address on the coin matches the public key in the transaction input  


Not the recipient. Every node in the Bitcoin node network verifies every transaction in each new block. When the Bitcoin nodes append a new block to the Blockchain, the recipient has a new coin to spend

Ask Antonopolous  
I can't agree with his choice of words  
Your post asked about cryptography  
My comments respond to the cryptography parts  
Bitcoin transactions contain tiny pieces of executable code using a scripting language developed by Satoshi specifically for Bitcoin  
I have avoided discussing this part, so far  
Your Antonopolous quote discusses Bitcoin scripts and cryptography and uses dumbed-down language (puzzle) to avoid discussing these in detail, avoids separating the signature verification from the execution of the script  
It's not accurate to describe Script as cryptographic  
Script itself is not cryptographic. It is a simple list of instructions, executed left to right. Some of the instruction codes invoke cryptographic functions - signature verification, SHA-256 hashing, RIPE-160 hashing  
If you want to learn about the scripting part of Bitcoin, you have to read something else  
  
  
Script is the part which supports different types of Bitcoin addresses,  multi-signature addresses, and more  
For every question you can ask about Bitcoin transaction signing and signature verification, you can ask another 5 questions about the role of Bitcoin Script. It's a deep rabbit hole

This is false  
There is no "21 million" in any Bitcoin node software. The 21 million limit is derived by the zero point in the block reward after 33 halvings. The block reward decreases from 50 bitcoins to 1 satoshi after 32 halvings. The amount field in every transaction output is an integer count of satoshis. 1 satoshi is the smallest possible amount. After the 33rd halving the reward reduces from 1 satoshi to 0. There are no half-satoshis  


This is false. Perhaps there is a different, more complicated way to increase the supply. Suggesting that it is as simple as changing "21" to "22" is ridiculous
@_date: 2018-08-31 03:04:22
There's a potential scenario where miners (pool managers - because they run nodes) could collude to modify the consensus rules, have their blocks rejected by all the non-mining nodes, then the non-mining nodes never get new blocks, therefore the miners can claim that they control the Blockchain because the "legacy Blockchain" is no longer appending new blocks  
In reality, Bitcoin only needs one miner following the correct consensus rules to create new blocks, and a 100% collusion of even the heavily centralised mining pools appears to be near impossible anyway  
The most that could happen in this scenario is that some rogue miners would mine with new rules and pass the new blocks around their own nodes to create a fork chain, and Bitcoin would continue as normal, without the rogue miners. The rogue miners' fork chain may have a short life, or may exist for a year or more like BCash, with nearly zero independent nodes, and Reddit trolls claiming that non-mining nodes have no power so who needs them anyway

BCash has nearly zero transactions  
So obviously the blocks are empty,  
confirmations are instant,  
fees are low  
BCash also has nearly zero nodes,  
so it is centralised, compared to Bitcoin,  
possibly subject to corrupt manipulation of its blockchain  
BCash has bigger blocks, a disincentive to node operators,  
hence more centralisation  
As it gets more popular, the blocks will start to fill  
then the nodes will not be fast enough to propagate each block before the next one is mined

The Core node software already has a list of checkpoints  
It also has an option called "assumevalid" which avoids the need for a new node to verify every block. Unless the node operator overrides the "assumevalid" configuration, a new node will only verify most recent blocks  The current value for assumevalid is block 534292  
A new node today will verify just under 7000 blocks  
A new node still has to process the entire Blockchain to build the UTXO database. This is slow

Every node has a "mempool" of unverified transactions  
When your Bitcoin wallet software broadcasts a new transaction, it sends it to the nearest node (or your own node, if you run a node). That node sends it to other nodes. The network is well connected, so after a few seconds nearly all the nodes have your new transaction in their mempools  


Yes  
When blocks are not full, most miners will have mostly the same transactions. This is why most transactions are confirmed in 1-2 blocks  
All Bitcoin miners are in pools. Miners do not select their own transactions for the block they are mining. They are given the block by their pool manager. The pool manager can change the contents of the pool members' block at any time  
Except ...  
P2Pool allows miners to choose transactions for the blocks they are mining  
A new mining protocol called BetterHash will soon be available so that more miners can join more pools which allow individual miners to choose transactions for their own blocks  
  


The miner (or mining pool manager) just creates a new block from transactions which are still in the mempool. Transactions do not get removed from a node's mempool until after the block has been propagated. Obviously a miner will avoid mining the transactions which are in the most recently mined block

Arguably, the claimants are only due to receive the fiat value of their lost bitcoins, using the valuation at the bankruptcy date. Price changes since 2014 mean that this is a lot less than the current value of the 200000 Bitcoin. A good lawyer would argue that the Mt Gox users get about $300 million to $400 million, and the remaining assets belong to the shareholders of the bankrupt corporation, which would make Mark Karpeles an instant billionaire (almost)  
This does not look likely, since the bankruptcy liquidation was replaced by civil rehabilitation in June 2018. We'll know more in February 2019

Either way, if you can list all the keys in both wallets, then you can also list all the transactions for all the keys

An address should only have one UTXO  
  
If some fool has multiple UTXOs with the same address, they are still separate UTXOs. UTXOs should be selected for transaction input according to how their amounts add up to the spending amount. Most wallets try to minimise the number of transaction inputs, but this leaves a lot of dust UTXOs behind, then eventually a transaction has to spend all the dust  
Whatever strategy a wallet has for choosing UTXOs as inputs, there should be an option for the user to override the wallet's choice and choose their own list. A knowledgeable user will add one or two dust inputs to every transaction, if fees are low enough to justify the extra transaction size. This keeps the dust level manageable

OK  
This is very old economics. Money is an abstract number which enables disparate products and services to have a common basis for valuation, to avoid having to estimate thousands of values for every product in terms of the value of every other product - the barter valuation nightmare  


Bitcoin is more than just blockchain  
And the important feature of Bitcoin is that its payments can not be censored  
Immutability is part of the trust mechanism which ensures that a transaction ledger can exist without human audit controls. This is necessary to enable the ledger to exist as thousands of decentralised copies on the network, which in turn is necessary to prevent censorship by regulators, political pressure and other interference which are imposed on centralised processors  
Blockchain, immutability, decentralised ledger, mining proof-of-work, all these only exist to serve the fundamental requirement - resistance to payment censorship  
There is tangible value - very small - to the extent that Bitcoin enables transactions which would otherwise be banned. The value is the value of the additional economic activity enabled by "unbanning" those transactions  
As you suggest, this value is not exclusive to Bitcoin itself, but shared between all the Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies which use a similar mechanism to defeat payment censorship

First, the scam issue. When BCash forked, it inherited the pre-existing history of the Bitcoin Blockchain. The same applies to BGold and 5 or 6 other forks since. Duplicating value by inheriting the original chain is fraudulent  
In contrast, when Litecoin and Dogecoin started up, they forked the software but started fresh blockchains from genesis  
The biggest weakness of BCash is centralisation of nodes. Bitcoin has about 9000 non-mining nodes properly connected to the network. BCash has fewer, but it is commonly understood that nearly all the BCash nodes are cloned servers on Amazon AWS and Alibaba, all controlled by about 5 people  
The rhetoric:  
If we remove Roger Ver and his paid shills from the community, BCash is just a fork created by the ABC developer group - probably with a few hundred miners and a few dozen honestly-operated nodes  
Unfortunately, the participation of Ver and Co brings a huge amount of dishonesty - the claim that BCash isn't a fork, but is actually the original Bitcoin, the claim that non-mining nodes have no consensus role, the claim that decentralisation is not necessary, and a variety of brainless spoiler claims about SegWit, high fees, BCash is Satoshi's "original vision", and the evil BlockStream corporation

I suggest Rusty is missing the point about decentralisation  
The purpose of Bitcoin's decentralised node network is to prevent the type of payment censorship we see with Visa and PayPal - the giant blacklist of prohibited transactions  


I agree with this  
It is already a potential issue for BCash. Every morning I expect to wake to headlines that Amazon and Alibaba have colluded to force BCash to ban donations to the EFF  


Trusted actors means PayPal and Visa. The circle turns back to the beginning. Centralised control means that there is a small target for regulatory and political interference to impose censorship - giant ban lists  
If there is a concern that decentralised consensus is a risk to Bitcoin, we should be looking at the potential for a single (currently unknown) software bug to shut down a node (and by extension, all nodes). Bitcoin would stop  
Bitcoin has been affected by software bugs in the past, and they have been dealt with by urgent action, and cooperation from the node network. The last time this happened, Bitcoin was much smaller than it is today  
Today, it would be impossible to make an urgent announcement on bitcointalk.org and instantly receive the cooperation of the entire node network. There is a high probability that a bug could not be fixed, simply because most node operators would be unaware of the problem for days or weeks  


I challenge this  
This applies to some mining, mainly where recently built hydroelectric infrastructure has a demand shortfall  
The more common picture is this:  
  
As China modernises and industrialises its economy, new power stations are constantly being commissioned. Nearly all of them are fueled with coal. Every new generator has a period where demand is insufficient to soak up the minimum supply of the generator - excess power is available for near zero tariffs  
It is these low power prices which attract Bitcoin miners  
Most Bitcoin mining is powered by burning coal  
Some outside-the-box observations ...  
I've always had the impression that rewarding miners with coinbase was an afterthought, a line of least resistance for answering "how do we issue coins?". Unfortunately, this afterthought has turned Bitcoin mining into a multi-billion dollar industry, and is responsible for the common misconception that mining is the most important component of Bitcoin  
With 9 years experience behind us, it would be interesting to read new suggestions for different ways of issuing cryptocurrency in a decentralised blockchain system - not issuing the entire coin stock at genesis, and not rewarding miners

    openssl sha256 -binary public_key.bin &gt; public_key.sha256

I have 1000 genuine requirements to transact online without a centralised payment processor. Satoshi solved that problem.

Your coin tosses have to be a raw binary bitstring before you hash  
You are hashing an ASCII text string containing 256 '0' and '1' characters  
You should be hashing a bitstring containing 256 bits  
I can't find any way to do this in one step, so here is a way to convert your ASCII '0' and '1' string to hexadecimal, and then convert the hexadecimal to raw binary ...  
    coin_toss_ascii=00101010001110011011000111011100111101100010010010010111101000101010011101101100100011110110111010001111111011100011000101101100  
    # dc is a calculator, here we're using it to convert from base-2 to base-16  
    dc -e "16o 2i $coin_toss_ascii n" &gt; coin_toss.hex  
    # xxd is a hex browser, the -r option makes it work in reverse, converts hex to binary  
    xxd -p -r coin_toss.hex &gt; coin_toss.bin  
    # this step is optional, helps to check that the binary file matches the original coin tosses  
    xxd -b coin_toss.bin  
    # sha256 hash  
    openssl sha256 -binary coin_toss.bin &gt; coin_toss.sha256  
    # convert to hexadecimal  
    xxd -p -u -c32 coin_toss.sha256

The broad answer is everything on the PayPal ban list, published on their site  
Bans include subscriptions to Usenet services, donations to Usenet indexing sites, donations to a variety of file sharing sites - direct download file hosts, bittorrent and other methods  
Donations to many political activist organisations are banned because they promote political opinions outside the narrow range of what Western security services deem to be acceptable - Wikileaks, Edward Snowden and others  
Add to this any VPN, proxy, Web hosting services where you want to sign up anonymously, because you're using the service to enhance your privacy, to escape the gaze of the NSA and other security services. The NSA is now storing raw Internet traffic in bulk, by intercepting traffic at major international Internet exchanges, with no filtering, direct from fibre to hard disk. Many people choose to use VPN to remove their identity from their Internet traffic (and to encrypt it). If you use PayPal or Visa to pay for a VPN service, they will give your name to the NSA and FBI on request  
Outside the Western countries, several countries routinely monitor and censor Internet traffic - China, Iran, Egypt, Turkey. Especially China, where it is now illegal to use a VPN unless the VPN is approved by the State. People in these countries need an international VPN connection just to use the Internet properly, and they need to pay with Bitcoin so that the authorities can not identify their VPN use. Political dissidents have the same issues, but greater risks of punishment

Bitcoin is a safe method for online transactions because the purchaser's secret key never traverses the network. It stays on his computer. Only signed transactions are sent over the Internet. Contrast this to PayPal and Visa, which require you to send your secret numbers or login credentials across the Internet. PayPal and Visa could implement signed transactions or asymmetric cryptography for logins and Web shopping. They could have done this 20 years ago. Visa is already moving in this direction for their new mobile payments system. Eventually, litigation risk will force all payment providers to switch to a Bitcoin-like signed transaction technology. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is safer

Look very closely at your diagram  
The only link is from the input to the output it is spending  
The arrow points the wrong way  
Only one of the transactions in the diagram (TX6) has more than one input  
The diagram unrealistically links those two inputs back to TX2  
Even your toy diagram does not pretend to trace every output back to coinbase mining origins  
Look at real transactions in the mainnet Blockchain. There are transactions with hundreds of inputs  
In any case, what you're missing is that the link only goes one step, from the input to the output it is spending. You make the same mistake as many self-proclaimed experts. You think the inputs and outputs of a transaction are linked to each other. They are not  


It is impossible to track backwards from a transaction with many inputs. There are too many paths, and none of the paths have exact amounts to lead back to a precise coinbase origin  
Bitcoin nodes do not verify all the way back to coinbase. Bitcoin nodes validate that each block hash is correct and that each prev block hash matches the hash of the previous block. Today they don't even bother doing that. Search for the assumevalid parameter  
If you disable the assumevalid parameter, your node will verify the blocks all the way back to the genesis block  
Nothing can ever verify all transactions back to coinbase. That is a ludicrous fantasy  
A Satoshi pruned block will still have a verifiable hash. This is because  
*    the block hash is calculated from the block header  
*    the block header contains the Merkle root hash of the transaction hashes  
*    pruning fully spent transactions from the block does not change the Merkle tree  
So, after pruning, every block's hash remains unchanged, and the Blockchain verification process is exactly the same  


Pruned blocks  
I can serve them to other pruned nodes  
Eventually, the vast majority of nodes will be pruned. With a choice between waiting days for Blockchain initialisation and waiting less than an hour, most new nodes will choose the faster option  


People who have a need for full history will want to archive an unpruned Blockchain. Validating new blocks and the new transactions only requires keeping transactions which have one or more UTXOs, does not require full history  
Pruned and unpruned nodes can co-exist on the same network, with the restriction that unpruned nodes can reject pruned blocks sent by pruned nodes  
Satoshi pruning can be implemented without a hard fork. When someone finally develops it, it will be instantly popular, because of the huge time saving in the initialisation of a new node  
PS Your words "verify all the way back to the coinbase" imply that there is a single path back to coinbase for every TX output. As I said above, the permutations problem of millions of possible paths makes this a fantasy  
Maybe you're claiming that every new node validates the consensus rules of every transaction during initialisation. If this was true, then it would not suffer the permutations problem. In any case, it's not true. Blockchain initialisation proves the hashes of the transactions, and the hashes in the Block headers, but does not revalidate the consensus of every transaction because that would take years

Most likely, price will fall, some miners will leave, the hash rate falls, blocks are 13-15 minutes apart until the next difficulty adjustment, the next difficulty adjustment is delayed by 2-5 days, the difficulty falls ...  
Repeat, until the falling price stabilises

Every node downloads and processes the entire Blockchain. It (mostly) only needs to do this once. The processing involves building a handful of databases. It takes several hours, several days, or a few weeks, depending on how fast your computer is. There is a database containing all UTXO. There is another database containing all transactions for all the addresses in your wallet. These databases provide instant lookup without having to scan the entire Blockchain  
If you run an Electrum server, as well as a full node, you have even more index databases, much more useful than a node by itself. It can lookup the transaction history of any address, instantly  
A better explanation here:  
  


You could build a Merkle tree of all UTXO. It would not be very useful. UTXOs are deleted and created every time a transaction is confirmed. The UTXO database is not a verified transaction ledger. It is only a fast way to find a UTXO on the Blockchain. The Blockchain is the verified ledger  
The Merkle tree in a block has 2 purposes. As already mentioned by the Merkle root hash is one of the data elements used to calculate the block hash during mining  
The other purpose is to eventually implement Satoshi's Blockchain pruning method. Read Section 7:

No  
The role of cryptocurrency is limited to its original purpose - to be analogous to cash for online transactions  
Centralised third-party payment systems are constrained by their censorship practices. The list of products and services banned by Visa and PayPal is huge. In the meat world, these products and services are available by paying cash over the counter. On the network, Bitcoin serves as the equivalent of cash  
Long-term future:  
*    centralised third-party payment systems have a role, and they can learn from Bitcoin some methods to make payments more secure  
*    cash has a role, wherever centralised third-party payment systems are censoring transactions or where they are breaching their customers' privacy  
*    Bitcoin and other uncensorable cryptocurrencies have a role as cash analogues for network transactions

They are two completely different pruning processes  
Pruning in Core reads every block at initialisation, builds some index databases, builds the UTXO database, and deletes whole blocks as it proceeds  
It validates blocks beginning with the current "assumevalid" block height  
When initialisation is finished, only some hundreds of most recent blocks are stored on the node  
Satoshi's Section 7 describes something else  
*    delete transaction from its block after it is fully spent, and after its spending transactions are buried under enough blocks  
*    replace deleted transaction with its hash  
*    after Merkle-adjacent transaction pairs have been deleted, replace the pair of transaction hashes with their Merkle hash  
*    after Merkle-adjacent Merkle hashes have been deleted, replace the pair of Merkle hashes with their Merkle hash  
With this method, a block can still be validated because the block hash is calculated from the Merkle root hash, which never changes. Unlike Core pruning, every block remains in the pruned Blockchain  




The diagrams clearly show transactions disappearing from blocks
As mentioned in my previous comment, deleting fully spent transactions would make the node initialisation very fast, because the deleted, fully spent transactions no longer need to be processed to build the UTXO database  
Because the Core pruning method still reads and processes every transaction, and prunes blocks after they have been processed, it takes the same time to initialise a node as it takes to initialise an unpruned node

No  
There is no verifiable chain of ownership  
You can not verify accurately earlier than the UTXO which is being spent by a new transaction, except in the rare case where every transaction right back to coinbase has only one input. The Blockchain is not a historical chain of transactions  


Wrong  
The Satoshi pruning proposal only prunes fully spent transactions, as I already said, as it says clearly in the white paper. Fully spent transactions have no UTXO, no **unspent** outputs, only spent outputs

Why do you need tx history?  
A Bitcoin transaction only needs enough history to prove that a UTXO exists for each input, and that the input's public key matches the UTXO's address  
If you need tx history for your old, spent transactions, you'll have to keep your wallets backed up  
Nobody needs tx history for other people's addresses  
With the current pruning method, all blocks are read and processed, then most blocks are discarded. These pruned nodes are unable to serve any blocks to other nodes  
With Satoshi's pruning method, pruned nodes can serve all blocks, and most blocks will be pruned. If unpruned full nodes want full blocks, they will only be able to get them from other unpruned nodes  
Eventually the Blockchain will be too big to avoid pruning  


Many old blocks contain UTXOs. Pruning by block height means these UTXOs can not be served by the pruned node. Then you have to rely on an unpruned node to verify transactions  
Pruning fully spent transactions reduces the processing time a new node takes to build the UTXO database. Currently, every historical transaction output is added to the UTXO database and then deleted when its spending transaction is processed

Full details of the Willy bot operation are still undisclosed  
If you read Karpeles AMA here from a few months ago, he refuses to discuss it, because of ongoing legal action  
In the same AMA, he is using Vinnik as a scapegoat to continue to avoid admitting the losses are his own fault  
In the absence of full disclosure of the trading history of the Willy bot (and any other trading conducted by Mt Gox and Karpeles using customers' coins), it makes more sense to conclude that bad trades caused the losses, and that scapegoating a lone "Russian hacker" satisfies the public's hunger for blame  
The US Justice Dept has their own agenda, but it is important to note that Vinnik is not charged with any crime relating to the Mt Gox failure, not in the USA, nor Japan, nor Russia, nor France  
I suggest that the US Justice Dept's claims that Vinnik is responsible for theft from Mt Gox is a cheap publicity stunt, as they have only charged him with money laundering

The AI lab is just a handful of researchers in a tiny room somewhere, not a significant cost drain  
The BCash holdings might represent a significant loss in themselves, but they're only a small part of Bitmain's financial position  
Bitmain's fundamental business is a failure. In 2017, losing money because they failed to supply enough Antminers to meet demand, and now in 2018, having a huge oversupply because the demand collapsed just when they solved the supply problem  
Even their failure to develop a new SHA256 mining device is not important, because their monopoly remains unchallenged. There are two new competitors with a tiny supply volume who are always sold out  
And the global Bitcoin hash rate continues to climb, even as the Bitcoin price falls towards $4000. There's no future for Bitmain when the hashrate inevitably follows the price down

Bitcoin is not gold

In any case refer back to the OP. The current price of Bitcoin is the cause of the accelerating global hash rate, which is the cause of the excess energy consumption. My earlier comment presents the self-evident fact that if the price falls below $2, mining energy consumption falls to insignificant  
Attributing "store of value" to Bitcoin is fallacious rhetoric used to justify irrational price speculation. It's a lie dressed up as an attribute for the purpose of denying that the speculation bubble is an emperor with no clothes

No, as described in the document, you have 128 bits of entropy  
This is the randomness which makes your xprv key unguessable  
There are 2^11 (2048) words in the wordlist, so each word represents 11 bits  
12*11 = 132  
The checksum is 4 bits calculated by hashing the 128 bits, which gives you protection against some types of transcription errors. This is the purpose of the checksum, and justifies the extra complexity of using a checksum. The checksum is only 4 bits. Each word represents 11 bits, so the checksum is the first 4 bits of the first word

Block verification time has been optimised by holding a lot of transactions in RAM. This means that the most important consequence of block size increase is an increase in RAM requirement to run a node  
Faced with a choice between upgrading RAM (often this means a new computer for the node, not just plugging in an extra memory module) and retiring a Bitcoin node, some Bitcoin node operators will choose to shut down  
Previous discussions (and a research paper) have concluded that increasing the block size will cause a disproportionate loss of nodes, a more centralised node network  
The other issue, which is not covered by any graph, is that the block interval is a time buffer which allows nodes to reorganise after miners propagate orphan blocks

Miners ordered ASIC devices during the price boom, then waited 6 weeks for delivery. The price fell while they were waiting. In this situation a miner has 3 choices:  
1.    leave the device in the box, already depreciated by the price collapse and depreciating more by the day  
1.    sell the device into the secondary ASIC market  
1.    make a few Bitcoins at a loss and hope the price goes back up  
The continuing increase in the global hash rate indicates most miners chose the latter option. If the price continues to fall, it will eventually reach a point where more than half the miners will decide to retire at the same time, and dump their devices into the secondary market very cheap

A new node needs to know about at least one other node so that it can connect to the node network  
All nodes share the IP addresses and ports of all the nodes they are connected to  
After connecting to one node, a new node quickly learns all the nodes in the entire network  
The node saves all the nodes it learns, so it never needs to use the pre-configured DNS seeds more than once  


If all the pre-configured seeds were closed down, somebody would need to establish a communications channel to spread an alternative list for bootstrapping the connections of a new node

I think everything you need is here:  
  


For 12 words, entropy = 128 bits, checksum = 4 bits  
* generate the 128 bits with your dice throws  
* apply the SHA256 hash function to the 128 bits  
* the checksum is the first 4 bits of the SHA256 result  
* append the checksum to the end of the 128 bits  
Now you have 132 bits, which is 12 * 11-bit chunks. Every 11 bit value points to a word in the 2048-word word list  
To answer the question directly  
The checksum word is the last 7 bits of the 128 bits with the 4-bit checksum appended to it. This 11 bits is used to lookup the last word

Monitoring the log might be more productive. bitcoind is a very chatty logger  
Or more difficult, measure the network traffic, minute by minute  


It checks to see if it's already running, so a stalled bitcoind process would still be a stalled process, can not be replaced by a new process  
Also, would fail to start because the stalled process still owns the listening network port  
and, there's a risk of wallet corruption if you do manage to get 2 processes running at the same time

People are claiming the mining cost determines a price floor  
These people either do not understand that difficulty adjusts downward when the hash rate falls, or they do not understand that falling difficulty makes mining more profitable for the remaining miners  
They don't get that the mining difficulty adjustment is an automatic equilibrium  
Most discussions about price are distorted by the delusion that talking positively makes the price increase. The false belief that the mining cost creates a floor price is part of this delusion. The truth is not as important as the greed incentive to talk the price up

Could be useful for tipping small amounts to experienced Bitcoin users, to avoid fees. The amounts can be small enough to ignore the possibility of sender spend fraud  
Even then, there's a wrinkle. Nearly everybody (not me) is using HD wallets, and it's considered unwise to import a private key into a wallet. Since we're avoiding fees, the recipient can't sweep the tip into the wallet either - a sweep is an on-chain transaction, requires fees  
If someone sent me a tip as a private key, I'd import it into Electrum, and add it to the input list of my next spending transaction  
All my keys are imported, and backed up externally from Electrum. I don't do the BIP39 word list thing

I won't buy into the "identity" thing. That's just part of the propaganda used to justify the prevailing morality  
Otherwise:  
Your focus misses the fundamental issues. The USD is not fundamental. It is just money, and money is nothing more than an abstract - a tool to make markets convenient, to avoid the inconvenience of millions of permutations of cross-valuations in the barter economy  
You're looking for meaning. There is none  
Income is thousands of times higher than necessary to satisfy basic human needs - food, clothing, shelter. So the world built an economy to soak up the excess, and a psychology - the propaganda of marketing - to make everybody participate in this fake marketplace of frivolous luxury  
Millions of people are already outside this system, mostly not by choice. Especially in the USA, the millions are unemployed (but excluded from the official unemployment statistics) at home, supported by family, addicted to alcohol, prescription painkillers and sleeping pills, and now legal marijuana. They have been conditioned to believe that their situation is their own fault - everybody can succeed! - and their permanent drug and alcohol intoxication suppresses public dissent  
If you're serious about rebelling against this system, Bitcoin is a distraction. It will be embraced by and incorporated into the luxury economy

Delay the creation of new blocks so that all Bitcoin nodes have time to propagate each block, and so that nodes with orphan chain branches have time to reorganise their chains  


Miners do not need to be rewarded. For many years in the early history of Bitcoin, mining was a hobby which paid penny rewards  


Bitcoins do not have to be injected into the network by awarding them to miners. There are other options for creating new coins  


Double spending is not prevented by mining. It is prevented by Bitcoin nodes checking every transaction in every new block before adding a new block to the Blockchain  


A centralised cryptocurrency does not need to be mined  
Only decentralised cryptocurrencies are free from censorship by external forces - regulation and political interference  
To be decentralised, a cryptocurrency needs a large node network  
New blocks have to be delayed to ensure that the node network does not become irreversibly clogged  
Mining provides the delay which gives all nodes the time they need to keep their Blockchains synchronised

More chains ...  
I am monitoring Bitcoin block sizes and transaction volumes  
I am researching historical patterns in Bitcoin transaction volumes  
When the research is done, I will have a reliable method for predicting the next time Bitcoin blocks will become full, 6 months before it happens  
Six months before the next Bitcoin block congestion event, I will quietly launch a near-exact copy of Bitcoin. It will be called Laxcoin. It will have the minimum of software changes necessary to make it different to Bitcoin - different prefixes for addresses, for example. It will **NOT** inherit the existing Blockchain's history. It will be a fresh chain, with its own genesis block. There will be no big announcement, no publicity, but it will not be secret. There will be SPV wallets and SPV servers, and full node software available from day 1. I have already recruited a sufficient number of miners and node operators in advance  
Six months after Laxcoin is launched, Bitcoin blocks will fill. Instead of squealing about long confirmation times, and high fees; instead of squealing for Bitcoin developers to fix the scaling problem; everybody will say "Look there's Laxcoin, exactly the same as Bitcoin, except it has empty blocks"  
Instant scaling solution - double the block space with no software change

My previous comment was about hard forks  
Transaction censorship is possible, since it has no impact on consensus  
Apart from the obvious - selecting highest fee when blocks are full - there is no indication that this is happening. Your example - 1almkglor - is extreme, but does show that censorship is difficult anyway. If everybody practices "no address reuse", then there is little information in a transaction which would support any meaningful censorship. There doesn't seem to be any strategic value in censoring transactions by size, amount, number of inputs, number of outputs  
Nevertheless, as mentioned in another sub recently, the centralisation of mining pools opens the opportunity for censorship, and we can hope that the BetterHash mining protocol becomes widely adopted, so that transaction selection moves away from the pool manager and to the individual miner

Yes  
The validity of a block and all the block's transactions is checked by all the nodes in the node network, after the block is mined. If the block is invalid, or if the block contains any invalid transactions, then the block will be rejected by all the nodes, will not be appended to the Blockchain, and the miner will not receive the block reward. Therefore it is wise for the miner to verify all the transactions in his block, to ensure he gets paid his block reward  
Also, empty blocks are valid, and are mined quite often

It's very elegant, minimises the communication requirements between miners and pools, simply by nominating an appropriate difficulty number. The miner hashes a block which meets the pool difficulty level and sends the block to the pool manager "here is my new share". The number of blocks which satisfy the pool difficulty is a fair indicator of the hashes burned by that miner  
But any miner which is not powerful enough to mine "pool difficulty blocks" is never going to get paid

Not directly  
The cost of mining varies from miner to miner. As the price falls, miners with higher costs will choose to retire instead of mining at a loss. The global hash rate falls when some miners retire. Bitcoin mining difficulty falls automatically after the hash rate falls. The lower difficulty improves mining profitability for the miners who remain in the network  
The qualifier in all this is that the mining equipment market has a substantial delivery lag. Equipment purchase decisions are made at a particular price, then the price might fall before the equipment is delivered. Some miners will choose to mine at a loss when their equipment is delivered because they would lose more by leaving the equipment idle, or by selling their freshly delivered equipment into a saturated secondary equipment market  


No  
There is a similar argument from the perspective of an individual miner, that buying more hashing power is necessary to get a greater share. This argument fails in the aggregate analysis because the automatic difficulty adjustment reduces the Bitcoin reward per terahash in proportion of the increase in the global hash rate

*    measure the amount of additional RAM required for the specific amount of additional block size you're proposing  
*    survey the non-mining node operators to determine whether they would upgrade the RAM, replace the computer if necessary, or retire the node  
Then you can ask whether the community would accept a 40% reduction in the node count (if that's what the survey tells you)

You have a conceptual block  
Most computer data is "raw binary", strings of bits  
You can not print a bit on a screen, nor on a web page  
To see the contents of a string of bits, we convert it, sometimes to hexadecimal, which involves grouping the bits by 4, and looking up a table of hexadecimal values [0-9,a-f]  
The hexadecimal characters 2a39b1dcf62497a2a76c8f6e8fee316c are a human-readable conversion of a bitstring  
When Bitcoin (or any cryptography software) uses SHA256, it feeds the raw bitstring to the SHA256 function, not the "human readable" hexadecimal representation  
This one:  (and most similar pages) do not convert to a bitstring, they convert to human-readable '0' and '1' characters. This is not useful, because it's where we started - you created all the '0' and '1' characters when you did your coin tosses  
echo and xxd and openssl are simple programs for manipulating data. If you ever get to use a real operating system, you will find them already there, ready to use  
coin_toss.bin is a file name  
Meanwhile ...  
  
Enter 2a39b1dcf62497a2a76c8f6e8fee316c, and save the file  
Then ...

It is simpler than that  
You do not need to know the customer's Bitcoin address  
Abandon the misconception that you only have one address. Read this:  
  


  






Your wallet creates a new receiving address for every expected receipt  
*    issue a new receiving address for every sale  
*    send the address to the customer  
*    keep a list linking each address to its sale/invoice  
Then when your wallet tells you it has received Bitcoins, you can see which address received the money, and your list tells you which invoice is being paid  
To make it easier to track your receipts, install a watching-only Electrum wallet on a PC or mobile device. Watching-only wallets only contain addresses, not private keys. They are useful for monitoring incoming coins. Copy and paste all your addresses into the waching-only Electrum wallet, and have a look at it a few times every day

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

Not obviously  
Only if you're an honest person  
Yes you can send Bitcoin this way, but you can never send Bitcoin to me this way because I have no way to know you destroyed all copies of the private key  
  
The private key is printed on paper buried inside the coin  
The trust risk is that the workers at the coin factory might have access to the private keys before they're sealed into the coin  
Also, some Bitcoin ATMs work this way  
Most Bitcoin ATMs send to your existing address, and scan the address's QR code before the transaction  
Some Bitcoin ATMs have an option to print out a private key instead  
The trust risk is that the ATM operator knows the private key

The integrity of the chain is the same  
You can not spend unless there is a transaction output to spend  
A transaction can only be pruned if it has no unspent outputs - as above, "fully spent"  
If a transaction exists, and its output has been spent, the consensus rules prevent double spending by finding the spending transaction  
If a transaction has been pruned, the consensus validation knows its outputs cannot be spent, just because it no longer exists  
You're losing full history, which some people will find inconvenient, but there is no risk to the integrity of the Blockchain. There is also no reason to make pruning compulsory. People who want a full history Blockchain can keep one  


Miners only supply new blocks for validation. Pruning only applies to blocks which are already deep enough that they can not be orphaned or reorganised  


Is this a coinbase question?  
The answer is the same, the block is checked by the node network when the miner creates it (as happens now), and the coinbase transaction can only be pruned after its output is already spent

Correct. In 2004, I timed the POS delay for card transaction approval. It was 9 seconds. Back then, 70% of customers were still using cash, and they got very impatient waiting for other customers' card transactions to be approved. Today, card use is 70%, and the approval time is 2-3 seconds. 30 seconds would cause queue riots  
Bitcoin was not designed for instant, in-person, sales. As explained on the first page of the white paper, in a meatworld shop, cash is the payment method to use when your credit card company bans your purchase. Bitcoin was designed to be analogous to cash for network transactions  
As for the rest of your rant, you're confusing delay with throughput. Measuring TPS does not imply that transactions are approved every second. The TPS throughput calculation is the average number of transactions in a block divided by the average block interval  
Scaling is not dependent on block size or delay. Adjusting either or both of these only moves the point at which blocks fill up, it does not prevent blocks filling up

Arguably, all Bitcoin users have a genuine requirement to run a node, since every user who does not run a node has to trust some other person's node to handle their transactions  
A better question to discuss would be, how many nodes are required to be sure the node network is decentralised. This has been discussed many times, and has no precise answer. The most certain answer is that anything which could reduce the node count should be avoided

Selling off part of their capacity helps spread the risks to the contract clients  
When I looked at a Genesis contract, it had a clause allowing Genesis to cancel the contract at any time, if the equipment mining that contract becomes unprofitable  
The contract is a single up-front payment, and the calculators typically show a decent profit over a 2-year contract period, but the contracts often end after about 8 months

[How to Create a Bitcoin Receive Address from a Coin Flip](  
The brainwallet link on that post is now dead  
I use  to convert an arbitrary private key, such as from a coin toss / dice throw, into a Bitcoin private key in WIF format  


Import the WIF-format private key into Electrum, or some other wallet software which is friendly to JBoK (just a bunch of keys) wallets. Many wallet apps only support HD wallets  
  
Note this documentation is worded to make people think that sweeping is better than importing. For non-HD wallets, importing is the only way to get your key into an Electrum wallet. Do not mix a HD wallet with imported keys generated from a coin toss / dice throw. Keep the wallets separate, and properly backed up  
For HD wallets, see   
If you don't trust the built-in randomiser on that page, use the coin toss technique and read the documentation to learn how many coin tosses you need and how to convert the resulting bitstring into a BIP39 word list  
  
The number of coin tosses is the number of bits required, and the number of bits depends on the number of words you want  
For example, a 12-word seed requires 128 bits, and the process of converting the bitstring (heads for zero, tails for one) into words is:  
*    calculate a 4-bit checksum and add it to the 128 coin toss bits  
*    split the bits into twelve chunks of eleven bits  
*    each 11-bit chunk is a number from 0-2047. Use this number to pick a word from a list of 2048 words:   
  
It's simple, but tedious

Don't backup wallets, go for the lowest level of data which can be imported into any wallet when you need it - the secret keys  
From here, the principle is the same as any data backup, except that you risk losing real financial value if you get it wrong  
Save the encrypted secret keys to DVD  
Make a second, identical DVD  
Generate a 100% PAR2 recovery set for the encrypted keys  
Burn this to a third DVD  
Make a fourth DVD, identical to the third one  
Keep all 4 DVDs in physically separate places  
Never forget the passphrase to decrypt your secret keys  
A PAR2 recovery set can be used to repair partially corrupted data, even if the PAR2 data is also partially corrupt  
Having 2 copies of the data, plus 2 copies of 100% PAR2 recovery sets provides fallback options for recovering from data corruption on one or two of the DVDs  
Check the DVDs every 6 months or so, and make new ones if they show any data corruption  
If you want to spread the risk some more, separate the secret keys according to value, and put them on separate DVDs  
Arrange your Bitcoins so that every single key has less value than (say) 5 XBT  
Then backup the keys to DVD so that each DVD has less value than 20 XBT, or whatever combination of risk-spreading and convenience works for you  
More DVDs, greater risk spread  
Fewer DVDs, more convenient DVD handling and storage  
Hardware wallets? Why? A single point of failure, the flash ROM storage media inside. No thanks  
Paper? As good as DVD, provided it's checked every 6 months or so for ink fading, cockroach infestation (they love eating paper), acid rotting, moisture damage  
Paper is less convenient than DVD because if there are more than a handful of keys, the wad of paper will require a lot more physical storage space  
OTOH, you could consolidate your 100+ XBT into a single Bitcoin address, and just have a single key printed on one page  


Simple  
Run a wallet, Mycelium or Electrum, etc and just import one or more keys from your DVD backup whenever you need to spend  


Remember your password  
If this is hard, there are techniques described in security discussions all over the Internet  
The fewer memory aids you need to remember passwords, the safer they are, but if you forget, then your Bitcoin keys are so safe even you can't use them  
As for deterministic wallets, no thank you  
I prefer the simplicity of treating each key-pair separately, and explicitly backing up each secret key  
However, I understand the added convenience of being able to recover an entire wallet of keys from a single "seed phrase"  


This is where I like the idea of a single piece of paper with a single key  
Just don't lose it

Storage and bandwidth are not the main issues  
Bitcoin relies on nodes confirming blocks with minimum latency  
To keep latency low, Core is coded so that all the important data required to confirm a new block is held in RAM  
Increasing the blocksize has a disproportionate effect on the amount of RAM required to run a node  
Nodes with insufficient RAM will drop out  
Fewer nodes means less decentralization  


The increased RAM requirement is documented  
The node count reduction is unpredictable  


Definitely an exaggeration, but as above, unpredictable  
Some concrete examples ...  
There is a fairly recent thread documenting the calculation that a 2MB blocksize will increase the minimum RAM requirement from 2GB to 8GB  
Read the numerous threads in this subreddit "I'm running a node on a Raspberry Pi"  
The official guides to running a node specify 2GB minimum RAM  
Raspberry Pi has 1GB, and needs some fiddly tweaking to run a Core node  
Increase the blocksize, and all those cheap hardware nodes will disappear overnight  
There are no sub 100-dollar single board computers with even 4GB RAM, let alone 8GB  
If I rent a VPS from Hetzner (for example), a VPS with 2GB RAM is 7 Euro, a VPS with 8GB RAM is 20 Euro (monthly fees)  
The network will lose a lot of nodes just through inertia. The old node will stop working. The node operator will have to go to the trouble of upgrading to a more expensive hosting service, as well as deciding to pay the substantial cost increase  
Easier to cancel the service  
There are no money rewards for running a Core node

If this is true, Bitcoin does not need mass adoption  
Bitcoin only needs people with enough common sense to protect their keys against negligent loss and theft  
You, and many others, underestimate the masses. I believe people will eventually learn to care for their keys, and mass adoption will follow. I am not in a hurry  


Get a technical clue before posting this nonsense. Bitcoin bandwidth propagates one tiny block every 10 minutes. The only pressing problem with Bitcoin nodes is the node initialisation time. This can be fixed by pruning spent transactions from their blocks, making the Blockchain small enough to initialise in a few minutes  
The widespread belief that the Blockchain must contain a permanent record of every transaction since genesis prevents this innovation  


The simplest way to achieve this would be for banks to buy and sell Bitcoin through Internet banking. I want the Bitcoin sent direct to my personal wallet. I will never support bank custody of my Bitcoin  
Banks are not innovative. This service will happen, very slowly. It will start with Bitcoin businesses buying existing, small banks

Bitcoin is created from nothing, as part of the "mining" process  
A new block is added to the Blockchain on average every 10 minutes  
Miners compete to win the race to add each new block to the chain  
The winning miner gets a chunk of new Bitcoin as a windfall prize  
Still non-technical ...  
a Block is a collection of transactions  
the Blockchain is a complete collection of every Block (therefore every transaction) ever created since the beginning of Bitcoin

You misunderstand the difficulty / hashrate relationship ...  
Difficulty is adjusted to ensure that blocks are mined 10 minutes apart, on average  
Everybody knows the reward amount  
Commodity market economics operate to ensure that the cost of the total hashing capacity in the mining network is always marginally lower than the mining reward  
The difficulty level creates a natural equilibrium. Any change in input costs will increase / decrease hashing capacity proportionally, and the difficulty level will decrease / increase in response  
The equilibrium will settle at the lowest possible profit margin the participants will tolerate  
Mining has multiple input costs, and the ASIC market matured to the point where all costs are the same, except electricity  
Inevitably this then led to all miners being located in data centres with the cheapest electricity  
For whatever political / economic reasons China has a lot of subsidised electricity  
You misunderstand what a pool is ...  
One miner wins the race to mine each block  
To justify mining, nearly all miners have joined pools, where the blocks rewards won by any pool member are spread among all the members of the pool  
Pools are not owned  
A pool is a cooperative of thousands of individuals who have decided to indulge in mining  
Centralisation?  
If a pool is managed by one or a small group of managers making decisions on behalf of all the pool members, this could cause a reduction in the decentralisation required by the network design of Bitcoin  
Is this preventable?  
The simplest way to alleviate centralised pool operation is for all miners to join pools which delegate decision-making to the pool members, instead of pools which are controlled from the top  
Is it preventable some other way?  
Of course, use the lessons learned from Bitcoin to make (yet another) coin, with zero mining rewards and zero fees  
Then all miners will have altruistic motives, just as node operators do in the Bitcoin network  
There will be a lot less hashing power, but it will be much better distributed

Yes, it just works, but you can't run Bitcoin-qt and bitcoind at the same time  
  


This means if you shut down Bitcoin-qt and start bitcoind, it will see the same blockchain files and know it is already initialised  
That quote is slightly misleading "usually referred to as just Bitcoin” means Bitcoin-qt  
Also, if you're running Bitcoin-qt, you don't need to run bitcoind. All the bitcoin-cli commands work with Bitcoin-qt, if you add this to bitcoin.conf

What are you protecting yourself from?  
The biggest risk of loss is negligence, not theft  
Paper is a good backup medium, if you have a process which recognises that paper is fragile - acid corrosion, fungal attack, moisture damage, ink fading, insect consumption  
Assume that your paper will be damaged in some way  
The worst thing you can do is have a single copy, store it somewhere and ignore it for years  
To protect against these risks, have multiple copies stored in different places  
Frequently - every 3 months - check every copy. Replace any damaged copies  
Hard drives and optical disks are also good backup media. Assume they can be damaged - not by cockroaches or fungus - each medium has its own damage risks. Use the same processes - multiple copies in separate locations, frequent checking, replace bad copies  
Flash memory is unsuitable because it has an unpredictable failure mode  
This story:   
tells a tale of lost data due to a failed flash drive and a faded paper stored in an attic  
Frequent checking of the paper would have saved the revocation certificate, but there was only one copy, stored 450km away  
Flash drives can work perfectly for years, or they can become 100% unreadable in an instant, at any age  
Encryption, with a strong passphrase, is good for protecting against theft. The so-called "25th-word" or "13th-word" can be a 7-word diceware passphrase. Alternatively, use an AES encryption tool - GnuPG, openssl, 7zip - with a 7-word diceware passphrase  
Then the biggest risk is forgetting the passphrase

An address is not a wallet  


    bitcoin-cli help importaddress
Very detailed answer there  


Knowing the private key or the address makes no difference to the transaction history. Your Blockchain contains the full history of all Bitcoin transactions since the genesis block. Your wallet contains a list of all transactions for your addresses  
If you import an address, your wallet does not have a list of transactions for that address. This is why the importaddress command has a "rescan" option. Your node reads the whole Blockchain to get a list of the transactions for this new address. This might take hours  
You're right, your node does not know all the transactions for an arbitrary address, until it has spent a few hours looking for them  
rescan is not available for pruned Blockchains

If Bitcoin is permanently "stuck" at 3 transactions per second, it will settle at that transaction rate, as a kind of equilibrium  
If the demand is greater than 3 transactions per second, the excess transactions will (in a sense) be locked out of Bitcoin by long confirmation times and unreasonable fees  
People wishing to avoid the inconvenience of confirmation delays and high fees will choose other currencies  
Eventually there will be a diversity of currencies, each operating just below its capacity, complementing each other, each currency freely exchangeable with all the others

Some feedback ...  
This is hard to follow, mainly because you've linked to the older guide, so half the instructions are here and half are there  
I would not recommend the SD card for storing the blockchain and database  
Raspberry Pi has a reputation for freezing when there is high I/O on the SD bus  
The USB bus is separate to the SD bus  
For a pruned chain, it would be better to use a 16GB USB flash  drive  
Because you don't need the GUI, Jessie Lite is a much better raspbian install  
It's not necessary to build then prune the blockchain in 2 separate steps. bitcoind will build and prune at the same time. It still downloads the whole blockchain, but prunes the blocks as it builds the database. You can build a pruned node without storing the entire blockchain. You could even do this on the Pi, but it would be a few days slower  
A very minor point: Why use winscp? You're using putty for ssh, you could use putty pscp (and/or putty psftp) for file transfer

Price-fixing collusion is not necessary for this outcome  
If a miner wanted to maximise fee income, he would sort the unconfirmed transactions in fee order, highest fee first, then select transactions until the block is full  
If all miners follow this practice, then the fee levels are actually set by users, and their impatience to have their transactions added to the blockchain  
One way to counter this is to set up "non-greedy" mining pools, with miners who care more about the health of Bitcoin than about maximising fee income, selecting transactions by age, oldest first, ignoring fee  
The current situation is somewhere in between, and the fee levels are driven primarily by user impatience, which in turn is driven by capacity constraints

The key to understanding cloud mining is that you're not paying a monthly or yearly fee as you might pay for a server in a data centre  
**Cloud mining customers pay a once-only fee for a specific amount of hashing capacity**  
Even though the Cloud Miner "owns" the hardware, they fund the capital cost of the hardware from these once-only charges, and then sell the right to mine on the hardware which the customer funded for them  
Then ...  
* they charge a monthly service fee  
* force you to mine for their pool  
* only pay you part of your mining income  
The benefit to the Cloud Miner is that they can get a data centre economy of scale without having to raise capital for all the ASICs to fill it  
They're also passing the capital risk to the customer. An ASIC becomes obsolete as soon as a more powerful one arrives in the market  
New ASIC in the market -&gt; More hashing power in the network -&gt; increased mining difficulty -&gt; old ASIC can no longer mine profitably -&gt; old ASIC value is written down to zero  
It's not a Ponzi, because they don't promise that the customer will actually profit, so they have no need to fund customer profits from new customer sales  
A cloud mining customer can only profit if the payback period for the initial payment is shorter than the obsolescence period for the ASICs he paid to use  
Summary  
* the customer pays for the capital cost of the ASIC  
* the Cloud Miner owns the ASIC  
* the customer gets to use the ASIC's hashing power for an indeterminate period  
* the cloud miner does not guarantee that the customer will profit

If you are using a VPN, then port forwarding through your router will have no effect  
You have to port forward through your VPN  
Many VPN providers support port forwarding. See my notes about this:  
  
My node is port-forwarded through my AirVPN account. I had to add a line to bitcoin.conf

to match the available forwarding port on AirVPN. Port 8333 was not available  


It should be the same  




This could means you need to port forward the Pi's IP address, not the address you are forwarding to now  
or it could mean that you are not running bitcoind - a port is only open if there is a software service listening on this port - your post says it's running and connecting to peers  
or it could be that your ISP's carrier-grade NAT can not forward ports

The only definition of consensus is the Core code. There are arguments elsewhere about documenting the consensus rules, and some resistance to doing this.

That's part of the question you're supposed to research before going to an ATM to exchange Bitcoin for cash. The most common transaction process is to supply your cellphone number, and walk away for an hour or so, wait for a SMS. The SMS contains a one-time PIN. You return to the machine, enter the PIN and it dispenses your cash. The operator can make you wait as many confirmations as he wants. You can not return to the machine until you receive the SMS  
These men apparently did their research, found a Bitcoin ATM operator which did not bother waiting for confirmations. No waiting for them

The same metric applies. Is there enough hashing power available? SHA256 availability on NiceHash (for example) is minuscule  
Retiring miners don't just unplug a couple of Antminers from a wall outlet and store them on a shelf, ready to start up again at a moment's notice. Most miners have expenses for power infrastructure, cooling and floor space. If they retire a few hundred devices, they also retire the associated infrastructure. A conspiracy would require recommissioning the infrastructure, with the associated costs and delay, before turning on the miners  


**IF** the hashing power is low enough that spare capacity can be marshalled to perform a 51% attack, and if the spare capacity is available to a small enough conspiracy group to make it logistically viable  
If this is going to happen, it will happen to the low-hash-rate SHA256 coins first - BCash2018, then BCash2017  
What happens then?  
ETH Classic was only hit once. Why not again and again until it dies? It is still vulnerable  
Why is ETH Classic vulnerable, but not ETH?  
If I was retiring 100 Antminers from Bitcoin because the price falls below USD2000, it would be more viable to 51% attack BSV than Bitcoin

No  
Transactions can be pruned and pruned transactions can be replaced by Merkle branches. The Merkle root hash represents all the transactions in a block. A block with some transactions pruned will always have enough Merkle branch hashes representing the pruned transactions to calculate the correct Merkle root hash, and therefore the correct block header hash. A block with all transactions pruned only needs to be a header  


This history serves no purpose in consensus. New blocks contain transactions which are spending unspent outputs. Fully spent transaction history is dead weight. It is not sustainable to keep it all forever

The OP recognises this  
but is proposing that the difficulty could fall far enough that retired miners have access to more hash power than active miners. If the retired miners conspire to secretly switch their hashing power back on, mining a parallel chain branch for a few blocks, then announce those blocks to the network, they will have the longest chain, with the opportunity to double-spend

Someone posted a coin expiry suggestion here a couple of years ago  
I can't find it now - Reddit search is abominable, and Google only indexes about 10% of Reddit threads  
It was along these lines:  
If a coin (unspent transaction output) is more than 100 years old, its value can be recovered by spending it in a transaction with no outputs  
Use a new consensus rule to make this work:  
An unsigned transaction is valid if the inputs are spending coins more than 100 years old, and the transaction has no outputs  
Why no outputs?  
Because transaction fees are calculated as the difference between all the transaction input amounts and all the transaction output amounts  
If the coin expiry transaction is valid, the value is paid to the block miner as fees  
There are strong objections to coin expiry. The main objection is that there is no way to tell if a coin is lost, or if someone is hoarding it, even if it is 100 years old. Expiring hoarded coins is theft

Firstly, 51% is not enough to properly attack Bitcoin  


So, the transactions have to be valid  
Here is the part you are missing  
If I have (for example) 10 times the hash power of the current mining network, then I can mine a few blocks secretly in parallel with the current miners. All my blocks are valid, and they contain all valid transactions  
While this is happening, I am sending bitcoins to somebody in return for litecoins. They wait for my Bitcoin transaction to confirm and send me litecoins  
In my secret parallel chain, I am spending the same bitcoins, sending them to myself  
When I have received the litecoins, I announce my mined blocks to the node network. I have 10 times the hash power, so my chain is longer. All the nodes accept my blocks as valid, and they remove the "stale tip" from their blockchains. The deleted blocks (stale tip) contain my litecoin purchase transactions. The new blocks contain my send-to-self transactions. I get the litecoins and I get to keep my bitcoins - successful double-spend fraud

I don't think there is much to fear about being considered responsible for a questionable Bitcoin transaction on a node, because all nodes see all the same transactions. A lawyer might argue the opposite - every individual node, and the community of nodes in aggregate are equally responsible for every "evil" transaction on the Blockchain  
And just in case ...  
Whenever I rent a server in a data center, I use providers who do not require proof of ID, and give pseudonyms if a name is required. Many of the signup forms I see only ask for username and email address. I use a new email address for every contact - no crossover. Pay with cryptocurrency

This is not true. Wallets do not spend from addresses. They spend coins  
Different wallets have different criteria for selecting which coins to spend, but none of them will automatically spend all the coins from a re-used address. If the wallet allows users to control which coins to spend (Electrum, for example) then **the user can choose** to spend all the unspent coins on a re-used address. But nobody can rely on any wallet to do this automatically

Don't add "Bitcoin" to the question. Bitcoin does not make gambling legal or illegal

There have been some comments in the Bitcoin community that MimbleWimble would be a problem because there is no way to externally verify the integrity of the Blockchain with respect to the total amount of coins. Output amounts are not published on a MimbleWimble Blockchain, therefore there is no way to add them all up  
Bitcoin fans love adding up all the UTXOs and verifying that the grand total matches the amount mined since the genesis block  
The absence of addresses isn't a big deal. It means that building and signing a transaction is a two-step process requiring cooperation and communication between the sender and receiver before broadcast  
I haven't seen anybody mention the need to backup wallets. The Bitcoin community has adopted a practice of "you only need to save your seed words". You can recover a wallet using your seed words, but your wallet still needs to scan the Blockchain to rebuild your transaction history. This would not be possible in MimbleWimble

Her private key  


Bob's address  


No, Alice sends nothing directly to Bob  
You missed the most important part. Alice's wallet contains coins to spend. These coins are transaction outputs from older transactions, where some other person has sent Bitcoin to Alice  
Alice's coins are transaction outputs. A transaction output contains an address and an amount  
To send Bitcoin to Bob, Alice has to spend some of her coins  
A transaction contains inputs and outputs. Every input contains the transaction ID hash and output number of the output it is spending. It also contains the signature and public key  
How to prove Alice's transaction is valid?  
For each input, go to the Blockchain and find the corresponding output - this is the coin being spent. Does it exist? If it exists on the Blockchain, does it exist in the UTXO database? If it's missing from the UTXO database, this means Alice spent the coin already. You can only spend a coin once  
Do the output amounts corresponding to the inputs add up to more than the output amounts in Alice's transaction - makes sure Alice is not sending Bob 10 Bitcoin when she only owns 0.00010000 Bitcoin  
For each input, verify Alice's signature. The public key in the input 
is used to verify that the signature was made with the corresponding private key. Then hash the public key to an address, and make sure the address matches the address in the output being spent  
This verification is performed by every node for every transaction in each new block, after a new block is mined. A block containing any invalid transaction will be rejected by all nodes

Yes, Bitcoin is defined as digital currency  
Also, the last time this proposed legislation was discussed here, the legislation was to include a schedule of exemptions, and digital currency is supposed to be in the exempt list - because the cash ban is a tax measure, and there is no current concern about digital currency being used like cash to avoid tax obligations  
Unfortunately, being included in the legislation, then exempt in an attached schedule, means that the exemption can be removed by the Treasurer at any time in the future, with no debate in Parliament  
The ban applies to business transactions. You will not be able to buy Bitcoin for $10,000 cash from a person who sells Bitcoin as a business. You will be able to buy Bitcoin from your friends, for cash in person, the $10,000 ban does not apply to a non-commercial transaction  
There are some significant objections in Parliament to this cash ban, which is why it was referred to a Senate Committee. Unfortunately, the ban is supported by both Liberal and Labor parties, so the objections by small parties and independents will be ineffective

Some discussion points ...  
If the price falls that far, the rewards of a 51% attack are proportionally lower  
The to-date history of 51% attacks using altcoins indicates that the only victims are exchanges. Arguably, these are attacks on the exchanges, not on the coins. Also, exchanges with proper confirmation rules and double-spend detection can avoid being attacked. If exchanges are careful, the losses should be limited to the double-spending transactions in one block - not enough to reward an attacker  
The 51% attack scenario discussed in this paper and the earlier one assume the ready availability of idle hash power for an attacker - the possibility that a marketplace like NiceHash has idle SHA256 hashes ready to rent in bulk with no delay. This scenario is unrealistic, for logistical reasons

Definitely low frequency. This is a tiny marketplace, very low trading volumes. Sure, there is a lot of automated trading. But bots don't cause price changes, they react to them. At this point in the life of Bitcoin, automated trading does not even have enough momentum to amplify swings  


Not relevant to Bitcoin. Nobody is making profit in Bitcoin trading by installing slightly shorter optical fiber paths, and exploiting tiny telecommunications latency differences. The exchanges themselves are too slow and fragile for this type of opportunity

Different judges will see this differently  
Some of the legal opinions, and some of the appeal court judgments, allow the 5th amendment to avoid giving up your passwords, but then don't allow the 5th amendment to prevent the court forcing you to enter the password yourself  
Personally, I think this distinction is so artificial that it's ridiculous. A proper interpretation of rights (my opinion only) should recognize that exposing your encrypted data can be self-incriminating. The wrinkle is that law enforcement reading your computer files is not your testimony in response to interrogation, so the judges want to allow that method of self-incrimination

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

Most P2P transactions transfer the fiat bank-to-bank, making it impossible for sellers to go underground, because all bank accounts are locked down by KYC now. Cash in person is a risk if law enforcement is your buyer. Cash by mail is a risk because the buyer knows your snailmail address  
This is not all bad. It drives adoption towards private non-profit in-person transactions  
Yes, the risk is lower if sellers leave the public platforms, but the customers are harder to find in underground channels, and there is a big trust issue caused by the prevalence of scammers on Telegram

No current project, but there is a design in the original Satoshi White Paper  
It is close to what you specify. It does not delete outputs. It deletes transactions which are fully spent. A transaction is fully spent if all its outputs are spent  




transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree
This pruning mechanism is the main reason for using a Merkle Tree and using the Merkle root hash to represent all of a block's transactions in the block header  
If a transaction is fully spent, and if it is old enough, delete the transaction from the block and replace it with its hash  
If two Merkle neighbours have been deleted, their hashes can be hashed (Merkle style), and two hashes can be replaced with one hash  
A Merkle tree is a pyramid. Eventually, all the transactions in a block are fully spent, appropriately aged and deleted. All their Merkle hashes are paired. Pairs of Merkle hashes in each level of the tree are hashed and deleted. The Merkle root hash in the block header is the hash of the two Merkle branch hashes below it. When there are no transactions left, the block is just a header - and it is still valid  
You **can not delete outputs** without invalidating the hash calculations which prove the block header hash. Because of the Merkle tree, you **can delete transactions** if you replace each deleted transaction with its hash  
You can not delete partially spent transactions, for obvious reasons  
Transactions can not be deleted if they are too recent, because occasionally the chain tip needs to be reorganised. 100 blocks would be enough. Three months would give a huge margin  


You can run a node on a phone with the existing pruning method  
The advantage of Satoshi's pruning design would be to make node initialisation much faster - just a few minutes
@_date: 2019-11-15 03:18:03
If you run a Bitcoin node, it does not have an index of transactions by address, except for your own wallet. The wallet file contains a history of transactions for all your addresses. You can use a watching-only wallet on a Bitcoin node. You can import any arbitrary address into a wallet (not sure why you would monitor any addresses except your own, unless you're a spy). If you import a new address into a Core wallet, it will spend a few hours scanning the Blockchain to build transaction history. Are you OK with waiting, or do you want an instant answer for the transactions for any arbitrary address?  
You don't need a block explorer. You can get transactions by address instantly if you install an Electrum server and use the Electrum wallet to look up the addresses of interest  
For privacy the Electrum Server must initialise its indexes using your own node's Blockchain, and you must tell your Electrum wallet to only use your own Electrum server  
Make sure you have a lot of spare disk space  
Also, a Bitcoin address does not have a balance

I only have one, but understanding this one requires knowledge of many prerequisites  
How does Bitcoin prevent a coin being spent twice?  
Hint: one important prerequisite is that when a coin is spent once, that coin is not updated on the Blockchain, not marked "spent", because transactions on the Blockchain are **never updated**, see "immutability"  
Hint 2: The obviously incorrect answer is that the Blockchain is scanned from start to end to discover any previous spend. It takes 40 seconds to validate all the transactions in a new block. It would take hours to scan the whole Blockchain

Bitcoin is a network of nodes, computers running software  
The most important job of every Bitcoin node is to check the contents of every new block  
The rules about mining rewards are some of the things which are checked:  
*    the first transaction in a block is the mining reward  
*    the mining reward transaction has no financial inputs  
*    the mining reward output amount is the sum of the block reward and the transaction fees  
*    the transaction fees are (the sum of the input amounts of all the other transactions) minus (the sum of the output amounts of all the other transactions)  
*    the block reward amount must be correct for the current halving epoch. The amount was 50 Bitcoin at the beginning. Every 210000 blocks, the amount is cut in half. This has happened twice  
All Bitcoin nodes have software which checks exactly the same rules. If any of the rules are broken, the block is rejected and not passed to any more nodes. An invalid block disappears forever, as if it had never existed  
The mining reward is sent to the Bitcoin address in the output of transaction zero. The miner can not spend the reward until 100 more blocks have been mined  


Miners do not validate transactions. They indulge in a trivial hashing race

You misunderstand the nature of hashing  
It doesn't matter how many bits of the block header are changing, the chance of discovering a valid hash is the same. The pseudo-random nature of hashing means there is no "moving target" issue with changes to the hash input  
Clarification of your understanding of variations in the Merkle root hash during mining ...  
The nonce only has a range of about 4 billion values. A single miner hashes 50 trillion times per second. To avoid recalculating the same 4 billion hashes 12 thousand times per second, the Merkle root hash has to change. Most of the time, modifying part of the mining  block reward transaction (a part called extranonce) with a random value is an efficient way to change the Merkle root hash. Miners can, and do, add new transactions to their blocks, but not very often  
Refer to the comment for a clearly written explanation of the role of probability in Bitcoin mining  
The actual impact of the unpredictability of Bitcoin mining is not that "there is no guarantee", but that the block interval often varies from a few seconds to more than an hour
@_date: 2019-03-16 04:29:43


Bitcoin can not simply reverse the inflation coins because that would make the block hashes invalid, can not recalculate the block hashes without re-doing the proof of work mining for those blocks  
Repeat the 2010 fork, rewind back to the last safe block. This invalidates all the transactions in the deleted blocks - the valid transactions as well as the inflation fraud  
What happens next?  
Bitcoin loses trust, not only because there was an inflation bug, but more importantly because a lot of legitimate transactions were lost, moving value backwards from the recipients to the senders  
And then?  
After this, everything depends on unpredictable psychology. Is trust damaged so badly that everybody abandons Bitcoin? Or do many people stay loyal and keep using it because it is still an uncensorable payment system  


The price is not important  
**P.S.**  
After winding back to an earlier block, all the "lost transactions" still exist in the recipients' wallets and on node operators' disks all over the Bitcoin network. Because these transactions are already signed, anybody can re-inject them into the mempool for inclusion in the new blocks on the fork chain. Assuming most people are honest, and many people will be unaware of the fork for some time, most legitimate transactions could be rescued by doing this

After the final halving, miners will be paid 1 Satoshi to mine a block, plus all the transaction fees in the block's transactions  
Four years later, probably in 2140, miners will be paid 0 Satoshis to mine a block, plus all the transaction fees in the block's transactions

If the transaction has a change output, you can make a new transaction spending the change output, send it to yourself, to a new address in your own wallet. If the fee is high enough, the high fee of the new transaction will cause both transactions to confirm at the same time  
This is called "child pays for parent" CPFP  


It will. Wait 24 hours more  


Most Bitcoin nodes have a copy of your unconfirmed transaction in a mempool. Each node has it's own mempool. Most nodes have a policy of removing a transaction from the mempool after 14 days. A lot of nodes will remove transactions after approximately 3 days if the amount of transactions in the mempool is bigger than the memory space allocated for the mempool. Transactions are more likely to be removed from a node's mempool if they are old and have a low fee  
You cannot cancel a transaction. You can prevent it from being confirmed by spending one of the transaction inputs in a new transaction - a transaction sending your Bitcoin to yourself  
If you try to do this while your transaction is still in a node's mempool, the node will reject the new transaction with an error "already in mempool". If you wait 3 or 4 days, and your transaction starts disappearing from many nodes' mempools, then you can submit your replacement "send to self" transaction. Or you can rebroadcast the original transaction and wait another 3 days for confirmation  
Your options:  
*    wait another day for mempool congestion to fade away  
*    send a CPFP transaction  
*    if still unconfirmed when many nodes have deleted your transaction, rebroadcast the transaction and wait some more  
*    if still unconfirmed when many nodes have deleted your transaction, send a replacement "pay to self" transaction

Yes, but in general there is no requirement to identify every customer. The regulations require risk management. Some operators believe it's easier (lazier) to avoid the complexity of risk-rating every transaction and apply the same processes to everybody


In my opinion, no legal ramifications unless your purpose for buying Bitcoin is to launder money or finance terrorism, but a lawyer might contradict my opinion

This will be debated when IPv6 finally displaces IPv4  
Generally, the answer will be "your firewall, your responsibility"  
NAT was introduced to conserve the IPv4 address space  
Before NAT, computers were directly connected to the Internet  
Devices without NAT - phones, tablets and laptops with 3G/4G modems - are directly connected to the Internet, except in countries where 4G services are delivered over carrier-grade NAT  
NAT is a convenient default firewall  
But when IPv6 arrives, NAT will not be necessary because conserving address space is not necessary  
Why use a complicated address/port mapping protocol as a firewall?  
It makes more sense to use a simple IP filter

*    SHA2-256 hash the public key  
*    RIPEMD-160 hash the SHA2 hash  
*    Prepend x'00'  
*    Calculate checksum  
*    Append checksum  
*    Convert to base58
The Bitcoin base58 character set:  
`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H J K L M N P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z`  
We can see that lower case characters represent the numbers 33-57. That's a clue  
The biggest possible address with 34 characters would have a RIPE hash plus checksum of 192 '1' bits  
Using  convert this hexadecimal:  
`00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`  
to an address:  
`1QLbz7JHiBTspS962RLKV8GndWFwiEaqKL`  
This proves that 34-character addresses can not have a second character higher than 'Q'  
Use the other calculator to convert the highest value 33-character address:  
`1zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz`  
to hexadecimal:  
`000AF820335D9B3D9CF58B911D87035677FB7F5280FFFFFFFF`  
Convert the lowest value 33-character address with a lowercase second character:  
`1aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`  
to hexadecimal:  
`000659C1CCE559E04D65BC9761EFD982E725D07322435E50D7`  
This proves that 33-character addresses with lowercase second character must have a RIPE hash between  
`0659C1CCE559E04D65BC9761EFD982E725D07322` and `0AF820335D9B3D9CF58B911D87035677FB7F5280`  
That's a fairly narrow range  
Any public key where the RIPE hash of the SHA2 hash is outside the range has to be hashed and then discarded. The narrow range means more discards, therefore more wasted work and higher charges  
Addresses can be 25-34 characters. There are valid RIPE hash ranges for having a lowercase second address character for 25-32 length addresses, but the ranges are narrower than the range for a 33-character address

Yes, a fundamental part of Satoshi's mechanism for preventing double-spends - no partial spends, spend once only - is counter-intuitive because it does not align with the way we spend cash currency. The $20 bill passed across the deli counter does not vanish and be magically replaced by two brand new $10 bills  


The miner's reward is paid using a Bitcoin transaction, similar to all the regular transactions in the block. There are three differences between the miner's reward transaction and regular transactions  
*    it is always the first transaction in every block  
*    it has no financial inputs, so it is an exception to the transaction validity rule that outputs must be not greater than inputs  
*    the miner must wait 100 blocks before he can spend the reward

The signature mechanism is asymmetric  
Sender signs transaction input using private key. Signature contains public key  
The coin being spent contains the sender's address. An address is a hash of a public key  
Transaction verification  
*    hashes the public key embedded in the transaction input signature, and checks whether the hash matches the address on the coin being spent  
*    verifies that the signature matches the public key  
This enables the signature to be proven without exposing the private key

At this point it all makes sense. A 51% attack is not viable because the "spare" retired hashing power is not actually available  
What if the price dropped to $1?  
The economics would push the hash rate down by more than 99%, not just a third. All the 1600-watt ASIC miners would be retired, written off. The remaining miners would be buying those $10 USB erupter ASICs and mining for pennies, or mining for a loss of a few pennies. Somebody with 100 S15 Antminers (and sufficient power ready to go) would easily be able to 51% attack and double-spend  
This is where it gets to hard to speculate  
If Bitcoin is only worth $1, would there be sufficient liquidity to create transactions with high enough value to make any profit from double-spending?  
This scenario is similar to the Bitcoin Gold double-spend incident. The attack was possible because a wealthy operator had early access to new ASIC miners when the Bitcoin Gold mining hash power was 100% GPU. One person running new ASICs was easily able to overpower the existing GPU miners. There was enough liquidity to defraud exchanges for several hours, by double-spending  
To your comment about exchanges  
Not all transactions occur on exchanges  
Also, there are enough no-KYC exchanges to run a 51% attack double-spend by selling Bitcoin for Litecoin, then spending the same Bitcoin to the attacker's wallet in the parallel chain. The attacker then owns the purchased Litecoin and the self-spent Bitcoin. The exchange loses. If it's a P2P exchange, the Litecoin sellers lose

The argument fails because it assumes a boss miner owning a huge amount of retired hash power, ready to be recommissioned for an attack. The reality is that an attack would require a conspiracy between a huge number of retired miners who do not know each other, have no common communications channel, and have hashing power ready to recommission in a coordinated way to mine a parallel chain branch which can overtake the normal chain. Not realistic

Not important. Also, there are at least 3 answers, and one of them involves pooled mining, an interesting topic which would complicate the discussion even more  


You're missing the distinction between coins created by every transaction, and coins created by mining  
Most transactions contain inputs and outputs. The output values must not be greater than the input values. Normally the output values are slightly less than the input values, and the small difference represents a transaction fee  
In every block, the first transaction is different. It is called a "coinbase" transaction (no relation to the Coinbase corporation). The coinbase transaction has no inputs and one output. The output value is the sum of the newly-minted Bitcoin, and the transaction fees  
When we talk about UTXO or "unspent coin", we do **not only** mean the coinbase transaction output  
Every input in every transaction correlates with (points back to) exactly one coin (output) from an older transaction. The input is spending the older coin. The outputs are new coins. Value is recirculated forever, because every transaction spends old coins and creates new coins

Filling in a detail  
The master key is not the word list  
The BIP32 seed is generated using a key stretching mechanism (derive key from password) borrowed from symmetric cryptography. The word list is used as the password and the passphrase (13th word/25th word if available) is appended to the string `mnemonic` as a salt. This password+salt are hashed 2048 times with SHA2-512 to create a 512-bit BIP32 seed  
This hashing process completely separates the value of the BIP32 seed from the BIP39 (or hand-made) word list. So, the question you're asking (and the answer you found) are all relevant to the BIP32 mechanism for deriving a set of 256-bit private keys from the BIP32 seed

This is the part of the fee question nobody discusses. There is a fee market when Bitcoin mempools and blocks become congested, but the fee market does not fix the congestion problem. The narrative that "fees determine priority for a scarce resource" is nonsense because it ignores the fact that Bitcoin is almost useless when block space becomes scarce

Speculators invent delusional "logic" to predict price increases  
Two fake logic delusions relating to the halving  
*    miners are creating half the number of Bitcoins, therefore the supply falls, therefore price rises. This is delusional because newly mined coins are a very tiny component of trading liquidity  
*    mining rewards (denominated in Bitcoin) will be reduced by half, but mining costs (denominated in fiat) do not change. Miners need the Bitcoin fiat exchange price to double so they can remain profitable, therefore the price will double. This is delusional because the Bitcoin fiat exchange price is determined by the price sentiment of buyers and sellers, is completely independent of the miners' need for profitability

The Bitcoin ledger (Blockchain) is a record of every transaction - hundreds of millions of transactions, 10 years of history. A transaction contains inputs and outputs. An output contains an address and an amount. An input spends an older output. An output can only be spent once. An input contains the transaction ID and output number of the output being spent and a cryptographic signature. The signature is public proof that the transaction containing the input was signed by the owner of the output's address. A Bitcoin transaction moves value by spending one or more coins (outputs) and creating one or more new coins  
The Blockchain does not identify who owns any address

It would not be safe to fully automate Bitcoin payments because that would require keeping your private keys online - a theft risk  
Also, your refund code process is an attack vector. If a thief was able to replicate the process, you might lose all your Bitcoin paying fake refund requests  
The Electrum Cold protocol is described here:  
  
That document describes the protocol using the Electrum GUI. The protocol can be mostly automated using Electrum's scripting commands. The manual parts are  


and  


You might be able to automate either of these steps by displaying the transaction as a QR code on one computer's screen, and permanently pointing the other computer's camera at the one computer's screen, waiting for QR codes to appear  
If you automate both of these steps, you're exposed to paying fake refund requests. Having at least one manual step is an opportunity to check the validity of each refund  
A slightly different option is to automate both screen-&gt;camera transaction transfers and manually sign the transactions. Check each transaction before signing it  
Off the top of my head, assuming Linux - you need qrencode and ImageMagick to display a QR code, and a camera app and zbar-tools to decode QR codes  
Construct the unsigned transaction using the paytomany Electrum command. Other relevant commands: deserialize, signtransaction, broadcast

Almost useless. Superficially, mining is a senseless guessing race, wasting computer processing cycles  
Not useless ...  
The main purpose of mining is to create a 10-minute delay between blocks. The delay is essential to ensure the node network has sufficient time to verify and propagate every block before the next one arrives  
The equal main purpose of mining is to prevent malicious actors from rewriting the history of the Blockchain. If a mal modifies a block, the block's hash changes, then the mal has to replicate 10 minutes of 400,000 miners hashing to find a new valid block hash. If the block is not the most recent, then its new hash needs to replace the prev_block_hash in the next block. Then the block hash of the next block has to be re-mined. Repeat for every subsequent block after the modified one  
The mining network continues to add new blocks to the Blockchain every 10 minutes. A malicious actor would be unable to recalculate multiple historical block hashes and also catch up with the blocks that were mined while the history re-work was happening  
Mining protects the Blockchain from modification (rewriting history) because mining "work" is too "hard" (not complex) for malicious rewriters to replicate  
In Satoshi's words: "The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended"  


This question is important. Contrary to 90% of blog articles and tutorials about Bitcoin mining, **miners do not verify transactions during mining**  
The only process miners perform is:  
*    make a tiny change to the block  
*    calculate the hash of the block header  
*    if the hash is higher than the target, repeat  
trillions and trillions of times, until one miner discovers a hash which is lower than the target  
Why does the myth of "miners verify transactions" persist?  
Firstly, the original document describing the design of Bitcoin, Satoshi's White Paper, describes a network of nodes which are also miners. At the beginning of Bitcoin, every node was a miner, therefore every miner verified transactions and blocks after each new block was mined  
Over time, the functions of mining and verification became separated by the development of specialist mining hardware. Unfortunately, the community of "Bitcoin journalists" are incorrectly repeating "miners verify" because they are too lazy to learn the distinction between mining (the guessing race), and verification (consensus). They just keep copying the same words they read in another article, all of which trace back to the 2009 interpretation of the Satoshi White Paper  
As mentioned in another comment, miners verify transactions before adding them to a block, but pre-mining verification is not mandatory. A miner verifies because he does not want his block to be rejected. Nodes verify blocks and transactions **after mining** to ensure the integrity of the Blockchain  


No. A new node does this once. It can take hours or days, depending on the CPU power of the node. The hash-linked structure of the Blockchain means that prior history is assumed to be unmodified when verifying new blocks - because the entire chain was verified when the node was initialized  


Clock time does not determine the order of blocks. Block order is defined by the existence block-to-block hash links  


This list of verifications is correct, but not complete  
This part of your understanding is accurate  
The important transaction verifications:  
*    every input spends a coin (output from an older transaction), the node must verify that the coin exists on the Blockchain, and must verify that the coin has never been spent  
*    every input signature must be verified against the public key, and the public key must be hashed to match the address of the coin being spent  
*    the output amounts must not be greater than the input amounts  
Block verifications:  
*   the coinbase transaction must have the correct amount, including the transaction fees  
*    the prev_block_hash must match the calculated hash of the previous block's header  
*    the Merkle root hash must be correct - the details of this require a lot of words  
*    the calculated block hash must be less than the target hash

Text-to-speech is the other way around. Converting audio to text is speech recognition. I would avoid this for financially sensitive information, because all the speech recognition tech used today relies on the baggage of giant collections of speech and context stored by huge tech firms: Amazon, Google, Apple. Your voice note has to go to them to be converted to text, and then gets stored by them permanently  
There is a lightweight speech recognition tech, but it is underdeveloped, possibly abandoned. It is 100% accurate. The catch is that the user has to learn a new language - the language specially designed to be 100% accurately recognized by a tiny computer program matching simple lists of recorded phonemes. The researchers discovered what pattern of phonemes could be reliably understood by computer software with a zero error rate, and then invented a language  
Most people are happy to give their voice samples to Google, Apple and Amazon to store permanently

A transaction has inputs and outputs  
The inputs are one or more coins selected from the coins you have in your wallet  
For the type of transaction your question is asking about, there will be two outputs - one for the amount you are paying the merchant, and a change output sent to a fresh address in your own wallet  
  
Good wallets will display a list of your available coins, and will let you choose which coins to spend and also let you specify the fee amount, or you can choose to let the wallet do the coin choosing and fee calculation automatically  
To your question: if you are doing your own coin control, you have to choose coins with enough value to cover the purchase plus the fees. The wallet will refuse the send the transaction if you get this wrong - no harm done, except a few minutes of lost time  
If you let the wallet work it out automatically, then the transaction just happens, as long as you have enough funds for the purchase and the fees. You specify the purchase amount, then the wallet calculates the fee, the wallet chooses the coins to be used for inputs and the wallet calculates the change amount  
Whether you choose coin control or automatic, the wallet calculates the change amount like so  
    change amount = sum of input amounts - merchant output amount - fee

The idea was published by Andrew Poelstra after receiving anonymous messages from Lord Voldemort. Poelstra is a mathematician and cryptographer at Blockstream. I'm not sure MimbleWimble was ever intended for Bitcoin. Some of Poelstra's speeches have suggested implementing it as a new coin - which later happened - or possibly as a 2nd layer or sidechain to Bitcoin. I think Poelstra is saying these days that "Altcoins are testnets for developers"  
Other experts before MimbleWimble have proposed confidential transactions - masking addresses and amounts in TXOs  
Anyway, don't believe me. Everything you need to know is here:

It's feature-rich  
One of the new features is the option to negotiate the block template between miner and server, where the miner has the option to choose all the transactions  
The other features include performance improvements driven by years of operating experience - ways to reduce the size of messages, the number of messages, remove redundancy. There are changes to make the network structure more flexible, and to standardize components which currently vary from pool to pool  


Yes, if you want the performance improvements, added flexibility, better standardization  
Not necessarily, because it still allows pool managers to select the transactions  
That is, miners can select the transactions for their own blocks, but they don't have to

Easier than what?  
Bitcoin is harder than cash if you're meeting your seller in person  
Bitcoin is easier than PayPal, credit cards, Internet banking or SWIFT, for any long-distance payment, legal or not  
"Easier" is the wrong question  
The point is stated in the "follow the money" quote in the linked article. At some point in the 20th century, law enforcement began to rely on tracing money flows as a technique for investigating organized crime. Organized crime learned to move money through unmonitored channels. Governments invented "money laundering" as a crime  
At his point it becomes obvious that using indirect investigation techniques (follow the money) is not as clever as it seemed. Law enforcement recognized this, and returned to older, more reliable investigation techniques. Money laundering laws were abolished. Just kidding  
If only common sense was a requirement for becoming a politician or a law enforcement officer. Unfortunately, instead of understanding the futility of monitoring money flows, law enforcement agencies demanded more and more pervasive monitoring of financial transactions, and politicians, being cowards, complied with these demands  
You don't have to worry about your privacy, we'll add a privacy clause into the monitoring law. If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear. We are protecting you against criminals and terrorists. Liars  
Now we have mass surveillance of financial transactions, and law enforcers claiming this surveillance is essential for them to investigate terrorism and organized crime. They're spying on the private affairs of every person to investigate a small number of criminals and terrorists. This is disproportionate. It is a fundamental breach of the privacy of ordinary people  
I can't repeal these unconscionable laws, because somehow the choice of politicians is limited to cowards who always agree to more surveillance  
If Bitcoin can reduce the surveillance of ordinary people, then people who believe in liberty can choose to use Bitcoin instead of heavily monitored financial services  
Law enforcement will have to accept that "follow the money" was always a bad idea, use legitimate techniques to investigate crime  
I don't have anything to hide. I have nothing I want you to know

The purpose of the Blockchain is separate from the purpose of proof of consent. The Blockchain can record that something happened at a particular time, and that a particular private key was used to seal the event into a transaction  
Proof of consent is a separate problem, tied to technical questions about proof of identity and digital signatures  
Bitcoin makes no pretense to prove identity. Bitcoin's use of digital signatures only identify a Bitcoin sender as the person who controls the private key linked to the receiving address of a previously received coin. The trust only extends that far, back to the coin being spent  
This is a variation of [trust on first use]( with the quirk that Bitcoin is "trust once only". Bitcoin wallets automatically create new keys and addresses as required  
Proof of consent requires a more conventional approach to cryptographic identity proof ...  
*    the patient uses conventional ID proof, and a key-pair linked to their identity  
*    a reliable person (notary, lawyer, JP, etc) signs the key as an affirmation that the key belongs to the person whose identity proof was sighted  
*    the identity proof, public key and notary signature can then be added to the Blockchain, before or simultaneously with the digitally signed consent affirmation

Yes it is incorrect  
There was no consensus for a block size increase

Not policy, so much as coding convenience. If a double-spend arrives, it seems more logical to reject the second-seen. I don't think Bitcoin would break if a node deleted the first-seen from mempool and accepted the second-seen, and this happens with RBF anyway  
Discussed here:  
  
The double-spend solution is an innovation in Bitcoin because it chooses one transaction to be valid, does not attempt to distinguish the honest transaction from the fraudulent transaction. Unlike previous cryptocurrencies, it does not attempt to unblind the identity of the fraudulent sender

A friend of a friend runs a non-profit, funded by donations. They've lost a few PayPal accounts over the years, and three credit card facilities  
Bitcoin is a solution, but there is huge resistance from the members. They have about a 50% success rate explaining that Bitcoin is an easier payment method than PayPal. The hardest objection is an irrational one. Because most of the MSM coverage of Bitcoin talks about price speculation and investment, people believe that using Bitcoin means jumping into the speculation cesspool - "I don't have any Bitcoin because ... ". The rational response is to explain that you can buy $20 of Bitcoin, then donate it immediately - no investment, no exposure to price volatility. Most people are not rational enough to understand this  
Most Bitcoin donors do not have their own wallet. They buy on Coinbase, then donate from the Coinbase account. A couple of years ago, a few of them would insert cash into a Bitcoin ATM to send the Bitcoin direct to the non-profit. Back then, it was common for Bitcoin ATMs to charge 5%. Now it is almost impossible to find one which charges less than 20%. Bitcoin ATM operators can charge whatever they like, but nobody uses them at that price  
They lose 15% on PayPal donations even though person-to-person PayPal payments are supposed to be zero-fee

Missing several things  


Mining is not consensus. Mining is simply dumb work, looping furiously through a hashing race, to delay the rate of creation of new blocks, and make it very hard to modify old blocks  
Consensus is validating a new block and all the transactions in the block, **after** the winning miner transmits a new block to the node network. Bitcoin nodes perform consensus. The code is probably in this module:   
As your question says, there is transaction checking at mempool time as well. The most important thing to know is that the validation which happens after a new block is mined is what secures the Blockchain. In a bug-free world, the transaction checking logic is the same at both ends. But if there was a bug at the mempool end, the Blockchain can not be corrupted by this bug. The worst that would happen is that a miner might create a block which then gets rejected by the node network - and this might temporarily delay the confirmation of new blocks  
Mining pools run nodes. If they run the Bitcoin Core node software, then the transaction checking is what you mentioned in your post. If they run other software, it should still do essentially the same set of checks. Miners do not want to create a block with invalid transactions in it. But they don't have to run Core node software to achieve this  
Miner runs a node. Miner's node has a mempool. Miner's node is well-connected to other nodes. Miner selects transactions from mempool to create a block. Miner furiously hashes for about 10 minutes, hoping to win the race. Winning miner sends winning block to its node using the "submitblock" RPC command

Only the sender can sign a transaction  
But any person who has a copy of a signed transaction can send it to the Bitcoin network  
Signed, unconfirmed transactions **never** actually expire  
An example to clarify ...  
Today, I can send a transaction with a fee of 1 Sat / byte  
Some time next month, Bitcoin transaction fees will be 100 Sats / byte, for about 3 months  
Being cheap, I send a transaction (to buy a Tshirt) with a 1 Sat / byte fee. It does not confirm. After the appropriate amount of time, my unconfirmed transaction disappears from the mempools of every node  
The recipient keeps a copy of the transaction, because he is unhappy that I set the fee too low. He has not sent my Tshirt, because he knows to wait for confirmation  
After 3 months, transaction fees drop back to 1 Sat / byte. I have not re-spent the coins in my unconfirmed Tshirt transaction because I forgot about that purchase. The Tshirt seller copies and pastes my old transaction into his wallet and sends it to the Bitcoin network  
Tshirt merchant sends my old, unconfirmed transaction to the Bitcoin network, receives the Bitcoin, and sends the Tshirt  
Back to our disaster hypothetical ...  
All the legitimate transactions in the deleted blocks have the same status as my unconfirmed Tshirt transaction. They do not exist in any mempool, but they do exist, including signatures, in the wallets of the sender and recipient, and on any node which saved a copy of the deleted blocks. If the sender is aware of the fork, and is dishonest, he will send his coins back to himself. Most people will not - because they are honest, or because they are unaware of the fork, or do not understand how Bitcoin transactions work  


That's not how Bitcoin works. Transactions cause value transfer. Any person with a copy of any signed transaction can send that transaction to a Bitcoin node. If all the transaction inputs are unspent, the node will accept the transaction, and it will be propagated to other nodes, and to miners, then it will be mined  
Using my Tshirt transaction as an example, the recipient of a "lost" transaction can send the transaction to a Bitcoin node  
On a greater scale, a benevolent node operator can collect every lost transaction from the deleted blocks, and add them to his own node's mempool. Most of them will be mined on the new chain fork, assuming he moves quickly

The frustration of wasting time fixing typos - compile, error message, edit, compile - is an incentive to make fewer typos. That's how it worked for me in early coding days. Some coders never improve their typo rate, because they have a higher frustration threshold. Also, coding isn't like writing comments in Reddit, it's not straight typing. Most of the time, blocks are copied and pasted from elsewhere and changed to fit the new context - copy, paste, change five words - it's so fast  
That's the mundane part  
More important are the typos which are not picked up by the compiler because the code appears valid. I've seen debugging teams waste hours before noticing that two similarly named variables were the wrong way around. Ironically, these errors are often the result of the copy/paste method of speeding up the typing drudge work. Sometimes these errors persist for years, not picked up in testing

Interesting view  
I've always preferred the huge list of addresses approach, but the "state of the art" is to xpub a set of HD addresses. The problem with HD is the address gap limit, which is more or less a problem in every implementation, requires manual intervention to unplug the gap  
A list of millions (not 1000) of addresses can be stored in a small DB, each address initially unmarked, then marked with the sale it was presented for, and only used once - even if no payment arrived  
The gap problem can be solved by adding every HD address to a DB as it is created. Driving the payment matching from the DB avoids the gap problem. Using the DB for payment matching is the same process in each case. The difference is that the "bunch of addresses" method requires pre-populating the DB with sufficient addresses to cover future sales, and repopulating it before the addresses run out

The default setting for minimum fee for transaction relay is 1 Sat  / byte. Last time I tried to send low-fee transactions, every node I tried would reject the transaction with a "minimum relay fee" rejection message, unless I set the fee to 1Sat / byte. 190 Satoshis works for a 190-byte tx, 225 Satoshis works for a 225-byte tx  
There might be a small number of nodes with a minimum fee lower than 1 Sat / byte, but then they have to relay to their neighbour nodes, and then the transaction eventually has to get to a mining pool's node  
A similar discussion recently discussed the possibility of setting up a small mining pool for zero-fee transactions - maybe a pool with enough hash rate to mine 2 blocks per month  
A few months ago, Litecoin reduced the minimum relay fee to 1 Litoshi / byte, meaning Litecoin minimum fees are 99% lower than Bitcoin fees

Read the privacy page:  
  
On the Blockchain, the only information is the address and amount  
The general principle is that the address on the Blockchain is anonymous in itself. The risks to anonymity are exposure of the address off the Blockchain. Someone posts to "help my transaction is taking too long to confirm" with the txID, and there's a permanent link on a public forum connecting that transaction's addresses to a Reddit username. "Please donate" addresses are worse - public exposure and address reuse together. Exposure and reuse reduce the privacy of all transaction participants, not only the lazy address publisher/reuser  
Otherwise, even if everybody hides their addresses and never reuses, the other party to a transaction knows the details you supplied during the transaction. If you buy socks for Bitcoin, the merchant knows your delivery address. If you buy a VPN service, you can supply a false name and single-use email address and the VPN company knows only your IP address and makes a promise not to store this  
If the address belongs to an exchange, the exchange has already supplied the ID, personal details and Bitcoin addresses of their customer - to the FBI, IRS, and any other authority who asks for it

Easy?  
I do this now. I own my own domain name (several domains), and run my own mail server. I create a new email address for every new contact. This part is easy - just add one new line at the bottom of a list. There is no crossover - but that's because I handcraft every reply message, no instant "click and reply", it's time-consuming  
This still has privacy leaks. The service provider which provides the VPN where I run my mail server has my real identity because they insist on a passport scan for all new customers. They discard the scan image after 6 weeks, but they still know who I am. They know that the IP address which resolves to my mail server's DNS names is the IP address of the VPS service they rent me  
The provider even put my name and home address in the RIPE whois database for my VPN's IP address. They're in the EU, so my personal details are no longer in the whois database, thanks to the GDPR  
Domain names themselves are another source of privacy leak. Domain name registrars now have a privacy option (extra fee), but then you have to trust the registrar's privacy service not to reveal the hidden forwarding address  
Not easy to learn the skills to register your own domain, and administer your own DNS server and mail server. Easy after you learn it. Worth learning  
For throwaway email addresses, where you need to receive a confirmation token to sign up with an online service, I love   
and for a full fake name/address/phone identity, their other service

I suspect the $0.05 power price reference is a mistake on the Web page, doesn't inspire confidence. But lots of businesses have badly written Web pages. On balance, I'd take their $50 monthly, no extra charges, at face value. There are risks in sending equipment to a small startup business in a distant country like Kazakhstan, and hoping they'll be honest and diligent about plugging it into power and network. Aside from that, it's a great service idea - your equipment, controlled by you, mining in whichever pool you choose, and hosted for a fixed monthly fee at their data centre. Better than all the "cloud mining" contract scams  
Antminers are not known for reliability. Nearly all of them break, burn out one or more chips in their short lives. Kazakhstan is a long way to go to repair your damaged Antminer  
**EDIT**  
After extra thought, it appears the $0.05 part is a distraction. They have calculated it in reverse by dividing the monthly power consumption of a S9 into their $50 fee. Presumably their actual power costs are much lower than $0.05

A Bitcoin address does not have a balance. This is more than a semantic issue. You can not spend the "balance" of an address. You can only spend unspent TX outputs  
Also, addresses should never be reused, so any address should only have one TX output on the Blockchain, and every TX output is linked back from either zero or one subsequent TX input

A for-profit corporation needs "public officers", or whatever the legal term is in each country. The minimum is 2 in some countries, 3 in others. Australia only requires a single director. I'm not familiar with USA company laws. The old laws in Australia (and probably in a lot of other British-law jurisdictions) was a minimum of 2 shareholders, and a minimum paid share value of $1 per share - hence the $2 shelf company - and a minimum of 2 "public officers". This led to a lot of home businesses being husband and wife as both shareholders and directors. Australia recognised that a lot of small corporations were actually one-person businesses and changed the law to allow the $1 shelf company with one director and one shareholder. Although the term is "public officer", I'm talking about private companies. The law does not require a private company to disclose its shareholders. The public officers have to be listed on an open registry. So, a $1 shelf company can be owned by a single person, and appoint the local suburban attorney as the public officer. Pay the lawyer his fees every year, he files the annual company return, and as long as he keeps confidentiality, the company owner is secret  
A trust is different, but again, the beneficiaries' identities can be kept secret, and the trustees have to be known, at least to the tax authorities  
An incorporated non-profit, like the local amateur football team, also has to be registered in order to benefit from limited liability. Again, public officers are required. Normally the members choose chair, secretary and treasurer, but the organisation can appoint an outsider instead, as long as they can afford the professional fees  
Charity, similar to registered non-profit, but with extra rules if it wants to benefit from tax exemptions for donors

You don't need a cold wallet or a paper wallet at all then  
For small amounts, just use a hot wallet  
Or, a halfway option would be to import your paper address into Electrum when you want to spend some bitcoins, create a new paper wallet for the change address, burn the old paper wallet  
Don't let Electrum choose the change address. Use "paytomany" and make sure you send the correct amounts to the merchant address, the change address and especially make sure the fee is only about 0.00000250 Bitcoin  
Importing an address into electrum  
  
Import, do not sweep. Because you're spending the imported coin immediately, there is no advantage in sweeping. Sweeping just means more fees

*    transfer unsigned transaction to offline computer using media or using QR code and camera

A long time in the future, as pointed out by the comment  
Bitcoin is 10 years old and the cost of the HDD space to store it is less than $10  
The real elephant in the room is the time required for Blockchain initialisation. Each release of Core improves the processing time incrementally, but it keeps getting slower as the Blockchain gets bigger  
**This is the main disincentive to setting up a new Bitcoin node**  
The Blockchain initialisation process could be orders of magnitude faster if it was rewritten as a series of sorting processes. Sorting and sequential processing from HDD to HDD benefits from the blocking and buffering of HDD data, reducing the number of physical reads and writes because the amount of data in a physical HDD block is much greater than the logical data being processed by the software. The processing time falls by 99% or more - for each sort, and for each sequential scan/rewrite  
The disadvantage of this approach is that it requires at least 2 separate full copies of the Blockchain while it is being initialised, on 2 separate HDD  
Which brings the discussion back to your elephant. If the Blockchain was smaller, a sorting process for Blockchain initialisation would be cheap and fast  
In the Satoshi White Paper, Section 7 describes a pruning method which has never been implemented. To understand this, you have to understand the Merkle tree mechanism in a Bitcoin block, and the purpose of the Merkle root hash in the block header:  
*    after a block has been buried deep enough  
*    after all the outputs of a transaction have been spent  
*    delete the transaction from its block  
*    replace the deleted transaction with its tx ID hash  
*    when 2 adjacent transactions have been deleted, replace their hashes with the Merkle hash of the 2 hashes  
*    repeat for pairs of Merkle hashes, all the way up the Merkle tree, replacing each pair with the Merkle hash of the pair  
*    over time, all the transactions in a block become fully spent and deleted, the Merkle branch hashes gradually disappear, until all that's left is the block header, containing the Merkle root hash  
Blocks are linked by their header hashes. Transactions are not directly hashed into the block header hash. The block header contains the Merkle root hash, which is calculated from the Merkle tree of transaction hashes. This means that a block's hash can still be verified if a transaction is deleted and replaced by its hash. The Merkle tree is the same after deleting the transaction as it was before  
**EDIT:** Literally, the Merkle root hash is calculated from the 2 Merkle branch hashes at the top of the Merkle tree  
The White Paper says that this pruning method means that the Blockchain grows only by the size of the block headers, 80 bytes per block  
Actually, the Blockchain's pruned size will also grow as the UTXO set grows. A transaction can not be pruned until all its outputs have been spent. A lost coin is a UTXO that can never be spent. This means UTXO growth is unbounded - another elephant in the room, a very tiny baby elephant. UTXO bloat will not be a significant problem for many decades

The layoffs were to remove the toy branches of the company, to return focus to its core products  
The IPO failed because demand collapsed exactly when Bitmain solved the problem of not being able to supply market demand, followed by 10 months of selling below cost - bad planning or unlucky timing? Either way, the losses are too great to attract IPO investors  
Now, with few competitors, and the competitors unable to produce enough devices to meet demand, Bitmain has new products, and still has a near monopoly  
During the 2017 sales boom, Bitmain could not make enough devices to meet demand. People were pre-ordering extra devices, receiving delivery, then selling on the secondary market for 100% markup when Bitmain were telling people to wait 6 weeks for the next production batch  
Bitmain could have managed the supply problem by setting prices high enough to have stock always available, could have avoided giving away profit to opportunist resellers  
and ...  
The new management should recognise that using their own devices for mining is a conflict of interest - not just ethically, but it is also higher risk than selling devices. Financially, it doesn't make sense for Bitmain to use their own devices for mining when they don't produce enough devices to meet demand

This  
And the alts mentioned would suffer the same bloat you predict in your OP  
Since this is a thought experiment,  
why not expand the view?
Instead of a dominant coin, and a small selection of popular alts (the 2017 status quo), it would make more sense to imagine a cryptocurrency ecology of thousands of different currencies

1. They're excluded during relay, a node will refuse to add a double-spend to its mempool  
1. They're excluded by miners. If two double-spend transactions are in separate node mempools, a miner will include one transaction and reject the other, because a miner can not afford to lose the mining reward when the node network rejects his block which contains double-spending  
1. If there is a failure in the pre-mining checks described above, and a miner attempts to propagate a block containing double-spends, then all the nodes will reject the block and it will never be added to the Blockchain. This is where consensus happens. This is the most important part, because it prevents corruption of the Blockchain  
All the above assumes no bugs  
There was a bug, recently fixed, which allowed double-spending the same UTXO multiple times in a single transaction

Satoshi designed it that way and it works well  
The TXID is a single field which serves as a unique key for every transaction in the Blockchain  
Using two fields - block height + counting number - is more complicated than using one  
A block is a collection of unrelated transactions. Using the block height to identify a transaction creates a false relationship between the transactions in a block  
The Bitcoin white paper Section 7 Reclaiming Disk Space describes a pruning method which has not yet been implemented. This pruning method would be more difficult to implement if transactions were referenced by block height + counting number

You mentioned this in your original post, in passing. The wallet does this part, so it is outside the scope of "questions about Blockchain"  
There are a few different methods used by different wallets, but the basic principle is the same. A new node gets initialized by scanning the entire 11 years of Blockchain, storing a transaction in the wallet file every time the initialization process finds a transaction relevant to the wallet's addresses - both receiving transactions and spending transactions. Ongoing, the wallet scans every new block as it arrives, to discover any new transactions relevant to the wallet. As a node operator, my wallet scans my copy of the Blockchain to build a list of my transactions. The wallet balance is simply the sum of the unspent coins in those transactions  
Many people use "light wallets" instead of running their own nodes. The process of maintaining transaction history is the same, except that the light wallet has to ask one or more full nodes to discover the light wallet's transactions and send them to be stored in the light wallet

Coal is the answer  
The reason it is cheap is related to the investment economics of building power generators, combined with the incredible growth in China's manufacturing sector  
If there is insufficient power, manufacturing growth is delayed while waiting for the power infrastructure. To prevent this, China builds approximately 1GW of new generating capacity per month  
The downside of having the generating capacity ahead of demand is that the generating plant has a delay between being commissioned and being able to sell sufficient power to cover minimal operating costs. It's cheaper to run a coal power plant than to shut it down and wait for demand. Find a power-hungry, easy relocatable industry and offer the power at a loss. The plant is running anyway, losing money. Sell the power for 2 cents and make a smaller loss. In the long term, these losses are easily covered by future profits. The generator has an economic lifespan of 40-50 years

The most sensitive component of the Blockchain process is that every 10 minutes a new block has to be distributed to every node of a network of several thousand nodes. This is time sensitive because if the propagation is not complete before the next block is mined, a bottleneck could arise, preventing new blocks being added to the chain  
Receiving a new block and passing it to other nodes is not instantaneous. When a node receives a newly-mined block, it has to verify every transaction in the block - verify that the transaction inputs have not been previously spent, and verify that the crypto signatures match the public keys, and the public keys match the addresses of the unspent outputs of earlier transactions. This has to be repeated for every transaction in a block, about 1900 transactions. In order to minimise the delay caused by all these verifications, the Bitcoin Core software reduces disk accesses by holding a lot of data in RAM, the data which is required to verify any transactions likely to appear in the next block. This use of RAM to optimise the processing time for block verification means that a Bitcoin node needs at least 2GB of RAM. Doubling the blocksize will mean that nodes with 2GB-4GB of RAM will be doing a lot more disk access to verify transactions. The minimum RAM requirement for processing blocks quickly will increase to 8GB  
The practical effect of increasing the RAM requirement is that many existing nodes will drop out of the Bitcoin network, and the increased hardware cost of setting up a new node will reduce the pool of people willing to implement new nodes. The decrease in the number of nodes increases the risk that the Bitcoin network will become centralised. Centralising the node network will destroy the trust that Bitcoin users have that the Blockchain is being maintained honestly

Go back through a few years history of Fed cases of LocalBitcoins sellers in various Bitcoin blog sites. The local FBI gets a LocalBitcoins account, chooses the biggest local seller, makes a few trades, makes a casual remark that the Bitcoin is for laundering cash from drug sales. After some months, the Bitcoin seller is charged with operating a money services business without registering, and the drug mention allows them to claim money laundering as well  
In one case, the seller was keeping his transactions under USD10000 because of the reporting requirements. He had an agreement with a buyer to sell Bitcoin for USD9200 and the buyer (undercover Federal agent) sent USD14500, and also told him the cash was from selling drugs  
There are four or five cases which follow this pattern  


Selling drugs for Bitcoin and then selling Bitcoin for millions in cash by mail - that makes both parties conspirators in money laundering  
Otherwise, if you're not making a business from selling Bitcoin (without being FinCen registered) and you're not dealing with "I sell drugs" undercover Federal agents, then it is mostly not illegal to exchange cash for Bitcoin in person  
If you are FinCen registered, then you have compliance obligations - AML/ATF risk management, KYC, reporting every transaction greater than USD10k, reporting any other suspicions transactions

False, it is not optional  
Also not optional is the so-called network fee. When I send a transaction I pay the transaction fee. The merchant has no right to charge me an extra fee

Ninety percent of BitPay merchants abandon Bitcoin after 6 months. There's no adoption if the merchant knows nothing about Bitcoin  
You have ignored the other issues too

The ledger is maintained mainly by non-mining nodes  
Nodes are operated for zero financial reward, for altruistic motives  
The main purpose of mining is to govern the frequency at which new blocks are added to the chain  
Minting new coins is a secondary purpose of mining  
When all the coins have been minted,  
the requirement to control the rate of creation of new blocks will remain the same  
Mining nodes are rewarded by the block reward, and by fees

Described below the heading "4. Proof-of-Work" in the original bitcoin.pdf paper  
Satoshi's clarity of words is sheer genius  
Here is a poor attempt at paraphrasing  
- Repeatedly execute a SHA-256 calculation until the result begins with the correct number of leading zero bits  
- The SHA-256 calculation is performed on the new block being added to the blockchain  
- Each repetition of the SHA-256 calculation is slightly different by the addition of an incrementing counter (jargon word "nonce") to the block data  
- The number of leading zero bits required to "win the race" is automatically adjusted to maintain an average 10 minute period between blocks  
The beauty of this method is that the winning result is instantly verifiable by everybody in the network, just by performing one SHA-256 calculation  


No, it is generating billions of hashes on slightly different variations of the block, a brute force method to discover a hash with the correct number of leading zero bits  
** EDIT **  
Pedantic mode on ...  
Some comments in this thread are using the word random, or the dice analogy  
The result of a SHA-256 hashing calculation is not random, it is deterministic  
It is practically as good as random, since the winning hash is unpredictable during the race  
** EDIT **  
My Satoshi quotes and leading zero count are not an accurate description of the actual method of determining the winning block  
As sos755 pointed out this method would only allow the difficulty factor to change by a power of 2  
As others in this thread have described, the actual condition for winning the race is a hash with an integer value below the level prescribed by the current difficulty factor, which changes every 2016 blocks  
The number of leading zero bits is not the same as this, but is a rough approximation

No, this amendment is not about banks reporting transactions with Bitcoin exchanges  
It will require Bitcoin exchanges to register with the regulator, Austrac, and report the transactions of their customers  
The law requires banks and money exchanges to report cash transactions which meet certain criteria - over 10,000 or otherwise "suspicious"  
Some years ago, the regulators reported that informal money remittance businesses operating out of main street grocery stores (sometimes referred to as Hawala) were not covered by the law, and therefore were a potential channel for money laundering

Mostly, it won't work, because nodes will reject a double-spend even if the original is unconfirmed, still in mempool  


Yes, it's this too, and because you control your wallet, there are workarounds to prevent your wallet from blocking your double spend  
How to double-spend (replace) an unconfirmed non-RBF transaction:  
Mostly, you can not, because most nodes run Core and Core is coded to block non-RBF double-spends. They refuse to relay because there is already a transaction in mempool which spends one or more of the same inputs  
Exceptions:  
*    Broadcast to a node which does not enforce this mempool rule. This is the most difficult option, because I've never been able to find any nodes which allow non-RBF replacements  
*    Broadcast to a node which does not have the original transaction in its mempool. Every node has a slightly different set of transactions in its mempool, so there is a chance that some nodes do not have the original transaction. This is a lot of trial and error work, because it is impossible to view the mempools of all nodes, and because most nodes are well enough connected that they have nearly all the same transactions. I have had some luck posting via the chain.so API. For whatever reason, its node was missing the original transaction, and accepted the replacement  
*    The easiest option - wait. Node mempools have a limited size, and an age rule. Eventually, some nodes, and then more and more nodes, will lose the original transaction (if it is still unconfirmed). Then it will be easy to submit the replacement. Obviously, the longer you wait, the more likely the original will confirm. Also obviously, if you're replacing the transaction because it's urgent, waiting is not compatible with urgency. But then, if it was urgent you would have selected RBF originally  
Side note: if you ever have a transaction which does not get confirmed after a few weeks, it is possible for anybody to keep an archive of old, unconfirmed transactions and add an old transaction to a mempool at any time in the future. To prevent this, always send at least one of the transaction inputs to yourself - after the original, unconfirmed transaction disappears from the mempools

Your starting point: Bitcoin has no intrinsic value  
Then read the first page of the Bitcoin white paper  
Bitcoin was created for a purpose ...  
People use centrally-controlled payment services - Visa, PayPal, etc. These payment services are regulated. It is easy for Governments to regulate payment services because they are centrally controlled. Regulation includes banning some transactions. If a real-world store bans Visa cards for buying something, you can use cash. You can not use cash to buy something from an Internet store. Bitcoin is like cash that can be used in an Internet store  
In an economy, every transaction has a value to the economy. Every time somebody pays for something with Bitcoin because Visa and PayPal ban a transaction, the world is more wealthy because that transaction happened. This is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin  
Another example: I use a VPN service to protect my privacy on the Internet. The VPN service is in another country, so I can not pay cash. I do not want to use PayPal or Visa because they know my identity, so my VPN use is not private. I pay for my VPN with Bitcoin. Bitcoin's intrinsic value derives from my freedom to use the Internet privately because of this VPN payment  
Bitcoin's intrinsic value for these uses, and a few others, is probably between $1 and $2

Reddit tip: double space at the end of a line creates a line break  
Proof is not the issue. If law enforcement have your phone number and they want to find out who you are, they only need to send you a SMS - "You have inherited $400,000 from a distant relative. Please contact us now to verify your identity" or "You have won a prize". Everybody falls for these. US  Marshals and bounty hunters use them all the time  
More interesting: along the lines of the post by Jameson Lopp a few weeks ago, can you use a throwaway phone number for these one-time-code SMS messages?  
See   
Can you buy the anonymous phone number anonymously or do you have to use a credit card? Will the service you're signing up with accept one of these throwaway phone numbers?

2GB is enough for a Bitcoin node. That's what my laptop node has  
The thing with the 4GB Pi is that the price is only marginally higher than the 2GB model, so few people are choosing the 2GB version  
As for crashing, do not set up swap space, especially if you intend to initialize the node on the Pi. If the RAM overflows into swap, the slower speed of disk-based swap is bad for a Bitcoin node  
Know that you will be waiting about 10-15 days for the initial build if you use the Pi. Most Pi Bitcoin node operators build their node on a fast PC, then transfer the files to the Pi for day-to-day operation

Every transaction includes a fee payable to the miner who mines a new block  
Until recently fees have been tiny  
Through this year, they have increased through 30 cents, 60 cents, $1, and recently $5 - from a few Satoshi per byte to 600 Satoshi per byte  
The fee is generally a reflection of the fullness of blocks - you pay more to get into a block sooner because there are lots of transactions queued up  
There is a conspiracy myth among some members of this subreddit that blocks were full because they were being spammed with useless transactions by miners, to corruptly force higher fees  
For about 4 days now, it has been possible to successfully submit transactions with fees below 30 Satoshi per byte

The scaling problem is not the same as the size of the Blockchain, or the time it takes to initialise a new node  
The scaling problem is about how many transactions can be processed  
Anyway, the size of the chain and the initialisation time is an interesting topic ...  


and the Blockchain is 153 GB,  
so download time less than 4 hours  
(1,314,259,992,576 bits / 100,000,000 bits/sec = 13,142 seconds)  
Therefore, it's not the size of the Blockchain nor the speed of your network which is causing the initial setup of your node to take 3 days
The 3 days is required for some part of Core software to read every block, every transaction, verify the hashes, and build indexes for various lookups - index blocks by transaction ID, transactions by address, UTXO, (what else goes here?)  
Worth noting that a recent improvement to Core only verifies hashes for the most recent blocks, as many or as few as you want to check:  
  
That just leaves the index build. Why does it take 3 days? Can it be improved to make it faster? Why isn't Core rewriting this code to make it run in a few hours maximum?  
* Why does it take 3 days?  
    *    Because it does. The code is essentially unchanged for a few years, some optimisations to make it about 60% faster than it used to be, and it is reliable  
* Can it be improved to make it faster?  
    *    Probably could be rewritten from scratch as a multi-step sort/merge process, possibly can be reduced to 1-2 hours  
* Why isn't Core rewriting this code to make it run in a few hours maximum?  
    *    Why should they? If I think this is worth doing, why haven't I done it already, and submitted my code to Core for testing? Or you, or some other coder. This would require a lot of time, and especially a lot of careful testing to make sure it produces exactly the same result as the existing, well-tested code  
There are other discussions about reducing the Blockchain size, but since it's only a 4-hour download, and hard disk space is cheap, that issue can wait another year or two

Also, the bitcoin-cli RPC API is much richer than it appears on the surface, although it's primarily aimed at day-to-day wallet management, would not be an efficient way to scan the entire Blockchain

There are many answers  
As other people said, RBF allows a low-fee transaction to be replaced in the mempools with a higher-fee transaction. This option is only available if the RBF flag was activated in the original transaction  
Child pays for parent (CPFP) is another option. Most transactions pay someone and also send change to the sender. You can spend the change output (usually to yourself) in a new transaction before your low-fee transaction is confirmed. If the CPFP fee is high enough, then both the low-fee transaction and the CPFP transaction will be confirmed in the same block. Or the merchant can CPFP his transaction output, if he wants your low-fee transaction to confirm more quickly  
Every node has its own mempool, with a different amount of memory allocated to it, depending on the amount of memory available on the computer. If a node's mempool is never full, then the node expires unconfirmed transactions after a defined time. The default value for expiry is 14 days. Most node operators use this default. If the mempool gets full, then low-fee transactions will be removed to make space for new transactions. This typically happens after about 3 days - the actual time depends on the rate of new transactions, fee amounts, and the maximum size of a node's mempool  
Can it be respent? While an unconfirmed transaction is still in a node's mempool, the node will reject any non-RBF replacement transaction with a message "already in mempool". After the unconfirmed transaction has expired from a node's mempool, you can send a new transaction to "respend". If some nodes have expired the transaction and some have not, it could be difficult for a replacement transaction to be propagated well enough to get to a miner. Often this means waiting 4 days instead of 3. Also, if you're feeling cheap, you can rebroadcast the original transaction with the same low fee and wait another 3-4 days  
What if you do nothing? There's a common misunderstanding that the transaction is "sent back to your wallet" after it expires from nodes' mempools. What can happen is that anybody can make a copy of a signed, unconfirmed transaction - node operators, miners, random Bitcoin enthusiasts - and rebroadcast the transaction, maybe years later. To avoid this surprise, you should respend. You only need to spend one of the transaction's inputs (usually to yourself) and the original transaction becomes impossible to confirm

A wallet has many keys  
You can extract all the keys from a Core wallet.dat using dumpwallet, as said  
But you can not recover the wallet using the keys in dumpwallet backup, unless you create a non-standard wallet and import all the keys into it  
The main risk with this is that you may not have dumped all the keys, depending on whether you had Bitcoin transactions after you created the dumpwallet  
In theory you only need the seed key to recover a Core wallet.dat  
This is the first key in the key list  
In practice, nobody has developed any app for recovering a Core wallet.dat from the seed key  
This is because everybody knows it's easier to restore wallet.dat from a backup  
But good luck if you want to go in a different direction, especially if you develop a Core wallet recovery tool yourself

The current practice of selecting transactions by highest fee is artificial, because the fee reward is so much lower than the block reward  
This could be addressed by setting up new mining pools with the purpose of selecting transactions by age, ignoring fees  
With enough hash power, the mere existence of such pools would ensure that even zero-fee transactions would be verified within a few hours  


IMO ...  
A bug, in the sense that transaction fees were originally intended to become a mining incentive after the block reward declined to near zero  
With the block reward still extremely generous at 12.5,  
the norm should be zero-fee transactions,  
and miners selecting transactions in the order they're received

Pools do not have to be centralized in the way blocks are mined. Miners can choose the transactions for their blocks. The pool's role would then be limited to collating the shares of pool members and distributing rewards. A "Chinese mining pool" has thousands of members, mostly not located in China  


No  
Not that it matters. The solution to concentration of mining pools is to distribute the function of collecting transactions. Pools can stop doing this part of mining, delegate it to the miners. Then all miners can choose the transactions for their blocks, and be free from the hostile State influence proposed in your concern post. Accurate distribution of mining rewards by pools does not require the pool manager to choose the transactions, does not require all pool members to mine the same block

The test for Bitcoin is to survive regulation by boycotting all the regulated businesses. If KYC makes it near-impossible to safely purchase Bitcoin from an exchange, the obvious response is to trade freely between friends and acquaintances, on a non-profit basis. Right now, nobody seems to be interested in building a real person-to-person market  
It should be possible for liquidity to exist in an informal market through the six degrees principle. Merchants need to convert Bitcoin to fiat. Customers need to buy Bitcoin for fiat. Right now, both sides of this money flow cycle are using regulated exchanges  
If this does not change to person-to-person, eliminating the middleman, Bitcoin will become surveillance money, just like fiat. Nobody will have any reason to use it  


The problem is worse than this. We should fear mass surveillance by the authoritarian bureaucrats pulling the strings of the lawmakers. Nobody voted these jackboots into government. We need to expel the coward politicians and replace them with courageous representatives who refuse the bureaucrats' demand for more surveillance

Pre-confirmation Bitcoin transaction timing is meaningless. In a real fraudulent double-spend, the sender will have his send-to-self double-spend ready to go, and will send it to the Bitcoin network simultaneously with the legitimate transaction, within a few seconds at the latest. In this case, roughly half the mempools will have one transaction and half will have the other, because timing is determined by network latency. Both transactions are "first" in different mempools. The fraud will only succeed if the fraud transaction is confirmed, and if the merchant fails to wait for confirmation

More nonsense from clueless academics  


OK  


Not likely. The flaw in this argument is the "us and them" characterisation - the mining pools are in China, therefore they all have the same interests, therefore they will cooperate to destroy Bitcoin. Academic racism  


The fallacy here is - because it happens in China, the Government can control it. More academic racism  
Also technically false - completed blocks are propagated automatically when discovered by one of the pool's miners, not selectively by the pool manager. Yes, the program which propagates the new block is operated by the pool manager, but the pool has no means of choosing not to propagate a newly found block. There is no time for human intervention. Any delay will give the block reward to a competing pool  


Here it is again, stated explicitly  
The blatant fallacy here is - mining pools control miners. There are hundreds of thousands of miners in the "Chinese" mining pools, and most of them are not in China. If there was authoritarian coercion of pool managers, the miners would most likely abandon those pools  
Yes, the concentration of pool managers in China is a centralisation issue. Currently, the pools do not censor which transactions get included in a block, except that transaction fees influence choice of transactions, as they always have  
Mining centralisation issues are mostly mitigated by the fact that miners are independent operators. If a pool becomes corruptly managed, the miners will choose a different pool

Making money online will change to a true peer-to-peer publisher-to-reader economy  
No registration, no signups, just click and pay  
A Satoshi here, 5 Satoshis there, all instant and anonymous  
No more YouTube, I make a video, you have a micro-Bitcoin wallet plugin in your browser, you pay a few Satoshis, or a few million Satoshis to download my video from my own server  
No more news publishing companies, a journalist writes a story, readers can choose to pay to read it, a fraction of a cent, a few cents, many dollars, price determined by demand  
Same for TV and movies and books  
The viewer or reader directly pays the maker or author  
Most payments will be small enough to be automatic. If you don't want to be interrupted by hundreds of "Click to Pay" requests, you can configure your browser-plugin wallet to automatically pay payments below a threshold, up to a daily or monthly limit, with progress reporting to tell you how much you've spent  
Outside those limits, just Click and pay to watch Deadpool 6 for 8 cents, download to own, no DRM

The original Bitcoin paper proposed something neater in section 7  
Full history is not required  
As you suggest, UTXO are the important parts of the Blockchain,  
and it is probably necessary to keep every transaction which still has one or more UTXO  
Every transaction which is fully spent could be removed from the Blockchain, keeping transaction hashes in order to validate all the block hashes, and the chained block hashes validating all prior blocks back to the genesis block  
It is important to keep the most recent several months of full history, to provide a buffer for possible reorgs  
This option would provide sufficient history to prove every UTXO, and keeping the hashes of purged transactions would validate all the block hashes

@_date: 2018-10-25 05:16:12
This is answered in Section 8 of the white paper  
Having all the block headers proves that all the block hashes are valid, because of the use of prev_hash for linking blocks  
And then, validating a transaction only requires validating its TXID hash, and validating the Merkle root hash in the block header, and all the Merkle branch hashes between the root and the transaction being verified  
So, you're able to calculate the block header hash of the block containing your transaction. You're able to prove that the Merkle root hash in the block header has an untampered relationship to your transaction hash, and you're able to hash the transaction to prove its hash

* protecting anonymity with VPN and similar network services

The question you're asking only has complicated answers. The answer I gave was the simple version  
The issue of randomness in computers is "nobody really knows, but here is the most random pseudo-random technique we can devise right now" and then you need to study the details of the 2 software techniques in that program - OpenSSL and OS - then you need to study the technique your OS uses, which could be difficult if you use a secret-source OS like Windows or MacOS  
If the OS RNG is using mouse activity or keyboard activity, then you need to read expert opinions about whether mouse movements and keyboard key presses are really random or are they so predictable that your Bitcoin secret key can be guessed by brute force. The short answer is - opinions differ, but anything which relies on human activity is a lot more predictable than people think  
If you've spent the money on a hardware RNG, the manufacturer should tell you how it derives randomness - quantum mechanics?  
Then complicate everything a bit more by hashing the pseudo-random and making it harder to brute force, but how much harder? And nobody really knows how evenly random is the output of a hashing algorithm - see the history of the MD5 and SHA1 algorithms  
Personally, I use a hardware random number generator. It photographs low-paid office workers in third-world countries tossing coins. The device uses image recognition to detect heads or tails. It is very slow

You use your private key to sign the transaction. Only the signed transaction is sent to the network, not the key, and  


Use an offline computer to sign the transaction with your private key. Use a non-network method to copy the signed transaction to an online computer. Send the signed transaction  
More here:  
  


Most articles about offline signing tell people to copy the transaction to a USB flash drive, then unplug the flash drive and plug it into the online computer  
People who are concerned about the risks of using USB flash drives will display the signed transaction as a QR code, and copy it to the online computer by pointing a camera at the offline computer's screen. Most transactions are small enough to fit easily into a QR code

A bit hard to explain completely because the OP is too ignorant to explain his problem properly  
Bitcoin wallets have several addresses and each address has a private key. The wallet receives notifications when new Bitcoin arrives and keep the the balance up to date. Each address has a private key associated. When you spend Bitcoin the wallet uses the private key to sign the transaction, to prove you own it  
It is possible to set up a wallet which contains only addresses and no private keys. If you know the addresses of a few friends and family, you could make a wallet with their addresses and know when they are receiving or spending Bitcoin to and from those addresses. This is referred to as a watching-only wallet. Because you know the addresses but not the private keys, you can see the transactions but you can not spend the money  
The part which is unclear:  
The OP appears to be the victim of a common scam - "invest in mining". He sent money to a scammer for a fake mining investment scheme. The scammer put a bunch of addresses into a watching-only wallet to make the victim believe he has money. The "Non-Spendable" tag means the address is watching-only  
There is another scam which offers a gift - "here is your wallet with 0.9 Bitcoin in it". The wallet is watching-only, so the 0.9 is marked Non-Spendable. The scammer says the minimum withdrawal amount "to make it spendable" is 1 Bitcoin. The victim sends 0.1 Bitcoin and receives nothing

The likely structure discussed in earlier threads is that ordinary users will not be setting up chains, that the network will organise around a small number of high value chains. That is, setting up a chain will require a significant commitment of capital for the duration of the chain  
In this scenario, on-chain transaction fees (your term - miner fees) will be insignificant relative to the value of the chain  
More accurately, on-chain transaction fees will be one of the constraints that make chains viable only if they are high value  
Who will risk the necessary capital to set up a chain?  
The "usual suspects": VISA, PayPal, Amazon, Google, Apple  
Most of your trust arguments then become unimportant, since these corporations have vast experience hedging against exchange rate fluctuations in their existing payment processing businesses
Unfortunately, this scenario brings us right back into the centralisation trap Bitcoin was designed to avoid

This is interesting  
The general answer to both questions - non-RBF replacement, and relaying where the fee is less than 1 Sat/byte - is that (nearly) everybody runs the same pre-consensus code, even though (in principle) Bitcoin only requires every node to have the same consensus rules  
Would be interesting to have a set of nodes, and a mining pool, with different relaying rules for unconfirmed transactions

Go for it  
Also consider implementing Satoshi's pruning from Day 1, and think about coin expiry  
Satoshi pruning deletes transactions after all their outputs are spent. This limits the Blockchain size to the size of the Block headers, plus unspent transaction outputs  
Coin expiry would prevent Blockchain bloat from lost coins which can never be spent. Currently in Bitcoin, lost coins cause unbounded long-term UTXO growth  
As most of your coins will be LN channels, unbounded UTXO growth could be caused by abandoned channels

There will not be an instant, massive shift in hashing power from one coin to another because then the profitability advantage would be instantly wiped out by the extra hashing power

False  
The difficulty goes up when the hash rate increases, and goes down when the hash rate decreases, always calculated to maintain the average block interval at 10 minutes  
When power costs increase, mining becomes less profitable, miners leave, the hash rate falls, the difficulty falls, equilibrium is maintained

This is not relevant to Bitcoin  
Years ago, several banks introduced so-called "smart ATMs" which automatically count currency notes for cash deposits. One bank "forgot" to update its software systems to report suspicious cash deposits to the authorities. A few organised crime gangs became aware of this and used the smart ATMs to launder large amounts of cash  
The bank was prosecuted for failing to meet its AML obligations  
The bank has agreed to pay a fine for "forgetting" to implement the AML rules on the smart ATMs after the ATMs had been used for money laundering for several years

You can import or sweep individual keys  
The Core HD wallet is not compatible with Electrum HD wallets  
The Core wallet does not use BIP39 seed word lists  
In general, wallet developers do not support what you want to do. They design their apps assuming nobody will want to copy/move a wallet from app to app, or even from device to device. There are ways to do this, with some wallets, but these are complicated workarounds - except where 2 different wallet apps support BIP39 seed words and exactly the same HD derivation paths  
Even then, the wallet app will never work the way you expect it to if you have the same wallet keys in 2 different apps or devices. The wallet is not just a key manager

A lot of this discussion is biased to the present day status quo, too many people assuming that because Bitcoin has a fiat exchange price of $10,000 in 2019 therefore it was obvious in 2009-2011 that this would happen. It was not obvious. These beliefs are false  


Isn't this simply a question of timing? It's easy to imagine that the business partners set up a future-maturing trust just for fun, and maybe to learn how to shard keys and implement a maturity date. The bonded future delivery courier seems a bit extreme, or amusing at least. See final episode of Good Omens TV series for an extreme example of this practice  
Anyway, assume that the future-maturing sharded-key trust was set up for fun, **without** the expectation of the trust's coins being worth billions before maturity. Cutting ties, abandoning the coins would have been an easy decision, with Bitcoin still being priced below USD0.01. Abandon the trust as well

* A payment transaction would have a single input and two outputs, like the majority of merchant purchases today, one output for the recipient, one for change  
* A consolidation transaction has multiple inputs and one output, to solve the problem in your question  
and then  
Consolidation transactions could be zero-fee and high priority for block inclusion, for our convenience

There is a design outline for removing Bitcoin transactions (after they're fully spent) from their blocks, and replacing the transaction with its hash, then replacing Merkle pairs with their Merkle hash, as more and more fully spent transactions are deleted (or pruned)  
The block remains verifiable because the transaction hashes and Merkle hashes explicitly replace the pruned transactions in a way which does not change the Merkle root hash

Automatic fee estimation algorithms can only work when transaction demand is nearly always less than capacity. As mempools become more congested more often, automatic fee calculation will become less and less accurate  
Wallet developers will have to give up trying too hard to dumb down Bitcoin fees, and let the users choose their own fee for every transaction, based on their own urgency and understanding of the current congestion situation

Wait for confirmation  
Consider using child-pays-for-parent if the transaction is urgent  
The literal answer to your question is that unconfirmed transactions disappear after time. The time varies from node to node. A node with a small amount of memory dedicated to mempool (unconfirmed transaction set) will expire oldest, lowest-fee unconfirmed transactions when it needs free space for new transactions  
Otherwise, unconfirmed transactions expire according to value of mempoolexpiry. The default value is 336 hours  
An expired transaction is not returned to the sender or sent to the receiver. Nothing happens to it. A mischievous outsider might keep a copy of the unconfirmed transaction, and rebroadcast, possibly years later. To avoid this type of surprise, the sender should "spend" at least one of the transaction's inputs using a send-to-self transaction  
Also, as the recipient, you can keep a copy of the transaction and rebroadcast it if it expires from most nodes' mempools  
Child-pays-for-parent is a more reliable method for making the transaction confirm sooner

As said, BTCPay is really the only activity, and it is only recent, driven by the poor behaviour of BitPay  
Most merchants choose third-party payment services like BitPay, so there has been no demand for free, and there is still nothing free and simple along the lines of the Electrum merchant documentation  
  
Meanwhile the cycle is this:  
* merchant sets up web shop, chooses BitPay  
* merchant announces shop in * several voices object to the merchant's choice of BitPay, why aren't you running your own wallet  
* BitPay fans respond "It's good for adoption"  
* merchant responds "Where's a pointy-clicky, don't want to hire a coder, plugin for Shopify/Woocommerce?"

On a VPS, the disk storage is a file on the host server  
Cloud instances are VPS - although the disk is not necessarily on the same physical hosts as the CPU and RAM  
Somebody with access to the host server can copy the file containing any VPS's storage "disk"  
The VPS RAM is also available to an administrator with access to the host server  
Encryption can mitigate the disk risk, but ...  
Using a hot wallet requires decryption. Some wallet apps encrypt the individual keys, others encrypt the wallet file. Is the wallet in RAM while it is decrypted, or is it stored on disk?  
Linux shells keep command line history in RAM, and write to .bash_history on disk on logout. Do your shell commands contain any passwords or keys?  
These risks extend to dedicated servers also, but they are more difficult to access. Administrators can reboot your server in rescue mode and image the disk. You might notice your server went down for 5 minutes and rebooted

Never safe for backups, because flash memory is subject to sudden total failure even if it has been stored for a long time

This means making multiple copies, storing them in different places, regularly checking every copy and replacing bad copies with fresh copies  
Write the file to DVD-R, 4 copies. Check every copy every 3 months. Use a hash to verify that there is no "bitrot corruption". If any copy is corrupt, replace it immediately

As for any user, it's your choice to run a full node or rely on SPV  
With a full node, you make remote calls to the Core wallet's daemon  
With Electrum SPV, remote calls or Web sockets to the Electrum daemon  
Alternatively, run a full node and an Electrum server together, and then your Electrum wallet can connect to your own Electrum server - but this is just details. Your developer's coding job requires making remote calls to whichever wallet you're using, and parsing the results

A nonsense question  
The only thing which matters is that the key is secret, which means only one person can use the key to sign transactions. Ownership is not relevant, the spending mechanism is about control  
A Bitcoin coin has an address. The right to spend the coin is assigned to the person who knows the private key associated with the address. The signature generated with the private key is proof of the right to spend the coin

Further down the road, Bitcoin blocks will be full. It will reach its maximum transaction capacity. People will use other coins, to avoid waiting days for transaction confirmation and paying $15 transaction fees. There is a low barrier to entry for creating a new coin. Extrapolate further into the future - there are two coins sharing the transaction load, then two coins with full blocks and high fees, so then there are three coins ...  
New cryptocurrencies to mitigate Bitcoin's built-in transaction limit will arise as needed. Each new cryptocurrency adds more coins to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. No scarcity. No deflation

Your analogy is irrelevant to this discussion  
You asked about the weaknesses of Bitcoin and offered subscriptions as an example  
My point is that your subscription business model is a consequence of the weaknesses of the old payment methods you cling to - high transaction costs preventing pay-per-use with small amounts  
Bitcoin's strength is that its low transaction costs make it analogous to cash. Your subscription business can probably be modified to replace subscriptions with pay-per-use with low-value transactions - but that would require you to open your mind and have the courage to make the change  
The weakness is your reluctance to change, not Bitcoin's unsuitability to fit your old business model

There is a step-by-step in the Electrum documentation  
  
That manual suggests transferring the unsigned transaction from online to offline, and the signed transaction from offline to online, "e.g. with a usb stick"  
This avoids malware on the offline computer by keeping it offline  
Now how deep is the "how to absolutely avoid malware" rabbit hole?  
In earlier (2-3 years ago) versions of this question in this subreddit, people will warn you that USB thumb drives can be malware infected at the point of manufacture. This applies also to SD cards, SSD and HDD  
If your concern is at this level, make sure both computers have monitors and cameras and use QR codes to transfer the transactions. A QR can hold up to about 2800 bytes, although a lot of cameras can not capture a QR image well enough to decode if it contains more than about 800 bytes. The QR protocol allows for data to be split into multiple QR images. Also, most transactions are smaller than 800 bytes  
More  
How do you know your offline computer didn't get malware installed when you originally installed the OS? Or more likely, after you install the OS, you have to add a Bitcoin wallet app, QR decoding and encoding apps, and maybe apps and drivers for the camera, and an app for displaying the QR code on the monitor screen. If your offline computer is never connected to a network, are you gong to install Electrum by printing the source code and typing it into a text editor line by line?  
The glacier protocol is an interesting option  
  
The documentation discusses the threats and risks, as well as a thorough solution  
Personally, I like the Raspberry Pi Zero as an offline Bitcoin signing system. It has no networking hardware and a camera is available  
To set it up, I download the Raspbian Lite OS from the official site, use dd to copy the OS image to a micro-SD and verify the checksum of the SD  
But the standard OS does not include Electrum, the Pi camera app, ImageMagick, qrencode, zbar-tools  
So I need to expand the OS partition on the SD and copy these apps into the OS. This is where I don't have the patience to absolutely protect against malware getting from the online system to the SD. I can check the checksums of each app, and the developer signature of Electrum. It helps to build some or all the C apps from source. The Pi camera app, qrencode and zbar-tools are very small apps. ImageMagick has to be built from source to make it able to run without X-Window library dependencies  
Other issues:  
Clipboard malware  
This is reported here occasionally. It is a threat if you use the clipboard to copy/paste an address while building the unsigned transaction. This threat can be mitigated by double checking all the transaction output addresses before signing, and again before broadcasting the signed transaction. Being in a hurry makes this threat more serious

If it's so important, why are there no surveys?  
A wallet contains many addresses, dozens, or hundreds, or thousands  
An address is not a wallet, except when it is the first and only address in a wallet  
Addresses are single-use tokens, except then lazy people re-use their addresses  
Removing the bad assumptions from your question, make a new question. If Bitcoin matures to the point where address re-use disappears, how many addresses are there?  
Addresses are single-use, therefore the number of addresses is equal to the number of transaction outputs  
If you really want to know how many wallets, there is no way on the Blockchain to identify which wallet holds which addresses. Organise a survey
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:01:16


With more imagination, you could see past the subscription business model  
Instead you want to cling to an inefficient payment structure and force Bitcoin to fit into it  
If Bitcoin becomes widely adopted, subscription is a dead business model. It only exists because the old payment methods are too clumsy to handle small pay-per-use amounts  
No interruption, turn on the TV, select the movie, scan the QR into your wallet, 3 cents is a fair price, press send, watch the movie

Discussing rocks, metals and coins completely misses the point  
Schiff completely misses the point  
**Nearly all money is now digital**  
Sure, some transactions are enabled by linen banknotes and metal coins, but the currency value is completely unrelated to the fabric or metal which constitute the notes and coins  
The value of Bitcoin is described on the front page of Satoshi's white paper. Bitcoin enables a subset of transactions which are impossible using banknotes and coins because the Internet can not transmit banknotes and coins  
Before Bitcoin, Internet transactions were only possible using a small set of centralised payment gateway services. For political and commercial reasons, those services interfere with the transactions they are supposed to enable. They also monitor their customers' financial activity  
Bitcoin offers a payment option which is equivalent to using cash in the real world - free from censorship and other interference, free from surveillance  
To the extent that Bitcoin enables transactions which would otherwise be impossible, it has value  
Most people don't care about these principles because they are sheep who love to be censored and monitored. This limits Bitcoin's inherent value

I wish I could find an address with 2 known private keys

I'm fairly sure the transaction could be signed with the discovered key and the input would contain the discovered public key. This would make the signature valid. Then the public key (or corresponding redeem script) would create a hash which matches the address of the UTXO being spent

*Vouloir le beurre et l'argent du beurre*  
Bitcoin was invented as a response to fraudulent chargebacks. While you're espousing the benefits of identity proof as a disincentive to fraud in non-cash banking, there are cases where it is legal to reverse a credit card transaction, legal to steal money which belongs to the merchant  
Cash in person is the solution to chargeback fraud in the physical world. Bitcoin is analogous to cash  
What protects the consumer from merchant fraud in the physical world, when the consumer pays cash. If I pay cash to buy a TV in a shop and the TV does not work, the shop is obliged to refund my cash when I return the faulty TV. All I need for this refund is the force of State law  
If I buy my TV from a merchant in China and pay Bitcoin, then I have to rely on trust, as measured by the merchant's reputation. The State is not going to enforce my consumer rights, and there is no credit card company with consumer protection perks  
In your case, you were fooled by trust fraud, by somebody impersonating somebody you know. How does a stranger know enough about your business to be able to impersonate one of your contacts? How to guard against this type of impersonation in future? Maybe it's time to protect our communications with digital signatures. Exchange public keys with your contacts, and insist that all messages should be signed  
There is a discussion about this issue in Satoshi's White Paper. He suggests escrow as a means of preventing recipient fraud. Bitcoin supports multisig transactions. These can be used to implement escrow. The parties need to trust the escrow agent  


Decentralisation in Bitcoin is not an end in itself. It is one of the components of a system designed to be resistant to transaction censorship. Centralised bank accounts have no valid role in this context

Apparently there was, at their end  
Even so, this wouldn't matter so much if they set up their processes for instant refunds. The proper process for Bitcoin sales is to ask the customer for a refund address at checkout, and then to instantly refund to that address if any "glitch" occurs. It seems none of the payment processors follow this refund procedure, neither do most merchants.

The 2008 USA mortgage fraud was caused by market-wide dishonesty - home buyers lying about their income, mortgage brokers encouraging borrower fraud, mortgages with 2-year honeymoon rates being paid out and refinanced after 2 years, the early termination penalties for those mortgages being funded by increasing the property valuations, property valuers fraudulently overvaluing properties to enable brokers to refinance  
Then mortgages being laid off by the lenders to merchant banks in bundles, with each bundle layered in tranches, each tranche with a risk rating, B and C tranches being fraudulently rated as A due to a corrupt relationship between merchant banks and ratings agencies  
Fake revaluations every 2 years were unsustainable. In 2008, further revaluations became impossible, the house of cards collapsed  
Does this compare to the Bitcoin speculation price bubble? Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that Bitcoin is not worth more than $1.60, therefore a price of $9000 is not sustainable. No, in the sense that the Bitcoin speculation community is tiny. Only the speculators will be affected when the bubble bursts

There is a simple reason for inconsistency between wallet apps. The philosophy shared by all the developers in this space is that wallets are not portable from app to app, not even from device to device  
Developers please correct me if there are any who do not follow this philosophy  
The "seed phrase" does not belong to a user, covering all his coin assets  
There is a separate seed phrase for every app, and different seed phrases for using the same app on multiple devices  
The developer only supports recovering the wallet into the same app which created it  
To digress briefly, it is common to see in forums, advice which broadly claims that all seed phrases are portable to all wallets. Users are concerned that continued access to their coins is dependent on the wallet app software being alive in future years. They are often told that the BIP39 standard is universal and portable. This is not true. The only correct answer is that they should worry about their software becoming inaccessible in future, because nobody has a comprehensive list of which apps use which HD derivation paths  
The relevant BIP standards actually allow for different implementations. They do not require or encourage portability  
Do we want portability?  
The article seems to be settling for the current inconsistent implementation problem, supplemented with better documentation of which standards, variations and derivation paths are used in each app  
What can we do with this extra information? If all the apps are using different derivation paths, then knowing a defunct wallet's derivation path does not provide a simple recovery mechanism unless another app happens to use the same configuration  
Personally, I favour portability, and would like to see key generation and storage as a separate app. Then transaction apps can import one or more keys from the key set as required to build and sign transactions  
Also, I believe that HD was the wrong solution to the key loss problem caused by users' failure to backup. I could write 5000 words on this (maybe one day I will). In relation to this discussion, a JBoK keyset (just a bunch of keys) is simpler to externalise and make portable than the mess of derivation paths which complicates the current environment  
For light reading:  
  
  
  
No seed phrases in the Core wallet  
No portability  
Requires (only once) backup of wallet.dat  
No mechanism to recover a wallet using the xprv  
I see an elephant in the room. Wallet recovery requires rebuilding transaction history, not just recovering the key set. Users take this for granted, without realising that SPV wallets are only able to rebuild transaction history quickly by querying SPV servers and other people's full nodes. The Core wallet has to spend a few hours rescanning its Blockchain - but at least it does not have external dependencies  
The other elephant in the HD room is key gaps. This issue is often downplayed or ignored. Ignoring it is risky

This is good practice

For the OP's problem, rebuilding the chainstate databases and indexes is going to take 5 weeks on a Pi  
And ...  
Something I've noticed since more people are building a node using a fast desktop, then copying blocks and chainstate to a Pi, a lot of people are using unreliable copying methods and not checking that the blk files have been copied accurately. I would say never use rsync to copy from Windows to Linux, but a lot of people rsync without problems. I prefer to use a tar pipe over ssh, because tar has builtin CRC32 checking  
In any case, create checksums with SHA256 before copying, and then use the checksums to verify every file after copying

The economic boom in China builds new power generating stations almost monthly. Power generation infrastructure has a 30-year to 50-year lifecycle.

No, the same seed will generate exactly the same set of keys and addresses. This is why you made a backup of your wallet.dat. The backup contains the seed  
Use dumpwallet to see a list of your addresses and keys  
    bitcoin-cli dumpwallet dumpedwallet.txt
Do not expose the dumpedwallet.txt file. It contains all your private keys. Just take a look at it, and keep it safe or delete it  


That's fine, but it depends on having an up-to-date full node, and then running `rescanblockchain`. If your node's blockchain is out of date, it could take days to update  
If you're in a hurry, you can import the keys from dumpedwallet into a light wallet like Electrum, or if you just want to verify that the "missing" $35 is not missing, import the addresses into Electrum (not the keys). The correct balance will appear in less than a minute  




USB flash drives can fail  
Having multiple backups can help protect against unexpected failure of the backup medium, but only if you check them frequently, then replace any bad copies with fresh copies

It does include chainstate, which includes the UTXO database

This is a major false assumption in your question - that **all** miners stop mining when profitability falls  
Bitcoin mining is self-adjusting. When profitability falls, the least profitable miners become unprofitable and retire. The mining hash rate falls. The mining difficulty is then automatically adjusted down, in proportion to the hash rate decrease. The remaining miners remain profitable. Bitcoin keeps producing one new block every 10 minutes

The value is in the transactions which are preferable with Bitcoin, due to anonymity, or impossible without Bitcoin, such as donating to Wikileaks which is constrained by a corrupt payment embargo - Visa, Mastercard, PayPal

As well as all the other correct answers in this thread ...  
Because the Merkle root is in the block header and represents all the transactions in the block and proves their immutability  
it enables the (not yet implemented) pruning mechanism described in Section 7 of Satoshi's white paper  
To reclaim disk space, a fully spent transaction (which has no UTXOs) can be deleted from its block and replaced by its hash. If two adjacent transactions have been deleted then their hashes can be replaced by their Merkle hash. The amount of space used by a block gets smaller and smaller as more of its transactions are fully spent and then pruned. The Merkle root in the header can still be proved by hashing  
* the hashes which replace the deleted transactions, and  
* the Merkle hashes which replace the deleted pairs of transaction hashes

Not at all  
Not for known mining pools or unknown  
Every miner creates the block reward transaction for his block. This is the first transaction (TX0) in every block. To enable communication between miners and mining pool managers, there is an OP_RETURN output in every TX0. This supports 40 bytes of arbitrary data. It usually contains the pool ID, the miner's pool member ID and a random bitstring for extranonce  
When blockchain.com reports "unknown", this is only because their list of pool ID values is incomplete. It is not mandatory for pools to tell blockchain.com the pool ID values they use  
Pool ID is optional anyway, because a miner knows where to send his shares, and the pool manager knows a share is from his pool member if the miner sends his member ID correctly

There is a trivial brute force option, which does not suffer from "what the hell is a derivation path?". If the user stores one or more of the first 100 addresses, then a wallet recovery process can convert the word list to xprv, generate the xpub and test all the derivation paths. For each derivation path, derive the first 100 public keys, then hash the keys to addresses. When an address matches the one supplied by the user, the recovery process has discovered the correct derivation path  
It's not quite this simple. Some derivation paths generate separate key sets for receiving addresses vs change addresses. It should be possible to code all these cases into the brute-force loop - but would a user be required to supply a receiving address and a change address to get a proper wallet recovery?  
In a wallet recovery UX sense, is it reasonable to ask a user to supply one or two addresses as well as seed words?

The answer depends on the coin, and the honesty of the coin issuer  
Take USD Tether as the obvious example. When it was launched, it was promoted with a promise of 1:1 backing with USD fiat deposits in bank accounts. So, if there is a demand spike, there is an equal spike in USD bank deposits backing the USD Tether. Therefore, price stays stable, unaffected by demand  
Unfortunately, dishonesty means that there are more USD Tethers issued than there are USD bank deposits backing them  
Arguably, the current USDT price should be 0.74 because that is the fiat deposit ratio - but that's another issue  
Alternatively look at DAI  
It uses an external data source (oracle) to monitor the price, and automatically buys and sells on market if the price deviates from 1:1  
Again, in theory this means that a demand spike will only trigger the automatic trading mechanisms which keep the price stable, and not drive the price up  
The unknown factor in DAI is whether its automatic mechanism fails to operate outside a narrow boundary of supply and demand conditions. What if a demand spike causes the contracts to sell all the reserve DAI tokens, so that there are no more tokens to sell, therefore no mechanism to stop the price increasing if the demand spike continues  
The above analysis is not based on a deep understanding of the DAI token contracts, so it could be completely wrong

Apparently the standards are very low in the Economics school at utexas  
As for your other comments, you can indulge in professor-worship all you like. The paper is seriously flawed, and I detailed the reasons in my earlier comment. It is clear the authors have no clue how Bitcoin trading operates, so they made up a story about large exchanges trading coins, based on transaction flows observed using a questionable chain analysis technique, and on assumptions that the exchanges own the addresses exposed by chain analysis  
They appear to have started with an assumption, and proceeded to build a model which matched their assumption. Their failure to distinguish between individual speculators (exchange customers) and the exchanges' own trades pretty much destroys their entire analysis and their causality conclusions  
Now, if they take the time to uncover the truth about Tethers not backed by fiat reserves, that would be useful research. But it's not possible to discover that by building approximation models of fund flows

But they are, and assuming that it is only necessary to recover a wallet using the app which created it. This does not require documentation of derivation paths  
Then if people can't recover an old wallet from a defunct app because the developer abandoned the app, it's too late to blame the developer  
If I have a backup of my keys, and a backup of all my transactions, then all the complexity of recovering my wallet vanishes  
You shouldn't be ignoring key gaps. Some apps will not recover keys beyond the standard key gap - too hard to guess how big the key gaps are and when to stop looking for one more key
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:41:51
Neither, because the definition of "double-spend" only applies to confirmed transactions  
If you sent my node 2 transactions spending the same input, I would accept the first that arrived (TX1), then reject the other (TX2) with a message "already in mempool"  
If a different node received the transactions in the opposite order, it would accept TX2  
I propagate TX1 to my neighbours  
The other node propagates TX2 to its neighbours  
A miner's node is somewhere connected to other nodes, which are all indirectly connected to my node and the other node. Whether the miner receives TX1 or TX2 depends on the network paths connecting nodes to each other  
The miner will not receive both TX1 and TX2, will not choose between them based on fees  
Any node operator is free to change the source code of his Bitcoin node and accept both TX1 and TX2. Pre-confirmation mempool management is not part of Bitcoin consensus, so these code changes would not affect the node's ability to participate in the Bitcoin network  
But the changes would be ineffective, because all the other nodes are running the standard code and will only accept the transaction which arrives first

Why do I need a popup? That would require human intervention. My Bitcoin node runs on a free laptop, all day, every day, all by itself, never popping anything at me  
My node is connected to 40 other nodes, and they are connected to lots of other nodes. About 95,000 nodes are all connected to each other, indirectly  
When a miner has a new block to add to the Blockchain, he adds it to his own node's Blockchain, and his node sends it to all the nodes he is connected to. Those nodes send to all the nodes they are connected to. After about 43 seconds, all 95,000 nodes have the new block  
During that 43 seconds, every node checks the block against a set of validity rules. If the block is not valid, it gets rejected, and is not sent to the node's neighbors. Also, every transaction in the block is checked for validity. If any transaction is invalid, the entire block is rejected, and not propagated  
My node receives a new block, checks the block, checks all the transactions, sends the block to my 40 neighbors, automatically, all day, every day

Bitcoin is a software solution to the problem of transaction censorship. Censorship is prevented by distributing multiple copies of the transaction ledger to independent nodes. The Blockchain is a data structure designed to prevent data alteration, necessary to add trust to a mechanism which has eliminated central control  
Blockchain exists as one component in a system of multiple components, where the system's only important requirement is resistance to transaction censorship  
Blockchain arose as a solution to the data trust problem which arose from the decentralised, distributed node network  
Blockchain exists only in this context, not as a starting point to some other technology  
The trapdoor nature of cryptographic hashing protects against data alteration, Satoshi's Blockchain makes transactions unalterable, makes transaction sets unalterable in their blocks, and makes the Blockchain unalterable by using hashes to link blocks to their ancestors  
Now the IT world is full of fools who have learned the details of Bitcoin's use of hashing and the Blockchain data structure and who now believe this solution can be generalised into other areas of IT. Good luck, fools

Maybe you are right, but you are unable to consider that the majority opinion could be badly wrong, especially those "facts" which are really slogans used by the speculator parasites  
Some more ideas for you to "correct"  
Bitcoin is not an investment. It is a currency for buying and selling goods and services  
The speculation price bubble will burst, and then the price will settle to a level appropriate for its real-world use as a currency - approximately $1.60  
The price collapse will cause a massive fall in hash rate of about 99.9%  
The risk of 51% attack becomes 1000 times more likely, except that there is no profit in double-spend attacks on a $1 token  
Bitcoin's success is not dependent on a high price, or an ever-increasing price. It is successful if it can process about 300,000 transactions per day, as a currency

One correction first. Cryptography algorithms are chosen for their simplicity, because simplicity enables mathematicians to be certain an algorithm is secure. "Complex" is the wrong word. "Trapdoor" is more accurate - a calculation which is easy (requires a trivial amount of work) in one direction, and hard (requires a huge, impossible amount of work) in the other direction. "Hard" does not mean "complex"  
Bob's transaction has one or more inputs and one or more outputs. To simplify the example, let's say Bob was sent 1 Bitcoin in a transaction last week. That old transaction has an output which contains Bob's Bitcoin address and an amount of 1 Bitcoin. This transaction output is a coin. Bob owns the private key which is associated with his Bitcoin address. Bob's transaction to Steve has one input. This input contains the transaction ID and output number of the coin Bob received last week. It also contains a cryptographic signature created by Bob's private key. The transaction has one output - Steve's Bitcoin address and the amount of 1 Bitcoin. Nothing is hidden. There are no usernames, no passwords  
Bob is spending his coin (the output of last weeks' transaction) by sending the value of that coin to Steve. A coin can only be spent fully. A coin can only be spent once. Bob can never spend his coin again. Steve gets a newly created coin which he can spend in the future  
The transaction is sent to all Bitcoin nodes. In 2019, most nodes do not mine Bitcoin. The two functions became separated when mining moved from ordinary computers to specialized mining chips  
Your paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 are inaccurate, pretty much uncorrectable, so I won't try to correct them. To clarify this part of the process, see Brit Cruise's video:   
The part you're missing has been explained by some of the other comments in this thread. Transactions are not valid until they are in a mined block, verified by all Bitcoin nodes. Any validation which happens before mining is done by the nodes and miners for their own tidiness, but is **not proof** that a transaction is valid  
To explain using an apparent absurdity ...  
Nodes and miners do not need to validate any transactions before mining, because all nodes will validate transactions after mining  
But, if miners do not validate all transactions in a block, they risk the rejection of the block, so they will validate, not because they have to, but because it is in their interests to only create valid blocks

Bitcoin mining has a built-in disincentive against adding more miners - the automatic difficulty adjustment which keeps the block interval at 10 minutes  
This destroys your gold analogy  
Also, the difficulty adjustment can go down. If the price falls below the cost to mine, some miners will retire, the difficulty will fall, and the remaining miners return to profitability. This also invalidates all your "cost to mine" calculations  
As said:

Not literally  
The software states that the amount is 50 per block, and that the amount halves every 210,000 blocks. Therefore, when processing block 591751, which is more than 420000 and less than 630000, the amount must be 12.5  
The alarm would go off if the mining reward was not 12.5  
After block 630000, the alarm will go off if the reward in any block is not 6.25  
The easiest way to change the controlled supply schedule is to write a couple of lines of code which prevent the halving calculation after block 420000. Then the block reward would stay at 12.5 forever  
This would only work if there was near-unanimous agreement

Your Bitcoin stored at Coinbase is not insured against management failures similar to those which lost customers' coins at Mtgox and QuadrigaCX  
Mygox was arbitrage trading its customers' coins for its own profit. When the arbitrage trading went bad, Mtgox tried a double-up gambling strategy and lost even more, until there was nothing left  
QuadrigaCX customers' coins were well-protected in cold wallets. Passwords to access the keys for the cold wallets were known only to the CEO. He died suddenly  
Coinbase coins are insured by a very limited insurance policy. It covers theft by hackers, and is conditional on Coinbase being secure enough not to be hacked. The types of losses which occurred at Mtgox and QuadrigaCX are not insured against  
If the authorities decide you're a criminal, they can seize your assets pre-emptively, that is, with minimal justification. They can empty your bank accounts  
If you hold your own keys, the authorities can ask you to hand over your Bitcoin, if they know you have Bitcoin. You might choose to hand over some small portion of your Bitcoin, because they don't know how much you really own  
If your Bitcoin is stored at Coinbase, they can seize it all

Ignoring my other comment on price, what I am thinking of is a minimal service, no extra features storage service. No signup, no login, no passwords, no hand-holding, no browser apps, no phone apps  
I used to use this free service:   
The interface is a standard HTTP POST data transfer  
And then to charge a fee (because free is unsustainable in the long term), charge a per byte per day rate. Then, something like this:  
* user enters file size and time required  
* server calculates fee and displays payment address  
* user pays, server authorises upload  
* user uploads, server recalculates storage time based on the exact Bitcoin amount received and the exact filesize  
* server displays the file ID and the expiry time  
It is the user's responsibility to keep full records of the URL of all his files, and to remember to pay a renewal fee before the time expires. The server should provide an expiry time for any file on request - enter the file ID, see the time remaining. Renewal is then a variation on the initial payment, but initiated from the ID of the existing file  
Files not renewed on time are automatically deleted  
I would consider making encryption mandatory, to minimise the overhead of the server operator being responsible for the content of the customers' files. Again, the customers are responsible for remembering their decryption passphrases

Here are three reasons: scale, stable price, regulation ...  
Facebook's ambition for Libra is to dominate all Internet transactions  
Bitcoin will not scale to that transaction level  
Bitcoin is constrained to 1 MB per 10 minutes. This is necessary for thousands of Bitcoin nodes to synchronise independent copies of the Bitcoin Blockchain  
Libra will be centralised, so it will be free from constraints which would limit the transaction volume  
Libra will be a stable coin with fixed fiat exchange rates. Bitcoin's exchange rate suffers from irrational speculation  
Libra wants to cooperate with authoritarian regulation - transaction censorship and mass surveillance

Ask your lawyer  
The real answer to this (depending on the law where you are) is that the law requires "risk management" for detecting possible money laundering or terrorism financing  
You can implement risk management using the value of transactions and the volume of transactions. Small amounts might not require any ID verification  
ID verification increases your costs and deters customers

It's just an audit trail. IT application systems have had audit trails for decades. A blockchain is a very inefficient audit trail, requiring full traversal of the entire dataset for every query

Yes, find them on Amazon  
Example:   
The hash rate for these devices is so low that you have zero chance of ever earning mining rewards. Mining pools require miners to submit a "share" many times per second. The pool sets a difficulty target which defines a hash as a valid share. Most miners are hashing at 13-50 Thash/sec, which is thousands of times faster than a 12 Ghash/sec USB miner  
Maybe you could buy 1000 of these 12 Ghash miners

As said, merchant adoption  
Buyers won't use Bitcoin unless merchants are offering to accept it. Merchants will not implement Bitcoin unless buyers are demanding it. At some point there will be a virtuous circle of customer demand and merchant adoption. There is no sign of this happening any time soon  
Intermediate payment processors, like BitPay and Coinbase Commerce, are not instruments of adoption. They are transaction censors, like Visa and PayPal  
Currently, there are less than ten niche products and services which have adopted Bitcoin. A partial list - server hosting, VPN services, copyright piracy, various drug marketplaces - legal, cross-border, recreational  
Some of these niches have adopted Bitcoin because the merchants have been denied access to credit cards and PayPal  
There is hardly any demand from customers who want to escape the financial surveillance which comes with using credit cards  


True, as proven in the law court, that USD Tether is not backed 1:1 by USD bank deposits. The evidence is that the ratio is about 0.74  
As for the claims that the Tether backers have been manipulating the Bitcoin price, no substance, nothing but paranoia. The proponents of this aspect of the issue claim that Bitcoin price movements coincide with issuing large amounts (sometimes unbacked) of Tether. These correlations are not proof of cause. Occam's razor suggests a simpler explanation - that Bitfinex attempts to profit from volatility in the Bitcoin price and use those trading profits to try and fill the shortfall of unbacked Tether. This is a financially risky strategy, more likely to increase their losses than to patch them, a monumental example of management incompetence, but probably completely legal

Sorry to be pedantic ...  
Bitcoin consensus does not check addresses for availability of funds for spending  
The tx input actually points to one specific UTXO  
The tx input does not contain address or amount  
Then the node checks that UTXO to see if it exists and if it has not been spent  
The address and amount are retrieved from the UTXO. The address is verified as you described, and the amount is used to verify that the sum of the input amounts is not less than the sum of the output amounts

Accepting donations is the same as selling goods and services, the recipient displays a fresh Bitcoin address every time  
When I accept donations, the donor clicks a "Donate" link, I display a Bitcoin address, the donor sends the donation, or doesn't send. Either way, that address is never displayed to any donor ever again  


Bitcoin can not work on static Web pages. There must be a script or other dynamic server-side executable program to interact with the wallet, receive and display the next available address, record that address with the donor's details if required, and mark the address as used  
Note that there are no static Web pages on the Internet today. Even content which appears to be static is built from a script written in PHP or C# and publishing template tools like wordpress  
Unfortunately, if people publish their content on Facebook, YouTube, Medium and similar aggregation sites, they are dependent on the site owner to support the content creator's own Bitcoin wallet with single-use addresses

Because 51% attacks like the BTG and ETC incidents only affect exchanges. The users don't really care if one or two exchanges lose a few million overnight. The most serious outcome was one exchange refusing to list BTG  
Ultimately, exchanges can (some already do) detect tip reorgs combined with double-spends and limit their exposure by increasing confirmation requirements for large-amount transactions, and then increasing confirmation requirements dynamically (for all values) when one round of double-spends is detected. This approach would limit the loss to one round of small amount double-spends. The BTG "attack" was successful because it was allowed to run for several hours with no mitigation. The ETC incident took 3 days to steal $1 million from a couple of exchanges  
Because only exchanges are affected, and because exchanges can implement risk management to detect and mitigate an incident while it's happening, in the long run the rewards don't exist  
The small-cap SHA256 coins - I think this only means Namecoin and the two variants of BCash - are protected from attack by the lack of available hash power. This might change if many Bitcoin miners retire due to a huge Bitcoin price fall, but would still require those miners to put their hashes for hire on NiceHash or a similar marketplace. The SHA256 hash availability on NiceHash is tiny. The 2018 fall in Bitcoin hash rate did not have miners moving their hashes to NiceHash. That was a very brief fall and was followed by a massive spike as the new S15 and S17 Antminers were commissioned  
A future Bitcoin hash rate collapse could create a rental market in SHA256 hash power, but is there any reward in a 51% attack with double-spends in the small cap SHA256 coins?  
**EDIT**  
Namecoin is not what you were asking about, but for the sake of completeness, it is worth mentioning that it is merge-mined with Bitcoin

This question is often asked here, by people who have no knowledge of the Bitcoin mining automatic difficulty adjustment.

The difficulty adjustment means that only some miners retire, then the difficulty automatically goes down, then the other miners get profitable.

In 2017, a group of mining companies, exchanges and other corporations seeking profit as Bitcoin businesses decided that their financial interests were so important that they should control the Bitcoin Core node software. They believed that the 1MB block size limit needed to be doubled, because this would suit their financial goals  
They had a meeting, they published a memo - the New York Agreement. They attempted to force their block size change on the Bitcoin node network. They failed

The main reason for a 10-minute block interval is to give all the nodes enough time to reorg when there is a chain tip fork  
A one-minute block interval increases the incidence of reorgs, and reduces the time available to reorg  
At Bitcoin's transaction volume, this will stall the Blockchain. More and more nodes will spend more than a minute processing more and more reorgs. The node network will lag behind the miners. New blocks will be delayed for longer and longer  
This is not scaling. It is death  
Litecoin had a 1-minute block interval. The incidence of reorgs increased. Litecoin now has a 2.5 minute block interval

AWS is a relatively new service. Why assume they will not lose your data? They do not guarantee this  
All backup options have a risk of loss. The mechanism for eliminating this risk is to keep multiple copies in separate locations, check every copy frequently, replace bad copies with fresh copies  
Paper has the risks you describe. Laminating can help. Keeping multiple copies and checking them frequently will keep your keys safe  
DVD-R has similar risks to paper, and some other issues. Partial DVD failure caused by scratching can be mitigated by storing thousands of copies on a DVD - if the edge is scratched, the files in the middle might still be readable. Keeping multiple DVDs and checking them frequently will keep your keys safe  
HDD is a more expensive option. The same rule applies - keep multiple HDDs, check them frequently, replace bad copies with fresh copies  
Flash memory - USB flash drives, SD cards, SSD devices - have a failure mode of totally unreadable which can happen unpredictably, whether the devices are in use or stored on a shelf. If anybody wants to go this way, have at least 40 copies in 3-4 separate locations. Not recommended because the effort of checking so many copies might be a disincentive

The missing details of the story point to the most likely reason for the exchange's refusal to service - capital flight from China. Australia has a criminal intelligence sharing arrangement with China, and Chinese authorities buy press coverage 2-3 times per year claiming that there are Chinese people in Australia "laundering" Chinese money, where "laundering" covers fraud and embezzlement, and also capital flight  
Real estate transactions are less risky because real estate is less liquid. An Australian bank would be unlikely to contract a mortgage with a Chinese person who has been marked as a "launderer". For this reason most Chinese people buying Australian real estate are contracting their mortgages in third countries

The cost depends on how many bytes your transaction requires  
If it is a simple transaction with one input and two outputs, it will be about 230 bytes. You should choose a fee rate of 1 Satoshi per byte. Then your fee will be 230 Satoshis which is USD0.017  
If you send your friend $2, the fee will be the same

This is a deep rabbit hole  
Your statement is deliberately misleading, claiming that the same program requires less source code bytes. This is literally true, but is not relevant to the problems caused by excessive complexity  
In software, complexity is the enemy of reliability. Unfortunately, there are too many coders who just say "yes, it is simply a matter of programming" without caring about the unpredictable, unmeasurable future negative impact of adding more code just because you can

Your methods are different to mine, which limits my ability to help  
There are at least 5 ways to auto-start processes on reboot  
From what you've written, you appear to be using the method I avoid. Your words "auto start-up applications" and your pathname "/media/ ..." indicate you're relying on the XWindow GUI to start Core and also to mount your partition. I don't use this because the Window Manager is a heavy dependency for getting a server initialised  
Anyway ...  
At least this means you're probably running everything under your normal userid, not root  
and "path not found" means that X is not mounting /media/username/Blockchain before it starts Core  
As indicated in the earlier pararaph, I killed the X auto-mounter and I only use command-line tools for mounting partitions, some auto and some manual, so I don't know how to configure your X auto-mounter to mount the partition before it starts Core - but that appears to be the problem you need to solve (best guess)

If your technique is too clever, you will never find your seed words  
It's not secure, but can be secured with a "25th word" passphrase  
Bitcoin seed words are a tiny amount of data. Why not use JPEG steganography instead? This could be especially useful if you want to travel internationally. Hide the seed words in a JPEG using a known steganography technique. Use a photo you took yourself, stored in a directory of all your photos. Then when the border guards inspect your laptop, they see your horrible holiday photos for what they look like, not as a hiding place for Bitcoin keys  
A Bitcoin seed phrase has an option to add a "13th word" or "25th word" to 12-word or 24-word seed phrases. The extra "word" should be a 6-word or 7-word passphrase derived from the diceware protocol, or similar multi-word passphrase technique. Your Bitcoin wallet requires both the 24-word seed phrase and the passphrase (25th word) to restore your wallet  
You can store your 24 words in your notebook (or using steganography in a JPEG). Memorise the passphrase. Practice restoring your wallet using the seed phrase plus passphrase  
Your seed words are not really hidden, however clever you think your pseudo-steganography technique is, or even if you use JPEG steganography. The passphrase (25th word) makes the seeds words secure, however the seed words are stored  
Do not lose the seed phrase  
Do not forget the passphrase

The nonce is only 32 bits long (approximately 4 billion). The current generation of ASIC miners will cycle through the entire range of nonce values several times per second  
Each miner is calculating the hash of his block header. The block header is small, only has a few fields. The nonce is one of those fields, but as discussed in the previous paragraph, it runs out several times per second  
The mining pools developed a concept called "extranonce"  
This is not a new field in the header. Instead, it is data in a transaction  
The block header contains the Merkle root hash, which is calculated from the transaction hashes. Any change to any transaction will cause a change to the Merkle root hash  
The first transaction in a block is the block reward transaction. It has a financial output - the block reward payment. It also has an OP_RETURN non-financial output  
The OP_RETURN output in the block reward transaction usually contains at least 3 data fields - the mining pool ID, the miner's ID within his pool, extranonce. Any change to any of these fields will change the hash of the transaction, which causes the Merkle root hash in the header to change  
Even if every miner has the same transactions (in the same order), every pool has a different pool ID, so there is no work duplication between pools  
Every miner has a different miner ID, so there is no work duplication between miners  
The miner uses a random number for the extranonce, and changes the extranonce every time the nonce values run out  


The process of all miners using a random number for the extranonce means no coordination is needed  
There is some latency recalculating the Merkle root hash every time the extranonce is changed. This is unavoidable, because the small size of the nonce makes the extranonce necessary  
More:  
In some pools, the miners are able to select some of the transactions for their blocks. Every miner who does this will have a different Merkle root hash  
In future, as BetterHash is implemented, miners will be able to select all the transactions for their blocks. The pool's job then becomes simpler - tracking miners' shares and distributing the block rewards

Mismanagement at the exchange can cause the exchange to have insufficient coins to satisfy withdrawal requests. This happened to Mtgox and QuadrigaCX, and could easily happen to Coinbase


Read the story about the "Bitcoin expert" who bought a Trezor. He left the seed words on paper on his daughter's pillow, then went on vacation. After returning from vacation, he couldn't remember the Trezor's PIN, and the seed words had been trashed by the cleaner. His Bitcoin was rescued by exploiting a vulnerability on the Trezor. This bug has since been fixed  
  


Some people get confused, panic, then delete  
For example, it is common for new users to be confused about change outputs, "I had 0.1 BTC, spent 0.005 BTC, and the address which had the 0.1 BTC is now zero. What happened to the other 0.095?"  
At this point, most people ask for help, find the change output and the problem is solved  
Some people have a knee-jerk response to any computer "problem" - delete and reinstall. Deleting a Bitcoin wallet means the coins are lost - unless there is a backup of the seed words, the wallet, or the private keys  


What Americans call "SIM porting". For convenience, you can keep your phone number when you change phone providers. This also means that thieves can pretend to be you, then port your phone number to their phone SIM. If your phone number protects your Web email account or your Bitcoin exchange account, the thief can then steal your Bitcoin (as well as the money in your bank account)  
  


The common advice these days is that a user does not need to backup a wallet, because any wallet can be restored from a seed phrase. Some wallets support importing extra keys - from paper wallets, BATM tickets, etc. If a wallet is restored from a seed phrase the imported keys are lost  


Paper wallets can fade, be eaten by insects or other vermin, damaged by water, fungus, acid in the paper  
Backups on USB thumb drives can become totally unreadable while stored - backups on any media can fail, but Flash memory has a bad failure mode - unpredictable totally unreadable - and many people think it is 100% reliable

Yes, the same technique used by BIP39 is possible  
Any private key, public key, address, or other arbitrary integer can be converted to a mnemonic  
The address or xpub will be encoded as Bitcoin base58, or bech32, or hexadecimal. Convert the base58 string, bech32 string or hexadecimal string into a bitstring  
Split the bit string into groups of 11-bits. An 11-bit bitstring is an integer from 0-2047. An integer from 0-2047 is an index into an array containing 2048 words  
Using this word list:   
Each 11-bit bitstring converts to a mnemonic word like this example ...  
The bitstring 11110101000 is the integer 1960  
    dc -e '2i 11110101000 p'  
    1960  
Array index 1960 coincides with "vital" in the word list  
    word_array=($(cat bip39.wordlist.txt))  
    echo ${word_array[1960]}  
    vital  
This description covers part of BIP39 - the part that turns an arbitrary bitstring into mnemonic words selected from a list of 2048  
The rest of BIP39 hashes the words (plus the extra word, if supplied) using SHA2-512 2048 times to produce the xprv. This part is not relevant to the question

Create a script which evaluates to false  
Hash the script to an address using SHA256 followed by RIPE160  
Follow steps 4-9 from   
except that the prefix for pay-to-script-hash is x'05' not x'00'  
To prove the address is a burn address, reveal the original script to the other person and tell them to hash the script to an address. The address will match your burn address  
  
Understand the paragraph which begins with this:  


The 1Counterparty and similar addresses created here:  
  
using programs like this:  
  
These work by:  
*    start with some text (valid base58)  
*    insert a '1' prefix, fill the rest of the address with an arbitrary character  
*    decode from base58 to binary (21 bytes)  
*    double-sha256 to find the checksum  
*    append checksum  
*    convert back to base58  
There is no private key because you skipped steps 0-4 from   
You can not prove there is no private key  
but the pattern of 1MyBurnTextxxxxxx is *very unlikely* to be derived from private/public key pair

Paradoxically, every hash added to the global rate reduces the Bitcoin value of every hash. The hash rate can only increase if miners' fiat-value reward increases, or if miners' fiat cost per hash decreases  
The increase from 40 EHash to 100 EHash was driven mainly by the relative efficiency (in hashes per Joule) of the Antminer S17 compared to its predecessor the Antminer S9, helped by the price increase from USD3300 to USD9500 at the same time

As another comment mentioned, the miner does verify the transactions, but only because an invalid block would be rejected by the nodes  
The miner is paid for winning the hashing race, not for verifying the transactions in his block

Bitcoin fees used to be optional  
Then there was a spam flood of zero-fee transactions, so the community adopted a minimum transaction fee of 1 Satoshi per byte to deter the negative effect of transaction spamming. These fees go to miners, but their purpose is to protect the system from congestion  
Today, you can always submit a transaction with the minimum fee. Occasionally, the number of transactions being created exceeds the capacity of the system, and thousands of transactions have to wait in a queue. After a few hours (sometimes a few days), the backlog clears and life goes back to normal. People who are not in a hurry can simply wait. People with urgent transactions can pay extra fees for their transactions to be moved to the front of the queue  
Why does the fee go to the miner? In my opinion this was a mistake. But then, where to send the fee if not to the miner? The system could have been designed to send the fees to any transaction participants, but this would have made the transaction payment mechanism much more complicated. So the miner gets paid. This might be bad but at least it's simple

Not sure how this would work in practice, how can Satoshi-pruned nodes and unpruned nodes signal each other what type of blocks they're offering to share

Nothing to do with double spending  
The payment processor has a risk of receiving $1000 worth of Bitcoin for a hotel booking, and an exchange rate fall might reduce that Bitcoin to $900 during the payment process. The processor still has to send $1000 of fiat to the merchant. Limited time to pay reduces (does not prevent) this risk. 15 minutes is unreasonably short, but I guess they were advised by expert actuaries  


23 days for me, but the payment was to buy DOGE. The amount of DOGE was adjusted to the exchange rate at the time of confirmation, no fiat anywhere

Complicated, but the important answer was already given by The block header is always exactly 80 bytes  
Thirty-two of those 80 bytes contain the Merkle root hash. It takes time to calculate this, and the time varies according to the number of levels in the tree (the base2 logarithm of the number of transactions), because a Merkle tree has 2 nodes at each level  
The complication is that the Merkle hash can be pre-calculated before starting to mine a block, and if the transaction list changes during mining, the Merkle hash can be pre-calculated before changing the block header. If the Merkle calculation is done by a non-mining computer, and if it is done without delaying the mining hashes, then it has no effect on the hash rate  
More complication, not so important: the Merkle hashes are a binary tree, so only some of the tree nodes need to be recalculated if the miner is only changing one transaction  
For example, it is common to change extranonce by modifying a random bitstring in an OP_RETURN output in TX0. Because TX0 is the first transaction, the only Merkle nodes which change are the set of nodes up the left side of the tree, one recalculation for each tree level

Is this a reasonable script? ...  
Kleiman family reads rumours of a hoard of coins. Due to Bitcoin's explosive speculation boom, a million Bitcoin is now "worth" billions of USD, compared to maybe USD5000 when it was mined (using pizza day exchange rate)  
Kleiman family would be foolish to ignore the opportunity of a multi-billion windfall. Lawyers' picnic ensues  
Wright has lost the keys to any coins from those days, because they were only ever worth pennies. Nearly every early dabbler in Bitcoin got bored with it and abandoned their worthless coins. Wright was no exception  
A lawsuit arrives, claiming rights to hoarded coins, which Wright knows are lost coins. What are Wright's options:  
*    ignore the lawsuit because the claim is ridiculous  
*    write a quick refutation letter explaining that the claim is ridiculous  
*    let the USA Justice System grind its wheels and see if the players are foolish enough to make a judgment which affirms the Kleiman family belief that the coins exist  
The latter option somehow becomes reality. Wright fabricates evidence that the Tulip Trust is real, arbitrarily chooses a list of high-value Bitcoin addresses to embellish the evidence. Wright embellishes further with a story about a multi-key escrow which matures when a courier delivers a sealed letter on New Year's Day 2020

The analysis presented in this paper falls a long way short of proof. The paper makes no distinction between exchanges trading on their own account, and the trading activity of exchange customers  
It would be reasonable to assume that most trading activity is conducted by the exchanges' customers - individual speculators trading for their own profit  
The alleged price manipulation relies on the opposite assumption, that the exchanges are trading on their own account, and that activity includes printing USD Tether in order to buy Bitcoin to manipulate the Bitcoin price upwards  
The trading flow analysis shows that Bitcoin price falls are followed by higher demand for Bitcoin (commonly discussed in this subreddit as "buying the dip"). The fact that Tether is used to buy Bitcoin during these dips is a simple consequence of the fact that USD Tether is a proxy for USD on those exchanges which do not want to be burdened with the overheads of holding USD fiat balances in their customers' accounts. The Tether flows observed by the paper's authors are nothing more than normal Bitcoin speculation purchases  
Bitfinex is the main source of Tether, so there is nothing special in observing Tether moving from Bitfinex to other exchanges during periods of heavy trading. It shows that many speculators hate using Bitfinex for trading, so they buy Tether on Bitfinex and then move it to their preferred exchange for trading cryptocurrencies  
Tether is controversial, because the claim that it is 100% backed by fiat reserves is unproven. Unfortunately, this paper fails to add anything to the controversy, completely fails to prove any price manipulation by the Tether issuer or Bitfinex

You're missing the optimistic delusion in the Bitcoin speculator's reasoning - if the supply falls, scarcity makes the price double, mining profitability stays the same, hash rate doesn't fall  
The reason this is a delusion is that it falsely assumes mining is the only source of liquidity  
I'll also challenge your logic "the decrease in hash decreases the security and hence demand". Mining does not secure Bitcoin. Non-mining nodes secure Bitcoin. The hash rate can be anything, as long as there are sufficient miners and sufficient nodes  
As for price, there is no logic. Both coins are in an irrational speculator bubble. Prices are not correlated to supply, demand, hash rate or anything tangible. They are driven entirely by psychology

You're still confused about Bitcoin as a payment method. I bought $50 worth of Bitcoin this morning, then I bought $50 worth of network services a few hours later. Bitcoin increased from 8000 to 8200 during that period. I will not pay tax on a  $1.25 gain. There is no taxation authority anywhere in the world that could possibly administer 90 million transactions per year for a few cents of capital gain or loss  
Get a wallet, get some Bitcoin, spend it. Stop parroting all the bullshit objections you've been fed in your client's "list of bad things about Bitcoin"  
What do we have so far?  
*    Bitcoin does not prevent users entering the wrong address  
*    Bitcoin has a very small possibility of discovering some other user's private key  
*    The mining reward halving will cause the mining hash rate to fall and create a risk of 51% attack  
*    Any price fall will cause the mining hash rate to fall and create a risk of 51% attack  
*    Capital gains tax is payable on every transaction  
*    Nobody uses it for buying things

No need for a mathematical proof of a computing axiom. This is simply how computers work  
What's missing in this discussion is any mathematical proof, or any other proof, that any of your proposed algorithms have a "can not be made into ASIC" property  
History has already proved that several supposedly ASIC-proof algorithms were nothing more than a clever idea, based on assumptions about ASICs. Those assumptions were proven false by the subsequent development and production of the ASICs  
Scrypt is ASIC-proof because its memory requirement exceeds the amount of memory addressable by an ASIC  
Bitmain installs memory on Scrypt ASIC, destroying foolish assumption

For a small volume of transactions, there should be a trivial way to set this up, from a comment yesterday:  
  
* store a list of unused addresses  
* choose the next unused address at checkout  
* display the address to the customer  
* remove the address from the unused addresses list  
* store the address with the order so you know which order has been paid when each payment arrives in your wallet

If you treat Bitcoin as a cash analogy, then the delays in the purchase process can be minimised, "send 0.12345 Bitcoin within 2 hours, item will be dispatched when payment has 2 confirmations"  
Price fluctuation risks are minimized by the purchaser acquiring the Bitcoin at the time of the purchase, the merchant imposing a time limit, and then the merchant selling the Bitcoin immediately on receipt  
Your purchase delay is rare, so the conditions should probably be renegotiated  
IMO, the general principle would be that if you purchased the correct amount of Bitcoin last week, expecting to pay that amount, then the original amount should stand. The merchant benefits from the price rise. Conversely, if the price falls, the merchant suffers from the price fall  
If you've held Bitcoin for a week and it's now worth 20% more, then you could tell the merchant you've decided to cancel the purchase. Then make a new purchase, for a 20% lower amount, and keep the profit. You can justify this because of the delay. If not for the delay, you would have sent the Bitcoin last week, and the merchant would have sold the Bitcoin for fiat on the same day - neither buyer nor merchant profits from the price fluctuation  
This is a common issue on P2P exchanges. If a price rise happens mid-transaction, then the seller sometimes cancels the trade, and vice versa, if the price falls, the buyer sometimes cancels the trade

Investors? That's stretching things, but let's go banking anyway  
Mtgox was holding depositors' funds in trust. This means the value of the coins in the Mtgox wallets belongs to the depositors, the Mtgox customers, in the same way as your bank deposits are not assets of your bank, not part of your bank's shareholders' equity  
The Mtgox business was simple. Accept fiat deposits, accept Bitcoin deposits, exchange Bitcoin with fiat in both directions, allow customers to withdraw fiat and Bitcoin  
Mtgox had an obligation to always have reserves equal to deposits, to be able to service all customers requesting 100% withdrawal of their fiat balances and Bitcoin balances at any time  
Bad things happened, Mtgox could not satisfy customer withdrawal requests, the company chose the bankruptcy process, and 5 years later things have moved forward, with the bizarre and lucky intervention of an irrational speculator price bubble boosting the "value" of the coins  


In a bankruptcy, the parties are creditors and shareholders. The process is to pay the creditors, and if the creditors' claims are satisfied 100%, distribute the remaining value to the shareholders  
**Mtgox had no assets. There is nothing to distribute to the shareholders**  
The remaining coins belong to the depositors. I don't even need to argue this. The Trustee did not choose civil rehabilitation. The creditors sued for the bankruptcy to transition to civil rehabilitation, and the Judge agreed with them. The Trustee is following the order of the Court  




The obvious answer is the simple one. The depositors are the only party with a valid claim

Good enhancements are inconvenient because the blockchain infrastructure - decentralised node network - is difficult to propagate software updates into  
Extension blocks are a clumsy workaround, a way to add features without invalidating the software on nodes which fail to update  
Unnecessary complexity should be avoided in any software  
Ultimately, the update problem needs an elegant solution  
If not, new coins, new blockchains will be launched with great, new features like confidential transactions, and the old, increasingly software-bloated coins will be consigned to the graveyard of obsolescence

I don't know any way to reliably kill the Wifi in an old phone, or the cell radio. Isn't everything on a single chip?  
You might think you can prevent connection to the cell network just by having no SIM. Your thief will just insert a SIM. Also, a phone with no SIM can still connect to a cell  
Otherwise, your analysis is accurate, except that Bither is a pile of rodent droppings. Electrum would be better, using the protocols described:   
but using QR for communication, not "a USB stick"  
Raspberry Pi Zero would be a better solution, comes with no network  
**The bootstrap problem**  
The part none of the "cold wallet" discussions cover is how to get all the software components installed. If you use a Pi Zero, you need to start with a fresh Raspbian OS and add Electrum, qrencode, zbarimg, ImageMagick  
This is not particularly difficult, except that every time you reboot your device and try to use it for a Bitcoin transaction, you discover you need that one extra app  
How do you test that every app is uncorrupted? For example, Electrum is signed by the developer. Does your old phone come with GnuPG built-in? Raspbian does. Even then, you have no network, so how are you going to import the developer's public key?

Depends on the contract  
Genesis is the biggest in this field  
Their contract requires a once-only fee for a specific hash rate for an unspecified time, and monthly maintenance payments  
The hash rate lets you approximate your future earnings  
Divide monthly earnings into the once-only fee to find your break-even date  
Usually this date is about 2-3 years  
The Genesis contract has a clause allowing them to determine that your contract is no longer profitable and then cancel it - see "unspecified time" above  
This usually happens before your break-even date  
Bitdeer has fairer contracts. Their once-only payment is for a specified time. Calculate the break-even date on their contracts. The biggest contracts are marginally profitable. Everybody else is just baggage, hobby miners losing money for fun  
Bitdeer only accepts payments in cryptocurrency  
Importantly, note that even the profitable contracts turn into big losses if the Bitcoin price falls during the life of the contract

Bitcoin works OK on cell phones, but the cell phone platforms have built-in payment platforms. You have to have a Google Play store account or an Apple App store account. Google and Apple extra 30% fees from all payments, but nobody cares enough to break out of these closed platforms and closed payment systems  
Bitcoin is an obvious alternative to avoid donating 30% of every payment to the giant corporations. Apple's platform is so tightly closed that users have no option. Most Android devices have a simple opt-out switch to install apps from "external sources", but most people are frightened to venture outside the official store

The judge is saying that Wright's uncooperative behaviour and dishonesty is a form of contempt which allows for an arbitrary judgment against him, regardless of whether there are actually any coins  
The Judge's belief is not relevant. He's really saying he doesn't care whether the coins exist  
In a sense it is a lazy judgment. The Judge can not determine all the facts relating to the issue at trial. He believes Wright's behaviour is the reason for being unable to determine whether the coins exist. He chooses to end the trial by punishing Wright's behaviour  
If there are no coins - or other things of value such as intellectual property - then the effect is the same, 50% of nothing is nothing

As already said, you have to download the entire Blockchain even if you prune. Every node has to build a database of unspent coins. The fact that the transaction is missing from the pruned blocks files is not important, because the transaction was processed during node initialisation, and its outputs were added to the unspent coins database  
The main disadvantages of a pruned node are:  
*    it can not serve blocks to new nodes to help initialise them  
*    if you import an old key (or address) to your Core wallet, you can not scan your copy of the Blockchain to find any transactions relating to the address

Can you please publish a transcript of the podcast. Without text, you haven't actually published anything at all  
It won't happen  
The discussion is a good counterpoint against the foolish "can we make the blocks bigger now maybe?" posts which occasionally pollute this subreddit  
This justification is misleading - "the total cost to sync a new node for the first time is growing significantly faster than technology improvements to reduce such costs"  
The justification is true, but reducing block size now will not fix this specific problem  
Node initialisation is extremely slow because of the way it processes every transaction to build the UTXO database. Starting from block 0, every output of every transaction is added to the UTXO database. Then, every transaction input causes one UTXO (the output being spent) to be deleted from the UTXO database  
This process does not go faster by reducing the block size  
Building the UTXO database would be faster by removing process steps which cancel out. During node initialisation, it is wasteful to add an output to the UTXO database, and then delete it later  
A fast method for building the UTXO database:  
Sort all transaction outputs by txID+output_number  
Sort all transaction inputs by txID+output_number of the output being spent by this input  
Merge-match these two sorted lists. Discard all the outputs which have a matching input. Bulk load the remaining outputs into the UTXO database  
Estimated processing time: 30 minutes

Most operators charge fees by boosting the buy price  
So what you should do is take a phone and use it to look up the current price according to Google or cryptocompare or your favourite price quoting service  
Then look at the price on the machine  
Your phone has a calculator. Divide the machine price by the Google price and see the markup  
Example,  
*    Google says 1 Bitcoin equals 3,782.00 United States Dollar  
*    ATM says current price is 4,159.54  
*    4159.54 / 3782.00  = 1.0998  
*    This is a 10% fee  
Carefully read the screen to see if there are extra fees  
After you insert the first currency bill, the machine will tell you the Bitcoin value of that $20. Divide the USD by the Bitcoin amount on the screen to check the rate you're actually getting. If you're unhappy about the rate, cancel and get the machine to refund your $20  
Example  
*    you inserted one $20 bill and the Bitcoin amount displayed is 0.00462975  
*    20 / 0.00462975 = 4319.89  
*    4319.89 / 3782.00 = 1.14  
*    the fee is 14%, not 10%  
*    is this too high? You drove all this way

It is not easily verifiable  
If you have 2 blockchains, both hash-verifiable as correct, there has to be an automatic software mechanism to choose one and reject the other  
Even without malice and fraud, occasionally 2 blocks are mined at the same time, propagated to different segments of the node network. Proof of work supports a software decision which enables a node to discard the invalid block one or two (or more) blocks later, discard the invalid descendant blocks, and reorganise the node's chain tip by asking neighbour nodes to send replacement blocks from the correct chain  
Your "random choice" suggestion does not have any way to resolve this situation. I suggest it is not even possible unless there is a central controller making the random choice. Perhaps you are not aware of the need for Bitcoin nodes and mining to be decentralised

There is no chain of addresses  
This is a myth perpetrated by those over-simple diagrams which explain Bitcoin for beginners  
Bitcoin has only one link - from a transaction input back to the output it is spending  
The outputs of a transaction are not actually linked to the inputs of the same transaction. Analysis tools which assume that a transaction's all inputs and all-but-one outputs belong to the same person - the transaction sender - are guessing that this relationship is true, when it often is not true  
Try this  
Look for a well-known casino Bitcoin address. Look at a recent transaction with at least 20 inputs. Track those inputs back through all possible paths, as many steps as you can go until you find your casino address. Then track from the casino address forward to all possible coins which are tainted by that casino transaction

Correct  
But the effect is worse than this  
Bitcoin's network is designed to make Bitcoin uncensorable. An authoritarian regulator or corporation can not control which transactions are permitted because there is no central point of control  
The same applies to Bitcoin software development. If all the identifiable Bitcoin developers were served with court orders to subject the software to authoritarian control, they can abandon Bitcoin. Bitcoin development can continue with other developers

Yes  
They will just change the method of transferring value in their existing internal payment methods - gift cards and Amazon Pay  
Instead of relying on password logins and single-use insecure tokens, they will copy Bitcoin and use asymmetric cryptography to sign payments  
This will improve security and almost eliminate liability risk due to hacking  
It will be centralised  
They will never adopt Bitcoin  
Eventually, all online transactions will go this way. The potential future liability cost of exposed credit card details will make the current payment systems obsolete. Secure, centralised, not Bitcoin  
Amazon gift cards could become a great method for buying Bitcoin without loss. If they can be designed to prevent double-spending, then they can be safely traded at 1:1 face value

It does not. The block reward is the same 12.5 Bitcoin for every block. The distribution of the reward by mining pools is not part of the design of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin mining is a losing proposition because the margins are wafer-thin, and then profitability switches to negative as the difficulty increases  
Mining difficulty is calculated automatically, to keep the block interval at 10 minutes  
This automatic calculation means that the profit per miner decreases in proportion every time a new miner is added to Bitcoin  
Your friend's investment might show a wafer-thin profit initially - a promise of payback within about 20 months - and then will shift to loss-making after about 2-4 months,  
so it can never pay back the initial investment

Import the unsigned transaction to the offline computer, by pointing a camera at the QR code, and using a QR decoder like zbarimg to decode it  
Sign the transaction on the offline computer  
Use qrencode to make a QR image of the signed transaction  
Display the QR on the offline computer, point a camera at the QR to export the signed transaction to the online computer, then broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network
The private keys are never exposed to the network  
Proper instructions here:  
  
except that where the instructions say "transfer the transaction file to your offline machine (e.g. with a usb stick)", you can make a QR image and transfer it using a camera

Gift cards are fixed value, so they create a problem for consumers who have to deal with the inconvenience of partial card balances  
Amazon could remove inconvenience from their gift cards  
Instantly create a single gift card for the exact sale amount at checkout,  
and then buy the gift card for cash at the local store  
Then they could operate the gift card system as a centralized cryptocurrency,  
just like Bitcoin, but with a single node maintaining the blockchain  
Then make Amazon gift cards fully liquid,  
so that they can be used by other merchants  
with no fees to redeem them  
and the right to consolidate, split and re-sell  
Then they are just as useful as Bitcoin,  
except centralised and censored

Merchants should never hold Bitcoin. They should sell Bitcoin for fiat as often as necessary to avoid the risks of price fluctuation. If sales for Bitcoin are equivalent to only a few hundred dollars per day, then converting Bitcoin to cash once per day is sufficient to avoid exchange price fluctuation risk. High value sales might require converting every Bitcoin amount as soon as it is received

Size isn't everything. If the randomness is imperfect, the size of the random part of a key can be reduced so far that a few minutes of brute force can find any key. See Netscape Navigator SSL keys from 1995:  
  
This generated a 128-bit encryption key using several components. Unfortunately, so many of the components had predictable values that the actual randomness was only about 47 bits

This is a really bad idea  
This is one of the reasons "open source" is a weasel phrase. People can appropriate it to mean anything they want, because the freedom mandated by a free licence like the GPL is inconvenient for some people  
Free software (free as in freedom, not free beer) can be modified freely, with the restriction that the modified version is also free  
Read the history  
A group of system administrators at a prestigious university were used to having access to all the source code for their systems, wanted to modify printer drivers and print queue management because they needed more flexible control of print queues. The printer manufacturer refused to release the source code  
Out of this disagreement, the Free Software Foundation was born  
The point of this history lesson is that it is more important to be permitted to modify software than it is to just be allowed to read the code  
For an example of what you're asking for, look at Bernstein's licence for qmail, and ask "Who uses qmail any more?"  


This is complete rubbish

Partial economy of scale  
The Bitcoin software makes the hashing problem proportionally more difficult as more hashing power is added  
because the main purpose of mining is to regulate the interval between new blocks to 10 minutes  
This means that every additional unit of hashing power reduces the profitability of all hashing power proportionally  
An economy of scale where only large mining facilities are profitable, and where the underlying algorithms keep the profit margins very small, probably negative for much of the time

Your post shows a flawed understanding of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, no person ever discloses their keys. Instead, they transfer value by spending a coin and signing the transaction with a key  
A Will might reveal keys an an executor, but the executor should do only one thing with the keys - immediately transfer all the value to a new key (or keys)  
Lost keys can not be passed to another person anyway. A lost key is lost forever, can not be reconstructed from fragments or using any clever mathematics  
Losing a key is not a problem if the coin has already been spent. Bitcoin value is lost only if a coin can not be spent. Coin expiry (maybe after 100 years) could allow the value of unspendable coins to be recirculated  
Coin expiry could be simple  
Change consensus rules to allow unsigned transactions  
*    if the coin being spent is more than 5.25 million blocks (100 years) old, **and**  
*    if the transaction has zero outputs  
A transaction with zero outputs will send all of its inputs to miner fees. The expired coin's value returns to circulation as part of the mining reward  
The Bitcoin "community" believes unspendable coins should remain unspendable because it makes the rest of the coins more valuable, a selfish view

Coins (also called UTXO), not public keys, not addresses  
has answered your question  
Coin selection is a multi-faceted trade-off. The lazy way is to pick the largest value coins until there is sufficient value for the payment. After a few payments, this creates a collection of small value change coins. Eventually, a payment has to be made from a large number of small value coins, making a large (in bytes) transaction with proportionally large fees. Clever coin selection will take account of the current fee market, and the user's nominated tolerance for confirmation delay  
Electrum can automatically choose coins, or the user can view the coin list and choose which coins to include. Some user-choice strategies are too complex to be coded in software. For example, I will often add one or two low value coins to a transaction when they're not strictly necessary. The benefit is that the transaction serves two purposes - spending, and partial consolidation of low-value coins into a high value change coin. Sometimes, if fees are high, I will not do this. Other times, if I'm not in a hurry, I will deliberately choose low fees and wait 12 hours for confirmation. Other times I will put all my coins into a transaction, consolidating everything into a single change output. These strategies have privacy implications, see below  
Another issue is privacy, resistance to spy-tracking. Recently has published some articles about privacy and transaction tracking. The privacy implications of various strategies for coin selection and change coins are enlightening

That's how Bitcoin works, address re-use is bad  
Anyway, it makes no difference if the addresses are different or the same

The design discussed in the article does actually miss the fundamental aspect of the design of Bitcoin consensus. It falsely describes consensus as determined by mining. In fact mining only provides one component of consensus - a block header which hashes to a value in a pre-specified range of values (target)  
Consensus is properly understood in terms of the "don't trust, verify" slogan. Every node checks the block consensus rules against every new block, and the transaction consensus rules against every transaction in a new block  
The "scientists" are claiming that trust can be assigned to nodes, and transaction validation can be performed using probability heuristics - if some combination of nodes can be assumed not to be conspiring to corrupt the Blockchain, then security can be proved by checking a sufficient number of nodes  
The obvious flaw is that the proposed method moves trust from "my node told me the transactions were good" to "my node contacted sufficient other nodes"  
Very similar to the IOTA trust network, which in practice is very centralized  
More on Bitcoin:  
The consequence of the principle of "don't trust, verify" is that a network of thousands (or millions) of nodes has to verify, then propagate a new block before the next block arrives. Also, occasionally, two miners discover different valid hashes at the same time. Some nodes will have one block and others will have the other. The consensus mechanism detects that a chain tip reorganisation is required to resolve the fork - automatically. To ensure sufficient time for propagation, and for occasional tip reorgs, there is a 10-minute (average) delay between blocks. Mining creates this delay  
The mechanism proposed in the article does not handle reorgs. It has the same flaw as the IOTA consensus system. There is no way to guarantee a canonical ordering of transactions, no way to prevent two different groups of nodes confirming two different valid answers to "verify the order of these transactions"  
Bitcoin's reorg method - which fork is valid - is a simple calculation comparing the work expended on each chain tip. More work means longer chain, which means this is the valid chain  
This calculation requires that the work is done

Expensive too. It's difficult to justify paying for a big microSD when you're boasting about using a super-cheap $35 Pi  


Node initialisation usually fails if it is writing to a USB-connected HDD. This is why people prefer to use a single-board computer with a SATA port, one of the Odroid models for example  
Otherwise, most people initialise on a PC, then transfer the data directory to the Pi's external HDD  
Another possible option:  
It is now easy to specify a separate disk for storing the block files. Because these are low I/O, it could be viable to write the block files to an external HDD, and keep the index files and database files on a 16GB microSD, at least during initialisation  
It will still take weeks to initialise a new node on a Pi. A few months ago, someone posted a node initialisation time of 5 weeks for a Pi3, using microSD only and pruning - a pruned node will fit on a 16GB microSD on a Pi3  
The Pi4 CPU is supposed to be about 2.2x as fast as the Pi3, so maybe it will take "only" 16 days to initialise a Pi4 node

It just works, a self-sustaining network of software and nodes and users, with occasional careful tweaks to the software  
This week:  
Blocks filled up, confirmation times increased, fees increased  
started squealing "it's broken, someone fix it quick", "protect us from this attack", "the devs should ..."  
It's not broken  
Quick fixes are unwise  
Unexpected consequences will cause real damage  
Incremental improvements will continue  
As SegWit adoption increases, and then Schnorr signatures improve block efficiency a bit more, Bitcoin gets to about 10 transactions per second  
The false dichotomy:  
* Ignorant people want larger blocks, but refuse to acknowledge their negative effect on the node network  
* Technological determinists want to overlay Bitcoin with side-chains, but refuse to acknowledge that side-chains violate Bitcoin's trust principle because each side-chain is centrally controlled  
The One True Bitcoin worship  
and the common use of disparaging terms like altcoin and shitcoin  
prevents the discussion of a multi-coin cryptocurrency ecosystem as a possible answer to the scaling question  
This is not important, because nobody needs to do anything to implement this scaling solution, it will occur naturally ...  
Bitcoin is limited to approximately 10 transactions per second  
When demand reaches 10 transactions per second, Bitcoin blocks fill, fees increase, users look for alternatives  
A different coin becomes popular, soaks up the excess demand, and together both coins share the demand until both coins have full blocks  
Another different coin becomes popular, soaks up the excess demand ... repeat indefinitely

Apologies, I exaggerate  
Bitcoin does not need perfection,  
since perfection is not reality anywhere  
One or 2 perfectionists in a group is a good balancing influence  
Bitcoin needs near-perfection in at least 2 places  
* block propagation must always have a safe buffer to complete before the next block is mined  
* immutability of the Blockchain requires zero errors in the recording of transactions and blocks - it is never feasible to retrospectively repair errors

Confirmed after 13 hours  
Giant transaction has dozens of inputs  
Maybe learn to manage your incoming more carefully,  
and stop reusing addresses so that you can consolidate coins a few at a time instead of dozens in one transaction  
Or maybe none of that matters ...  
79 Sat/byte fee for a 1.6 Bitcoin tx and 13 hour confirmation time  
A good result  
The other 2 transactions should be rejected as double-spends if they ever get near a block, assuming at least one input from each one is duplicated in the successful transaction - hard to tell for sure

Try the suggestion about using BIP39 as a passphrase generator  
  
Diceware is a similar technique using a word list  
  
  
There are two steps:  
*    generate entropy  
*    convert entropy to a list of words  
How much entropy? There is a consensus opinion that 80 bits is enough. A very thorough analysis is available here:   
Eighty bits is probably enough, but you can read the reasons for using more  
How to generate entropy? If you have a good operating system, it will have a built-in entropy generator. Recent Linux versions have good entropy in /dev/random. Is it good enough? You can spend hours reading discussions about that  
Coin toss:   
That article was written for generating a single Bitcoin key. The same process can be used to generate entropy for any purpose. If you want 80 bits of entropy, toss the coin 80 times  
Dice toss: see Diceware  
How many bits in a coin toss, dice throw, etc  
A coin toss has one bit of entropy  
Using the Diceware method of throwing a 6-sided die 5 times gives a range of values from 11111 to 66666. This is equivalent to 00000 to 55555 in base 6. 55555 base 6 equals 7775. This is why the Diceware word lists have 7776 words. How much entropy in the integer range 0-7775? The base2 log of 7776 is about 12.9  
How to convert entropy to words?  
The Diceware method is a simple lookup. The result of 5 dice tosses indexes a single word in the list  
The BIP39 method splits the entropy into groups of 11 bits to look up using a list of 2048 words. The BIP39 page - download and use offline - uses a javascript function to generate entropy. If this is not random enough, you can generate entropy from /dev/random or coin tosses or dice throws and enter your entropy into the BIP39 form. Do **NOT** use brain entropy, words from your head, keyboard mashing and similar  
I currently use this 2-line shell command script to generate a 7-word Diceware passphrase from 88 bits of /dev/random  
    effwordy=($(cut -f 2 eff_large_wordlist.txt))  
    for ndx in $(dc -e "16i6o$(head -c 11 /dev/random|xxd -p -u)p"|fold -w 5|head -7);do echo ${effwordy[+$((6  
The first line puts the EFF Diceword list into an array  
The second line gets 88 bits from /dev/random, converts to hexadecimal, then converts to base 6, splits the base-6 number into 5-digit chunks, discards the 8th chunk because it's short, then looks up the word array 7 times

The main purpose of proof of work is to insert a delay between the blocks  
The delay allows the previous block to propagate to all the nodes  
The delay also allows nodes to reorganise the tips of their Blockchains when an occasional "orphan branch" appears in part of the network  
"51%" refers to someone controlling enough hashing power in the mining network (not the nodes) to deliberately introduce orphan branches, and to profit by spending coins on one branch, then orphaning that branch, and paying the same coins to themselves on the replacement branch

He's claiming some malicious actor has suffucient funds to dominate mining for long enough, for the purpose of destroying Bitcoin. This is probably the tenth thread suggesting this possibility. The reason this keeps coming up is this:  
*    the White Paper mentions 51% mining attacks as the most significant risk arising from the way Bitcoin is designed  
*    it also says, as you said, miners work for financial incentive, and mining rewards are a greater incentive than the likely profit of a 51% attack  
Therefore, concern trolls invent a scenario where an extremely wealthy attacker who can afford to lose billions launches a 51% attack to disrupt or destroy Bitcoin and receive zero financial reward

Would it be possible to replace plain text authentication of RPC access with asymmetric key-pair access? This would allow safe access from external networks, as well as prevent the exploit described  
Two separate keypairs could allow  
*    the RPC client to safely identify the server, and  
*    the server to limit RPC access to known users

Why HDD for the Blockchain?  
It's cheaper and more reliable  
The Blockchain data is a series of blk0nnnn.dat files, each one is appended to until it reaches almost 128MB, and then never updated  
For the cost, and the failure risk of SSD, it's better to have the Blockchain on HDD  
For the initial build, there is a speed advantage in having a small SSD for the chainstate directory. The databases and indexes there are randomly written and rewritten constantly. Use a symlink

Bitcoin amounts only exist in one place, each output of each transaction  
The amount is a positive integer number of Satoshis  
All these discussions about divisibility ignore the mechanism which might be used to implement smaller subdivisions  
There are multiple options, but the most sensible would be this:  
Make a name for the new subdivision - my choice is Chaum  
Let's say the consensus is to have 100,000,000,000 Chaums per Bitcoin  
Use version number to signal that a transaction's outputs contain Chaum amounts (new transactions) or Satoshi amounts (old transactions)  
**Any transaction which spends an output from an old transaction must be coded to recognise that there are 1000 Chaums in a Satoshi**

Whenever you like  
I read back through all the technical discussion about block size, and the sensible technical consensus is that the optimum block size is somewhere between 200k and 400k  
Considering the constraints discussed in the BitFury paper, the risk of causing the node count to collapse is too great to consider increasing the block size,  
perhaps until 90% of all devices in use - server, desktop, laptop, tablet, phone - have at least 16GB RAM. This is probably 3-5 years away  
  
Anybody who wants larger blocks should float a new coin, without hijacking the Bitcoin chain in the process  
If I decide it's important to reduce block size to 300k, I will create a new coin with small blocks, not attempt to impose my brilliant ideas on Bitcoin

The wording in your OP seems to have a reverse meaning of fiat  
This is confusing  


Somewhere, possibly  
Not China  
On the street, China is a cash economy, coins and notes  
The IMF recently published a similar suggestion  
  
Unfortunately, their view and your suggestion have a huge flaw  
Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, fintech, whatever buzzword (IMF's distributed ledget tecnology, DLT) is an inter-operation of several different components to create a self-balancing, self-sustaining digital currency  
I'll leave the details to Satoshi's origin paper. He writes better than me  
The flaw is in believing this technology can work just by picking and choosing the components you like and excising the unwanted parts  
For the IMF, and for a Government cryptocurrency, they would try to discard the components which make Bitcoin independent of any control  
Bitcoin is great, let's make one which we can manipulate, change the parameters at will, inflate, revalue, devalue, issue Government bonds  
No thank you  
Bitcoin works because nobody controls it  
It works because its append-only immutable transaction ledger prevents manipulation and fraud  
It works because thousands of separate full copies of the ledger are distributed to thousands of independently operated nodes, effectively preventing any possible fraud conspiracy  
Bitcoin can not work if any component of this inter-operation is removed or compromised. There is no "near enough" partial Bitcoin design which can work  
The IMF will try  
At least one Government will try  
They will fail  


The fault is that the Government controls it  
If they replace fiat with a Government-controlled blockchain currency,  
it will have the same fault

Download the source code for any Bitcoin wallet software  
or [bitcoin-tool](  
You might need to download the code for the secp256k1 elliptic curve separately  
The same applies to the SHA256 code and RIPEMD160 code  
Bitcoin Core source code does not have external dependencies for SHA256 RIPEMD160 or secp256k1. It's all there in one place  
bitcoin-tool does not handle SegWit addresses  
Don't get stuck on compressed vs uncompressed public keys. Choose compressed  
Read the source code - the parts which derive public keys and addresses - and understand it thoroughly  
Each calculation is simple but it might take a few hours to get your first address  
Does your calculator handle 32-digit hexadecimal numbers?  


This is trivial. Integer base conversion is a 30-minute high school lesson. Convert your 256 bit string to hexadecimal - 4 bits per hexadecimal digit. Convert to base58 using the standard method from high school - divide and record the remainder, repeat. Details about the base58 character set used by Bitcoin, and the application prefix and checksum suffix are here  
  
When dividing, remember that 58 is 3A in hexadecimal

No  
Make sure you own the address you're moving the coins to  
Do not send them to Coinbase  
Then, if there is someone running replay bots, the replay just moves the 2X coins to the same address (your new address) on the 2X chain, and you still own them  
More likely, there will be nobody playing replays on 2X because there is no reward in it, in which case your coins will still be on your old address on the 2X chain, waiting for you to spend them  
Wait a few days to see that replays are not polluting the 2X chain  
Keep track of confirmation times, hash rates, on both chains  
When you're fairly certain that both chains have reasonably stable block confirmation times close to 10 minutes, do this ...  
Send your coins to yourself on both chains at the same time, so they confirm in the next block, using a different receiving address on each chain  
IMPORTANT: make sure the receiving addresses on both chains belong to you, in your wallets
Use the 2X wallet to move the coins on the 2X chain - this wallet does not yet exist  
Use your regular Bitcoin wallet to move the coins on the Bitcoin chain  
If both chains confirm your transactions at the next block, then you're protected from replay  
Both new addresses are post-fork, so they are also protected from replay  
You now own the same value on 2 different post-fork addresses on both chains  
You can send your 2X coins to one of the exchanges which provides instant altcoin-&gt;Bitcoin exchange service  
Profit!

I would guess LBC are waiting for confirmation from the victim or the victim's bank that the refund arrived. The bank is probably declining to communicate, for privacy reasons, and the victim probably doesn't understand that he/she is blocking your refund by not communicating  
LBC should tell you if that's the cause of the delay  
although that makes you informed, not refunded

Thanks to the brilliant invention of asymmetrical cryptography in 1977  
The signatures are created using the private keys before sending the transaction  
Verify that the signature matches the public key  
Verify that the public key matches the address which owns the Bitcoin

This is new  
Therefore no existing metrics apply to it  
A token with zero tangible value  
Price growth USD400 -&gt; USD10000 in 2 years  
Obviously a bubble, even the most outrageous overvaluations in the dotcom IPO boom didn't go that far, and some of them had zero tangible value, one with a prospectus with a business plan: We'll work out the business plan after the IPO  
If you have the time to browse through old threads, there are a small number of calculation attempts, all with unsupportable assumptions, most recently - if all the world is Bitcoin, then 17 million Bitcoins represent the entire wealth of the population of earth, etc  
An older one - if Bitcoin's use as a currency makes it 1% of the world money supply, then 1 Bitcoin is 1% * 75 trillion / 21 million =approx 36000  
The metric which is known, and is ignored in price calculation discussions, is the Bitcoin maximum transaction rate. A Block is created every 10 minutes, and is no larger than 1MB, therefore (given the average size of a transaction) Bitcoin can process up to 3-4 transactions per second  
With recent and near future improvements in transaction size (SegWit and Schnorr signatures), this number can increase to about 10  
Ten transactions per second. This is not a single global currency  
Some more wild speculations - what if Bitcoin is one of many, if there are 5000 cryptocurrencies each processing 10 transactions per second. Now we have a global ecosystem of cryptocurrencies with a capacity of 50000 transactions per second, and Bitcoin is one of many, so it's value is a one-five-thousandth fraction of the total  
Calculations of the price of 1 Bitcoin then depend on whether cryptocurrency is 1% or 15% or 100% of the world money supply. The value works out to somewhere from $1 to $100 per Bitcoin  
At this point I've deviated from the scripture  
The prevailing view here is there is "One True Bitcoin" and every other cryptocurrency is disparaged as an altcoin or a shitcoin  
The transaction limit will supposedly be addressed by an unviable idea known as side-chains, of which Lightning Network is the leading contender  
A small group of outliers believe transaction throughput is only limited by the developers' stubbornness in refusing to increase the block size above 1MB. The outliers have a plan to gradually increase the block size up to or above 1GB. Again this is unviable, actually ludicrous  
Now straying too far from the "ultimate price" question, except that the transaction throughput is probably one of the variables in any price calculation formula  
Referring back to the origin document, the intent of Bitcoin was to fill the gap where online purchases can only be made using centralised payment systems - credit cards - and those systems are censored against some transaction types: online gambling, donating to controversial political activists, Nazi memorabilia, file sharing, etc  
In the real world this payment censorship can be evaded by using cash. Bitcoin provides a cash-equivalent choice for online purchases  
Nine years later, and the devotees express a belief in Bitcoin as a means to replace fiat currency completely, with various political and pseudo-political motivations  
In between the minimal ambition of the original developer, and the world revolution view of the devotees, there is the possibility that cryptocurrency is such a great idea that it can displace credit cards completely for Internet purchases. The potential risk for merchants if their customers' card numbers are revealed is a huge liability. Cryptocurrencies do not carry this risk, because all the secret numbers are tightly held by the customer, and only cryptographically signed, tamper-proof transactions are sent over the network  
Make a formula. Set up several scenarios with different values in the formula variables. Test the sensitivity of each variable. Discover a range of possible values for a Bitcoin. I suspect USD1.00 might be optimistic, depending mainly on the number of cryptocurrencies sharing the transaction volume, and the transaction rates of the 3 scenarios  
* minimal cash equivalent for some online transactions  
* all online transactions  
* complete fiat replacement  


I see two possibilities  
* Bitcoin is not a pyramid, but the end of the bubble is similar to the collapse of a pyramid fraud, eventually the sucker market is saturated and there are no new suckers to keep driving the price up  
* the bubble burst could be triggered by a major world event. If Saudi Arabia declares war on Iran, there will be an oil price shock, and a lot of Bitcoin investors will liquidate so they can afford the gasoline to drive to work every day

The problem is the OP misunderstood the way Coinbase uses addresses  
When you have a Coinbase account, they give you an address for adding Bitcoins to that account  
When you withdraw Bitcoins from a Coinbase account they use an "internal" address, because they consolidate dozens of withdrawals into a single multi-output transaction  
OP noted the sending address of the withdrawal,  
then later assumed that was the right address to use for depositing into his Coinbase account,  
sent the transaction, didn't get the coins
Err, a bit long-winded  
Shorter version  
OP deposited to Coinbase, did not use the address Coinbase assigned for depositing to his Coinbase account  
used a different address, the sending address from the old withdrawal transaction

Thanks for clarifying  
Yes, that's logical, but there's no sign of it - at least in this subreddit  
(and no other places I'm aware of)  
The main reason for the kneejerk responses in "Can I mine Bitcoin?" threads is that mining moved to a large scale industrial operation a couple of years ago - large data centres full of miners located close to cheap power sources, mostly in China  
The monopoly ASIC supplier uses their own equipment to mine Bitcoins, in competition with their customers, a conflict of interest which is to the detriment of ordinary miners  
The assumption driving the kneejerk is that the small-scale home miner has been shut out of the market  
Regarding difficulty  
The current fluctuations are related to some political game  
The details are boring, but they're spread all over this subreddit and another one  
In the medium term, there will be an increase in mining hashrate, and then an increase in difficulty when the next delivery of Antminer S9 is available in mid-January  
In 2017, the hashrate increased from 3Exa to 11Exa  
and the difficulty increased in proportion  
  
This might not be repeated in 2018,  
but this whole market is so new that nothing is predictable  
There's the gamble. It's inherently unpredictable, and there's an established large-scale infrastructure with an unfair commercial advantage competing with your miner  
On the positive side, there's no advantage in scale for the large mining farms. The only advantages for them are access to cheap power in a distorted power market, and cost-price access to the miners from the factory

To pay 5%, they have to lend for at least 7%  
The margin has to cover costs and bad loans, and profit  
To guarantee 2-hour withdrawals, the loans have to be short-term, like overnight. Then if there's a withdrawal run, they can still honour withdrawals, with a next day delay  
More likely, the plan is a Ponzi. Use Reddit and other social media to promote 5% interest and 2-hour withdrawal guarantee. Get popular. Use new deposits to pay interest and withdrawals for existing customers. Run away and hide when the rate of new deposits is no longer sufficient to prop up the scam

But I really do not trust the common sense of ordinary people to govern themselves in small groups, that in practice this will often be more oppressive than the big anonymous State

Yes you do, and it takes days

Your wallet is instantly able to look up the address index

The point of proof-of-work is to slow down the creation of new blocks, so that the network has sufficient time to propagate each new block, and sufficient time for nodes to reorganise after discovering a stale chain tip  
An additional benefit which flows from this is that an old block can not be modified without repeating proof of work for that block and all its descendants. In a network with sufficient hash power, redoing historical proof of work is impossible

Your pre-requisite is not necessary in this scenario  
Bitcoin was obviously not invented by any Government  
More likely that a Government or other oppressive large organisation will recognise what a great idea it is and attempt to steal the idea and displace Bitcoin  
This has already begun  
* The IMF has already published a plan to embrace blockchain technology, but to suppress decentralised currencies such as Bitcoin  
* Similarly, read the recent Russian announcements  
The fundamental weakness in these Governments and bureaucracy blockchain plans is that they see only one component of an integrated system - the blockchain - and deny that the decentralised network is essential to prevent corrupt manipulation of the blockchain  
Therefore, they are setting themselves up for an inevitable failure - A Blockchain (hooray, great idea, an immutable append-only ledger), with centralised control (we are the Goverment / the IMF, control is our raison d'être)  
Holding central control, they will be unable to avoid the temptation to manipulate the blockchain, tamper with it, corrupt it  
Nobody will trust Government blockchain, IMF blockchain, tamper chain  
Everybody will embrace decentralised Blockchain currencies

All good points about incompetence and ignorance  
I recall an earlier thread about 2X pointing out that the NYA corporations, despite their wealth, failed to fund a developer team  


I'm not sure this is the right word, because decentralisation has a different meaning in the Bitcoin network context  
The disagreement is about control of the software development process  
Some businessmen were frustrated that the Core developers refused to increase the block size,  
so they tried to take over the software development  
Open source development is free and public  
The Bitcoin Core group have a common goal,  
even while they disagree about some things  
Decisions are made by consensus, not hierarchy  
Instead of finding a team of developers who agreed with their cause, the businessmen played a political game  
Old businessman thinking - PR and money wins power  
Old thinking failed  
Welcome to the Internet, old-thinking businessmen  
To displace the Core developer team properly, the businessmen would need to understand the collaborative nature of open source software, build a new team of developers who are favourable to 2X, and have them work in parallel to the existing group - probably for at least 18 months  
This would require some patience  
Then the new team would probably realise that bigger blocks are a bad idea  


Now that is a big topic to argue about  
Embedding executable code into a transaction record is clever, but not smart - one of those concepts which should stay in Computer Science academia, and never be attempted in the real world

You are contradicting your question  
Create a new address for every payment,  
record the address beside the order  
When the payment arrives,  
the receiving address tells you exactly which order to apply it to
Set up a watch-only wallet  
Put all the addresses into it  
It will tell you when every payment arrives  
This is the normal process for accepting Bitcoin payments:  
* for individuals  
* for non-profits receiving donations  
* for merchants  
Your objection makes no sense  


If you have many customers, you will need a proper order / receipt / fulfillment system  
A separate address for every order gives you confirmation of the payment for each specific order - confirmed by the Bitcoin system itself, for free  
Also address re-use is a very bad practice

Not necessarily  
You can sign a transaction offline  
Also, the private key has zero value after you sweep it  


If you import the key into an existing HD wallet then you will lose the key when you restore that wallet from its seed  
If you import the key into a new non-deterministic wallet then you have to be diligent about backing up that wallet  
The Bitcoin gods have decided that users are all too stupid to backup non-deterministic wallets, and insist that everybody must now use HD wallets only, no backups required  
and that sweeping a paper wallet is more secure because it moves the Bitcoin value from the paper wallet to one of the keys in the (warm and fuzzy, no backups required) HD wallet  
It's true, many users are too stupid to properly manage backups  
No statistics available for comparison, but there are some users too stupid to take care of their seed words also  
  
**EDIT**  
I forgot the other risks of paper wallets  
The private key on a paper wallet is exposed to anybody who can see it or make a copy  
Did someone give you a paper wallet as a gift or as payment or as a way of selling you Bitcoin for cash?  
If so, that person may have kept a copy of the private key  
Did a visitor to your home see your paper wallet lying on a coffee table?  
Maybe they took a photo while you were out of the room  
After importing the paper wallet, did you discard it in the trash?  
Maybe your local [dumpster diver]( found the paper  
After you sweep the paper wallet key, it has no value  
On the other hand, if you store is safely, and then import the key, it is a useful backup of that key

Bitmain lost money supporting the BCash fork price  
Their motivation is to recover some of those losses  
Miners are motivated to follow the most profitable chain  
The NYA signal is irrelevant  
2X will fail. Miners will continue to flip from BCash to Bitcoin and back, until eventually BCash fails too, and Bitcoin is the only profitable chain to mine  
No disruption to Bitcoin in this scenario  


Miners are for profit, not to lose money by freezing block creation on the Bitcoin chain

The verification part of the initial sync is not very slow, by default  
because it does not begin from the genesis block  
  
The slow part of initialisation is not downloading either  
The average broadband Internet user in USA, Canada, Europe can download the Blockchain in about 4 hours, but the initial sync takes much longer  
The initial sync is slow because it uses inefficient disk access methods to find transaction inputs and outputs to build the UTXO database  
This could run a lot faster with a sort + sequential merge process  
Would require enough disk space to store 2, possibly 3 separate copies of the Blockchain, each with different sort order

The amount of mining is driven by profitability  
Mining rewards are in Bitcoins  
Mining costs are in fiat currency  
Therefore, one of the variables driving the amount of mining is the current Bitcoin price rocket  
Lower prices mean less mining, and lower power consumption  
When the bubble bursts,  
the price will fall to less than $2  
many miners will abandon Bitcoin  
the power consumption will be negligible

Yes, read Section 7 of the whitepaper  
This is a very complex suggestion, because it requires perfect definitions of "redundant and or useless" and "what's absolutely necessary", and your suggestion that everything up to 2016-12-31 is redundant, is very naive  
Doing this properly (using Satoshi Section 7) would require only deleting transactions which have been fully spent - where every output has zero value because it has been spent in the input to a later transaction  
It would also require deleting only the detail data of the obsolete transactions, leaving behind the merkle hashes which are necessary to prove that the blocks have not been tampered with, and the block hashes to prove that all the blocks chain together back to the genesis block  
This would save a lot of space  
There is nothing except time, coding skills and motivation stopping anybody from coding this pruning technique and implementing it on their own node, sharing it with other node operators, propagating it to nodes which are modified to support the pruned chain  
In a wider sense, there's a long-running discussion about the definition of "what’s absolutely necessary". The prevailing view is that the entire history of transactions is absolutely necessary, and that the size of the Blockchain is not a significant problem - about $10 worth of hard disk space, less than 10% of the space on a normal 2TB desktop HDD  
As long as the size of the Blockchain is an insignificant problem, there is no urgency to even start thinking about Satoshi Section 7 pruning

There is a simpler option, but only for type-1 (P2PKH) Bitcoin addresses. Why use a PGP key? Bitcoin uses cryptographic signatures for transactions. The same Bitcoin keys can be used to sign arbitrary messages  
The merchant can sign a message with the Bitcoin private key associated with the address generated for this transaction. The signed message proves the merchant owns the address. One catch is that it can not be automated because all the merchant's private keys should be off-line. Another catch is that signing a message exposes the merchant's public key to the customer. Normally the public key is secret until the merchant spends the coin  
Another catch is that nobody has standardized a way to sign a message and prove signature using SegWit addresses
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:46:08


Pedantic note: target, not difficulty. Difficulty is inversely proportional to target. See the Wiki to understand the definition of difficulty  
The target is not defined by counting leading zero bits. It is written in the Satoshi White Paper as leading zero bits, but is actually a maximum integer value, to allow for finer adjustment  


32 bits is only about 4 billion. A single mining device hashes 50 trillion per second. This means that every mining device exhausts the 32-bit nonce in about 80 microseconds - thousands of times every second


This happened several years ago  


Correct, a miner has to modify something in the transactions thousands of times per second. The network does not get thousands of new transactions per second, so it is ineffective to try and change the set of transactions in the block (but see extra note below)  
The actual solution is referred to as "extranonce". It is a clever way to change the transaction data without materially changing the transactions  
The first transaction in every block is always the block reward transaction. It contains at least 2 outputs. The block reward is a normal transaction output with the mining pool's address and the reward amount (including tx fees). The other output is an OP_RETURN. OP_RETURN is useful for storing 40 bytes of arbitrary data in a transaction. Miners use it for communicating with the pool, sometimes to tag the pool's ID code  
Some bytes in the miner's OP_RETURN are used for extranonce. It's not part of the Bitcoin protocol, so there are no rules about the format or length of extranonce. It's typically left to the miner to update it (not the pool) and it's normally a random bit-string  
Changing the extranonce on the block reward transaction causes that transaction's ID hash to change. Changing one txID hash is enough to change the Merkle tree root hash in the block header. The miner can cycle through the 32-bit nonce in 80 microseconds, and then change the extranonce again  
**EDIT**  
But see the comment. The extranonce is in the signature of the block reward transaction's input, not the OP_RETURN output  
**extra note**  
Miners can change the set of transactions in a block while mining, and they often do this several times for each block. This is unrelated to the extranonce mechanism

How much RAM - 1GB, 2GB or 4GB?  


No, the bottleneck is CPU power. You can get a speed increase if you add more RAM to dbcache - if you have 4GB RAM, set dbcache to 2500  
Also, if you plug in a small (16GB or more) SSD or even a thumb drive, as well as the HDD, then configure Core to write chainstate to the Flash device and write blocks to the HDD, you can save some time  
chainstate contains indexes and the UTXO database, gets written and overwritten constantly  
blocks are written, appended to the end of the chain, never updated or deleted, read constantly  


The last Pi node initialization reported here was 5 weeks for a Pi3  
The Pi4 should be about 40% faster, then faster again if you have 4GB RAM and allocate 2500MB to dbcache

Shallow analysis  
The primary cause of 2008 crisis was fraud committed by mortgage borrowers lying on their application forms,  
exacerbated by a conspiracy between those borrowers, their brokers, their banks, the merchant banks buying the mortgage bundles and the ratings agencies, all conspiring to cover up the fraudulent mortgage applications  
And then a cycle of re-financing where the early exit penalty payment is paid using a fresh loan supported by fraudulent 
over-valuation of the property

Using the master key, the wallet should be able to find all the addresses

It's just data, so choose from dozens of options for backing up data  
A private key is only 32 bytes long, so it's really easy to back up  
The backup procedure is 100 times less important than being certain you can use the backup to recover your Bitcoins  
Flash memory is unreliable because it is subject to sudden 100% failure  
Hard disks, the same, but slightly more reliable  
Paper is subject to obvious failure modes: fire, ink fading, mold, insect consumption  
Optical disks (CD, DVD) have partial failure modes due to gradual degradation  
Multiple copies in separate locations reduce the risk of recovery failure  
You are protecting your Bitcoins from different types of losses  
Protection from theft is not identical to protection from forgetting a password or other losses by negligence - laundry, other housekeeping accidents  
You might use encryption to protect from theft  
If you use encryption, you also need to protect the encryption key and/or passphrase  
Separating value by storing Bitcoins on multiple keys can reduce the quantity of accidental or theft loss - partial loss  
but storing separate keys in separate places requires managing the list of storage locations  
Storing keys in an error correction format - QR images or par2 recovery blocks - can improve recoverability from partially corrupt backups  
A private key is really small - 32 bytes - so if you're backing up to optical disk, you can store thousands of copies of the same key on a single disk, which helps recoverability from a partially corrupt disk  
Remember that dementia might prevent you knowing a hiding place or a password when you need it in future years  
Make sure your beneficiaries are able to recover your Bitcoins from your backups in the event of your death  
and **Finally**  
to be sure you can use your backups when you need them  
Periodically check your backups to see if they've degraded  
Replace any damaged backups with new copies

Every time this comes up, the majority of responses are "pay your taxes" and "I  am happy to pay my taxes"  
So it would seem there is no appetite for mass non-compliance,  
or everyone here is government agents  
If income tax non-compliance becomes an issue because of the anonymity of cryptocurrencies, then the same non-compliance is likely with transaction taxes, profits taxes, turnover taxes, payroll tax  
Governments will tax  
Faced with mass non-compliance and enforcement failure,  
they will have to levy taxes which do not rely on reportable money amounts

A coin is a transaction output  
A coin can have any arbitrary value  
A coin can only be spent once  
A coin can only be spent completely, no partial spends  
This means that unless you're lucky to have a coin with the exact value (plus fee) that you want to spend  
*    the transaction will always have a change output  
*    the transaction might have to use multiple inputs  
A Bitcoin address is single-use

"Store of Value" is not a serious concept in relation to Bitcoin  
The term was borrowed from economics as a facile justification for Bitcoin price speculation  
The speculators care only about their own greed. They do not care about Satoshi's purpose. They do not care about Bitcoin as a payment method  
Could Satoshi have designed Bitcoin differently, to deter price speculation? It is interesting that the coins least susceptible to speculation are the ones with an unlimited supply schedule - Dogecoin and Grin  
But no, the speculators are here, pumping Bitcoin's price thousands of times higher than Bitcoin's value, spouting their store of value, scarcity, adoption, regulation bullshit, shouting "hodl to the moon"  
Every speculation bubble eventually bursts. The timing is impossible to predict. Afterwards, Bitcoin will again be useful for payments, even for micropayments  
Meanwhile, embrace Grin and hope it remains uncontaminated by the speculators

either at home or by renting GHashes from butterfly labs  
I looked at buying a butterfly miner back then  
or buying hashing power from butterfly labs  
I looked at some online calculators,  
realised that the difficulty level automatically adjusts upwards as more hashing power is added,  
that every extra Ghash increases the difficulty level,  
making mining returns always negative  
Fortunately butterfly labs was always sold out,  
and I have an aversion to advance payment

Alternatively, Electrum on an offline computer has similar options for importing a private key and displaying the private key and address in appropriate formats, also displays QR codes

The CloudFlare reverse proxy service does allow CloudFlare to read all the data which transits CloudFlare's proxy servers  
You can not run a HTTPS proxy without decrypting all the traffic as it passes through. The CloudFlare proxy holds the TLS certificates for CloudFlare customers' domains. The ephemeral encryption key is negotiated between the browser and the CloudFlare proxy. All the traffic is in plaintext as it transits the CloudFlare proxy  
This is why the Cloudbleed incident was such a big deal. Each proxy serves between 30 and 50 domains. The Cloudbleed bug allowed CloudFlare customers to see the traffic belonging to other CloudFlare customers

There is no customer. There is a marketplace for buying and selling Bitcoin. This market sets prices according to the whims of the buyers and sellers. Very few of the sellers will be miners. In general, the miners will accept the market rate, and can not influence this rate by asking a higher price  
On the cost side, the cost will fall in proportion to the number of miners who retire due to unprofitability. If the global hash rate falls 50%, the cost to mine one Bitcoin falls 50%

A private key is any string of 256 bits from 0x1 to 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140  
Bitcoin uses ECDSA and the secp256k1 elliptic curve to create a public key from a private key, and to sign a transaction with a private key  
Keep your private keys safe from accidental loss or theft,  
and you will never lose your Bitcoins  


One transaction in one block on the Blockchain has one output which contains a Bitcoin address you own and a positive integer count of Satoshis  
This is your coin, also referred to as a UTXO - unspent transaction output  
Safely stored on an offline backup, or an offline wallet, or both, there is a private key which corresponds to the address in that UTXO  
Your complete control of this private key gives you the sole right to spend the coin/UTXO

Bitcoin Core, using the --noconnect option on an offline computer, can also tell you the address which corresponds to each private key

The triangulated lattice steel floor supports were spray coated with fire retardant foam which made the steel fireproof up to some extreme temperature  
Unfortunately, the aircraft collision scraped the fire retardant coating off the steel, then the burning fuel softened the steel, then the floors pancaked onto the lower floors  
Yes, the coated steel would have survived the burning fuel  
But the building engineers failed to predict that a hijacked jet would penetrate the building and scrape away the retardant foam  
The buildings were carefully balanced from top to bottom, so it only required buckling in one part of the steel floor support on one floor, then that floor falling onto the one below it, then it's pancakes all the way down

OP_RETURN is useful, although the practical uses - invoice reference numbers, and similar - are questionable  
The etiquette issue is clear. The Blockchain is for recording financial transactions. Storing non-financial data is extraneous to this purpose, selfish freeloading  
OTOH, spam is constrained by the 40-byte data limit and the minimum (current node default) fee cost of 1 Sat / byte  
You could store a 4GB movie file in 100 million OP_RETURNs and pay 4 billion Satoshis (40 BTC) in fees  
The other issue (which everybody likes to ignore) is that Bitcoin was not designed to be a permanent record of every transaction back to the genesis block  
Bitcoin has become a permanent, ever-growing ledger, but was originally supposed to be heavily pruned - all fully-spent transactions deleted because they perform no role in consensus  
Ultimately, the impracticality of infinite growth will bring Satoshi's pruning design to Bitcoin  
In a longer timeframe, coin expiry will be necessary to prevent unconstrained growth of the UTXO set  
If you eliminate the myth of the permanent ledger, then there is no room to use the Bitcoin Blockchain for permanent timestamping, notary hash storage, proof of copyright, etc, because these functions assume permanence  
A permanent data storage Blockchain would be a great idea, but needs some attributes which are missing from Bitcoin. It is not feasible to store something for free (or for a small once-only fee) and expect it to be stored forever. The economics require periodic maintenance payments to keep your data stored. The fees need to be distributed to the node operators. Payment to miners is not consistent with this use case

When I mine, I buy one or more mining devices, plug them into power and network and join the Bitfury pool. My devices send messages to the Bitfury pool manager 3 or 4 times a second. Whenever a Bitfury pool member mines a block, I get paid a small portion of that block reward 2 days after the block is mined  
I control my mining hash power. Bitfury does not control my mining hash power

It could not be exactly identical software  
You would need to made a few small changes to make sure your coin has a completely separate blockchain, node network, and mining network  
The launch of Litecoin was like this, but they also changed the mining hashing algorithm and the block interval. They use the same address format, and started a different blockchain  
So far, nobody has created a new coin as an exact copy of an existing one, but it would be just like the Litecoin launch only simpler

These are informative:  
  
  
  
Generally, with a turnover of about $30k per month, a Bitcoin ATM pays for itself in less than a year, so it's worth doing  
In other threads, people will warn you about other costs, especially compliance costs - up to $100k for lawyer fees and liquidity requirements

and a lot cheaper than the cheapest in the list

The poll is not about consensus
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:49:53


I've expressed an unpopular opinion about this a few times in the past  
The initial build time can be reduced by discarding spent TXOs from the Blockchain. There is a specification for pruning fully-spent transactions from their blocks in the original White Paper. It leverages the Merkle hashing tree to allow transactions to be deleted without invalidating the calculation of the Merkle root hash, therefore keeping the block header intact  
Bitcoin consensus does not require keeping full history forever. A new transaction is valid if its inputs are spending outputs which exist and which have not already been spent. Spent TXOs have no role in this validation  
I said this opinion is unpopular. There are loud voices objecting to the suggestion that fully spent transactions can be pruned. These voices insist that keeping full history is essential  


Yes, the Moore's Law reference was inaccurate. But you're using this Satoshi quote out of context. The actual context refers to the infinite growth of the Blockchain by 80 bytes per block. A block is reduced to its 80-byte header after pruning all the transactions, if all the block's transactions are fully spent. Satoshi was describing the slow growth of the Blockchain **if his transaction pruning design is implemented**

This deductive chain assumes that miners are the only source of supply  
Most Bitcoin has been mined already and market sellers provide liquidity. New Bitcoin created by miners has an insignificant effect on market liquidity. Miners are at a disadvantage to other market participants because their fiat costs - power, shelf space, equipment depreciation - can only be covered by selling Bitcoin quickly  


This is literally false. The halving does not reduce the supply. It reduces the rate of creation of new coins. The supply is increasing at 6.25 per block instead of 12.5, but still increasing

Also, Bitcoin mining was a penny hobby for years after Bitcoin was launched  
Miners do not need financial incentive  
When the financial incentive falls, after the price bubble bursts or after the next (or the one after) halving, greedy miners will retire. They will be replaced by altruistic miners. Mining will cost pennies, in the same way that non-mining nodes cost pennies

People who practice good address hygiene - an address is a single-use token, never reuse addresses - are not at risk because none of their coins have exposed public keys  
People who reuse addresses are at risk of losing their coins  


Where people reused addresses and lost their keys, this quantum concern post claims those coins can be recovered  
Also, in the early days Bitcoin transactions were pay-to-public-key, not public key hash, so all those coins are hypothetically vulnerable to this quantum risk  
There will be plenty of warning if this risk ever becomes real, so people who still have their keys will be alerted to the need to move the coins they have on exposed public keys

No  


Insignificant  


Two ways:  
* the speculator bubble will eventually collapse, the price will fall to $2, and this will reduce mining to sensible levels  
* if Bitcoin was modified to remove financial rewards for miners, then greedy miners would be replaced by altruistic miners  
The current energy usage for Bitcoin mining is caused by the race to the bottom effect of profitability calculations. Bitcoin mining is inherently unprofitable, because Bitcoin automatically reduces the reward per miner in proportion to the number of new miners  
The Bitcoin speculator bubble, a rapid price increase which has no rational basis, makes mining more profitable than it should be. When this bubble bursts, most miners will retire and electricity use will fall to sensible levels  
Removing mining rewards would eliminate the for-profit miners and they would be replaced by altruistic home miners, in much smaller numbers, using hardly any electricity

Bitcoin is stored as transaction outputs. The address is just part of the output  
A transaction has inputs and outputs. Each input spends exactly one output from an older transaction - no doubles, no partial spending. This means there is a firm link connecting the input back to the output being spent  
In your A+B -&gt; C transaction you are associating your A and B addresses because both inputs are in the transaction. However, in Bitcoin there is no proof that the same person owns the A and B addresses. It's a small transaction with 2 inputs and one output, therefore it is highly probable that both inputs are owned by the same person. Then the fact that A and B were both funded from the same Coinbase account means that Coinbase knows you own both A and B. Coinbase is a promiscuous data sharer, as required by regulation  
Nobody can tell if address C belong to you or a friend, or a random stranger or a merchant. The fact that the transaction has only one output means you're sending the entire value of A and B to one person, makes it unlikely to be a merchant, unless your A+B amount happily coincides with the price of the merchant's product. Not proof, but your transaction has no change output, so it's 99.5% unlikely to be a merchant purchase. So the spy is 99.5% certain your transaction is to yourself, or to a friend, or maybe a "this is all my spare Bitcoin" donation  


Not for certain, all transaction tracking is guesswork. The only certain link (see above) is the link from an input back to the output being spent. Inputs and outputs in the same transaction are "linked" softly by being in the same transaction. The point of the CoinJoin mechanism (Wasabi wallet or JoinMarket app) is to collect inputs from unrelated people and send outputs to unrelated people. A 2-input/1-output transaction like your A+B-&gt;C can be guessed to probably have 3 addresses owned by the same person. A multi-input multi-output CoinJoin gives hardly any clues about who owns the inputs and outputs  


Coinbase is not a spy. They pay spies to analyze transaction patterns. Read the privacy page:

Yes, but it depends ...  
*    if your original transaction is RBF, you can replace it with a new transaction spending the same coins, with a higher fee  
*    if your transaction is not RBF, you can help it confirm faster by creating a new transaction sending the change output to yourself. This is called "child pays for parent" - CPFP  
*    if your transaction is not RBF and does not have a change output, you have to wait a few days for enough nodes to expire the transaction from their mempools. Then you create a new transaction and send it

The block header is 80 bytes. Calculate the block header hash by feeding that 80 bytes into the SHA256 algorithm  
SHA256 is a trapdoor function. You can calculate the result very fast, but you can not predict the value of the input which will create a pre-specified result  
When a miner submits a new block to the network, he doesn't send the SHA256 hash. He sends the entire block. Then every node in the network calculates the SHA256 hash of the 80-byte block header. If the value is too high, the block is rejected by every node

The halving doesn't "happen". The correct block reward is calculated **every time a new block is added** to the Blockchain. The block reward transaction is checked to ensure the reward amount is accurate  
The calculation relies on the block number  
*    define the original block reward amount (50 * 100 million) as a binary integer, 64 bits long  
*    divide the block number by 210000  
*    shift the block reward that many bits to the right  
Right-shifting a binary integer is a fast method of dividing by 2  
Right-shifting a binary integer by 3 bits is a fast method of dividing by 8  
When block number 630000 is mined in 2020, the divide by 210000 result increases from 2 to 3, the 50 Bitcoin amount is right shifted 3 bits instead of 2 (divided by 8 instead of 4), the reward decreases to 6.25 Bitcoin  
From src/validation.cpp  
    CAmount GetBlockSubsidy(int nHeight, const Consensus::Params&amp; consensusParams)
    {
        int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;
        // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined.
        if (halvings &gt;= 64)
            return 0;
    
        CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
        // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
        nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;
        return nSubsidy;

More accurately, it means sending, selling, withdrawing, and then in the replacement block, spending the same coins to yourself. The coins have to be spent on both branches to be a double-spend.

Even more anonymous is the WAVES Dex, but handles fewer coins and some coins have low liquidity. Where there is liquidity for the coins you're trading, the WAVES Dex is dirt-cheap and exchanges are fast. Withdrawing Bitcoin from WAVES DEX is slow and expensive - 0.0004 Bitcoin withdraw fee, 2 hour delay  
If you want instant exchange (like shapeshift and changelly used to be), try fox.exchange

So Terpin has an unrealistic view of his phone security - because he didn't expect number porting would be possible without an insider exposing his number to thieves, and the shop (and AT&amp;T) allowing the number porting without his password and ID

The missing details - this story has been written in at least 20 news sites and blogs - are how a phone number port can be used to access a cryptocurrency exchange account

Your Bitcoin keys and addresses are generated from a "seed", a list of words which you wrote down when you first set up the wallet. You can also access those words from your blockchain.com account. Knowing the word list allows your scammer to create his own wallet containing all your keys and automatically send your Bitcoin to himself every time you receive Bitcoin. You give a stranger the login details, he finds the seed words, you lose Bitcoin. Changing your password does not save you if the scammer has your seed words  


This is vague, but could be a more sophisticated scam common with blockchain.com wallet users. The scammer adds his own Bitcoin addresses to your wallet. A wallet containing addresses is known as "watching-only". It can tell you the amount of Bitcoin sent to those addresses, but that Bitcoin is marked "unspendable". The scammer sends some amount of Bitcoin to the watching addresses in your blockchain wallet, tells you it's a gift. You see that your gift is unspendable. The scammer tells you to send a top-up amount (to him) to make it spendable. If you send the top-up amount, you lose that money. This is a variation of [advance-fee fraud]( You pay a small fee to facilitate a large windfall payment. You lose the fee. The windfall does not exist

The halving will improve decentralization  
Bitcoin mining has an automatic adjustment mechanism, to align the amount of global hashpower to the 10-minute block interval. This means that adding more hashpower makes mining a folly of diminishing returns  
Miners who stay in the game despite diminishing returns are operating on a fine margin. The margin quickly turns into a loss if the hardware fails or becomes obsolete before it has paid back its purchase price  
Large miners are more susceptible to turning a small profit margin into a loss because they have higher fixed costs and a larger sunk investment. The halving is a once-per-210000-blocks income shock. Larger miners will be affected more than smaller miners because they have less flexibility to reduce their fixed costs and more exposure to capital write-off. The halving should be more kind to small miners  
Unlike conventional manufacturing, Bitcoin mining has no economy of scale. Huge losses made by Bitmain in 2018 are proof of this  
The effect of the halving will be barely noticeable when it happens because the timing has been known in advance since January 2009  
It is possible that Bitmain's 2018 financial disaster and subsequent withdrawal from mining was caused by financial planning in anticipation of the 2020 halving

But Google Authenticator does not require a user to use the SMS recovery option, and any service which depends on SMS is generally accepted to be insecure (because of the number porting risk)  
The exchanges are making Google Authenticator mandatory for 2FA (Binance for example), but they don't make SMS recovery mandatory  
User's choice, user's losses, why blame the exchanges?

It's very simple to send Bitcoin to another country for a few cents, but ...  


The answer is different for every country. In many countries it's not possible. In a few places you can sell to an ATM, and lose 15%, which makes WU cheaper. In many third-world countries there is only one Bitcoin exchange, charging 8% or more to sell. Again, WU is cheaper. If they can sell Bitcoin for cash, to a friend, or a street trader, and the price is fair, then it's better than WU. But who's going to buy Bitcoin from you if you're in a country where no exchanges are buying Bitcoin for a fair price?

My cryptography is not strong enough to be certain, but the way I read it is that it apples to EC public key derivation, not just Bitcoin. It probably does not apply to non-EC asymmetric key pairs  
An EC public key is 512 bits long. It represents a point on an elliptic curve, 256 bits for the x-coordinate, and 256 bits for the y-coordinate. Because the exact shape of the curve is known, you can derive the y-coordinate from the x-coordinate plus a flag telling whether the y-coordinate is odd or even. Therefore, storing the y-coordinate in unnecessary, a waste of space. The x'02' or x'03' indicates the odd-or-even of the y-coordinate  


I'm reading an old discussion about this which tells that the values x'04' for uncompressed, and x'02'/x'03' for compressed are required for manipulating EC key pairs in openssl. Openssl's libssl library was used for all EC key generation, signing and signature verification in the early versions of Bitcoin, until a new secp256k1 library was developed specifically for Bitcoin  
  
Summary:  
*    truncation by discarding the y-coordinate is safe because the y-coordinate can be calculated from the x-coordinate and the parameters describing the shape of the curve  
*    the space is saved in the signatures which contain the public key, reduces the size of every input by 32 bytes. The public key proves the validity of the signature. The public key also proves the ownership of the address of the UTXO being spent  


I forget, but a wild guess is that it might eliminate one form of txID hash malleability which was one of the purposes of SegWit

The proper process for Bitcoin refunds is for the merchant to ask the customer which address to send the refund to  
Most merchants, and all the middleman payment processors, send the refund to the sending address of the original transaction  
Because you paid from your Coinbase account, the sending address is just an arbitrary internal Coinbase address, not your Coinbase account's receiving address  
The good news is that you know the details of your spending transaction, so you should be able to see the refund transaction by checking the original transaction's sending address on a Web Block Explorer site  
If the refund transaction is there, then you need to explain to Coinbase that those coins belong to you

Yes  


Yes, and there are a standard set of techniques for managing this volatility risk  


Holding as little as possible  
Converting to fiat currency as often as necessary to minimise risk of sudden devaluation of held Bitcoins  
That is one of the risk management techniques  
The others are:  
* setting Bitcoin prices according to the prevailing exchange rate, minute by minute  
* adding a price buffer to cover the risk of sudden fluctuation  
* setting a time limit for payment - a few minutes or a few hours, depending on transaction value


This is an extreme hypothetical  
No sensible analysis expects cryptocurrency to replace fiat currency  
If it happens, it will be the reverse of your description - that is, fiat currency will fail first, then be replaced by something else, possibly cryptocurrency  


Of course not. The world is full of places where 2, 3 or more currencies are accepted interchangeably. Businesses in the non-Euro countries in Europe happily accept payment in Euro

It is an estimate  
Miners communicate with their pools whenever they have a valid share to report. The pool defines a valid share by setting a mining target which is much easier than the official target - easy enough for each miner to report a share many times per minute  
In the probability context, the average hash rate required to discover a valid share is known. It is a simple proportional calculation: `size of total sha256 space / size of target range`  
Here, target range is the count of integers from zero to the pool's share target  
Because the pool target is high enough for every miner to discover many valid shares and because there are many miners in a pool, the actual hash rate (for a single pool) is very close to the probability calculation  
I would guess that most pools (maybe all pools) are willing to report their current pool target and the rate of shares being reported by pool members. By collecting this information live, an accurate estimate of global hash rate can be calculated

It's simpler. The hash is calculated by applying the SHA2 algorithm to the 80-byte block header. The block header contains several elements. One element is the previous block's hash, but it has no direct influence on the new block's hash. It is just 32 bytes out of the 80 being hashed. The 4-byte nonce is important and the 32-byte Merkle root hash is important. These two elements can be changed repetitively until the hashing calculation meets the requirement of being within the current target range

It grows at roughly 50 million per year, which is a lot, but not significant in this discussion  
The issue is that the node initialization time is proportional to the number of transactions on the Blockchain, not the number of UTXOs. Initialization builds the UTXO DB inefficiently - add every output to the DB, then delete it when the spend appears. There are simple ways to make the UTXO DB build faster (see below), but the current process is known to be reliable. Bitcoin's integrity relies on the accuracy of the UTXO DB. If a spent coin is accidentally left in the UXTO DB, it can be double-spent  


This smells like centralization to me, a very bad direction for Bitcoin to take. I reject any option which requires trusting a small number of large players, and I echo the concern expressed by about ever-increasing node initialization times  
Faster UTXO DB build:  
Instead of building the UTXO DB by adding every TXO, then deleting it when a matching spend input is found, run an incremental sort/merge/match routine. Sort all the TXOs by txID+number for some arbitrary number of blocks, maybe 500. Sort all the inputs by TXO txID+number, for the same set of blocks, plus looking ahead 500 more blocks. Merge/match the two lists. Any matches are spent TXOs, do not add them to the DB. Because most TXOs are spent shortly after creation, this avoids the overhead of adding/deleting any TXOs that are spent within 500 blocks of being created. After the first round of sort/merge/match, there will be UTXOs in the DB. All these UTXOs need to be included in the subsequent sort/merge/match. The UTXOs remaining when the most recent block has been processed **should** be exactly the same as with the current, slow process  
This could also work as a single huge sort/merge/match with a list of all inputs matched against a list of all outputs, and the unmatched outputs then get loaded in bulk into the UTXO DB. The catch is that the resources required to sort 500 million transactions in one go could be challenging. Yes, you can initialize your node faster - as long as you have 1TB of disk space and sufficient RAM to make the sort process run efficiently  
An incremental version would save almost as much processing time, and only needs enough resources to sort each incremental set of blocks. The 500/500 suggested above is an arbitrary guess. The actual optimum number of blocks to sort, and the look-ahead number, would be different  
I'll repeat the warning above. The UTXO DB must be accurate. Any change to the build process must be thoroughly tested. Speed is less important than the integrity of the data

On the surface it looks like you're being asked to be a money laundering courier  
But the history of these stories is that the first transaction, sometimes 2 or 3 transactions are used to establish trust, to make you trust the scammer. Then he asks you to send Bitcoin today, promising cash in a few days. Then he has some excuse to delay the cash payment, probably asks for more Bitcoin, and this repeats for as long as you still trust him. You lose when he doesn't pay  
Note that if the amount was actually large - $600 is not large - then the job is more likely to be money laundering work. However, money laundering criminals rarely trust random strangers with large amounts of cash

You're missing the point. Your proposal keeps the middleman and only changes the method of payment. Your article even details how bad the rent seeking is in your field. Bitcoin - and the Internet - offers the opportunity to sell direct to the reader, to eliminate all the rent seekers  
Stop writing books, begging publishers for advances, losing huge percentages of your royalty payments to the rent seekers. Publish on the Internet. Charge a micropayment to read. Automatically monitor demand, and automatically increase price in response to higher demand. Publish some pages for free - demand payment to "read more"

Not enough zeros there  
In Satoshi's White Paper, this is written ...  


There are 256 bits in a SHA2-256 hash. Your zero-string only has 40 zeros  
Secondly, adjusting the target hash by changing the number of leading zero bits is a crude adjustment - the value of the target hash can only be adjusted by a power of 2. The actual target is a maximum value. Mathematically, the target is a range from zero to the current maximum. Adjusting the maximum has the same effect as increasing or decreasing the leading zero bit count, but allows for finer adjustments  
What happens when difficulty is so high that the target range only has one possible value - zero? This will never happen. Hashing processors can never be powerful enough to discover a block header with a zero hash in 10 minutes. The 256-bit hash size prevents this hypothetical ever coming close

The keys wouldn't be private if they're stored on the public Blockchain  


Amounts are never updated  
A coin has an amount when its transaction is created  
And then is worth zero when it is spent by the creation of a later transaction  
The transaction output which contains a coin is never updated - the Blockchain is immutable  
Here is why pruning is hard:  
* A transaction output is a coin when it is created  
* It is no longer a coin when a new transaction spends it  
* Immutability means the transaction is never changed  
* Therefore the only way to tell if an output is spent is to scan the entire Blockchain searching for the transaction which spent it, and  
* The only way to know it is a coin is to scan the entire Blockchain and find no transaction has spent it  
The simplest way to make a list of all the coins (unspent outputs) is to scan the entire Blockchain, linking every transaction input to the transaction output it is spending, and when the scan is finished, the remaining transaction outputs are the coins waiting to be spent  
This is why nodes carry the full Blockchain

The difficulty adjustment was designed before the current BCash fraud operation which rapidly shifts large amounts of hashing power from chain to chain  
It would be unwise to make a hasty change  
Part of the reason this problem occurred is because BCash added an emergency difficulty adjustment to their blockchain shortly after launching  
The BCash EDA is being exploited by the fraud because it was poorly designed, makes it easy to manipulate the hash rate on BCash and trigger the adjustment deliberately  
A new hard fork in BCash aims to fix this loophole  
Soon we will know if the BCash EDA hard fork is effective  
The incompetence of the implementation of the BCash EDA should be an object lesson for Bitcoin users - never make changes in a hurry

A chain is a series of blocks. Each block is mined by a single, different miner. There is no concept of "monopoly mining"  
The prospect of a 51% attack from turning "a bunch of old miners back on" ignores the logistics, assumes miners are sitting on a shelf, plugged into a ready power supply, instantly available to the control of a malicious actor  
And then there's the actual risk. Who loses from an "attack"? In the recent history of 51% attacks on other cryptocurrencies, the currency was not attacked. Crypto-crypto exchanges were attacked.

This is simpler than my first comment, because of the timing - the ancient history of Bitcoin  
The raw transaction question is a diversion. I would guess that the particular trust method they chose for Tulip was using features of Bitcoin which were available in Bitcoin, but not supported by any wallets at the time - time-locked transactions and multi-signature addresses  
The agreement to destroy the keys is more interesting  
There is a time-locked transaction, already on the Blockchain, with a deferred payment date. Because it's already on the Blockchain, its inputs are already spent. The owners of the output addresses are due to receive payments from this transaction on the nominated date  
I would guess that Phil's USB transaction is spending Phil's output of the time-locked transaction. The time-locked transaction does not mature until 2020, so he does not have the money  
Still not clear why keys need to be destroyed. I can see that if you sign a transaction, destroy the keys and then store the transaction cold, this prevents the transaction's inputs being spent by your friends before you're ready to activate your cold transaction. You have to trust your friends to destroy their keys, but the reason you're asking them to destroy the keys is because you don't trust them not to spend your coins!!  
The reason this is not making sense is that this trust case is supposed to be handled by multi-signature addresses. You trust that the last signer - usually an escrow agent with no financial interest in the transaction - can be trusted to sign the transaction according to pre-agreed rules. Key burning is not required

Decentralization of the node network is to protect Bitcoin from interference by regulators and corrupt politicians who want to censor transactions. If a regulator sees your 50 nodes, she can shut them all down at once. If 50 nodes are operated by 50 people in 50 countries, the regulator can only shut down one

Here is a graph:   
The vertical axis indicates how many transactions are waiting to be included in a block (confirmed). The colors indicate how many unconfirmed transactions in each range of fee rate. The horizontal axis is time  
The graph is spiky because every time a block is confirmed, about 2000 transactions get moved out of the unconfirmed set  


If there are fewer than 2000 transactions waiting, then your transaction will be confirmed in the next block or two 
If there are few new transactions arriving, and if there are 8000 transactions waiting, then yours will confirm in less than 5 blocks  
If the rate of new transactions is constant or increasing, you might have to wait from 4 hours to 36 hours  
The best time to submit a low-fee transaction is when the graph peaks are low and the troughs are dipping close to zero

On paper?  
There are dozens of mining calculators  
Each one has several input boxes, and assumptions  
Then you make assumptions when you fill in the boxes,  
and the calculator tells you whether there's a profit  
Question your assumptions  
The two most common flawed assumptions are these:  
* the price will never fall  
* the difficulty is constant  
Anybody who started mining in the past 2 years has had increasing prices, so that part was safe for them, but no guarantees for the next 2 years  
The difficulty increases, especially when the price is increasing  
The existence of a profit margin attracts more miners  
More miners means more difficulty, means lower profit margin  
Most mining is now in a small number of regions in china where the power price is the equivalent of USD0.04  
If your power is USD0.04 or lower, you can have the same profits as those miners  
Otherwise, you're making a loss  
That's how thin the margins are  
Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment automatically keeps the profit margin wafer thin  
One miner in a bedroom with USD0.15 power will not compete with the Bitmain chicken sheds of inner Mongolia paying USD0.04 for power

You are foolish to ridicule this view. Bitcoin is decentralised to protect it from transaction censorship. Consensus rules can only be changed by consensus, slowly. Quick changes can only be made by central powers. Central power is an attack surface, a vector attracting regulators and hostile corporations to enforce payment censorship  
If the choice is between  
*    uncensored Bitcoin dying because consensus changes are slow  
*    appointing a CEO or a board of management to make quick emergency changes, attracting regulation and transaction censorship  
then the second choice doesn't get off the starting line, because censored payment systems already exist, PayPal and Visa. Bitcoin's main purpose is to provide a system for uncensored payments

What I'm saying is that I reject the current false dichotomy in the scaling debate - the choice between making blocks bigger and moving transactions to a second layer. Neither option actually scales to 2 billion tx/day  
Start with today. Bitcoin blocks fill for a few hours at a time, at least once every week. People wait a few hours, some people are aware of the congestion, pay higher fees for faster confirmation. Litecoin blocks are never full. Litecoin fees are a tiny fraction of one cent. Wherever I spend Bitcoin, the merchant also accepts Litecoin and usually a few other coins. I check a graph which tells me the current size of the Bitcoin mempools, use Bitcoin if there's no congestion, Litecoin otherwise. There's nothing special about me doing this. I know thousands of other Bitcoin users are following the same process  
Move forward a few years. Everybody has caught on to this idea, and now Bitcoin blocks fill once or twice every week, and Litecoin blocks fill once or twice a week - usually at the same time. Now we're processing 300k Bitcoin tx/day and 1.2m Litecoin. Maybe Litecoin is struggling because its 2.5 minute block interval can't handle this volume  
Someone makes a new coin, an exact copy of Bitcoin with a new genesis block, a brand new chain. Now there are 3 chains to choose from, to spread the transaction demand between. We're good for another year or two - assuming transaction volume continues to increase  
Where does this lead? A slow, ad hoc, organic response to mempool congestion, full blocks, increasing transaction volume, no software changes, no complicated sidechains  
Psychology gets in the way a little bit. There's a part of the community committed to the One True Bitcoin, rejects the existence of other coins. I'm ignoring this cult, their beliefs tie them up in congested blocks, long confirmation delays and high fees  
Stand back from the forest, look at the big question - is there a way to process 2 billion tx/day. Do we do nothing, allow the community to launch a new Blockchain every few years, to address scaling organically? Or do we proactively build a new design, a variant or improvement of Bitcoin, designed to be parallel-scaled as the volume requires, where the ultimate goal has 4000 or 5000 (or some other number) parallel Blockchains evenly sharing a rate of 2 billion transactions per day  
I'm on the fence. Half of me wants to do nothing and watch the organic method work through the force of user demand  
The other half wants to build a better Bitcoin, with a self-pruning Blockchain and coin expiry, and with a cross-chain swap mechanism to level the load across all the chains  
My third half believes that Bitcoin is nothing more than a niche for a small subset of online transactions - where PayPal is unavailable for censorship reasons, or where PayPal is unsuitable for privacy reasons. After the speculators leave Bitcoin, these transactions easily fit into its 300k-500k tx/day capacity for decades - no scaling required

Checking block header hashes is super-fast, but as you say, gets slower as the chain grows  
Every node cross-checks all the block hashes when it is initialised, but not every time a new block arrives  


Transaction pruning, as specified in the Satoshi White Paper, section 7, replaces full-spent transactions with their hashes, and over time, replaces pairs of hashes with the Merkle hash of hash-pairs. Eventually a block contains only fully-spent transactions, so the only data in the block is the 80-byte header  
As the oldest blocks have all their transactions pruned, it should be safe to start the cross-checking of the block header hashes from the oldest block which still contains transactions  
The spoiler to this is that there are many unspent outputs which are very old and may never be spent, including block 1. This could be "fixed" with coin expiry - an idea which frightens people: "I want to pass my unspent coins to my descendants for hundreds of years into the future. Do not steal my coins". You should consider coin expiry for your new blockchain if you want to avoid infinite growth  
Pruning fully-spent transactions, combined with coin expiry, would keep your blockchain and your UTXO set at a constant size forever  
There is another method, which was implemented in Bitcoin some years ago, and was later abandoned - checkpoints. If you look at the Bitcoin source code you will see hard-coded hashes for a list of block numbers. This means a node only needs to cross-check the block header hashes starting with the most recent checkpointed block. The problem with this is that imposes a trust requirement which is incompatible with the principles of Bitcoin's design. Every new node has to trust the coder who maintains the checkpoint hashes. This is why the practice was abandoned

The mining reward falls from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC in May 2020. Price optimists claim that to support the mining economy, the USD price of BTC has to double so that miners can earn the same amount of USD after this halving. The halving date has been known since 2016, therefore it makes sense that the market would anticipate the price doubling - the double price happened many months before the halving happens. If the OP's statistic shows Bitcoin more than double its price 12 months ago, this means the price has already doubled, and the halving will have no further price impact

Your side-scrolling box is not usable  
Please edit, it has most of your arguments in it  
and they're mostly based on a false understanding of Bitcoin  
and a dishonest portrayal of fiat currency and the stock market  
I'll start from the bottom  


Yes, there was a tech bubble  
It was a 'greater fool' bubble  
It burst  
The piece of history conveniently omitted from most discussions:  
That bubble ended in a specific week,  
when the largest number of vested options became eligible to be exercised  
The dotcom bubble was a scam managed by the IPO bankers and venture capital investors  
Bitcoin is not directly comparable,  
because Bitcoin is not a stock in an operating business  
Bitcoin has no owner, no manager, no bankers,  
it's simply a self-balancing, self-sustaining set of networked computer programs  
So it is not a scam  
It is a bubble  
People believe in paying $10000 for it,  
even though everybody knows it is a token with zero tangible value  
These facts are transparent, nobody is lying, if people are going to lose money when the bubble bursts, they know they took that risk when they invested  
Bubble - YES  
Scam - NO  
Delusion - maybe  


Nothing exciting, only the obvious  
The price goes down, investors lose money  
Bitcoin (see above - self-balancing) continues  
even if the price falls below $2

Bitcoin was being developed during this period, but was definitely not a response to that financial failure. The public mailing list record proves that most of the work was in progress before the 2008 failure  
Bitcoin was developed to fill a gap where consumers are unable to pay cash for online transactions. Many transactions are impossible online because the centralised payment services (Visa and others) have political and commercial and corrupt reasons to ban them. In the real world these bans can be circumvented by using cash at the shop counter  
Bitcoin provides a cash-equivalent payment option for online payment services  


Excluding Venezuelan bolívars and Zimbabwe dollars, Argentine australs and pesos, Brazil reals - the list is really long, even includes the Euro  
But seriously, fiat currencies are manipulated by national banks and sometimes national governments to avoid fluctuation on the Forex markets  
You might be claiming that the definition of a currency requires that there is a national reserve bank to manipulate its Forex trading  
That definition would fail any logic test  
Bitcoin is a currency without a national reserve bank  


The HODLer argument, just as foolish when you write it as when they do  
The facts:  
In August I went to a Bitcoin ATM, inserted some dollars, received $90 worth of Bitcoin  
A few days later I spent $10 of Bitcoin on an online service, an annual membership fee for a private forum  
Last week I spent $48 of Bitcoin on an annual fee for access to a Usenet service  
I have $120 left  
Sorry to blow away your "opportunity cost" argument with a practical example  
Bitcoin is a useful currency, for the original design purpose I described above, a cash-equivalent payment option for online purchases  
When the bubble bursts, and the price falls to $2, I'll lose about $30 (net), if I don't spend any before then  
Then I'll go back to the ATM, buy another $90 worth,  
and continue using it as a currency  


Lazy research. This is completely false. The fee is calculated per byte. I chose the fee to pay for the two transactions described above: 22 cents and 20 cents, about 11 Satoshis per byte  


So true, a 'greater fool' bubble, mass delusion  
It will burst eventually  
Party!  


Great example, since we're discussing delusion

Most exchanges charge 0.0003 - 0.0005 Bitcoin for their transaction fee for the withdrawal transaction. They're overcharging by 100 times. They keep some of the fee, and they also overpay transaction fees to avoid confirmation delays. Fee overpayment by exchanges drives up the average  
Coinbase Pro is a notable exception. They don't charge withdrawal fees - but they still pay a lot more than minimum fee

Large-scale mining will not be profitable  
Profit-oriented miners will retire  
They will be replaced by altruistic miners  
Transaction fees are chosen by the transaction sender, not charged by the miner. Nobody will volunteer to pay hundreds of dollars for transaction fees just to keep miners in profit  
The price will be below $2  


This does not happen until 2140  
The profitability hit on miners will happen much earlier than 2140, because the mining reward will only be a few Satoshis, because the speculator bubble will burst and the price will fall below $2  


Correction, the speculation narrative. Speculators will leave Bitcoin when the price falls

The 'U' means uncertainty. Bitfinex's refusal to submit to audit and come clean about the fractional backing of Tether is the cause of the uncertainty. They could have removed uncertainty with regular audits in 2017, 2018 and 2019

But you think it's OK, and then when the 1-for-1 promise is broken and Tether is redeemed for 0.75, you'll think that's OK too, and eventually when the amount of fiat reserves turns out to be only 30%, it's OK to reduce the redemption amount to 0.30  
Because how can anybody pay $1 if they only have 30 cents in the bank? Sorry we lied about all those promises, but it wasn't our fault, really

A 12-word seed phrase can have a so-called 13th word, which serves as an encryption passphrase for the other 12 words. The 13th word should be multiple words, as many as you would use for a passphrase, for example a 7-word diceware passphrase. Then you store the 12 words on paper and memorise the 7-word "13th word". This gives you same same amount of encryption strength as Veracrypt, without  the overhead of a single-purpose disk partition and the risk of loss from disk failure  
  
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:45:48


Ironically, the knowledge that a run on Tether redemptions would deplete the USD reserves is probably preventing a run. But this is an ostrich view. It may not last forever  
Then again, the stable value of USDT, in spite of the shortage of USD fiat to back the redemption promise, could be proof that fractional reserving is a healthy way to run a bank
@_date: 2019-04-29 02:06:15
People mention this all the time, but it is a very weak argument  
You're ignoring the fact that the transaction fee is set by the sender, not the miner. Bitcoin users really have no incentive to help Bitcoin miners feed their families. If Bitcoin blocks become full, some users will pay higher fees - up to a point. Other users will switch to a cryptocurrency which has low fees  
Your fee marketplace collapses because of the existence of multiple alternative coins  
Increasing the block size serves no purpose, for other reasons - centralising the node network, and only being a temporary relief, not a solution

*txindex* maintains an index of transactions. This index allows the node software to quickly finding which block (and which blk file) contains a transaction with a known transaction ID  


The *txindex* provides fast lookup of transactions by transaction ID, not by address  
The Core node has no equivalent index for addresses  
The normal operation of a Core wallet is that a new wallet has a collection of unused addresses (and keys) and no transactions. When you send or receive transactions, the node processes every new block as it arrives and builds a transaction list inside the wallet file for the wallet's own addresses. This serves the function of an index of the wallet's transactions  
When you import an address into the wallet, if that address has transaction history, the only way to find those transactions and add them to the wallet is to *rescan*. This searches the whole Blockchain for all transactions relevant to the new address. Yes, it is slow. *txindex* does not make it any faster  
To make a rescan go faster, the developers would need to add an address index. I am guessing the reason for not doing this is that they consider importing addresses to be an unusual process. Also, until a few years ago, a rescan only took an hour or two  
This means the Core wallet is suitable mainly for managing its own addresses, and that importing addresses has a cost - slow rescan  
If you need a fast lookup of transactions by address, you can get this by installing an ElectrumX server with your node. Then you need to use the Electrum wallet, and tell the Electrum wallet to only connect to your own Electrum server  
Note that the initialisation time for creating the indexes for ElectrumX is very slow, but you should only need to do it once

Every node is connected to every other node using the Internet  
The network connection topology is irrelevant to Bitcoin mining power use, since the power is consumed running brute force hash calculations until one calculation matches the success condition  
The brute force hash calculations are network-independent  
Miners only access the network to collect transactions at the beginning of a new block, and then the successful miner connects to the network to broadcast the successful block to the node network

About a year ago, I decided to manage this issue by separating wallet, keys and transactions  
My wallet is only for day to day transactions, so it only has enough keys for this purpose  
This works best if the keys are non-HD, "just a bunch of keys", generated randomly. Alternatively, use the BIP39 tool offline to generate HD keys there  
Store a few thousand keys in an encrypted file, offline  
Import a handful of keys into the wallet as needed  
Export the transactions and store them in a different encrypted file, offline  
Most of the time, keep the wallet empty, except for the current unspent coins and enough addresses for incoming transactions and for change. Avoid accumulating too many unspent coins  
I don't keep a high value of Bitcoin. If I did, I would keep most of the value offline  
I can start a new wallet from scratch any time  
I can use any wallet software which supports importing private keys, without having to worry about wallet backups, seed words, HD derivation paths, other incompatibilities between HD wallets, key gaps  
The key file was set up once only, never changes. Multiple backups are checked and verified every 3 months. Any degraded copies are replaced with good copies  
The transaction history file needs some discipline to keep up to date, mainly because it serves as a record of which keys I have already used. I never reuse addresses. If the transaction history is properly maintained, the wallet itself is throwaway

The UTXO database can be characterized as the list of transaction outputs left over after matching all the transaction inputs in the Blockchain to their corresponding outputs in prior transactions  
What checks are there to ensure that no spent outputs are accidentally missed by the matching process and then incorrectly included in the UTXO list?

Ignore the regulators. Don't build a bloated decentralized infrastructure. Accept the reality. There are conformists who will play in the regulation sandpit. Ignore them too. Everybody else can build a real-world face-to-face network for converting between cash and cryptocurrency, and stay completely away from the regulated onramps. Regulation will soon include rules preventing withdrawal from an exchange to a personal wallet - only known wallets operated by other exchanges will be permitted, with surveillance and with exchanges sharing their customers' personal details. This will force a choice - buy your Bitcoin in person between friends, or join the regulation and surveillance sheep. There will then be two independent Bitcoin markets - the surveillance market prohibiting the use of personal wallets and the face-to-face market refusing to use regulated exchanges. The separation of these markets will create differential prices. The face-to-face market will have honest prices. The regulated market will be corrupted by custodial exchanges and derivatives contracts, fake Bitcoin supplies and fractional reserves

Double spending means spending the same coin more than once. This is not possible in Bitcoin because every new block is checked by every node. A block is rejected if it contains any double-spend transactions  
The text you are quoting is talking about replacing unconfirmed transactions. The term "double spend" is used loosely in this context  
The wording would be more precise if it said "software that allows posting a replacement transaction to the network" and "safeguards against posting replacement transactions"  
Then the discussion should be expanded to explain that there are many legitimate reasons for posting replacement transactions, and mechanisms which support posting replacement transactions

You're probably right, but is anything instantaneous, and how would calculus work if graphs had infinite gradients (vertical lines)?  
To have a vertical line - because when a block is mined, all its transactions disappear instantly from the mempool - there would have to be 2 mempool counts at exactly the same time with 2 different numbers  
The graph represents the fact that data points are sampled periodically. The slope measures the time between the last data point before block mining and the first data point after

Bitcoin is not an investment. It is suffering a temporary speculation bubble, which will eventually resolve itself when the bubble bursts, the price falls below $2, and the speculators go crawling back to the make-money-fast and penny stock pump-and-dump sewers they crawled from  
Bitcoin is a currency for buying and selling goods and services on the network. It is analogous to using cash in meatworld transactions, suitable for any transaction where the participants want to use a payment method which is not encumbered by the baggage of the centralised online payment methods - censorship, insecurity, surveillance  
Bitcoin is suitable for this type of payment - until its blocks are full. When this problem happens (again), the resolution is to use another, similar cryptocurrency which has empty blocks, like Litecoin

Or no method at all, so the email messages are a fantasy designed to make the "Putin did it" story more credible. Without these "emails", the story crumbles into this:  
Somebody who used a Bitcoin exchange and a Bitcoin wallet used Bitcoin to buy a domain name and a VPN service  
By "redacting" the investigation methods relating to the emails, there is no credible proof that the emails even exist  
I choose to believe that Mueller invented the email messages in order to tie the Bitcoin activity to the GRU. The whole story hangs on this single thin thread - a few lines of text in a single, unproven, email message  
(Not to mention a money laundering indictment for amounts totaling less than $20, pathetic)  
I'm a huge Trump hater, but this investigation was a massive waste of time and money, a wild goose chase driven by pre-emptive assumptions about the result, and nobody with the courage to admit those assumptions were wildly optimistic, nobody with the common sense to abandon the investigation when it was obvious early on that all the pre-investigation assumptions were nothing more than a paranoid conspiracy theory

Doesn't need to be pruned for this method to work. The Blockchain never changes, only grows bigger. This means you only need to periodically post the new BLK files (100MB per day) and the full set of indexes/databases - about 5GB. You have to make sure the databases align exactly with the blocks  
There is also a lot of value in distributing a pruned Blockchain, plus databases, for people who don't want to wait for the download. This would be about 6GB

**EDIT**  
I just noticed this "U2F" in another context. U2FsdGVk is base64 for "Salted" which are the first 6 characters of an AES-encrypted file. I see the OP took his bat and ball and went home. For the sake of completeness, I think "Salted" is what you will see if you base64-decode a wallet which encrypts the whole file. The Core wallet encrypts the individual private keys. Best guess is that a wallet file beginning with "Salted__" is a Multibit wallet. The encryption password is required to access the wallet  
Extra note: "Salted__" does not necessarily mean AES encryption. It could be a different cipher which also uses salting to derive a key from a password/passphrase, 3DES for example

Bitcoin borrowed transaction signing from asymmetric cryptography  
Anything about Alice and Bob will probably help you understand  
  
  &lt;-- this one forgets to mention that Alice has to send Bob her public key ahead of time. In the office scenario described, this probably happened on the day they started working together  
All the Alice and Bob tutorials rely on a trust which is established by a real-world "I know who you are" trust model. The beautiful innovation in Bitcoin's use of cryptographic signatures is that it is a variation of "trust on first use"  
In Bitcoin, first use is when someone sends Bitcoin to a Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin address is stored in a transaction output. A transaction output is a coin waiting to be spent  
Spending a coin means creating a transaction with an input which points back to the coin being spent. The transaction input contains a reference to the coin being spent, the public key, and a signature created using the private key  
Proof requires two steps. The public key is used to prove the signature. Then, the public key is hashed, and proof requires the hash to match the Bitcoin receiving address of the coin being spent  
In the Alice buys coffee from Bob context ...  
  
Alice's wallet created a new key pair and address. Alice sent the address and some fiat money to Joe and Joe sent Bitcoin to Alice's new address. Alice wants to pay Bob for coffee with a Bitcoin transaction. The transaction input points to the transaction output (coin) from the earlier Joe Bitcoin purchase transaction. The transaction input also contains a signature, created by signing the transaction using the private key from the Joe transaction. The transaction input also contains the public key from the Joe transaction. That public key has not been disclosed before. Alice sends the transaction to the Bitcoin network. The transaction is added to a block and the block is added to the Blockchain by a miner. Every Bitcoin node receives the new block, then validates the block, and all the transactions in the block. To validate Alice's coffee transaction, a node will verify the transaction signature using the public key, and then will hash the public key and check that the hash matches the address from the Joe transaction

The Snowden quote is the most important issue. The issues raised by the title are temporary, and being fixed already  


Before the end of 2020, all these transactions will be replaced with either one-time tokens generated offline by your card, or using asymmetric cryptographic signatures similar to Bitcoin transactions. This should have been done in 1996, when carding theft first became an epidemic. Instead they made a half-useful workaround, the 3-digit CVV/CVC as proof that the card was in the possession of the purchaser  
Sending your card number, expiry date, name and address, and the CVC proof will soon be ancient history

Bitcoin seed phrases are typically used to create a deterministic list of keys and addresses for future use. The answer below assumes you only need a single address on each art work, because exposing a real seed phrase exposes all future keys. I also assume you want to use arbitrary words, not constrained by the official Bitcoin BIP39 lists of 2048 words  
A Bitcoin key is an arbitrary bit-string, 256 bits long. Make up your phrase. Hash the words using SHA2-256. Use bitcoin-tool to convert your 256 bits to the appropriate format for use as a Bitcoin key. something like this ...  
    wordlist='unvalued irrigate happiest grafted velocity voice tableware bunion prozac mummified crisped sixties'  
    bitcoin-tool --network bitcoin --input $(echo -n $wordlist|sha256sum|cut -c-64) \  
    --input-type private-key --input-format hex --public-key-compression compressed \  
    --output-type private-key-wif --output-format base58check  
Then import the key into Electrum to get the addresses  
  
This is insecure. Your written purpose appears to have no concerns for security. In that context, it's a good idea  
This is a form of brain wallet. Because nobody does this in any known wallets, you need to explain to your puzzle solvers the above method for deriving the key from the word list. The important part is that the hex format of the private key is created with `echo -n $wordlist|sha256sum|cut -c-64`

This was true in the early days. Now it is false  
Transactions are verified by node operators. Most node operators are not miners  
The only purpose of mining (proof of work) is to create a 10-minute interval between blocks, so that the node network has enough time for every node to keep its copy of the Blockchain up to date. Mining is a dumb race to be first to discover a valid block header hash for the next block of transactions  
Next time you plagiarise something you read elsewhere, make an effort to do the research to understand how it really works

The smart people here will warn everybody not to use some other person's copy. The point of running your own node is that you're supposed to verify all the blocks yourself  
Most important, if you download some other person's UTXO database (the part which takes days or weeks to build), you don't know if they added a few extra coins which have already been spent  
Personally, I think this is a good idea, but it is a lot of work to keep publishing daily updates

This is not relevant. Nobody knows which Bitcoin keys belong to Satoshi. People **guess** that Satoshi mined a lot of the early blocks, and assume that the block reward addresses must be Satoshi's. This is wrong because Satoshi was not the only miner. It is wrong because all the early keys were probably lost because Bitcoin was worth pennies until about a year after pizza day

Every transaction has inputs and outputs  
Every output is a coin, which can be spent once only  
Every input is a backwards link to a coin (output) on an older transaction  
A coin has an amount and an address  
If you control a private key, then you have the power to spend the output on the Blockchain which contains the address which was derived from that private key. You own that coin because you have exclusive knowledge of that private key  
Digital signatures are a special type of mathematics in cryptography. Start with a key-pair - private key and public key. Share your public key with someone you intend to send messages to. Sign a message with the private key. Send the message. The message recipient can prove to himself that you signed the message with your private key because he knows your public key  
Bitcoin creates a key-pair, and then uses a cryptographic hashing algorithm to create an address from the public key. You tell someone this address. He creates a transaction to send Bitcoin to that address. One of the outputs on his transaction is your coin  
Later, you want to spend the coin. You create a transaction. The transaction input is a backward link to the output in the transaction described in the previous paragraph. Your Bitcoin wallet app signs the transaction with your private key and adds the signature to the transaction input. The public key is embedded in the signature  
The Bitcoin network is a collection of computers which run software to process every transaction. To prove that your transaction is valid (that you own the coin you are spending), the public key is extracted from the signature, then hashed to prove that it matches the address on the coin being spent. Then the signature is proved against the public key

Yes, there's an information gap. I don't use Knots, but assuming the CLI is the same as Bitcoin Core, the CLI information is available using `bitcoin-cli help`. That gives a list of commands, and then `bitcoin-cli help getwalletinfo` gives detailed information about each command  
Apart from that, node initialization is slow. You can monitor progress using `tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log` as already suggested by Any more?  
Mostly, you can leave it running, unmonitored. I have a screen window running the above `tail` command. I check it daily if I remember  
You can experiment with all the CLI commands if you have the spare time, learn new things, follow the deep rabbit hole. It can be fun to monitor the progress of your own transactions in your own node's mempool

That's easy the solar enthusiasts say, just install batteries, look at those stylish Telsa power walls.

An offline Electrum is online as soon as you plug it into an online PC. A hardware wallet is still offline when it is plugged into a PC  
You can keep an offline Electrum wallet offline, and never plug it into a PC, but you still have to copy transactions between an online PC and the offline Electrum PC if you want to spend Bitcoin  
This is more work, requires more understanding of Bitcoin, and takes more time, compared to using a hardware wallet  
A TailsOS PC is an online PC. Also, Tails does not remember anything unless you specifically tell it to, so it offers a great opportunity for deleting your Bitcoin keys forever, very securely  
Whichever option you choose, you have to know what you are doing. A hardware wallet offers a lower-effort way of looking after Bitcoin, for a high price  
Even hardware wallets offer easy ways to lose Bitcoin

This is not true. It is possible that a future quantum computer might use a particular theoretical algorithm to discover EC private keys from public keys, but these quantum computers might never exist  


Change addresses should not be reused. Every transaction gets a new change address. There is really no difference between a change address and any other receiving address. The public key is exposed when you spend the change coin. There should never be more than one coin for any address, therefore all the exposed public keys belong to private keys which have zero value

I will not watch the interview. If there is a transcript I will read it. Your description of Phil's transaction purpose is a bit vague, missing some details  


Nothing special, just a Bitcoin transaction where the user completely controls every component, instead of letting the wallet choose the input coins, the fees and the change address  
Raw transactions are easy to construct using Electrum commands, or using coinb.in, and more difficult using bitcoin-cli commands  


Three major steps for raw transactions:  
*    Construct an unsigned transaction from inputs and outputs  
*    Sign the transaction. If the inputs are owned by different people, collect all their signatures  
*    Broadcast the signed transaction  
I am guessing that Phil's need to construct a raw transaction might be to have input coins from wallets owned by different people, and/or to defer broadcast  
If every participant holds a copy of the signed transaction, and they all destroy the keys for the coins being spent, then the only way to spend those coins is to broadcast the signed transaction  
It is not clear why someone would want to defer the broadcast of a transaction. It is not clear what conditions need to be met (or who decides when) to eventually broadcast a deferred transaction. Anybody who holds a copy of the signed transaction can broadcast it any time  
As for destroying private keys to prevent the transaction's inputs being spent, this requires all the participants to trust that the others have destroyed their keys. This is a thin trust thread to rely on for guaranteeing that the deferred payment remains valid to broadcast  
A general point on raw transactions: Wallets are designed to choose coins, calculate fees and change amounts and select change addresses to protect ordinary users from simple catastrophic errors - forgetting change outputs or miscalculating change amounts can cause a raw transaction to send 99% of your Bitcoin balance to miner fees  
USB flash drives are not reliable enough for long term storage of a deferred Bitcoin transaction - or private keys, or seed words, or any other important data

Other issues (does your printer remember your secrets?) are debated here:    
Although that post is titled "pitfalls", the comments include arguments in both directions. Today it is popular to disparage paper wallets - with no nuance - but the actual question is not so clear-cut  
My main objection is the single-address issue, but several discussions have revealed that there are diligent people who keep dozens of keys and addresses on paper and never reuse addresses  
Unfortunately, many of the promoters of paper wallets are also promoters of address reuse  
As for the entropy question - you can create your own entropy by tossing coins or dice, but who has time to do that?

With the default config, bitcoind generates 100 addresses at a time  
This means you only have to backup your wallet again after you have used the 100 addresses in the previous wallet backup  
You can change the number to something more convenient, depending on your usage  
Just remember to back up your wallet when each new block of addresses is generated

Many exchanges do not require ID proof if they do not support buying and selling for fiat currency. Sign up with all those exchanges. Limit your arbitrage trading to them  
Watch out for fees, sometimes trading fees are low, but then an exchange like Binance will ask for 0.0005 BTC to withdraw Bitcoin, or $3.88 to withdraw USDT  
Arbitrage opportunities are small and transient. Don't let a $3 fee wipe out a $2 profit

Never had a failed transaction, have read about failed transactions, and have seen that operators always refund if a system fault took the customer's cash and didn't send the Bitcoin  
Some people are just too stupid to use Bitcoin. The coins are sent to the scanned address, but they have to clue how to use a wallet. The operator has no responsibility to respond to these complaints - beginner handholding is not part of the service  
Most operators fail to disclose pricing, fees and KYC requirements on their Web sites. Sometimes there is price information for individual machines on coinatmradar, but it is nearly always wrong  
Are the operators just too lazy to run a Web page with up-to-the-minute pricing and fees? Or are they relying on the inconvenience - now I'm here I may as well suffer this price - as a way to sucker people into paying whatever markup the operator can get away with  
Big operators like Coinme who operate the Bitcoin selling function of the Coinstar machines deliberately understate fees. They are purposely dishonest  
I've talked to a number of smaller operators about keeping up-to-the-minute prices on their Web pages. This should be simple. Use the same pricing algorithms on the Web pages as are used by the machines' wallet  
**rant**  
Unfortunately, all of them are opportunist entrepreneurs, with technical skills limited to keying a handful of parameters into a setup screen. They hire a Web developer to make one of those hideous brochure-style Web pages, in the modern infinite scrolling design, and never consider that the page should include an algorithm to calculate the current sell price. Their Web developer is a template guy, has no clue how to write 10 lines of PHP script to look up a rate and multiply by a markup rate  
**rant off**  
Boycott any machine if the operator does not have a Web page which automatically displays his current sell price. Contact the operator and tell him this. Most operators have a simple fee model, they just mark up their buy price by a fixed percentage. Some also have a fixed per-transaction fee. Again, if they fail to state all fees on a Web page you can check at home before traveling to the machine, boycott, and contact  
One of the operators here has a Web page (as described above) with a few lines stating their price is 5.5% above the buying price on the 2 largest trading exchanges. It was, but it now higher. Another Web page blunder - the information is outdated and nobody wants to pay a Web developer to change a few words  
It's the lawless, wild, wild west. Prepare before traveling to the machine. Know the current exchange rate before you go. Remember you are not in a hurry to complete the transaction. The machine displays the cash amount you have inserted and the Bitcoin amount it is going to sell you. Your phone has a calculator app. If the price is too high, press the 'refund my cash' button and walk away

Transactions can have many outputs. Don't send dozens of transactions. Send a single transaction with dozens of outputs, for example:  
  
This is also important because it solves the problem of having too many small UTXOs, has lower fees because multiple transactions require higher fees than a single larger transaction, and because fewer UTXOs means fewer inputs, hence smaller transactions and lower fees

Use this paper instead of a phone. Make 4 copies, to protect against paper degradation. Check all 4 copies as frequently as necessary, keeping in mind all the possible causes of paper degradation. Replace any degraded copy immediately. The key to this approach is that it assumes degradation is inevitable and manages this inevitability by using multiple copies, frequent checking and immediate replacement. The "hide and ignore" approach does not cover this risk  
Alternatives to paper - HDD and DVD-R. Again, both of these have failure risks. The same strategy works - multiple copies, frequent checking, immediate replacement

First, my objection to Gmail is that they read all your messages - even if only automatically for choosing targeted advertising  
Aside from this, I have been warned off Gmail by the Petraeus case. He and his lover passed messages to each other by sharing a Gmail account and leaving the messages in "draft" status, never sending them. Google gave the entire mailbox to the FBI  
In all these "how to pass your coins after death" discussions, the optimum solution is usually to trust your lawyer. The password should be sealed in an envelope and stored with the printed Will. The Will should instruct the lawyer or executor to give the envelope to the beneficiaries  
Instead of encryption with a password, there is a different option available for most wallets - the "25th word". You supply your 16-character password as the 25th word when you create your wallet. Then you print the 24 words, and communicate the password separately, just as you would for a phone password or an openssl password. It is safe to print the 24 words, because the wallet can not be restored without having the password as well as the seed words

You could make a chart of unspent outputs by age  
Some will be lost  
and others will belong to hodlers  
There might be a statistical technique to measure what proportion of old unspent outputs are spent each time the exchange rate booms, and then apply a regression formula to get an approximation of how many will eventually be cashed in for profit  
The remainder could be assumed lost

In the context of the thread, **if** a quantum computer ever works reliably enough to discover private keys from EC public keys, then all coins with reused addresses can be stolen. If Bitcoin users continue to reuse addresses, just because they can, whatever their convenience justifications (or the excuse "it's for charity donations"), those people are choosing to have those coins stolen
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:55:34
  
If you spend more than one output from a single CoinJoin in a future transaction, you are linking those coins, de-anonymising them  
If you spend the unequal output amount with one of the equal amounts, then you are linking your new transaction back to your CoinJoin inputs, de-anonymising them even more  
With labels, combined with coin control, you can choose to spend coins from different CoinJoins because the coins from the same CoinJoin all have the same label. Meaningless labels suit this usage

You seem to know the timing, but all your logic ignores the timing  
The ABC group released BCash because they wanted bigger blocks. The did not "remove SegWit", because SegWit was added to Core **after** ABC made their software fork  
Ver had nothing to do with the ABC group, except for one announcement (in August 2017?) that he would put all his support behind BCash if SegWit2X failed. SegWit2X failed in November. Ver switched his support then  
It follows that Ver had nothing to do with the October mining swings, which were primarily the fault of the badly designed BCash difficulty adjustment mechanism - which was then fixed  
Ver probably funded (at least partially) the attempted flippening events in November and December (operation DragonSlayer), trying to switch the majority of mining hash power to BCash. Those failures were very expensive  


Yes, but only **after** SegWit2X was abandoned. Once again, the timing is important. While SegWit2X was alive, all the support was there. After it died, they developed a narrative which included SegWit hate, **because** they switched to supporting BCash. The SegWit hate is a justification for supporting BCash - "BCash is better than Bitcoin because SegWit" followed by a list of the supposed flaws of SegWit  


Paranoid conspiracy bullshit  
There are enough damning facts in this story without inventing this nonsense  
Your analysis would make more sense if you go back a bit further - 2 previous attempts to force larger blocks onto Bitcoin. Those failures motivated the New York agreement - a conspiracy of business interests who did not understand that their personal profit motives did not grant them the power to take over the development of Bitcoin  
The current rhetoric on the BCash side bears the remnants of that failure - if we can't take over Bitcoin, we'll make a new one to replace it. The refusal to add replay protection to SegWit2X because "2X is the main chain and Core is the fork", and all the subsequent claims that BCash is the real Bitcoin (and the failed, hijacked Satoshi's Vision rhetoric). These claims are all based in the New York group's desire to control Bitcoin because their money interest gives them that right  
The Bitmain story is a simple tale of business failure. Yes, Bitmain held some BCash, which fell in value. But those amounts are insignificant in the main story of Bitmain's failure. Bitmain is not innocent - they participated in the flippening incidents, and lost money doing so  
But the real story of the Bitmain financial losses and IPO failure is just a boring story of mismanagement of a startup - failure to manage insufficient supply in a market of growing demand, followed by overproduction just when the demand fell. In hindsight this was predictable, this exact pattern is taught to business students as "The Beer Game"  
Technical  


Not really. They were forking a new chain with an unpredictable amount of hash power. It is justifiable to modify the difficulty to match the actual hash rate, instead of inheriting the Bitcoin difficulty number. Given that they got it so badly wrong, they should have left it, and just put up with a few weeks of slow confirmation times, but that's just hindsight

You don't want to do this, because you have no control over the Bitcoin purchase part of the transaction. If the customer says he paid at the Bitcoin site, and you didn't get the Bitcoin, then you tell him he has to resolve the problem with the Bitcoin site. This looks bad for you  


This sentence makes no sense. Is there a missing?  
Changelly now requires ID proof, because they are subject to government regulation. There are places your customers can buy Bitcoin without ID, but not with credit cards, and only in some countries  
For example, bity.com in Switzerland and Europe  
Also, a friend uses a similar approach for accepting donations for his small non-profit. The donor visits his local Bitcoin ATM, scans the non-profit's Bitcoin address QR at the ATM, inserts cash, donation sent. This has the same disadvantage as mentioned above. If the Bitcoin doesn't arrive, the donor has to negotiate a refund from the ATM operator  
It is much safer, less contentious, for the customer to set up a Bitcoin wallet, buy Bitcoin into his own wallet, then send you Bitcoin

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

This works well for donations, where the exact amount is not important. Read the other comments for the customer support issues caused by inexact payment amounts. The ATM calculates the Bitcoin amount according to the currency notes you feed it, which makes it impossible to exactly match the merchant's invoice amount  
There are other potential issues. If the ATM fails to send, you have to resolve the problem with the ATM operator, but you didn't use your own Bitcoin receiving address, which can make the problem resolution more complicated

Tether exists on a promise of being able to redeem every USD Tether for USD1, on demand  
The promise **was** backed by a claim that every USD Tether was covered by USD1 of fiat on deposit in a bank account, proven by regular audit  
A huge amount of USD Tether was issued without USD backing. The auditor was asked to cover this up by falsifying the audit. The auditor quit and was not replaced  
If there is a run on Tether redemption requests, then redemption payments will be delayed to avoid depleting the fiat deposits. This will accelerate the run. Redemptions will be suspended for a time. When redemptions resume, they will be fixed at a rate less than USD1. The rate will reflect the actual amount of fiat on deposit in proportion to the amount of unredeemed USD Tether. Tether holders suffer losses. Tether turns out not to be stable. People stop using Tether. Lawsuits abound. Life goes on

This one is false, and logically incompatible with point   
The main fallacy in your scenario is the "all-or-nothing" nature of your assumption. The reality is that the system works with few miners just as well as it works with many miners. Predicting zero miners makes no sense  
The other fallacy is that mining requires financial reward. This is contradicted by the fact that Bitcoin was mined (one block per 10 minutes) for several years with a block reward equal to a few pennies. Miners in those years were motivated by altruism. Altruism is the normal incentive for participating in Bitcoin. The current billion dollar industry of overpowered ASIC devices is a temporary aberration

Wrong question, see the other comments about pool mining. A miner in a pool can profit with a single device, without ever mining a single block  
The literal answer to your question - how can a non-pool miner produce blocks - is simple arithmetic. Arithmetic works better with a precise question. Your wording "realistic and regular" is not precise. Can I interpret "regular" as one block per year, average?  
This subreddit occasionally discusses the minimum hashrate required to set up a new, small pool. If the requirement is to produce one block per week, then the required pool hash rate is the current global hash rate divided by the number of blocks produced in a week  
    55 million Terahash per second / 1008 = 54563 Terahash / second  
An Antminer S9 hashes 14 Terahash per second, so you would need about 4000 of them to produce 1 block per week

This relates to the IMF document published in June 2018  
  
This document discusses cryptocurrency, and then proceeds to differentiate permissioned from permissionless. Bitcoin is permissionless and this is dangerous, according to the IMF  
The thrust of the IMF approach to cryptocurrency is to cherry pick the "good" parts, and discard the rest. So they think they can make a Blockchain which is centrally controlled, and get all the benefits of Bitcoin, without the "danger" of Bitcoin having no central control  
Because they are bureaucrats, they rename the technology "Distributed Ledger Technology" - look at this clever new jargon phrase we invented!  
That's the answer to the "distributed ledger" part of the question. It's just a Bitcoin-like blockchain currency, after discarding all the inconvenient parts

Bullshit  
Vinnik was not accused of laundering Mt Gox lost or stolen coins  
He was accused of not requiring ID from his customers, attracting customers who used his exchange to launder their own criminal funds  
Alexander Vinnik has been charged with various crimes in at least 3 countries. He has never been charged with stealing funds from Mt Gox  
Mt Gox lost Bitcoins through their own fraud and incompetence. They were arbitrage trading with their own customers' Bitcoins, and were caught with a large amount of Bitcoins on the wrong side of a trade when the price moved too far in the wrong direction. These losses were covered up. Mt Gox attempted to trade out of the losses, and made the problem worse  
In order to get favourable treatment from USA law enforcement Mark Karpeles agreed with USA authorities to spread the rumour that Vinnik stole Mt Gox Bitcoins, because Vinnik was refusing to comply with know-your-customer regulations

Not so simple  
All the data in every block is verified against tampering using internal hashes. Modifying a single transaction will invalidate the transaction hash. Changing a transaction hash will invalidate the block hash. All the blocks are chained together by storing the block hash in the subsequent block, all the way back to the genesis block  
The smallest change breaks the chain  
Breaking the chain by removing unwanted data makes the chain vulnerable to malicious alteration, a fraud risk which would make Bitcoin useless

Approximately 5 million bitcoins were mined before the end of 2010, but they were widely distributed. Finding 600k for one purchase would be nearly impossible  
He's right, Bicoin did not have a price. The pizza story is evidence of that  
If you decided to be that guy who wants to corner the Bitcoin market by buying all the available coins for a fraction of a cent, your buying behaviour would establish a marketplace, and the price would quickly increase, preventing you from buying 600k bitcoins for $2500  
This happened in 2011 - Silk Road, media publicity about Silk Road, the growth of Mt Gox, price spike to $35, then back to $3

Profitable? It depends how long you think your mining equipment will last. If you want it to pay back the purchase price in 8 months, then it's not profitable  


That assumption makes no sense. If mining becomes unprofitable, miners will leave, the hash rate will decrease and the difficulty will fall  
No sign of the hash rate decreasing so far, therefore the miners are not leaving, so they must be optimistic. Either they believe the price will increase, or they think their equipment will keep creating a few dollars per day for 2 years, or they're waiting for everyone else to leave first

You're looking for precise definitions of things which do not have precise definitions, they are just buzz words  
"Consensus algorithm", in particular, is ambiguous and meaningless. Its most common use is to refer to the mining hashing algorithm as Bitcoin's consensus algorithm, because mining is part of the consensus process. This usage is based on a false belief that mining is the most important component of the consensus process. It is not  
It does not matter what a thing is called, it only matters what it does, how it works  
Consensus is code running on nodes  
All nodes must have code which follows the same consensus rules - but it does not have to be identical code  
A smart contract is code which is stored in a transaction, and then executed by all the nodes as they process the transaction. This violates a major principle of software development - never execute code embedded in externally supplied data. It is an attack vector. This has no future

You have this the wrong way around  
You do not need to identify the customer by their address  
Your wallet has thousands of addresses. It creates a new address every time someone makes an order. Bitcoin addresses are designed to be used only once  
When your customer makes an order, your wallet creates a new address, your invoicing software tags the invoice with the address. When the payment arrives, the receiving address of the payment tells you exactly which invoice it is paying

You can create a transaction which confirms years later  
I created one recently which confirmed after 23 days  
Fee was 2300 Satoshi, when everybody else was paying $25  
I created the transaction with coinb.in and injected it to the network using the pushtx service at blockchain.info  
No, you cannot reverse it. It could exist on someone's computer, or mempool backup, and be re-injected to the node network weeks later, or even years later, just for laughs  
To prevent this, you have to submit a double spend, a transaction which spends at least one of the inputs in your original transaction. If the double spend gets confirmed in a block, then the original transaction can never be confirmed  
No matter how cheap your fee is, you cannot predict that it will never be confirmed. A few weeks ago, low-fee transactions were being confirmed almost immediately. Then somebody or somebodies took the opportunity to consolidate a lot of dust, for weeks keeping the mempool between 4000 and 8000, as if they were deliberately releasing transactions at just the right rate to avoid congestion, but never let the mempool empty  
At that time, 1 Sat/byte was too low, but a lot of transactions with fee 1.3 Sat/byte were getting confirmed. My 1 Sat/byte tx disappeared from mempools, then after 6 days it magically reappeared in a block, as if it was a new transaction, instantly confirmed  
Unconfirmed transactions do not expire. You can only prevent one being confirmed by submitting a new transaction to replace it. This can be frustrating if the replacement does not confirm

As already discussed 4 days ago  
This link for my convenience:   


Arguably, you can prove the current state correct just by downloading the block headers and verifying the prev hash in each header  
But that's not the issue here  
The issue is how much data has to be processed to initialise a new node, and the answer is "all of it"  
Verifying the blockchain is only part of the initialisation of a new node. In fact, since Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 (March 2017), new nodes have a default setting in the "assumevalid" config variable which causes the new node to only validate the most recent few thousand blocks  
So, if we're no longer validating the whole chain on a new node, why does it need to process the whole chain when initialising? Because that's the only way to build the UTXO database  
If you want, you can download the UTXO database from someone else. But then you would need to trust that person. Bitcoin's principle is "verify, don't trust". Last I looked, you could get the entire Blockchain, and chainstate (including UTXO database) from here:  
  
  
  
There were other places with pruned Blockchains, but I'm not sure they're still maintained. In any case, downloading the full chain is fast enough, it's only 210GB  
But do you use the UTXO database supplied here, or do you spend the time building one for yourself? Trust the download site, or verify and wait a few hours or a few days?  


This discussion again. There's a false dichotomy in the block size debate - the belief that 1MB Bitcoin blocks are small, and scaling requires them to be bigger. The technical debate is different, but mostly ignored. For "anybody" to run a node - millions of nodes, not tens of thousands of nodes - the block size should probably be 200k or 300k. The real debate is, what prevents reducing the block size to 300k? Unfortunately, the answer is obvious, you can't unscramble an egg  
My opinions about transaction pruning and sort/merge processing to accelerate node initialisation are in the earlier thread  


Not familiar with Stellar, but this is the point about initialisation time. If you don't prune spent transactions, then you have to process all the spent transaction outputs twice when building the UTXO database. Add every output to the UTXO database as you traverse the Blockchain, then remove the spent ones when you discover the spending input later. If the spent transactions are permanently pruned, then the UTXO build goes much faster. Also see my sort/merge suggestion in the earlier thread. It would run better if the Blockchain is smaller, and transaction pruning makes it smaller  
Block size and RAM footprints are a bit imprecise. Three years ago, there was a concern that a lot of nodes would quit if the RAM requirement increased from 2GB to 8GB. It's not about the price of RAM. It's about how many nodes are using a motherboard with a 4GB maximum. The node operator gets to choose between replacing the PC and retiring the node. Three years later, this is less of an issue  
And if the block size was 300k, the Blockchain 10GB, then you could have millions of nodes running on phones and tablets - just a thought  
How many nodes does Bitcoin need?  
*    At least 2  
*    As many as possible, preferably millions  


Going off-track a bit here. A few weeks ago, I inherited a 2011 HP Mini notebook which is too slow to run Windows - 1GB RAM, 250GB HDD - so I installed Raspbian Linux on it. I'm upgrading the RAM to 2GB and the HDD to 500GB, then commissioning it as a node. It should be OK. But if the Bitcoin node RAM requirement was more than 2GB, bad luck  
Do we want to have outdated, throwaway notebooks running nodes? Or Raspberry Pi nodes for that matter. They're limited to 1GB RAM, but people run them anyway.

This discussion is deeper than "my software doesn't do those things that Javascript app does therefore my software is secure"  
I agree that the NPM mechanism for downloading dependent libraries is less safe that various other mechanisms  
But your mechanism is also encumbered by blind trust, even if it is less vulnerable than the NPM repository. You do not know the provenance of all your dependent libraries. Qualitatively you have the same risk  
I am not advocating that developers should write all their own library functions and never import external libraries, although I did read that suggestion in another forum yesterday  
I am not advocating the Microsoft/Apple approach of only permitting users to install apps which have been signed by approved developers. This "walled garden" approach to avoiding malware makes those platforms almost inaccessible to many developers. It is also flawed, because it creates a malware vector via the loose certificate management procedures on those platforms  
I don't know the solution. I just want to see more honest discussion about the breadth of the issue. I do not want to read unjustifiable claims that "our app is safe because we don't use that NPM repository which was compromised"

I see the BCash fanboys using this too. It's an excuse. Decentralisation is not a primary feature of Bitcoin. Decentralisation is 100% necessary, no compromises, to prevent transaction censorship. Resistance against transaction censorship is Bitcoin's primary purpose  
Compromising decentralisation means allowing transaction censorship  
Without resistance against transaction censorship, Bitcoin has no reason to exist  


Too complex  


Step back a bit. Look at the original use case for Bitcoin - online shopping. Look at other practical use cases - international remittance, capital flight. Remove the unproductive "use case", speculation. What's left is a few small niches. In this context, Bitcoin is great. It works, up to its scaling limit. If it reaches this limit - when blocks fill up - make a second one. After a few years, the second one fills too. Eventually, Bitcoin is just one of many similar cryptocurrencies, not competing to be the One True Bitcoin, sharing the transaction volume  
Each new Blockchain is an opportunity to improve - smaller blocks, lower RAM footprint, fast node initialisation. Multiple independent chains drives innovation - multi-chain wallets, atomic swaps between separate chains

Guesswork  




The experience of using Bitcoin with 1MB blocks shows they are probably too big. There are thousands of Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin would be more secure if there were millions of nodes  
In hindsight, 300k blocks might be optimum - see the other comment in this thread  
Unfortunately, reducing block size  from 1MB to 300k would be like unscrambling an egg. The disruption would be greater than the benefit  
If you were starting from scratch, coding a new coin, and you wanted to define your new coin based on what Bitcoin might have been if we knew what we know now, then 100k block size could be a good starting point

You have to backup the Core wallet because it contains your seed key, and because there is no official method for restoring a Core wallet from the seed key alone  
Some other wallets use a 12-word "seed phrase" to derive the seed key, and you can restore the wallet just by entering the 12 words. Backing up the wallet is not required. Backing up the seed phrase is essential  
It is possible to restore a Core wallet just from the seed key, but you would have to use unofficial tools. It is simpler just to backup the wallet  
Other things  
Wallets have many keys  
A seed phrase is not a key  
Backing up keys (non-deterministic wallets) carries a risk of loss because many people are not careful enough to backup frequently, and find their latest backup is too old to contain their latest keys. For obvious reasons, the greatest value is nearly always on the most recent keys. Old backups cause substantial losses

It's not new. The fake Elon Musk Twitter "send me Bitcoin" scam has been running for months. Your post is a nearly exact copy of about 40 others in this subreddit  
The lesson is that a "giveaway" which asks for a payment in advance is not a giveaway. It is nothing more than the same old [Advance Fee Fraud]( which has been common for decades  
About 25 years ago, I was having lunch in a bar. There was a fish bowl on the bar - "Drop your business card in the bowl to win a prize". I discovered a few months later that the contact details on the fish bowl cards were being sold. I received a snail mail from Nigeria  
paraphrased  


I showed the letter to my accountant. She had seen dozens of them. She explained that the Nigerians rely on greed - the 3 million dollar offer - to trap the victim into a cycle of advance fee payments. It starts with a request for a few thousand as a "facilitation payment" or bribe, to a co-conspirator in the Nigerian's bank. Please send by Western Union. The victim weighs the few thousand as a small inconvenience in comparison to the eventual multi-million reward. Some victims are so convinced they're going to get rich that they keep making these advance payments for 2 years, as much as $500k in total, before realising they've been defrauded  
Variations: an unexpected lottery win (clue: you didn't buy a lottery ticket), an unexpected inheritance, variations on the "please help me launder $15m", and more recently, promises of undying love  
1. if it's too good to be true, it's fake  
1. if a prize or giveaway requires an advance payment, then there is no prize

Make it illegal to run Bitcoin nodes. Some nodes shut down, some go underground, and most keep running because there is no world-wide jurisdiction  
Bitcoin is innovation. Imagine a scenario where all the major population countries - China, India, etc - and all the major economic countries - USA, Europe - ban Bitcoin, and their people comply with the ban.

Pruning is not transaction pruning  
Transaction pruning is  Section 7 Reclaiming Disk Space. This has never been implemented. The current pruning method requires some nodes to carry the entire transaction history, and requires pruning nodes to download the entire transaction history, build indexes, while deleting most of the blocks  


Why can't we run nodes which only contain the UTXO database?  
Why can't we run nodes which use a block explorer API to look up transactions as they're needed?  
You could do these things, even modify Core so that it serves blocks and transactions remotely on request  
You can't do this, until you develop the software to do it

If you think these patents are related to Blockchain, then you have no clue what a Blockchain is  
As for the patents themselves, they appear to be minor enhancements to Bittorrent or Usenet methods of splitting files into small chunks for long-term storage and/or transmission  
All they're adding is  
* storage of the individual pieces in so-called "cloud storage"  
* encryption as a "hide in plain sight" technique  
* indexing the chunks in a method similar to a Usenet NZB file, using the specific cloud location of each chunk, in the way a NZB file contains the Usenet Message-ID of every chunk    
If I was the patent examiner these would fail the requirement for an invention to be non-obvious. They are obvious trivial extensions of established techniques

There's no correlation  
The hash rate increased for the whole period. The price flopped up and down a bit
The hash rate increased for the period of the graph because of the supply constraints in the ASIC miner marketplace, the Bitmain monopoly has a permanent supply shortage and delivery delay. The chart begins exactly when a new batch of Bitmain Antminer S9s began to be delivered  
This graph could be more interesting in a few months, if the price continues to fall. The price fall should eventually cause some miners to give up, causing the hash rate to fall. There will be a delay  
A chart which measures the delay between price fall and hash rate fall, and the price at which the hash rate fall is triggered, will be informative

bind is for specifying which network interface you want your node to use for communications between your node and other nodes  
Many networked applications have a similar option. Most people don't need to use it, because most computers are only connected to a single network  
In the medium term, this will change. As more and more people connect to the Internet through VPN services, some computer users will want to split their traffic between the VPN interface and the ISP interface, or between 2 or more VPN interfaces.

Price and delivery schedule are on the product Web site  


Yes, risky  
The risk is offset by the supply problem. The demand is so high that if you order an Antminer, pay for it, wait for delivery, and then it's not profitable, there's a resale market which will pay higher that retail to avoid waiting for the manufacturer's next delivery date. But if it's seriously unprofitable - if the Bitcoin price falls suddenly to under $2000 - the resale market will dry up too

This is just something I heard from a friend. I'm not in this field  
Years ago, people wanting to sign up for hundreds of accounts on membership-based Web sites realised it would be faster to write a few lines of scripted code (signup bot) to automatically create accounts. To combat this practice, CAPTCHA was invented because it requires a human at the keyboard for every signup. Now, CAPTCHA is standard practice all over the Web  
There are money reasons for wanting hundreds of throwaway accounts on various sites  
Not to be defeated, the bot scripters devised a way to automate the non-CAPTCHA parts of their signups, and divert the CAPTCHA to pay-per-CAPTCHA human workers. This is a compromise which allows the bot signups to work for a small cost, as long as that cost is justifiable. That is, if there is $5 value in a throwaway yahoomail account, then paying 50 cents to a CAPTCHA solver is good business  
Why would there be $5 value in a throwaway yahoomail account?

This comment is entirely fictional  
I made up this story as an amusing counterpoint to the stupid suggestion that somehow mining is less wasteful if it uses renewable energy, the brainless preconception that electricity supply is unlimited and everybody can choose their energy source with no impact on the rest of the energy economy  
The inspiration is from a very old suggestion I once read on halfbakery.com, that pedestrian traffic at bus stops might be harvested for electricity using pressure-sensitive generators on the sidewalk. Credit also to the Tokyo train station which actually generates enough power from foot traffic to run the ticket gates. And episode 2 of Black Mirror, thank you Charlie Brooker:

Stuck in your wallet, for a few days, maybe, depending on your wallet, and using a different wallet like coinb.in (offline) can circumvent your wallet's restriction  
Stuck in most nodes' mempools for up to 14 days, often only 2-3 days  
Some chance that your transaction will be re-broadcast to stop it expiring from mempools  
Most commonly, after 3 days, most mempools will discard your unconfirmed transaction, then you should send those bitcoins to yourself to prevent random players from re-broadcasting your unconfirmed transaction - or re-send the original transaction yourself, possibly with a higher fee

Lots of words for little purpose  
The first page of the white paper is clear about the merchant chargeback problem caused by the interference of third parties - so-called "trusted" transaction brokers like Visa  
All the nonsense about libertarianism and all your attempts and Hedl's attempts to infer "between-the-lines" motivations are pointless  
The USA banned online casinos. USA online gamblers defrauded casinos by using chargebacks to recoup their gambling losses - legally  
Bitcoin is a cash analogue for online transactions, defeats the "legalised fraud" opportunity caused by regulatory interference in commerce, and the related "trusted party" (Visa, and similar) obligation to rule in favour of the customer and pillage the merchant  
Bitcoin is a store of value, for about an hour, the time it takes for a customer to acquire a small amount of Bitcoin and spend it, then for the merchant to convert it back to fiat

BCash is not Roger's coin, obvious just by reading the history  
The Bitcoin ABC group released BCash in August 2017  
At the time, Bitmain and Roger Ver were promoting a different planned fork, a 2x block size increase on the SegWit version of Bitcoin  
Roger Ver made a public statement in August (I think) that he would throw all his resources and support behind BCash if BitcoinSegWit2X failed. The rest of the history is that the supporters of 2X withdrew support a few weeks before live date, and began promoting BCash very heavily in October 2017  
As for developer decision-making in the ABC group, I don't follow their Github, but I understand their discussions are public and transparent  
Please do not use the word "consensus" for software development  
Consensus in the Bitcoin context is the compatibility of software the node operators choose to use, which is controlled by the node operators, not the Core developer team  


I think you're right. That was a Bitmain threat, not a conspiracy. The attempt to sabotage the SegWit UASF had no impact. Bitmain was probably bluffing, and/or did not have the resources to implement the threat

The space in between has a range from $1.00 to $3.00, using the "main use case" method  
Bitcoin is a currency for buying things online, where  the merchant or the customer  
*    has no access to the centralised payment services, or  
*    has reasons not to use the centralised payment services  
The customer decides to make a purchase, finds the merchant's Bitcoin price, acquires that amount of Bitcoin, spends it, then the merchant converts the Bitcoin to fiat at the end of the day  
The time between the customer acquiring Bitcoin with fiat, and the merchant converting the same Bitcoin to fiat is what defines the demand. Let's say this time is 1 day, average  
There are about 300,000 Bitcoin transactions per day, and the average Bitcoin transaction is about $60  
There are approximately 10 million Bitcoin liquid enough to service this daily buy, spend, sell cycle  
Enter this into a calculator  
300000*60 / 10000000 = $1.80 per Bitcoin

There is an advantage to the payment processor and to the merchant  
The payment protocol encapsulates the merchant's receiving address, the transaction amount, and the fee. This reduces manual handling of cases where purchasers send transactions with incorrect details  
*    It is expensive for the merchant or payment processor to negotiate a short payment from the purchaser  
*    The purchaser can not accidentally send to the wrong address  
*    The payment processor can choose the transaction fee, avoiding confirmation delays

Block size is all about the RAM requirements of a node  
There were some predictions that doubling the RAM requirement would cut the number of nodes by 90%  
Disk space will not be an issue for 10 years or more  
200GB retail price is less than $10  
except, see "elephant" below ...  
The disk space issue was addressed by the pruning method developed a few years ago, an unfortunate sidetrack in my opinion  
**The elephant in the room**  
The real issue is not disk space, because the smallest HDD size on a new PC is now 2TB, and most new computers have 4TB or more. The main barrier to setting up a new node is the time it takes to initialise the Blockchain. There is no time saved by choosing to prune  
Depending on the CPU power of the computer, it takes hours, or days, or weeks to initialise the Blockchain on a new node. Several days is the most common experience. A few hours is possible on a machine with an expensive CPU. A Raspberry Pi will take 5 weeks or more  
It is possible to rewrite the Blockchain initialisation as a series of sequential processing steps - sort merge sort merge etc. Written well, removing all direct disk access, sequential processing is thousands of times faster because it benefits from blocking and caching features of hard disks. A physical disk block contains hundreds, or thousands of logical records. If these are all being processed in order, the physical disk reads are reduced to one read per block. Even a Raspberry Pi could initialise the current Blockchain in maybe 10 hours  
**What's the catch?**  
A series of "sort merge" steps requires a minimum of 2 (most likely 4) full copies of the Blockchain on disk, preferably on 2 separate disks, during the process. A 200GB Blockchain requires 800GB of space to initialise, and chain size starts to become an issue  
**The solution?**  
Go back to the white paper, and implement transaction pruning with Merkle hashes  
The Blockchain size falls to less than 20GB  
Now implement sort/merge initialisation  
Blockchain initialisation runs in 5 minutes  
Anybody can run a node  
**What's the catch?**  
There is a lot of resistance to transaction pruning  
A pruned node will not have full transaction history, because Bitcoin consensus only needs enough history to verify the UTXOs being spent by new transactions. Fully spent transactions have no consensus role  
However, most Bitcoin people believe full transaction history is essential, back to the genesis block

The article you quoted was written by people who do not understand how Bitcoin mining works  
The article was thoroughly refuted in this subreddit when it was published  
The entire argument relies on the fallacy that hash power is controlled by the mining pools  
Hash power is controlled by individual miners, who can choose to join a different pool at any time  
There is no centralisation  
There are too few pools  
Most pools do not allow members to choose the transactions to included in their blocks. This will change, slowly  
Mining will decentralise naturally when the speculator price bubble bursts and Bitcoin returns to it's sane value - approximately $1

That's all true  
There is a general view among wallet developers - don't ask how the sausage is made. This is why incompatibilities exist. Your questions are challenging this. You want to know how the sausage is made. No really, don't ask how the sausage is made. Never try to import keys from one wallet into another wallet. It's dangerous, you will lose your bitcoins. If you want to use different wallets, each one has its own keys and you **must** use the sweep function to move funds from wallet to wallet. That way, each of your wallets has its own keys and you have a nice neat on-chain transaction spending from one wallet to another and the only funds you lose are a small transaction fee  
I don't agree with the above, except that if you're accident-prone, trigger-happy on the delete button, you will lose bitcoins every time you "accidentally" delete a wallet with bitcoins in it. Your choice, you've been warned  
Your choice is HD or non-HD  
If you choose HD, you have to backup the word list, and have software which recreates the key list - Bitcoin wallets have hundreds of keys, not one private key  
Software like this -&gt;   
This is free and open source, so it's future-proof  
The wrinkles are there on the page: BIP39 is flexible, there are options. Which derivation path does my wallet use? What does that mean?  
It's not as hard as it looks, but try finding a list of which BIP39 derivation paths are used for all the BIP39 HD wallets, and then see if the iancoleman page creates the same key list as each of the different wallets creates. This will eat into your spare time  
The Core HD wallet is BIP32, no word list, more wrinkles  
Non-HD  
Not popular, fewer and fewer wallets are allowing this option  
But, even some wallets which are superficially HD-only will allow you to import a private key from outside. So you can be non-HD by ignoring the HD keys and addresses, import all the keys you want to use, and keep a backup of those keys. Some wallets do not allow importing keys. Do not use these wallets  
The non-HD choice requires you to backup all your private keys. This is future-proof, because you don't even need to keep a working copy of software for the future. It's risky. Remember that HD wallets were invented for a reason, to solve the problem of users failing to backup their wallets. With HD, all the keys can be derived from the word list, so you create a safe copy of the word list when you start, and keep it forever. With non-HD, there is no relationship between the keys, so you need to be sure that all your keys, including the new ones you created yesterday, have a good backup. In this mode, be aware that **your newer keys are more likely to have more money on them**, so it's unforgivable to procrastinate the backups  
Now the good news. A Bitcoin private key is only 32 bytes long, so you could fit a billion of them on a DVD-R and still have space left over. To avoid the inconvenience of more and more backups, create a million or more keys at the start, put them in a file, encrypt the file with AES128 or 7zip, and burn several DVD-R disks. Check the disks every 3 months. Replace any disk which becomes unreadable. Do not forget the encryption passphrase  


Not really  
There are only 3 formats which matter  
* raw  
* hex  
* WIF, encoded in base58check format  
Raw is binary, 32 bytes, easiest for making backups, standard format for most random generators  
Hex is "human-readable", 64 bytes, useful for input into multi-format conversion tools if they can't read "raw"  
WIF-base58check is the normal format for importing into a wallet  
Does it matter?  
What is a private key?  
A private key is any string of 256 bits (except for values above FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140)  
I don't use wallet software to make my non-HD keys. I make them with other tools, then import them into Electrum or coinb.in or other wallets as required. Wallets do not do anything special to make keys. A private key is nothing more than a string of '0' and '1' values, 256 bits long. You don't want your keys to be guessable, so they should be random. Let's make a million keys  
    openssl rand 32000000 &gt; one.million.keys.bin  
32 million bytes is one million keys. Encrypt, burn to DVD-R, never forget the decryption passphrase. You're set for life  
This keyset is "raw" format  
To convert to any format, I use bitcoin-tool  
  
Note the warnings on that Git page, don't ask how the sausage is made  
Now we have a million private keys in raw binary format, carefully backed up on multiple DVD-R and encrypted, and we have free, open source software to convert from raw to all the other formats. Most commonly, I convert to WIF-base58check and import into Electrum. I usually only import the keys I need for each transaction. I do not maintain a permanent wallet. The encrypted million key backup is my permanent wallet. It contains only private keys, in the simplest raw format  
All your questions answered?  
You should seriously consider the "don't ask how the sausage is made" advice, use HD wallets, and keep a safe backup of seed words for each wallet you use. Sweep from wallet to wallet when required. You're much less likely to accidentally delete a valuable private key

Fossil oil is directly replaceable with synthetic oil  
Carbon dioxide + superheated steam using a catalyst such as titanium, cobalt or gallium -&gt; methane  
At laboratory scale, using titanium oxide, the conversion rate is about 4%  
Existing industrial techniques have been used for nearly a century to synthesize longer chain hydrocarbons and liquid carbohydrates from methane - propane, butane, isooctane, cetane, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether - all direct replacements for existing fossil fuels burnt in spark engines and compression ignition engines  
Using lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight heats water into superheated steam  
The rest of the problem is the engineering required to build world-supply scale fuel synthesis plants, hundreds of square kilometres of fuel refinery megafactories on the world's largest coastal deserts, pumping seawater, extracting carbon dioxide, superheating steam, converting to methane 4% per cycle, then converting methane to other fuels according to world requirements  
The only thing preventing this is price. Fossil oil is too cheap, inhibiting the investment required to begin building the synthetic oil replacement  
The question is not whether we can replace oil. The question is whether we can survive the transition (and economic disruption) from stupidly cheap fossil oil to expensive, never-ending renewable synthetic oil

Bitcoin is not a revolution, it simply fills a gap in the online transactions infrastructure - provides a cash analogue for online transactions, in cases where third party payment providers - credit cards, PayPal - are not available (or not desirable) to the transaction participants

Mimblewimble might help, partially  
It doesn't store keys or addresses on its Blockchain, only obfuscated inputs, obfuscated outputs and signatures  
But Mimblewimble works by signing with a private key and verifying signature with a public key, just as Bitcoin does, but keeps the transaction private between the parties - so, exposing your private key means losing your coins

The article has a half-reasonable answer to this  
Russian oil and gas contracts are priced in USD  
After the Skripal murders in Britain, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia. The sanctions restrict Russia's oil and gas trade, or maybe the sanctions prevent them spending their USD oil and gas revenues
From here everything becomes illogical ...  
To circumvent the sanctions Russia will sell oil and gas for a currency other than USD  
or maybe they want to convert their USD to Bitcoin  
But they can't buy Bitcoin for USD  
So the story invents a magic intermediate cryptocurrency  
which can be used to buy Bitcoin - presumably on Binance

The static IP needs to be the LAN address on the PC running the node. Set this in the PC, not the router  
Port forwarding has to be done using the router which connects your LAN to the Internet. It is a simple function in the router's Web pages. See  for instructions for hundreds of different router models  


When my node has a new transaction to send to your node, it knows your node's public IP address, which is the address of your router. Your node is not running on your router, it is running on a PC on your LAN. Port forwarding tells the router to let my node send messages to your node  
My node has a new transaction. It sends the transaction to your public IP address at port 8333. Your router receives the message about this new transaction. If you port forward, then your router is able to pass the new transaction into your node  
If you don't port forward, then your router just refuses my node's messages. Your node is blind to the world

1. Not sure you could run a Bitcoin selling business if you are completely unbanked. That's a lot of cash (probably uninsurable) to keep on premises. Then you have to find a seller to accept cash to replenish your Bitcoin supply. All the trading exchanges and OTC sellers require you to fund your exchange account via a bank account  
2. Review the historical prosecutions of Bitcoin sellers. They are almost all investigated by Federal Agents and prosecuted under Federal law. The Agent has no obligation to audit. He responds to an advertisement in a local newspaper, or on localbitcoins.com - usually chooses the biggest localbitcoins.com seller in his region. He meets the seller, buys Bitcoin.

The specifics of the mathematics are in the academic paper  
  


If the nonces are the same, then there is a simple formula which can calculate the private key from the 2 signatures and the 2 messages that were signed  


Where the nonces are different, but similar because they have common prefixes or common suffixes, there is a mathematical technique which is similar to brute force trial and error, but requires a much lower number of trial and error calculations to expose the private key  
Instead of waiting 1000 years for a raw brute force trial and error loop to find a single private key, the method used by the researchers found 300 private keys in about a month

The Pi runs a Broadcom system-on-a-chip  
For reasons of protecting technical secrets, some of the firmware required to interface an operating system with the SoaC - to access to GPU, USB, etc - are supplied by Broadcom in binary form only  
This is analogous to the problem of many devices in production today - especially WiFi controllers, but also printers and other components and peripherals. The manufacturer refuses to supply driver source code and refuses to supply specifications for free software developers to develop free drivers  
The DMCA prohibition on reverse-engineering is a huge aggravating factor, because it has a chilling effect, preventing USA driver developers from working on free drivers for many components. Serious criminal penalties apply. Fortunately, few other countries have such isolationist laws, reverse engineering is legal outside the USA  
Secret binary drivers and boot loaders - UEFI motherboards, most phones and tablets. It's almost impossible to buy a laptop which is able to operate with free device drivers  
In many senses, the Pi is at the low end of this problem. You could argue that the secret firmware, because it is designed to protect technology secrets, can be seen as part of the hardware. The manufacturer publishes a free specification for device drivers to interface with the firmware, which is no different to a driver specification for a hardware component without inter-firmware. The FSF doesn't agree with this. If I was picking sides, I'll pick the FSF argument

No, it varies over time, according to the unpredictable creation of new transactions spending old TXOs

It is possible to prune transactions from old blocks if the transactions are fully spent. The White Paper describes a method for this. This pruning method is the main reason for calculating the transactions-hash in the block header as the root hash of a Merkle tree. Details in the "Reclaiming Disk Space" section of the white paper  
The Merkle tree allows transactions to be replaced by their hashes, and adjacent pairs of transaction hashes to be replaced by their Merkle hash, and so on up the Merkle tree. This allows for the calculation of the Merkle root hash to remain accurate, even after removing transactions. The Blockchain can still be validated

Zero  


Fees will be zero. Miners do not charge fees. Transaction senders choose how much fee to pay. In 120 years time, every Bitcoin user will choose to pay zero transaction fees  


In 2009, 2010, 2011, Bitcoin mining was a penny hobby. Then it gradually became dominated by greedy miners. Greedy miners will retire. Altruistic miners will continue to mine Bitcoin without financial incentive  


Bitcoin software automatically adjusts Bitcoin mining so that it creates 1 block every 10 minutes. In 2009 there were only a handful of miners. In 2150, there might be only a few thousand miners. Bitcoin will still create one new block of transactions every 10 minutes, the same as it always has  


The same questions are asked here about 100 times every week

*    Compared to the White Paper, the biggest change is that mining moved from "everybody has a node and every node is a miner" to a multi-billion business  
*    Because Section 7 Reclaiming Disk Space (pruning fully spent transactions) was never implemented, node initialisation takes longer and longer, deterring many users from attempting to run a node  
*    Invasion of the speculators, the scammers pumping the price of a 2-cent token as high as $19,800, with all their price pump trigger words - adoption, store of value, digital gold, regulation

If you use a USB flash drive to store important data, you will lose it  
Flash ROM is subject to instant and complete failure  
Encrypt the seed wordlist with AES-128 and a strong passphrase, make 1000 copies, burn the 1000 copies to 4 DVD-R and store them in safe places. Memorise the AES passphrase  
Then, more important ...  
Check every backup frequently  
Nothing lasts forever, so if you verify the integrity of your backups, and one of them fails, then you can replace it with one of the good copies  
Paper copies are almost as good as DVD-R, apart from being subject to insect attack, moisture damage and fungal growth. As with DVD, the important part is to check the backups frequently, and replace any damaged paper with a fresh copy

Not known, not within the scope of the study  
Wild guess: Bitcoin exchanges might account for some of this problem, using software developed internally and not published  


The point is that most operating systems come with a pseudo-random function, but in cryptography it's unwise to rely on any operating system's builtin random function because it has insufficient entropy to be unguessable. Application developers need to add extra entropy whenever it is important to have an unguessable random  
This is the reason people write long tutorials about using dice throws and coin tosses to create strong passphrases and secret keys  
  
  
But that's a diversion. The academic paper is discussing a separate random element (nonce) which is required to be unique for every signature for a given private key. Nobody expects to spend an hour tossing coins to generate a nonce every time they want to spend Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:17:26
If you want to understand why, read what a digital signature is:  
  
A Bitcoin transaction contains inputs and outputs  
The right to spend Bitcoin is determined by who owns the private key for a coin  
Ownership is proved by signing the transaction with the private key  
If you reveal the private key, then you are giving away ownership of your coins  
When you send a Bitcoin transaction, you only send the signature which proves you have the private key. You do not send the private key. This is why Bitcoin is better than using a credit card, because the credit card number must be sent to the merchant, can not be kept secret. Also, Bitcoin is better than PayPal because your login credentials have to be sent to PayPal before you can spend. You cannot keep them secret

Every participant needs to download the entire transaction history to build a database of unspent coins. There is no need to **keep** the entire transaction history. Day-to-day use only requires the database of unspent coins  


Anybody can prune. If everybody prunes then nobody will be able to initialise a new node. Fortunately, it's mostly apple laptop users with tiny SSD storage who actually need to prune. Most of us are using HDD. The 1TB HDD in my 2011 netbook cost $59. It's not an apple  


If someone starting out is like the OP, running a toy computer with a tiny SSD, or a Raspberry Pi with a 32GB USB Flash drive, then pruning is the answer. As you pointed out, only unpruned nodes can help to initialise new nodes. As mentioned elsewhere, it's cheap to get a second-hand PC with enough HDD space, therefore unpruned is the best choice. People make their own constraints. The Core developers added the pruning feature to give an extra choice

A few weeks ago ...  
Bitcoin blocks filled up  
Confirmation times increased to 2+ days  
Fees increased to $30+  
People chose other coins during this period  
mostly Ethereum, Monero and BCash  
I chose Litecoin and Dogecoin. All the merchants I use are now accepting Litecoin, Monero and Ethereum, and some are accepting Dogecoin. I can convert 33000 DOGE to 1 LTC for 2 cents, confirmed in the next block on both chains  
When the blocks are full, the obvious response is to stop trying to force more transactions into them and choose a coin which does not have full blocks. I am not telling you to do this. I am telling you that this is the rational response thousands of Bitcoin users have already chosen  
It does not matter whether I advocate this as the optimum scaling solution. All that matters is the choices made by ordinary users for their transactions  
Many people will keep advocating the One True Coin view, blind to the reality of the rational behaviour of everybody else

The poker example does not work because you're confusing transaction ledger with debt ledger. Your example is a debt ledger. Bitcoin is a transaction ledger  
Bitcoin is not a poker game, but if it was used in poker, every bet is paid from the player to the table when the bet is laid, the winnings are paid from the table to the winner at the end of the hand, and every transaction is recorded in unalterable ink. No chips required  
It's simpler to see Bitcoin in terms of the justification on page 1 of the white paper. If credit cards are inconvenient in the real world, the buyer can choose cash. Bitcoin is analagous to cash, for transactions on the network  
All the components of Bitcoin  
* the Blockchain as an immutable ledger  
* the node network to decentralise the storage of the ledger  
* the node software verifies good transactions and blocks, and rejects invalid transactions and blocks  
* the mining process, which imposes a delay between blocks, so that the node network has enough time to propagate every block to every node before the next block arrives  
All these things are essential to make Bitcoin like cash, to prevent interference from centralised payment processors, and to prevent regulatory interference (and political interference) which constrains the rules of operation of centralised  payment processors

The Blockchain would be 90% smaller just by pruning fully spent transactions. They play no role in validation of consensus, they only bloat the Blockchain

Sorry is that was not clear enough  
A different explanation  
Network communication is handled by your computer's operating system  
The operating system keeps a list of which programs are listening on which ports  
*    If there are no programs listening on port 8333, the operating sends a response "Connection refused"  
*    If there is a program listening on port 8333, the operating system sends all incoming port 8333 traffic to that program  
*    If there is a program listening on port 8333, and another program tries to open port 8333 to listen, the operating system refuses to allow the second program to use that port  
Therefore, all traffic coming in to port 8333 is directed to one program only, if the program is running  


Normally, yes  
You need to be sure you don't install any other programs which listen on port 8333. I assume you weren't planning to do that

Yes, there is a chance that this can happen once before the sun engulfs the Earth, but the chance is very small  
The probability mathematics used for most cryptography does not guarantee zero collisions/duplicates, because zero is mathematically impossible. So the numbers are simply made big enough to be many times larger than the number of particles in the universe and for collisions to be unlikely for the timeframe of the future warmth of the universe  
In other words don't expect absolute guarantees unless you're going to invent a new universe where zero probabilities are part of the reality

Firstly, my node is connected through a VPN gateway in a different country  
My VPN provider does not keep logs linking my public VPN address with my home IP address  
This works, unless my Government bans the VPN I use  
Even then, there is no reliable technical method to enforce a ban on any specific foreign VPN service  
The government would have to rely on selective prosecution - high profile show trials - killing the chicken to frighten the monkey

Tor hides your IP address and the route to your computer. Your computer is still connected to the Internet. There are many apps which leak your real IP address or other identifying details to other users. USA law enforcement has had some success with techniques which exploit these leaks. This is why TAILS was developed. See the documentary Citizen Four

Please re-read  
The million keys on the DVD-R are non-HD  
You don't need a million, maybe you want 100 or only 2  
Most people will need more keys than you can reasonably print on paper  
They're so small you could save more than a billion on a DVD  
But if you have 100, and then you use them all, you need a new backup for the next 100  
I think the HD derivation issue can be fixed with some better documentation and external tools which know the derivation used by each BIP39 wallet. But we're not there yet  
We also need a way to restore a BIP32 Core wallet with just the seed key  
Core's advice on this is not to try saving just the seed, and later restoring the wallet. They advise backing up the full wallet as the only safe option  
Don't ask how the sausage is made, just do what we tell you  
My main objection to HD is what you expressed. Exposing the seed words or the xprv, or exposing one private key and the xpub, allows access to all past and future keys in the HD set, a timebomb for "monitor and wait patiently" theft

@_date: 2019-01-04 02:18:34
The quick answer is the outcome is unpredictable  
There would be a chain fork between the nodes running old and new software versions  
Bitcoin node software automatically reverts "orphan" branches and applies the correct blocks to remain synchronised with the "longest" chain  
When a node sees it has different blocks to its neighbours, it automatically decides which fork is correct  
This decision is not a vote. The majority does not decide which chain is correct. The decision is made by calculating which chain is longest - which one has the greatest amount of work. The longest chain could be the one with invalid blocks  
What actually happens depends on the nature of the bug  
A serious bug, if it allows double-spending, or creation of new coins which are not mining reward, would be discovered by the community and the developers and there would be an emergency bug fix  
What happens next depends on whether all nodes upgrade from the buggy version to the fixed version  
Another complication is the role of miners. If all miners upgrade their nodes, then they will stop producing invalid blocks, so it matters less whether some non-mining nodes fail to upgrade  
The above analysis assumes things happen quickly  
If a bug creates extra value (double-spend or extra coins) and is not noticed for thousands of blocks, then it could be impossible to unwind the corrupt chain branch and replace it

Bitcoin is designed with an automatic mining difficulty adjustment. When profitability falls, some miners leave, then mining difficulty falls automatically, which makes mining profitable for the remaining miners

@_date: 2019-01-24 10:54:05
Documentation describing mining tells us that the miner starts his nonce at zero and then increments it by 1 until he finds a hash which matches the target range. This explains the low-nonce-value bias in the early years on the graphs. In those days, a block could be found before exhausting the range of nonce values  
This is also the reason some people have an expectation of random distribution. If the nonce range is turning over 3000 times per second, and the "increment by one" iteration is still being used, then the nonce distribution should be random  
That documentation is no longer an accurate description of mining  
The nonce is only 32 bits. If your Antminer S9 is hashing at 14 Terahashes per second, it is going to exhaust the entire nonce space from 0 to 4294967295 in less than a millisecond - and there is still 9 minutes 59.999 seconds more hashing to do  


No, I would vary the extranonce  
The only thing these graphs tell is that some miners are no longer starting at zero and incrementing by 1  
The hash is supposed to be a uniformly distributed pseudo-random. SHA2 does not require any of its inputs to be uniformly distributed. The mining process only requires that the input is different every time

Are you proposing replacing every block with a block whose hash is calculated instantly by you, instead of 10 minutes of mining by thousands of miners?  
To make a chain which is a few blocks longer, which will somehow fool the node software into accepting your chain as valid  
Having more blocks does not make a chain more valid  
The "longest chain" is the one with the most proof of work. Your chain has one hash per block, so it's never going to replace a chain with 13 zettahashes per block

What makes the Bitcoin blockchain immutable?  
*    it is public, anybody can check it for tampering  
*    there are more than 10,000 nodes, operated independently. Anybody can see if some nodes have different copies of the Blcokchain. Every node knows whether any of its neighbours has a different chain, just because the hash of the most recent block will be different  
*    the transaction hashes are tied to the block header hash  
*    the block header hash is part of the block header of the subsequent block  
*    proof of work is an input to the block header hash calculation. You can not modify a block header hash without redoing the proof of work, because the block header hash has to satisfy the proof-of-work test by being smaller than the current target hash  
Data change modifies the block header. Modifying the block header changes the block header hash. Changing the block header hash and making it match the proof-of-work test requires repeating the work  
Changing the block header hash requires the prev_ block header hash in the subsequent block to be changed so the blocks link correctly  
Repeat everything in the previous paragraph because the subsequent block header was modified  
Repeat for every block to the most recent  
Obviously, repeating proof of work for more than one block makes it impossible for the tampered data to ever catch up with the ongoing work on the untampered chain, except if the tampered chain has significantly more hash power than the valid chain, for long enough to rehash all the block headers from tampered block to latest block (not impossible, has happened to Bitcoin Gold and Vertcoin)  
Apparently, you asked the wrong question  
You can not guarantee immutability in any blockchain  
The real question is, what is different about a permissioned blockchain which makes it less immutable than a permissionless blockchain  
In the context of the above explanation of immutability in the Bitcoin blockchain, please write a clear definition of "permissioned blockchain" with respect to the attributes described  
Does it have all the same attributes?  
If not, which attributes are missing?  
For each missing attribute, what effect does its absence have on immutability?  
I have not done this exercise for a while, but as I recall, the answer is that tied hashes pretty much cover all you need for tamper-evident immutability. Depending on how publicly visible the chain is, tampering can be further prevented by distribution of responsibility to prevent conspiracy, independent audit, and severe penalties for tampering  
All the other attributes - thousands of independent node operators, proof of work, public visibility - they exist to keep Bitcoin uncensorable, which is its primary purpose. Immutability is not the primary purpose. It serves only to support uncensorability  
A so-called "permissioned blockchain" is censorable

Because the chain is not available, you need some external source of transactions, like a Web block explorer, to discover the outputs for building the inputs of transactions  
Useful for offline signing of unsigned transactions built using an online wallet  
Does not require the chain for transaction signing, because you can supply the secret keys on the command line

Mining was not expensive for several years in Bitcoin's history. Mining rewards were near zero. Bitcoin was mined, a new block every 10 minutes for all those years  


This tunnel-vision view that miners earn $120k per block to hash 24 Exahashes per second, therefore it must always be so, is ludicrous  
As already mentioned, this level of mining is only recent in Bitcoin's history  
Bitcoin keeps working, keeps mining a block every 10 minutes, even if the number of miners decreases  
Bitcoin is secured primarily by thousands of non-mining node operators, each one of them verifying every new block and every transaction and propagating the block to its neighbours. This work is done  for no reward. The main purpose of mining is to regulate the block interval to 10 minutes, a trivial guessing race, not worth financial reward. Yes, greedy miners will be replaced by altruistic miners  
The end of block reward coin issue is more than 120 years into the future, yet this question is repeated here every day as if it is important now

I guess you missed the part where OP_RETURN data has many useful purposes  
and you missed the part where valid input scripts and valid output scripts are all valid, that there is no way to distinguish a "genuine transaction" from a transaction with a script which contains arbitrary data. The validity checking logic can not infer the intent of the transaction maker

Through 2017 the Bitcoin Hash Rate increased from 2.5 Exahashes per second to 22  
You seem to understand all the components, yet miss the overall game  
Bitcoin difficulty auto-adjusts to force mining profitability into slim marginal profit. Adding more hashes reduces the profit per hash - is counterproductive for the whole mining system  
So why does the hash rate keep accelerating in spite of the inbuilt disincentive?  
Because speculators keep driving up the Bitcoin fiat exchange rate  
Eventually the speculation game implodes, Bitcoin returns to being the penny token it was originally designed, mining returns to being a hobby

Too lazy to set one up, or even for European exchanges to adopt the Euro tether  
It's not about being invested in USD. I suspect most customers buy their USDT at Binfinex, and then trade it wherever  
Tether's fixed price makes it a good currency for pairing with everything. Of course Bitcoin pairs with everything too, but its fees and slow confirmations (a couple of months ago, not at the moment), and its price volatility, make it risky as an intermediate currency between 2 illiquid alts, compared to the incredibly stable USDT

Bitcoin transaction inputs and transaction outputs contain scripts, miniature programs which tell Bitcoin how to verify that an input is valid, and how to pay the output  
The scripting language is flexible enough that parts of a script can be replaced with arbitrary data and still be verified as a valid transaction  
Most commonly, convert your image file into tiny chunks of hexadecimal, use the hexadecimal as the output address, waste a few Satoshis sending a valid but unspendable transaction or 50 transactions, depending on the size of the image file  
Then download the output scripts of those transactions, string all the output addresses together, convert the hexadecimal back to binary, there's your image, permanently stored on the Blockchain, impossible to delete  
Alternatively, more simply, but with smaller data chunks:  
One of the Bitcoin scripting instructions is OP_RETURN, which just means stop processing this output script and go back to the main program. You can add a parameter to the OP_RETURN instruction, but because OP_RETURN means "do nothing", all that happens is that parameter (maximum 40 bytes) is stored as part of the transaction. Chop your image file into 40-byte pieces, convert to hexadecimal, make a bunch of transactions each with an OP_RETURN output, etc, same as above. Your image is permanently stored on the Blockchain  
Example:  
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:43:26


It depends. If you're looking for transactions which are still spendable, the number would be small, obviously would be smaller than the UTXO set, which is only a few GB  
Discussed here a few times previously, some miners keep transactions which appear to have expired from mempools and occasionally re-broadcast them, or mine a block containing a few of them  
If somebody wanted to keep a list, nothing prevents anybody re-broadcasting a valid transaction, forever into the future, as an experiment, or just for laughs

The article is based on a fallacy  
The entire argument relies on a claim that Bitcoin mining is centralised because a few mining pools "control" most of the hashing power  
This is a fallacy because mining pools contain thousands of members - the miners. The thousands of members of a mining pool can not conspire to launch a 51% attack against Bitcoin  
The pools do not control the members. The only role of the mining pool is administrative - to distribute the block rewards to the pool members

The price quoted at blockchain.com on 2019-01-09 was 4036, nearly all day  
At this rate the OP received 0.89  
The price quoted on the voucher, 4157.31 is 3.0% higher  
Also, at 4157.31 the amount of Bitcoin, 0.00022129 is only worth 0.92, not 0.96, another 4.3% undeclared charge  
This means they are taking a 4% fee, on top of inflating the price by 3.0%, and taking another 4.3% without explanation

Alternatively, Bitcoin could find a price equilibrium around $1 to $2, and mining could return to being a non-profit hobby. Then fees and halvings become unimportant  
This assumes block space is available. Fees are a clumsy mechanism for managing block space constraints, but there are no other mechanisms  
Avoiding full blocks makes the most sense, but that depends on the behaviour of the mass of users
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:25:07


Definitely not  
Mining costs follow the price down  
Lower price -&gt; lower profits -&gt; fewer miners -&gt; lower difficulty -&gt; lower mining costs  
The "lower difficulty" part is automatic, built-in to the Bitcoin software. This automatic adjustment means that the mining cost does not create a price floor for Bitcoin  
The price can go all the way down to a fraction of a cent, and mining would continue to produce one Bitcoin block every 10 minutes

Too complicated  
As my CS professors used to say, "you're working in the wrong problem space"  
Go back to December 2017 - January 2018. Bitcoin blocks filled. Confirmation delays were days or weeks. Some people were paying $14 fees. This will happen again  
Next time, instead of being emotionally wedded to Bitcoin and screaming for devs to "please fix it!", people can see it coming and just switch to Litecoin (or some other). Eventually people will see that Bitcoin's full blocks are not "fixable", and an equilibrium will arise which prevents Bitcoin blocks filling, because some people will switch to Litecoin just to relieve the pressure on Bitcoin's blocks. Then, Litecoin blocks will start to fill  
Not gold and silver, just two equal copper-nickels alloys  
Bitcoin + Litecoin, double the block space without increasing the block size  
This leads to ...  
Some clever dev will make a new coin, like Bitcoin but with 200k blocks, transaction pruning, coin expiry, 5-minute node intitialisation, small RAM footprint, you can run a node on a phone. With a trivial config change, you can choose from 300 separate blockchains, without modifying the software. Atomic swaps allow transactions between chains  
Now you have 60 times more block space, with smaller blocks. Each chain has more nodes than Bitcoin. Scaling solved, without sidechains
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:44:14


No idea where you read this. It is a nonsense phrase  
Bitcoin transactions contain inputs and outputs. Every input is linked backwards to the output it is spending  
But  
**The outputs of a transaction are not linked to the inputs of the same transaction**  
The Bitcoin world is full of simplified descriptions of "A sends money to B", implying that it's a simple system where every transaction has one input and one output, and therefore the output is linked to the input. In reality, most transactions have at least 2 outputs, and many transactions have many inputs and many outputs  
"Computational power" does not resolve the huge number of permutations of possible connections between outputs and inputs from transaction to transaction. Some analysis can make guesses. Simple transactions, one input and one or two outputs are easier to guess, but even a transaction with 2 outputs is impossible to guess for certain which address belongs to the sender and which address belongs to the recipient  
Mixing creates transactions with multiple inputs, where the inputs belong to many different people, and multiple outputs to the same people, preferably with each person having a different number of inputs and outputs, and non-matching amounts. This is a transaction deliberately constructed to exploit the fact mentioned above  
**The outputs of a transaction are not linked to the inputs of the same transaction**  
Commercial mixers have a risk, and a reputation for the mixer operator to steal the customers' coins  
CoinJoin is a peer-to-peer mixing technique, has been used by the JoinMarket P2P mixer for several years. Wasabi mixing transactions use CoinJoin

One such package - event-stream - was included in Copay, for ??? reason

Not explicitly stated in the paper: the vulnerable keys are vulnerable because of address re-use  
The specific cause of the exposure of private keys is poor entropy in the signature "nonce". The nonce is part of the signature which must be unique for every signature. Two signatures using the same private key and the same nonce will expose the private key. The mathematics is trivial  
Two signatures using similar nonces (using the same private key) can reveal the private key, using mathematical techniques which are not trivial, but are much faster than brute force  
The patterns described in the paper should indicate which wallet software versions are responsible for these signatures, but this work has not been attempted yet  
Using a Web block explorer, clicking backwards and forwards through transactions and addresses, it is easy to see many addresses with thousands of transactions (gross address re-use). Many of these addresses have very large balances

Probably this  
There are reasons to use OP_RETURN to push a few bytes of arbitrary data into a transaction  
Some wallets, payment services and exchanges have used this method to carry additional metadata about a transaction, for example, a merchant can add an invoice number to a payment request, and then the purchaser's wallet can add an OP_RETURN output to the payment transaction to communicate the invoice number to the merchant  
I have a vague memory of an older discussion about this, that someone created a Blockchain specifically for recording document timestamps - for proof of publication date. Can not find any details about this now

Either some of the ideas are flawed, or they are good ideas with the potential to go bad  
**Mining**  
The original intention appears to be that every body runs a full node and everybody mines. But, mining comes with a reward, to encourage honest proof-of-work. The Bitcoin price spiraled into a speculation boom, which in turn made mining into a multi-billion business  
Do we blame Satoshi for rewarding greedy miners?  
Or do we blame the speculators for bidding a 10-cent token up to $20,000?  
Would Bitcoin suffer if mining had zero reward?  
**Exchanges and custodial wallets**  
Somehow we moved from being a few geeks on message boards trusting each other enough to buy and sell Bitcoin informally using PayPal, without chargeback fraud, to a near-universal belief that the only place to buy Bitcoin is from a regulated exchange. This change probably began when some people worked out they could buy Bitcoin using PayPal and then fraudulently chargeback the PayPal transaction. Thieves destroy trust  
Blame MtGox for custodial wallets. They made people too lazy to set up their own wallets. Even after MtGox lost all their customers' coins, people still choose to worship MtGoxV2 - Coinbase and Gemini - and avoid creating their own wallets  
Why don't people set up their own wallets? It's easy, until you start reading about the horrible theft and hacking risks, and thousands of Ledger/Trezor fanboys telling you to pay &gt;$100 for a wallet. But you don't have to buy a hardware wallet. Just run Electrum in cold mode:   
This protocol is great, the instructions accurate and complete, but it is time-consuming and complicated  
As above, step back to the pizza days, when 5000 Bitcoin paid for a pizza. When it was a sub-penny token, Bitcoin did not have a theft risk. Blame the speculators for bidding up the price  
**Nodes**  
Why are there millions of Bitcoin users and only thousands of full nodes? Why does it take hours on an expensive PC to initialise a new node? Why does it take days or weeks on a cheap PC?  
Don't blame Satoshi here. The White Paper contains a design for transaction pruning, keeping the Blockchain small, and making node initialisation fast. This was never implemented. Instead, we have pseudo-pruning, where a new node has to download and process the entire Blockchain, very slowly, and only prune to save disk space  
I'm not blaming the developers either. They have no obligation to code Satoshi's pruning method. Anybody who believes node initialisation is too slow can code Satoshi's transaction pruning (or sponsor a developer) and submit the code to the Bitcoin Github. Nobody has bothered to do it. Therefore, Nobody is to blame

Bitmain struggled to meet demand for their Antminers, so they spent big to increase production capacity  
Just when they managed to have enough capacity to meet demand, the Bitcoin exchange price fell back from its peak, reducing demand for Antminers  
Bitmain has been selling Antminers for 30% below cost since February 2018. The cash outflow was offset by a USD400 million investor topup in mid-2018, on condition that the investors could exit their investment with an IPO  
Sales did not improve. Investors are not pouring in more buckets of cash. The IPO now looks unlikely  
If this rumour is true (this is the third time it has been published), it means the investors have asked the founders Jihan Wu‎ and ‎Micree Zhan to resign from their management positions, in order to save the IPO  
Note: the Bitcoin vs BCash politics and the fall in value of Bitmain's Bitcoin and BCash assets are trivial sideshows. Bitmain's financial problems are mostly caused by having to sell their product below cost for 11 months

Reaching way back into my memory to the tiny amount of political theory I once studied, there is a concept called "legitimacy". Every Government rules with the consent of the people. This concept extends outside the democratic world. Whether authoritarian or democratic, a Government which creates unpopular regulation will be met with mass non-compliance. Even though a Government has the power of violent enforcement, there are not enough enforcement resources to oppose mass non-compliance  
Selective enforcement, show trials, "We Convicted Another Bitcoin Money  Launderer" press releases, these can have an impact  
  
but how many Localbitcoins sellers are going to shut up shop because of the show trial of  Morgan Rockcoons?
Bitcoin can be regulated in one or other country, possibly including the large populations of China and India, and the vast wealth of North America and Europe  
In whichever country I reside, I can rent a server in another country anonymously, using a pseudonym and a free single-purpose email address at an anonymous email server, connect the server to Tor, and make it a Bitcoin node  
I'm not exempt from the laws of my country, but none of my activity is traceable back to my person or my location. I can choose to ignore any Internet regulation I believe is wrong

This is old news. Their work was reported here last year. It was supposedly a big deal that they had resolved some legal issue relating to assigning ownership of coins which had some historical taint, to justify asset confiscation. There was also a bullshit claim that tainting could be attributed proportionally when a transaction has multiple outputs  
So-called "academics" seem to be able to write research papers on Bitcoin without understanding how it works. The peer review system is probably failing because they can't find any peers or seniors who have a clue about Bitcoin. The reviewers should admit this, and all this work should be rejected, left unpublished  


Perhaps it wasn't peer reviewed. Anybody can publish on the Internet. The Web site mentioned in the article is offline  
**EDIT**  
Had a quick scan through the slide presentation. The researchers claim to have identified patterns which reveal some laundering of criminally acquired coins, and admit they have no clue how to generalise, or to find accurate techniques to discover other patterns  
All of the patterns described become irrelevant if the "criminals" stop re-using addresses

You observed that all the words are easily recognisable  
This means you can easily memorise your seed words  
This is why the list is 2048 words, all carefully chosen according to the criteria described in the specification  
  
Each word represents 11 bits of entropy: 2^11 = 2048  
If you wanted 12 bits of entropy per word, you would need a list of 4096 words  
If you wanted to use a list of 1024 words, your seed word list would have more words  
2048 words is a reasonable compromise between the number of seed words required and the ease of recognition of the words  
Also this:  


and  


Compare the diceware method for making passphrases  
  
This uses 5 dice throws per word, which requires a word list of 7776, because 6^5 = 7776  
You can see that many of the words in this list are harder to recognise and remember, because it is a longer list. But then, you don't need 12 words to get 128 bits of entropy  
In 2016, the EFF developed a more carefully chosen diceware wordlist

All those numbers are based on USA electricity prices  
Very few Bitcoins are mined in the USA  
Anyway, your causality is reversed  
The cost of mining a Bitcoin does not create a floor in the Bitcoin price  
The Bitcoin price determines the profitability of mining, and the falling price reduces the cost of mining as it falls  
The cost of mining a coin is proportional to the automatically adjusting difficulty parameter, which is proportional to the hash rate. The hash rate is proportional to the number of miners. The price fall will reduce the profitability of mining, then some miners will retire from mining, the hash rate will decline in proportion, then the difficulty parameter declines in proportion to the hash rate. This reduces the cost of producing a Bitcoin and makes mining profitable for the miners who did not retire  
The price of Bitcoin could fall to $1 and there will still be miners creating a new block every 10 minutes. There will be fewer miners than today, and the cost of mining a Bitcoin will be miniscule, but Bitcoin will keep working

So, your entire argument is that the average block time since genesis is 10.6 minutes, not 10 minutes?  
Perhaps you can post something relevant to your disaster prediction  


In spite of all the disaster predictions made every week in this subreddit, "What if all the miners suddenly stopped mining?" and "What if so many miners suddenly stopped mining that it takes years for the difficulty to adjust?"  
It did not happen in October 2017, when the BCash trolls predicted that the hash rate oscillation would cause Bitcoin to never reach the next adjustment  
It did not happen in November 2017, when all the miners were predicted to switch to the SegWit2X fork  
It did not happen in December 2017, when Operation Dragonslayer was supposed to instantly switch all miners from Bitcoin to BCash immediately after a difficulty adjustment  


Fees are offered as part of a transaction, not charged by the miners. It is ludicrous to suggest that Bitcoin users will volunteer to boost mining profitability by sending unnecessarily high fees  
The fallacy underlying your analysis is that you're depicting mining as a monolithic operation. Miners are individuals. As profitability falls, some miners will retire. Their exit will repair profitability for the remaining miners. Hash rate falls, difficulty falls, blocks continue to appear on the Blockchain  
There is a possible scenario where a significant proportion (maybe 70%) of miners suddenly leave Bitcoin within one difficulty epoch. This might extend the length of that epoch to months instead of days. This disaster is frequently predicted but never happens. Only fools keep repeating these predictions

The mining difficulty is a number calculated from the current mining target  
Details:   
The target was originally specified (in the Satoshi White Paper) as the minimum number of leading zeros required to discover the hash for the next block. This is impractical because it would only allow the target to adjust by powers of 2. Instead, the target is a maximum integer value for the block hash. This is similar to counting the leading zeros, but allows for finer adjustment  
Every 2016 blocks, the target is adjusted by comparing the elapsed time for creating the most recent 2016 blocks with the target time of 20160 minutes. If the time was slow, the target is increased proportionally. If the elapsed time was faster than 20160 minutes, the target is decreased proportionally  
This mechanism adjusts the target so that the next 2016 blocks are more likely to take exactly 20160 minutes  
The difficulty is inversely related to the target  
The difficulty goes up or down after the global hash rate goes up or down  
The difficulty number is calculated in a way that makes it useful for calculating the average number of hashes required to mine a block

This is an extreme hypothetical  
The probability that fiat currencies will be displaced by Bitcoin, or other deflationary decentralised cryptocurrencies is nearly zero  
If such an extreme outcome arose, then why not assume that all other economic fundamentals can be overthrown at the same time?  
No lending, cash only. It's a very simple answer, and the best fit for the revolution your question proposes  


The assumption here is that house prices remain too high to pay cash, a standard flaw in discussions about future scenarios, the belief that all other things stay the same  
Recognise that house prices are high enough to require credit, mainly because everybody buys houses with credit. Remove all credit from the economy, house prices fall to a level which is affordable with cash. This one is easy to answer because residential property is mostly an unproductive asset, in an economic sense  
More interesting is the question of borrowing for a business, because the profits from investing borrowed money are higher than the loan interest. It's possible even this type of credit will vanish when the infinite growth paradigm finally collapses, whether Bitcoin is a currency or not  
And then there's trade credit, essential for the efficient operation of day-to-day business. This is an obvious candidate for interest-free credit, because so much delayed payment to business suppliers is effectively interest-free already. Overdrafts would probably have to be replaced by saved profits or other forms of owners' equity

There are no "balances"

Your transaction chain has a related error  
B does not send 0.3 back to B because that would be reusing the same address. Addresses are designed to be used once only  
The blockchain size can be reduced by pruning transactions, deleting a transaction some time after all its outputs (coins) have been spent  
If this is important to you, you can volunteer to write the code. The method for deleting fully spent transactions is described in Satoshi's White Paper. It is fairly simple

Sidechains are a valid scaling solution, but in my (intuitive) opinion, they breach the principle of unnecessary complexity. Firstly, bolting a new and different set of processes onto the existing, successful bitcoin infrastructure is cumbersome. Secondly, at least in the case of Lightning, there are repudiation processes, a fundamental deviation from the original bitcoin proposal

You're right, they should ask for a refund address for every transaction, like shapeshift does, in case something breaks unpredictably  
Of course, you can't use Changelly without signing up, so broken transactions are handled by logging in and sending a message, or sending email  
Refund address is only required for refunds, not for identifying the transaction  
To identify incoming, they follow the standard practice of never re-using their incoming addresses  
Every transaction is assigned a fresh, new, unused address for receiving the customer's coins. This way the only possible coins coming to that address are the coins for that transaction. This is very simple  


Are sent to 2 different receiving addresses

LOL, you're stuck in a status quo view of a coin with full blocks and an overflowing mempool  
See my earlier comment, and dozens of others in the past 2 months, that the solution to full blocks is to abandon the "One True Coin" view and choose another currency, say Litecoin. Bitcoin congestion pressure is relieved by sharing the transaction demand with Litecoin. After a few months, both coins have full blocks, pick a third coin

Third-party payment providers have long lists of banned purchase types  
In real-life, these bans can be circumvented using cash  
Online, cash is impractical, so there was a gap, now filled by cryptocurrency  
This is described in 2 sentences on the first page of the Bitcoin white paper. Perhaps you can read it, just the first page  


Goods and services can now be bought and sold online, circumventing the Visa ban list, and the PayPal ban list. Cryptocurrency value is the net economic value of those transactions which were previously impossible  


Because much regulation interferes with the freedom of buyers and sellers to choose what they want to buy and sell  


Volatility is a management issue. There are strategies to mitigate the risks. They are the same strategies which have been used for decades by businesses using multiple fiat currencies to buy their supplies and sell their products  


Obviously side-by-side  
But there are serious liability risks incurred by merchants accepting credit cards for online commerce. When these liabilities turn into lawsuits, the use of credit cards (and password-based systems like PayPal) for online commerce will be completely replaced by cryptocurrency. When this happens, it will happen almost overnight

It is physically impossible to prevent Bitcoins moving across national borders  
Therefore the only way to ban the use of Bitcoin for wealth export is to make it difficult to buy Bitcoin with China Yuan  
People who already own Bitcoin will not be affected  
Banning exchanges, or more likely, regulating exchanges with very small transaction limits, will be an effective strategy against wealth export  
Yes people can still buy Bitcoin through person-to-person purchase, but those transactions are limited by their nature. Your Localbitcoins trader might be able to sell you 4 or 5 Bitcoins, but not 400-500, so this is not a practical means for wealth export

Correct  
The Blockchain only stores transactions  
Transaction outputs contain addresses  
Wallets are private, they contain many addresses  
If somebody told you all the addresses in their wallet, then you can see the balance of the wallet using any Bitcoin software  
Otherwise, you can only see the current balance of any address  
Private keys are irrelevant to this question  
Mined coins are sent to a mining pool manager's address  
Those addresses will nearly all have zero balance, because the pool manager has to disburse the mining rewards to the miners in his pool

Everything else shows your merchant is incompetent  
Apart from the obvious, that they should resolve the availability issue before accepting your order, they have no clue how to use Bitcoin  
They should have send you a unique address for the transaction, and then would know that any Bitcoin at that address is from you for that specific purchase. Screenshots, transaction ID, completely unnecessary  
The merchant should also ask you when you make the order, to supply an address from your wallet, for sending a refund. If the product is not available, then they should send the refund instantly

Possibly, assuming the block explorer's Blockchain isn't propagating an orphan block. Waiting for extra confirmations - more blocks to be confirmed after your transaction's block - reduces the possibility of an orphan chain branch on the block explorer node you're using to verify  
Two blocks, three blocks, six blocks, check multiple block explorers, install a watching wallet on Electrum on your phone, whatever you think is sufficient, depending how much money you're risking  
* $5 - zero confirmations, verify there's an unconfirmed transaction in the mempool  
* $50000 - six confirmations, check on Electrum and three block explorers  
any amount in between, use your judgment

Separate  
Every network node validates every new block, and validates the transactions inside it  
A block is not considered valid unless it has been verified by the node network  
Most network nodes are not miners  
Non-mining nodes are not paid, they verify blocks for zero reward  
The miners should validate the transactions before they start mining a new block, because the block will be rejected by all the nodes if it contains invalid transactions, and then the miner gets no rewards

Correct  
Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty to keep the block delay at 10 minutes average  
This means that in terms of earning Bitcoin, adding more mining capacity is self-defeating because it reduces the profitability of mining for all miners  
In terms of fiat-value, profitability depends on fiat-value costs and the fiat exchange price of Bitcoin, so an increasing Bitcoin price can more than offset the difficulty increase  
Your original post has the same "all or nothing" error as many of these questions about mining profitability. Yes, price falls drive miners to leave Bitcoin, but only some miners. As some miners retire, difficulty falls, and profitability is restored for the remaining miners

That makes no sense. The block hash proves that the block has not been modified after creating it. You can not add more data into the block without recalculating the hash  
Everything has to be assembled into the block before mining begins. You select about 2000 unconfirmed transactions from the mempool. Add up the fees. Add the total fees to the block reward. Create a coinbase transaction - zero inputs, one output. The output address is for you. The amount is the block reward plus the fees. Make that the first transaction in the block  
Calculate the merkle root:  
*   
* calculate every transaction hash  
* put all the transactions into pairs  
* hash the pairs of transaction hashes  
* repeat hashing pairs of hashes until there is only one hash  
* that is the Merkle root hash  
Hash the header about 4 billion times, changing the nonce each time. When your nonce runs out of bits, add a random chunk of data as an extra non-payment output to your coinbase transaction. Recalculate the Merkle root hash. Hash the header another 4 billion times until the nonce runs out of bits, and so on until you eventually calculate a hash which is below the current target hash  
You're the winner!  
Broadcast your block to all your neighbour nodes. They will verify that it is a valid block, and broadcast it to their neighbours. Wait 100 blocks and your mining reward will be available for spending  
Your terminology is wrong. SHA256 is a hashing algorithm. Concatenating header data does not create a hash. Running SHA256 on the header creates a hash

I can't see the problem here  
At the point you're confusing him, Bitcoin is equivalent to cash  
You hand the man in the shop $20,  
he gives you a sandwich,  
puts your $20 into his register,  
gives you $14 change  


To buy a sandwich, of course  
Strictly speaking, Bitcoin does not use wallets either. Wallet is just a convenient metaphor for a collection of key pairs, plus the the set of UTXOs which give value to some of the private keys in the wallet  
The only part of that which is important to Bitcoin is the UTXOs, 
the ability to cryptographically verify that a transaction signature matches the address attached to a UTXO, and to know that the TXO is still unspent  


But they don't  
Coins do not change address  
Private keys stay securely in the wallet  
Wallets make transactions containing one or more inputs and one or more outputs  
Coin (using the terminology in the original Satoshi paper), means UTXO  
You can only spend a coin once  
You can only spend a coin completely  
A coin has zero value after you spend it  
Each input is a UTXO from an old transaction, plus a signature created from the private key linked to the UTXO  
Each output is an address - our sandwich example has 2 outputs: $6 to the shopkeeper, $14 to an unused address in your wallet (sometimes called a change address, for obvious reason)  
Here, we deviate from the cash equivalence:  
Before the sandwich transaction there is a $20 coin in the customer's wallet  
After the sandwich transaction that $20 UTXO becomes a spent TXO and has zero value  
The transaction created 2 new coins: $6 in the shopkeeper's wallet, and $14 in the customer's wallet  
The original $20 coin no longer exists, because a coin can only be spent once  
The 2 new coins are the unspent outputs (UTXOs) of the sandwich transaction: the $6 coin controlled by a private key in the shopkeeper's wallet, the $14 change coin controlled by a private key in the customer's wallet

Cheap is a problem for a Bitcoin node  
There are a lot of great cheap VPS services, but price determines the specifications of the server or VPS  
Does it have at least 2GB RAM - the minimum for a node?  
If it does, the price will not be lower than 20 Euro per month  
Does it have a HDD or SSD?  
SSD is no good because none of them are large enough for storing the Blockchain, unless you're paying 140 Euro for a server with 400GB SSD  
and then there is CPU  
A slow CPU, or a shared CPU on a VPS, will take 2-3 weeks to initially sync the Blockchain  
Bandwidth should not be an issue. Even the cheapest VPS will offer 1TB or 2TB per month, and then if you exceed the limit, they do not charge excess usage fees, they only slow down your server to 100MBit, still fast enough for a Bitcoin node

If the only patches are the 3 I listed, forever, review should be trivial,  
but there would be heavy reliance on a robust test infrastructure to catch unexpected consequences  
I was assuming that future patches would be extremely rare  
In the real world, software is never isolated from external pressures, so over the longer term, there will be more and more BTC1 patches to merge with each new Core release  
If BTC1 with replay protection becomes a viable alt Blockchain in the long term, it will attract developers, perhaps the ABC team will join BTC1 when BCash finally dies

Bitcoin is brilliant, will never go away

New coins will exist alongside Bitcoin, and some of them will be designed differently, in response to the problems now apparent in Bitcoin's design  
Zero mining rewards, for example, so that the mining incentive is purely altruistic  
Perhaps we can have a discussion about innovative options for distributing new coins, for a cryptocurrency which does not reward miners

No, the risk in this bug is double-spending  
The double spend has to originate from a miner  
A few thousand non-compliant non-mining nodes would cause a temporary chain fork if one of these invalid blocks was propagated  
The fork would only affect a few nodes, and those nodes would rewind and catch up when the invalid block causes no more blocks to be added to the out-of-date nodes' chains

This topic is speculative, but the FAQs which discuss it indicate that decreasing the "100 millionth" denomination would be done to keep Bitcoin usable without issuing more coins  
I've written about this previously, that a hard fork can create smaller denominations by using the version field in the transaction to distinguish "before fork" transactions from "after fork" fork transactions. Then the amount in V1 transactions stays as it is now, Satoshis valued as multiples of 100 millionth, and the amount field in V2 transactions can have a new name (eg Chaum) and be valued at multiples of, say, 10 billionth, as long as the size of the number is less than 64 bits. Then the code is modified to handle the different multipliers depending on version  
The two big benefits of this approach:  
* the existing Blockchain remains unmodified, immutable  
* the fork creates more currency without issuing more Bitcoins, retaining Bitcoin's deflationary feature

As you said, a brand-new node only knows the seed node addresses supplied with the node software  
Every node asks every node it connects to, to send IP addresses of other nodes. Most nodes are connected to 50 or more others, so the new node almost instantly discovers as many nodes as it is configured to connect to, then remembers them all, and can always discover more if some of them drop out

With respect to Bitcoin, all these numbers are moot  
Bitcoin's position in the world money market is constrained by Bitcoin's maximum transaction rate  
The transaction rate is never likely to exceed 10 transactions per second, after all feasible scaling improvements  
The future has Bitcoin reaching maximum capacity, then the loss of utility - slower confirmations - will deter use. New blockchains will be created to alleviate the congestion. Bitcoin will continue to exist as one of many. An equilibrium will arise, where new blockchains will be created whenever transaction capacity becomes congested, and the overall cryptocurrency ecology will spread across multiple blockchains  
This means that any calculation which relies on the scarcity of Bitcoin is irrelevant. When Bitcoin is one of many currencies, there is no scarcity of coins

Bitcoin mining costs are proportional to the Bitcoin difficulty  
Bitcoin adjusts the mining difficulty automatically  
Price goes down -&gt; some miners quit -&gt; hash rate goes down -&gt; difficulty goes down -&gt; block reward is distributed to fewer miners -&gt; mining is profitable for the remaining miners  
This is a continuous cycle. Mining will still be profitable when the Bitcoin price falls below $2

Yes, but  
* some miners quit, which drives down difficulty, restoring profitability for miners who don't quit  
* miners are not in it for the short term, example: the recent price fall from 12000 to 6000-8000 coincided with a huge increase in miners, because of the sporadic availability of the favoured mining hardware, because mining hardware ordered 2 months ago was finally delivered in the 3rd week of January  


Assume Antminer S9, 98 Joules per Terahash  
Look up the current per-second hash rate on blockchain.info, multiply by 600 seconds to get the number of hashes per block  
You're the maths guy, you have:  
* ?? hashes per block  
* 98 Joules per Terahash  
* 3.6 MJ per kW-hour  
* electricity price per kW-hour?  
The equation is simple enough  


1-2MB per 10 minutes  


Yes there is, years into the future. The current chain is less than 200GB, 10% of the capacity of a cheap 2TB HDD. If you're serious about numbers, Blockchain size is an insignificant issue right now  


No causality here, just coincidence  
Fees are not charged by miners, they are chosen by transaction senders. Full blocks cause transaction confirmation delays, and fees are a response to delays - paying to jump the queue  


Indirectly. Volume is directly driven down by confirmation delays, caused by full blocks. As stated above, fees are a response to delays. Although many people say they're leaving Bitcoin because of the fees, they're actually leaving because of the confirmation delays. Everybody has a choice to choose low fees and wait patiently. In January I sent a low-fee transaction and waited 23 days for confirmation. Many people did the same. This is more than hair-splitting. It is important to understand that fees are not a cause, but a symptom of other issues  
OK, many of your other causalities are inaccurate, because you're interlinking 2 processes which remain mostly separate - mining and use  
Here's a simpler analysis  
**Mining**  
Mining is a low-margin game. Miners enter, stay or leave based on profitability. Profitability is measured in fiat values. This means that price is a significant profitability parameter, but only when it's high  
Bitcoin automatically adjusts difficulty, up or down, every 2016 blocks. This automatic adjustment actually makes it counter-profitable to add extra mining capacity - if profitability is measured in Bitcoin  
**Price**  
Bitcoin price is currently nothing more than an irrational speculators' market. Don't believe anything people say about external factors, the China ban (or not), the Korea ban (or not), the India ban (or not). Only fools buy into a market which is 100% irrational psychology. Some of these fools profit from selling to later fools. It is an unsustainable price bubble  
**Use**  
Block are full, transactions are delayed, Bitcoin is hard to use. The mob shouts for their god-like software developers to fix it now please  
Blocks are full because they are a limited size, and there is a delay between blocks. The reason for these 2 parameters has been discussed and debated endlessly for a couple of years  
Rather than perpetuate that debate, how about a rational response instead? Accept that Bitcoin runs reliably as it is, and the transaction throughput limit is a consequence of the same set of parameters which make it run reliably. There is a rational choice  
* accept the limit as it is, or  
* risk the reliability of Bitcoin by fiddling with its fundamental operating parameters  
Obviously, I've chosen option 1.  So how do I respond to Bitcoin being at capacity? Simple, I use Litecoin and Dogecoin. I spend cryptocurrency regularly with several merchants. They are also aware that Bitcoin has reached capacity, and their response was to widen their payments to accept other currencies - Litecoin and others  


3 or 4, maybe 7-10 transactions per second, depending on the minor improvements offered by SegWit, and later in 2018, Schnorr signatures  


Yes, and value is not the same as price. As already stated above, price is a madman's game. Value is intangible, but can be estimated as the economic value of purchases which were enabled by the existence of Bitcoin - where there are various barriers to merchants accepting Visa or PayPal. In the medium term, credit cards and PayPal will be seen as insecure because they rely of customers sending their secret numbers and passwords across the Internet. Cryptocurrencies can completely displace the old, unsafe methods of online purchase - but do they add value for that? Only a little, since they're only fixing a security issue, not enabling transactions which were previously impossible  






Nothing so exciting  
Price collapse is inevitable, eventually, probably back to under $2, based on the value analysis described above  
A price collapse would not be disastrous, except for the speculators, but they're not important. After all, they only invested what they could afford to lose, and when they've lost it, they'll be gone  
There is nothing about Bitcoin which requires it's price to be above $2. In this subreddit, there are frequent claims that a price collapse would be the end of Bitcoin. How? Bitcoin ran happily along at $2 or lower for several years. It can return to that, and just keep running reliably  


Bitcoin is not an investment. It is a currency with a specific niche utility for certain types of online transactions. Some people will invest, the price will rise, they will sell for a profit. Fair enough. Many more people will lose everything they invest, because the price will collapse and align with Bitcoin's value as a payment method for online purchases

*    There are times when the stock market moves in the opposite direction to the Bitcoin fiat exchange price

Bitcoin knows no account numbers  
The Blockchain only contains transactions  
Transactions only have inputs and outputs  


One of the sender's private keys  
Every address represents a separate key pair  
The ordinary user's wallet contains dozens, or hundreds of keys  


Verification needs to prove that the signature in the input gives the right to spend one of outputs of an old transaction  
The public key is part of the transaction input. The verification is 2 steps - check that the signature matches the public key, then hash hash hash to match the public key to the address stored in the transaction output being spent  
The Blockchain is also checked to find if the old transaction output has been spent already - no double spending

Each brute force attempt needs to SHA512 2048 times just to get the xpriv, then there's more work to get from xpriv to a list of addresses  
A word represents 11 bits  
If you're missing one word, and the other words are in order, and you know the position of the one word, then on average you need to brute force 2^10 times, and each of these involves 2^11 SHA512 calculations, so that's 2^21 * SHA512. This is not looking good  
Using the fact that the 4 bits at the end (assuming the 12th word is not the missing one) are derived from a SHA256 checksum, you can reduce your SHA512 search by 4 bits and add 11 bits of SHA256 calculations: 2^11 * SHA256 + 2^17 * SHA512. That's 16 times better but will still take months

Nothing  


Cryptocurrency is not for investment. There is some speculation behaviour. All those speculators (so-called investors) are going to lose, and then go away  
It's great for the planet. Small cryptocurrencies use hardly any energy. Bitcoin only uses a lot of energy because there are too many miners, which is because it is over-priced  
More coins, low Bitcoin price, minimal energy use. This is sustainable

If you're running a member Web site, you might have scripts delivering the content? Why are you manually activating accounts? As a merchant, running your own wallet includes the ability to automate the actions triggered by the payment receipt. This example:  
  
probably has more than you need, payment requests and so on. The basic requirement is to send a fresh address for each expected payment, and then activate your back-end process as soon as Electrum tells you a payment has arrived. The address acts as a unique link (like an invoice number) to tell you exactly who the payment is from and what it's for. Because there is no third party processor, the payment processing is several levels simpler

This assumes that decentralisation and resistance against regulation are separate. They are not  
The purpose of designing Bitcoin decentralised is to avoid regulation, specifically to avoid payment censorship - the giant black list of "Thou shalt not buy and sell these items" with credit cards and PayPal. These lists are not created from the moral whims of the Visa and PayPal company boardrooms. They are created as a result of political interference, either as regulation or as threats to regulate or simply a message from a politician "we've been getting a lot of complaints"  
In the real world, a consumer can circumvent these ban lists by paying with cash. Bitcoin was invented to provide a cash equivalent for online transactions  
All of what Bitcoin is, all the components which make it work, are designed to support the purpose of being a cash equivalent payment system, out of reach of political interference

I doubt there is anything special about operating a Bitcoin ATM business which would force you to incorporate. But, since it's a money business, you would consider whether you want the personal liability of your customers' accidental losses, or whether you want to shift the liability to an asset-poor corporation, and of course, as a director/officer of the corporation do you really escape personal liability for customers' losses anyway?

Not exactly. That was the original design, but it works slightly differently in practice. The hash has to be less than a pre-determined target. The target is automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks, up or down, depending on whether the previous 2016 blocks took more than or less than 14 days  
The number of leading zeros is not a fine enough adjustment, because it can only change by a power of 2  


Convert them to binary, concatenate them all together and pass them to the SHA256 algorithm (twice),  
then increment the nonce and try again,  
keep going until the SHA256 result is less than the target  
See the code here:   
Verifying a block uses exactly the same algorithm as mining, 
but only takes an instant, because the winning hash and the corresponding nonce are recorded in the block  
The first transaction in every block includes the miner's address. Nearly all mining is done in mining pools, so the address is the pool's address, and then the pool administrators split the block reward among all members of the pool

This debate is starved by the focus on only two options for scaling Bitcoin - bigger blocks or sidechains  
The discussion is also coloured by speculators, who just want buzzwords to use for price pumping. These people don't care about any fundamental issues, care only for their own greed  


The third option  
More coins, more blockchains  
If Bitcoin's blocks fill again, use Litecoin  
When Bitcoin blocks and Litecoin blocks are full, make another one  
This approach offers the opportunity for continuous improvement - smaller blocks, more decentralisation, privacy improvements, fast node initialisation, atomic swaps

Same here, except  
I entered the BitPay invoice number into here:  
  
This exposes the receiving address, amount and fee  
You can use the details to make your own transaction  
**EDIT**  
Post-transaction followup  
The Bitpay invoice was expecting a transaction fee of 15 Sat/byte  
I sent a transaction with a fee of 250 Satoshis, about 1Sat/byte  
The mempool was fairly busy at the time, confirmation took 12 hours  
The payment was successful  
Note that Bitpay is still adding an additional "Network fee" - 8300 Satoshis - which is supposedly  
*    to fund the cost of a UTXO lookup  
*    or to fund the transaction fee for converting the payment to fiat for the merchant  
depending on which Bitpay blog article you read  
Neither of these are valid excuses, since UTXO lookups are something Bitpay's full nodes are able to do at near-zero marginal cost, and fiat conversion costs for the merchant should be covered by the fee charged to the merchant, not gouged out of the customer's payment
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:03:48

Not creating a new wallet. The Blockchain has no knowledge of wallets  
Use a new address for every receipt  
Do not use exchanges which require proof of identity, because they will tell the authorities your identity and the Bitcoin addresses you used  
The Blockchain is a full trace linking every transaction input to an output of an earlier transaction, but tells nothing about who owns the addresses in those outputs  
If the ownership of addresses is revealed independently of the transactions, then the Blockchain can be used to link transactions to people  
Re-use of addresses, and public disclosure of addresses makes Bitcoin a privacy risk  
By itself, the Bitcoin Blockchain is anonymous  
Also, private disclosure of identity to an exchange or even to a merchant is a potential privacy breach - depending on whether hostile parties are able to access the identity details held by merchants and exchanges

Ambiguous, you need to clarify which is "they" and "their"  
But if you re-read my earlier post,  
it describes a simple process:  
Three small patches to make Core into BTC1  
BTC1 could re-apply BTC1 patches to Core every time there is a new Core release  
Re-applying the same 3 patches to every Core release should not be hard  
As with all software changes, I repeat my earlier point that robust testing is necessary to identify any unexpected consequences  
But the actual process of applying the same code patches to every new Core release is not complicated ...  
*    Download Core  
*    Check that Core has not changed the code which is affected by the BTC1 patches  
*    Apply the patches  
This requires a couple of small scripts, and a careful eye check of the relevant code  
Assuming that BTC1 makes no additional changes  
Assuming that Core does not make major changes/rewrites to the parts which are patched by BTC1  
These are reasonable assumptions, but not guaranteed  


Strongly disagree  
Any competent coder can read another coder's work  
But it's definitely not a case of blind automatic patching

The most important reason for sweeping a paper wallet is if somebody gave you the paper wallet instead of sending Bitcoin to your address using a Blockchain transaction  
In this situation, the paper wallet giver knows the private key, and could steal the funds if you leave them on the paper wallet you were given  
In principle, this also applies to those Bitcoin ATMs which print a paper wallet

Your best approach is to ask around your friends and colleagues if they want it for cash. Import the private key into Electrum. Set the fee to 2500-5000 Satoshis - less than GBP0.50, and warn your friend that the Bitcoins might take a few days to arrive, because of the low fee

Section 7 describes a method to delete fully spent transactions  
This work has not yet been done  
Why?  
The main reason is that nobody has bothered to do it  
Another reason would be that it's not important to save HDD space if the amount of HDD space required is relatively small, 10% of the space on a typical cheap HDD  
The philosophical objection is that it changes the principle that the Blockchain is immutable, never modified, only appended  
Any person with a month or two of free time, and competent C++ coding skills could implement Satoshi Section 7 pruning. Section 7 pruned nodes could operate alongside the existing Core full nodes, and Core pruned nodes. There would be minor incompatibilities - full nodes will expect unpruned blocks to be sent on request - but these incompatibilities are less than the ones which apply to Core pruned nodes today  
Ignoring the HDD space issue, which is trivial, as already mentioned ...  
Section 7 pruning would speed up the initial sync process, by ignoring fully spent transactions in the UTXO database build  
Is it necessary to keep fully spent transactions in their blocks forever?  
* not necessary for UTXO database, since none of the pruned transactions have any UTXO  
* necessary for strict immutability, and there can be a debate about the value of Blcokchain immutability  
* necessary for all those "list by address" historical transaction lists on Web block explorers and wallets  
* not necessary for fully tracing a path from any transaction back to its block reward transaction, because multi-input transactions create thousands of possible paths  


Proportionally, the space saving would be huge  
In an absolute sense, 200GB is not a large amount of data, so the saving would be trivial

I oppose the BTC1 project, but I'll play devil's advocate for a moment, and look at the project objectively ...  


The lack of progress in this piece,  
plus the announcement of a code freeze  
probably means that the intention is to go with the 0.14 codebase in November  


For all the criticism in this thread about copy/paste development, it's a valid strategy  
*    Start with working code, add a patch  
It could be possible to download every new Core release,  
re-apply the 2X patch, and live happily ever after  
The quoted GitHub page seems to indicate something else,  
a peanut gallery of hecklers throwing their wishlist of pet enhancements at the BTC1 project because they have been unsuccessful at getting their requests into Core  
The strategy is also complicated by two other issues:  
*    the need to add replay protection to BTC1  
*    the Core enhancement which shuns 2X nodes  
Even so, this just means BTC1 could be Core plus 3 small patches  
*    the 2X patch  
*    replay protection, code already available in BCash  
*    overriding the Core logic which shuns 2X nodes  
This would require a solid commitment to refusing all other requests for enhancement and a commitment to embrace the Core development pathway forever  
I don't mean that this is trivial work  
The code review and testing is a significant burden of work, even for such "minimal" changes  
The point is that with scarce developer resources in the BTC1 project,  
reducing the BTC1 project scope to the bare minimum and devoting all the resources to review and testing is the only viable project strategy  
It's not abandoned yet

Your OP indicates that you have conflicting information about the balance

It's better than paper currency because the only way to send paper currency over distances is by snail mail, with legal consequences and theft risk  
It's better than credit cards because credit card payments over the network require sending your secrets (card number and CVV number) to the merchant. Bitcoin works by sending only a signed transaction, and keeping your secrets safely to yourself  
Better than credit cards, better than PayPal because there is no central authority restricting how you're allowed to use your money  
Bitcoin is a simpler (often cheaper) way to send money internationally. There are no fees and buy/sell spreads charged for international currency conversion, because there is no international currency conversion - convert to Bitcoin, send Bitcoin, convert from Bitcoin

ELI5 is unrealistic for this question  
No 5-year-old would grasp the concept of one-way unforgeable hashes  
Use a one-way cryptographic hashing algorithm on all the data in a block,  
uniquely identify every block by its hash,  
then the data in a block is protected against tampering,  
because any change will be exposed by the fact that the hash no longer matches the data  
Include the immediate prior block's hash as part of the data in every block  
This links all the blocks together in a chain  
The entire chain is protected against tampering because any data change invalidates a block hash,  
and any block hash change breaks a link in the chain


It works because tampering with historical data would invalidate the hash of the block containing that data,  
and modifying the hash would then invalidate the hash of the subsequent block, and so on, regressively

Or less bare perhaps  
Make up a number, annual living expenses, round it up for income tax  
Find the current net rental return (percentage) for 1-2 bedroom apartments near a hospital or university  
Divide annual living expenses by net rental return,  
add the purchase price of your own residence if you don't already own one  
or the payout amount for your current mortgage
Something like 80,000 / 4% + 500,000 = $2.5 million  
This will give you a house to live in, plus $2 million worth of rental apartments paying $80,000 per year before income tax  
Adjust the numbers to suit your definition of "humble modest life",  
actual house prices where you want to live,  
actual apartment rental returns nearby your local hospital/university  
This is a conservative strategy. Variations involving investments other than residential rental property and debt gearing will have different yields, different risks, more or less administrative workload

If there is enough justification to use Bitcoin, then the State does not have sufficient enforcement resources to combat mass non-compliance  
The bar is fairly high though. Read through some of the "what if" threads here discussing tax non-compliance. There is a very strong preference for compliance with law  


This is easy. If you've already decided to disobey the Bitcoin ban, then you might as well do everything underground, including property purchase  
Tax is a separate question  
If Bitcoin is banned, and fiat currency has collapsed, and people disobey the ban and conduct all their trading and wages payments in Bitcoin, then how will the Government collect taxes?  They can't collect your tax in Bitcoin, because they banned it. They can't collect tax in fiat because nobody has any, and it's worthless anyway  
In this scenario, the Government's only option would be to reverse the ban, simply to be able to receive tax

That's the reason for the hate  
Firstly, the 2X fork is a scam, so Bitcoin users can reasonably expect a large player like Coinbase to choose the non-scam Bitcoin  
Secondly, the announcement is worded to appear neutral, but this is ambiguous:  


Interpreted literally, this would make BCash the "true Bitcoin", for a day or two at a time, as the miners flip-flop their hashing power from chain to chain  
Obviously, there is no intention to change the choice of which chain is BTC 3-4 times every week, so Coinbase's clarification announcement did not actually clarify anything  
The Coinbase announcement treats the fork coin and the original Bitcoin as 2 equal competitors in an open marketplace  
In reality the 2X coin will be so weak that it has barely any chance of surviving into 2018  
The "hate" is driven by the discrepancy between the 2X coin's true place as a weakling scam coin, and Coinbase's view of 2X as an equal competitor to Bitcoin

Also, the validation process is subject to a short-cut since v0.14.0, using the "assumevalid" option in the config  
  
This still leaves "why do I need to download the whole chain?" unanswered. The answer is that the initialisation is more than just storing the entire chain, and is more than just validating the chain  
There are databases which work as indexes to provide a node with fast access to blocks, transactions, addresses, and unspent outputs  
The only way to build these databases is to read the entire Blockchain  
The reason for this is that the Blockchain is immutable - new blocks are added to the end, nothing is ever modified or deleted  
This means that an output is never modified to change its status from unspent to spent  
The only way to determine the unspent/spent status of an output is to search the whole chain to discover if any transaction input points back to a specific output  
This "search" is done during the initialisation when it builds the UTXO database  
TLDR: you can't make a transaction without checking that its inputs exist in the UTXO db. You can only build the UTXO db by processing the complete Blockchain

The gap problem is a software bug, not a flaw in the HD concept or design

Probably not. The calculator makes assumptions about the variables. If the price goes down, the gross income falls in proportion. Does not take much of a price fall to go from daily profit to daily loss  
Also, the difficulty increases more quickly than most people anticipate. From Jan 2017 to Dec 2017, the hash rate increased from 2.3 Exahashes / second to 11.8 Exahashes / second. In 2018 so far, the hash rate has doubled

Your question shows prejudice in the use of the term "Alts",  
the "one true Bitcoin" prejudice  
In reality the cryptocurrency marketplace has many coins, and all the useful ones are exchangeable with Bitcoin and with each other  
Bitcoin is only one coin in a larger market  
The ability to create new coins and new chains, with a few lines of code and by renting a chunk of multi-coin hashing capacity means that there is no real scarcity  


Bitcoin's scarcity is the main reason for creating new currencies  
When a small group of foolish "investors" drives Bitcoin's price a million times over its useful value, people are going to choose a coin with a smaller, realistic value for their daily transactions

Apparently you do not understand the details of Bitcoin's double-spend prevention. Bitcoin makes no attempt to choose the "correct" transaction from a double-spend. It simply accepts the first one as valid, and adds it to the Blockchain. This is the simplest way to maintain the integrity of the Blockchain - every Coin can be spent once only - by making no judgment about the behaviour of the transaction senders
These principles do not apply to customer deposits in banks

Too complicated  
All that's needed is a single address for each invoice,  
and tie the address to the invoice in the billing system  
A watch-only wallet will display every payment as it arrives at every address  
In a billing reconciliation sense, the receiving address is effectively the unique identifier for the invoice  
(As mentioned previously in this thread by Not important for the eye doctor, assuming he's only expecting a few Bitcoin payments per year ...  
As a general rule, merchant wallets should be non-deterministic  
A merchant should issue an unused address for every checkout  
Some addresses will be "wasted" when the buyer does not complete the checkout  
This address wastage creates "key gaps" in deterministic wallets,  
because a deterministic wallet always has exactly the same set of keys  
The Bitcoin key space is huge, greater than the size of the universe, so keys are never truly wasted  
The problem is that groups of unused addresses in a deterministic set make it harder to scroll through the address list looking for incoming payments  
This could probably fixed with a user-interface that allows wasted addresses (key gaps) to be marked, and not displayed  
Or ...  
Using a non-deterministic wallet allows the wasted addresses to be separated from the active addresses, or discarded entirely

All transaction outputs created after the fork are safe  
Coins are created in every transaction, not just mining  
Every transaction which spends a pre-fork coin will send the value to one or more post-fork coins  


All 54 million  
But the individual Bitcoin user only needs to spend all his pre-fork coins once  
to move the value to post-fork coins  
and the safe approach is to send them to himself  
so that if the transaction is replayed on the other chain  
he owns the post-fork replay outputs on the other chain too

Yes and no  
Seed peers are only needed when a node/wallet knows no peers when first initialised  
Most nodes run long-term, with an established list of peers they have discovered over time  
Even a new node can be manually configured with the IP address of a single known good node, and that node supplies the addresses of other nodes, etc  
If the Government is only blocking the seed list, only new nodes are affected. The Government is presumably using the list which is publicly available in the source code

Bitcoin has a 10-minute block interval  
If it is reduced to less than 10 minutes then it is not Bitcoin  
Your understanding of mining is inverted  
The purpose of mining is not to reward the miner with 12.5 Bitcoin  
It is to govern the rate of block creation to 10 minutes  
The Bitcoin Blockchain is secure from tampering because 9000+ independently operated nodes keep a full copy of the Blockchain  
There needs to be a long delay between blocks to be certain that all 9000 nodes have added the previous block to the chain before the next block arrives  
The 10-minute interval allows a good safety margin for block propagation across the entire network  
If you believe shorter block interval is a good idea, use one of the other coins - there are coins with a block interval of 2.5 minutes, or 1 minute

* the Beijing bureaucrats and the provincial bureaucrats had a nice meal and decided to defer the action indefinitely  
* the provincial bureaucrats welcomed the Beijing bureaucrats to their provinces, wished them long and prosperous lives, then sent them back to Beijing

A near-enough guess  
As Digiconomist says, not every miner is an Antminer S9  
I've pointed out at least 20 times in earlier threads that their figure of 232 Joules per Terahash is way too high, but 98 Joules per Terahash could be 10-20% low, depending on how many Avalon miners and how many Antminer S7 miners are still in operation  
Let's run this with 98, and the current blockchain.info hash rate ...  
  
21,378,194 Terahashes per second  
600 seconds per block  
21,378,194 * 600 = 12,826,916,400 Terahashes per block  
  
0.098 J/GH == 98 Joules per Terahash  
12,826,916,400 * 98 = 1,257,037,807,200 Joules per block  
52,560 blocks per year  
1,257,037,807,200 * 52,560 = 66,069,907,146,432,000 Joules per year  
which is 66 Petajoules  
3.6 Petajoules in a Terawatt hour  
Divide by 3.6, and the number matches the above ...  
18.35 Terawatt hours per year

Yes, all the value is in the coins  
And every coin is spent only once  


That's in the white paper, but has never been implemented. The concept is that if all the outputs of a transaction have been spent (in subsequent transactions), they are no longer coins, so the transaction can be trimmed from the chain - as long as a minimum amount of hashes are retained to validate the integrity of the chain back to the genesis

Centralisation of mining is a potential risk to Bitcoin  
The monopoly manufacturer of Bitcoin mining ASICs uses their own hardware to mine Bitcoin, in competition with their own customers, and manages their own mining pool  
This is a serious conflict of interest, unethical, evil  
I think Cobra is wrong  
* Bitcoin non-mining nodes are decentralised, this is more important than whether there are too few large "centralised" mining pools  
* Changing the proof-of-work hash does not solve the problem. Every hash can be implemented in an ASIC

Generating addresses in advance is the normal operation of any wallet software  


Even a HD wallet with a seed is creating multiple addresses with separate private keys. This is how Bitcoin works  
Using the bitaddress.org generator, or just creating thousands of keys from any computer's random number generator, you are creating a non-deterministic key set, which you can import into Core or Electrum, and then copy the matching addresses into your web site's payment system  
In practice a HD key set is the same as a non-deterministic key set, except for the backup requirements:  
*    using HD requires you to backup the seed  
*    using a non-deterministic key set requires you to backup all the keys, not a big deal, since they are only 32 bytes each  
There is a bug in some HD wallets where they stop working if you don't use the addresses previously generated - referred to as the key gap problem. To avoid this, use non-deterministic key sets, or read about the workaround techniques which unfreeze a wallet with a key gap problem  
Whether you use HD or non-deterministic, just remember that it is unsafe to have the private keys on your Web server

Coinbase is delaying the BCash forked coins until 2018, presumably because their systems were not ready  
And now Coinbase has announced they will supply 2X coins when the  November fork happens,  
people think this means Coinbase is a better place for their coins than their own wallets

A proper Web shopping cart for merchants,  
so they can stop using fee-sucking payment services  
No address re-use  
The wallet should be a watching-only wallet containing addresses only,  
because private keys should never be stored on a Web server  
A new address must be used for every transaction, and the address should be linked to the customer's order  
Making the receiving address unique per order allows the order system to automatically assign ever payment to the correct order  
This avoids the "please send a message stating your transaction ID" overhead incurred by many merchants  
Non-deterministic wallet to avoid the "key gap" problem  
*    Pre-generate all the keys non-deterministically off-line, then import the list of addresses into the watching wallet on the Web server  
Allow the customer to supply a receiving address for possible future refunds at time of purchase,  
because sending refunds back to the purchase address is address re-use and  
[address re-use is bad](

Terminology correction  
SHA256 algorithm is very simple  
Increasing the Bitcoin mining difficulty makes it harder, not more complex  
It's just a guessing competition  
Making it harder is trivial, just reduce the guessing target  


The bottom did not fall out. The price went down because speculators drove it too high  
The price is one variable in the profitability calculation for Bitcoin mining  
Various factors mean that the mining hash rate does not instantly follow prices changes. Mining is a medium term investment so it is unwise for miners to follow every price fluctuation when it happens  
Also, the current price decline coincides with the current delivery of new mining hardware. The hardware is always sold out, and is sold by pre-order. Miners pre-ordered the current batch 2 months ago and are now receiving their hardware. They could choose to sell them into the secondary market, but most of them have chosen to put their miners to work. If the price fall continues, a lot of miners will retire from Bitcoin over the coming weeks. The hash rate will fall

If Bitcoin creates mass non-compliance, then income tax, sales tax and company tax could collapse to zero. Every time this has been discussed here, the majority opinion is in favour of compliance, so it's unlikely to become an issue  
However, it doesn't take much imagination to build a new tax system which is immune from non-compliance (failure to report income, sales and profits). A financial analyst would spend a month developing a new system, then a 5-minute meeting would approve it

HD is arguably a benefit for beginners, because it reduces the problem of lost coins caused by failure to backup wallets  
The problem is that beginners think they have a single key and a single address  
A lot of Bitcoin articles describe Bitcoin using the words "key" and "address", without explaining that all wallets have multiple keys, and corresponding multiple addresses  
The habit of people begging for tips and donations with "please send coins to this address" reinforces the false "one address per wallet" misconception  
HD wallets also reinforce this impression, and confuse it, because users think their single key and their seed phrase are the same thing  
I've always opposed HD for security reasons, but I don't think it matters in the context of beginners' misconceptions. The main problem to solve is the "one address" misconception  
**EDIT**  
Wallet software which hides the address list is responsible for contributing to the "one address" misconception. I have Electrum on desktop and on Android. The Android version has no option to list all the addresses

BCash is still running, despite having nearly zero real transactions - excluding transactions which are just people cashing in the windfall  
BCash is running, partly because exchanges support it, and many exchanges support it only because it has replay protection  
If BTC1 gets replay protection, then it will be in the same position as BCash, barely used but straggling along, with some notional value  
Without replay protection, there is a risk that some exchanges could support BTC1 anyway, and it could straggle along, corrupting the main chain with replay transactions for months or years

Zero-conf is a bigger issue now than in the past, because full blocks mean that a transaction can take days to confirm - 23 days in January 2018. High confirmation delay is a longer opportunity for a fraudulent double spend  
Also, I'm not sure if nodes ever accepted unconfirmed double spends, but today they do not. Having done this recently - double spend to increase fee on a non-RBF transaction - the replacement transaction was rejected by several nodes with an error message about mempool conflict. One replacement was accepted after 3 days, the node removed the original transaction from its mempool and accepted the replacement. The replacement was still unconfirmed, so I tried the same again, a slightly higher fee, rejected. I tried several nodes, many rejections, until one accepted the replacement  
The point is that a non-RBF double spend is much harder, even if you circumvent the part where your wallet prevents you broadcasting it  
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong here  
RBF requires the transaction to have a change output, and to boost the fee by reducing the change amount  
This means it can't work with a one-output transaction  


This is partially true:  
  
advises that a transaction marked RBF should not be accepted by the receiver until it is confirmed, but does not change the risk analysis which makes zero-conf reasonably safe for some transactions

At the time of the transaction the price of Bitcoin was around USD400  
Input from 15aarTNL9TPStrs5ZtBHXZrh4GMtBKRmbG  
*    90.30469157 Bitcoin  
*    USD36,921.98  
Output to 38JtzBVJD1VfrikQ77J4KhuSKBhYtSFaei  
*    0.0972 Bitcoin  
*    USD39.74  
Output to 12oHXfCAgjxaixXcAirxTKiZptoGyggDZ5  
*    90.20699157 Bitcoin  
*    USD36,882.03  
Now that's clear, the answer ...  
Before the transaction  
15aarTNL9TPStrs5ZtBHXZrh4GMtBKRmbG contained one coin with 90.30469157 Bitcoin  
After the transaction  
15aarTNL9TPStrs5ZtBHXZrh4GMtBKRmbG is worth zero  
38JtzBVJD1VfrikQ77J4KhuSKBhYtSFaei contains one coin with 0.0972 Bitcoin  
*    it also has many coins from previous transactions but they are not relevant to this discussion  
12oHXfCAgjxaixXcAirxTKiZptoGyggDZ5 contains one coin with 90.20699157 Bitcoin  
The amounts involved would indicate the most likely story is that a large input  
was split into a small output and a large "change" amount  
in which case this is a transaction for USD39.74  
The "how Bitcoin works" part of the explanation ...  
Every transaction clears every input to zero  
Most transactions will contain at least one output which is a "change output"  
A man went to a restaurant,  
ate a $39.74 meal,  
paid using a $36,921.98 note  
Bitcoin destroyed the $36,921.98 note  
created a new $39.74 note  
and a new $39,882.03 note  
The restaurateur received the $39.74 note  
and the customer received the $39,882.03 note as change

Hashing algorithms are designed to compute a totally different and unpredictable hash with the tiniest change in the input value  Including the nonce in the hash calculation supports a continual repetition of hash calculations using data which changes by only one or two bits every iteration,  
while not changing the fundamental data elements at all

One of the advantages missing from your list:  
*    Bitcoin can not be censored  
According to the (probably fictional) essay about the origins of Bitcoin,  
an online casino was looking for an alternative to credit cards as a payment method  
Americans are banned from online gambling  
Some gamblers were using credit cards on online casinos, losing money, then claiming chargebacks  
The chargebacks were legitimate because of the gambling ban  
Bitcoin is censorship resistant because Bitcoin users can not be prevented from gambling,  
or from donating to politically controversial charities like Wikileaks - also banned by credit card companies

After years of failing to exploit the market for ASIC miners because they could never produce enough to meet demand and were always delaying delivery, the market turned around and now they're heavily discounting because they can't sell all their stock  
Why does a startup go to IPO?  
Because the investors want their investment back  
In many cases the investors and management know the company is on the brink of failure, and they're desperate to offload the failure to the public before the collapse

Worth mentioning that the hash rate was about 8 Exahash/sec which this issue hit mainstream a few months ago, compared to 21 today  
Also, the calculations assume no change in hash rate for the year being calculated. The hash rate will follow the Bitcoin price, more or less, but is affected by the recent 50% price increase for the next batch of S9 miners, and potentially affected by the recent China announcement promising to cancel all the favourable power contracts for Bitcoin mining farms. To date the China announcement has had no effect, so it could be delayed by a slow bureaucracy, or the bureaucracy which made the announcement might have no political power to enforce regional power contract changes - ie it may be irrelevant

You need to carefully back up your private keys  
You need to use the wallet for the ForkCoin, and be very careful not to download some cleverly named malware wallet you found with a Google search  
There needs to be an exchange offering to swap ForkCoins for Bitcoins - in the BCash split, there were 2 exchanges doing this. There might be no exchanges buying ForkCoins after the BGold split  
Use the ForkCoin wallet to spend your ForkCoins at the exchange, deposit ForkCoin to receive Bitcoin. Wait the required number of Forkchain confirmations. Withdraw your windfall Bitcoins from the exchange into your Bitcoin wallet  
After the BCash fork, there were several malware wallets claiming to swap BCash for Bitcoin, when all they actually did was steal the Bitcoins. If you use one of these wallets, you will lose your Bitcoins and your ForkCoins

That article, and this one:  
  
Most of the risks are caused by misunderstanding Bitcoin transactions, addresses, coins, address non reuse  
A lot of misunderstanding is reinforced by wallets, the way wallets hide addresses, and some wallets' re-use of addresses  
Wallets have many addresses  
Transactions have one or more inputs and one or more outputs  
A coin is a transaction output which has never been spent  
A coin can only be spent completely  
A coin can only be spent once  
An address should only be used once for receiving Bitcoin  
Address re-use is common, and strongly discouraged  
The most common transaction has one input and two outputs  
The second output is referred to as "change"  
because it is analogous to receiving change in a real-world cash transaction  
The term "change address" is confusing,  
because a change address is exactly the same as any other Bitcoin address

Second layers are only necessary in a world with only one cryptocurrency  
Bitcoin scales to about 20 tx/sec (currently 4), on chain  
Building off-chain second layers distributes transaction load into the second layer, and uses Bitcoin as a 20 tx/sec settlement layer  
This is a "solution" which addresses Bitcoin's limitation, and discards Bitcoin's benefits - immutable transaction ledger, free from interference and corrupt manipulation  
Overlaying this is a phony debate, a false dichotomy of only two choices - second layer or bigger blocks  
Another choice is the proliferation of equal Blockchains, more currencies, each with a low transaction throughput limit, but where the total transaction rate of the entire system of currencies is high enough to support any future growth, just by creating more currencies  
For this scenario, smaller blocks would be more effective

I thought this too  
So I looked at the price of the mining hardware everybody buys at the moment (Bitmain Antminer S9), talked to a few friends with a few thousand to invest, made some plans to purchase 100 S9 miners  
Searched the warehouse rentals for some sites which would fit the mining hardware at a good rental price - just bare concrete sheds  
Did some more planning, what's the power requirement?  
1400 Watts per S9, about the same as running a kettle 24/7  
Multiply by 100, that makes 140kW  
Look around for office or warehouse, or backyard shed behind someone's house which has a 140kW mains power supply  
No such animal

Rang the power company for a quote to add 140kW to the power supply of the warehouse, they ask why, I tell them I'm mining Bitcoins. They laughed for 5 minutes and hung up

Blueshyft also provide services for bitcoin.com.au, using the same retail outlets, no account signup, no ID requirements, higher fees, but apparently lower buy exchange rates - hard to be certain, since the rates shown on both sites are not strictly comparable  
Bitcoin.com.au send Bitcoin direct to your wallet, 5% fee  
There is also coin loft, which also send Bitcoin (or Ether) direct to your wallet. They sell "Flexepin vouchers" through the ePay network - retail terminals mainly used to sell mobile phone topup vouchers  
To get Bitcoin through coin loft, go to a shop, buy a Flexepin voucher, enter the voucher number at coinloft.com.au, receive Bitcoins in your wallet. Like bitcoin.com.au, coin loft has no account signup, but requires your phone number, and asks for ID proof with the first transaction. There is a $5 fee to redeem a voucher  
My current preference is the BitRocket ATM, more convenient than the Blueshyft and ePay options, because no ID or phone number is required, insert cash, receive Bitcoin in your wallet  
BitRocket only have a handful of ATMs in Australia. Luckily, 3 of them are close to me. For everyone else, the Blueshyft and Flexepin options might be more convenient

You can not, because among all the padding, there is one argument which is obviously true  


Already Government is strangling cryptocurrency exchanges with KYC rules  
Further regulation will add more and more restrictions to the point of exchange between fiat currency and cryptocurrency  
More and more show trials of Localbitcoins small traders will be publicised in the media  
The only counter to this is that eventually Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be useful in their own right, with no need to convert to fiat currency  
When we can all have our wages paid in cryptocurrency and buy and sell everything with cryptocurrency, then the "cryptocurrencies unconvertible into anything useful" argument disappears, because Bitcoin itself will be "useful"

Google "rainbow tables"  
And restrict your searches to public keys and addresses which exist on the Blockchain  
There could be a slight benefit to focusing on address re-use, because an unspent coin is just an address and an amount  
A spent coin is a transaction input, includes the public key, not just the address. Multi-use addresses will give you access to the public keys of unspent coins  
Public keys, not private keys, but that puts you 2 steps closer to the private key, compared to only knowing the address
One example of a person deliberately exposing a private key:

@_date: 2017-10-31 12:57:25
Correct  
A wallet created from an imported address must be completely separate from the HD wallet  
This is discussed in the Electrum documentation:  
  
There are two failure modes here:  
1. import the key into an existing HD wallet, and lose the key when the wallet is re-created from seed at some future time  
1. import the key into a "special wallet that does not have a seed", and then forget to backup the special wallet  
If maintaining 2 separate wallets is too hard,  
or if making good backups of the special wallet is too hard,  
then sweeping is safer than importing

You're right  
Bitcoin depends on the impossibility of a malicious conspiracy between a large number of nodes, and on the implied cooperation of all nodes, operating independently. This "trust in numbers" effectively prevents malicious nodes, since they would be quickly exposed by their inability to serve hash-verifiable blocks

The Electrum cold storage page is the best guide, then work out how to get Electrum, plus other required software, onto the Pi OS before installing, or by the risky and time-consuming method of transferring software as needed from an online PC to the Zero using a USB storage device  
From memory, you need  
* the Pi Camera connected to the Zero  
* Raspbian Lite  
* Pi camera software  
* qrencode to create QR images  
* imagemagick to display QR images on console  
* zbar-tools to decode QR images  
* Electrum  
* python 3 is required for Electrum - can't remember if the current Raspbian Stretch Lite has python2 or python3 or both  
Before installing, you load Raspbian Lite onto the microSD, then mount it on an online PC, download the .deb files for the extra packages, download Electrum  
Then boot the Zero and configure apt to use a local repository, instructions at debian.org  
apt-get install all the packages from the local repository - qrencode, imagemagick etc  
The general principle of operation is to run a watching-only Electrum wallet online, and use this to create unsigned transactions. Then display the transaction as a QR and point the Pi camera at the QR to import the unsigned transaction into the Zero. Use Electrum cold to sign the transaction on the Zero, convert the signed transaction into a QR code and display the QR on screen using imagemagick. Point a camera at the Zero's screen to import the signed transaction to the online PC and broadcast it to the Bitcoin network  
Possibly slightly easier with full Raspbian including the Pixel X-Window GUI, but the Zero is sluggish with a GUI  
If you're not paranoid about the malware risk of using a USB storage device, then the cameras and QR codes are not necessary

Blockchain pruning was implemented 2 years ago  
  
Pruning as described in Satoshi's White Paper  
  


has not been implemented  
This section of the White Paper describes a pruning method which involves removing old, fully-spent transactions from their blocks by replacing a pruned transaction with its hash  
The Merkle-tree method of hashing pairs of transaction hashes (and pairs of Merkle hashes) means that transaction pruning does not change the Merkle root hash in the block header, thereby retaining the ability to validate the block  
Pruning only fully-spent transactions has no impact on the verification of new transactions. A transaction output can only be spent once, therefore no fully-spent transactions can ever be linked to new transactions  
The Satoshi pruning proposal does not require a hard fork. Satoshi-pruned nodes can operate in the same network as fully pruned nodes and unpruned nodes  
It is waiting for someone to volunteer the coding hours required

1. someone who visited your home saw the paper wallet sitting on a coffee table and took a photo while you were out of the room  
1. you imported the paper wallet into a computer wallet, discarded the paper and someone finds the paper wallet in your trash and steals your coins

Not systematic, not planned. Miners follow a profitability calculation which encourages them individually to move from chain to chain and back again every 2-3 days. Since the calculation is the same for everybody, it is not a conspiracy nor a coincidence that many miners make identical decisions at the same time  
Because the hashing capacity is swinging from chain to chain several times between difficulty adjustments, it causes a distortion in your calculation of difficulty vs hash rate. The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment does not know about fluctuations, it only knows the total time required to create the previous 2016 blocks  
The BCash so-called "Emergency Difficulty Adjustment" mechanism is a factor in the profitability calculation. It periodically distorts the profitability calculation in favour of BCash. Without it, there might be nobody mining BCash at all  


Only profitable at the 2-cent rate in inner Mongolia  
The business model of adding more hashing power to Bitcoin mining has a fundamental flaw. Every extra ASIC causes a proportional increase in difficulty, automatically reducing the rate-of-return for the investment cost of the ASIC - a self-defeating investment  
At the moment, only the speculator bubble makes mining profitable. Too much extra hashing power makes mining a losing investment, but the price increase of Bitcoin covers the losses and delivers profit  
Until the price stops increasing  
The next driver for mining investment will be when mining becomes a back-door opportunity for exporting wealth out of China  
With China closing exchanges, and regulating the purchase of Bitcoin to small amounts, mining will become an indirect way for wealthy Chinese to acquire large amounts of Bitcoin  
This will create a price discrepancy in China - higher prices relative to the freer markets in the West  
Higher Bitcoin prices in China will make mining profitable only in China, whatever the electricity price

Bitcoin mining is self-adjusting  
Your calculation ignores the fact that lower profitability removes miners from  Bitcoin, reduces the hash rate, and proportionally reduces the electricity cost  
If 10 Exahashes/sec burns $5k of electricity to produce 1 Bitcoin, then 5 Exahashes only burns $2.5k of electricity  
This means that if the Bitcoin price eventually falls to $2, then it is still profitable to mine it because the hash rate will be low enough to cost less than $2 of electricity

Incorrect  
Each word represents 11 bits, because 2^11 = 2048  
In a 12-word seed phrase, only the last 4 bits is the checksum  
Read the documentation  
  
This means if the last 2 words of 12 are lost there are 18 bits missing, so the brute force required is 2^18 max, or 2^17 average

You can not legally ask the bank to reverse a bank transfer when there has not been fraud

Aside from the question of the appropriate price level, your original question carries a false assumption  
You're asking about price collapse, but your wording is Bitcoin collapse  
These are not the same  
Bitcoin continues to function as a currency whether the price is $4000 or $200 or $2 or $0.0025  
My point is that Bitcoin as a currency is more useful at lower prices,  
so questions about price collapse are separate from whether Bitcoin collapses  
Articles on Facebook?

If all the world is bots and all bots are self-learning, and they eventually learn past the initial goals programmed into them by humans, they might all converge to an identical strategy and stalemate  
This would not be a bad thing, because it would mean that Bitcoin at a fixed price will be more useful as a currency for buying and selling goods and services on the Internet. There will still be trading volume, but no price fluctuation  
I doubt it  
Assuming humans ever get to the point where they allow self-learning bots to do anything more sophisticated than fine-tune a Web search page ranking algorithm ...  
A world of self-learning bots would diverge, according to the mathematics of chaos, or the butterfly effect. The competition would be (in a digital sense) more violent than all the human wars of all history  
This is a far distant future. I note that IBM advertises Watson's role assisting a Formula 1 team, one of the teams which rarely  wins any races. Humans will dominate bots for some years to come, possibly forever

Not a trader, but have a passing involvement with a small non-profit which accepts Bitcoin for donations - since April 2017  
They tell me that the delay between receiving donations and spending has net them a 20% profit during this period  
Maybe this shows that the price/block congestion/fees conditions which affect people's decisions to use Bitcoin for donations mean that donations are more likely just before a price increase  
Or maybe it's just that the price has been on an upward trend since May 2017  
Note that no donations arrived during the period Bitcoin was horribly congested, and that this coincided with the price range of $19k to $14k

bitcoind and Electrum CLI command lists here:  
  
The decryption password is bitcoin  
The Electrum command list is reasonably well documented in that every command has a help option  
The annoying part of that is that you need to download and install it to read this help - one command at a time  
If you have the spare time, it's very rewarding  
    electrum help payto  
    electrum payto --fee 0  ...  
bitcoind, the same but the help is slightly less informative  
And there are random tutorials in popular Bitcoin forums which illustrate the full depth of some of the CLI commands for controlling bitcoind  
For example:   
Looking at the "bitcoind createrawtransaction" example in that tutorial, the construction of the parameters is a torture of punctuation marks  
With the right learning curve, and wrapper scripts to avoid manually balancing '"[{"":"","":""}]"' both options are equivalent  
Electrum's learning curve is much shorter  
Don't dismiss the RPC option too quickly. There are commandline tools for sending commands and parameters to an RPC server without having to deal directly with JSON syntax. These things are outside my experience, but looming in my near future  
Re the Electrum python console part of your original post, I've looked at it, never used it. Seems to be a convoluted way of running the same commands that are available at the normal terminal prompt

It doesn't matter how many times you repeat it, this is false  
The last word is 11 bits  
The checksum is 4 bits  
You still have to brute force the first 7 bits of the last word  
Assuming 12 words ...  
Also assuming no passphrase ...  
You need to brute-force the last 18 bits of the 128-bit entropy, use SHA256 to calculate the 4-bit checksum, hash the 132 bits to create the xprv, generate the xpub, generate a set of addresses, then test the addresses against the user's address list  
So far the user has not stated the number of words in the seed, which derivation path his wallet uses (hasn't stated which wallet), or supplied any addresses

If a low tx fee delays the transaction confirmation, then the merchant can submit a transaction spending the output of the unconfirmed transaction, sending the coins to himself.

Unlucky timing. The fee is 6666 Satoshis, fairly high, so it should confirm soon  
RBF: replace by fee  
CPFP: child pays for parent  
RBF is the simplest way to hurry an unconfirmed transaction  
If the original does not have a RBF flag, then CPFP can be an option, but only if you control the key of one of the transaction outputs. In this case your transaction has one output. If you are sending to yourself, then you can spend this output (probably to yourself) with a high-enough fee, and the unconfirmed transaction will get confirmed together with the CPFP transaction  
If you are not sending to yourself, maybe the recipient can hurry the transaction with his own CPFP transaction - if he wants to pay the additional fee  


The other comments have explained mempools and default expiry time. Every node has its own mempool. If a node's mempool is full, it will discard the oldest low-fee transactions to make room for new transactions. This can happen any time. Otherwise the current default expiry time is 336 hours (14 days). Any node operator can use a shorter or longer expiry time  
What stops you re-sending with a higher fee?  
Some wallets will not allow an unconfirmed transaction to be re-sent. Expiry rules in individual wallets vary  
If your wallet allows re-sending, then the node (or nodes) you broadcast the replacement transaction to will usually reject the replacement with an error - transaction already in mempool  
If you spend a bit of time experimenting with sending to different nodes, you might find one node which has already expired your unconfirmed transaction. But then, when that node propagates the replacement transaction to its neighbours, they will respond with "transaction already in mempool"  
After waiting for most nodes to expire the transaction, you can re-send it  
If you don't re-send, because you paid in some other channel, you should send the Bitcoin to yourself. If any miner (or anybody) has saved a copy of your unconfirmed transaction, that person can re-send the transaction any time, even years later. If all the transaction's inputs are still unspent (unlikely, but possible), then the transaction will be valid, and you will get a surprise. You only need to spend one of the transaction's 6 inputs to prevent this surprise

You're past the gap limit. To avoid endlessly searching all future addresses, HD wallets stop after some pre-specified number. You've chosen address 228, which is a long way past the gap limits of HD wallets  
Gap limit is a defect in the the concept of HD address sets, and key sets. Most people are not affected by the problem. There are workarounds: increase the gap limit; send a transaction to yourself using the last address in the gap range

You are buying one output of one transaction, where only you control the private key linked to the address stored in the transaction output  
Your exclusive control of that private key ensures that only you can spend the Satoshis stored in that transaction output  


coin, not coins  
Each unspent output is a single coin  


Not moving coins  
Moving value by destroying coins and making one or more new coins with the same value  
You are changing one coin from unspent to spent, or setting its value to zero, destroying it  
At the same time you are adding a new transaction to the ledger with one or more new coins  
**EDIT**  
It would be more interesting to ask this:  
The Blockchain is an immutable ledger,  
can only be appended to,  
existing blocks and transactions can never be modified  
Preventing double-spending requires knowing that a coin has already been spent  
If you can not update the coin's transaction, how can you know if a coin is unspent or spent?

Network speed is not significant for block propagation  
Propagation delay is mostly compute time - the amount of time it takes each node to verify a new block before passing it on to its neighbour nodes  
The time for propagation to all nodes must be a lot less than 10 minutes because the block interval is often a lot less than 10 minutes  
If you want shorter block intervals, use Litecoin (2.5 minutes) or Dogecoin (1 minute)

Yes, Bitcoin miners occasionally build blocks using transactions which are not in the mempool  


Sure  


Bitcoin nodes would not reject the block, because fees are only checked before mining - minimum fee rules are not part of consensus  
Regarding BCash, you should read how their so-called zero-conf works. I'm not sure whether the extra pre-mining validation they've implemented would prevent previously unseen transactions being added to a new block  
I would guess they've never considered the possibility, and it should work fine  
The main thing preventing this type of vandalism is that even a coin as insignificant as BCash can only be mined in pools, and individual miners (pool members) do not select transactions for their blocks. Only pool managers build blocks

A divisibility hard fork would probably invent a new name for the lowest denomination. I would call it a Chaum  
The sensible way to increase Bitcoin divisibility would be to change the transaction version number for future transactions  
Transactions before the change have Satoshi amounts in their outputs - how Bitcoin works today  
Transactions after the change would have their value in Chaums  
A transaction could then have inputs pointing back to a mix of old and new transaction outputs. Wallets and nodes would need to be coded to recognise that there are 100 Chaums in a Satoshi when they process such a mixed input transaction. The transaction version number would indicate whether the output amounts are Satoshis or Chaums

Sorry to bore you with the truth  
Spent nuclear fuel consists of many different isotopes with varying half-lives and toxicity. The isotopes with 20-30 year half-life are physically too hot to handle or process for 80 years. After 80 years, all the waste, including Plutonium 239 which is extremely toxic and has a half-life of 24000 years can be disposed of by encasing it in synthetic rock, an extremely stable ceramic material  
This technology was invented more than 30 years ago  
It is not currently in use because even the oldest nuclear waste is still hot  
What has not been invented is humans with the intelligence and ethics to pay for the disposal process 80 years after the waste is created. Instead, we are planning to poison 8000 future generations of humans by discarding Plutonium 239 into the environment, the water system and food system

Raising the block size substantially reduces the node count, making Bitcoin insecure  
Blocks will fill up, even after increasing the size  
This means the larger blocks only temporarily reduce block congestion and permanently reduce Bitcoin's security
Centralised payment processors censor transactions  
Visa and PayPal have huge lists of banned transactions  
Bitcoin was developed to be a payment system without transaction censorship  
Bitcoin transactions can not be censored because the transaction ledger is distributed to thousands of independently operated nodes  
Increasing the block size increases the cost of running a node, disproportionately  
The number of nodes would fall substantially  
The current block size is already large  
Blocks should be limited to about 200kbytes

A light (SPV) node needs to connect to a SPV server  
The SPV server needs to be a full node  
You need to download the entire Blockchain to initialise a node - pruned or not. Pruned nodes can not serve old blocks to new nodes  
Hypothetically, the community might agree to transaction pruning and  coin expiry. Then, as transactions become fully spent, they can be deleted from their blocks, replaced by their hashes, and adjacent pairs of hashes can be replaced by their Merkle branch hashes. If all the transactions in a block are fully spent, the block becomes pruned back to its header. If old UTXOs are allowed to expire (coin expiry), then lost coins (and hoarded coins) will not prevent old transactions from being pruned. Eventually, every transaction becomes fully spent if it reaches coin expiry age, and then the oldest blocks have no transactions in them. The size of the Blockchain then becomes constant, equal to the number of blocks defined by coin expiry age, and fairly small  
Then you would ask the inverse question ...  
Is it OK to run a node which still has a full archive of every transaction since genesis?

The normal block propagation time is less than 1 minute  


Shorter block intervals cause more orphan blocks  
This is the reason Litecoin abandoned 1 minute and increased to 2.5 minutes  
Orphan risk is not an issue by itself. An orphan block will grow to an orphan branch until all the nodes propagating the so-called orphans have resynchronised. A node with an orphan branch eventually discards the orphan blocks and replaces them by downloading the correct blocks from its neighbours. If a lot of nodes have orphans more than a few blocks deep, the time those nodes require to resynchronise could become significantly longer than the normal block propagation time. If the block interval is too short, and there are many nodes with long orphan branches, then block propagation could become delayed by nodes never being able to catch up. If the Blockchain gets a backlog of confirmed blocks not being propagated, it quickly becomes useless  
A shorter block interval  
*    increases the rate of orphans  
*    decreases the time available for nodes to resynchronise if they get orphans  


The reason for having a large time buffer is to prevent a backlog ever occurring. The latency effect of orphan branches is cumulative, not linear - delays pile on top of delays. The exact point at which it runs away is not predictable, can not be accurately calculated. There is no empirical basis for calculating the optimum block interval  
Nobody knows how to operate a test Blockchain which mimics the traffic patterns of the real chain, while arbitrarily inserting orphans just to measure resynchronisation delays  
In the mainnet Blockchain, orphans are now extremely rare, so it is not possible to retrospectively analyse the latency impact of real orphans  
Craig Wright has a point. The latency impact of orphans is non-linear. Most people who question the 10-minute block interval are unaware of this, or they only understand linear mathematics  


Not important. There is already a good pruning design in the white paper. Chain size will eventually drive the development and implementation of Satoshi's pruning method. If the chain grows faster, this innovation will come sooner

It is not necessary to store full history on the Blockchain. Satoshi's design (but not his code) contains a pruning method which deletes fully-spent transactions. If the Blockchain takes too long to initialise, this pruning method will help. By removing fully-spent transactions, the UTXO build goes much faster, and can be made even faster using a sorting technique instead of the current transaction-by-transaction technique

*    average cycle time, the time from a customer buying Bitcoin with fiat to make an online purchase, the customer spending the Bitcoin, then the merchant selling Bitcoin for fiat, estimate 24 hours  
*    average transaction value, estimate USD80  
*    average transactions per cycle, current daily transaction volume is 320000, estimate 420000

You gave someone your blockchain.com wallet login details, maybe some time ago, because they promised you a gift, they told you the wallet is secure as long as you keep the wallet password secret, and after leaving the gift in your wallet, they told you to change your login password. You changed your login password  
What really happened?  
You allowed some stranger to login to your blockchain.info account and make a copy of your wallet's recovery words because they offered a gift  
When you put 2.4 Bitcoin into the wallet, they used the recovery words to create the private key and make a Bitcoin transaction to send your Bitcoin to themselves  
They don't need to access your blockchain.com account or your phone because you gave them all your future private keys

This calculation is obviously false because it does not account for the fact that the difficulty level increases whenever the hashing capacity increases  
Figure this into your economy of Bitcoin mining:  
(Excluding fees)  
No matter how much hashing capacity is mining Bitcoin at any minute, only one block will be mined every 10 minutes on average, and the reward amount is known for years in advance for every single block  
I realise you're attempting to invent a formula for the fiat value of mining rewards relative to the fiat cost of mining, but my point is that your understanding of the relationship is reversed  
Why would miners add more and more ASICs into their pools if the difficulty adjustment automatically reduces the rate of return of each ASIC in proportion to the number of new ASICs?  
Why would they? Why **ARE** they?  
Because the price is increasing  
The price is driven by a speculator bubble  
Every time the price increases $1000, the block reward increases by $12500, so miners add more ASICs to soak up the additional fiat profits. The difficulty increases in proportion, the cost increases in proportion, the profit stays the same  
As I said, your cost-reward analysis is inverted  
A more correct analysis would state that the amount of mining increases in proportion to price increases  




Some time in 2014  
Some behaviour might indicate that the monopoly ASIC manufacturer has been operating at a loss for a year or more, but their accounts are secret, so we can never know  
The other flaw in your analysis is that its calculation is valid for Bitcoin at any price. Bitcoin continues forever generating a block every 600 seconds, inventing 12.5 new coins from hashing (until the halvening). This is true whether the hash rate is 1 GHash or 12 EHash, whether the price is $2 or $6000

No such thing as an integer of 51 bits in any programming language  
If an integer is too big for 32 bits, then it is defined as 64 bits  
Why care about 13 bits?  


The amount of each transaction output is stored as a 64-bit integer count of Satoshis. There is no BTC and cents. Don't make things up  


It's not float. Why makes things up?  


This is also incorrect. The amount is stored in the output of a transaction when the transaction is created. When the UTXO is spent, the amount is retrieved from the output. The amount is **not** stored in the spending transaction. That would be redundant

The point is that there are two main causes of Bitcoin loss  
A USB Flash drive is a good solution for theft prevention  
But most Bitcoin losses are caused by negligence - forgotten passwords, backup failure  
USB Flash drives are notorious for being unreadable in this situation:  
Sitting on a shelf just in case it's needed, and then being 100% unreadable when it is needed  
This is old, pre-Bitcoin, but a good example of this issue:  
  
Also discusses the problem of ink fading on a paper backup  
As you said already, never online  
The solution to the problem discussed in that old mailing list thread is not to argue about which medium is most reliable for backups, but to recognise that every medium is unreliable. My preference is DVD. They break too, but usually they remain partially readable, unlike Flash-ROM  
The strategy to protect important backups is to have multiple copies and to check them frequently enough that a failed backup can be replaced  
So I have 4 copies on DVD - actually since Bitcoin keys are so tiny, I have thousands of copies on each DVD, because this makes the data recoverable if the disk is partially damaged - and I check all 4 DVDs every 3 months. Any read failures are discarded and replaced with a copy from one of the good backups  
If I was using paper backups, I would check the paper every 6 months, for insect damage, moisture damage or fading  
Flash-ROM, more copies and check them all monthly  
HDD, more expensive and very reliable for years, would check yearly

Someone decided to donate $5 to bitcoin.org and keep $130 in a wallet for other spending purposes ...  
  
Two transactions:  
2017-08-29 received 0.031 BTC from 13zkQ2cBgqt3PWuoYtQn1WPw4wD3TgChcv  
2018-09-0 sent 0.00104512 BTC to 1GwV7fPX97hmavc6iNrUZUogmjpLPrPFoE  
leaving 0.02993488 BTC change which goes to 1PLJeRepetRj1xLRrv36BDLkJUQvJGAmqR  
This generous person's wallet has 2 addresses:  
*    19ayQRrv2TD4P9px7QydrL6M1SxzQVXbgg  
    *    balance 0 BTC  
*    1PLJeRepetRj1xLRrv36BDLkJUQvJGAmqR  
    *    balance 0.02993488 BTC

USA?  
You only need to search the Web for 2 minutes to find those cases where local Federal agents signed up with localbitcoins, identified the biggest localbitcoins seller in the local area, made a few in-person cash purchases over time, casually mentioned using the Bitcoin to buy drugs, and then arrested the Bitcoin seller for money laundering and failing to register as a money services business  
The Fed tells the judge that he told the Bitcoin seller he was using the Bitcoin to deal drugs. This gets extra jail time for the Bitcoin seller, even if he's not found guilty of money laundering  
If you're not selling Bitcoin as a business, then these jackboots are not interested in you. It might be wise to refuse to sell to any buyer who openly tells you he's buying drugs with your Bitcoin, because he could be a lying Federal agent trying to frame you as a money launderer  
Also be aware of the case where the seller agreed to sell $9200 worth of Bitcoin to a Fed, then the Fed handed him $14500, which then allowed the Fed to claim the seller was failing to report a cash transaction over $10,000 to FinCEN

Fees are calculated per byte  
Whether your transaction is $1 or $1 million, the amount of fee you pay is dependent on whether the transaction is 200 bytes or 1200 bytes, and how many Satoshis per byte you choose to pay  


Definitely  
The confirmation delay changes from day to day and can be monitored in several places. My personal favourite is this one:  
  
When the fuzzy red worm turns down, use lower fees  
Last week, I had a $20 transaction arrive with a 4-cent fee, confirmed after 15 hours  
Since then, I monitored a transaction with a fee of 5 Satoshis per byte, and another one with 1 Satoshi per byte, discussed in this subreddit  
Both transactions confirmed in 3 days  
The pool of unconfirmed transactions is much bigger today than when those transactions were created

@_date: 2018-02-21 10:48:35
A very long explanation which fails to answer the question you were asked  
First, note that value and price are not the same  
This discusses value  
All the Blockchain currencies (not the centralised cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, Iota and similar) all have the features you describe, therefore they all have potentially the same value  
The value is in the ability to perform transactions which would otherwise be impossible, because some transactions are impossible or undesirable using credit cards or other centralised payment services, because cash is a useful tool to avoid centralised payment services in the real world, but not practical on the network. As a cash analogue for network transactions, cryptocurrencies enable some transactions which would otherwise not happen. The currencies' value is the net economic benefit of these transactions  
You were asked why a new Coin has less value than Bitcoin  
I would ask if Litecoin has less value than Bitcoin  
Given that most cryptocurrency merchants accept both these coins, they have the same value for enabling cash-analogue network transactions  
Back to the original question, the value of a new coin  
Immediately it is created, its value is zero, because it has no support from merchants, therefore has no role in the marketplace  of cash-analogue network transactions. Over time, it may achieve acceptance from merchants, and then its value is the same as Bitcoin  


Litecoin is the same tech  
Dogecoin is the same tech  
Bitcoin can be copied again and again, thousands of times. Every new Coin and Blockchain created this way has all the same revolutionary tech, and therefore the same value as Bitcoin  
Bitcoin has slightly more value because you can buy it more easily from ATMs, but not for much longer. I visited my local Bitcoin ATM today, and bought 0.97 Litecoins  
Bitcoin used to have more value because the large exchanges like Coinbase only sold Bitcoin. Now Coinbase sells Litecoin as well as one of the centralised currencies and one of the scam forks  
Your argument reduces to - Bitcoin is older and more popular, therefore more valuable. Even this is questionable  
In Jan 2018, Bitcoin was so popular that people were waiting weeks or paying $25 fees for transaction confirmation. Litecoin and Dogecoin certainly had more value during this period  
Over time, first mover advantage diminishes, especially in the digital world. If the next copyCoin created out of Bitcoin code has 200kByte blocks, it could dominate cryptocurrencies for decades, leaving Bitcoin as a historical (very fond) memory. Bitcoin will not die, just become very small

BetterHash addresses this issue by allowing miners to choose the transactions in their blocks. This relegates the pool's role to measuring the hashing contributions of the members and correctly distributing the rewards

Assuming this mystery is actually worth pursuing, the clues make the following story:  
For some reason, OP could not create a wallet (was in Iraq, not enough bandwidth)  
On the last day of 2010, Michael Hendrix set up a small Bitcoin exchange for customers to buy Bitcoin from him using PayPal. The service was named Coinpal  
OP claims Hendrix helped him buy Bitcoin by supplying a "paper wallet" and then sending Bitcoin to the address  
The paper wallet wasn't printed on paper, it was a Bitcoin key pair, sent by email  
Presumably, this is where GPG comes in  
To securely send the key pair and address, Hendrix encrypted, then told OP to use GPGtools (a MacOS variant of GnuPG) to decrypt it  


Exactly right  
This is where things get murky  
There's a nice paradox here: to receive the Bitcoin key pair from Hendrix, OP would first have had to generate a GPG key pair and send the public key to Hendrix  
OP claims to have no memory of using GPGtools. This creates a dead end, unless someone wants to find the OP's GPG keyring files for him, without exposing the private  
Then, where is the Bitcoin key pair? Is it still encrypted? If not, we do not care about the GPG part anyway - nothing to decrypt  
Assume we can ignore the GPG part, because it's likely OP used GPGtools once to decrypt the email, and then stored the decrypted Bitcoin key pair on his laptop. The file names will be whatever Hendrix named them when he generated the keys before mailing them. OP says he has a file called private.key  This seems reasonable  
If this story is real, there will be a file maybe called address.txt, and possibly one called public.key  
The big inconsistency is in the earlier post where OP claims private.key looks like this  


This is where the story breaks down  
In the other thread, someone points out that the "key" appears to be random keyboard mashing  
To me, it looks like the OP is trying to show a string which looks like the contents of his file, but he's changed it for the purposes of discussion  
Unfortunately, OP doesn't see that his file is hexadecimal, so his changes have mangled it beyond recognition - imagine the above string where all the alphabetical chars are [a-f]  
It's not a Bitcoin private key, obviously it's too long  
The zeros near the start and the long string of zeros in the middle indicate this is a Bitcoin transaction in hex format. The length is about right for a transaction
Example:   


The letdown:  
Why would a file containing a Bitcoin transaction in hex format be named private.key?  
Also, as pointed out in my other comment, Hendrix launched Coinpal on the last day of 2010. OP is claiming his file is dated 2010 (does not give the exact date, why?). If this was a Coinpal purchase, it would be 2011  
These two inconsistencies justify my hoax claim  
There are other possible explanations, including the OP's poor memory. Waiting for the OP to provide more clues - the exact date of the files, whether the private.key file is hexadecimal [0-9,a-f], his interaction with Hendrix. Hendrix seems like a friendly, helpful person, is probably still active somewhere in the Bitcoin world  
I'm unlikely to believe there's any possible explanation for a file named private.key containing a Bitcoin transaction

Mostly they are, but the consensus mechanism assumes they are not. Every transaction in a new block is validated by every node **after mining**  


The purpose of proof-of-work is to impose a 10-minute average delay between blocks, and to do so much work during that period that it is nearly impossible to replace even a recent block, and impossible to replace more than about 4 blocks  
Validation is performed by all nodes after the miner sends the new block to its neighbour nodes  
Transactions ...  
Every input signature is checked. Every input is checked to ensure it is spending a coin which exists, and which hasn't been spent already. The input amounts and output amounts of a transaction are compared. Outputs must not be greater than inputs  
Blocks ...  
Every transaction hash is calculated. A Merkle tree of transaction hashes is calculated and the Merkle root hash in the block header is checked. The header hash of the previous block is calculated and compared with the "previous block header hash" element in the new block's header. The header hash of the new block is calculated, and checked to ensure it is lower than the current mining target hash  
If any check fails, the entire block is rejected by the node, and the block is not propagated to other nodes

The public key is missing from this workflow

Roger sent 0.01177228 to 1MUwKYG4pAehTpjbtgLvixXTbHZvqxGxfM  
now owns 0.01177228 Bitcoins  
A few months later decides to buy a new GPU,  
and finds a bargain GTX1080 for sale for 0.00576000 Bitcoins  
The GPU shop tells to send 0.00576000 to this address:

presses some buttons to make his wallet send 0.00576000 to 1HyKSxdYHVuXfJyPvgSoXHyfb9tnswU1HP  
wallet uses 1MUwKYG4pAehTpjbtgLvixXTbHZvqxGxfM  
and splits 0.01177228 into 0.00576000 and 0.00564796  
0.00576000 goes to 1HyKSxdYHVuXfJyPvgSoXHyfb9tnswU1HP (the GPU shop) to pay for the GTX1080  
wallet makes a new address to receive 0.00564796 change:  
1P1dY8Dk3JppkFR3XbJShvXzcxL7tVop4f  
Transaction complete:  
wallet  
*    1MUwKYG4pAehTpjbtgLvixXTbHZvqxGxfM was 0.01177228, is now zero

Bitcoin's "timestamping" isn't about recording the time, but about establishing the order in which transactions occurred. The Blockchain can never be updated, can only be appended. This defines whether A happened before B, which is more important than recording the times A and B actually occurred

I had an idea recently  
Some programmers have acquired low-level coding instructions for the GPU in the Broadcom SoaC used in the Raspberry Pi, information which was previously secret. They are working on building some coding libraries for fast fourier transforms, to manipulate audio waves  
A quick Google tells me there is a FFT hashing algorithm called SWIFFT. So maybe it would be cool to make a crypto using SWIFFT, and tell people to mine it using the GPU in a Raspberry Pi. That night I had a nightmare about shortages and massive price increases because millions of crypto miners are buying up the world supply of Raspberry Pi  
Now I'm reading magazine articles about the world-wide shortages and 100% price increases for GTX1080 and RX480 cards

I'm talking about pruning transactions, as specified in the white paper, not the half-baked block pruning implemented a few years ago  
Today, node initialisation has to store every output in the UTXO set, and then delete it when processing a spending transaction. This is why you have to process the entire Blockchain to initialise it - to inefficiently build the UTXO set  
If fully spent transactions are removed from their blocks, unnecessary add-then-delete processes are eliminated  


Very little verification is done during node initialisation. The initialisation time is dominated by the UTXO build. Even so, the calculation/verification of the Merkle root hash in a block header is faster if fully-spent transactions are removed and replaced with their hashes

Self-adjusting block interval  
When everything is running smoothly, when there are no orphan chain branches causing nodes to re-syncronise their Blockchains, a Bitcoin block propagates around the node network in a matter of seconds, less than a minute  
An algorithm is being developed to detect when at least 90% of nodes are in sync, and then temporarily reduce the mining difficulty to reduce the block interval to 30 seconds, and also increase it back to 10 minutes if any congestion appears in the node network

Expedia is too lazy, too incompetent to implement their own Bitcoin wallet. They never really accepted Bitcoin  
Expedia used to use BitPay to process Bitcoin transactions. BitPay introduced a hostile invoice format and forced it on all their merchants and customers. Expedia cancelled their BitPay service when customers complained about the BitPay invoice and also BitPay's extortionate "network fee"
@_date: 2019-09-17 16:49:02


We influence it now, by pointing out BitPay's flaws - the hostile invoice format, the extortionate so-called network fee, transaction censorship - and by pointing out the self-hosting alternatives  
Apart from the silly invoice format and the fake network fee, BitPay isn't the problem. The problem is that too many merchants see Bitcoin as just a variant of PayPal and assume they have to pay fees to a third-party gateway service  
Adoption requires merchants to use their own wallets. Merchants who avoid learning about Bitcoin and take the easy path - BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, CoinGate, CoinPayments, Blockonomics - can be excluded from the definition of adoption. Where possible, Bitcoin users can contact these merchants and advise them that Bitcoin is a person-to-person currency, that they should not use a third-party processor, they should implement their own Bitcoin wallet  
Bitcoin users can use  to find merchants who have their own wallets  
The other piece of education is to inform merchants that BitPay's service is **two separate functions** - payment gateway, Bitcoin to fiat conversion. These two functions work better if separated. The merchant can operate his own wallet, and (separately) can sell his Bitcoin using a Bitcoin exchange as often as necessary to cover his fiat expenses and minimise the risk of Bitcoin price fluctuations

All this thanks The OP appears to be confused about the definition of nonce, difficulty and target  
The OP appears to be confused about hashing algorithms, and the purpose of the nonce in the Bitcoin SHA256 hash calculation ...  
*    Hashing algorithms, like SHA256, are designed to produce a different result, **an unpredictable result**, with the tiniest change to the input parameter  
Bitcoin mining means creating a hash of the important contents of a block  
To prevent blocks being created too quickly,  
Bitcoin requires the value of the hash to be less than the target  
The whitepaper refers to "the hash begins with a number of zero bits"  
The target is not implemented by the number of leading zero bits, since this can only change by a power of 2  
Instead the target is an integer with a minimum value - the same concept as leading zeros, but with a finer degree of adjustment  
As others already posted in this thread, the nonce is just a counter  
Its only purpose is to change the SHA256 input parameter by a tiny amount in order to create a completely different hash  
All the miners in the Bitcoin mining network compete in a brute force hashing race, continuously incrementing their nonces until one discovers a hash below the target - the winner  
The winner's block gets sent to the node network to be added to the Blockchain, and the winner's mining pool gets the block reward and all the transaction fees  


Mining discovers a hash with a value below target every 10 minutes on average  
*    8 trillion hashes per second for 600 seconds  
Every 2016 blocks, the target is adjusted  
*    If the previous 2016 blocks took more than 20160 minutes, the target number increases to make mining easier  
*    If the previous 2016 blocks took less than 20160 minutes, the target number decreases to make mining harder  
The adjustment is proportional to the amount of time taken to mine the previous 2016 blocks, relative to the "target" time of 20160 minutes  
"Difficulty" is used as a jargon term to describe the target in the inverse  
That is, decreasing target means increasing difficulty, and vice versa  
And for some reason, the Bitcoin statistical sites all quote difficulty, not current target

Your proposal is based on several fallacies about the concentration of Bitcoin mining, and the ability to leverage concentration for censorship. Most important is that you assume some Chinese businessman decides which transaction to include in or exclude from the next Bitcoin block  
Many miners belong to pools where the individual miners choose the transactions to include in the block. The pool's role is to measure the relative hashing contribution of each pool member, and distribute block rewards to the members. The miners choose the transaction set, not the pool manager  
  
Visa censors transactions

**IF** I was developing Bitcoin today, I would not pay miners at all. Instead new coins (and fees) can be distributed to the transaction participants, as a kind of rebate. Altruistic mining is much more likely to be decentralised and honest

They retired the blockchain.info name 2 years ago. Not sure the OP is genuine, or maybe he's telling an old story  
Mostly the blockchain.com wallet is safe, because the online account only stores an encrypted copy of the phone wallet. Without the wallet password, the wallet file is inaccessible  
The wallet password is different to the online account password  
But ...  
There are occasional reports of scammers persuading people to provide their blockchain.com user/password for a "reward", and then advise the user to change the password. I have read that accessing the online account gives the scammer access to the wallet's recovery words  
Owning the recovery words allows the scammer to steal all future Bitcoin in the wallet, whenever  
I have never used the blockchain.com wallet, so I am not sure if this is a real theft vector. If so, it makes the "we only store your encrypted wallet file" security pretty useless

A transaction goes into the mempool when you submit it. It stays in the mempool until it is mined - more or less. Different nodes have different rules for expiring transactions from their own mempools  
I injected a transaction into the blockchain.info mempool. It did not get confirmed, so after 3 days I put the same transaction with a higher fee into the same mempool. It was accepted, and the previous transaction was deleted. The second transaction still did not confirm, so I made another replacement with a higher fee. This time the node rejected the new transaction because it conflicted with the second one. A few days later, the first transaction was mined, even though it was apparently not in any mempools  
As to your other question, there would be no point in rejecting transactions by Bitcoin address because a Bitcoin address is single-use. Some people are still re-using addresses, ignoring all the warnings against that practice. It would be good to see miners rejecting transactions because of address re-use, but not likely to happen

@_date: 2018-03-21 01:18:15
Not really  
A lot of the data is in valid transaction formats, not OP_RETURN arbitrary text  
For OP_RETURN ...  
Extra hashing steps could make the OP_RETURN data into a hash for the purposes of hashing the transaction, so then undesirable OP_RETURN data could later be pruned without disturbing the hash verification. Increasing the complexity of something as delicate as Bitcoin should not be done lightly. Is it worth the risk, if it might break Bitcoin? Also, this code change would only affect future transactions  
Some of the historical transactions could be removed using Satoshi Section 7 pruning, which is not yet implemented. My view of Section 7 pruning is that it will be implemented optionally, that many full nodes will choose to retain the full transaction history, so this is a half-solution, only for the OP_RETURN data  
Much of the arbitrary data is shoe-horned into ordinary transactions, by building the data into a format which validates as an output (or input) script. The outputs are not true addresses, although they're syntactically verifiable, so this means the coins are burned, can never be spent. Since there's no way to discover a private key from an address, there is also no way to determine whether an address has no private key, is unspendable  
These transaction outputs remain forever unspent, so they're not even pruned by Section 7 pruning  
Even if you can "fix" the OP_RETURN data, there's no way to determine whether a normal transaction contains arbitrary data or a real script+address in its outputs

Second question first  
Without a mining pool, you would solo mine. Solo mining does not generate 1 Bitcoin rewards. It generates 12.5 Bitcoins every block. Do you want to know how to win one block per month? Or one block in 12.5 months?  
Those are averages, not guaranteed times. If you're solo mining, you might be waiting years to win one block, even if you've bought all the miners required to find one per month. Pool mining is the only viable way to mine, to eliminate the payout variability  
Ask the pools about fees, read their Web sites. They're small enough that you won't notice  
Bitcoin creates 4380 blocks per month, each block rewards 12.5 Bitcoin  
blockchain.info has the current global hash rate per second, and there are 2.6 million seconds in a month  
One Antminer S9 hashes 14 terahashes per second  
Those are all the numbers you need to work out how many Antminers to buy to earn 1 Bitcoin per month  
Multiply by this and that, divide by the other and its brother

Then, this person invented Bitcoin to be a mechanism to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party  
Bitcoin makes some transactions possible, which were previously impossible due to the baggage of centralized payment systems - transaction censorship and transaction surveillance  
These transactions have value to the people who make them  
Every time I use Bitcoin to purchase something from a merchant who has been denied payment services by Visa and PayPal, Bitcoin has value to me and to that merchant  
This value is somewhere between $1 and $2 per Bitcoin  
Value and price are not the same

Do not believe anything you read on the Internet, or other news media. There is no investigation or research in these articles. They merely regurgitate the contents of a press release, or re-purpose articles published elsewhere  
In particular, the financial press is uncritical of any PR spin about imminent IPOs  
Bitmain is a privately held company, with no obligation to publish their financials. The profit figure in that article has no basis in fact. The revenue figure is an unsubstantiated assertion made by Jihan Wu in a recent interview. He did not claim a profit. The missing details tell the story  
Also, both figures are for 2017. The demand collapse began in February 2018  
I see more articles published while this thread is running, claiming 2018Q1 profits. I do not see anybody questioning the discrepancy between earlier PR spin articles and the recent claims. For example:

Electrum is correct  
[This]( only shows half a transaction,  
more precisely, shows one output,  
for a transaction which had one input and two outputs  
Your blocktrail URL shows the full transaction,  
3 different addresses for one input and two outputs  
You can see here, the input address has been fully spent, now has zero value:  
  
I would assume you own the output address labeled "Estimated change" 
which now contains 0.00564796  
1P1dY8Dk3JppkFR3XbJShvXzcxL7tVop4f

Merchants can accept zero-conf transactions if they believe they can afford the losses from double spends  


Risk is unpredictable  
If a merchant accepts zero-conf transactions then that merchant increases the risk of a double spend fraud targeted at himself  
A merchant may believe that having low-value transactions makes him safe from zero-conf, and the longer he operates with no double spends, the safer he feels  
By believing that double spends are rare, single-transaction events, he is ignoring the risk of a high-volume double spend attack  
By accepting zero-conf transactions, he makes himself a target of a well-planned double spend attack  


They believe zero-conf can be safe just by making pre-conf verification tighter. This belief ignores the Blockchain's role as the definitive list of valid transactions

You can do this by choosing a non-deterministic wallet  
A deterministic wallet has a seed, which is a single point of failure for theft risk, as your question asserts  
A non-deterministic wallet has a separate private key for every address  
The keys have no relationship to each other, no seed to generate every possible past and future key  
Good practice means never using the same address more than once -   
Every transaction is signed with a separate private key  
For more counter-theft security, you can store every private key separately from your wallet, and separately from all the other keys, encrypted with as many different passwords as you wish  
When you want to spend, decrypt only the key or keys necessary for each transaction, import the key into your wallet, send the transaction  
The reason "standard wallets" are deterministic wallets with seeds is that early Bitcoin users experienced a lot of Bitcoin loss through negligence - failure to backup their keys properly. Bitcoin loss through key theft was (still is) virtually non-existent  
Deterministic wallets with seeds were developed to solve the problem of loss through negligence  
Now, Bitcoin users only have to remember a small collection of words, no more fiddly backups  
If you are confident in your ability to back up your keys, and competent, then choose non-deterministic  
Be warned that a USB flash drive is not a reliable backup medium

No  
You should have your addresses in a watching-only online wallet  
and your private keys are in your cold wallet  
For example, using Electrum cold storage:  
*    construct the transaction in your watching-only wallet
*    transfer the unsigned transaction from watching to cold, by scanning the QR code of the transaction  
*    sign the transaction on cold  
*    transfer the signed transaction from cold to watching, by scanning the QR code of the transaction (in the opposite direction)  
*    broadcast the signed transaction  
  
Note: this Electrum page says to transfer the transactions using a USB flash drive  
If both devices have a camera and screen, QR scanning should work instead of USB flash drive

Yes it does  
The hash of the new block is the SHA256 hash of the block's header fields concatenated together  
The previous block's hash is one of the fields in the new block's header  
This is part of what makes the Bitcoin Blockchain immutable - safe from tampering  
It also prevents you from predictively hashing future blocks  
The other contents of the header also prevent you hashing in advance. The Merkle root hash is calculated from the ID hashes of all the transactions in a block. Unless you're planning to mine empty blocks, you can not predict which transactions are going to be in your block, therefore you can not predict the block's Merkle root hash
@_date: 2019-09-20 06:45:22


Miners are moving to BetterHash, a mining protocol which requires miners to choose the transactions in their blocks. BetterHash is necessary to improve decentralisation of Bitcoin mining. Miners will run their own nodes  


Fees will not increase because you believe they are "a requirement for ongoing security"  
Fees are given voluntarily by the transaction sender. Nobody will pay more than the minimum fee unless they desperately need a transaction to confirm when blocks are too full  


Predictions of inevitability are always wrong


Bandwidth is not a constraint for running a node, even if every block increases to 3MB. There are only 144 new blocks per day

What I mean is that I have a list of 1000 keys which I generated separately from my wallet, and then  
*    concatenated all these keys together into a file  
*    encrypted the file using GnuPG  
*    made 100,000 duplicates of the encrypted 1000-key file  
*    burned the 100,000 duplicates onto a DVD-R  
*    stored the DVD-R in a safe place  
*    burned the 100,000 duplicates onto a second DVD-R  
*    stored the second DVD-R in a second safe place  
*    made a 100% par2 recovery set for the encrypted 1000-key file  
*    made 100,000 duplicates of the par2 recovery set  
*    burned the 100,000 par2 duplicates onto a third DVD-R  
*    stored the third DVD-R with the first DVD-R  
*    burned the 100,000 par2 duplicates onto a fourth DVD-R  
*    stored the fourth DVD-R with the second DVD-R  
The GnuPG keyring is backed up in a similar manner on four different DVD-R  
and stored separately from the Bitcoin key backup DVD-R  
As said  


Every 6 months, I check each DVD to find any data corruption  
Any corrupt DVD is replaced by a new one, and  


*    multiple backups in separate locations  
*    100,000 duplicates on a single DVD  
    * this covers one common DVD failure mode, when part of the disk is unreadable, the data is often recoverable from an undamaged part  
*    par2 recovery, a mathematical data recovery technique based on Reed Solomon matrices, has 2 great features  
    * any par2 recovery block can repair any damaged block of the same size, whereever it is located in the original data file  
    * even if both the original data and par2 recovery set are partially damaged, recovery is still possible  
Some of this might be overkill but as already stated, it's cash, look after it or lose it  
The two important things are:  
*    keep unencrypted keys away from public view, or a thief can steal all your Bitcoins  
*    make sure you can recover from your backups, or you lose all your Bitcoins  
Checking your backups to make sure they still work is more important than how many backups you make or where you store them  
Start with the assumption that they will inevitably fail  
The purpose of checking them is to discover which backups have become damaged, not to ensure that they are still undamaged

A bit simpler than this  
The transaction is signed with the private key which owns one input, then the signed transaction is signed with the private key which owns the second input  


Very close  


The terminology is incorrect. There is no encryption, only cryptographic signatures. The signatures are verified using the public key, not decrypted  
Also, addresses are not public keys. An address is a hash of a hash of a public key (or it is a hash of a hash of a script, as with a SegWit output)  
Since the address (not the public key) is stored in the output, there needs to be a hashing step to prove the public key and address are matching

The Antminer S9 is not $2000  
This calculation says you're making a profit if the S9 is less than $1600, which it is  
A few weeks ago the S9 price was increased from $1500 to $2275, with a 6-week delivery delay  
Now the price is under $1500 and delivery is one week  
Bitmain must be having trouble selling them  
Is this a bargain opportunity, or a recipe for loss?  
Future profit for a new S9 depends on the Bitcoin price and the mining difficulty. Falling S9 sales mean the global hash rate is going to go down, and so mining difficulty is going to go down  
Bitcoin price? Nobody knows. It's a gamble

Not correct  


The security of Bitcoin is provided by non-mining nodes which validate every new block immediately after it is mined. The non-mining nodes work for zero financial reward  


The economic incentives are optional. Bitcoin worked superbly well for many years when Bitcoin mining was a penny-reward hobby. Litecoin and Dogecoin work as well today, offering minimal rewards to miners  
The other ingredients are not optional  
Terminology:  
A Blockchain is just an old database design known as a linked list, an unusual linked list because it is updated only by appending to the end, and immutable through the use of irreversible hashes. It is just a chain of data blocks  
Bitcoin's Blockchain is thousands of identical copies distributed across a network of nodes, to prevent it being censored by regulation or political interference - distributed, decentralised  
Is a centralised Blockchain useful? Yes, anywhere a linked list is the right database solution, a Blockchain could be useful. Is this relevant to Bitcoin? No  
Is a non-transaction Blockchain useful. Same answer. Yes, but not relevant  
Could a national Government, an International NGO bank, or a national Reserve bank create a currency with a centralised transaction blockchain. Yes, and it would still be a blockchain. But being centralised, it would serve no useful purpose  


Transparency comes from immutability. Arguably, a centralised blockchain is valuable in this context, since immutability comes from the linked hashes, does not require decentralisation  


In the case of Bitcoin, the incentive is altruism. Unpaid non-mining nodes conribute more to the decentralisation of the Blockchain than miners. The miners only contribute the work which delays the rate of block creation and makes it impossible to alter historical hashes. Distribution of the Blockchain also prevents alteration of historical hashes, because it would require a conspiracy of all the thousands of node operators. The impossibility of such a conspiracy is the main guarantee that the ledger can not be corrupted

We need the miners to create a delay between blocks  
Verification of a new block and propagation of a new block to be verified by every node is not instantaneous  
The flaw in your design is in  You're assuming that all nodes have the same set of unconfirmed transactions in their mempools. They do not. The result of your mechanism is 9000 different blocks  
The mining race creates one block, rarely two, and when there are two, there is a mechanism for resynchronising the nodes which have the orphan  
Also, your  requires clock synchronisation. The mining process creates an average 10-minute delay without having to synchronise the clocks of thousands of nodes - a timestamping server without clocks  
Clock synchronisation was one of the insurmountable stumbling blocks in earlier attempts to design decentralised systems. The brilliant elegance of Satoshi's solution is that it completely eliminates the need for accurate clocks, and establishes the sequence of events by making the Blockchain immutable, and append-only. We care about the historical order of events, not the precise time they occurred  


Node operators are motivated, but not by direct financial reward  
I would take this issue in a different direction. Remembering that in the early days, most nodes were miners (CPU hashing), and the reward was sub-pennies, why not remove the financial reward from miners?

For much of its short life Bitcoin was mined for pennies, as a hobby  
When the block reward is very small, Bitcoin miners will mine for minimal financial reward, just as they did before ASICs made greed an incentive

Genesis is not the operator of the machine, only the manufacturer. Different operators have different policies for ID requirements and limits (also different prices)  
My experiences:  
There's a store near here with 2 machines  
The white machine says "press the Buy button"  
then it scans the QR code for my Bitcoin address  
then I insert cash  
then I press "Done"  
A few minutes later the Bitcoin arrives  
No ID requirement  
$10,000 limit  
Price is a 5.5% markup over the quoted rate at a well-known Bitcoin exchange  
The orange machine says "Enter your mobile number"  
I enter mobile number  
SMS arrives, 4-digit code, I enter the 4-digit code into the machine  
Everything else, the same as the white machine

Yes, if every node has the same copy of the Blockchain  
No, because there is potentially more than one Blockchain, with variations in the most recent blocks due to two miners occasionally winning the same race simultaneously (orphan branches)  
This is the reason people are advised to wait for 6 confirmations. It is almost impossible for an orphan to become more than 6 blocks deep before its node resynchronises to the majority chain  
A 51% attack may increase the incidence of orphan branches

The value of your coins is on the Blockchain, as the amount field in a transaction output  
Your ability to spend your coins depends on your ownership of your private keys  
Electrum servers are not accessed for the purpose of using one or more private keys to sign a new transaction. Transaction signing can be done off-line  
Electrum servers are the most convenient way for Electrum users to access the transactions containing the coins you want to spend  
Example:  
Go to   
Enter 1NkKLMgbSjXrT7oHagnGmYFhXAWXjJsKCj into the address box and click Load  
Enter some addresses and amounts in the Outputs tab  
Click Submit, and now you have an unsigned transaction

If everybody did this, all the time,  
and nobody ever publicly revealed any of their addresses,  
and nobody ever revealed the addresses of the people they transact with,  
then the entire Bitcoin ledger would be totally private  
Every address would appear in the Blockchain only once as a transaction output,  
and only once more as an input when it is spent  


Your worked example has no change addresses  
Keeping your example simple, but including some realistic dollar amounts for clarity  
You have one address which has received only one transaction for $1000  
You have to pay $600 to your landlord  
This transaction has one input, worth $1000  
It has 2 outputs: $600 to your landlord, $400 back to you  
The $400 should not be sent to your $1000 address, because that would be address re-use  
Instead it goes to a fresh new address  
The original address was worth $1000 and is now worth zero, and if you follow the "no re-use" rule you will never use it again  
Now your landlord can see you had $1000, you gave him $600, and $400 went to another address  
He would guess that is your change address, but he doesn't know for certain  
It could just as easily be the address you used to pay your babysitter  
If you want to outwit the landlord guessing your change address, you can split the $1000 into 5 x $200, all paid to yourself, then send him 3 of those $200s. He only knows you own the 3 x $200s you gave him, and has no clue who owned the $1000 they were split from, or who owns the other 2 x $200s. Make the 5 amounts non-equal to make this more credible, and spend $601 so he can see that your change address is receiving $1  
Backtrack a bit ...  
Important:  
*    every input is fully spent to zero in every transaction  
*    nearly every transaction will have at least 2 outputs, because of change  
*    if a transaction has 2 outputs - the payee's address and the payer's change address - the Blockchain does not tell you which address is which
*    if you pay from yourself to yourself, there is no way to tell this transaction is any different from a transaction paying one or more other people

Not enough  
All those transactions are in blocks  
Every block has a hash  
The block's hash changes when you alter a transaction  
Every block contains the hash of the previous block  
The block's hash changes when you alter its previous block hash  
You can not alter a block hash without repeating the mining race which created the block's hash originally - this applies to every block from the oldest one you altered to the most recent  
51% of the hashing power is not enough to do this. You would need the sum of all the hashing power used to hash all the historical blocks  
A 51% attack could allow you to create new orphan blocks, sometimes. That is, when a 49% miner wins the hashing race, your 51% has a good chance of creating a winning block simultaneously, so there are two winning blocks being propagated around the node network  
Whenever orphan blocks appear on some nodes, those nodes recognise that their chain has deviated from the majority chain, and they discard their orphan branches and resynchronise  
A 51% attack could create a situation where it becomes impossible for any node to know which chain to resynchronise to, if there are too many variations of orphan branches propagated around the node network

* Governments no longer control the supply of money, preventing them from managing the economy

* Banks and money transmitters currently charge exorbitant fees to move money from country to country. Bitcoin undermines this business

Fees peaked in January 2018, at around $25  
Until a couple of hours ago, any transaction would confirm with a 1Sat/byte fee, about $0.02, SegWit or not. Node minimum relay rules prevent lower fees  
The mempool of unconfirmed transactions surged a couple of hours ago, so the low fee days are now a fleeting memory  
Worth noting that Litecoin recently reduced their minimum relay fee by 90%. You can get a Litecoin transaction confirmed with a fee of 1 Litoshi/byte, about $.0006

No  
With a 10-minute interval and 1MB block size Bitcoin scales to full blocks at 3 transactions / second  
With the various proposed improvements to make transactions smaller and implement sidechains, it scales to more than 3 transactions / second, but not much more  
The simplest scaling solution is to make a clone  
New blockchain, new network, same parameters, same software  
This instantly doubles capacity  
And later, when both chains have reached capacity (full blocks), clone it again

False  
There are nearly zero economies of scale in Bitcoin mining. The cost almost linearly correlates to hash rate. Any operation which is big enough to require paid administrative staff quickly becomes uneconomic  


This is false too, since Bitcoin contains an automatic difficulty adjustment. When profitability falls, miners leave, the difficulty is adjusted down, profits are available for the remaining miners, always marginal, always constrained by power costs and by the current Bitcoin fiat exchange rate  
No implosion in that scenario

The premise of your question is flawed  
So-called "altcoins" are also increasing in "value"  
The simplest answer to the "value" question is that the USD exchange rate has no correlation with the utility value of Bitcoin as money for buying things  
The USD exchange rate for Bitcoin is primarily driven by a ["greater fool"]( bubble  
More interesting ...  
Why does Bitcoin continue to be popular when the fee situation is causing confirmation delays which strangle its utility?  
and the answer is ...  
It is less and less popular, relative to Litecoin (for example), precisely because of this problem  
On the other hand, where there are real-life use cases for buying things, the majority of merchants are accepting Bitcoin only, not a choice of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and so on  
The current fee congestion problem is fairly new, and will begin to drive merchants to Litecoin soon  
What happens next?  
The altcoins which are cloned from Bitcoin all have the same transaction fee weakness  
One by one, as they become more popular, they'll all suffer identical full-block and escalating fee problems  
Satoshi Junior will look up from his cryptography textbook,  evaluate this tragic history of his father's legacy,  
and build a new altcoin - with zero fees and zero mining rewards

The default minimum network fee is 1 Satoshi per byte  
If you're using Electrum, choose "Edit fees manually", move the slider all the way back to 1 Sat/byte, and send  
An ordinary transaction with one input and two outputs will be about 230 bytes, and a 230-Satoshi fee is about 1.6 cents  
  
This shows the number of unconfirmed transactions is currently less than 1000. Most blocks can fit more than 2000 transactions

First, a clarification  
A wallet is not a single private key  
Bitcoin does not work that way  
Every transaction requires one or more new private keys  
Your wallet is the collection of all the private keys you have ever used to receive Bitcoin  
The whole purpose of deterministic wallets requires you to keep all the keys together in the same wallet forever  
Then you never have to worry about losing your money because you forgot to backup your wallet  
Lose your wallet, type in your seed phrase, and there's your wallet again  


Not sure this matters. I had the impression they're all using the same technique  
My objection to deterministic wallets is that the entire key set is potentially exposed to theft if a thief discovers the seed phrase  
A patient thief does not have to steal the funds from the wallet immediately, because the seed phrase gives him access to all future keys as well as prior keys - wait until there is one or more keys with substantial value before stealing  
So ...  
You want to look after your keys yourself  
You are confident you know how to backup your keys  
Use a non-deterministic wallet  
Bitcoin Core has an option to disable the deterministic algorithm,  
see the documentation of that wallet  
Electrum has an option to use a separate wallet file - not the default deterministic one  
Electrum has another option to import keys into a wallet file  
This is my preference:  
* use Electrum  
* ignore the default deterministic wallet completely  
* make your own keys - a private key is nothing more than a string of 256 random bits  
* import the keys into an alternative Electrum wallet file  
* tell Electrum to only use your non-deterministic wallet  
* make multiple (encrypted) backups on DVD-RW of all your private keys  
* store the backups in separate places  
* make fresh backups whenever you add more keys to your wallet  
There are plenty of tools for dumping (exporting all the private keys from) any wallet,  
deterministic or not  
It's easy to do, but discouraged - for above reason  
You choose:  
Deterministic is more secure because backups are trivial, just write down those 12 seed words somewhere  
Non-deterministic is more secure because you can control your keys and their backups however you like, the keys are not all mathematically linked back to a single seed  
Choose deterministic, and guard your seed phrase securely  
Choose non-deterministic, and keep a robust backup strategy  
Or choose a combination:  
deterministic for day-to-day small-value transactions  
non-deterministic with a carefully designed backup process for high-value keys

The Bitmain price for their most popular device (Antminer S9) is slightly lower than it was in November/December. There was a temporary 50% price increase ($2275) after the November pre-orders were delivered in January 2018  
Bitmain have abandoned that 50% price increase and are now quoting next-week delivery. This indicates that demand has collapsed. This is a bargain buying opportunity

If you store them securely and someone breaks the secure storage,  
or you memorise them so well that you recite them after falling asleep at a party  
then then entire key set is exposed to theft,  
including all future keys  
With a set of non-deterministic keys,  
you have the option to separate the keys to reduce the theft risk  
Split the $5000 across 10 keys,  
store the keys in 10 different places,  
the theft risk is reduced to the value associated with each key  
The downside is that you have to be sure you never lose the keys,  
the lower theft risk is offset by a higher risk of loss through forgetting or misplacing

So read it, it's only a few hundred lines  
All it does is format private keys into base58check (and various other formats, more and less useful)  
and ECDSA encrypt private keys to public keys  
You can verify that the public keys it makes are the same as any wallet makes  
You can read the code and see that it uses the same OpenSSL function for ECDSA as most wallets, and as Core used to use before they found a faster method  
It does not make transactions

"No controls" is not strictly true, more and more exchanges are being forced by law to apply KYC and AML rules to more and more customers  
The main flaw in the article is that it fails to discuss the mechanism by which international AML controls and cooperation operate  
As this mechanism has developed over the past 3 decades,  there was an initial rush to compliance  
with a significant list of exceptions ...  
The banking privacy principles of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, various small Caribbean and Pacific nations looking for revenue as tax havens  
One by one, these exceptions have fallen to brutal "diplomatic" pressure, primarily from the USA  
Vanuatu for example, was forced into international AML cooperation, simply by organising for all major commercial banks to refuse to trade with Vanuatu banks unless Vanuatu complied  
Does Bitcoin offer an opportunity to escape this type of international "diplomatic" blackmail?  
Not if banks embrace Bitcoin and integrate it into the world financial system  
To the extent that Bitcoin remains a person-to-person currency it is potentially free from regulation, whatever laws are passed to try and control it

Do not confuse a deterministic seed with a private key  
And a pass phrase is something different again

A pass phrase is for decrypting a wallet file, which you encrypted to protect it from theft  
A deterministic seed is for re-creating a lost deterministic wallet from scratch  
Every private key has a corresponding public key  
Every transaction in the blockchain has the public keys of all the transaction inputs and all the transaction outputs  
Public keys are often referred to as addresses  
A wallet has dozens, or hundreds or thousands of addresses (public keys), usually one for each private key  
A public key is created by:  
* putting a private key into an encryption algorithm,  
* passing it through 2 hashing algorithms,  
* making it pretty by applying Base58Check encoding

Yes, there is no method to verify that the Raspbian root partition has not been maliciously modified in between loading it onto the SD and booting the Pi Zero  
The extra packages can be checked against their official hashes or signed keys, but the main risk is malware added to Raspbian during the period it is mounted  
I had a half-baked idea to copy the extra packages via QR, but the maximum capacity of the largest QR is 23,648 bits  
Possible, but a lot of work to split a package into hundreds of QR-sized pieces, automatically flash all the QR images onto the screen (one or two per second), capture them with the Pi camera in video mode, then reconstruct the package  
Incomplete ...  
    # split file to be transferred into QR sized pieces
    split -b 2800 -d -a 3 qrencode_3.4.4.orig.tar.bz2 qrencode_
    # convert pieces to QR png images
    for piece in qrencode_???;do qrencode -8v40 -s4 -o$piece.qr.png $piece;done
    # make a movie (lossless)
    ffmpeg -framerate 2 -i qrencode_%03d.qr.png -vcodec zlib qrencode.qr.mkv
    # play the movie
    mplayer -fs qrencode.qr.mkv
Unfortunately, this technique suffers the same bootstrap problem it is trying to solve - the Pi Zero needs picamera to record the movie, ffmpeg (or similar) to split the movie into single frames, zbar-tools to decode the QR images  
I'll leave this here as a possible technique for air gap data transfer, where the quantity of data is too much for a single QR

Blockchain, not network  
The blockchain stores transactions  
A transaction has inputs and outputs  
Transaction outputs are addresses  
An address corresponds to the public half of a key-pair in some wallet  
Addresses do not exist in the blockchain,  
except in the context of transactions,  
where they exist as transaction outputs  
A transaction input is a link to one of the outputs in an earlier transaction  


Someone wants to send you coins  
You tell them the next available address in your wallet  
Their transaction appears on the blockchain  
Your address exists, as a consequence of being a transaction output  
The address did not exist until the transaction entered the blockchain,  
even though it existed in your wallet

One of the cryptography pieces of Bitcoin  
In public-key cryptography, you make a signature using a private key,  
and then the signature can be verified (by someone else) to belong to the public key  
You sign a transaction using the private key and a crypto cipher  
You can do this offline  
The same crypto cipher is used by a Bitcoin node to verify that signature, and that proves you own the coin you're spending

Bitcoin mining is an algorithm for solving (an otherwise pointless) a problem which is designed to take an average of 10 minutes  
You'll need to research elsewhere if you want to understand exactly what SHA256 is  
The algorithm: assemble all the significant data belonging to the next block of transactions, append a counter, apply SHA256, test value of SHA256 result against target value, if higher than target value, increment the counter, and repeat SHA256  
First person to find a SHA256 result lower than the target value wins a prize, and their version of the next block is added to the blockchain  
All the nodes in the Bitcoin network check that the SHA256 result is correct, and they accept that block of transactions as the newest block to add to their copies of the Blockchain  


Bitcoin is a currency for buying and selling goods and services, like cash, and unlike cash does not require buyer and seller to be in the same physical location  


Nobody. It runs by itself, through the trust of all the users who agree on the rules and processes  


All Bitcoin users benefit  
Mining is only one component of the Bitcoin system. More important are the Blockchain, which is a permanent immutable  ledger of all transactions; and the cryptographic transaction signing process, which prevents other people stealing your coins  
Mining is primarily a mechanism for governing the rate at which new blocks are added to the Blockchain - only allowing a new block to be added when there is proof that the work done by miners (in aggregate) - running SHA256 repeatedly, consuming electricity - is sufficient work that one miner finally discovers a SHA256 result which is lower than the required target

What advantage is a Bitcoin ATM compared to selling Bitcoin over the counter?  
You can scan a QR code with a webcam or a tablet  
An ATM would give you lower wages, automatic currency reader/counter, locked cash box  
But is the trade going to be high enough to justify the outlay - high enough that you're too busy selling Bitcoin to serve your other customers  
Unless there's a labour saving (the ATM avoids hiring extra staff), the ATM can never pay for itself, because you can sell Bitcoin over the counter for the same exchange rates and fees

There is not a "private key to sign transactions"  
Bitcoin works by creating new key-pairs for every transaction  
A wallet typically contains hundreds of keys, most of them with zero value  
Each private key will normally be used to sign only one transaction

Some suggestions:  
1. The possibility that a blockchain currency could fail through network congestion - where the time required to verify each new block, and propagate a new block to all nodes exceeds the block interval for so long that the blockchain can no longer be updated in time. What conditions could cause such a catastrophe? Are there methods for measuring network performance, and monitoring conditions which could provide advance warning? If network congestion is non-linear, is it even possible to be warned in time to alleviate the problem?  
1. Is there a better way to build an immutable ledger than piling transactions into blocks, and chaining the blocks by linking their hashes? Is it possible to have a distributed, decentralised currency with verification at transaction level, and no blocks?  
1. Microtransactions as the basis for a completely new Internet business model. Instead of using periodic subscriptions and advertising to fund Web businesses, use a pay-per-view model. No membership requirements, just a simple "click to pay 4 Satoshis" to read a news story or view a video. Users can configure their browsers and their devices to automatically pay fees below a certain amount, with daily or monthly limits. Publishers can implement algorithms to set prices according to demand, minute by minute. This is a "no middleman" system. Your money isn't going to a giant media corporation. The reader pays the writer. The viewer pays the film maker. Payments are like tiny cash coins, using a blockchain currency, either paid automatically or paid with a single click, depending on how much the user wants to control their tiny payments - more automatic for convenience, less automatic for more control  
1. A variation on the microtransaction theme, where the so-called Internet of Things is a network of automated devices and on-line services paying each other (with no human intervention) for access to the resources necessary to perform their functions  
1. Last, a very simple, but very contentious economic conundrum: why are Bitcoin nodes operated for altruistic motives, but miners receive financial incentives? Could there be a blockchain currency with zero-reward mining?

Howard Marks is just repeating something he read somewhere else  
This claim has been repeated by ignorant fools like him for years  
On the other hand, the context of his comments is that he is advising people not to invest in Bitcoin  
Even though it is not a pyramid, it's easy to make a strong argument against buying Bitcoin expecting its value to increase  


Bitcoin is a form of money  
Money is an abstract means of assigning comparative value to non-comparable goods and services  
Money has no tangible value  
Bitcoin's value is the value implicit in the most recent transaction used to buy or sell goods or services with Bitcoin, the price agreed by the seller and buyer in the transaction  


Bitcoin's current USD exchange rate is a "greater fool" bubble  
Bitcoin has no tangible value  
There is no scarcity  
When the bubble bursts, it will probably fall back to $2 or less, and then become more useful for day-to-day spending

No, the bandwidth is mainly a function of the combined latency of individual nodes propagating blocks  
Any change to the work done by a node to propagate a block has the potential to increase the time it takes  
The cumulative effect of increasing the latency of every node is **non-linear** and unpredictable  
A very small change can easily cause the current network status - comfortably uncongested - to escalate to gridlock,

Several possible responses, the main one is "who cares?"  
KYC/AML laws are not considered to be oppression of basic liberties, but are accepted as "protecting the safety of the people"  
This is what people vote for in democracies, representatives who make laws to "protect the people" at the expense of basic liberties like privacy  
No matter how much Americans and citizens of other so-called liberal democracies claim that their liberties are basic rights and protected by a Constitution, they keep voting overwhelmingly for lawmakers who make more and more laws to restrict basic rights  
Most people don't care  
They want to be protected from the current bogeyman of the day  
If a large number of Bitcoin users care about this issue, they should all boycott any exchange which bends over to KYC/AML  
This opens a business opportunity for rebel exchanges, provided they can avoid being shut down and prosecuted by the American authorities  
IMO, the best option is to stop using "exchanges" and make all transfers person-to-person, and I do not mean LocalBitcoins.

No, the goal of Bitcoin is to fill a gap which is not provided by chartered banks or other payment processors

using Bitcoin on the network is equivalent to using cash in the real world  
The other things, the political goals, anarchist and libertarian wet dreams, are all possible side-effects of a currency with no central control, especially in a world where financial management and regulation is so corrupt that the entire world economy is on the verge of fraud-induced collapse

So do non-HD wallets  


Privacy is not the purpose of a HD wallet  
All wallets create new addresses for every incoming  
The purpose of a HD wallet is that it provides an easy way to avoid losing your keys, because all your keys are mathematically connected to the seed  
Saving your keys for non-HD wallet requires making a backup of all your keys  
Saving your keys for a HD wallet only requires you to remember your seed, or remember where you wrote it down  


Ask your new wallet to display multiple receiving addresses  
Electrum lets you provide a list of output addresses for any transaction  
Send many to many

Electrum does, although I think you have to do it indirectly, by freezing all the addresses you do not want to use

Isn't it great  


Bitcoin doesn't. An asymmetric cryptography cipher makes it impossible to reverse-calculate a private key from a public key, not completely impossible - infinitesimally possible, immensely unlikely  
You're looking at this upside-down  
Imagine you're a brilliant child mathematics prodigy 60 years ago, and you notice that long multiplication is much faster than long division  
Twenty years later, you're a really clever mathematician with a PhD working at a University, and you think it would be cool to discover a mathematical process which is fast to calculate in one direction, but impossibly slow - billions of years - to calculate in reverse  
Thus was discovered one (and many more) asymmetric cryptography ciphers  
To trivialise an example, go back to our mathematician's school days  
Long multiplication is much faster than long division  
Today you can go to bigprimes.net and pick a couple of 11-digit prime numbers, then multiply them together on paper - maybe you'll have the result in 30 minutes  
Transcribe the result to a blank piece of paper, burn the first piece of paper and forget the prime numbers you started with  
Now you know you have a large composite number which has 2 11-digit prime numbers as its only factors  
Find those factors - the 2 prime numbers you started with - by long division  
Not enough time in the remaining life of the universe  
You could guess the 2 numbers, if you're really, really lucky,  
not "I can win the lottery" lucky,  
but "there's a small chance I could win every lottery on every planet in the universe until the end of time" lucky  
For reasons best understood by mathematicians, prime number asymmetric ciphers are nearly obsolete, and have been replaced by elliptic curves  
The details are not important. All we need to care about is that asymmetric ciphers are immensely asymmetric

They could be trading their customers' Bitcoin on gdax or other trading exchanges, keeping the profits, and then giving back the Bitcoins as required  
This would be unethical, not necessarily illegal  
Would be risky, if the trading caused losses instead of profits they're losing customers' coins, not their own (as happened at MtGox)  
Does their contract state that they will always keep all customers' coins available for instant withdrawal, and will never trade or loan customers' coins?

Correct me if I'm confused  
I think you're saying it's easier to memorise your own algorithm than to memorise a passphrase, and is therefore a better option  
I'd be concerned about whether the method is less secure,  
for the same reason as it's easier to remember,  
especially since you've published it on Reddit  
OK, you have passwords as well as your algorithm  
It still seems a bit convoluted/backwards  
I was thinking of a totally different approach for non-deterministic key set  
To create 1000 keys, extract 32000 bytes from a random source, like /dev/urandom on Linux, or whatever on other O/S  
Then make the 1000 keys (32 bytes at a time), convert to base58check, import into Electrum non-deterministic wallet  
Then use GnuPG or OpenSSL or your preferred encryption app to encrypt the original 32000 random bytes as a single file, and store the encrypted version wherever, burn them to a DVD-RW, in a cloud, etc  
You have to look after the encrypted file, to save your coins from loss by neglect  
and you have to look after your encryption keys, to protect your coins from theft  
Given those things are taken care of ...  
Rebuilding the non-deterministic wallet with the same 1000 keys only requires decrypting the stored randoms, and re-importing into a fresh Electrum wallet

That is correct  
A sweep is a transaction on the Blockchain,  
a transaction which sends Bitcoins from yourself to yourself

Excuse me rambling a bit ...  
You can find advice which says sweeping a paper wallet is safer  
This is true in the case where some stranger in a cafe gave you a paper wallet in exchange for cash - the stranger may still have another copy of the keys, and might rush home and sweep them to himself  
If you made the paper wallet yourself, and nobody else has ever seen the private keys, then you control the keys, and it is safe to import the keys into a no-seed Electrum wallet

I don't care what happens on the BCash network, since they have deluded themselves that they can control pre-confirmation mempool activity to make zero-conf safe  


Definitely not super easy. You've probably never tried it. I attempted non-RBF replacements at least 10 times during the block congestion period in January 2018. They were all rejected  
Then (and still today) most nodes rejected non-RBF replacement transactions with an "already in mempool" error message  
Even if one node accepts a non-RBF replacement transaction - XT nodes, as you say - the transaction will be rejected when the XT node tries to relay it to other nodes. The chance of the replacement transaction getting to a miner is almost zero  
Apart from that, you're right. Mempool activity is non-consensus. Nodes are free to handle replacement transactions any way they want. Consensus rules only apply after confirmation - no new block can contain a double-spend transaction. This doesn't prevent multiple transactions in the mempool attempting to spend the same inputs. If there are multiples, a miner will pick one only, arbitrarily  
Satoshi's double-spend solution was purposely simple. Previous digital currencies had complicated logic to choose one transaction as true, and the others as fraudulent double-spends. Bitcoin allows one only, makes no attempt to determine which is first or second in the mempools, makes no attempt to determine one as honest and the other as fraud  
Arguably, RBF and "already in mempool" rejection should both be removed from Bitcoin, because they encourage a false belief that zero-conf is safe  
To emphasise this point ...  
In January 2018, I had a transaction which was not urgent, so I set the fee to 10 Sat/byte. Everybody else was paying $6-$15 fees per transaction. I deliberately chose not to set RBF. The transaction did not confirm. I tried sending replacements. They were rejected "already in mempool". I tried injecting my replacements into different nodes. This worked a few times, but those nodes couldn't relay the replacement to other nodes, so they deleted the transaction after a few hours. After about 3 days (not 2 weeks, for reasons I won't discuss here) the transaction disappeared from the mempools. I resubmitted, still with a low fee, still no confirmation. I attempted replacements again, with the same results  
After 25 days, the mempools cleared. What happened next is very important. A miner made a block using transactions 3-6 weeks old, all transactions which had expired from mempools. This block was mined. My **original transaction** was in this block

Make a new transaction which contains at least one of the same inputs as the unconfirmed transaction and send to an address owned by you. This makes the unconfirmed transaction impossible to confirm, and keeps the coins in your own wallet  


No  
Understand the inputs of your transaction  
Each input is spending an output from an older transaction  
This output is a "coin"  
A coin can only be spent once  
Your replacement transaction has to spend exactly the same coin as your original transaction. If the original transaction has more than one input, the replacement needs to spend at least one of the same coins as the original

The assumptions underlying this question are  
*    that miners operate in unison, vs non-mining nodes  
*    that the true chain is the chain followed by the miners  
The first assumption is wrong. The second assumption only works if the first is true  
Here's a better way of understanding the issue, a thought experiment ...  
Make a software change which modifies consensus rules. Some nodes accept the new rules, and some nodes reject the new rules. There will be a chain fork. One chain will have blocks which are rejected for the other chain  
The forks do not diverge by miners vs non-miners. They diverge by which nodes accept or reject the consensus change. There will be mining nodes and non-mining nodes on both sides of the fork  
Your "majority doesn't count" claim ...  


Everybody knows the answer to this. Consensus is not a majority vote. That's the point you're attempting to make. The fallacy in your argument is still the same - you assume that all miners act in unison  
Where is the power then?  
You're explicitly claiming "only miners and economic nodes". This is a disproved and now dead argument. The only people who persist in this belief are the remnants of the New York Agreement group who can not admit that their money does not grant power over a community-driven project. The big block debate led to the NYA, driven by a belief that Bitcoin as a business - exchanges and mining manufacturers - was too important to be run as a non-profit project staffed by part-time volunteers. The NYA group lost the argument 2 years ago. It is dead  
Other issues ...  
Concentration  
Bitcoin's principle design purpose is resistance to transaction censorship. The decentralised node network presents a widely dispersed attack surface, which is inaccessible to regulators and corrupt corporations who desire control over which transactions are allowed  
On the other hand, mining is pooled, and a small number of pools oversee all mining. Miners themselves are widely distributed, and not actually controlled by their pool managers. This fact is poorly understood in discussions about concentration. It is also only partly true. Unfortunately, pools tell miners which transactions to include in each block, except that at least one pool allows miners to select some of the transactions in the block being mined  
This means that miners do not need to run nodes. Only the pool managers need to run nodes, and there are only a small number of pools. This is a problem. It has an obvious solution - more on this later  
Returning to your argument that only mining nodes matter, you're saying that fewer than 20 nodes - the nodes operated by pool managers - control the Bitcoin network. If true, this means that transaction censorship is possible, that regulators only need to identify and threaten a handful of node operators and they can decide which transactions are allowed or banned  
Your purpose for posting this opinion could be exactly this. You are paid by a regulator to find a way to attack Bitcoin's decentralised censorship resistance. Or maybe you are the BCash advocate using the "mining nodes matter" argument to justify the fact that BCash has less than 20 independent node operators controlling several hundred sybil nodes on the AWS network  
Is mining concentration a problem? We don't really know, because, to date, no regulator has attempted to attack Bitcoin by forcing pool managers to implement transaction censorship. I suggest it would only require 2 pools to refuse censorship for such an attack to fail. The community could then discuss and implement a solution to the censorship of the other pools  
A solution ...  
Miners should run their own nodes. Miners should select the transactions for the blocks they mine. There is a mining protocol available for this. It should be implemented by all pools. The pool should do nothing more than coordinate the distribution of the block rewards to the pool members  
Back to this one ...  


Non-mining nodes are important in the reverse situation. If some miners attempt to modify consensus rules, and most non-mining nodes reject those blocks, then those miners are wasting their hash power. Their fork chain will mine a low-value coin, and their rewards will be too low to cover their costs. **The miners have no power to decide whether their 12.5 Bitcoin reward is worth USD80 or USD80000**  
In the 4th quarter of 2017, BCash advocates attempted to force the fiat exchange prices of Bitcoin and BCash to flip. Three attempts failed  


What you're actually claiming here is that so-called "economic interests" - exchanges and mining manufacturers - are more important than Bitcoin's decentralisation. You're claiming that the profits of Coinbase, Gemini and Bitmain are more important than the censorship resistance of Bitcoin

The technique described below is for a set of non-deterministic keys  
I do not use deterministic wallets, because the seed is a single point of failure for theft or loss by misfortune  
I prefer my keys to have no mathematical relationship to each other  
* Generated 100,000 private keys offline, encrypted them, saved them on a DVD-R  
* Made a second, identical DVD-R, stored it somewhere else  
* Made a 100% par2 recovery set of the 100,000 private keys, encrypted the par2 recovery blocks, saved them on a DVD-R  
* Made a second, identical DVD-R of the par2 files, stored it somewhere else  
I have enough keys for several lifetimes. My wallets only have a few keys in them, enough to support day-to-day use  
When I need more keys (or if I need to re-import old keys for spending or watching), I load the DVD-R, decrypt, import the keys I need  
If I have any high-value keys, they are generated separately, encrypted and saved on separate DVDs  
The par2 repair files protect against bitrot, data corruption which occasionally makes DVD-R disks partially unreadable  
par2 is an error correction technique which enables corrupt data to be repaired,  
even if there is corruption in both the original data, and the par2 blocks,  
provided that the amount of uncorrupted par2 blocks is greater than the amount of corrupted original data

Not correct  
An invalid chain tip occurs when 2 miners mine different blocks at the same time, then some nodes get one block, and other nodes get the other one. This is resolved one or two blocks later, when some nodes discover that the next block has a prev_block_hash not matching. The node software calculates which chain is "longest" and each node chooses whether to discard 2 or 3 blocks from its tip and replace them  
The devs complaining about your snapshots are assuming you want to publish current-block snapshots. Their argument vanishes when you decide to publish only old-enough snapshots. They know this, therefore their objections are a straw man  
Unless ...

You want to have your cake and eat it too  
Offline signing is complicated because you have to construct a transaction online then copy it to offline to sign it, or copy your unspent coins from online to offline, then construct the transaction offline and sign it offline  
Then you have to copy the signed transaction to online so that you can broadcast it  
Plugging a Trezor into USB hides the details of this, making it appear simple  
Not familiar with coldcardwallet, but for offline signing, I use the process described here:  
  
except that I see a usb stick as a potential malware vector, so I transfer transactions between online and offline and back again using QR codes on screen, and cameras  
The offline Electrum is installed on a Raspberry Pi Zero, a small, cheap Linux PC with no network  
It's not really complicated. The second one will be much easier. Don't be in a hurry  
If you want to avoid the learning curve, or you are impatient, choose the easy option, and accept the risk of plugging the hard wallet into the PC. The risk is insignificant

You don't have a choice. If you mine as an independent, you might mine a single block in 20 years. Your miner will not last more than 2 years  
A pool does not control its miners. You run your miner, send your shares to the pool manager, receive your payment a few days later

It is foolish to use the word "obviously" for things which are not obvious  
Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty, in either direction  
When some miners retire, the global hash rate goes down, the block interval increases, then the mining difficulty is automatically adjusted down (this happens every 2016 blocks)  
This has already happened. The global hash rate has gone down from 61 million terahashes / second to 37 million terahashes per second  
Bitcoin still produces 1 block every 10 minutes on average, occasionally slightly more than 10 minutes in between adjustments  


This question is asked here several times every week, always with the same false all-or-nothing assumption. The Bitcoin price falls, and some miners retire. The automatic Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment mechanism provides profitability for those who remain in the network

Only for receiving money. This QR code is a Bitcoin address. It is the exchange's address, liked to your exchange account. Your exchange account is not a wallet, because those receiving addresses and all your Bitcoin coins belong to the exchange's wallet

If all miners (not just mining pools) are running nodes, then all nodes are equally important to the network because there is no way for a node to know which of its neighbour nodes are miners. Each new block propagates from the winning miner's node to the nodes the miner is connected to, and from there to every node in the network. Every mining node needs to have the correct, longest chain in order to mine a new block. A miner's node can not choose to connect only to other miners. My non-mining node needs to have the correct, longest chain in order to support the security of my own Bitcoin transactions

The sender chooses the fee. Once he has sent the transaction, it is too late to tell him "No Bitcoin, please pay cash" because his fee was too low  
If the Bitcoin network is congested: blocks are full, confirmations are slow, fees are high, it is safer to ban Bitcoin until the congestion clears. Sorry, Bitcoin is off the menu tonight, we are accepting Litecoin instead

Bitcoin's benefits are obvious, to those who put the time into understanding what it is. Everybody else is making a choice to ignore it. Their counter-arguments are shallow because they have chosen not to put the time into understanding it. It's not our job to persuade. Progress is slow, for this social reason

Miners and almost all non-mining nodes will reject the replacement unless the original was RBF, or their mempool somehow failed to receive the original, or the original has expired from the mempool  
Normal mempool expiry time is 14 days, but when the mempool is full (mempool space varies from node to node), lowest fee transactions can be expired after 1-3 days  
Even then, if you inject the replacement into a node which missed or expired the original, that node will be unable to relay the replacement if most other nodes still have the original

Vague words. Try a precise definition  
A genuine definition of "intelligence" might define it as something machines can never have  
"Self learning" is only a tiny part of intelligence. You're missing sentience, motivation, morality  


It's not an engineering question  
AI is a complex collection of unresolved philosophical issues  
For example, human intelligence relies on a high degree of fallibility, imperfection. Yet, human society does not tolerate errors. We make our own paradox  
For a machine to emulate human intelligence it must be designed to be fallible. All the information machines we use today are deterministic. All their mistakes are caused by their human programmers. There is a huge army of people dedicated to hunting down and repairing these coding mistakes  
We can not tolerate fallibility in humans, even though fallibility is an essential component of human intelligence. Would we ever have the courage to design fallibility, non-deterministic behaviour in our machines? If we do, how to we teach the machine to recognise an error? How do we pre-install moral choices, the ability to distinguish right from wrong? How could we possibly do these things when all our own morality and ethics are so ambiguous?

The Bitcoin network does not delete unconfirmed transactions. Individual Bitcoin nodes do. Every node has a slightly different pool of unconfirmed transactions. Every node has a different policy for when to delete an unconfirmed transaction. The default is 14 days. Any node operator can change this. Also, if a node's mempool becomes full, it may delete the oldest unconfirmed transaction, regardless of age

Tell me the part which says Bitcoin is for moving millions or billions  
Bitcoin is a temporary token to buy and spend, receive and sell, a convenient method of online payment. That is, the customer buys enough Bitcoin to purchase something online, spends the Bitcoin, then the merchant sells the Bitcoin  
There needs to be enough Bitcoin to cover the period between the customer buying Bitcoin and the merchant selling the same Bitcoin, multiplied by all the transactions for this period. Then the value of Bitcoin is a function of the average duration of the buy/spend/sell cycle, the number of transactions in this period, and the average transaction value  
At 350,000 transactions per day, average transaction value $80, average buy/spend/sell cycle time 24 hours, Bitcoin's circulating supply need to be worth about $28 million

What if you and I can run a couple of Satoshi-pruned nodes, 30 minutes to initialise the Blockchain  
and the "safety" node operators can run a full archival node, not pruned  
Both Blockchains can co-exist in the same network  
I mean, the "fake pruned" nodes currently operate on the same network, and the Core software is coded so that they participate in consensus. The main restriction is that they are unable to serve historical blocks to initialise a new node  
Logically, a Satoshi-pruned node would be able to participate in consensus as much as an archival node, because it has all the same UTXO set, and unpruned transactions for every UTXO. It also has every block, all the way back to genesis, so it can serve blocks to initialise new Satoshi-pruned nodes  
If Bitcoin wants more nodes, the problem you described in your post is a deterrent to initialising a node, and a deterrent to operating a node for your own wallet. The rescanning, index building, UTXO DB building are just too slow  


"They" can be anybody with the time, motivation and coding skills to implement the pruning method described in the White Paper. I've detected no interest from the current contributors, but also very few objections. The only coherent objection so far has been a claim that pruning transactions is risky because of the occasional need to re-org after an orphan block. Satoshi's own words deal with that issue: "Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks". The proposal is not to delete new, fully-spent transactions from their blocks. They have to be old enough (buried deep enough) to be beyond any possibility of re-org

Read this:   
The lesson is that no backup has any value unless you can restore from it  
There's no perfect answer, but my current preference is burning to DVD, multiple DVDs stored in separate locations, and create 100% par2 recovery blocks, again burned to multiple DVDs and stored in separate locations  
par2 is an error correction mechanism, which can rescue partially corrupt data, even when both the original DVD and the par2 DVD are partially corrupt  
More importantly, I routinely check that the backups are readable, and re-make them whenever there are signs of data corruption  
Encryption of the password / 2FA backups is also a good idea, but you need to also backup the decryption keys, and the decryption keys are also passphrase-encrypted, so you need to backup that passphrase separately  
**EDIT**  
Was just re-reading the link I posted  
It mentions choosing a font to avoid the ambiguity between 0OIl characters  
Encoding with Bitcoin base-58 (instead of base-64) before printing can help remove ambiguity when restoring from a faded paper backup - 0OIl are not in the base-58 character set  
It's also worth mentioning that the QR format has built-in error correction, giving a higher probability of legibility after ink fading, compared to printed text

The current implementation of pruning is fake pruning  
A new node still has to download the whole Blockchain from an unpruned node  
A new node still has to process every transaction in every block to build transaction indexes and address indexes  
After processing each block, the block is deleted from that node's Blockchain, to save space for that node  
The pruning method I linked to is completely different. It prunes fully spent transactions from their blocks  
Node initialisation using the current pruning method is slow because it processes every transaction for indexing  
The method described in bitcoin.pdf only processes transactions which have unspent outputs. It would be much faster

No proof  
The common misconception is that the outputs of a transaction are linked all its inputs. Sometimes this is true, due to the nature of simple purchase transactions - all the inputs and one of the outputs belong to the purchaser's wallet. But have a quick clickthrough some recent transactions at the blockchair.com explorer. Any transaction with many inputs and many outputs is untraceable, because you can't safely assume all the inputs came from the same wallet, and you can't know who owns any of the outputs. Even in the simple example, you have no way to be certain which output address belongs to the merchant and which one is the sender's change address

That's the only way if there is no other way. For example, if you import a new key (or address) into a Core wallet, the wallet will rescan the Blockchain to discover the transaction history for that address. This is very slow  
Other ways:  
If you never import addresses, and never lose your wallet (make frequent backups) then your complete transaction history is always stored in your wallet  
If you run an ElectrumX server, it has an index which allows for instant lookup of transactions by address. Even if you don't run an ElectrumX server, if you use the Electrum wallet, it will connect to another person's server and build your transaction history every time you import new keys or addresses into an existing wallet or a new wallet  


Not important whether the system is centralised or not. All that matters is whether you have looked after your wallet and kept your transaction history, or whether you have access to an address index for instant lookup  


Every node has a UTXO database, which is much smaller than the Blockchain. Every new transaction has inputs which point back to the outputs they are spending. The UTXO database is an index of the unspent outputs, a way of instantly finding where a transaction is in the Blockchain, if you know the txID hash  
Most important, a node will reject a transaction if it has any input which points to an output that does not exist in the UTXO database. If it is missing from the UTXO database, the node does not go searching the Blockchain for it  
If an output is missing from the UTXO database that means either  
*    it does not exist on the Blockchain, or  
*    the output has been spent already. An output can be spent once only, no partial spends  


Too slow to build the address index for an ElectrumX server  
Too slow to rescan the Blockchain when you import a new address into a Core wallet  
Too slow to initialise a new node  
It is not too slow now. When it gets too slow, the Blockchain can be transaction-pruned, as discussed in the original White Paper. When this happens, everybody will have to look after their own transaction history, because old, fully-spent transactions will no longer be stored on the Blockchain forever

Do not point 2 different Bitcoin Core instances at the same data directory. The databases and the Blockchain will be corrupted  


You can. You have to change two port numbers to be different to standard - the node's network listening port, and the RPC interface port  


Slightly faster than previous Pi models. Still seriously constrained by a lack of RAM. 1GB is barely enough  


Depends on your definition of "low cost". Ideally, a dedicated Bitcoin node should have 2GB RAM (minimum - preferably 4GB), and a SATA interface. In the "single board PC like a Pi" space, nothing really fits that spec. Look at these:    
They're all more powerful than a Pi, but not a single SATA interface in the list. ODROID, Banana Pi, Orange Pi, same story, no SATA interface  
The Intel NUC fits, but is about 8 times the price of a Pi. It also had a bad reputation for abysmal performance, but would probably be adequate for a Bitcoin node

Stable coins are a temporary aberration. They enable cryptocurrency exchanges to operate without the burden of legal compliance  
Because regulation of cryptocurrency concentrates on fiat onramps, an exchange can avoid compliance requirements by not trading in fiat. Previously, this meant you had to buy Bitcoin from a regulated exchange, then trade Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies on non-regulated exchanges. The problem with this is that Bitcoin is sometimes volatile, so your trading strategy has to manage Bitcoin volatility as well as cross-rate volatility  
Stable coins allow a trader to exchange fiat for a fiat-proxy on a regulated exchange, and then trade across multiple cryptocurrencies on unregulated exchanges, removing the complexity of Bitcoin's volatility from the trading strategy  
Eventually, all exchanges will be regulated, due to increasing regulation and also closures and consolidation of less viable exchanges. If every exchange is regulated, then every exchange will accept fiat currencies. Stable coins will be obsolete

A zero-fee transaction will be rejected by any node you try to broadcast it to. If the fee is less than 1 Sat/byte your wallet will see an error message telling you the fee is too low  
The transaction effectively does not exist. There is nothing to cancel  
If your transaction has the minimum fee (1 Sat/byte), and Bitcoin becomes congested again, the transaction could remain unconfirmed for weeks. If you do not spend at least one input of that transaction in a separate transaction, then it could be mined and confirmed any time in the future, maybe years later. If some node operator or miner keeps a collection of old unconfirmed transactions, he can re-insert some of them into the mempool or into a new block whenever he wants

No, but there is an irrational belief that users love to keep the miners' families clothed and fed and will happily pay higher fees to make up for the declining block reward  
Increasing fees are an indicator that Bitcoin is congested. The natural response to this congestion is to spread out to other cryptocurrencies. When there is a choice of several uncongested cryptocurrencies, there is no reason for fees to ever increase - either on Bitcoin or on any other cryptocurrencies  
In the long term, fees will be zero everywhere, and mining will transition from a multi-billion business back to what it was a few years ago, a hobby

Taking a softer line on this  
Superficially, it's the merchant's fault for being too lazy to actually use Bitcoin. He chooses a payment gateway, as if it's "just another PayPal"  
But really, those things cancel out. The merchant isn't into Bitcoin. He's choosing a non-Bitcoin shortcut to accepting a handful of payments. It's not different to the merchant ignoring Bitcoin completely  
Not really the merchant's fault then  
It's nobody's fault  
Adoption is slow because innovation takes time for the mass of ordinary people - spenders and merchants - to see why Bitcoin is innovative, and make the effort to learn how to use it  
Adoption is not helped by the false perception in the nocoiner world that Bitcoin is just another make-money-fast scam. Who's fault is this? All those speculator parasites who infest these threads with "why are you spending? HODL!"  
I am patient. The speculation bubble will end. Adoption will follow. Merchants will come on board, because Bitcoin is not Visa, not PayPal, not fee-gouging middleman  
When? Not predictable. As with any innovation, those who understand the benefits early can see that it should have happened 5 years ago, and might be impatient. As with any innovation, adoption is not linear. Instead it follows a snail's pace until suddenly it acquires a chain reaction and grows exponentially. This trigger point can happen tomorrow, or we could be waiting until the 20-year anniversary

What is a "static address"?  
If "static address" means address reuse, then it is unacceptable  
To the substance: merchants converting to fiat, the frequent claim that BitPay is good because instant conversion of fiat is part of the BitPay merchant service, and the negative comparison against BTCPay Server, because this feature is missing  
I've always believed this is a straw man argument in favour of BitPay. It is presented in a way that BitPay is doing something which is not possible otherwise - you buy the merchant payment gateway service, and the conversion to fiat comes builtin. It is presented as though it is difficult for a merchant to open an account at a trading exchange and automatically sell every Bitcoin receipt as it arrives. BitPay, making your life easy!  
To my point:  
BTCPay Server has no obligation to provide fiat conversion, would be well advised to stay away from it. BTCPay merchants can make the effort to choose a trading exchange, sign up, and configure the exchange account for instant trade of every incoming Bitcoin amount

I was talking about the difficulty of orphaning and replacing more than a few blocks. As I said, the calculations are in the white paper. Please read it, Section 11  


An aversion to the majority of hypotheticals in this subreddit, because they are written by stupid and lazy people. If you can actually conceive of an attacker having $800 million worth of miners idle, waiting to launch an attack, and a spare 2 Gigawatts of power waiting to be commissioned, that's a delusion, not a hypothetical  
But then, many people failed mathematics in elementary school, science in high school, and have no clue how much $800 million is, or what a Gigawatt is. Those people need to catch up before posting here  


Unfortunately, the answer to this is not simple, and is most simply answered by reading the source code. It is not documented anywhere else  
The question to ask is "how does a node know it has a stale chain branch tip, and how does it work out how many blocks to chop from the tip and replace", because every node does this independently, and the only communication between nodes to to request and receive the replacement blocks after a node determines that it has a stale tip

This is not a Bitcoin issue. The general principles of password management have the same requirements - long, random, different password for every purpose, remember all your passwords  
  
Diceware is a nice tool because it gives you long and random - more than 80 bits of entropy protects against brute force - with only 7 words to memorise  
Of course, it is not realistic to expect people to remember dozens of 7-word passphrases for all the different login services they use. The current state of the art is to store passwords using password manager software. Unfortunately, all these apps have a reputation for forgetting passwords. Most people don't care, because they know there's a password reset by email only a few clicks away, and a phone help desk as an extra fallback  
Bitcoin does not have password reset by email or a help desk  
In the coming years, password resets by email and by phone help desk will be phased out because of the risks of interception and social engineering. The Mat Honan story will become more common, and liability issues will make reset services non-viable  
  
Given the unreliability of password manager apps, after password reset services are closed down, password management becomes an unsolved problem  
Bitcoin works because people are expected to know how to take responsibility for securing their own access credentials. If this expectation is unrealistic, then a social change is a prerequisite for Bitcoin adoption. To turn that around, some people know how to care for their passwords. These people can adopt Bitcoin. Everybody else can choose to learn the necessary processes, or can choose to ignore Bitcoin

The Merkle root hash is calculated using the Merkle tree. That is, it is validated using all the transaction hashes  
Transaction signatures are validated, but not for all blocks, depending on the configuration variable "assumevalid"  
The UTXO database is built from scratch, by processing all the outputs and all the inputs of every transaction in every block  
If you're modifying the transactions to mark the outputs spent, then you need to make the modification in a way which does not change the transaction hash - or change the calculation of the transaction hash so that it is not corrupted by your 'spent' flag  
By modifying the transaction, you're violating the immutability of the Blockchain. Presumably this is why your transaction hashes are incorrect  
I'm not saying you're wrong to want a spent flag for transaction outputs. But you should consider the consequences carefully  
Apart from the immutability issue, you're changing something which works. Currently, a node knows an output is spent if the UTXO database contains no entry for that output. If you add an explicit 'spent' indicator, what are you doing to ensure that your list of unspent outputs - the outputs not marked as spent - is the same as the set of UTXOs in the UTXO database? What would you do if there is a discrepancy between the two lists?  
Random suggestion: maybe you can make a spentTXO database instead of marking the transaction. Index it by txID and output number. Store the txID and input number of the transaction which spends the output. This DB will be big  
Coming full circle, you probably don't need a 'spent' flag at all. Look up the UTXO database. If the output isn't in the UTXO database, then it is already spent

A BIP39 12-word seed is 132 bits. There are 2048 words in the list, so each word represents 11 bits: 2^11 = 2048 and 12*11 = 132  
The last 4 bits are a checksum  
This means there are 128 bits of entropy  
The minimum entropy to be safe from brute force is considered to be 80 bits, which means about 7.3 words. Four words would be only 44 bits, crackable with a rented GPU from AWS

When I studied politics, anarchy was small communities governing themselves. Human behaviour as it is, small groups can be more tyrannical than the giant One Party rule of a large nation. The inefficiency of large bureaucracies is an accidental form of individual freedom  
Another principle of anarchy is for groups to disband when their original purpose becomes obsolete. To the extent this can happen, it would mitigate the tyranny of the group against the individual

This scam has been common for a few months now. It is a type of [Advance fee fraud](  
You join a "mining scheme", and then you're told that you have mined 0.9 Bitcoin, but the minimum withdrawal amount is 1.2 Bitcoin. Please top up your account with 0.3 Bitcoin so you can claim your mining rewards  
Then you send 0.3 Bitcoin and there was no 0.9 Bitcoin. The scammer keeps your coins

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

Any algorithm can be implemented in CPU. Write a few lines of code, compile the code. An ASIC designer (or maybe a FPGA designer) analyses the instruction sequence in the compiled code, then puts those instructions into the hardware design for an ASIC  
Therefore, there is no such thing as a CPU-only algorithm  
A couple of random thoughts:  
*    design a self-speed-limiting algorithm, similar to the Bitcoin difficulty adjustment, but implemented in real-time on every single miner. The hard part would be adding a component to proof of work which also proves that the miner did not cheat the speed limiter  
*    use many hashing algorithms at the same time, each miner can choose one from a list of, say, 30. Develop a difficulty adjustment mechanism which gives equal weight to each algorithm. This way, a CPU miner at the current hash rate for his chosen algorithm has the same chance of mining a block as the Antminer S15 mining SHA256 at 28TH/s

Built-in automatically adjusting difficulty, an obvious disincentive to adding more and more hashing power, an obvious disincentive to investing in faster and faster ASICs, yet people keep doing it  
Also, just say you had a contract which shows break-even at 16 months, and steady profit after that, ignoring all the unpredictable elements  
You mine for 16 months, and the rate of return matches your plan, finally you break even, look forward to your future profits  
But you forgot, your contract allows the mining provider to switch off your ASICs at any time

Read the contract  
Last time I read a contract, the cloud company was accepting a one-time payment for a specified amount of hashing capacity  
The big catch in the contract was the indeterminate period  
They can turn your ASICs off at any time  


My calculation showed a 16-month break-even, for technology which is obsolete in less than 16 months. No profits in that scenario  
Also, mining can never show a long-term profit while the amount of hashing capacity continues to increase. The proof of work difficulty factor automatically adjusts up and up, reducing the revenue per THash all the time  
The simple act of buying a cloud mining contract and having your new ASICs added to the mining network reduces the profitability for your contract, as well as every other miner

Today, the software developers are custodians of the software, and there are multiple alternative node softwares  
The data is maintained by the node network. The UTXO database is built by scanning the Blockchain  
There may be value in trusting UTXO database snapshots and hashes, because building the UTXO database is the slowest part of node initialisation  
However, I do not want to trust the software developers to be the trust custodians of the UTXO snapshot hashes. This data does not belong in the software  
When there is a standard format for dumping the UTXO database, and someone develops the software for dumping the UTXO database in that standard format, any node operator can publish the UTXO snapshot and hash for any block height  
Then, anybody looking for a shortcut for node initialisation can choose to trust one of these UTXO snapshots. Do not expect the software developers to be the custodians of trust in the data  
Finally, this thread is missing any discussion about why there is a serious trust issue in using a third-party copy of the UTXO database. A corrupt UTXO database could create a double-spending opportunity. A thief can re-add spent TXOs to the UTXO database, eventually become the most trusted source of UTXO snapshots, and then double-spend

This false all-or-nothing assumption, every time this question is asked  
If Bitcoin mining profitability falls, some miners will stop, not all miners  
Bitcoin automatically adjusts mining difficulty down, making the cost of mining much cheaper  
In the early years of Bitcoin, mining was a hobby, miners were altruistic. This proves that miners do not need a financial reward. Bitcoin mining will return to being a hobby  


Miners do not charge fees. Transaction senders choose how much fee to pay. By the time the block reward falls to zero - in 120 years - there will be many coins operating in parallel with Bitcoin. Fees will be zero

I agree that side chains can increase throughput, but there is a huge cost. Lightning channels will be centrally controlled - most likely will be run by Bitmain, PayPal and Visa  
Here's an alternative suggestion, which keeps the network decentralised, and scales as required by transaction volume:  
Reduce the blocksize so that millions of devices are technically able to run a full node  
Clone hundreds (eventually thousands) of parallel networks and blockchains to achieve the scale required for the volume of transactions

I was under the impression that the dust limit was a spending constraint, that you can't spend a dust output. When you spend an output it becomes an input  
Anyway, when the mind is confused by ambiguity, after reading the same discussion worded slightly differently on 12 different forum threads ...  
Read the source  
Sure enough, right there in policy.cpp it definitely applies the dust limit amount to the outputs, not the inputs  
I was wrong, you are right  
Nodes will reject transactions which create dust outputs  
but there is nothing to stop you spending (or consolidating) all your dust outputs, even if the fees wipe out the value of your dust  
cf.   
lines 118-133 define a loop which checks each output  
lines 129-131 trigger the rejection of a transaction if one of the outputs is dust  
The lower level logic is in functions IsDust() and GetDustThreshold() which are in the same source file

No, you should be buying S17, not S9. The S9s are available second-hand, cheap because they will soon be so slow that you will make zero Bitcoin with them. This is because the more power-efficient S17s will drive up the Bitcoin mining difficulty to the point where a S9 will not be able to contribute to any mining pools

Limited supply is a myth  
Bitcoin is only one cryptocurrency  
As the use cases become more widely adopted, more coins will be launched to satisfy the increasing demand  
Bitcoin will be one of many coins  
Even limited supply does not justify a price higher than $2. A typical transaction requires purchasing a small amount of Bitcoin and spending it immediately. Then the merchant converts the Bitcoin to fiat. The supply of coins only needs to be enough to cover the period between the customer acquiring Bitcoin and the merchant selling Bitcoin multiplied by the average number of transactions for the average acquire, purchase, sell cycle multiplied by the average transaction value  


Here's mine:  
300,000 transactions per day  
Average one-day cycle  
Average purchase $20  
Bitcoin's total "market cap" only needs to be $6 million  
Seems my $1.20 guess is a bit high

More ...  
Web sites can only be banned using influence over the domain name system. Currently, there are at least 2 country-level domains which resist USA censorship demands. There is also at least one domain name registrar which allows anonymous registration and payment  
In future years, those 2 countries may succumb to USA "diplomatic pressure" and censor their domain names  
When this happens, the DNS system will have been corrupted enough to be obsolete. Some are already moving to Tor. You mentioned Pirate Bay, and there are at least 5 other file sharing sites which are accessible via Tor  
There is also a decentralised alternative DNS system driven by the Namecoin blockchain. To quote John Gilmore:

This is where the friction is  
People are not using Tether because it's a great currency to hold. They are using it as a fiat proxy for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges which do not accept fiat  
To a lesser extent, people are reluctant to redeem their Tether for fiat because nobody wants to trigger a run on Tether redemptions which would expose the shortage of fiat backing for Tether. Tether is fractionally reserved, and as long as no massive redemption run happens, it's business as usual  - buy Tether for USD1, redeem Tether for USD1

If I don't worry about inputs, my wallet might send transactions like this  
  
15 dirt inputs, and the fee more than 4 times the size of the outputs  
If I want to worry about inputs, I could choose to manage every key separately, hand-crafting every transaction to minimise fees  
Wallets are for people who don't have the time or the mental capacity to hand-craft transactions, a task which is error-prone, and where errors can cause huge losses  
What would be useful, is a wallet which lets you pick and choose which inputs to use, without the intense mental effort of hand-crafting a transaction  
On a low-fee day, I might decide to add my two least valuable dirt addresses to the inputs, just to get rid of them, but only if the additional fee doesn't wipe out the value of those inputs  
There is a way to do this without hand-crafting transactions  
Create a fresh (non-HD) wallet, import only the addresses you want to spend, and the wallet can only use those addresses to make the transaction  
Less error-prone and less time-consuming than hand-crafting transactions, although more time-consuming than blindly letting the wallet choose for you  
These suggestions treat every address independently, so they don't work so well for the deterministic wallet fans, with their ledgers and trezors and seed phrases engraved in locked steel plates

Spying is already a problem, but that's not the issue here  
If anybody has a reason to keep a full archival copy of the Blockchain, they will have to make the effort to maintain their own copy, because it may become more difficult to find full archival nodes in the live network. I imagine the lead developers and the large exchanges might see a need to keep a full archive  
The point is that Bitcoin does not need to store fully spent transactions. They have no role in consensus. A new transaction can only spend a UTXO  


The Blockchain is tied up in unforgeable hashes. Transaction pruning does not weaken this  


This discussion asks the same question, but goes nowhere  
There is one passing mention of the time it takes to initialise a node, as if it's not important

It is described in Satoshi's White Paper as a partial hash collision. In that document, the target hash is required to have a **minimum number of leading '0' bits**. Matching the required minimum leading '0' bits is a partial hash collision, the leading zero part of the hash is the same  
Bitcoin's current target hash is implemented as a **maximum integer value**, because counting leading zeroes makes the target adjustment too coarse - can only be adjusted by a power of 2 amount. In principle, the current mechanism is the same as Satoshi's specification, but allows for finer adjustments. This means it is not really a partial collision in the same sense

It still makes no sense, the fee amount is not part of the transaction data, because it is the result of subtracting the output amounts from the input amounts  
You can not change the fee of an existing transaction without either adding more inputs or changing the output amounts - and then it would be a different transaction

Difficulty is a distraction here, see below  
The mechanism is slightly simpler than your wording  
The block header is an 80-byte summary of the contents of the block  
The block header is hashed  
If the hash's integer value is less than the target, then it wins  
If not, modify something which changes the block header hash - nonce, extranonce, or even the transaction set - then try again  
Repeat a few million trillion times  
Difficulty is a calculated number with an inverse relationship to target. The arithmetic used to calculate difficulty makes it easy for observers to estimate the hash rate required to find a hash less than the current target. Difficulty has only this purpose - for external observers to have a number which increases with hash rate  
The target decreases when hash rate increases (and vice versa), using a time-based mechanism described in another comment in this thread  
The mining and consensus processes compare the block header hash with the target. They have no interest in the difficulty number

Playing Devil's Advocate here, do not take any of this literally, although these are real issues ...  
Bitcoin has already failed  
It is burdened with a set of parameters which limit its transaction throughput to 3 transactions / second  
Having now reached this limit, a snowballing fee market has arisen, making Bitcoin too expensive for many use cases  
The planned scaling improvements will lift the throughput to about 10 transactions / second, an incremental improvement, when a large order of magnitude improvement is required - to "exist next to the Euro as a currency" would require a capacity of thousands of transactions per second  
The standard response to this scaling issue is "Bitcoin will be a settlement layer, and side chains will handle huge transaction volumes". Side chains are centralised, they will probably end up being controlled by Bitmain, Visa and PayPal  
The existing Core developer group has no other scaling plans  
Rival groups have ridiculous scaling plans - bigger and bigger block sizes

This is a fact, and probably the main determinant of the minimum memory requirement to run a full node  
Nobody ever questions this, it is always presented as an axiom:  
* The network will fail unless nodes keep the full UTXO set in memory  
* Blocks will propagate too slowly to all nodes if the UTXO set is moved to a disk database, because the cumulative latency to fully propagate blocks to all nodes will exceed the block interval time  
I challenge this assumption, because it is a constraint that limits the options for scaling Bitcoin  
Move the UTXO set out of memory, into a simple B-Tree index on disk, profile any undesirable latency, develop optimisation techniques to reduce latency, prove me wrong, or not

Interesting comparison  
I have believed since the founding of Wikileaks that Julian's self-promotion is misguided. It's an old-media thing - the face behind the brand. Some critics might blame Assange's ego  
In hindsight, Wikileaks should have been launched and operated completely anonymously  
Its replacement will not make the same mistake  
Of course, it's easy to say these things in hindsight. Wikileaks is 3 years older than Bitcoin. In 2006, it was less obvious that the PR concept of "face behind the brand" is obsolete.

Money is not important. It has a utilitarian purpose - to establish a common basis for pricing disparate goods and services  
In an economy of vast surplus, prices are distorted by false value perceptions. If you have $1000 and you're not cold or hungry, then it makes no difference whether you waste your excess wealth on 1 iPhone or 2 Samsung phones. You might as well buy the iPhone because the value comparison is irrelevant - nobody actually needs 2 phones. Alternatively, buy one Samsung and $500 worth of Bitcoin at $14000/BTC.

But in those instances, the mining work is done, on both branches

So our Coinbase user can claim they have falsely accused him, because he sent his coins to Bitstamp, and his address was mixed in an internal Bitstamp transaction with an address of gambling service that also uses Bitstamp


Personally I do, and I don't use hosted wallets either,

Speak for yourself  
My analysis (not assumption) shows Bitmain has over-spent on the investment cost of developing new ASICs  
and is heading for a huge loss when the technology becomes obsolete before repaying the development cost

Here's a different path to scaling ...  
1MB blocksize (or smaller)  
More chains, more currencies  
Multiple parallel chains  
and then  
More blocks  
Lower fees  
If Bitcoin fees stay expensive, or become more expensive, more currencies will appear naturally  
Normal cryptocurrency users who want to buy and sell things are already moving to lower-fee coins  
Eventually there will be so many currencies, that none will have full blocks or high fees. Bitcoin will be one of the many  
Perhaps this violates the "One True Blockchain" view which is prevalent in this subreddit, but that stale view is the main cause of the current crisis

Maybe "if Bitcoin can exist next to the Euro as a currency" is the wrong question, since it reduces the opportunity to describe Bitcoin for what it is - new  benefits which fiat currencies can never have  
Go back to the first page of the bitcoin.pdf paper, the Introduction describes the problem of trust issues, transaction dispute overhead costs, and "the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services"  
In the physical world, these issues can be avoided by using cash  
Bitcoin was developed as the solution to the same problem for network transactions - to remove the fee cost imposed by the labour overheads of providing a transaction dispute process, and to remove the cost to merchants of fraudulent chargebacks  
There are only two parties in a transaction - buyer and seller - responsible for managing their own trust relationship, without help or interference from a Visa or PayPal dispute mechanism  
Having established that Bitcoin has the same benefits as cash, then you can consider whether it can go further, can be a currency in its own right  
How many people in your country actually use cash?  
In Denmark and Sweden, the use of cash is so low, that the Governments are considering banning cash in order to control crime  
In other European countries, you can not operate a shop which accepts cash unless the cash register is permanently connected to the Tax Office, reporting every cash transaction as it happens  
Are European people concerned that none of their transactions are private?  
They don't seem to care. Where is the incentive to adopt Bitcoin in a place where cash has been abandoned because convenience has become more important than privacy?  
Maybe in Europe, Bitcoin will replace cash as the currency for criminal transactions, when Denmark, Sweden and other countries ban cash

Not the whole  
The challenge is to separate the speculators from the Bitcoin users  
If someone says "adoption" they're probably a speculator, using a buzzword which they hope increases the price  
But if a Bitcoin user says adoption, he might actually mean "Let's fix the barriers which prevent merchants accepting Bitcoin online"  
Pro-regulation - speculator  
"Regulation is good for bitcoin because it makes it more acceptable to mainstream" means more buyers and a price increase  
ETF - speculator  
"Something something institutional money" price increase

Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party

Recently installed this Linux version on a 2011 HP Mini Netbook, to give it new life. This Raspbian is a GUI Linux with a lightweight version of X-Window called Pixel, which in turn is a variant of LXDE

These questions are deconstructionalist  
The individual components of Bitcoin do not operate in isolation  
Bitcoin must have sufficient nodes to be protected from censorship, and must have sufficient nodes to prevent node operators conspiring to alter the Blockchain. The minimum is one, provided that node operator is inaccessible to regulators and other censoring agents, provided the node operator is honest, and provided that the node never stops operating  
and the other questions ...  
The block size, block interval (you forgot this one) and other operating parameters need to be set at a level which prevents new blocks being delayed by incomplete reorgs. A single event where a reorg is too slow to allow the next block to be validated and propagated would be enough to close down Bitcoin  
The current parameter settings have been in operation for 10 years, and this type of delay has never happened  
Ignorant "casuals" like yourself want to test the limits, but do not recognise that a slight miscalculation can cascade to an unrecoverable stall

Maybe if BCash somehow managed to start processing enough transactions to fill a 2MB block, its weaknesses will become evident. Similarly, if Litecoin (2.5 minute block interval) or Dogecoin (1 minute block interval) ever become popular enough to fill their blocks, it will be interesting to observe the point at which their orphan branch reorgs overtake the block interval  
Until then, it's safer not to change

This is not true. The size of the transaction depends on the number of inputs and the number of outputs. If you increase the amount, the transaction might need more input coins  
Use a wallet which lets you control the selection of coins and lets you choose your own fee  


If the network is uncongested, as it is right now, you should pay 1 Sat / byte. If your transaction has 1 input and 2 outputs, the transaction size will be less than 250 bytes and the fee will be less than 2 cents

assumevalid works because it avoids validating the signatures of old transactions. This saves time in the node initialisation process, and relies on the assumption that the signatures of old transactions do not need to be verified  
Building the UTXO database is not a validation. There are no shortcuts, no equivalent to assumevalid  
This is why people are suggesting checkpoints for the UTXO database. In a sense, checkpoints are analogous to assumevalid  
But UTXO checkpointing requires a mechanism for maintaining "official" checkpointed versions (snapshots) of a critical database - centralisation, no thank you  
The UTXO database could be built faster, by sorting transaction outputs, sorting transaction inputs and merge-processing the two lists. This could be 90% faster than the current block-at-a-time node initialisation process  
**BUT** it would require disk space at least as much as 2 copies of the full Blockchain  
Is there a way to save disk space? There was in 2008  
  
7. Reclaiming Disk Space  
Pruning fully spent transactions would make the node initialisation process faster. More importantly, it would make it sustainable for decades into the future, until the UTXO set grows so big that it eventually becomes unsustainable

"Destroy" depends on the behaviour of Bitcoin users, on unpredictable mass psychology. There could be a bug which allows theft of billions, and most Bitcoin users would shrug it off and remain optimistic  
Bitcoin's consensus logic does not allow new coins to be created except for the miners' block reward coins, and does not allow any coin to be spent more than once  
If there was a bug which allowed extra coins or allowed double-spending, and the bug was exploited, and the exploit was not discovered within about 10 blocks, then it would be impossible to reverse the fraud. Would this fraud destroy Bitcoin? See previous paragraph, mass psychology  


Yes and yes  
There was a double-spend bug discovered in 2018. The bug existed from 2016, was undiscovered for 2 years. It was never exploited, so it did no harm, luckily  
How likely?  
See incidents in 2010 and 2013  
Read the cause of the 2018 bug  
None of these should have happened  
As another comment says, software is complex, and undiscovered bugs always exist. On the other hand, the experiences of 2010, 2013 and 2018 should be enough to avoid similar errors in the future. Also, as complex as Bitcoin is, the consensus logic for preventing inflation (extra coins or double-spends) is a relatively small amount of code, and should be simple for everybody to understand  
The 2018 bug was caused by an unintended side-effect of a minor "go faster" improvement in another part of the code. Hopefully, future changes will be carefully checked for unintended effects on the important consensus rules

Keep a Web page up to date with the current fees and exchange rates of your machine  
Publish the rules of use on the Web page - ID requirements, transaction limits  
Read the Bitcoin ATM threads on this subreddit

If it's "too expensive" and they don't discover your rate until they turn up, you'll get complaints and bad reviews

The math you don't get is a proper understanding of the difference in scale between Mhashes/sec, Ghashes/sec, Thashes/sec, Phashes/sec and Ehashes/sec

Tragic  
The other guy and I, and dozens of now-retired Redditors before us, have been campaigning against the middleman payment processor for a long time  
Why?  
Bitcoin is a person-to-person payment system. The middleman has no legitimate purpose  
Yes, I've seen the "but what about adoption" response 1000 times now  


and that huge travel site, which no longer accepts Bitcoin  
and that giant gaming company, which no longer accepts Bitcoin  
These 5 companies, and at least 10 more, are (or were) all using BitPay or CoinBase Commerce. These giant corporations, with armies of in-house software developers, can not put a team of 3 coders aside for a few months to develop their own Bitcoin wallet for online sales. Because they don't care about Bitcoin. They are not interested in adoption. They'll take it if it's offered and drop it at the slightest inconvenience  


Right  
And I follow these shops for months after they announce "Hey! We accept Bitcoin". Most of them remove Bitcoin from their Web Checkouts after about 2 months. No adoption here  
On the other hand  
As points out, from a spender's PoV, it's sometimes a question of lack of choice, like my 2 recent purchases  
*    My Usenet provider needed a new annual payment, accepts Bitcoin, but it's BitPay. I don't see any alternative providers claiming "Bitcoin, without a third party!". Thanks to and  I get to bypass the BitPay invoice, choose my own fee, make them wait 12 hours for confirmation, and my Usenet service is good for another year  
*    The VPN annual payment is also due. In this case the provider claims they have their own wallet and they accept over 40 cryptocurrencies. I've spent all my Bitcoin, so I pay this one with Litecoin. It turns out they have their own Bitcoin wallet, but they use Coinpayments for other currencies. Shame, but at least Coinpayments doesn't have BitPay's predatory nickel-and-dime fee gouging or an impenetrable invoice URL  
One more point, which is rarely discussed  
There are two paragraphs on the first page of Satoshi's White Paper describing the transaction censorship problem (as well as the dishonest chargeback problem)  
Few people know that a merchant can not sell digital signal analyzers online, because it is on the banned product lists of the centralised payment processors, for obscure reasons relating to cracking the copyright protections built into game consoles  
Digital signal analyzers are essential devices for diagnosing faulty digital equipment. They are not just hackers' toys  
**BitPay bans its merchants from selling digital signal analyzers**  
Bitcoin does not censor any transactions. That is the main reason Satoshi invented Bitcoin

So your hypothetical is that some miner with eight hundred million dollars worth of new miners (and a brand new secret two gigawatt power station) is suddenly going to start mining a secret Bitcoin branch  
This subreddit probably has about 10 of these 51% attack hypotheticals every week  
Normally these 51% hypotheticals express concern that existing miners might conspire to remove their hash power from Bitcoin, mine a secret branch chain, then orphan the main chain's branch tip with their own branch - as if nobody would notice  
It would be more interesting to ask this question somewhere else, where it actually happened  
  
Your questions are answered there. No, it's not necessary to build a 1000-block secret branch. As long as there is a buyer accepting zero-confirmation transactions, an attacker can "double-spend" to defraud that buyer with a single replacement block  
Why was there a miner, previously unknown, with enough hash power to dominate the BGold mining network for a few hours? There are people who know the answer to that, but they refuse to discuss the question  
The other thing you should do is read the 51% attack calculations in the Bitcoin White Paper. They show that it gets **exponentially more difficult** to replace a chain tip branch, the longer it gets. Six blocks is almost impossible unless you control almost 100% of the hash power. 1000 blocks - never!  
If a 6-block-deep reorg is almost impossible, then all your discussion about changing mining difficulty becomes irrelevant. A 51% attack is never going to last long enough to have any impact on the difficulty

Not instant. Bitcoin will always be limited to transactions where it is convenient to wait for the appropriate number of confirmations  
Alternatively, where a service can be provided for minimal cost and automatically canceled if there is a confirmation failure, zero-conf is safe to the extent that the merchant can afford the cost of providing the service for a short period and then auto-canceling it  
Network services such as VPN, cloud hosting, paywall access, and similar digital services are already available for Bitcoin payment, sometimes with "wait for confirmation" delays, sometimes with instant commissioning on order, and automatic cancellation on payment failure

Not so long ago, Mt Gox was the dominant exchange  
As it was the dominant exchange, most Bitcoin users trusted the exchange rates quoted by Mt Gox  
To exploit this trust, Mt Gox falsely inflated its quoted exchange rates,  
then used the arbitrage opportunity between the Mt Gox false rates and the lower rates at other exchanges,  
trading with its customers' Bitcoins and keeping the trading profits  
This fraud eventually ended spectacularly when the "real" exchange rates moved faster than Mt Gox could trade  
The trading losses exceeded the value of all the coins Mt Gox was holding for its customers

For reference:   
This, and the later document on bitcoin.org provided here by show that the process is a bit complicated for operating an offline wallet  
The cold wallet is offline, so it has no way of knowing the amount of funds available to each private key  
Reading through Greg's example, the process requires jumping from online wallet to offline wallet and back again several times  
Code only gets written if there is a coder willing to write it, and this is more likely if there is demand for the function  
Your "average joe" has chosen other methods to manage his offline wallet  
I agree it's worth doing, because I'm not a fan of the popular hardware wallets, and the method described in the examples requires creating raw transactions, an error-prone technique where a small error can have large financial consequences

Greedy miners will retire. They will be replaced by altruistic miners  
Bitcoin is processed by thousands of non-mining nodes. They receive no financial reward. Their incentive is the health of Bitcoin, and the security of their own transactions  
The main purpose of mining is to create a 10-minute delay between blocks, to give the nodes enough time to process and propagate each new block  
For years, Bitcoin mining was a hobby, paying pennies to the miners. Bitcoin mining worked then, created one new block every 10 minutes  
The current status of Bitcoin mining as a multi-billion business is temporary. It will soon return to being a penny hobby. Bitcoin mining does not need to be financially rewarded. Bitcoin keeps working either way

A coin is one output of a transaction, waiting to be spent. It is spent by making a new transaction. One of the inputs of the new transaction links back to the output being spent. That is the only 100% certain tracking link  
A coin can be spent only once  
The inputs of the new transaction are not linked to its outputs, except by inference - a one-input, 2-output transaction has a good chance of being a simple purchase transaction, and one of the outputs is a change coin, belongs to the same wallet as the input  
(but not necessarily)

When the speculation price bubble eventually bursts, the price will stabilise according to Bitcoin's original intended purpose ...  
Bitcoin is a temporary token to buy and spend, receive and sell, a convenient method of online payment. The customer buys enough Bitcoin to purchase something online, spends the Bitcoin, then the merchant sells the Bitcoin  
There needs to be enough Bitcoin to cover the period between the customer buying Bitcoin and the merchant selling the same Bitcoin, multiplied by all the transactions for this period. Then the value of Bitcoin is a function of the average duration of the buy/spend/sell cycle, the number of transactions in this period, and the average transaction value
At 350,000 transactions per day, average transaction value $80, average buy/spend/sell cycle time 24 hours, Bitcoin's circulating supply needs to be worth about $28 million  
The Bitcoin fiat exchange price will stabilise somewhere between USD1 and USD2

The simple (but vague) answer  
  


Some details about the "magic" below  
A related answer, relevant to your own node only  
  
As said, even if you delete your unconfirmed from your own node, it may still exist in other nodes  
As you've mentioned a couple of times, the answers to the unconfirmed transaction mempool expiry question are inconsistent  
There is no simple "correct" answer to "when can I replace an unconfirmed transaction"  
If you submit a replacement transaction to a node which already has the original transaction, it should reject the replacement, unless you chose RBF  
If you submit a replacement transaction to a node which has expired your original, that node will accept your replacement, but it may be unable to relay the replacement to its neighbours if they still have the original. This can stop the replacement from getting to a miner's node. It follows that you may be able to submit a replacement to your own node, but it may be blocked from relaying any further  
At the user end, most wallets will refuse to broadcast a replacement. Some wallets, including the Core wallet, have a function to cancel a transaction, but this function is only available after a time. This limitation can be bypassed by using a different wallet to send the replacement - but that practice comes with a lot of warnings  
Unconfirmed transaction mempool expiry time ...  
Not as simple as 3 day vs 14 days vs whatever config is used by each individual node  
If a mempool is full, lowest fee transactions are deleted to make space for new transactions  
Transactions which have been deleted might be rebroadcast, by your own wallet, or by a variety of rebroadcast services  
As said, relaying and expiring unconfirmed transactions is not part of the consensus protocol  
Most of the discussion assumes every node runs Core and most nodes run Core with the default relay settings and mempool expiry settings. Sometimes the exceptions make this assumption irrelevant. For example, you might send a transaction with a 1 Sat/byte fee during a busy period, most nodes might delete your transaction for low fee when their mempools fill, but then some automatic rebroadcasting node re-inserts your transaction into the network  
The 14-day expiry setting is only relevant to transactions which have escaped the low-fee expiry logic  
Actual experience:  
In January 2018, Bitcoin blocks were full for several weeks, people were paying fees of $15 or higher. I'm not in a hurry, so this is an opportunity to experiment  
I submitted a transaction with a fee of 10 Sat/byte (not RBF). It failed to confirm. I tried to accelerate it using the ViaBTC Web form, but their free service was at capacity. I tried to submit a replacement with a fee of 11 Sat/byte, but it was rejected by all the nodes I tried because the original was still in their mempools. After 3 days this rejection stopped, and the 11 Sat version of the transaction was accepted, but then did not confirm - because I'm offering 80 cents of fee in a $15 fee market. I tried this a few more times, with different results. Sometimes the transaction disappears from mempools in 2-3 days, sometimes 6 days  
Eventually the "blockage" cleared, and backlogged transactions were finally being confirmed. My original 10 Sat/byte transaction was confirmed after 23 days, even though it was not in any mempool. A miner made a block from a collection of mempool-expired unconfirmed transactions between 20 and 40 days old  


mempoolexpiry=&lt;n&gt; Do not keep transactions in the mempool longer than &lt;n&gt; hours (default: 336)  
One hour appears to be the minimum

Transaction malleability is an issue pre-confirmation  


This depends on your perspective  
When you spend Bitcoin, or receive Bitcoin, do you ignore your transaction until it confirms? If not, then it is inconvenient to track your unconfirmed transaction's position in the mempool if some nodes have modified the transaction ID hash  
Transaction malleability is a problem for wallet developers, because it makes unconfirmed transactions harder to monitor. If a txID changes, then the wallet needs to follow the transaction by the UTXO pointers in its inputs

This is true  
The question relates to pre-confirmation behaviour, which is configurable by individual nodes, and by individual miners  
My experience is that submitting transactions to the network with fees less than 1 Sat/byte (I tried it about 10 times over a week during the Bitcoin congestion event in January 2018) is futile, because 1 Sat/byte is the default, and nodes configured to relay zero-fee transactions are so rare that they may as well not exist. Also, if you find a node which will relay a zero-fee transaction (or set up your own), it will be unable to relay your transaction to any of its neighbours. Then it's not likely to be picked up by any miners either, but that's not relevant to the OP's question  


If you know of any, then publish their node's IP address, so we can send all our zero-fee transactions to them

Exactly!  
There's a section in Satoshi's White Paper which describes a method for pruning fully spent transactions. I have been asking for 3 years, why has this never been implemented?  
A lot of comments say, "people will want the full chain so they can prove where every bitcoin came from". But this is nonsense, because it's not actually possible to trace every transaction backwards to "where it came from"  
There are spies (search for "chain analysis") who want complete Bitcoin transaction history so they can sell their spying services. But they can choose to keep full history for themselves even if all the normal users prune spent transactions  
I think some of the developers are scared of pruning old transactions just in case a bug in the pruning accidentally deletes the wrong transactions. More seriously, the Bitcoin system relies on nodes having an accurate UTXO database (unspent coins, the topic of your post at the top of this thread). At the moment this database is created by processing every transaction starting at the beginning, like this ...  
Start at block 1, add all the transaction outputs to the UTXO database. Read all the transaction inputs. For each input, delete the output it links back to from the UTXO database. This deleting from the UTXO database is important for preventing double-spending. Read block 2. Repeat  
After processing all the transactions in all the blocks, every output has been added to the UTXO database, and every spent output has been deleted from the UTXO database. We know the UTXO database is an accurate list of unspent coins  
How would this work if we have transaction pruning? A lot faster  
If a transaction is **fully** spent, then it has no UTXOs, therefore it is safe to prune it from its block (after it has lots of confirmations). And then, if the transaction has been pruned, its outputs never get added to the UTXO database of a freshly initialising node. They don't get added, so they don't need to be deleted, and the UTXO database is still reliable and accurate  
So, what are they scared of? This is a bit subtle, but important. We know the current process works reliably because we have 10 years of the history of Bitcoin to prove it. It is simple, because every spend causes a coin to be deleted from the UTXO database  
With pruning, a new node does not add then delete a spent output. The output does not exist because the transaction has been pruned. This means the accuracy of the UTXO database depends on the accuracy of the pruning rules, as well as the current UTXO "delete while spending" rule. This small amount of extra complexity is a potential source of bugs, risking the accuracy of the UTXO database  
There you have both sides of the question, as far as I've thought about it  
There is a related issue, but I think it is less important. Everybody is told that they can lose their wallet as long as they write down their seed words. The seed words can recreate a lost wallet at any time. Great, your keys are always safe! Also, when you rebuild a wallet from seed, you also get back your transaction history, magically extracted from the Blockchain  
If transaction pruning is implemented, the Blockchain does not have full history, so you can not recover transaction history when you restore a wallet from seed words. The solution to this is that users have to keep backups of their transaction history, if they need it. A lot of people don't need history of their own full spent transactions. I suggest wallet developers should implement a function to back up transaction history  
Would users remember to back up, and look after these backups? If not, is this a reason not to implement transaction pruning?  
To repeat: There's a section in Satoshi's White Paper which describes a method for pruning fully spent transactions. Why has this never been implemented?  
Aside from all the "should we / should we not" issues discussed above, there is one really simple answer. If anybody thinks pruning spent transactions is important, to reduce the Blockchain size and the node initialisation time, then they can code it themselves. Satoshi's design is clearly written. Volunteer, write the code, test it, release it. If it reduces initialisation time from 12-20 hours down to 30 minutes, then it will be instantly popular

Bitcoin does not have accounts  


You can not do that. The Blockchain only records the receiving addresses of the transaction outputs and the public keys of the transaction inputs. It can not tell you which addresses are in any wallet  


That transaction breaks the rule against address reuse, so it tells you that two of the input addresses are the same as one of the output addresses. The other three addresses could be owned by 3 completely different people

Karpeles has already admitted in court that the Willy trading bot existed  
He appeared in this subreddit a few months ago "ask me anything", but refused to discuss questions about trading for his own profit  
Personally, I don't buy the market manipulation conspiracy which gets attached to this discussion  
Even more, I reject the false blame that all the coins were stolen by Vinnik  
*    I believe that Karpeles was profiting for himself by arbitrage trading his customers' coins  
*    I believe that Karpeles exploited Mtgox's position as the dominant exchange to falsely publish inflated Bitcoin exchange rates, to enhance his arbitrage profits  
*    I believe that Karpeles found his arbitrage on the wrong side of an unpredicted price movement, causing the loss of a large amount of customer coins. He then tried to trade out of these losses for several months, making them much worse  
These accusations align with the charges described in the coindesk article at the top of this thread  
The onus is now on Karpeles to explain his trading in detail

More interesting  
The block does not stay the same while mining is in progress  
Some pools allow miners to choose some of the transactions for the block they are mining  
The pool sends a set of transactions to the miner. The miner calculates the Merkle tree and Merkle root hash of the transaction hashes. The miner changes a number (called nonce) in the block header about 4 billion times - this takes about a quarter of a second  
Next ...  
The miner changes some non-transaction data in the block reward transaction, by generating some random bits. This changes the hash of that transaction, so the miner has to recalculate the Merkle root hash in the header. Then he does another 4 billion hashes, changing the nonce  
Sometimes ...  
Every 20 seconds or so, the miner reports progress to the pool manager and might get a new set of transactions for his next 20 seconds of mining  
Some pools ...  
Some pools allow the miner to choose some of the transactions. Where the miners choose to do this, they are all mining different blocks  
The near future ...  
The BetterHash mining protocol will allow all miners to choose all their own transactions instead of receiving transactions from the pool manager. This removes control of the transaction selection from the small number of pool managers. Individual miners will be able to use any transaction selection criteria they want
