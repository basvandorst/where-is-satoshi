Theoretically, it would give a more balanced representation.  As it stands, the cities can basically control the entire state.  I'm sure that's all fine for you if you support the cities but there is a lot of rural area to CA too which ppl tend to forget about.
It would work rather well actually, *if* the fed didn't have such a huge dick to swing around.  I would honestly prefer that we go back to United *States* where states have more rights but we're too far gone now.
To related it to bitcoin, some states are much friendlier to crypto than others.  *IF* I were to become a crypto bigshot I would probably move to the one most accepting of crypto.  Unfortunately, there's only so much a state can do (which is good and bad) but ultimately, say you live in CA and it broke into 3.  Say one was totally against crypto, another was.  While you can't just up and move, you might start eyeing one over the other.

not sure that is a thing..
patriotism isn't collectivism, collectivism goes against individualism.  
patriotism simply means you support your country, you can certainly do that while being individualistic.
Again, some of the most patriotic people I know live alone, in fear/distrust of the government.

ah ok lol, just checking! Yea, its hard to decide :/ I heard those stories too a few months ago
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:08:47
and for most of history, there were only peasants and kings.  Tribalism and religious fanaticism.  That's a useless comparison.
it was like that as there weren't enough resources to efficiently deal with it.  I have no doubt in my mind that *if* it could have been done it would have been done.

this is what I don't understand.  The biggest "patriots" I know hate the government and don't trust it at all.
but everyone here saying patriotism = loving government

Thanks for the comment!
Ironically, I'm just trading atm and I would like to move to just one exchange as fees are based on volume.  It may seem cheap, but when it comes to it Kraken vs Bistamp, kraken almost knocks it down by 33%, which can make losing trades not suck as much lol.  Also makes your winners a bit better but I like my tight stop losses lmao.
I love my ledger btw! Its just empty right now :( waiting for the next bull, then maybe pick some coins that aren't too volatile to keep!

So your vote is for Kraken?  Yea, I've had them for small orders and they seem ok, Bitstamp has been "fluid" and I really like their order system.
Dumb question, but I haven't had a chance to try it, is their trade view (through cryptowatch), does it have orders you can view live?

Could literally say the same thing about family.

Stuff like this will always be some of the most ironic thinking I've ever witnessed.
 - Governments are bad, corrupt and evil
 - We should just have a "world" with only one Government
I just don't get it.  Same people that say Governments are corrupt advocate for less nationalism and more globalism.  As if consolidating all countries into one government wouldn't just make it 100x easier for the corrupt to pull bullshit.
@_date: 2018-04-14 07:07:08
that's a bit different than removing the concept of borders and advocating for a one world government
there's so many cogs that turn the world, a blanket "free market" would decimate smaller countries.  Only problem I have right now is governments are a bit too manipulatable

I wouldn't even be mad tbh.
hate how the whole state is at the mercy of the cities.  Its kinda bs sometimes.  Even more so when you disagree with them.
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:20:48


implying everyone else doesn't adjust their prices to match FIAT
I honestly don't mind places that price based on the hour/5 min volatility.  I wouldn't mind having a "hot wallet" of crypto for paying for things.. until you can pay rent with crypto I'm sure FIAT will be here for awhile.
In the long run though, I'm sure it will at least be pretty widely adopted/solid.

hey, if banks can create more money than exists pretty sure crypto can too, lmao
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:44:49


literally globalists lol there's people out there that say there should be no borders and all sorts of stuff


so globalism?  You can be for individualism AND be patriotic.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:30:02
lmao, that's by design.  If people want to give them value more power to them.  That's inherently different, as people have to buy to give them value.
