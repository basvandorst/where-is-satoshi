We are trying to renew good relations with our users. We completely reform the support center and ask our users to participate in the creation and improvement of services. Unfortunately, all these years, Coinsbank paid little attention to the opinions of customers, now we have completely changed our team and are ready for change! Yes, we see hundreds of negative reviews about Coinbank, and we try to respond to most of them! Therefore, we regret that we have caused inconvenience to many users!

Your last request to the support team was on March 12, and our team responded to this letter. If you have any questions, write in support again.

Sorry for such a late reply. **Coinsbank** is an absolutely legal company. You can use our services quite calmly. Unfortunately, in January we had problems with bank cards due to problems with Wavecrest, but we are working on this issue.

The Coinsbank team wants to apologize for the delay in answering your questions. Now we are reforming our services, and we hope that in the future, such problems will not happen again.

We absolutely do not know why you draw such conclusions. We had little difficulty in working with cards and, we want to assure you that there is absolutely no reason to call us scammers. If you have specific suggestions or observations by our work, we are always open to dialogue.
