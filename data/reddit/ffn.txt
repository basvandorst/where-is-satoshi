No, I should add that Warren Buffet has stated that [buying BRK.A was one of the worst investment decisions he's ever made](

I believe this only makes my point stronger? Warren Buffet is the type of guy who gets a 28,000% ROI, and decides that he could have done better than that. It's outrageous to think that he doesn't know a thing or two about investing.

Past volatility is a pretty good indicator of future volatility and that's where Monte Carlo really shines. I would be super surprised if the S&amp;P 500 moves by 10% tomorrow, but not at all surprised if BTC moves by 10% tomorrow and that's based completely on history.
The problem is assuming that historical mean returns is an indicator of future mean return.

That would definitely be a reasonable explanation for why. The point is that I don't even have to know why or think about why to see that the past volatility are drastically different between the two and make a guess that this will continue in the future.

ITT: people who bought a fraction of a BTC at $11,000 make fun of a guy who bought hundreds of thousands of shares of BRK.A at $11.
^BRK.A ^is ^currently ^worth ^$310,000 ^per ^share.

Buffett is a big fan of companies that have quality cash flows that, based on his estimates, are priced lower than they should be. Note that there are thousands of companies and investment vehicles that don't have these properties that have made massive gains on the market. Even though there are many successful investments outside of his preference, he's been extremely successful and consistent with his own method.
Buffett wouldn't invest in Bitcoin because Bitcoin isn't an example of a discounted source of consistent cash flow.  That isn't to say that Bitcoin is a bad investment, it's just not the type that Buffett likes.
Buffett has famously said that he would take 100 acres of farmland over the equivalent amount of gold, because over any amount of time, that gold produces nothing, but the farm produces something, and the owner will still have 100 acres of farm at the end. I think it's pretty safe to say that he'd rather have farmland over Bitcoins too.

Buffett has famously said in a letter to his investors that he would rather own a farm over the same value in gold. The reason is that the farm creates something over time and he would still have a farm at the end. A bar of gold will be a bar of gold as long as you hold it, and a Bitcoin is always going to be a Bitcoin, it won't create anything extra.
It's totally in line with his past actions to not like the Bitcoin, but that isn't to say that people haven't made money off of gold or Bitcoins in the past.

Canada is a physical place capable of producing physical goods if people invested in it.  The 1.8 trillion dollars that it's worth currently is intrinsically based on the fact that the country is capable of producing things.  Bitcoin value is completely based on speculation, there is no intrinsic value to the coin.
