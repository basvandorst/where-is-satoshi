Bitcoin-qt. It's telling me there is a fee. I have it set to pay no fee. I don't want to pay a fee. I literally don't care if it takes a week to send, but I won't send if it means paying a fee.

I wish I could. I'm more of a fan of Bitcoin and the people able to work with it. I'm curious how long it would take a beginner like me to get to the point where I could create something like that. Anyone have any idea how long &amp; where I should start learning?

One of the benefits is that it's not necessary because there is an inevitability or persistence that people will eventually be made aware of. Bitcoin works and it's not going anywhere.

To anyone who understands them I'd appreciate if you threw NXT in there as well. It seems like the three of them are very similar to me, but with NXT having a headstart and Ethereum not being out yet.
Anyone out there familiar with all three?

I'm at the point now where I don't give a crap about the FUD. If people want to believe that some hackers can print more Bitcoins and that's somehow worse than people printing dollars 24/7 so be it. I'm sick of explaining the concepts to people I'm trying to help who act like I'm trying to get them into a con. There's an inevitability to Bitcoin &amp; I don't really care when the tipping point is or how many people understand until then. As far as I'm concerned people can turn their noses up and I'll enjoy the relatively cheap Bitcoin prices.

I appreciate the feedback, and I've looked at the conditions for sending feeless transactions. Would any of you mind explaining to me how I would go about sending 1BTC w/fees, considering I didn't get from the links offered?

Thanks! I'll look into that. I imagine that it allows you to label each satoshi when received with the exchange rate at that time and then organize your wallet based on basis. You could spend a X gain satoshi &amp; offset it with an X loss satoshi and have no tax consequence.

Totally. Not only does it mean it's incorruptible, more in it for the participants, and potentially deprive some liars who claimed the lottery would be used to fund some specific purpose only to divert the existing funds to other projects, but also think of the draw to Bitcoins. The first time it was comparable to the largest lotteries it would be talked about nonstop. Then the second time. Then when it eclipsed any other lottery. At that point they may try to put the genie back in the bottle but people would know that they could either line up for their shot at $350,000,000.00 or they could finally do what they've meant to do for a long time.. figure out how to get their first bitcoins, and play for $1.4B worth of bitcoins (hopefully by that time there would be the optional benefit of know one else having to know about it). If that's true think of what that does for the value of bitcoins too. I imagine there will be other people out there who would never waste bitcoins on something as foolish as a lottery and so these new participants would be using a % of the existing bitcoins to gamble with. Once the pools approached the largest lottery pots that people are used to draws more people to play I see it drawing a lot of new people to bitcoin &amp; driving value up.

Would it be possible to have a decentralized lottery pick a random winner around 2pm GMT, Saturday? Would it more likely just have to be at some set interval, and not necessarily at specific time &amp; day? Like every 168 hours from the time it was launched, maybe? I imagined that the % contributed by an address would be the % chance that address had to win the pot. I also imagine people starting to bitch after it seemed like people capable of contributing the most were winning "all the time" until that one magic day when someone from some 3rd world country who contributed a Satoshi wins hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. How cool would that be?!
I wonder if the participants could elect to share some bit of their info like their location. The winning address could post one of those messages on the chain saying something like "Oh shit! I won! I'm buying an NFL team!".. or maybe more likely a soccer team. The winner would hopefully have the option of keeping their mouth shut and secretly being one the wealthiest people on Earth or outing themselves &amp; sharing 60% with their favorite government to become instantly famous. It's fun to think about the possibilities that could come of it.

I'm sorry. I really appreciate the offer but I can't do this now. Thank you for your offer!

You can mine NXT now.. sort of.

I was thinking more along the lines of a global lottery with record payouts that people can participate in by buying a chance.. not buying &amp; maintaining a bunch of mining equipment for a shot at a tiny fraction of the amount that most people don't care much about. A global weekly lottery paying out a billion dollars worth of bitcoins would be an event.

Thanks. Would me setting up a full node have any effect on the size? The number of connections is related, isn't it?

I agree that I'd rather see people make sound financial decisions..  but I do love the idea of neutering the official lotteries from raising tons of death &amp; destruction money (or replacing their non-war budgets with lottery funds, and using the originally money for imperialism).
The neat thing about a huge DAP lottery.. the biggest.. is it would cripple the lesser ones.

That description, and the graph, reminds me of when that dude in Goodfellas partnered with the mob, and they took his business for all it was worth.. and when there was nothing else, they burned it down.

I had [this idea]( for a DAP type lottery a while ago.
I was fascinated by the possibility of the largest payouts ever, being the first global lottery..  How massive it could get, and the possibility of the winner saying nothing, just commenting anonymously, or becoming a huge celebrity.
My idea was for each satoshi, or smallest unit, to be a chance.  That way some might pay in 10BTC worth for millions of chances, or a few satoshis for a few shots in hell.
I also had an idea..  not sure how feasible this would be.. but the ability to enter in an address with each satoshi/chance for a secondary pot that would be awarded to the address entered the most (so a vote). The address paying in gets a chance to be randomly selected for 99% of the pot, and 1% goes to whichever address is nominated the most.  The idea being that the lottery can also be used for a charitable cause.  Whether it be Shawn's Outpost, a guy who has to walk many miles a day, the creator of the DAP, some fallen hero's defense fund, our your own address (I'm guessing that would have virtually no chance of winning, unless of course you fall into one of those other categories).
The whole reasoning for the vote is to avoid paying a fixed % to any static address that could be lost, stolen, etc..  This way it's future proof to an extent.
I love this idea, and I wish I had the skills to make it happen.  It would be so much fun to watch that tipping point happen, and the year of press.
Of course, it would have to have a totally presumptuous name like "The Lottery".

People think this was to solve the financial crisis.. and it was. Just not for most.
They just called TO, and stole money from everywhere for themselves, and their allies..  ready for "time in"?
