Confidentially cool
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:46:07
Sounds cool
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:24:02
I'd definitely be interested in it, but can't say I've heard of bazaar. Care to enlighten?
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:34:34
Thanks I definitely appreciate it! Typically I prefer to use a black/white/gray palette like with my [HODL]( shirt, so this was a bit new for me

Are OP and his ex cool people?
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:20:12
If anyone is interested this design is visible on my storefront [here]( along with some other designs like scarves, clocks, stickers, and shit.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:36:30
Haha thanks! Sadly I don't have much other work at the moment other than my [HODL]( design. I really like making crypto merch though so I'll probably be making new designs sometime.

Haha yeah I debated that, but the message is a bit of a double entendre in that bitcoin has no borders, and neither do the letters I used. I feel that a white shirt best showed this in allowing the letters to bleed into the shirt.

Never been called slick before. Am I finally one of the cool kids?

Bitcoin never closes my man

Definitely appreciate the feedback. While the white parts of the flag bleeding into the shirt was more of a design choice at the cost of readability, the bottom text being 'unsure' is something I overlooked in the initial designing phase. I went ahead and [fixed]( that part.
Again, thanks for the feedback!

Nothing to laugh about; you're spreading the invaluable knowledge of HODL

Coinbase is down right now. You know of any good alternatives for a noob who wants to make an account and start buying right away?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:19:45
Is it worth buying right now on the chance of selling for profit?
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:15:43
Who wouldn't?
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:58:48
That's way more likely
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:25:38
Like my mom.

I submitted a link further down

It's actually a direct quote from here: 
I had to decide between "fixing" it or leaving as is, and ultimately chose to leave it

I did try cex but sadly it's not available in arkansas
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:46:38
This is a shirt that I made!
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:06:54
I wanted to quote verbatim, and from the actual source he managed to correctly type hold: 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:47:19
Nice to see people enjoying my shirt! :)
For those interested

A stocking full of pennies

If you guys wanna see the shirt here it is (shameless)
 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:18:45
Yeah I thought about that but it seemed weird to define a word with the word
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:19:45
Here's the shirt from those who want to see it 
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:38:34
Np buckaroo. Glad you like it!
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:35:01
I agree, but I wanted to do a direct quote and sadly the only part wherein he misspelled it was the title which was hardly quotable.
