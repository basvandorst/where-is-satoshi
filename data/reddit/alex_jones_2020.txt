When you're buying stocks and mutual funds, you're investing that money into company(s).  The money is going back into the economy.  Much different from sitting on cash.
Unless you're buying apple stock.

r/btc really needs to be renamed to r/bch, just keep that in mind.

You'd be a fool to believe buying bitcoin is less risky than a diverse mutual fund. The probability of something better coming along and replacing bitcoin is much more likely than the entire economy collapsing. 
Treat bitcoin like it is, a very volitile high risk high reward investment.

A correction is when something returns to its proper value.  So say bitcoin is selling at 4k right now due to hype when it might actually only be worth 3500.  It dropping back to 3500 would be a correction. 
It makes more sense for stocks, since there's not really a way to know the proper value of a cryptocurrency.

Let's hope that's not the only reason.  That would make that the definition of a bubble.  Price skyrocketing for something useless with no intrinsic value. 
I think the idea is that eventually the price will stabilize, and it will be widely accepted as a currency with many advantages over fiat.

Thats a big assumption.  Why would there not be more than one cryptocurrency in use?
