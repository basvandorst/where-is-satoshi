That’s good. People are still buying that fake coin without even knowing what they are buying. I was talking to someone the other day who I was trying to convince against getting bcash, but he just said “well the price is going up so I should buy it”. I was surprised too since he has a few thousand in ether and btc.

I used them about a month ago to buy some bitcoin and litecoin. Fiat to crypto transfer took forever, but I made sure to send all my coin to a private wallet. If this is really the case for you, fuck them, but I wish you the best.

That’s pretty good! Did you rollover your previous account to your new job? It isn’t required but if you’re like me I like keeping my portfolio’s “organized”. But if the new jobs plan options suck, just leave it in the old account.
EDIT: Does your company match up to a percent?

That makes sense. I do have a paper wallet as a backup, but I will most likely be getting a ledger nano soon. Strange question: How do we know the company selling the device isn’t just taking a log of all our wallets, and eventually stealing millions worth of BTC?

You are right on that. I ended up using the economy transaction since it was only around 67 bits for the transaction.

I have breadwallet. How’s the security on it? I want to transfer over to that at some point.

Long term investing is better anyway. Historically you’re almost guaranteed to make money.

To send $50 to another wallet cost me about $23 in fees. Needless to say I did not send my money to said wallet.

Sorry for your loss. I hope you can your family can find a way to get through this tough time. If you need anything, you can PM me.

I put 8% into my account. My growth has been at 17% for some time. It’s still much less than my crypto wallets have made. I also have an IRA I contribute to and I choose my own index funds for that.

You might not even be selling, because bitcoin would be the new currency.

Bought at $10k, went up to $11k, then decided to dip. Glad I have some bitcoin anyway. All I had to do was wait a few hours to buy lol.

I bought at 7313 about a week ago. Feelsgoodman

I hope it does make a bit of a dip soon but then jumps back up. I want to buy some more! It was nice seeing that portfolio jump though I’ll admit. Now we’re almost at $11k I’m one night.

I’m just going to keep buying bit by bit. Only have around $100 bought (at 7313!) so the value obviously went up. I’ll keep buying more until I can start using it for more transactions!

Exactly. My retirement accounts consist of fixed income bonds and stocks along with some index funds to mix it up, and some company stock as well. 20% annual ROI. At least until the bear market comes.

I own 0.0125. I wanted to put enough that I can afford to lose, but has a tiny bit of potential. I also do want to actually use it for purchasing things like it was intended to.

That’s the first thing I thought of too.
