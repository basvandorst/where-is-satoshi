It's not as straightforward with GreenAddress since they're multisig, but I think that's the way to go.

I don't think it's necessary to pay fees to change wallet providers.
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:14:54
I think I need a more explicit explanation of what you're trying to say.

So in theory, I could've also helped push the original transaction through by sending another transaction from the "change" address?
In my case I owned both the source and destination addresses of the original 0-fee transaction, but had this been for example a payment to a third party, I wouldn't have had the option to create the second transaction back to the original address. In that scenario, could I try to force a "child pays for parent" situation by generating another transaction from the change address?
I hope I'm making sense, I can clarify if I'm not.

Great, thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:36:14
This is really helpful, thanks!

But doesn't running a node increase electricity consumption?
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:40:00
True. That still doesn't answer my question though.
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:39:02
I see... so I guess running a node will require a lot less electricity than mining?
Does the electricity consumption of a miner depend on the hash rate?

How will Coinbase be able to offer separate wallets for bitcoin and 2x? (I’m assuming they’ll be separate).
If there’s no such thing as a 2x address, then how do I accomplish step 3? Where am I supposed to send my coins?
How can I tell what functions a wallet needs to be able to do this? Is there another reddit post that goes a bit deeper into this?
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:19:31
That's helpful, thanks!
Is step 2 necessary though? Also, I assume I'd have to have a 2x address for step 3, do I need to have a 2x-specific wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:52:23
Yes, you just re-worded my question
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:07:03
"redditor for 0 days"...
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:40:45
Explain more?

Hodling* ;)
But yeah, I agree, I'm into bitcoin more for the value store and as payment and less for the trading, so hodling long makes 100% more sense for me.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:56:41
That sounds more like something I can understand, thanks :)
Is there a source I can go to to check out these charts myself?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:00:40
You have too many posts from Twitter for somebody that claims they don't use twitter...

What do you mean by "support" for 2.2k, and what's the evidence that there's "a lot" of it?
Why is 1.8k the next likely "step"? What's special about the 2.2k threshold that if it's broken, the logical conclusion is that it'll fall to 1.8k?
See, there *is* some more explanation you can do.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:57:47
What's TA?
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:09:49
Thanks! I have one more question, if you don't mind. You say "look at fin levels and order book walls too". Are these "book walls" a term I can find in coinigy or one of these sites?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:04:24
I can sense the passive-aggressiveness in this reply, but it does provide the answers I was looking for. Thanks!
