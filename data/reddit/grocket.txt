Compare [GDAX]( to [Kraken]( over the last 5ish hours. Something fucky was going on at GDAX.

[I would avoid coinbase](
Use your own wallet (eg electrum) and an exchange (eg gemini).
Unless you wire the money, it will take a few days to get the money to the exchange to actually trade.

I used coinbase in the beginning. I prefer to use my own wallet and a couple different exchanges. Coinbase has terrible customer service and all too often things go wrong.

and kraken and almost all the other exchanges ...

[No]( It's a good first exchange for someone in the US to dip their toes in. I don't know what would be best for someone wanting to get started with EUR.

If all you want is bitcoin, I agree with that gemini is great, especially if you're just getting started. If you're interested in more than bitcoin or ethereum, you'll have to get on other exchanges. I use gemini, kraken, and binance right now.

I am computer literate, linux literate even, and I still use Coinbase, because I'm a mix of lazy and busy.

Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if it's your own blood.

If you doing bitcoins as an investment, you should become familiar with [dollar cost averaging]( Then just keep track of your break even price.

I have a mint set of R2D2 coins. I'm set for life.

Yeah. I hear ya. I was able to pull my original USD investment out a while ago. Now I want to gradually increase my BTC holdings without putting any/much more USD in. I read [these projections]( and any increase in BTC could deliver a huge windfall. I'm willing to gamble a little in the volatility to get that increase - especially since my original USD is out of play.

I moved out of coinbase to my own wallet, then used gemini for exchange.

The people who time their shorts right will cash in.

I don't remember when it was, but the USD for BTC was about $0.25 when I first heard about it. I thought about getting $100 worth, just as a hedge. But it wasn't really an urgent thing and I forgot. That happened again around $0.50 and $1.00. After that I just sort of noticed headlines, but figured if I hadn't already, I wasn't likely to bother with it. Then it crossed $1000 and I was kicking myself hard. I started dollar cost averaging as it got under $750.

Jesus, you can go a whole 5 minutes without checking?

I would be surprised to hear the general public likes his terrible ideas, but this particular subreddit is just about in his wheelhouse.

dollar cost average. don't use coinbase. super simple stuff.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:50:24
I remember first reading about it when it was about 25 cents. Thought to myself, yeah, sure, I'll buy 100 dollars worth as a hedge. Promptly forgot to do that. Next thing I know it's over 1000 dollars.

my account got locked a while back - so i couldn't buy or sell bitcoin. i could transfer them in/out, but not convert to/from usd. it's been locked for more than 5 months. i looked online and found a lot of other people with similar experiences. the front end is really nice, but i suspect they don't have enough support and backend people. with the ongoing ATH i want to sell just a little bit to get some cash for other things, but i can't do that with coinbase. i've recently set up my own wallet on my computer and set up an account on gemini for trading. while there's risk with either approach, i'm more comfortable with the non-coinbase approach i'm taking now. but you and others may feel differently. caveat emptor.
