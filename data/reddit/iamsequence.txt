any form of new technology will be used for good and bad during its development... this is nothing new... you can make anything sound horrible by pointing only the bad parts... 
these points are valid yes, but worthless if you do not recognize the good points and how beneficial crypto and blockchain can be for the people. and also these comments are stated as if the USD isn't corrupted, but the USD is the cause for most wars we have seen in our lifetime... its as corrupt as it gets.

Hmmmm, no I haven't heard, what happened?

Well I can tell you that in November of 2000, Iraq stopped trading oil in USD and started using the EURO, and I think you know what happened years to come, you can also look at any other country who tried to break away from the USD and see how the states and the federal reserve reacted to them.  I could elaborate, find sources, match dates, etc etc, but to be honest, when I got off work I went ahead and checked out your history and you just seem like someone who is looking to argue about things. You picked out one line from what I said and completely disregarded everything else, even after I agreed to you. so you are more than welcome to respond and tell me that I don't know how the world works or whatever but I have better things to do, I hope you have a wonderful day!

no it is not a complete antidote to war and human suffering and you are right, all of those other currencies are all the same, but at the moment they are all centralized and controlled by central banks, and the central banks are currently funding war on every side... 
The idea of Bitcoin and Decentralization is to get away from a center point of power so no one entity has so much leverage and control. so no it is not an antidote, and nothing is going to fix our problems in a short amount of time... but it is definitely a step in the right direction so long it stays decentralized.

Hmmm tbh I didn't catch that, I'll have to rewatch that part. But regardless the way he is talkinf with such a smug look on his face bugs me. He seems like even if he was representing someone else, he looks more than happy to say what he's saying

oh geez! well i'm going to keep my eye on the news for anything regarding Brad Sherman. Things keep getting more and more interesting.

I would really like to know who paid Congressman Brad Sherman to spew such bullshit. most likely his investors and the banks... but still... 
fuck this guy.

I wonder who is paying Congressman Brad Sherman though?
