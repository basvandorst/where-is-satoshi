I feel we have become aware of the limitations of data throughput and bandwidth thus leaving us with limited blocksize which hurts the use case of treating it like cash.  This coupled with companies not upgrading to tx batching segwit and other upgrades, as well as price volatility leaves us with a strained main chain that becomes slightly expensive for small transactions during peak times.
The technological breakthroughs to solve this problem are still being developed.  Main net LN is still risky as there isn't a reliable way to recover lost funds.  margheritafav is looking for a solution but nothing is really ready yet 
Right now optimizations seem to be the focus in LN like AMP.  What sucks is I don't know enough to contribute, but the people working on LN are working hard.
There's still a lot that needs to be done for bitcoin to have all the features and function smoothly.  This bull blinded us of these issues and the bear makes them seem worse then they really are.

By mining bcash in the "hash war" Roger and jihan are losing 500k a day compared to of they were just mining bitcoin, and Craig and Calvin are losing 500k a day as well
I did a little math on my phone and I'm seeing jihan/Craig losing 880k-electricity and Craig 660k-electricity or maybe somewhere it between 
Either way they're wasting about a million a day combine fighting over bcash when they could be just mining bitcoin

He says "with no meaning beyond mining bitcoins and making its blockchain harder to attack." and then says "You’ve learned the only thing about blockchains that matters: they’re boring, inefficient, and wasteful, but, if well designed, they’re practically impossible to tamper with."
So on one hand he is criticizing PoW and on the other is saying it is what makes blockchain valuable.  
 PoW is the best system we have right now.  Small node requirements are insurance against rich and powerful users abusing the system.

- What do you think of Blockstream?
I think all the drama around blockstream isn't fair.  Last year 95% of miners and services signaled S2X after a closed door meeting where they came to the "New York Agreement".
So S2X fails and these same miners and businesses blame blockstream?  They're just slapping the users in the face and creating drama because they couldn't bully them into following their plan.  Also at the end of the day nothing changed so how is that considered some type of disproportional influence or control? 
What I'm constantly interested in is what will happen as block rewards halve.  Maybe 10 or 14 years from now what will continue the incentives for miners.  I figure the 2nd layers will preform their functions and consolidate 1000s of transactions into 1 with a higher fee then what we're used to.  I also wonder how much merged mining in 2nd layer protocols will play a factor into securing bitcoin.  If the block reward is only .78 BTC in 14 years I wonder how much will come from transaction fees and how much will come from merged mining.  I hope that in 10-14 years we have enough use cases, users, and applications to create incentive for miners to secure the chain all around the globe.

As if 6k+ bitcoin is a bad thing haha, wish I would have taken bitcoin more seriously in highschool (damn you satoshidice)

The rates are based off your collateral (BTC, ETH, etc.) bitcoin gives the best rate.  Then they give different options on loan to value ratio.  So the lowest LTV on 10k is 5.57 BTC at 50% and they offer the 11.25% rate.  If you get their 20% LTV on 10k and put up like 13 BTC as collateral the rate would be 4.5%. 
It's less of a risk for them to have a lower LTV so they can offer a lower rate 
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:41:53
when did he say this?  
because we saw a major test of PoW a little over a year ago and the rich didn't win.  S2X had 95% of miner and service provider support and it was abandoned because the community and many developers didn't want it.  
I wonder how a PoS change with 95% would work.  I would assume you couldn't stop it because PoS coins require a lot of resources to stake and a lot to maintain a node.  
Bitcoin's biggest attribute is the small blocksize because it gives the community power to reject centralized changes.  If a change was forced the small node requirement would allow a majority consensus protocol to survive.

Propaganda officially became legal to use domestically on Americans in 2012 when Obama repealed the smith mundt act 
but your right it was probably being used illegally since the creation of of the printing press 
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:01:05
the miners abused the EDA change and basically printed 100k+ bcash tokens outside the distribution consensus with a tiny fraction of the PoW, with several periods of 8 hours and no blocks found.  This not only made bcash unusable at the beginning, it made it a total scam with the 6 figure amount of addition tokens printed outside consensus.  
this is why bcash has a higher block height than bitcoin with only 18% of the PoW much of which was there before the fork (the PoW was 50% 50% on the fork date)

That's an interesting thought satoshi had
A post I read earlier today was that gold inflation percentage fluctuates based on its profitability to mine.  
Satoshi's 2nd observation, "In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around."  I see it as a shift from what you're talking about to what gold is in some ways.
Since bitcoin's inflation percentage is set, and eventually the profitability dictates the security of the network.  I believe we need adoption and price increases as we experience halvings and settle into the 21m coin maximum.  In 10-14 years I expect transaction fees to surpass block rewards.  This is needed to maintain a high level of security and eventually complete the cycle of a secure network and monetary supply without inflation.  I believe some sidechains and other projects will implement merge mining to keep everything secure while earning additional rewards for the same SHA-256 hashing.  
Another thing is these 2nd layers need adoption and efficient ways to load and unload their channels.  LN won't be widely adopted until watch towers, AMP (Atomic Multi-Path Payments), and channel factories.  Then I think some sort of service or autonomization process needs to take advantage of these efficiencies and group and consolidate channel loads and unloads. 
Bitcoin has a very exciting future and as bill gates says, “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” so lets keep working and develop something great.

Stephan Livera did a great podcast with the CEO of BlockFi Zac Prince.  He explains the advantages of getting a bitcoin backed loan such as not triggering a tax event by selling as well as writing off the interest on the loan.  They're a very interesting company in bitcoin.

This isn't about bitcoin, but  I found that bitcoin could be the solution to many of the problems outlined in this article. 
This one of their worries, "Criminals or nation-states could also change data, like financial information on balance sheets or commands going into an industrial machine, instead of merely stealing it or deleting it."

There's an interesting conference called consensus invest scheduled for next Tuesday the 27th 
Kelly Loffler, Dan Morehead (CEO of Pantera capital), Jan van Eck (CEO and president of van eck who's working on that big ETF), and many more.

it goes through a process of introducing a BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal) and that's discussed and if good it's developed and tested extensively
Then depending on the upgrade it's either a softfork (backwards compatible with current versions) or a hardfork (a split to a new chain) 
then it's up to the miners to signal the upgrade, and once a certain threshold is met the upgrade goes into a countdown so everyone understands what is about to happen
This is all assuming the upgrade has consensus.  If there's an unpopular upgrade being forced through or forked away this causes a split.  In the instance of S2X it became like a game of chicken with the miners and service providers signaling against most users and developers.  This prompted the UASF and almost caused a split in the chain.  The miners and NYA signers eventually backed down and we remained on the current consensus while the 1% of people who continued with S2X found out it had a fatal bug on the first block after the fork.  
This is my understanding of how it works, but I'm sure someone else here has a better understanding than me and please correct anything I have wrong.

I logged in to tell ya I've been following this, it's interesting.
I've read a quote from a Chinese miner saying they're shorting to lock in profits and continue mining.  This new instrument in the market could be the selling pressure keeping the market down with how commercialized and competitive and high stakes mining has become.
In my opinion this is good long term, idiots like bitmain can't be pulling the shit they did last year ever again.  Also it negates the false idea bitcoin mining is wasting entire cities worth of power. They're really trimming the fat and only the most efficient and smart miners will survive.  Imo it's all signs of the market maturing.

I'm in it for the tech but this past year carried a wave of emotions.  Almost none of the people who got interested last December are still around.  I joined the party early, but with this recent pump and dump I saw a large amount of purchasing power appear and then disappear so that stings.
I feel like this project will take another decade or maybe more to really show its worth.  Everyday I read Venezuela's trading volume going up I get excited, but bitcoin just isn't mainstream or user friendly yet.  I'm sure there are plenty of other better investments but bitcoin will always be special to me because of what it represents.  I like to think about politics, monetary policy, taxes, and economics and bitcoin is so alien I want to always own some and see what new concepts come from it.  
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:36:33
yeah I suppose anything can happen.  I misheard the first time and that 2nd listen clarified it more that it isn't official yet.
An interesting interview I heard on Stephan Livera's podcast mentioned liquid and how their inter exchange transfers pretty much ends big arbitrage opportunities.  With many exchanges enabling liquid we have defined price among the market across all the major exchanges.  I think this helps bitcoin mature and will give these new trading instruments (ETFs, Bakkt, etc.) a better chance of regulatory approval. 
But I mean it's all speculation who knows what will happen.  These won't make or break bitcoin either way.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:47:29
Yeah I agree with all the points you've made.  
I've been thinking about a standard bitcoin businesses should follow where they prove they have the funds for all their customers.  I don't know how it would work exactly, but if a standard was established certain bitcoin businesses could earn a rating beyond random reviews and reddit complaints. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:10:50
yeah that's what I remembered.  I guess it isn't official yet like I assumed but it is looking very good. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:01:03
Just a heads up, at consensus invest the NYSE and ICE owner Jeff Sprecher said they already have regulatory approval for bakkt

Blockfis business model is giving loans and using your bitcoin as collateral so it doesn't trigger a tax event while being able to write off interest on the loan 
It's a cool idea for bitcoin if someone was interested in it, although somewhat risky if the price falls and you get liquidated

Great podcast Olaoluwa, I'll have to listen to it again to get more out of it.
I have a question about the network scale-ability, you said something like the nodes don't have to all be on the same page which is why some LN explorers show different numbers in node count, capacity, and channels.  Would there be an eventual rating system for routeing node operaters or does your node ping possible routes?  I know it's still early and I'm probably missing a lot of the concepts, but if anyone can explain this more that'd be awesome.
Also I heard you mention a LN chess game.  Does anyone know where I can check that out?

If something can be hacked and placed on a centralized chain it really wasn't meant for bitcoin anyways.  The properties of bitcoin create a space where only certain things can thrive only under those conditions, one of those being money.  A product or process that works better while centralized isn't really meant to be tied to a decentralized chain because that removes efficiency. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:35:05
The network has a limit on how much data can be processed per block.  This is to ensure that the network's properties remain intact.  The network needs to have low node requirements to remain healthy.  It's an engineering thing, and it also incentivizes how data is written onto the global ledger.
This is where you're correct about coinbase.  They're a major exchange and didn't bother to use transaction batching or segwit for many months after they were implemented.  So they intentionally used the system inefficiently while passing the fees onto their customers and talking shit on bitcoin while promoting alts with worse characteristics. 
The fee for tansactions is based off the size of the transaction  (byte size not dollar amount) divided by the total amount of satoshi in the fee. 
that's a chart of the current fee per byte mempool.  So 6 hours ago 1sat/byte was getting processed, but now 8 sat/byte.  So like 1 or 2 cents 6 hours ago to maybe 18-25 cents now.  This limit is so crap like cryptokitties doesn't clog the main chain and everyone can remain on the same page so there isn't forks.  It's all about efficiency of written data and decentralization of nodes.  Small requirements ensures thousands of people can easily keep a record of the blockchain and verify it.

Bitcoin miners have several factors they have to take into consideration to maintain profitability.  They're getting a good deal on electricity.  This is from excess power produced by the power plant, or a renewable energy sources.  
The carbon footprint argument isn't valid, no miners are burning coal or gas or anything that's inefficient.  The author is arguing the average carbon footprint per watt and applying it to the watts bitcoin uses based on an antminer S9.  Those miners are being phased out as we speak so his calculations are dated as well as flat out wrong. 
The author conveniently starts promoting altcoins as a solution so I stopped reading there.  I've read this argument like 25 times and every time they promote a "solution" that isn't really a solution at all due to misunderstanding/misrepresenting bitcoin's characteristics.

Interesting chart, the last time we've seen the difficulty period take this long was near the end of the drop from $31 to $2 
The other blip above trend line was halving day in late November of 2012
Tthe trend under the red in 2013 into 2014 was the introduction of ASICs 
This chart really shows an anomaly currently happening.  The price decrease is obvious, and I think that is compounded with a futures market for miners to short sell and bitmain failing
