When the market rebounds Alts may gain more over BTC. But yes, crytpo is highly intercorrelated and anybody who says otherwise is a fool.

I like the Chicago school of thought. Everything in excess is bad. This country was built on debt and financing. Properly managed, a little bit of leverage is a good thing. Is it getting out of hand at a national debt level? Possibly.

Hypothetically GDP could increase and they could pay it off. Just like responsible people pay mortgages, credit cards, or auto loans in real life. Debt isn’t as evil as it sounds. But yes they could and will likely print more money. The issue itself isn’t debt, it’s the fact that politicians have short term incentives, commensurate with their time in office.
And bitcoin may currently be in disinflation but eventually it will be deflationary.

I’m sorry but this post is just plain foolish. Inflation is calculated by measuring CPI which is taken as the average price of a basket of goods. Inflation at 2% is not alarming and actually healthy for the economy. If you knew anything about economics you would have mentioned rising levels of sovereign debt as something to worry about or maybe even stagnant wage growth. Plus, I hate to burst your (crytpo) bubble, but having a deflationary currency (i.e. bitcoin) is equally problematic as it disincentives spending and consumption.

Buying GBTC would be easier to do and you could hold it inside of your Roth. But like others have mentioned, GBTC can be even riskier than owning bitcoin outright, given the large premium (fluctuates between 30-70%). Also, buying such a risky investment in a tax sheltered account is not recommended. Some reasons for this are obvious, but a lot of people overlook the fact that if you lose money within a tax sheltered account you can’t carry forward capital losses on your tax return. If you lose money in your traditional brokerage account you can carry forward up to 3k per year.

Market cap is different from AUM (assets under management). There’s plenty of institutional money managers that have a couple of trillion under management. Those guys are very unlikely to touch bitcoin though. Unless your Fidelity! Fidelity actually mines it. See? Not everyone on “Wall Street” is out to kill BTC.

I can guarantee you that Buffet has ZERO crytpo exposure. Mentioning him in the same sentence as Jordan Belfort is downright insulting. Buffet made his billions by investing in America. He bought the railways, textile plans, food processing companies, insurance, etc. He likes real, tangible assets with good value and strong cash flow. He never even invested in tech companies (which he admits was a mistake but in his defense he is humble enough to admit that tech wasn’t a field he knew too much about or had a significant edge in). Read about him dude and you might learn seething about one of the best. He may be old and missing the point on crytpo but he’s a damn smart man and there is no need to bash on him.
P.S. Buffet also escaped the subprime mortgage crisis largely unscathed in 2008. He claimed he didn’t like or understand the market too well, and managed to avoid the catastrophic losses that many of his peers incurred. He ended up putting his own capital down to save a few ailing banks and made a killing once the banks rebounded. He is a baller.

The point I was making is that OP is buying BTC instead of putting money in a savings account. The value of the BTC could hypothetically go to zero whereas his cash in a savings account most definitely will not. He should compare his bitcoin's performance versus his actual investing accounts and not the yield (inexistent) he gets from his savings account. But yes I agree that the liquidity of BTC is high.

What's the downside of multiple cryptocurrencies? Like everything else, competition will encourage developers to build the best possible platform. Investors and speculators will do the rest. It's seemingly naive to think one single currency will have a monopoly on the market. In my mind, there's some foolishness attached to some ICO valuations, but ETH makes sense to me at the current level and is likely to keep appreciating.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:42:47
This is not an apples to apples comparison. You are better off comparing your bitcoin performance versus your brokerage account investments or your 401k (which obviously still makes a resounding point in favor of BTC). However, Bitcoin is not yet a good cash replacement. Cash at the end of the day is a safer, more liquid asset.

I think as we see more institutional money come into the space, the whole asset class will be propped up. We are already seeing this to some extent. Whereas a few people are focused on "picking winners", I think the majority of the bets right now are only focusing on the viability of the crypto space as a whole. Some of the smaller alt coins are so opaque IMO, regardless of their respective ledgers/white papers/mission statements. I agree that it feels very 2001esque, anybody with an idea can make it rain out of their parent's garage. But I think the  race to determine a clear winner is still out of sight.

That’s like asking why corporations don’t buy bitcoin. They would likely get a higher ROE than they would in their regular course of business. But corporations are not in the business of speculating or taking huge risk with shareholder equity. It goes against their mandate and hinders credibility.

My understanding is that the real premium is slightly lower given that the fund now also holds BCH (and some BTG also). Anyway, the real premium should be whatever it is now (historically 25-30%) minus 8% (value of BCH as a percentage of BTC). Is that accurate?

I’m a bit confused by your post. You can hypothetically still “sell” USDT at any of the other exchanges that have USDT pairings. If I own USDT and buy any other crypto that’s paired against it, I am selling USDT. Liquidity of USDT will not immediately dry up. The issue only arises at the moment someone tries to “redeem” USDT for fiat at the actual source. In this case, my gut is that exchanges are probably the largest holders of tether and stand to lose the most if tether as an organization has engaged in a fractional reserve system (meaning USDT tokens are not backed 1:1 against fiat). The retail investor should be able to dump their USDT in favor of crypto without major liquidity constraints. And I would advise every retail investor to do just that. Immediately!

I think it’s clear for most that any capital gains/losses realized from crypto trading (baring a few anarchical idiots) need to be reported to the IRS. I think where the line gets murky is from crypto to crypto trading. For quite some time many people thought a taxable event occurred only when you wanted to cash out of your crypto for fiat. Now we know this isn’t the case. But tracking your basis when you’re day trading across different coins, combined with round the clock markets and limited tax tools from exchanges, makes it a headache for tax reporting purposes. If anybody has any good tools or ideas on how to go about this that would be great.

Good read. I think its fair to say that the market as a whole is mispricing either future hashrate or future prices for B1X/B2X. I'll jump to the conclusion that B1X and B2X futures are correctly priced and future mining support for the 2X chain is bullshit. What evidence do I have? Market forces of supply and demand for futures are actually present and people have legitimate skin in the game. Miners flagging support for 2X is based on nothing more than an empty promise with aboslutely zero skin in the game prior to the fork.

True. But they effectively still turn down business when your wires are being rejected by them or your funds get frozen for no apparent reason. You can't trade if they don't process your fiat.

Interesting, thanks for the info! And I assume if each device has a passphrase then these need to match as well? I understand both devices use the same derivation path for BTC but would this work for all coins? How do you handle coins supported by one device but not the other?

But seriously, maybe just buy and hold? You'll never make a decent return actively trading with such a small balance. Fees will eat you alive. Use a GDAX limit order to buy and sell if you absolutely have to in order to avoid fees.

Securities laws were created in a very similar setting almost a century ago when honest citizens were getting scammed out of their hard earned money by individuals and corporations selling snake oil. As much as regulation is flawed in its present state, people forget it was created (at least initially) as a way of protecting investors. I am all for disruption and getting away from the investment bank/private equity/venture capital model (a form of gate keeping), but the lack of due diligence and transparency in the ICO space terrifies me. You have teenagers warning each other about "doing your own research before investing" when that process merely entails reading a white paper and checking to see if the ICO's website looks legit. That's as deep as the "due diligence" process goes.

I wasn't just talking about the banks. What about the insurers, automakers, and all the rest that were going belly up. Let them all fail was not a valid solution. Every time someone brings up Iceland or some other Nordic country I roll my eyes. It's easy to govern 200k people who are all related to each other. Plus, their financial institutions weren't as deeply intertwined with the global financial network.

You can’t just “hold” stocks or bonds like you can cash or crypto. You usually need a custodian to keep those for you (ie: a brokerage service, investment manager, etc). The reasons for this are vast. Having a custodian in many ways is very useful. There is always counter party risk associated with a custodian but most people are willing to accept this trade off.

This needs to be higher up. Not enough people know or realize that the US government profited handsomely from their stakes in banks, automakers, etc. that they absorbed during the bailout.

Any thoughts on holding BTC in a trezor vs. ledger nano pre 2X fork? I currently have and routinely use both. I understand trezor was slower to address the BTG fork and still hasn’t come out with official guidance.
