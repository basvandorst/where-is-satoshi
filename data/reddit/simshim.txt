For something that will be worth 1/10 of what he paid in 8 years, at that. Talk about shit investing.

I had a bank account at 16 with a debit card. Just saying... If you're in the states, it's possible.

Prepaid debit cards, my man

Offer labor in exchange for a bank account owned and managed by your parents. The labor you give results in XYZ dollars, to which that can be used to buy bitcoin online. 
I have a son and if he offered that as an idea I wouldn't turn it down. But he was like dad DAD PLEASE PLEASE!!! 
That would be a no, son.

Intelligence, in case you were wondering. It's intelligence

Well isn't that unfortunate. I suppose you could lobby your parents.

I wish it would happen already so I can buy more BTC.

To make you feel better, you'd only have 10k. In the world of life, you'd still be poor.

I literally said that.... 


BECAUSE OF FEES 


Do a transaction for $5 dollars and tell me how long it takes to confirm. It's like you're not reading my posts, you're just responding to want to be right. I never said there was direct permission. It's indirect through fee discrimination. That is STILL permission **based**. It's just **indirect**.

Funny thing about that. Precious metals have actual use. Sure, I can understand your straw comparison. But it's only relatable to precious metals because the number of BTC is at a set number. Somewhat like the % of earth that contains gold in relation to other metals is relatively low, hence the value. Let that be adjusted, even once, the whole thing comes crumbling down. And it's not outside of the realm of possibility.

Even then you still need permission from the third party. Transactions are done on an order of magnitude. The more BTC you buy or sell, the faster your transaction will be done. It's still a permission based system, even if you aren't directly asking for permission. You are thought how valuable your transaction is. 
Bitcoin is great, I have coin. But in reality, it's just like every other currency and most commodities. It has the same failings all currency does. Because currency in itself is valueless. 
It's only valuable because someone wants it. On that metric, you can turn grass into gold.

I am too, I probably have had ~.5 BTC this year alone. Bought most of it when it was ~1200 USD. But I spent almost all of it on LSD and weed. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:23:25
It's what btc is. If everyone were to sell their coin within ~1 month the market would plummet. It's just like any other currency, a big fucking scheme.
I say this as someone with BTC. I bought it in January when it was ~1200 per. It's just hilarious that it's 5k now, 9 months later.

It's going to fall again
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:33:07
Buy high is never a good idea, but what is high? Where does BTC stabilize? Does it? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:22:15
They were being sarcastic.

That's just not true. Have you ever traded BTC before? You literally need a third party for BTC to go from me to you. Sure it's 100% digital, but that exchange of coin is done through a physical PC. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:34:28


So it's exactly like every other currency and tradable commodity. 


To be fair to history and not to take anything away from BTC but that is said about literally every currency when it's "new". 
When mining became a corporate operation only beneficial to companies with millions to invest in mining farms, the idea that it's the "end all be all currency" died.

Is it a milestone if it's already been there?
