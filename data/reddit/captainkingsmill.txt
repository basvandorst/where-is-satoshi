Thankyou! 
I can see it now! 
The smallest 'note' I had in my wallet was 0.043 which has been sent to the network, 
£15 of that is going to my new paper wallet, ready to give as a gift
the rest - fees is being returned to my breadwallet once confirmed.
Thanks for that, it's my first transaction that wasn't just transferring from an exchange so despite the fact i knew I'd done it right, I was concerned I had somehow sent much more than i'd intended to another address (hacked basically).

Yeh, No.
A lot of the trading is done within a platform, where no actual 'bitcoin' are traded with each trade.
it's only when you 'cash out' to either a wallet or bank, than an actual transaction on the blockchain will occur.

Thanks :)
as a bit of a newcomer to actually spending my coins, I was a little concerned.
you and have cleared it up perfectly.

That would be possible I suppose. But I think, most of the people who have actually transfered to wallets are more long term holders than newer folk who are doing a bit of day trading. So they are much less likely to get spooked by a drop like this. 
Also, I managed to make an economy transfer In 2 hours the other day, (admittedly the network was a little quieter) so if someone really wanted to get their coins to an exchange and sell, they could have done it pretty quickly.

Cheeky nandos to celebrate, lads?
