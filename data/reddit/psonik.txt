I've just been informed that there's hardly a hashrate difference between a single 5850 and a single 6970. However, 4 cards is going to require more power, a motherboard to support 4 cards (not cheap), a larger case ( I believe), and run around $1500 for the rig (a quick guess).

Perhaps I could have said something along the lines of "on the fulfilment of a set of specific non-interlinked rules" to be more specific.
I'd imagine, though I don't actually know, they're using something very much like cracklib (perhaps even cracklib).
On another note, static minimum requirements would actually *decrease* the security of passwords against brute-forcing. If, for example, all passwords absolutely required at least two numbers and a special character (length requirement being dynamic, or a significantly long static number), and this requirement was known, billions of possibilities would be removed from the guessing pool.

**4$z might not qualify because of its lack of length, regardless of the diversity of character types.

Calm down, pal.
For ease. The HD is only $40 (an 80gb could be purchased for around $10), and a CD drive is going to be necessary for installing linux. Linuxcoin live CD isn't a very good idea for a number of good reasons (needs set up at every reboot, doesn't save data, isn't easily modifiable, etc).
Risers/custom-stand is an *okay* idea. But that's going to take time to get right, cost a bit in supplies, and leave expensive equipment exposed to the elements (like guests, cats, silly string, who knows).

*Hand the exchanger some bills.*
"I'd like €x.xx or $x.xx worth of BTC, please."
"That will buy you y amount of BTC after our fee, using an exchange rate of z."
"Please provide a qrcode of your address or a copy of the address you would like the coins sent to."
*Show them qrcode from my phone.*
*Phone beeps to confirm the transfer*
"Here's your receipt sir/maddam."
The bitcoins show as transfered in about 1 second. They will "confirm" in less than 10 minutes. But they're as good as confirmed once initially sent since the exchanger is reputable and provides a receipt.
tl;dr Yes, the transaction posts faster than a credit/debit card transaction does. It "confirms" in less than 10 minutes- something which takes days (up to 30 or 60 days for complete irreversibility) for a credit card.

Imposing taxation is impossible with Bitcoin?
Yeah right. And the queen of England is a reptilian shapeshifter from the planet Nibiru.
Imposing taxation with Bitcoin is as easy, if not easier, with Bitcoin than it is with cash. The government doesn't need to be able to take your Bitcoin to impose taxes, they just need to take you- to prison.
The vast majority want to pay their taxes. The inconsequential few who don't will still be forced to pay most of their taxes through their employer, land/home ownership, sales tax, etc.
Mass tax dodging through interstate purchases has been going on for a decade because websites haven't been forced to enforce sales tax (other than for CA, TX, NY). Are state governments hurting from that? Not one bit.
If the US Government began to see diminished revenue from virtual currency adoption they would simply raise taxes where they are easier to enforce. The US government isn't going to flinch over bitcoin adoption.

No, competition is healthy.
Bitcoin has already been showing signs of serious issues with scaling and mining centralization. The former will likely be taken care of. It is high priority for Gavin right now. But what if the latter turns out to be an unfixible problem for Bitcoin? Hear me out...
Fixing problems with the former may require drastically changing how Bitcoin mining works by moving it away from a Proof of Work system and towards a Proof of Stake system or something similar (like what PPCoin does).
That is simply too great a change. If Bitcoin made a change that huge, it would no longer be Bitcoin. It would be something else (ie. PPCoin).
Or maybe Bitcoin will solve this one problem in a way which doesn't fundimentally change what Bitcoin is. But what happens when some day a problem comes by that destroys bitcoin? If there is no healthy competition to take its place, people could lose faith in decentralized currencies as a whole- *then we'd all be back to square one.*
Consider alt-coins as inssurance for the idea of decentralized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is going to go big right now. Its momentum is probably unstoppable. But when there's a fork in the road and Bitcoin heads unstoppably in the wrong direction, there had better be an alt coin ready to take its place.

Too late already, really. It would take at least ~2 years to design, manufacture, and construct an ASIC device with more than 51% of *current* network power and cost millions of dollars.
But of course, by then the network likely be 50x more powerful.
tl;dr It would take a *huge*, impractical, chunk of change and a lot of dedication to overtake the Bitcoin network.
Edit: Also, the many-million dollar machine would be essentially useless for anything else. It also wouldn't be able to mine other crypto-currencies, Litecoin for example. If something terrible did happen to Bitcoin I think a lot of people would jump to another crypto-currency long before giving up on the idea as a whole.

BeatySees view of this is simply incorrect. The lead developer of the Bitcoin project (Gavin) says he wants to make the block size (and transaction size) *unlimited*. This will prevent transaction availability from becoming a commodity and will keep transaction fees low.
The block size limit is not "fundamentally important" in any way. That is just ridiculous to say. The block size limit was planned to be eventually increased from day one. It was only kept low at first to keep the blockchain from ballooning to unreasonable sizes before pruning was implemented. Satoshi's original whitepaper goes over this.

Who says the government needs to know how much you made to get some money out of you?
Do you own land? That's taxable regardless of income.
Own a house? Taxable regardless of income.
Rent? Taxable regardless of income. What's to stop the government from requiring leases to be registered and include the public address for payments?
Income as an employee of a publicly traded business? Taxable.
Income as an employee of a private business? Probably going to be reported properly by 99% of employers for 99.9% of employees.
Income from sale of a vehicle? Taxable because the government will be aware of the title changing hands and the value of the vehicle. If people fake the value on the title (more than they already do) the government will just tax the apraisal value, rather than sale value, like they already do for homes.
Purchase or sale of anything which has to be registered? Taxable.
Etc. Etc.
The US Government isn't going to flinch at Bitcoin. Their coffers aren't going to go wanting. If you can't think of ways they can tax Bitcoin users, you aren't thinking very creatively.
Sure, if you can live on the interweb and subsist on bytes of binary code and never travel or do business in meatspace, maybe you can get away without paying a lot in taxes.

Only people *with* some amount of satoshi (more than 0) can add transactions to it- and only for that amount, or some potion of it.


Revisions are not possible. There is no editing the ledger.


No, not at all.
Everyone who runs the software helps verify the validity of new blocks for no pay at all. Miners get paid for verifying the next batch of transactions and unlocking the next block.
One lucky miner out out the thousands upon thousands of miners gets the 25BTC "block reward" and all the voluntary transaction fees which were added to the reward by people making transactions since the last "block" was mined. A block is mined every 10 minutes, on average.
So about every 10 minutes one miner is rewarded 25BTC block reward and ~2BTC-5BTC in transaction fees.
Every 4 years the based block reward is halved. The number of transactions is expected to rise to keep mining profitable.
To increase regularity of pay out, at least 70% of miners are in shared "mining pools" which distribute a portion of the mined block reward to all miners in the pool based on how much work they performed towards discovering the key to unlock the next block.


No. Inflation will be roughly 11% this year, roughly 10% next year, then 9%, then 8%, then **4%** (block reward halving), 3.7%, 3.4%, 3.1%, **1.5%** (halving), 1.4%, 1.3%, 1.2%, **0.6%** (halving) **etc.**

No, only public addresses which have been used in a transaction are included in the blockchain (as part of the transaction).

There are 2^256 possible private bitcoin keys. For comparison, there are less than 2^80 atoms in the entire universe.

Yeah, no. There is no way that is going to happen. Businesses and employers are not going to dodge taxes on a mass scale just because they're using Bitcoin. Employees won't be able to because their employers will be reporting their taxes. Buyers won't be able to because businesses will be enforcing applicable sales/luxury/etc, taxes.
If there is any indication that society is headed in this direction, the US government will simply give more funding/power to the IRS and Dep of Treasury to stop such tax evasion. They could inspect interstate shipping, like they do international, and send sales tax bills to citizens like they frequently do in the EU. They will raise taxes where they are easier to get and lower taxes where they are harder to get. It's that simple.
There is no indication that the US Government is going to so much as flinch at Bitcoin adoption, even on a massive scale.


And that's just great. Hopefully that will weaken their ability to run the economy into the ground too. Thus helping the US Government retain world power. If they keep with the inflationary USD, we might see runaway inflation and governmental collapse. If the US Government gets involved in Bitcoin early like they did the Internet they might be able to benefit from it more than any other large country, thus ensuring their position as  for a few decades more.

If it's not in their jurisdiction, they lobby (read bully) foreign governments into making it their jurisdiction through treaties and trade agreements.
There are benefits to being the world economic leader. The US can say "Enforce our laws in your land or you can't trade with us."  That's essentially what they do.

P2Pool pays the most by far.
P2Pool pays 100% of the block reward and all fees earned on the block and pays out donations to the pool.
In most other pools the pool operator takes the transaction fees for themselves *and* charges a pool fee of 2-5%.
So in BTC-Guild the miners might split 24.5BTC per block (25-2%). With 2BTC in transaction fees and .5BTC as a pool fee going to the pool opperator.
But P2Pool minners would split 32BTC on the same block (25BTC block + 5BTC donations + 2 BTC transaction fees).

Lots of people on [LocalBitcoins]( charge less than 1% (depending on location, totally anonymous).

You're implying that socialism necessitates force and/or the government to have easy access to money. That's not even close to being true.
Anyway, the government can extract taxes from businesses, employers, international and interstate shipments, property taxes, etc. all just fine. Sure they can't force it out of your wallet. But they can force you to pay up or go to prison just fine. Bitcoin doesn't diminish the state's ability to enforce taxes one bit.

The entire life of each satoshi (100 billionth) of a bitcoin has to be traced back to its genesis every time it is moved- this is how Bitcoin prevents counterfeit and double-spending.
Because of this, full-clients (MultiBit, Armory, Bitcoin-Qt, etc.) have to download the entire block chain (~3GB) onto your hard drive before your bitcoins will even show up in the client. You also won't be able to send/receive any bitcoins until your client downloads all the latest blocks (~10mb/day since you last updated) each time you turn it on- which could take a long time.
That's just the way Bitcoin is made to work.
If you don't want to go through this every time you need to send/receive bitcoins, you can use a partial-client which uses a remotely stored block chain like Electrum or an online EWallet which uses a remotely stored block chain like Blockchain.info
Those are your choices. 
Most people these days use EWallets. But be careful to *only* use EWallets which encrypt your wallet on their servers *and* do not store your private keys. Blockchain.info does this.

The Tor Network itself doesn't even use servers (or clients), it uses nodes and super nodes* (aka exit nodes). It is not a Server/Client architecture at all. It's a decentralized network of nodes, similar to how Bitcoin nodes work.
*Super nodes are not used to access Hidden Services like Silk Road. They are only used when accessing ClearNet services.

You're going to pay taxes no matter what on home ownership, land ownership, assets, collectibles, registered goods like vehicles, on your utilities, as fees in the form of vehicle registration, etc. Even if you don't directly pay taxes, your existence causes more taxes to get paid by your use of utilities, vehicles, etc.
If, big if imo, the US Government sees any significant drop in tax revenue attributable to virtual currency they will simply tax more where it is more easily enforceable- tolls, utilities, registration, licenses, home ownership, etc. etc.
Get creative. Can you really not think of a few ways to tax people which can't be dodged with Bitcoin? Do you think a million government employees, not to mention corporate funded lobiest groups, are going to have a hard time thinking of some? Not a chance.
Here's one. What if the government required businesses to recieve payments using specific addresses or face huge fines? A digital business isn't going to be able to dodge that unless they're entirely on Tor or offshore. If they're offshore, they're already outside of US jurisdiction- so Bitcoin doesn't change anything.

That's where you're clearly wrong.
The hash rate has risen ~10 TH/s in the past month. The publicly owned collective mining company ASICMiner accounts for 5+ TH/s of that alone. This is public information. 
GPU/FPGA miner growth should easily account for another ~4TH/s of that. That would be in line with growth from 6 months ago, back when the value of a Bitcoin wasn't going up 20%/week (providing incentive for GPU miners). 
So that leaves only 1 TH/s. That's the equivalent of 16 BFL Singles and/or Avalon ASICs. So maybe each of them are testing 8 at a time? That's possible. But it's nothing compared to the 800 TH/s of power the two of them have supposedly manufactured by now.

Your second "bank" wallet should either be on a second more secure computer which doesn't normally connect to the internet or stored on an an encrypted external drive, preferably kept in a safe. It isn't meant to be running in your BitcoinQT client.
To make a second wallet, just rename your current wallet.dat. A new one will be made automatically- that is your second wallet. Now save the public address of that wallet then move the new wallet.dat to an external drive (or thumb drive) and make a [paper wallet]( backup of it to store in a safe. 
Then rename your original wallet file back to wallet.dat.
Having two wallets on one computer would defeat the purpose of making one wallet (the "bank" wallet) more secure.


This second tip is meant to protect your wallet.dat file from being copied by malware which gets access to your computer. This one is probably overkill really. 
I believe the idea is to change the name of wallet.dat while your bitcoin software is not running, then change the name back when you need to run it momentarily.
If you want wallet.dat to have a different name and still work with the Bitcoin client, you'd have to modify the client's source code and compile a custom client for yourself. I don't know anyone who has done this (that I know of). I don't think this is what the article meant.

No, it wouldn't.
The equation used to generate the required number (with proper number of leading zeros) to unlock the next block changes every time a new block is generated. Old data is useless.
Imagine an equation like [guess] x [correct number which unlocked last block] x [total number of blocks] = [answer which must have N leading zeros]
Keeping a database of which [guess] numbers didn't lead to trailing zeros is useless because the other two factors are going to change every 10 minutes.
p.s. The actual equation is much more complex than that- but I think this should get the point across.

108,000BTC are mined each month. At $20/BTC that's ~$2m. You would have to singlehandedly comprise 1/2000th (.05%) of the entire power of the mining network to make back $1000 in one month. At 1/10,000th of the total network power you could make your investment back in (at least) 5 months.
Nobody knows how many people in total have pre-ordered and will be ordering in the coming weeks/months.
$10,000,000 in ASIC orders would make a $1000 investment equal to about 1/10,000th of the total network- meaning it would take at least 5 months to pay itself off (assuming a constant price, which is probably a bad assumption).

Try kicking the tenant out if they stop paying rent. In most states they are presumed to be a legal resident if they can present mail that they received there. Depending on the state, they can squat for 30 to 90 days now without paying a dime. And since you don't have a lease agreement, you can't take them to court for anything now or in the future. If you did have a lease agreement you would just expose the fact that you owe a bunch of unpaid taxes, potentially triggering an audit and putting a red flag on your account at the IRS for the next 5 years.
This is just one of thousands of reasons that 99.99% of people will wilfully report certain taxable earnings.
The government could rely on land owner, home owner, and rental tax for all their tax revenue if they wanted to. But of course there are hundreds of other streams of income for the government which are bitcoin-proof 99+% of the time.

It's obviously you who doesn't understand how quantum computing works.
Polynomial time factorization, "O(log-N) space" as you called it, does not apply to SHA-2 in any way. The quantum algorithm you described, Shor's algorithm, only applies to very specific cryptosystems- most notably RSA.
I will say it again, **polynomial time factorization does not affect Bitcoin**.
As I said above, the only thing quantum computing can *theoretically* do to SHA-2 is halve the key space (making it 2^x/2 ).
So how does this effect potentially affect bitcoin mining?
First, bitcoin mining difficult works by weakening normal SHA-256 from 2^256 possibilities to search through down to 2^(x-y) where y is the number of 0 bits needed at the current difficulty to unlock the next block. 
For example, the difficulty may dictate that there are 2^100 possibilities to search through to find a hash which will unlock the next block.
Since a quantum computer can theoretically be made to halve the SHA-2 keyspace, it would only need to search through 2^100/2, or 2^50, possibilities to find a hash which unlocks the next block.
At first that seems significant. After all, 2^50 is a *LOT* smaller than 2^100. But it's not as serious as it seems. 
Why? Because quantum computers are *MUCH SLOWER* and *MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE*- and they always will be (at least for the foreseeable future). Demand for quantum computers necessary to bring down their expense and increase their circuit density simply doesn't exist. Even if it did, demand will never be so great that it will outpace the momentum and history that conventional circuits already have.
So even though a quantum computer would have a lot less keys to search through, it would search through them very slowly compared to a conventional integrated circuit and for a much *much* greater cost.
What is much more likely to affect bitcoin, and computing as a whole, in the near(er) future is [Biocomputing]( which has the potential to miniaturize conventional computing down to the molecular level. This process will likely be gradual. Even if biocomputing CPUs make a huge sudden speed leap over silicon CPUs in the near future, this leap will likely not affect bitcoin because general purpose CPUs simply can't compete with an ASIC- even if they went 1000x faster than today's CPUs.
Eventually bio-ASICs may eclipse current ASICs. But that process is very likely to be much more gradual than the GPU &gt; FPGA &gt; ASIC jump which we've seen in the past two years.

More centralization is actually bad for network integrity.

Bitcoins were worth about $2/BTC just 6 weeks before they were priced at $32.

The value of gold started from nothing. It was a yellow rock- a little heavier than the other rocks. There isn't a lot more plentiful and worthless than rocks. Gold only has value outside of its scarcity because we've found applications for it.
Unbreakable cryptography has value because we've found applications for it. Some forms of cryptography are not very liquid or easy to trade. Bitcoin hashes are very liquid and easy to trade- from that bitcoin finds its valuable application in facilitating trade.
Some day we may be able to make gold out of lesser elements with fusion. Or we could find an asteroid not far from Earth with more gold than we could ever hope to need. Gold would effectively become worthless at that point. It's (very low) value would be derived entirely from its few industrial uses.
How is Bitcoin any different? If a large amount of people switched to an alternative or if the stock was inflated enormously by the democratic process of installing alternative clients it would be the same effect as finding a gold asteroid or learning to make gold with fusion. Bitcoin's (then low) worth would be restricted to its very few remaining technical applications (of which it does have a handful).
So again, how are hash functions (or more specifically applied hashes in a blockchain) any different from globs of electromagnetic energy vibrating at a specific resonant frequency--ie. metals--and what makes Bitcoin different from Gold as far as the Mises Regression Theorem is concerned?

To answer your question directly: One single home computer of 10 years from now could theoretically process all the Bitcoin transactions for the world.
You need to understand that Bitcoin miners do *not* collectively validate transactions so much as they all individually repeat the same exact work. Any one of them could do (and already do, in a sense) all the work on their own.
The reason Bitcoin has lots of miners is to prevent a miner or group of miners from contesting the accepted ledger with an alternative ledger, not because it's difficult to validate transactions.
Coincidentally, the miners on the Bitcoin network comprise a distributed supercomputer more powerful than all other distributed computing projects combined. I've projected that the Bitcoin network should be in the top 10 list for fastest supercomputers, of any kind, before the end of this year.

But basically the casino gives the player a hash of the shuffled deck (before the game) which can be cross-checked with the deck after the game (to prove it is the real hash). The same can be done with virtual horse races, slot machines, mine sweeper, roulette, etc.

I'm sorry eleuthria, but that is factually *incorrect*.
At 50% network power, just 20% of your pool's power could be syphoned off for a sustained amount of time with *nobody* noticing. It would merely look like lower luck. That 20% would be 10% of the total network. 
Even 10% of the power is enough to occasionally successfully side-mine 7 blocks on an alt chain that nobody else knows about. After performing a large 6 confirmation transaction, releasing the longer side-mined chain into the wild would **instantly** orphan 6 previously confirmed blocks *with no prior warning of any kind*.

What are you saying?


A quantum ASIC is still an ASIC. 
Besides, quantum computing doesn't perform SHA-256 hashes any faster than conventional computing. It does effectively reduce the keyspace a lot- but that has no benefit for mining.
Quantum computers are, and always will be, more expensive than conventional computers for performing certain conventional computing functions (eg. SHA-2) as they are necessarily more complex. Considering conventional computing's huge head-start on miniaturization, there will not be a point in the next 50+ years where quantum computing will surpass conventional computing for performing non-quantum hash functions for the price.
And again, a quantum ASIC is still an ASIC.


That irrelevant. ASICs will be used regardless of future SHA vulnerabilities. No matter what hash functions are used for Bitcoin in the future, ASICs will continue to be produced for mining. Any IC designed specifically to do hash functions for Bitcoin *IS* an ASIC by definition.

No, it cannot. A Majority of the processing power on the network has to agree to both the validity of any newly minted bitcoins and any change in the Bitcoin protocol for the changes to be accepted.
