Didn't China just issued a law against non-electric cars? If I'm not mistaking it will be forbidden to use non-electric cars in China in few years.

Sure I do feel good. Hoodled exactly! 
If someone would predict the market, why the fuck would he share it? 
With this in mind, Technical-Analysis based on a line is just are ment to cause HYPE!,that's it!

Huh, the only connection to Firefox and Mozilla is the Gecko engine as far as I know...
And no they weren't closed, just got purchased and rebranded few times.
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:45:57
You know version conversation has improved since the 90's.
And anyway, It's just a number... Ten years after Netscape was released, browsers was quite a sensation.
So I don't really get your comparison, but whatever..
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:53:39
Source? Where did you came up with Netscape rebranded to Firefox? 
As far as I know it's not true, because it was purchased by AOL.. and then to other companies.

Most of us agree. ( I hope ) and hearing such statements from an important figure like Elon help to spread the word and increase adoption. ( Of course it's just a drop in the sea and actual developments will only make the difference, but what I'm trying to say is, there is no harm in such statments)
Edit: spelling

This is amazing. I'm asking questions, mine are way more reasonable then yours, and I'm the one that pushing agenda. ��. Go ahead look at my comments history. I truly don't give a dam.
But it seems that you can't get a straight answer to this question. Because it become an "argue" and "I'm pushing and agenda" before I can get answer. And that's exactly the reason I asked the question.
Just to be clear. That's a honest question. I truly don't give a dam about all this crypto fights.
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:23:10
Because no one use it yet. Hopefully it will be true in the near future
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:12:56
Dose that mean a node that connected to the internet 24/7? If so, then no ��.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:11:24
I wanna push nothing :0.
I'm subscribed to many crypto-currency channels. As I like to see the whole picture and gather my own pov.
This question/topic is widely used as propaganda, that's why I decided to asked the the question.
What is UTXO? I'm unfamiliar with that method.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:53:50
You are a programmer right?
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:31:25
Ha I didn't know that. Glad to learn new things!
How such thing can be achieved? What is the method name? ( I want to look into how).

How much will cost to transfer 1$ worth of btc?
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:31:25
Can you run node on your smartphone? Dose it cost the same (bandwith wise) to sync a node 24/7 (compared to email client?)?
I don't get your comparison. It's purely ignorance.
And again I push no agenda. I only confront your comment with the really facts (which you seem to ignore to push your idea)
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:32:04
Semi-anonymous my ass.
This is a clear heads up that privacy-coins or at least a way to shuffle your transactions with others is mandatory.
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:11:05
I hope it's mirrored, Otherwise It will be hard to read :0
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:47:04
What? No it's not.
It uses GSM protocol ( rather then TCP IP), so assuming you have only 2g network in your country or if a data package is too expensive for you, you'll be able to benefit from GSM access to the block chain.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:21:18
It's nice that scammers give us heads up :)
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:20:38
It dose not seem to bother people around here.

No they can't, this is sent to btc wallet with the bcc-wallet-address, which cannot exist, so the coins are lost.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:42:10
Wtf, no you can't.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:44:13
Compared to Traditional ways if trafficing money between countries, yeh it's instant and free.
Instany, - between 1min to 2h if you pay fair (0.09$~ today) fee, not 3 working days.
Free - you can transfer 100k$ with as little as 0.09$ as of today, not 1-5% of your transfer + fee.
So yeh, it's free and instant.
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:46:54
That's right, "instant" dose not exist, but the author assumed that you'll notice it's a figure of speech, and yes as figure of speech they often relative to something.
E.g "My new phone opens the app instantly" should be wrong as well....but it's not, since this is not physics or something, just plain old conversation.
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:51:16
Thanks for tr answer, but I'm not sure if you are right.
If I learned something frrom crypto ( which reflect to every system that require trust from humans) is that you need an insentive in order to insure usage/security.
In you answer, being "part of the network" is not collectively "rewarding". (Unlike mining for example)
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:29:12
(honest opinion/question, willing to learn :)
What's are the benefits of running lightning node?
From what I understand, it's pretty hard to setup and not rewarding.
