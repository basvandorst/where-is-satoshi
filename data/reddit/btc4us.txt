Thanks for your replies. I am no expert in networking or quantum computing, so I cannot say that I can refute what you have said.
Given that, I was mostly curious for discussions' sake what the difference would be in a truly distributed digital currency.

The idea behind the picture in this article is the basis of what I want to discuss here. When something is decentralized, graphically, we still see that there is some central issuing node from where the sub-nodes retrieve their data.
When I first invested in bitcoin, I initially thought that the role of each node was more along the lines of a distributed mesh. Of course, we see from this visual and from our understanding of bitcoin, that currently someone must make decisions regarding the release of information, and miners are like the sub-nodes which distribute to the masses of wallet holders, where confirmation is made. It seems to me that the originall idea implanted by the bitcoin pr videos suggest that things go peer to peer, but that isn't necessarily true, as they go up to the blockchain, and down through the miners.
The article is about governments, but the argument applies to currency. Is there a place for a truly distributed currency? How would something like that work?
Note: I am in favor of the miners, and I think everyone appreciates their role in securing the system (even though miners are really just in it for themselves [we know mining isn't a virtue, but it helps everyone]). I'm also a big fan of bitcoin and what has come out of it, in terms of technology, the discussion on the role and need of government in many ways, and turning my dimes to dollars.
