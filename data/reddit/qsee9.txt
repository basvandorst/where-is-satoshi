This is how you blow up your trading account (and end up in financial ruin)
Learn how to manage risk. Stop loss.

Regarding your last question, I disagree. Stability and growth depends on Bitcoin (the platform) being useful. That doesn't mean BTC has to be useful as a currency, and I sincerely doubt it ever will prove useful as a currency. 
My suggestion would be to think bigger. For instance: the Bitcoin blockchain, secured by the Bitcoin network, is probably the most immutable thing ever created by humankind. Ask yourself whether more and more people might find that immutibility to be a useful property, and might start building more and more things that depend on that property. Then what was merely useful becomes indispensable. Ask yourself how much BTC, given its scarcity, might be worth in that scenario.

I don't have any advice for you, but for anyone reading this who has BTC on Coinbase, please make sure that you have two-factor authentication enabled with an authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator), NOT SMS (look up "SIM card hack" if you're interested). Should take maybe 15 minutes to set up. Then, buy a hardware wallet and teach yourself how to use it.

That's...not how pricing works

Lotta people never bought to begin with. They saw it happen, they talked about it, but they didn't buy. Some of those people will buy this time around.

DCA is not the best strategy for maximizing return. For an asset with positive expected return, the best strategy is buy now, not average in on the way up (mathematically that should be obvious).
Bitcoin has high volatility, which means it may not go up in the short term. This fact does not render the above statement incorrect if your investment horizon is long term (say a year or more). But, esp. for volatile assets, DCA can be effective in minimizing regret, which can help control emotions and avoid selling a loss.
If you have conviction and know you won't sell if the price drops, buy now. Otherwise DCA. Probably won't make a huge difference in the long run.

Fair enough. Practically speaking most people are forced to DCA anyway, since most of us are not sitting on mounds of cash. The broader point is that once you have the cash, there's not much sense on waiting to invest it in an asset with a high positive expected return.

Dollar cost averaging is not the best strategy. The best strategy involves buying low and selling high. If you have $10000 to invest in Bitcoin, and you think Bitcoin is going to $1M, the best strategy is to buy $10000 worth now, not average in as it goes up.
Either you have conviction that the price will go up, or you don't. If you don't, don't buy. If you do, buy now. I'm not accounting for the daily fluctuations that traders seek to take advantage of, because this is focused on long term investment.
Edit: added second paragraph

Suffice to say credit won't cease to exist. The way I see it Bitcoin is more "anti-central bank" than "anti-bank" but if everyone becomes their own bank (custodian) then it's interesting to think about where the capital for loans would come from. I could see a movement towards P2P lending models, facilitated by second layers, and perhaps custodian models where the custodian acts more like a traditional bank. Not very knowledgeable here but that's my two cents.
