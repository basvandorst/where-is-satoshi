The alt account I was using at the time was supposed to be my Etch-a-Sketch account, on which I stopped posting etches because I broke my Etch-a-Sketch.
Sorry to say I've deleted all my bitcoin comments at the time, with the exception of the one post where the [tip occurred]( so I could go back and thank the user after I used it for whatever good thing I could come up with.

You're right, I'm getting prematurely disappointed. I'll add that onto my email and be patient I suppose.
Thanks for clearing my head up a little, abdada.

White listed? You can request that?
I'm happy with the unbelievable convenience of Coinbase, but maybe I'm spoiled by snapCard's super service.

Oh my hot damn pizza! $200??
I know [this pizza]( isn't worth $200 but I did what I could
I don't know what to say! Thanks so much! This has completely made my night.
Have any drawing requests?

Yes! It is hilarious how, in trying to move from USD to bitcoin, I have more trouble with banks than I do with securing and using my own wallet!

Oh darn I meant etch. But since you caught that I suppose I can attempt and fail at drawing for you!
I normally prefer the Etch-A-Sketch because I have no clue how to draw, but since anything is impressive on an Etch-A-Sketch that normally becomes irrelevant.

No, still have no bitcoin. I got my money back from the first transaction but the second transaction is in pending limbo. I made a third and fourth transaction with extra money I had and I'm waiting to see if those go through.
I don't even want my money back. I wish they would let the transaction through instead so I could have my bitcoin. Or at least send some kind of response.

I think the difference is that you're throwing around insults and threats and even trying to place the blame on them for your bank fees. Your bank made a mistake, not Coinbase. Same with me. I realize that my bank messed up and I called them and they waived the fee once they fixed it.
Continuously spitting venom isn't the most helpful thing.

I mean the biggest reason why I have problems with CB is actually because of my bank.
Coinbase finally responded, though. Basically used nice words to say too bad, this overenthusiastic security has to protect our asses so you'll have to just buy it again at $830 instead of $410 and take just under half the bitcoin you had planned for.
I have to admit that the sheer awesome experience of getting hit out of nowhere with the $200 equivalent bitcoin tip I value more than the extra bitcoin I would have had if my purchases had gone through properly and hadn't got the tip.

Specifically asking that so you can compare my drawing to my etch of them from last time someone made that request? 
I think I am [doing this wrong](
