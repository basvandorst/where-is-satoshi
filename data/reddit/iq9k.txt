If only binance has a separate site that accepted USD  to BTC. *sigh*
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:11:15
Buy bitcoin on coinbase.com, send over to binance.com buy trx with bitcoin simple as that mate 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:00:15
Nigga what 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:39:57
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:36:46
How about you send some BTC and I'll buy on your behalf? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:37:58
Saving is bad for the economy, that's the point
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:04:15
"Trickle down" economics is a real thing to a certain extent, buy your right in that it doesn't always cause the proper redistribution of wealth, at least not in the short term. What I said was an over simplification of what happens
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:27:53
So then your purchasing power would be the same, but while economic growth would be recessive.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:09:54
Kinda, but then you make less money as well.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:08:43
Well, I mean there is a specific economic model for everything I've explained in my previous comments, but we're on Reddit so what do you expect, I don't feel like laying it all out. It would probably require a week of lessons to fully understand the concepts
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:42:38


 
In a sense, yes. For physics, you can conduct experiments, edit and tweak little things and see immediate results. With economics, all you can go off of history. You cant just set up an experimental economy, and to test economic theories on a society to just to see the results would be unethical. Economic theory also has the power of math on its side, but like I said it takes years to see results.
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:23:34
There are very few examples, simply because naturally any economy is inflationary naturally, however the great depression is an example of a period of deflation
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:28:56


@_date: 2018-05-14 07:59:19
Well, that's how all currency works really. You also do realize that wages pace inflation at about the same rate right? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:19:15
Ur mom is devoid of skill
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:04:34
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:27:03
Well, in a way inflation can act as a tax
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:43:08
I think you're the one that's got things backwards. 
Let's pretend that there is only 10,000,000 dollars on circulation. How would things appreciate and increase in dollar amount if there is only a set amount of dollars? What would happen when population increases? Would people just get a smaller cut of the 10 million? Inflation is essential to growth.
@_date: 2018-05-14 23:06:46
Thing is though, wages typically don't go down, employment does.
And I get what you're saying, but have fun convincing everyone that downward trending wages are a good thing.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:09:21
Deflation is bad though
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:11:01
Very crude indeed haha
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:51:26
I can't name a single company that I have worked at that has given me a wage "cut", even in recessions. In the 1920's economists believed that wages adjust just like prices do, but the fact is they don't. When the great depression hit, people didn't get wage cuts, people just got fired, over 25% of people did in fact.
When the value of the dollar goes up, and wages stay the same, companies are paying their workers more in a sense, and after a while these companies will just start letting these people go. It's basic economic theory that deflation causes a decrease price level, but also a decrease in employment level as well.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:05:09
I didn't say hyperinflation, I just said inflation. Hyperinflation is almost just as bad as deflation.
And yes, you literally do need inflation for things that are "always appreciating", otherwise you would essentially increasing the values of assets out of thin air. Remember the housing market crash? The dollar deflated during that time. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:31:07
Currency is a unit of account... so instead of using a unit measurement, you're going of the amount of the good? That is complete ass backwards


We literally do have this system today. When you take out a loan, you don't pay back with inflation it delflation adjusted, you just pay back the numerical amount. When there is inflation, the borrower will pay back the numerical amount at the expense of the lender, and if there is deflation, the borrower will pay back at the expense of themselves.
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:41:50
No one is robbing anyone... in order for your house to appreciate like you expect it too, inflation is a key component to that.
Would you rather have the buying power of your savings account with $7k to stay the same or have the value of your house or go up $50k.
Hell, even the increase price of bitcoin wouldn't be possible without inflation of Fiat. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:57:43
In a sense, they do have a magic lever to control how much you want to buy. The more money and wealth you have the more likely you are to buy more stuff. A decrease in interest rates cause an increase in investment for and from businesses, which gives you a fatter pay check and means you spend a little more on groceries and other goods. Maybe you'll try some fillet Mignon instead of your regular new York strip eh? Or maybe you'll finally get the new Apple ipad instead of opting for the cheaper smaller Samsung tablet. Who knows.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:10:14
Well sure, hyperinflation is terrible, but so is deflation. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:58:16
Either wage would constantly be going down or employment would
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:07:09
I'm not the original guy lol but I'll answer.
Deflation is kind of like the middle step of the entire thing. Stock market crash and other things created deflation, and then the deflation created the atomically high unemployment rate. It is basic economic theory that deflation cause a drop in price level (cool, stuff is cheaper!) But also cause a drop in employment level (my money is worth more but now I have no job!)
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:08:46
Why is the fact that there is a finite amount a good thing?
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:31:03
I don't think you have an understanding of currency
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:53:59
If you're gonna brag then you better share some of those returns boi
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:01:50
Sorry, when I said money I meant both physical currency and checkable deposits, or credit as you would call it
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:49:26
Bitcoin is a good store of value, but not as a currency.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:35:21
Most people's idea of implementation would bring the price lower, which a lot of people would rather not see.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:54:51
There would have been an economic meltdown in 2008 without the fed
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:36:24
Bitcoin? As a currency? Heh
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:46:21
If banks didn't exist, where would you get a loan to start a business or buy a house? They are a necessary middleman
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:44:06
Can you explain to me otherwise then? If bitcoin was successful and universally adopted as a currency (which would be never), then the price have to go down.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:58:47
Thing is though, these private banks are heavily regulated at this point, they all have to follow the same rules and requirements that the fed sets
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:44:08
Not really. The more people spend the better the economy does lol. Surely they would have taught you this in **your** marcro econ class yes? Or did you over sleep that lecture
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:57:50
Think of it in two extremes. If **everybody** stopped spending money and just put it under their mattresses, the economy would freeze and there would be a collapse. If everyone spent every single dollar they had today there would be an insane growth in the economy.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:29:53
It's stupid if you want it to progress as a currency, yes.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:01:45
Inflation theory wasn't developed but there was still inflation going on, inflation that was poorly monitored and unregulated. It was a contributing factor as to why there was a great depression...
As I mentioned in a different comment, how did emperors and kings expand cities and fight wars? By mining more gold, which is essentially the same thing as inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:35:58
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:53:45
by mining more gold, which is the same thing as inflation
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:00:24
uh huh
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:49:50
Well I'm a scrub that knows very little about micro and macroeconomics, but from what I know, there are 4 different factors of growth; Labor, Land, Capital, and Technology.
Labor (population) has pretty much tapered off with most first world countries. Land we're pretty much running out of, but with Captial and Technology, there's plenty of room left for those sectors to grow. Somebody feel free to correct me though
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:10:47
lol alright buddy
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:35:36
Most banks (in the us) loan out quite conservatively. All banks have money on hand at any given moment, so they don't actually loan out "more than they have"
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:33:58
If there is no inflation there is no growth in production. This doesn't really matter for bitcoin but is very important for all societies that use real Fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:36:44
The the reserve requirement is 10%... most banks try to stay over that.
There are plenty of reasons to hate banks but this is not one of them.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:10:16
Ah, I think you should retake your econ class bud
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:47:11
Edgy bro
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:31:46
You've got it backwards. If bitcoin was more successful, then the price would be lower, not the other way around
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:37:09
Rapid unsustainable market growth which inevitably leads to a crash
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:48:02
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:39:13
Lol @ people thinking the coin hasn't moon'ed already. Even with the dip 6k for one fucking coin is a lot. 
Did people already forgot that 7k months ago was the new ATH?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:33:29
Works as advertised 
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:03:19
Can you give me an alternative then? If the Fed wasn't there then the banks would have no one to borrow from, and they would inevitably fail.
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:50:39
You're not shuffling money, you're creating wealth everytime you spend your money
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:06:08
Market share is shrinking by the minute and you want to talk about brand recognition? Sure, bitcoin is a household name, but so is Mariah Carey, but she aint exactly topping the charts like she used to.
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:28:07
As someone who has never had even a whole coin, that's alot
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:52:32
Think they might be talking about consumer computers.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:53:46
Bitcoin still ain't there yet
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:14:28
Binance is top tier
