"If you are a US-based customer, unfortunately your account will soon be demoted to level 1"
You do realize that even coin to coin trading, if dealing with Americans, still requires FinCEN Regulations to be followed (As well as Cali and Texas) ?
FinCEN considers Virtual and Cryto currencies both "Currencies" now..
EDIT: Any type of an exchange whether dealing in Fiat or anything that is considered "Currency" falls under an "Administrator" per their ruling..
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:30:45
Now your talking.. This is exactly what needs to happen. United there is no bigger force then "Us".. If the Bitcoin computing power is any example of how big "we" are, nothing could stand in our way. If the entire community or a large part stuck together, tackled each country one by one there is no way we would fail..

50,000 is all i would need to get the ball rolling, Once you build it, they will come.. 50,000 builds the foundation and enables you to get more investors..
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:59:30
With all due respect "(almost certainly much worse)", this is your opinion based on the people you know, the experiences you have had and the motivation or lack there of, you foresee that would be required. 
50,000$ is more then enough money to create a prototype and proof of concept to gather more investors, based on the things i know and the people i deal with. 
**As far as a start up - my first start up, all i had was 10,000, i had NO investors and made 1 million my first year.
I'm not here to argue or to prove you wrong or to prove me right. I know what i know based on what i have done in my life. From everything i have learned based on my experiences one thing sticks out more then anything: 
“Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."..

As far as merchants go  here is what Coinbase has to say: 
When you cash out from Bitcoin to USD with coinbase the amount of money that is quoted upon cash out, is what you will get, price fluctuations do not effect you. There is an option so any order you get, you can have sent directly to your bank account, meaning, there is no way price changes will ever effect you..

@_date: 2014-02-09 16:56:26
I'm not sure about "the moon" or w/e that truly means but i do believe Bitcoin is better then any other online form exchanging money.  
With that said, it matters not if one day Bitcoin is worth 1,000,000 or 100$. It will always be worth something. Its efficient, its "anonymous" (to an extent). Its better then credit cards. IT WORKS. 
So let the hoarders and speculators walk away, let all the non-believers who only care about profit walk away. 
If that were to happen, In the end when the dust settles Bitcoin will still be an effective secure way to make online transactions as well as a host of other things that can be ran atop the blockchain. It will always be worth something to people online and for that i am grateful for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:08:10

lolol, nice analogy..
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:41:09
agreed, im truly amazed to see even one downvot for this. 
Aside from "making money", by the spread of Bitcoin we also gain more nodes, more miners, more transaction that will in turn lend its self to those who are looking to profit in the way of monetary gains. Me peronsaly, i just want to see Bitcoin grow and bitcoins used everywhere. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:08:07
Does google sell its self ? Can you name anything that is or was born on the internet that has done better then Google ?
No, you cant, not even Bitcoin.. And Google pays for Advertising.. There is an old marketing quote "You know what happens when you don't advertise? Nothing."
Viral exposure can only take you so far b4 it starts to lose steam.  Coinbase and Bitpay got a nice ride for "free" its time to put up a few $s.. 
Oh, and also, lets not forget, they are American companies, Advertising budgets are tax write offs, they will get most of the money back they spend on advertising..
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:52:57
50k will get you proof of concept, a prototype to attract more serious investors. It is no doubt a gamble, but for that reason, 5% is fair and realistic.

There isn't "parole", that is correct, however, there is the second chance act (which he will eventually qualify for) and there is always the chance parole will be reinstated.

Dear MtGox Customers,

Well all i can say is i respect your opinion but il have to disagree with that assessment.. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:54:31
Actually, if I'm not mistaken there was violence in his case, so that disqualifies him for the second chance act. And realistically there is a chance of parole being brought back. There are a lot of reforms happening due to over population. For example, not even 4 years ago if one was caught with 50 grams of crack they were sentenced to 10 years mandatory minimum. Due to 1 gram of crack being equivalent to 50 grams of coke, in the eyes of the law. That law is gone (its 20 to 1 now). IF you want to learn more about these things, check out "FAMM" (Families Against Mandatory minimums). In the near future there is a big chance a lot of drug laws will be repealed/lessened; its already happening and they are being applied retroactively (in some cases).. "Violence" tho, that is the big thing that will hurt a lot of people.

@_date: 2015-08-13 22:58:48
Well, i have actually found a way around it.. I used a VPN and logged in with an out-of-state IP, loaded my account, re-connected using a New York IP (So the ad sticks) and it all worked.. I'm guessing you may have logged in using an out of state IP ?
EDIT: I actually created a new account using the out of state ip and loaded "credits" using Bitcoin..
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:05:11
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:16:22
Not only that but i thought all they had to do was submit the application, pay the 5k and wait for a response. I was under the impression whilst they wait they are allowed to operate as usual. Maybe this is a consorted effort to "Punish" New York for enacting such regulations ?
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:34:33
Well, actually they sent me a new address verification link. Now i have to upload new address verification documentation.
@_date: 2015-08-14 00:41:36

Then why when i make the same purchase for the same amount at practically the same time one hits instantly and one takes damn near 24 hours... Maybe it has something to do with the transfer fee ? Maybe Athena is trying to save btc/$ buy being cheap towards the miners ?

I wonder what the problem is.. Wonder if they lost their processor.

Thanks so much for responding :)
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:27:40
You don't get it though, it is there fault. I buy around 400 to 1k worth of BTC a day. I deal with libertyX mostly and pretty much all the local ATM's on a daily basis as well as Coinbase.  The ONLY time i have ever have these problems is with their ATM's.. 
And Believe me, i don't want it to be true, they are the closest ATM around and their fee isn't so bad. With that said  this is the 3rd time i have had this type of problem and it is always with Athena.
Look at the receipt, look at the time i deposited the cash and look at the time the transaction was actually broadcast-ed.. How can you blame that on the Bitcoin Network ?  These people are just not on the ball and i can almost bet  they sending each transaction for the lowest amount they can.. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:46:13
I run a website that resell's Bitcoin to people who need it in small amounts and im a BAD saver. lol, im working on it.. There was a point i was up to around 5k but like i said, i suck at saving $..
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:49:05
To be honest i do not believe they try to operate like this. Because most of the time it does work "fast". I can only assume there was some type of update they did not implement. The last 2 times i had a problem with that ATM it was due to a time out / system crash. 
The first time the machine crashed and spit back out my last $20.00 and did not get me a receipt and the time after that i got a receipt but the amount entered was wrong and has no transaction ID.. 
This time everything was worked "correctly", i got a receipt, the amount deposited was correct and the system did not crash.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:52:28
I'm sorry but i call bullshit... I do not doubt you tried to save or better yet failed to update your ATM to the standard transaction fee. 
The thing is there was no broadcast until over 7 hours after i loaded the money into the machine. You can clearly look at the receipt and match that up with the broadcast time on the blockchain.
Look at the other receipts from RocketCoin, they broadcast their transactions minutes after they got the money, which would leads me to believe the ATM/Athena had no bitcoin. Long confirmation times have nothing to do with the time it was broadcast..
I would love for someone at Athena to explain to me how a lower transmission fee would have anything to do with the time the transaction was broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
And please do not try to blame it on the internet. I have experienced your ATM timeouts there was nothing wrong with the inet at the time of that transaction. Everything worked fine.
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:07:23
hell no... I wish..  Athena is the cheapest ATM (around me) by far.
EDIT: Aside from that, that really has nothing to do with it. Athena could be the most expensive but that does not mean they are paying a higher transfer rate to the miners when they send transactions.

@_date: 2013-12-29 00:11:35
The problem with Bitmit and pretty much all other sites that accept Bitcoin is they rely on people who already use Bitcoin. Everyone is trying to cannibalize the already established community. People need to branch out, introduce Bitcoin to new people in new markets. 
Also, Most people who run Bitcoin sites have NO MARKETING Skills whats-so-ever, its sad but its true. Give Bitcoin some time, wait till the real online marketers take notice, you will see things change. However, as long as people go around hanging a "Bitcoin sign" on their window and wait for people to poor in, nothing is going to happen.

@_date: 2013-12-29 20:03:02
thats Great. Its good to take out ads but what would be even better is if you hosted CoinURL ads on your site. 
This way, more people who see your site learn about coinURL, maybe these ppl will become publishers as well as advertisers. Either way, its a win win for all of us..  
The more people who advertise on CoinURL, the more the clicks will be worth, equaling more BTC in your pocket as well as everyone else who publishes for CoinURL

I vote this down, only because what your saying maybe "facts" but even with "facts" you can still read between the lines. Seems to me like you are using what your read / heard in a negative manner.
Its clear to me Financial institutions in China can not do business using Bitcoin, this is based on a sensible reason, the Chinese Gov does not want to leave its  Financial institutions unprotected from a Bitcoin crash. On the other hand, I do not take from anything i have read that people in China can not TRADE bitcoin for w.e they want. 
From what i have read,  products cant not be priced using Bitcoin, meaning, you can not PRICE PRODUCTS in Bitcoin alone.  If a product costs (hypothetically) 10 yen, and a Bitcoin is worth 5 Yen. Bitcoin has now been "PRICED" in Yen as is the product that is listed. One is not selling their products for Bitcoin nor is that product priced in Bitcoin, Its priced in yen, in my opinion..
I do not see China saying "NO" to Bitcoin, i see China saying "we are not going to support Bitcoin by giving it an official status of a "currency"".  Im not a Chinese lawyer nor do i know ANYTHING about Chinese law. BUT im willing to bet there is a HUGE difference between the word "Sell" and "Trade/Barter". I'm willing to bet any Chinese Citizen has the right or ability to "trade" or "barter" any product that is not labeled illegal. Bitcoin, last time i checked, had not be made illegal by the Chinese Gov..

This is irreverent, you don't trick a bunch of people into coming to your site, based on the fact that you are only charging 2.5% then out of nowhere increase by DOUBLE. 
Your comparison to amazon and what they charge.. 
How much Traffic does Amazon have ? how many products does Amazon Host ? When was the last time you saw a TV commercial for Coingig ?  Coingig is NOT amazon, they are NOT Ebay, there is no excuse to charge that much money. 
If coingig wants to start a charity because their business plan did not work, thats fine. But dont just DOUBLE prices and call it "we need to expand" 
If i didn't know any better i would think Coingig believes they have a monopoly and people have no choice but to pay at this point..

Who do you report that to ? Who is going to calculate how much the BTC is worth the time you got it ? I dont know if anyone actually watched C-Span, but this exact situation was brought up.
The example used was the selling of "pies" Bitcoin is NOT a currency its an object. If you ever sell that "Object" the amount of USD you actual get is what you report.

And you think Ebay, if they did accept Bitcoin, would charge people less then people who use USD ? i doubt that, Even if Ebay does accept Bitcoin, thay would have to drop their Fee's or there is still room for Bitmit or anything that would give lower prices then Ebay.. I personally think Bitmit has a whole lot of room for growth even with Ebay accepting Bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:50:59
I feel that Coingig screwed over their entire community. They charge 5% now, thats more then PayPal and Ebay. Why use bitcoin and pay more and be able to buy less, when you can just use USD, get w/e you want and pay less.. I think Coingigs 5% fee is hurting the ENTIRE community.
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:18:54


Actually YES, i do think it might accomplish that. If enough ppl upvote it. Of-course it will.. lol
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:51:48
I Stand corrected, Coingig is cheaper then Ebay + Amazon HOWEVER, i still think its wrong to double prices. That is a drastic increase. If you need money to expand or build bigger, i think you might want to consider making a public offering OR host a fund raiser. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:33:01

Coingig is does not eve have 1% the products Ebay does, yet charges 50% of what they do.. I STILL say they screwed their customers..

Sorry buddy, i cant agree with that, Bitcoin is not Taxed, USD is taxed, you to not pay any gains for anything until you sell it. Bitcoin is UNREGULATED. USD "gains" is what we pay tax on.

THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT, TO NOT DEAL WITH places like Ebay. You think if there was any real competition to Ebay thay could get away with that ? 
This is the same reason Coingig is doing it, they are comfortable NOONE can steal their customer base no matter how much they exploit them..

Do you have an idea of how much they want to sell ?

There was an Ebay with out a PayPal.. They just made a nice match, i still believe they could both stand on their own feet.

I would like to hear the outcome of this. Good find..

Well, i hear you on that, but if you look at their Alexa rating just by optimizing for Anti paypal keywords they are close to breaking the 100k mark. Think it might be a good idea to optimize for those keywords to get the exposure to Bitcoin, rather then a paypal wanna be.

can they adjust how much they have to pay for products or shipping or how much it cost to cash out to their currency.. fear not.

There are already a few directories, although i do agree "is ask organisations if they accept Bitcoin. " i try to ask at least one new company a day.

I did create my own site and maybe one day i will "take the market".. I don't know what country your from but where i come from we are allowed to express what the fuck we want. You can call it complaining i call it expression.

im sorry to say but you are wrong. People who rely on PayPal are not to tech savvy, they have no idea what they are missing because most are scared of what they don't understand. 
Take browsers for example, how long did it take the rest of the world of windows users to figure out, you do not need IE, Once they realized this FF killed IE and opened the door for Chrome..
