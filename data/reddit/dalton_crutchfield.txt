Depositing usd into gdax through bank transfer (2 to 5 days) is feeless, and through card is 1 to 2% I believe (don't remember exact amount), but is much quicker. Technically, if you trust Coinbase/gdax to hold your private keys, they are safe for any amount of money. They have safety precautions in place and are trusted by many individuals. That being said, personally I trust myself to keep private keys safe, rather than a large corporation. Also, me storing them non electronically is much less of a target than a large company holding countless keys in a database. Another thing that lead me to a hard wallet was forks. I knew that if I had my keys then I would get all pieces, where it is up to Coinbase what happens. All in all, Coinbase has measures in place, and in all likelihood should be safe for any amount of money, but I trust myself more personally. Hope this helps!

This is a great explanation. Thank you!

Yeah...Coinbase sucks m8. Very much out for profit rather than what's best for their users

Since they are partners it is quick and feeless to transfer between the 2. Also, your Coinbase account login will work for Gdax once you connect it. It will be the same timing as Coinbase (2 to 5 days for bank transfer)  since it is the same process. Transferring from gdax to other wallets (for example a ledger) takes around an hour.

Coinbase is where I started, and it has treated me well overall. After a few months on Coinbase, I was tired of such high fees so I started purchasing from gdax, who is partnered with Coinbase, so it is feeless and quick to transfer between. I then moved to a Ledger Nano since I trusted myself to keep private keys safe more than a large corporation. It was also around the time of Forks, so I knew that no matter what Coinbase did, if I had the private keys, I would have all pieces. Hope this helps!

I gave a paper wallet for a secret Santa gift. I trusted that the recipient (in a tech/consulting field) was responsible and understood security (we work with databases all day) that he would not do something stupid

That should explain things better than I can

The price is higher due to fees. The difference between what you pay and the current value is the fee they are charging for profit
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:15:03
I believe just the transaction fee. 
Side note, but personally I try to avoid using specific dollar amounts. By using the price at the time of post, combined with the fees, one could determine the exact amount you deposited. And so on...
Not an issue in this case, just a good rule of thumb :)

Luckily my Mom has a good grasp on investing and will intelligently explain things, and hopefully eventually buy in. Thanks though!

What are everyone's thoughts on futures? I have heard a lot of pessimism, but my original thought when I heard about it was that it was great and one step closer to mass adoption

Today's all time high is tomorrow's dip. Waiting for dips isn't necessarily worth it if it is only dipping to where it was 2 days ago. Bitcoin, and crypto as a whole, still has tons of potential, and will likely increase greatly in upcoming months and years, especially with Futures coming soon. If crypto truly is the future than these ATHs are still nothing compared to where we will go
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:13:24
Today's ATH is next week's big dip. Never be ashamed at buying in at an ATH and hodling. BTC welcomes all

More information than you probably wanted, but this is all possible fees

Not completely sure of the comments you are reffering to, but in my experience gdax is great. You can fairly instainly get usd into your account via card transaction with fees or wait 2-4 business days to get it feeless from a connected bank account. Also, gdax is connected with coinbase so it is instant and feeless to transfer between the two. You can buy or sell at market price or set your own limit price, and the graphs and data shown give a lot more information than coinbase. When I send to my ledger from gdax it is not instantaneous, but goes through in an hour or so. Overall, I have had a good experience, and it scales well on android as well. Hope this helps!
