Just because you can't find the answer doesn't mean there is none.

Well keep getting gang raped by banks if you like it.

If you are interested in a floor on price, instead of 1 gold get 0.9 bitcoin and 0.1 iron, makes a lot more sense, at least you are picking the medium of exchange that has the best properties as a medium of exchange, and you do not inflate the price of gold's "real" applications.

Convenience for storing and transferring value has actual economical value.

The difference between losing 100% and 99% is 1% of a fraction of an amount you normally could afford to lose, in other words, it's nothing.
Volatility isn't an intrinsic property. As a store of value bitcoin has way better properties than gold, the fact that it currently isn't used as much as gold for that purpose only means it has more potential to go up in value.
My point being, why wouldn't you buy something "worth its price" + a good SOV/MOE, rather than some half-assed hybrid that neither has that much intrinsic value, nor can compete with crypto as a value standard (again, think intrinsic properties).

Gold's value is more speculative than that of iron (among a zillion other things) and its properties as a value standard are no match for crypto = gold sucks, an iron/bitcoin alloy is better.

If you want to be prepared for a future where electricity goes permanently out, you store food and guns, not gold or bitcoin.

Yes, you can hold it in your hand, that's why it is much harder than bitcoin to store and transfer. So pick what you think is more important for a medium of exchange, ease of storage/transfer, or nice texture and color.
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:55:03
No, but how is that relevant for a medium of exchange/store of value?
@_date: 2019-11-11 09:59:15
More importantly, it's way easier to transfer/store than gold.

This is about as correct as claiming US bank notes have no value because anyone can print small pieces of paper featuring a face and a number.
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:47:53
Losing 99% of its value isn't all that different from losing 100%, so what about picking the one that has better properties as a medium of exchange, and stop inflating the price of the one that can be put at better use? Besides, if you are interested in something that has intrinsic value, why would you even buy gold rather than iron?

If you invest $10k in something that crashes, how is it "hugely different" if you are left with $100 or $0 ?

So what, euros have value, but printing them doesn't make USD less valuable.
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:40:03
This has absolutely nothing to do with sunk cost fallacy.

"Algorithms can be easily reverse engineered"
"it's almost impossible to hide a wallet when your caught unexpected"
Easily done with brainwallets, you just have to know what you are doing.

He doesn't understand entropy.
To create entropy for a brainwallet, he starts with a random page of a random book, performs convoluted shit with that page in order to... be redirected to another random page of another random book.
I couldn't stop laughing.
