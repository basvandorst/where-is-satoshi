You want to make "a few thousand dollars profit" off a 200 dollar investment? Ok, buy now and come back in a few years. Even a dip to 10k wouldn't make a difference to your end goal in the slightest with such a small investment. BTC would have to reach over 100k per coin to realize your dreams. You'd make more money with a part time weekend job.

You said "A few thousand dollars profit is honestly what I'm working towards id be so happy if I got that" Do you not remember? It's only a few posts up. What i said still stands, whether you buy now at 14k or later at 13k, or even later at 10k (which is not likely) it will make very little difference when you are trying to make a 1000% profit. When BTC reaches 100k, you'll be there either way.

Ah, I see. Yeah, Bitcoin futures brings uncertainty to our market, that is for sure. The only thing certain is uncertainty. There's many schools of thought, even one that says Bitcoin is being setup for a major crash so Wallstreet can cash in on shorting BTC by announcing a quantum computer that can crack its encryption. No one really knows what will happen. In the end, you just have to go with your gut. Personally speaking, there are very few chances like this in life and sometime you just have to take a chance. One thousand bucks really won't change your life if just kept in the bank.  And your life really won't be changed if you lost it. But maybe. Just maybe. That 1000 invested in BTC could change everything... I'd say invest. Ultimately, you have nothing to lose.

Dude, you said it is what you are WORKING towards, not just some dream you'd be happy making. Come on, be real here. And everyone knows about the futures trading. And? That has no bearing on your level of investment. If you're this scared over losing a hundred bucks, stay out of crypto, you'll have a heart attack.
