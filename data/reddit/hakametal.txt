You guys are absolutley brain-washed. Cognitive dissonance comes to mind.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:38:49
That's exactly the essence of what Bitcoin Cash is doing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:42:01
You're dillusional. There's no such thing as spam attacks, it's supposed to be a peer-to-peer currency. If your network can't handle transactions, then Bitcoin is as good as usless.
Stop being brainwashed and educate yourself.

May the best coin win ;)
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:21:03
But thats just it. Lightning still requires a user to send transactions to a lightning hub from the main chain. The issue still exsists.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:42:46
Actually it's called free market competition.
@_date: 2018-09-20 07:59:33
The irony here is astounding.
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:31:39
I agree, you don't buy coffee with gold. You buy it with cash. That's why Satoshi called it "peer-to-peer electronic cash". But that idea is long dead here it appears.

MDMA is one hell of a drug...
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:14:34
Lesson: BTC transaction times and prices are the reason we are even in this mess.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:16:59
I can't even withdraw now, anyone know what's up with that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:42:17
Free market capitalism baby. No commies allowed.

The DAA on BCH was triggered an hour ago.

If miners go to S2X, Core and user are gonna stay with the 1Mb chain, becasue they're too proud to accept the miner consensus.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:00:09
Irishman checking in. I use Kraken becasue of the SEPA transfers. Kraken in general is better suited to €.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:05:01
So basically you're arguing that you don't like competition?
Look, the free market will decide. It's not an attack, it's simply competition.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:15:32
Pride and arrogance.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:07:51
Dude, the entire network is clogged with literally hundreds of thousands of unconfirmed transactions.
With a fee like $0.36 you'll be waiting at least a few days. The average fee right now is ~$13.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:42:37
You've also got to take into account that if S2X fails, miners could fall back on BCH as a plan B.
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:49:42
This is great, let's trust the government!!
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:09:21
I genuinely believe that this entire civil war comes down to two **primal** beliefs (fears).
Deep down, NO2X want bitcoin to ultimately be a store of value. Deep down, PRO2X want bitcoin to be used as an actual currency.

I need to read Atlas Shrugged again...
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:48:30
The **supply and demand** for space on the blockchain. Right now, the demand is high, but the supply (i.e. space) is not matching the continuoulsy growing demand (i.e. why transaction fees are getting higher).
I'm not taking side in this, but there is a lot of truth to what people like Ver says.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:33:19
Come on man...
The average person was never meant to run a full node and you can be damn sure the average joe won't be able/want to either. Miners have always been the backbone of blockchain, why should that change?
If you believe that everyone should be able to use bitcoin, then running expensive nodes by bigger entities was always the plan from day one.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:41:43
And watch how governments will try and tax the life out of corporations and businesses for accepting it. It is only a matter of time before governments try to outlaw the usage of bitcoin. That's not being a pessimist, that's being pragmatic.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:04:50
In my opinion, what Ver is saying is that bitcoin has become a club for a limited few who deep down want bitcoin to ultimately become gold 2.0 and not an actual currency to be used by ordinary people. That's why he's a proponent for BCH and the SegWit2X HF.

1. Comparing emotional investment to certain polical ideologies is of no use to this conversation.
2. He never said paying for blockspace was wrong per se, but limiting the opportunity for anyone to access that blockspace was. Which is the whole argument right now. If anything, limiting the blockspace so users have to pay incentives to actually use the network, which is essentially dictated by a select few miners is the closest thing to centralization... and we have that now.

Becasue a [fork]( is an actual term in software engineering.
Splits only happen if developers disagree with the newer version (the fork) and decide to continue on the current version.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:20:15
If this is the case, then doesn't that mean BitCoin's future is of a store of value... and not a currency?
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:42:27
I use dollar cost averaging, not because it's effective but because it gives me peace of mind. If you wanna try and time the market, you are a trader not an investor.
My bitcoin plan is 10 years minimum, with a bit invested in a few altcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:31:20
I genuinely wasn't trying to be. He didn' know the difference and it is an important difference. My intention was not to be a dick.
Regardless, my point is still valid: **A fork does not inherently mean a split** (The BCH fork is proof of that).
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:45:21
Anyone who profits from mining is obviously gonna be anti-2x. But that's the whole point. Decentralization is about free market capitalism. If you don't believe in that, then you don't believe in the foundation principle of BitCoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:44:22
Depends what your goal is. Do you want to buy a new MacBook or do you want to own a house?
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:10:26
You don't know that. For all we know the price could plummet.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:49:28
Fairy dust.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:59:20
Sobering times ahead...
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:42:55
2nd best is after S2X.
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:08:33
He's joking. But seriously, start adapting a dollar cost averaging strategy when investing in BitCoin. It's too volatile to predict pullbacks.
If the 2x hardfork actually goes ahead in November though, prices could fall. Again, keyword *could*.

That "economist" is Milton Friedman, who is arguably the most important free-market advocate and economic scientist in American history.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:13:08
I gotta be honest here. 67 cent to send a transaction is already insane and is why the SegWit2X folks want this change.
If you actually think a mining fee of 67 cent to send a transation is OK, then you are fundamentally against the principles of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:43:18
You'd be surprised...
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:37:55
If that is actually what you believe, then your vision of Bitcoin is doomed as a currency. A Bitcoin user is not "free" if he has to consistently pay for his freedom. That is ridiculous and you damn well know it.
It doesn't matter how advanced the technology is... if laymen won't use it becasue it's too expensive, then Bitcoin has failed and is no better than traditional banking.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:37:46
Here's what I think:
The Great Recession pt.II is around the corner, my estimate is ~5 years. It's going to be far more brutal than 2008. The price of bitcoin is going to go down with the dollar and gold, not as badly but it will go down. When the recession ends, we will enter into another period of decent prosperity (aka another bubble) and bitcoin will then be worth far more than it is right now.
But make no mistake. Bitcoin will go down with the dollar and gold... but will recover stronger because of it's limited supply.
EDIT: grammar
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:51:18
There are more and more people that believe BitCoin's destiny won't be a currency, but a store of value. It will become too valuable to be used as money. This argument is essiantially why BitCoin Cash was created.
Note: 
@_date: 2019-09-02 07:07:02
You're being pedantic. Regardless, Satoshi clearly defined Bitcoin as an electronic cash system that was peer-to-peer. Bitcoin is becoming less and less that.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:44:20
A fork does not inherently mean a split. Educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:50:45
Very poor mindset. You have ~$2750 worth of value. What's you're plan? Where do you see your investment in 10 years? What are your goals?
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:43:26
Billionaire actually. ~$6.5 billion
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:11:41
Sorry for being a noob, but is 2x definitely going ahead?
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:07:13
? I literally just said that.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:44:24
Sounds like you want BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:57:21
How much in miner fees? Just curious.
