What is it even trying to say? Going to the Bank is optional. I can do everything with online banking, or pay for basically everything with a creditcard

Also a healthy back is probably more valuable

bitcoin is a horrible saving account. It is not secure and way to violent. Inflation is not necessary a bad thing and is something that for example the ecb does on purpose to strengthen the economy

i personally just dont see how anyone can see bitcoin (atleast in the current form) as any kind of save investment. I personally see it as a fun, but very risky investment.
if i had worked hard for the last 10 years to halfway afford a house, then bitcoin would be the last thing i want. My work could be gone in a few days from a crash, hack, scam, anything. Accidently sitting down on my hardware wallet and breaking it sounds awful. Or it just malfunctioning. And dont get me started with cloud wallets. With a bank account i just dont see it happening. i dont see any draw back to fiat money and the banking system honestly and much prefer the safety it provides for my money.

could i have some of those advantages that would make those outcomes good? what does crypto have for the average person (not the neighborhood drug dealer), that fiat does not?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:18:45
fiat is shit for storing value? then how good are cryptos compared to fiat?

id rather say fake and stupid, but also a bit horrible
oops, i meant to say, that it is nice, that op's 6 year old daughter wants to invest in bitcoin. good to see young people believing in the blockchain and hoping to cut out those mean banks from the middle.

i honestly have no idea, what people are talking about when they are talking about bank fees. I have never had a bank where the bank took a fee for anything, except a loan. I get the opposite, interest (even though it is almost 0 atm).
