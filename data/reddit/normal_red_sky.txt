As I pointed out to some people they probably don't know how fiat currency works either, they don't need to be able to use it.
I'm not a mechanic but I can drive my car because I only need a subset of knowledge to be able to do so.

Thanks for posting these updates, always good to hear from someone who's actually there. Obvious question but do you think anyone will take notice of the missing 5 zeros as the prices for everything is so astronomical anyway?
I know a lot of people are crossing into neighbouring countries to buy good, what do the people who can't do that do?

Try to avoid some of the mistakes that guy made. The very first question was what's the point of them? He started off by comparing it to the Internet (good idea), then started talking about how it'd enable decentralizing domain name registration. I guarantee that if you even mention shit like that to a non technical person not only will they instantly switch off and glaze over but they'll think that it's too complicated and technical for them to understand and stop listening.
You should point out that it's good for businesses as it means they don't have to go through middlemen in the form of card issuers and payment processors who each take a cut of the transaction cost every time they take a card payment. They also have minimal outlay as they don't need expensive POS terminals and card readers which staff will need training on as it can all be done on a smartphone and they get the payment directly.

When banks send batches of payments between themselves they are encrypted and also signed with a RSA key pair. This consists of public and private components. You already manage private keys in a secure way along with every other UK bank.

It sounds like you need to educate yourself on the basics of how Bitcoin works first.

I wouldn't start with that! Why would you sit through 10 hours of lectures about something you think has no value?

Can you guarantee you'll keep up the payments on that safety deposit box for the rest of your life? Even if you can a fireproof document safe with a high insurance value rating in your home will probably be cheaper long term.

Murphy's law is something everyone should think about. I'd suggest putting instructions in a will that can be followed with minimal technical knowledge. Don't point them to a location on your PC with a lot of instructions for how to use a client you may have switched away from by the time they need to access it. I'd probably put the recovery words in the will with instructions to put them into a client and a recommendation to just sell them if they don't know what to do with them.

It's good but too long, it lost me half way through and I understand it. I wouldn't show this to my parents who are just trying to understand 'but what's a Bitcoin?' 'Who runs it?'

This approach means they can attract a larger customer base while reducing risks to themselves and keeping accounts and taxes simple. I personally wish more merchants would take this first step. More widespread adoption will help it become the currency it was meant to be. Who knows, if that happens maybe the next big rise in value will be from something more sustainable than another hype cycle.
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:37:59
The will would be handled by solicitors who will be quite used to handling sensitive information like bank and pension details so I wouldn't be too worried about that aspect, especially if you designate a trusted person to handle it when the time comes.


Again, I'd caution against making it too complex for non technical people otherwise they might just look at the block of Base-64 data and go 'what's all this computer jibberish?' and decide it's too much hassle to bother with. Besides, where do you store the key to decrypt the seed, how do you secure that?

The Ferrari would have deprecated drastically, then there's insurance and running costs. Bitcoin would at least have retained its value and hopefully increased.

This will never happen, it's far more likely each country will create a crypto for their own currency which they'll still control, look at the Petro.

Are there any that integrate with SagePay? If they can't do it through that, most companies in the UK at least, won't have a clue.

No a bad idea, I wouldn't mind one if it could be done. Some jewellers do laser engraving of names or initials on rings, maybe if you got a large signet ring they could do a custom job?

It was clever technically but I don't think Satoshi foresaw the influence of big traders. Part of the reason the price is so volatile is because there are so relatively few BTC in circulation.

So they avoid mentioning Bitcoin in the transaction details and don't move a lot of money, like everyone else.

Great to see real world adoption. What are the confirmation times like? Having a customer stand around for 10 mins waiting for a transaction to go through isn't practical for most shops and this has been a major barrier so far.
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:20:01
I don't think each shop running a full node with all the complexity and upload bandwidth required is realistic. It's a lot of kit and additional expense you need in addition to your existing POS.
What's needed is an established provider like Square who can also take conventional payment methods to start taking BTC which they've made steps towards already.

Just checked out your site and the products look amazing, keep it up. Hope more places do this, for Bitcoin or any other crypto to be a currency, people need to use it as one, not just trade it speculatively.

SHA2 is a hashing algorithm, not an encryption algorithm, it can't be reversed. There's an important difference, you can't decrypt a hash.

I think this is less of a problem than it's generally made out to be. How many people understand how the current monetary system works? They might think they do but they probably have in mind a process decades out of date where all money is created on physical presses.
You don't need to know how a car works to drive it. If requiring drivers also be mechanics were a prerequisite to owning a car, very few people would have a car.

I've had this problem with the same generation they can't understand how there isn't some company or centralised entity behind it. it helps if you're already familiar with the concept of free software, which most aren't.

It doesn't matter how clever AI gets it'd still have to crunch a ridiculous amount of cycles to compromise Bitcoin. The only thing that may come close would be quantum computers which are still in a primitive stage of development.

You first need  to use an exchange like [ to buy Bitcoins.
Then you use a wallet app on your phone or computer.
Withdraw the Bitcoin you purchased to the receive address the wallet app gives you.
Find somewhere that accepts Bitcoin.
When you get to the checkout they'll ask for the amount in Bitcoin equivalent to the price at the time.
Send that amount to the wallet address they give you.

This is sensible advice and stops people losing their shirts and just speculating on random things when they don't understand the business or what may affect the price.
What would also be a good idea is trying to understand what's behind the hype when $nextBigThing comes along. If more people took the effort to understand why Bitcoin is such a big deal I think we'd have more buy in and adoption.

Bitcoin was partially created as a response to quantitative easing by the government. The government can effectively print money because they control the supply. In Bitcoin no one person or entity does so it's not susceptible to political whims.
The limited number of Bitcoins and the way in which they're mined (created) creates a steady supply which helps combat [inflation]( If you could make as many Bitcoins as you wanted they'd be worthless because everyone would be making tons.

OK, I'll bite


Better how? Other crypto currencies may have specific technical capabilities Bitcoin doesn't or at least doesn't have yet but they've not got the user or development base or brand recognition. Nor do they have the proven track record Bitcoin does. Like it or not Bitcoin is the gold standard all other crypto currencies are measured against for good reason.

Imagine you're going on holiday to a country called Bitcoin land where they don't take dollars. You have to convert your dollars to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin to dollar exchange rate will change all the time. The shop keepers in Bitcoin land know this and change their prices in line with the change.
