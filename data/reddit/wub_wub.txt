Few years ago I sent ~2.5k eur from Italy, it costed around 10 or 20 eur and I can't exactly remember how long it took to get to my bank account, but I know it was fast and less than a week - 3 days I think.  
Also transferring money from Germany, more recently, to Serbia and Bosnia was like 3 eur per transaction and was done entirely online
You can also send money via WU for 5eur per transaction, also can be done online and money is transfered within minutes.
It might not be considered "cheap" if you are sending really small amounts up to 50 eur, but let's be fair, 3-5 eur per transaction is overall pretty cheap. There are even options that cost like 1 eur and are done within 3-5 days.
There are some options that take ridiculous fees and take a long time, but you are not limited to those.
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:10:39
Yes, that or some sort of scam. Either way it's unrelated to the purchase.

Other than the subreddit name/topic could you please elaborate why I'm wrong? 
I'm not trolling or anything I'm genuinely interested why you think I'm wrong and how the outcome of the situation changes the fact that the decision was a good or a bad one in the start.
Please not that I'm not saying that every investment in bitcoin or anything else should be risk free, I'm just saying that pulling out your 401k and investing it in something new and highly risky is stupid.

I'm pretty sure that's the bank's full time job, and plus it's not like that's going to happen for the rest of his life. Apple and/or your bank will find a way to stop fraudulent transactions from happening in case your auth token gets leaked. Unlike your private bitcoin wallet key getting released for example.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:25:29
No. They don't allow selling of bitcoin, or any other currency  for that matter. You can sell mining rigs etc with paypal.
And CEO of PayPal says the company is "believer in BTC"


The problem is when some employees misinterpret the rules  and ban someone for (anything) bitcoin related, this is however not something that PayPal does intentionally.
@_date: 2014-08-31 14:06:35


I honestly have no idea I think it was OUR, but there were no additional fees on recipients end.
See this page for comparison of various ways to transfer money: 
(There is no Serbia on the list, but it's roughly the same thing)
For sending 1k euros the fees vary from 0.15% (1.50EUR) to 6.25% (62.50EUR) with average being around 20ish euros 
The easiest and fastest way is to just go to WU and transfer money online for 5EUR fixed fee and it's done in minutes, or use postbank and pay just 1.5EUR and have it done in 3-5 days.

Well it was a stupid decision, the fact that you got lucky and earned some money with it doesn't change the fact that at the time it was highly risky and therefore stupid decision.
It's equivalent of pulling out your 401k and putting it all on one number on roulette, even if you win the decision was stupid to begin with and the final outcome doesn't change that.

In that specific case, buyer could sue paypal if they refused refund:
You list the item for $5k. Your friend buys the item. You give him money back - nowhere indicated that it's for the purchase. Your friend asks paypal to refund him the money (as they promised), they refuse, your friend can sue paypal/ebay for not delivering product/issuing refund as agreed by their buyer protection. 
I'm not saying that's the only way - it's just the first thing I thought of (and it may be flawed).
The point is, there are clear instructions on how to issue refund and you didn't follow them and therefore have no proof that the transaction is related to the ebay listing.

Too bad their mobile app sucks and looks ugly, they don't even support their own features like broadcasts. Metadata on a lot of files is wrong too.

It's not paypal's fault then and it's something that *any* company would do.
They see that you sold the item and recieved money for it but never delivered/shipped it, of course they'll side with the buyer here.
@_date: 2014-11-24 09:22:47
It's not really free though, having accountants do all the additional work may not be worth it, and you also need to implement all features such as refunds etc if needed. 
I know for a fact, since it was posted in this subreddit by reddit CEO, that reddit is (or was) losing money by accepting bitcoin even though the conversion itself is free.
Plus setting automated renewals is much easier with CCs.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:51:57
Not really, the token is like password hash. It's enough to change the token generation algorithm for the old token to be invalid and new one created using your fingerprint.

First I don't believe you had to do double chargeback if the first one is done properly. (e.g. you sent refund via paypal/ebay's tools for such things) Secondly, you could have just called your bank and stopped the transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-20 10:53:23
Agreed. I stumbled upon this thread looking for some tips for myself about finding work and getting paid in bitcoin. The issue is that nobody (or extremely small number of people), not only businesses, pays in bitcoin. 
I'll give you my personal example. I wanted to buy/get small amount of bitcoins, ~$50-$100 worth, looking at the fees etc I thought to myself that I'll just find a small programming job, do that, get paid in bitcoin and call it a day. Apparently that's impossible to find and do. 
I could go on any number of freelance sites and get paid by the end of the day that amount (even though their prices are usually extremely low) via PayPal or similar payment method, this is impossible to do with bitcoin at the moment. 
In the end I just gave up because It's not worth my time spending days looking for jobs that pay in bitcoin while missing out on other offers. I've also thought about making something open source but looking at various donation addresses for smaller/medium projects apparently nobody spends their bitcoins on that either (although that isn't a bitcoin specific issue).

Well, depends on what the author meant exactly. It is not possible for your bitcoins to just disappear because you made a transactions as far as I know.

You can get it even cheaper, USA botnets are valued higher because they usually have paypal/CC info on them. You could get 10k botnet for ~$150, although you'll lose clients constantly due to detection/new OS/ or if you use some free RAT you'll get botkilled etc. but you still should be able to earn *at least* double as much as you invested in 1-2 days.

I know that likes the whole "freedom of speech", fuck the government/mods circlejerk. But letting community vote on things and not having community rules(or having them but not following 'em like here) is not good for topic specific subreddit. 
The "let the community vote" thing has been tried on multiple subreddits including pretty big ones like f7u12 IIRC, and it has never worked, the posts and comments became really bad really fast. 
The current subreddit content is already abd could be *a lot* better with just little moderation. There is no need for 10 posts about cyprus, no need for 20 posts about BTC being  worth $__.__, etc. I'm not saying that mods should forbid discussions about topics like this, but keeping them in as little as possible threads would be better.

It probably got asked a lot recently because reddit started accepting it and people don't understand what it is, thus a lot of ELI5 submissions. I wouldn't really say it's due to bitcoins going "mainstream" globally.
Also IMO that's the reason why it hasn't gone mainstream by now; average person needs someone to explain them "like they're 5" what bitcoins are because it's too complicated.

Well it needs more of... everything, most important points IMO:
* As you said stable prices, huge increases like in the last month are *not* good. We need slow but steady increase.
* More adoption by various websites, stores etc and a way for them to spend bitcoins, not just take bitcoins and convert them to USD instantly.
* More opportunities to exclude the $&gt;BTC and vice-versa step. For example: company offering some services that accepts bitcoins could pay their employees in BTC, they wouldn't need to convert them to USD. And employees will avoid USD to BTC step if they can buy everything they need with BTC. 
These steps will make it possible to avoid USD or any other currency completely and make people consider bitcoin "real" currency and therefore make it go more mainstream. That would be ideal scenario IMO, but it's still waaaay to early to even guess if that will happen.

I don't downvote posts that I don't "like". I usually downvote stuff that is either spam, in wrong subreddit, false and similar stuff. I also don't downvote comments that are on topic just because I don't agree with them.


I think this is wrong and it's the main reason why I don't express in comments why I don't like spcific post. 
Posting something that some/most people might not like will probably not produce a discussion about the topic in a reasonable way, instead because people think of downvote as I-don't-agree-with-you button, it usually gets buried in few minutes and nothing comes out of it so I tend to just ignore the posts. Why should I spend my time writing something that only 4-5 people need to  see and downvote for it to be hidden from rest without even explaining why they did that?


There's nothing wrong with discussing these topics, but wouldn't it be better for everyone (except people who post for karma I guess) to keep discussion limited to one or two posts than making 10 nearly identical posts/discussions?


I find the democratic process on reddit i.e. upvotes/downvotes as a semi functional process that needs some help to function properly. Something like rediquette and subreddit/topc specific rules.
Anyway I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. I understand why for some (most?) people, including you, the current way works and they don't see the need for change. But in the long run it would definitely improve the content of this subreddit.

To earn money. Authors usually get paid to bundle their installation with something. I think sourceforge even adds option to do it automatically and then devs get percentage.


That sort of is like ads except it gets shown only once during installation. Also labeling it as malware is false, it's shitty software but it isn't malicious (in 99% of the cases).


If you're using your distro repos then no however developers can bundle their app with whatever they want, including, additional software that gets offered during installation. (Assuming you're not installing from source)
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:17:00


No. At least I don't see any other reason. 
Slight increase is due to higher number of websites accepting it, mega, reddit etc. And some people investing in long term success of bitcoins. And the rest is people speculating that it will be worth a lot. 
Because most people are "investors" interested in quick profit/easy money and not really interested in bitcoin's success they will sell as soon as price starts dropping constantly for a day or two and the "bubble" will pop quickly, but because bitcoin is more widespread and stable, so to speak, it will not go down to &lt;$5 like in 2011. It will probably go somewhere between $20-$30.

And as far as your question to goes: Those are global rules that everyone should follow BUT there are no clear instructions in official mod FAQs on what to do as moderator in such case.
But I don't see why the mods are risking bans of their accounts just to keep the post. Admins could ban them for allowing vote manipulation/breaking of site wide rules.
What I would do as mod:
* Remove the post
* Contact admins, if they say it's OK then re-allow the post otherwise let them deal with banning of the account if necessary and keep the post removed.
It's not like the thread contains a lot of useful comments anyway...

Depends on your definition of stable. But if you have all your savings in USD(or pretty much any other currency) there is significantly less chance that it will be worth 10%-20% less(or more) overnight. 
That might, and probably will, change over the next few years but right now BTC is not "stable". Suggesting someone to invest their savings in BTC without saying that it could go either way is wrong and shouldn't be done.
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:30:16


Yes. But I think that bitcoin would have to be pretty popular among common people for that to happen, it's a Catch 22 thing. Big important businesses won't accept it because minority/none of their customers would use it, and people won't use it because their businesses don't support it.
If/when a large important business starts accepting it it will certainly have impact on the price but I don't really expect something major like few hundred % increase over few days, like it would happen now. Bitcoin will be much more stable and widespread before big companies start accepting it, primarily because many other smaller companies and common people would already use it.
Of course it's possible for a big company to start accepting bitcoin right now, that would really drive up the prices and it would just be a mess so I think the slow, but constant, adoption is better. Same goes for price increase. I'd rather have 1% a month increase than 100% one month, then 50% decrease followed by 40% increase and so on.

Since zerocoin is not usable I won't comment on it.
As far as mixing service goes, you don't know that there is no data stored/shared that would make mixing coins obsolete to anyone with such data. And if you do 1000 mixes and put money through 1000 addresses and just use one of them to buy something like humblebundle where you enter your email address it would be possible to track every single transaction on every address to your email.

I haven't invested anything. I think that the price isn't really stable for short term investments, and I want to see bitcoin more used before I invest and hold on to them for longer time. Even though doubling your investment in a month sounds appealing it's too risky for me. 
That said, I did earn some bitcoins (very little) which I intend to keep for long(er) time and I'm working on a betting related website as a hobby project which I *hope* will bring me some bitcoins either by donations if it's open source or by earning bitcoins because if it's closed source (probably the latter), either way I'm doing it more to learn about working with bitcoins than something that I believe will make me "rich".

1. Bot logs in to reddit using [reddit API]( It basically "opens"  with username and password as parameters. This isn't necessarily the first step, but it makes sense to do it first since it will be required later.
 **1a**. Bot opens /api/me.json the same way as comments in step 2 to obtain valid "modhash" required in step 4.
2. Bot opens  in either `json` or `xml` format for example:  (Edit: to see json "sorted" and not just as text mess install [this extension]( This way it's easier for bot to go through the comments since you don't need to go through all that html/css/javascript that is used to make comments look nice when you use browser.
3. Bot goes through comments visible on that page and checks each if it matches some criteria, for example does it contain word "this is spam" does it contain specific link and so on, and if it does it removes it (step 4) if it doesn't then it's just ignored and then the next comment is parsed.
4. Removal of comments is done in a similar way as the login. Bot submits request to reddit.com/api/remove but instead of username and password like in step 1 it sends comment id, valid modhash and if the comment should be marked as spam, marking comment as spam "trains" reddit's own anti spam module, not marking it as spam just removes.
5. Bot waits few seconds/minutes and starts again from step 2.
Some stuff is simplified, it would make sense to check if comment is removed in the meantime before trying to remove it, check modqueue for reported comments, keep list of removed and scanned comments in database etc, ban spammers automatically etc.
Also there are already API wrappers like `PRAW` that make this process pretty simple, but without using any 3rd party modules that's, basically, how it would go.
I can write a simple bot in python if you want to see it explained with code, I didn't do it now to keep comment shorter and I'm not sure if anyone is interested in that anyway...

Agreed, but I saw it often recommended (besides selling btcs in person) as a way to sell your bitcoins and get money.


I didn't know the specific numbers, thanks! Sure it's 3 times "cheaper" but IMO 3% isn't a big number and I don't mind paying that fee for the service that's accepted pretty much everywhere and with which I never had any issues.


Sure, even if you pay in cash you're risking being scammed. Paypal has a more "integrated" way of protecting buyers using escrow services is doable if both parties agree but it requires (although small amount of) additional work for doing (basically) same thing as paypal (from a buyers perspective)


No, my point is that most people don't understand how computer security works and thus won't take responsibility for securing their digital money they'd rather have someone else, who knows about that stuff, do all the work.


Yes, of course. But to be fair this happens to really small amount of accounts/users.


Those can be "stolen" by brute forcing them, right?


Web services can be, and have been, hacked. Tracking stolen bitcoins and possibly getting money back is much harder than if my CC # and/or PP account got hacked/stolen.


I did some research when I looked into how to and where to keep my own bitcoins. I probably don't know details as a lot of redditors on this sub but I'd say that I know most common ways of keeping bitcoins. (I settled for blockchain.info online wallet + 2 step auth)


I only used it payment processor to buy last 2 humble bundles. I haven't used them for anything else but besides offering the BTC&gt;USD service to merchants it's like most other online wallet services AFAIK and has same flaws I mentioned above. And unless I have some bitcoins already I don't see point is buying bitcoins then exchanging those bitcoins to USD (automatically using coinbase) before they go to merchant.
I like bitcoin but right now it's nowhere near ready for general consumption. No system is perfect, Banks/CCs/PP/Bitcoin all have their flaws, but right now the advantages bitcoin has compared to other services aren't relevant to an average consumer and disadvantages are too big to ignore. As more services and products form around bitcoin most of the issues I mentioned in my previous comments will be resolved but until then saying that it's same and/or better than other services is false.

You are over confident in success of bitcoins, it's impossible to tell if it will be successful. Some people don't like risky stuff, and they're not interested in it. Just looking one possible future of bitcoin(or anything else) is wrong.


You're posting the article to . An article with 300+ points and 700+ comments about bitcoins was there yesterday. And I'm pretty sure that most of the users over there have heard about it, it's not like you're submitting this to or some similar subreddit.
And I don't have any issues with posting bitcoin related articles in The whole "I posted article to r/____ [link to post]" and  "is discussing bitcoins [link to post]" stuff looks just like posts i.e. "Someone has different opinion about something, let's get him!" or "Let's upvote this to show that we're right and they wrong"

Do you seriously need convincing that you can't do more stuff with bitcoin than with credit card? Really?
Then followed by a statement that also means "no."
Because: No. You can't. That shouldn't even be up for discussion, you can't. End of story. There is no more to be said to your comment than simple "It's not true". If you presented some proof that supported your claims I'd be happy to discuss that, but you didn't.
My response: Stop posting comments that are not true. How is untrue comment considered "content"? There is absolutely no way that you can do more stuff with bitcoins than with credit cards. 
Again: Post something that supports your claims otherwise it's just false statement that doesn't deserve more than simple "No, it's not true" response.

Not sure if this applies to you, but reddit is losing money on accounting stuff when they accept bitcoin for reddit gold (they are also using coinbase iirc). If you don't have such expenses, or they're less than CC fees, I don't see any drawbacks for implementing bitcoin payments.

Both of you are using word "*when*" instead of "*if*" like you should.
What many people don't realize is that others see bitcoin something like lottery, sure you could "invest" $10 and maybe you will be able to buy a house but maybe it will be worthless in few years. So a lot of people will say I'd rather have something(like forum account) right NOW for $10 than MAYBE a house in few years for the same amount of money.
You could buy lottery ticked and IF you win you'll be rich, same could be said about bitcoins. We just don't know, and can't know, if it will be successful. Maybe it has better chances of making someone rich than lottery ticked but the point still stands.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:01:56
If you had some knowledge in the area you probably wouldn't.
'Investing' now is terrible idea IMO if you intend to make a quick profit. 
It might be a bit safer to invest in long run (at least few years), but even that isn't really safe because bitcoin is still something completely new and it's too early to speculate right now.

I completely agree. I think the bitcoin in itself is awesome, but majority of users on are worse than those on and similar subreddits.
And this community is too circlejerkish(OMG $30 BY FRIDAY!!!ON3!!1  post) and way too optimistic about future of bitcoin("I think btc will be worth OVER $9000 in 6 months +999 points/upvotes)*
Also complaining about ____ not accepting bitcoin. No. Shut up. They're not accepting it because 99.999% of their customers don't even know what bitcoin is. And for that 0.001% it's not worth it.
Reminds me a bit of google+, it's awesome, better than competition, nobody who you want uses it, and the community is shit. 
Oh and negative comment about bitcoin that is true? hidden because it has too much downvotes and of course everybody who downvoted it didn't comment explaining why they downvoted.
People here should really take a step back and look at things more realistically before commenting and realize that it doesn't matter how much they might want something to happen it probably won't. Especially stuff like bitcoin.

No one can tell certanly. If you buy now it could crash and you'd lose money in the short run and maybe earn something in few months/years. It is also possible that it will continue to rise and even if you buy at $50 you could sell it when it rises.
Both options are possible, **I** personally wouldn't buy now, the price will fall IMO.
Again, nobody can tell you what to do, but whether you decide to buy now or wait **never buy more than you can afford to lose.** This is same as gambling, you could win or lose.
If you think that bitcoin will be worth $1000+ in the next few years and you plan on holding bitcoins until then it doesn't really matter if you buy at $50 or $20. But it's also possible that bitcoin fails and that in few years instead of being worth $1k it will be worth like $0.01.
Don't listen to whatever people say on the internet, decide for yourself. But you should know that bitcoin is currently in stage where it could go either way, in both short and long time frame.
@_date: 2013-09-15 12:44:48
You are aware that bitcoin isn't anonymous and that everyone can see all transactions, right?
I'm pretty sure that NSA can easily backtrace bitcoin transaction to you, especially if you bought them via bank/cc transfer, and even if you didn't you'll probably link them to some identifying information, such as email, sooner or later.

Add automod and set it up to remove heavily reported comments that would solve the comment spam issue probably. Mods could occasionally  check removed comments for the ones that aren't spam and re-approve them. But this shouldn't really be an issue.
I think that currently suggested mods are too much into bitcoin as the best thing ever and solution to all world problems, I  think they would remove any "negative" article/comment about bitcoin.
Edit: my suggestion: find someone outside of this subreddit to be added as mod. Someone who doesn't know anything about  bitcoins but can identify spam,
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:30:05
You wouldn't need to do that. The best solution is automod but even simple python script that just removes all ascii characters and spaces, for example, and checks if url is somewhere in there would work.
Something like this:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'spamstring' in 'sometextwithoutspacesthatalsohasspamstringinit'
    True
     comment
Adding few more rules and keeping the exact algorithm "secret" would probably get rid of the spam.
And using `PRAW` the whole thing wouldn't be more than 30ish lines of code.

It'll be almost impossible to find someone who can tell you that you can, or can't have donations in your app. Some apps in the market do have PP and other methods of donation and some get removed as soon they implement such option...

As TheMania explained,most transactions can be paid for via paypass/paywave anyway.


Is this US only thing? I can go online and make a transaction which will be done in an hour or so and the person has immediate access to funds.


First part I agree, it would be easier with bitcoin, but I'm not so sure I want everyone to have access to my payment history...
I also can log in and see all transactions to and from my account with account # that transferred funds to me, so if I were a landlord I could just view transactions and see if you paid your rent or not. I can also set SMS/email alerts so I get notified right away when you pay me.


You can do same with paypal or online banking.

What I wanted to say is: when the price falls in the coming days/weeks it won't go below $25, i.e. it won't go down to like $1-2 as in 2011. I didn't mean to say that it will never go below/over $25 mark.
In long run it's possible* that one bitcoin will be worth more than $1k but it certainly won't reach high and sustainable price rising like 100% in a month.
*This depends on a lot of factors and may not even ever happen.

This community is one of the worst on reddit and is same as SRD/SRS as far as forcing communty's opinion in other subreddits goes.

I could go and buy stolen CCs easily and then buy bitcoins with them... And eventually there will be a chargeback and you'll be out of money while I will still have my bitcoins.
I won't actually do it, I'm just pointing out one of the easiest way to (mass) abuse this that will hurt you...

There is very very very small chance that they might find your transaction suspicious and freeze your money, if you're in US they don't have to follow the same laws as banks so they can keep your money longer, if you're in EU they have to follow same laws as banks so you have EU law protecting you that means that, besides other consumer protection laws etc they can't keep your money indefinitely like you hear a lot of US redditors complain. (I'm not sure how long(or if there's even a limit) they can keep your money if you're in US)
If you're a seller there is *slightly* higher chance that your money will be frozen for some time because you have higher number of transactions to your account, but still that happens very rarely.
@_date: 2013-08-01 10:25:39
People don't really hate bitcoin directly, they hate the fact that it's promoted as real money even though most of them think it's not, mainly because:
* Most people who use and "promote" bitcoins, especially on reddit, are very annoying about it.
* Risky -- prices fluctuate making it not so safe and not "real money". (I don't care if USD lost half its value in the last 20 years, bitcoin does that monthly. Don't even try to compare it) ^(*Made up numbers)
* Not noob friendly enough -Encryption, wallets, hashes, blockchain etc is something most people don't understand and don't want to worry about especially if it's supposed to be currency. If you want to own bitcoins you should pretty much spend few hours reading to be "safe", yes services like online wallets exist but if those got hacked you'd lose your money.
* Not available  enough -- Harder to acquire than other currencies, only way to get them is to either try and find some work to do for bitcoins(Pretty much impossible or way underpaid in my experience), or verify your identity on some site and then use your CC/Bank account to buy them.
* "Useless" -- No advantages to everyday currencies (No I'm not sending thousands of dollars to some 3rd world country. No I never had any issues with PayPal. No the fees for sending money aren't too big.) And compared to $/eur etc I can spend it only on ridiculously small number of items. (Not counting services that do the BTC&gt;USD&gt;Buying item for you, that's just buying stuff for USD). I've personally had some bitcoins and I just didn't know what to buy with them that I needed and/or couldn't buy with my CC/PP.
* Bad experiences -- You can find a lot of stories about people who bought bitcons and lost them, either the value decreased significantly or they were hacked or their wallets got deleted


* Most arguments say that it's a scam in a way that's it's only made to make few developers who got in early really rich (because they probably have a lot of bitcoins). 
* There are a lot of "buy bitcoins you'll be rich" comments during the bubble building phases which make it also sound like a get-rich-quickly scheme.
* It's often mentioned that one/or more persons can manipulate prices easily by buying and selling larger amounts of BTC at once, thus making BTC seem like a bad thing to use because few people can manipulate the market easily.
Well I could go on but this already turned into a wall of text which tend to be skipped when reading comments and I think I covered most of the points people make.
**tl;dr:** Awful annoying community promotes it as the best thing ever and solution to all world problems comparing it to WWW, internet and similar things even though most people don't even see it as a currency because it has too many flaws compared to benefits.  People don't think that bitcoin, as an invention/software/idea is essentially bad, they think it's bad as "currency" which is how most people promote it.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:32:24
Strong yes, but it definitely will be worth less. I'd say &lt;$100, so it makes sense to sell btc now and buy it in 2-3 weeks when the price stabilizes or risk a bit and buy it when it hits ~$90 and hope that it doesn't fall much more, anyway you'll make profit.

While it's true that they only accept bitcoin they could be expressing profits in USD. They didn't specify that.
And if you take the current price of bitcoin they could be making more profits (in USD) but same or slightly more amount of bitcoins.
They could mean something like this:
At the end of 2012 we earned 1,000 bitcoins valued $10,000 at the time.
So far we have earned 250 bitcoins worth $11,500.

I'm sorry if it seemed like I wanted to point out that I was smart or whatever. I'm not.
The point I was trying to make is that it's easy to do that everyone with at least a little experience can make, it's nothing special. And in it's current state it's just not ready to present to reddit or somewhere else. 


The website looks too spamish and "old" so that just by visiting it first time I'm not sure I'd expect it to have up to date and accurate data. (I know it has, I'm just saying if I visited it for the first time)


I suck at design. That's why I suggested for you to use bootstrap.


There's nothing wrong with that, but at least put some description what it's about. Right now I'd never expect that picture to be link, and I wouldn't visit the site because I have no idea what it's about. For new users if you put some description like "Beginner tutorials" or whatever you'd probably get more hits.


Ask yourself why are all the others doing that? If I had to guess I'd say it's frequently used feature.


I'm not really insulted fyi, you need to work more on your insults.
I was trying to help. Why would I go to your site and see how much 1BTC is worth and then calculate how much 13.241457BTC is worth manually when _all_ other sites offer that calculations.
And you should also work more on accepting criticism, you seem offended and you take it too personally because someone pointed out the flaws in your idea/website.
If you're "learning and experimenting" wouldn't it make more sense to implement as much as possible functions instead of just parsing one JSON file?

Since zerocoin is not usable I won't comment on it.
As far as mixing service goes, you don't know that there is no data stored/shared that would make mixing coins obsolete to anyone with such data. And if you do 1000 mixes and put money through 1000 addresses and just use one of them to buy something like humblebundle where you enter your email address it would be possible to track every single transaction on every address to your email.

In essence they're both pretty much the same. While mtgox has issues users who use it will not be able to withdraw funds, while well's fargo has issues its users can't withdraw from their CCs. You don't have to use neither well's fargo nor mtgox, and if you don't you would not be having any issues with withdrawing funds at the moment.

You should also explain to your friend or whoever when you share this and before you get them to invest anything in BTC that it may be worthless instead of "worth thousands of dollars per coin". 
I don't understand why most of the infographics, guides etc point out just one possible future for bitcoin. Although in this case it's clearly to promote some site(s).

Content that's suitable for should be voted up or down by community. But moderators should moderate the content i.e. decide what's suitable either by themselves or by having a mod post and letting other users decide.
Having more than 1 or 2 threads about specific price is not necessary. Limiting when such posts are allowed is also a good idea. Posting "all time high" each time BTC rises $5 shouldn't be allowed and not left up to community to moderate.(not much of that, but just an example) because posts like that will always be moderately upvoted because a lot of people didn't see the previous, similar, posts.
Circlejerk posts do not encourage discussion and are pretty much useless.
I just think that for a subreddit to be about something, in this case bitcoins, it needs to be moderated more. When a new user comes to bitcoin specific subreddit I doubt he expects, or is pleased to see general financial news and circlejerk/memes. 
Self post fridays or something would also increase discussions. Stuff like that is what moderators, in my opinion should do.
Some guidelines for commenting and posting would also be nice.
This subreddit has 20k subscirbers. I do not know of any topic specific subreddit that doesn't turn to shit with that number of subscribers (and rising) and without moderation.
I understand what you're saying, I know the benefits of community moderated subreddit. But I just think that's the wrong approach here.
And this subreddit definitely doesn't need type of moderation. I agree with that.
I'd love to see at least a week or two of heavy moderation just to see the differences. Right now I'm just guessing what would be better and speaking from my experiences as moderator in (smaller) subreddits. I may be completely wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:27:42
I'm posting here hoping that I'll get tipped by But seriously, the best thing for bitcoins even though the price is dropping is continued support/acceptance by everyone. Without that it would have become worthless. So even though I'm not from US or care about libertarian party this is good news. 
Just wondering though, how big is this party in US? Is this huge deal or just a minor party accepting BTC and not a really big deal? And have there been any other political parties(anywhere) that accept BTC before this one?

You're not allowed to use the word "Bubble" around here, you'll just get downvoted by people who think that this kind of increase is normal and that it means that bitcoin will be worth few millions by 2015. And that their dreams of moving out of their parents basement into their own basement will become reality.


Just look at frontpage I think you'll see answer to your question.
I'm not very involved in bitcoin community but I can tell you with absolute certainty that if you want proper discussion this (isn't the right place. It's full of over excited teenagers and neckbeards who truly believe they will become rich over night, overthrow goverment, destroy every other currency with bitcoin and they refuse to listen or engage in proper discussion about anything else than the idea of 1btc=$1m or some other similar insane ideas.
I personally think this is clearly a bubble but it won't go down to $1-2. If I had to guess I'd say that it won't go below $25.... But that's just a guess, no one can really tell.

Run your own version that supports bitcoins if you think there's enough users that would pay for it using BTC to make it worth it. If the developer isn't interested in btc it's just more work for like $12/year minus the costs per user minus the fees to convert it to USD.

It would be pretty easy, blockchain has nice API which you can use to get address info including amount of btc the address. The rest is just displaying the information in a pretty way.
I'm sure you could find someone to do this 0.5BTC or less.
And if you already have similar, open source, version changing it to display bitcoin should be very easy.
If nobody does this or provides already existing project I'll (try and) do it in few hours for free.

These kind of submissions remind me of SRS/SRD subreddits where subscribers technically post links to submissions/comments outside of their subreddits just to make more people downvote the global opinion and promote their own. 
If the article is informative enough and you think it's fitting for just submit it and shut. the. fuck. up. This is practically begging for upvotes to "force" other users, who are not interested in bitcoins, to see bitcoin related articles.

Can someone explain to me how bitcoin, in its current form, is good replacement for paypal for an average person, especially buyers?
* Irreversible transactions -- No buyer protection, most sites that accept bitcoin don't offer escrow services
* Price changes daily -- Not good if I buy bitcoins right now and in few hours I need another 0.001BTC to buy the same product because price fell few dollars
* Requires understanding of how wallets work, how to backup, how to keep it safe etc.
* Besides buying them in person or mining them they're harder to acquire than just using PP. (Otherwise I have to rely on 3rd party exchange to not freeze my money, kinda like PayPal)
* Most sites don't support bitcoin, using BTC&gt;USD services is then pointless it would be better to stick to sites that use some other CC processing besides PP (something like stripe)
I think bitcoin, if it survives long enough, will be great API-like service used in backends of sites similar to paypal which would use USD as frontend, user payments (something like coinbase). Right now it just isn't capable of being paypal replacement and suggesting it as something like that is... well not a good advice.

But what are the chances of that? I'd say less than most of the odds to win on SD. Also tips, in general, are given to a really small amount of comments so I'd say it's safer to play on SD instead of what you're doing.

IIRC there was workaround/fix for it for about 2-3 days before the exploit was released. Although short time, it's enough to fix this highly critical exploit. I find it hard to believe that he/they didn't hear about it. It was everywhere.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:26:18
Well, you don't really know chances of bitcoin being worth a lot, you are only speculating. So yes in theory potential gains from bitcoin are unlimited but also, in theory, gains from roulette are also unlimited (it is not 100% certain that you will only win certain number of games).
Comparing 25 years of holding bitcoins i.e. long term speculation and playing roulette one time isn't really a fair comparison for potential financial gain.
@_date: 2013-03-09 17:51:56
Well first of all it depends on how much money you're considering investing.
For example if you have only $2k then even if bitcoins fail you won't lose much. If you have 50k the risk is obviously bigger.
I personally wouldn't invest more than 50%, assuming it's larger amount of money.
Are you prepared to lose your whole investment?
It doesn't matter that bitcoin has been rising rapidly lately, it's not easy risk free money as most people believe. It's completely possible that it will be worthless in a year or two.
Also post this question to some non bitcoin related investment websites/subreddits. Like @_date: 2013-11-03 16:51:30
But you don't know risk % or possible reward with bitcoin investments, what kind of risk/reward ratio are you talking about? In both cases the worst case scenario is you lose 100% of your investment and best case scenario is practically unlimited financial gain.

I don't send money often using PP but I don't remember it taking so long, not saying that you're not telling the truth it's just that I didn't have such experience.


 Instant *bitcoin* transfer, if the people want to use USD they have to rely on whichever service they're using to process their sell order and transfer money to their bank account, which could take 6-8 days also (Assuming they're verified). I've read stories from people waiting more than a month to get their money from mtgox to bank account.


For bitcoin transfers, for btc&gt;usd it will probably cost a little bit, not much but still technically not "free".


Yes, from a seller standpoint this is great but from a buyers standpoint you could just take bitcoins and never deliver whatever I bought and I'll have much harder time (currently) proving that you took bitcoins and didn't deliver the product because most people won't understand what bitcoins are (Going to police station with bitcoin transaction ID probably wouldn't be same as filing a chargeback with PP). It's much more safer for me, as a not-douchebag buyer, to use PayPal because they protect me more.


I could call my bank on first suspicious transaction and block my CC and maybe reverse transaction, PayPal doesn't really get hacked every day and with a little caution if I pay attention to url and avoid phishing websites I'm pretty safe. With bitcoin if my wallet password gets lost my money is gone. If my HDD dies it's gone. If someone takes my wallet file my money is gone. With paypal I don't have to worry about their servers, hdds etc and they have much smarter people than me working on security.


Yes, I agree.. kinda. People are uncomfortable with the idea of being responsible for money which works in a way they don't understand, read my  point above not noob friendly enough. And it's much harder to be sure that a file on my computer is safe than for example my physical wallet with USD/EUR in it.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:42:10
Corrected to reflect real supply and demand. I don't think this price increase is just because higher demand. It's just a bubble.
The price will fall down to (my guess) something like $25 and then it will raise more slowly but the price will be more stable, which is good thing IMO. 100% value increase in short time does not imply currency stability.
I am however not even close to an economic expert so I may be wrong.

I think this is wrong place to ask.
Here everyone wants to support bitcoin and they will answer positively.
The only good thing is that you can promote your "store" on bitcoin related websites if you accept it. And perhaps increase your sales due to more advertising. 
I'd suggest just adding bitcoin payments to your website and not adding it to ebay just in case they don't like it and ban you. Most people who are browsing ebay don't really rely on buyer accepting bitcoin anyway, it's not worth risking your account for few sales IMO.

To be fair for most users bitcoin also, in a way, isn't cash. Most people still require 3rd party to exchange their BTC to USD to buy products relevant to them. I'm not saying that everything works this way, but for an average person that's the way it goes. Which is kinda same like paypal, you have to trust the 3rd party to handle your money the way you want it.


This does happen, but not really often(compared to number of users). Huge percentage of PP users don't need to worry about this.


Seeing how average person doesn't care about being anonymous I don't think they'll care. And very small percentage sends money to foreign countries. Especially Ethiopia, Kenya like someone else mentioned.
What I'm trying to say is: Everything that you said is true and correct, but for most people bitcoin is solving problems that they don't have and therefore they won't use it and are not interested in it. That's one of the main reasons I don't see bitcoin as serious competitor in the next, at least, 10 years like everyone else seems to think in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 04:38:12
There is no doubt that many, if not all, issues I outlined above will be solved as bitcoin gets more adopted and stable. I was just saying that in its current form it should not be recommended as paypal replacement to people who just want to buy stuff and not worry about stability of bitcoins, how widely they're accepted etc.
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:34:44


No it's not. You'll see "correction" in 2 weeks max. Not as bad as the one from 2011, but still noticeable.
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:58:16
It's not just about sources, the whole site is weird. For example here's what you have one after another:
1 bitcoin to usd: 43.599 
1 bitcoin worth in usd? 43.599
bitcoin exchange rate 43.599/USD
1 bitcoin is worth 43.599 USD
You wrote the same thing 4 times little differently, completely unnecessary.
Then you have link in ALL CAPS without any specific explanation other than "real cryptographic currency" Then below that you have, as simple text:
 "bitcoin Bitcoin"
below that you have image that links to something without any description.
Below that you have "1btc to usd" text, which is useless.
Then some unrelevant text, some SEO attempt that failed? Text like  "Previously owned, in excellent condition In stock! Order now!" No links, no description. Nothing.
To be completely honest the way the site looks now I would first assume it's some scam, then perhaps some poor attempt at promoting getbit.info.
I wouldn't even trust it to provide correct exchange rate for BTC/USD.
And the whole only one BTC and only USD thing also sucks. Sure I mostly want to first see 1btc/USD price but after that I'll probably want to see how much something like 4.56BTC is worth. Why would I need to do that manually? I'd expect that functionality from a website since it's so easy to implement. I know that you did that on purpose, but it's not a good idea.
As I said it takes 10 minutes to make such website. You need to work more on it before you decide to promote it on reddit or anywhere else.
Here's what I made in 10 minutes, without copying any code or anything and it has BTC/USD and BTC/EUR and custom amounts support. And that's pretty much all you need on homepage
 | [code](
Use twitter boostrap or something and offer SIMPLE good looking BTC/USD conversion on homepage but also offer more things on other parts of the website if you want it to be useful.

So, technically, you sell your items 5% cheaper so that you can invest money directly into bitcoin. Wouldn't it make more sense to sell items at normal price and then just invest that money? You'd get 5% more bitcoins.
