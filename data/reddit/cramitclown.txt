To be fair, who didn't love alt coins when they were six?
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:03:07
Yep, I signed up as well.

I failed algebra four times. I ain't Satoshi. In my defense they only offered it at 9 am which was just too early and I was too proud to drop it.

If they can get a large enough network it could destroy the  remittance business. I'm all for it.

BTC transaction volume is the most important stat to me. I've watched it closely for a while and I'm stoked at the direction. However it does not feel particularly strong to me during this point in it's young life. 
It is nice to see the trend in volatility is looking a lot better. 
I'm trying (failing) to take a long 3-5 year view of things.
I'm long btc and I mine on machines that will never cover their cost.

Ebay's goal used to be 15% of every sale.
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:32:08
I also have now heard of it. Now it's a thing.
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:01:10
Wow, this is huge.

Well, it was the name of the of the man who saved my grandfather during the war. So I chose it in honor of him.

I hadn't seen it.

They're adorable, just like puppies.

I don't think you have spoken to many five year olds.

I'm doing this to every one of my old drives and sprinkling them around the thrifts stores of America. This is too funny.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:59:40
So this is a validation of the large block model?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:31:56
Can you give an ELI5 on this?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:26:02
Clearly there is lots of stupidity on both sides. 
We'll get a clearer picture when segwit is released and when BCH is up to speed and we can get a true understanding of bitcoin transaction rates and segwit throughout.
The goal should be a low cost fast secure transaction network. But people weren't working toward an ultimate goal, instead they were working toward defending entrenched positions.
I am excited to watch this play out.

92-93. And Coinbase is AOL.

To be fair Gavin went off the reservation a year or so ago starting with the Craig Wright proof.
@_date: 2016-11-25 02:22:54
.20 fees will kill bitcoin.

I support having Gavin's commit rights revoked.

10 years price not equal to or greater than 421k US$ per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:03:33
And if I lose I'm killing it also. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:02:43
Well, let's go one btc. If you win, you kill it. Yes, I'll agree to swap info. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 07:17:08
I'll take that action.
@_date: 2016-10-06 03:42:37
If OneCoin closes then I recommend you check out OctaCoin. See, it's eight sided which is luckier. Get in early. /s
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:54:18
$10k in '17.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:18:38
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:44:43
You'll lose a lot of money if you sell at $3k.
@_date: 2016-10-06 05:16:29
We early investors don't really want to sell any...but would consider with a direct wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:11:42
Yeah, I bought on both sides of the crash. Average of about $800. I still hold. It was a long three years.

The one thing that most investing professionals admit is that it is very difficult to call a bubble while you are in it, but I still try.
I successfully called the 2008-2009 crash and was all in cash. I have failed completely in predicting the impending crash. I've been in all cash* for over a year and still nothing in sight.
I'm holding my investment in Bitcoin and I don't believe we are in a bubble. Bitcoin is going through a technology adoption curve. The first large run up was the early adopter bubble and the current run up is the early financial investor. There are many waves still ahead as the technology is simplified and consumer adoption comes along in 3-5 years.
I believe we will run at varying speeds to $10k. However I'll hold regardless as I believe it's a transformational technology.
*I'm keeping my Bitcoin investment regardless of my feelings about the markets. I believe it's a hedge against traditional markets.

A $490K day is a good day.

Read the article again. They are freezing 88%. And selling 12%. Out of 100 billion XRPs,  that's a shit ton.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:47:25
Damn you and your wiley maths!
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:26:01
Whoops, my bad. It was the 2013 crash. Thanks for the correction. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:13:29
Yes. But it will also go above $3k.
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:37:54
I'm in the new hardware camp. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:33:17
The transaction volume trend keeps me hopeful.

Psst....UK/EU is an awkward topic. Don't upset the islander.
