Interesting. I'll read your reply. thanks for the info.

This post has some flawed assumptions that make many of the arguments in that post invalid. This is a pretty good refutation here:

Fred Billy and Kevin all have similar reddit accounts to jm... is this a bot group? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:24:37
I can have just as many connections now it's called the internet.. I can VoIP with as many people as I want. Kind of makes the analogy a bit odd.

Once the payment goes to bitpay isn't it their problem or even further down the line the merchants problem? Can a bank be held liable if I withdraw cash and give it to a criminal and then that criminal uses that cash to do something illegal? I don't think so.

Gemini can complete that for you. I had a family friend make a similarly sized purchase through them and they had a very pleasant experience. 
Call them they have top notch support. If you do over the counter they can lock in the spot price for you they may hold the BTC until the KYC is complete though but you'll be able to lock a price relatively quickly if you have significant assets. 
+1 (866) 240-5113 is a number I found for them on google.

This is not true if you presume they'll only let verified account holders open lightning network channels with their exchange. If bitpay wants to act as a n MSB they'd open an account with the exchange, get verified then I could route to any of their merchants through the exchange's lightning network. My transaction to the exchange would be strictly between myself and the exchange same with their transaction between themselves and bitpay.

Or he may just believe, like satoshi, that a big part of scaling bitcoin is bigger blocks and go about promoting it in rather scummy ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:44:18
Pretty sure advocating spam is against reddit's rules but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:39:05
You should include core in the list of 'everyone' taking forever to support segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:52:49
 look at the gray band on the 2 week time scale. You're probably going to have a chance of confirmation on saturday or sunday.

TXid? Won't violate your privacy since it's exchange to exchange but I'd love to see proof of this claim so that I can repeat it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:37:55
The original bitcoin scaling method is to increase block size if you think satoshi was a good source on the scalability debate.

There are &gt; 160 BTC in transaction fees sitting in the mempool. It has been 24h since a 140+ sat/byte transaction confirmed since then it's all ben 200+ or higher. If you can't see a problem you are blind.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:02:36
Would help if core supported segwit natively in bitcoind and qt
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:11:55
Welcome to April. This has been going on for a while. Where do you think the ETH and LTC run ups in the beginning of the year came from? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:13:11
Hows the change address? Isn't it still legacy? I'll have to check github.
edit: Just checked... 'SegWit change outputs' still need to be implemented. According to that PR. 11167 says change outpus will happen in 11403 which is still open. Admittedly I've not tested this but will.

He'll have to sell more underpowered fireworks on ebay to end up there. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:46:32
core doesn't even make it easy to switch to segwit... have you tried implementing it? The change address in bitcoind is still legacy when using segwit... Once the core client supports it natively you'll see a lot more adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:55:34
Move fast. Break things. etc...
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:52:30
In just a bit under 5 hours if you factor in current growth rate of mempool. Also worth noting that it would also cost nearly an order of magnitude more to 'spam' the mempool on BCH than it would on BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:29:06
Have you tried using segwit with bitcoind? Most exchanges use the reference client released by core and it is a real pain to get it to do segwit. The change address is still using legacy format. As it stands implementing support for a bitcoin fork is easier than implementing segwit for companies using the reference client.

Coinbase supports **bitcoin** *cash* right now. Dump away.

It'd take a LONG time to hit the capacity of 10MB blocks + lightning. So whats the harm? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:35:46
Bigger blocks or faster blocks (lower blocktime)

Spoke a bit too soon it appears.

Maybe they should have run a 2x testnet and realized the code was buggy and ignored it for the nonsense that it was?

COLLUSION is the new pacifier for the weak minded. Just watch the cable news swaddle the masses with it's warm embrace.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:06:46
Yep ~ Including inflation from the coinbase we're paying miners collectively about $40,000,000/day last I checked.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:11:56
Core hasn't put segwit in the bitcoin core wallet yet... I think that is far more absurd.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:58:21
I dunno. I think it's in the March release but maybe it got pushed further. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:43:29
Agreed. I'm personally a proponent of a block-size increase and hold both coins and very much dislike the hate from both sides that has been going on. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:38:19
There is a reason we've been calling em shitcoins on bitcointalk for a long time. 
Disclaimer: Of course there are good altcoins but most of them are premined shitcoins at best and scamcoins at worst.

Monero has value. LTC has value if for nothing more than a BTC technology testbed. ETH has some value but is majorly over valued and has yet to be proven. That's about all I can think of though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:41


I’m gonna go with “probably not.”
That's not how that works... Trading volume in the last 6 months comes out to ~ 29,000,000 BTC. Using your logic that'd be impossible. I trade over 1,000 BTC in volume a week but don't have 1,000 BTC.

How is a fact FUD? I didn't provide any commentary beyond stating a fact.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:43:48
Whats actually pretty interesting is that with BTC's 10 minute block-time may prove to be an asset in a solar system scale deployment due to the time it takes for light to propagate. Second scale networks like ETH won't have a chance to operate at solar system scale due to latency issues.

I mean I love the memes just as much as the next guy. Been wondering about how this moment would feel since we were under $1/btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:09:57
They've been planning this since before the BCH fork.

So this post about Tether isn't FUD? Just tryna get my bearings because my last post about it before this incident was attacked quite a bit.

Damping, my bad. It's been a while since my electrical engineering and physics classes. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:58:57
I'd guess closer to 4-5 million minimum. Lots of us had tons when they were worth nothing in 2009/10 and just lost hdd's etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:20:22
It'll oscillate a bit because it doesn't have any dampening. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:04:25
I agree LN is very important but even with LN the opening and closing of channels at any significant scale will require more block space. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:44:26
Keep lawyers out of bitcoin.

Looks like it's maybe a bit too soon.

Poloniex will list it when it's actually live. Giving your BTC to ViaBTC now is not the best idea. I wouldn't even trust them with 1 DOGE. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:28:06
Basically if it has built-in replay protection they'll support it. I've not yet checked Bitcoin Cash's source to see if they put in replay protection but they'll be making a huge mistake if they don't... Although it won't be their first.
