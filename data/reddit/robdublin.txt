This tether scenario reminds me of the central banks printing money out of thin air in the form of quantitative easing, maybe the papers should report on that, EU doing 40billion a month now, down from 60 billin in Nov! 
I'd guess Tether isnt backed 100% but still, 2 billion of tether v 200 billion btc mrkt cap, not a fundamental concern.

No Capital Gains Tax in Malta as long as you dont remit the money into a malta. 
You can essentially buy residency there as long as you meet a few requirements, money earned outside of Malta as long as its not remitted into malta is tax free in terms of Malta tax, this applies to capital gains too unless your selling Maltese company shares or property.

Do the trade in your bank branch, have the teller count and deposit the money into your account, that way you are both on cctv, money is independently counted and verified as real then transfer the bitcoins

It will be more advantagous for retailers to accept bitcoin than credit/debit cards as they get their money faster and no fee to recieve. This will lead to greater adoption and possibly a discount offered by retailers to pay in bitcoin rather than credit/debit cards.

Yes, for USD. They'll also convert AUD and EUR and let you buy via USD too. No issues with that aspect!

BTCC! On the BCash split they credited my account but will not let me withdraw. They give no indication when they will allow me to after numerous correspondence. ROBBERY!
