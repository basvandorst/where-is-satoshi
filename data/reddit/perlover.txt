BitcoinPay generates SegWit addresses (P2WPKH), started from '3'
What do you mean doesn't support segwit? If you will pay from native segwit address payment will be ok. And and segwit wallet can send to non-segwit address but not versa.
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:53:35
Hi, i recommend the ahnames.com - they use CoinGate billing (Bitcoin + Lightning) ... ;)
@_date: 2018-06-15 05:00:10
I had same error for train reservation only (stage after choosing a bitcoin option before paying, right?). May be something was broken in that moment but I regular buy tickets there. 2 days ago I booked there the hotel room.
And you can try the site abitsky.com. There few high prices and they can sale tickets up to 24 hours before flight (destinia from 24 hours before). I used last site too!

Good time to use Lightning Network of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:59:21
I think it's not trusted tools. For example:
I am exchange. I don't have bitcoins but i know who (third-party HODLer) own a big volume of bitcoins. I collude with the latter. I ask him for few money ($100 for example) to make proof-of-reserve. He makes requested actions and make transaction. I present this transaction and assert that these are exhange's bitcoins. My users happy, i don't have bitcoins. And third-party HODLer is happy (he earned $100 but bitcoins under him control). And where proof-of-reserves?
@_date: 2019-02-26 23:35:49
You need Android, the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet (BLW) from market and the Thor incoming channel from the Bitrefill (costs ~ $3). No need Bitcoin node or Lightning node. The BLW uses light SPV protocol and it's lightning node...

It's not safe. Your mobile connected to internet and if your phone will be hacked or hacked NFC Tag application - bye bye bitcoins! There is other ways to lose bitcoins - your card can be scanned in public transport and many many cases... It's not cold  storage - it's very leaky vault

If you search more safe way - you need to use always offline computer + offline printer and JavaScript code from bitaddress.org or  at USB flash. Other way - to make USB bootable stick from Linux Mint distributive. It's instead offline computer.
@_date: 2019-02-03 01:12:19
1. Every application could save data in offline and to send when mobile will be online. I am about not only your application. I am about that cold storage created through mobile - not secure cold storage. It's hot storage.
2. Private key goes long way in phone to NFC. Application where key will be created, random generator, system bus and memory, other application which have the access to NFC interface and so on.
3. I am sure that the best way to create a cold wallet - to use offline one-off computer for example bootable live CD with Linux (i prefer Linux Mint fire example) with originated audited scripts for generation.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:40:54
This script: 
You run, Enter key, wait 2-3 hours -&gt; write seed, make password and etc, after to start and to wait syncing. In next day you have bitcoin node + lightning node, configured by auto!

Oops. I described to receive lightning payments. But the BLW can use Bitcoin payments too (only now all wallets to be able pay to Segwit addresses of BLW). But i think the lightning payments are better for pizza business: an immediate receiving and cheapest fees...
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:35:34
Old list.... For example the Expedia don't accept Bitcoin a long time
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:36:01
"The entire point of the lightning torch process is to test the strength and capacity of the network itself. Suppose I send you some money over the LN, instead of keeping it, you add a bit of your own money [maybe a couple of SATs] and then send it to another trusted person. Gradually this process will become more and more difficult and once the $4 million capacity is reached, it becomes almost impossible to continue the transactions as there are very few nodes present that can take that much capacity.”
It's mistake. Max amount is now 4M sats for one payment. It's not related with $4 mil capacity...
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:25:12
Better way to send all coins of wallet (where unconfirmed tx) to yourself with high fee. The lnd has option fee (sat/byte) but doesn't have "send all". You can try to send many times and slow decrease fee or sum...

I think better for you if you will not abandon the channel. You can remove channel keys now (by this operation) but later this unconfirmed transaction will be confirmed... But you will not have keys from this channel and will not be able to get control of your bitcoins in channel...

I was traveling too and i had exactly same problem too (Seychelles in my case - i had zero balance in Mycelium but when i switched to NordVPN servers my balance was showed right). I think your problem in ISP. Try VPN from NordVPN service for example (they accept bitcoin and you can pay with lightning through coupon service at bitrefill too). I recommend to try VPN server from CZ or from US.

@_date: 2019-01-31 14:07:00
I mean "private" term in context of lightning protocol. It means that the node of BLW will not be broadcasted in network for graph. The BLW uses a private channels. It not means that it hides payments. Your own node it's not private too in your context. You need to use onion routing of lightning which to be development yet...

If a changing of ISPs didn't help you can make a following (i saw same bug in other my device but there is not ISP bug):
1. Go to Android settings - Applications - Mycelium Wallet. There you should make stop application command and after there in Memory menu to make to clear cache (not data!)
2. Run the Mycelium. Go to tab Accounts - tap account and in right corner menu choose Refresh Account (i have not English interface version so there menu items can be few other names). To wait and you will see right balance.
After you can see right balance.

Android +  (BLW) + inbound Thor channel from the Bitrefill.com for $3 + 30+60 minutes to wait of opening channel and after you can accept Lightning (and bitcoin to segwit addresses)
No need to set up LN nodes and BTCPay! Only BLW! Your BLW will be your own LN node with private channel.

BLW uses the Olympus servers only to get help for routing. It happens when you want to pay. If user of BLW wants to receive a payment - the BLW generates an invoice and here the Olympus servers are not used and the more they can not know user payments of merchant if merchant uses the BLW.

No, BLW now can work for receiving payments with any node. You can use Lighting Conductor site for start receiving by BLW (only one exchange LN -&gt; BTC will resolve this problem)

It's not cold storage
A cold storage - it's safe way when private key was compromised one time. So a cold storage should have maxmimum one spent transaction. There (address 1M2bv6sypZSp6uAEC9U4Gzvgp6jd29F87e) were tons spent transactions. The private key was compromised more more times. I know one way for this cold storage - offline computer with Armory. But this type of storage could not be called as 'cold storage' in anyway. And in normal way a cold storage to be used only one time - one or more refills and one full spending.
If it was fantastic cold storage with tons of spent transactions i know one way of hack - if sign algorithm generates exactly same random number for signature one more time for an one or different transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:01:53
Sorry for delay with answer.
As i know the Bitpay takes 1% from merchants from transaction but rate for customer is about current exchange rate. So you pay 1:1
Bitpay uses BIP70 protocol. Some wallets doesn't understand their QR codes. But you can resolve it through DebitPay tools (Google it). You need only to copy URI from Bitpay (they have "copy link" button) and after decrypting by Debitpay you need to pay by any wallet.

You can compile from sources ( yourself. It's not difficult. You need only to install Node.js. And after your need to save it to flash for example your personal DeBitpay site :) I did it for one minute by only 2-3 shell commands
And yes, the Bitpay sucks! The BTCPay is the best. But this should be used by merchant. But the DeBitpay you can use yourself. And you can use the Electrum wallet for desktop - it understands BIP70 protocol

I used many times bitcoin packet wallets too. But i want to say that i more trust hardware wallet Trezor than software paper wallet.
