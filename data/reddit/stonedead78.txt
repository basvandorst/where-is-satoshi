It could really go either way. At any other time in the history of banking, banks had the power. But, somehow, amazingly, some random guy gave the world a tool that has a possibly small, but legitimate chance of changing the game.

Who are you calling gullible?!? Seriously though, this is an interesting pov, I'm not sure if I agree with the "very afraid," but the "asset being pitched" is almost profound.

I have never given Beck enough thought to see if he had commented on The Creature. Like or not, believe it or not, that book changes the game. By offering an alternative  point of view that that, if you honestly consider (believe or not believe), really fucks your world up view.

I'd give you an upvote for the comment, but since you only get one it's for the username.

That's a totally fair point, the convo struck me as basically people who liked it but didn't understand it, which probably way ahead of where most of the population is. But isn't that number crunching essentially updating the blockchain? I'm fuzzy on this too. If only god made bitcoins, everything would be so much easier.

The most interesting thing is that for the "right wing, small gov't" worldview bitcoin is a no brainer - even on the giant "evil" corporation front, how much could they save in bank fees? When I see Krugman rail agaisnt bitcoin, it proves who's pocket he is in.

How do you generally weed through the forest of podcasts? i have trouble finding quality ones...
Thanks for the list it's a great start!

I agree that some things should not be run for profit and that a 3rd party be designated to find the best solution, not the most profitable. Defining that 3rd party as elite might be how they view it, however I thought the keynesian idea (ideally) is they should just be objective. As you say though, best is subjective.
As it is, the size of gov't in the U.S. these days is insane. It absolutely needs a lot of fat trimmed. But government also shouldn't run, or be held to the standards of a for profit company. They should be fiscally responsible and accountable, but war shouldn't be waged for profit, bridge safety and general infrastructure shouldn't be based on which is the cheapest or which generates the most cash. Healthcare shouldn't be about money it should be about health. 
All that seems like a pipedream in the U.S.

That should really be the headline "Glen Beck is more correct on bitcoin than ANYTHING ELSE, EVER"
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:13:53
That's actually pretty insightful...I'm just too cynical.
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:50:37
Makes you wonder if they're not already working on it.  They aren't stupid, their job is to maximize profits. Can they profit more from the status quo or can they hold the reins of bitcoin long enough to fix the market? I still don't know why Goldman Sachs hasn't just bought 52% out of spite.

A fanatic of anything is umm a fanatic...so you're not wrong, just the bitcoin association is superfluous

I put in a link. I'm pretty sure it was in the first half of the second hour. I was driving and NPR was especially boring, so I swiched only to hear about bitcoin. It was cringeworthy, but he didn't say anything that was really negative...also ended up talking about god and stuff.. I dunno, he's a wacky guy...
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:47:22
Actually, since this was posted I received a PM from the Glen Beck team. After some discussion we exchanged contact info and Glen called me, and    after a long conversation about bitcoins and the illuminati, he offered me a job that pays in bitcoin. All I have to do is tell him my opinion so he can regurgitate it on air while giving me no credit.  Little does he know I will feed him insane right wing propaganda just to make him look stupid....hahahaha jokes on him!!!
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:12:24
Seriously though, this is the real question...My dedication to the bitcoin cause overcame the shame of admiting that when NPR gets just too boring for me I switch to talk radio when driving. Then I usually just decide that listening to nothing is better than that, but this time bitcoin came up and I felt obligated.

Thank for a simple reply. I feel like the generic white guy walking into the hood and just shouting "Does anybody have any crack? I brought cash"

Yeah, I get that, I was just trying to get to the point. I don't quite understand why credit cards or paypal have more fraud risk than the bank account that listed on every check I write. I'm not unwilling to give info, I just want to be sure who I'm giving info to. I would hate to be at (made up site) bitcoinsgallore.com and give them $500 only to find out some random person in Peru (no offense Peru!) owns the domain and has no access to bitcoins at all. I'm totally green at this, and that may not be possible to happen. But being so new, I don't really know how it works yet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:52:01
I tried to buy but the Mt.Gox lag prevented me! - I have mixed feelings about that...

Couldn't they have used a differnet picture? A little more umm..professional?

Crazy, I had the exact same mindset and *tried* to buy a bitcoin off e-bay while trying to get accounts figured out and the seller said they sent the coin, it never showed and they refunded my money. Then the price crashed and realized how lucky I was. I still want to participate, but am 4980 in line to be verified...
