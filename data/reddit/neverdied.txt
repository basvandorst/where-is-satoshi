its funny that people only remember the good times and not the bad times. Remember those people who went into banckruptcies and closeouts of their houses because the economy tanked? I wonder if you were telling them to also "Hodl" as well.
Before being a wise ass you should realize that not everybody can wait for a market they invested their savings in to rebound $9000

you didn t read their fucking post did you? Transactions are too long and fees are too high. Sell something for $200 and when the transaction go through its worth $165...not worth it when you have to guarantee prices.
The bitcoin services/exchanges need to fix the fucking mess of slow transactions and high fees. Fuck you COinbase
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:18:41
YOU expect it? Who are you and why should people still keep losing money if they bought in the 1800s? The only reason the HODL meme is there is because people don t want to take a loss themselves and want others to not sell...it's a selfish meme but sometimes you have to deal with reality

Personally one of my number one rules in life is to NEVER EVER do business with any company that does not have a support phone number or an office I can easily go to.
This is why I don t deal with Uber. Any company that only use email can go F themselves because of problems just like this one where there is nothing you can do while someone churns the money
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:48:59
I SWEAR these assholes at Coinbase are pulling a Paypal and simply locking accounts so they can CHURN the money while you wait. This should not be legal...I can not believe people still use them. I boycotted Paypal long ago because of this, so looks like I am never ever using Coinbase ever

@_date: 2018-01-18 23:59:29
I don t think they are stealing I think they are pulling a Paypal and churning the money before you get it. 
On another note NOBODY should do ANY business with a company that does not provide a means for people to call or inquire about product or service. Uber does this and they are a shitty company. 
I would rather spent money than having to deal with companies like these ESPECIALLY Coinbase that has a very shitty image at the moment

This is how Paypal was growing when they started freezing funds for long periods of time. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:36:09
If this is not herd mentality I don t know what it is. If you lost more than 50% of the value of the money invested then you need to talk to someone about making good decisions in your life.
If you shorted then happy days for you but you people who meme others to hold their losses is not helping. Some people have invested their college funds and life savings and risk way more than the little amounts you are investing.
Nobody who has lost more than 10k is laughing and fist pumping that they are holding their losses.
It is like someone not being able to make payments on a mortgage because they invested everything in crypto only to lose half of their money being told "hey its ok and here is this meme in the meantime lolololo" You are not helping
If you are genuinely holding your loss then posthow much you have invested because someone with $100 mean dick. Now if you took 20k loss then that s another thing...be adults for a while

He is right BUT also wrong because he thinks about crypto as an investment when it shouldn t. The point of bitcoin is to be able to make payments and transcations without a middle man and the government watching over you.
I wouldn t recommend to invest in bitcoin but I would recommend to buy some to do transactions outside of the VISA/MASTERCARD/BANKING network.
Bitcoin is not for trading or investment...leave that to professionals. Bitcoin should be about making payments on anything anywhere around the world without currency change/manipulation and banking fees

This is a long term investment...NOT a make money quick tool. It does not matter what the value is right now what matters is what it will be worth in a couple of years.
Because of the increase in interest it is virtually guaranteed that prices of digital currencies will keep increasing as more and more services accept payments in those currencies.
Unless your investment is timed and you need to get out in a couple of months or something then you should not worry because demand always increases with Bitcoin as more people get in the craze. Also the other advises as "Only invest what you are willing to lose" are correct. You need to weight what your goals are and I don t think anybody here can help you with this.

That has to be the most retarded comeback that I have ever seen. Does your job pay you in Gold or Silver coins? 
Again, until you can go to the grocery store or ANY store in a walking distance ANYWHERE in the world then it is worth shit. It is a virtual crypto currency. The anonymity part was a cool idea but there is no point to it because it is not fungible and you can not remain anonymous to buy and then sell and cash it out at a local bank or store BECAUSE it is not backed by anything and as seen in the 300% change in 10 days it is retarded

Its not about luck its about incompetence
Just think about this if the market was constantly going up. Companies like Coinbase act like Paypal used to act like: Being assholes and churning your money while you wait. I can t wait for them to be replaced by a better solution
EDIT: not that Paypal are not assholes anymore...they still are just like Ticketmaster and Comcast or EA

Its not bad news FFS its simple technical analysis going to the support. Now it either will break it and all hell will shit down or it holds and slowly goes back above 10k.

First you should not use Paypal
Second, Paypal is well known to scam people by freezing the money in accounts for 180 days while the money is being used to buy short term bonds and churn the interest rates.
This is their business model. There are thousands of stories of people constantly having their accounts frozen for long periods of time.
Here is what you need to do: NEVER EVER use your main bank account. Create a second bank account and use that one the wire from that account to your main bank. DO NOT give Paypal access to that account. When you have something in Paypal transfer it asap to that second account then wire it to the other account so that paypal can not charge back or withdraw the money later.
Paypal is an awful company and you should not be doing business with them. There are other options than Paypal. When you choose convenience you risk losing your donations
As for the guy in the article I don t care about him I just wanted to comment on Paypal practices
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:02:50
Its normal...you don t want people to have massive credit card debts and not be able to pay them. The banks are fine with people using debit cards because DON T SPEND MONEY YOU DON T HAVE
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:11:02
I mean seriously
First the count stops around 130+
Second the transactions at the bottom are obviously NOT transactions sent for the promotion but just the current BT trades going through
Third, name one business that gives you 10 times the amount you give it instantly?
Fourth if you have things to give like money, do you give it to people who already have money and do you ask them to give you money to prove you have money in the first place?
I could go on and on about how many massive red flags there are there 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:54:29
Technical correction. The support is around 7772 for today if it breaks below it then it will not be pretty.
There is no real reason why this is happening besides this follow technical analysis. People want and need to find reasons why a market goes up or down...technical analysis never lies nor care and since every trader on the planet follows technical analisis it is like a self fulfilling prophecy
Also watch the stock market...its it dives everything else dives
Edit: most people here are not traders and don t understand trading. I have traded futures and option for a large bank for 20 years...trust me this has everything to do with hitting supports and going through. You should be investing for the long run NOT the short run. 
BTC needs to stabilize and stay around a value and not rise or fall like it has since last year because this is not sustainable
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:08:21
Next support 5600

Futures are a mean to cover you now for the price in the future. It dates from more than 2000 years ago when farmers would sell their crop 6 month before growing them to cover in case of bad weather and the buyer would guarantee that they would receive a crop in the future.
Futures are for people who need to cover themselves in the commodity/currency/product and for also speculating. Options are even more interesting
The answer is because it provides the exchange (CME) with another product to sell and make money on
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:19:29

BTC should NOT be an investment. It should be a means to buy and sell without having to use banks and credit cards... it should simply be the online currency it needs to be. The speculation is the problem giving all these massive debts people are getting into.
I love the idea of paying things in bitcoin and receiving bitcoins for sales on ebay for example but I can not stand the idea of speculating and investing on something that is so volatile. For Bitcoin to work I feel it needs to be stable and not be used as a speculation tool
