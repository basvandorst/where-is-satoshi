You guy's are too kind! Please PM me a mailing address or email address so my boys can send you a thank you.
LOL maybe I need to show them how to make LemonaidCoin so they can issue you store credit.

Several people did! I showed them the wallet this morning and they were jumping around all excited. I'm going to have them send out thank you's shortly.

LOL that's my wife's fault! She said it was spelled "lemon" + "aid" and my son just followed directions.

Thank you so much! I will have them send you a thank you.

My oldest asked me about it, so I did the conversion for him and printed the QR code... no one paid in BTC though lol.
I wanted to share it with the community since I thought it was pretty funny.

I showed my oldest the wallet last night and he got super excited. Should be enough to cover college in eleven years!

Looks a bit tired but still never misses a beat.

 it's a corner, i was standing in the cross street to take the picture.

Thank you!

:-) Probably not lemonade but I could have them make you a thank you card and a craft of some type. Was just posting the pic because I thought it was funny.

Lol for the record my wife told them how to spell it. The btc was a fun add because my son had been asking about it... also, they would probably like the idea of doge better simple because it has a dog on the logo.

lol Sorry I think you guys are reading too much into it. I just posted the picture because I thought it was funny. My son is 7 and has been asking about bitcoin because I work in the industry and he hears me talking about it all the time.
