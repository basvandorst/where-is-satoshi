Unfortunately, some states don't acknowledge the difference between skill-based and chance-based gaming (gaming as in "gambling," as it relates to state laws)
@_date: 2015-06-17 01:58:38
I've seen multiple trailers, and though there is drug dealing, I've not heard a single mention of bitcoin in the movie. I didn't even make that connection until just now. To me it was just a cool looking movie, and I thought it was cool I could buy the ticket with bitcoin, because I was actually planning to see it ever since sundance
@_date: 2015-06-03 06:57:07
I know the guys behind it personally. 100% legit.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:42:15
there's plenty of space in the world to hide stuff dude, not just your own house…I hardly see this as a reason to abstain from buying gold if you really want to invest
@_date: 2015-06-03 06:46:32
I have a pretty simple system. I always buy bitcoin when I run out.

They accept bitcoin but have never heard of reddit lol
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:58:14
There's this powerful technology, you know. It's called hiding things.

Regardless of OP's intent (which I disagree with you about), it perpetuates this stupid, unnecessary, misguided "rivalry," which has no reason to exist in the first place.
@_date: 2014-06-14 07:52:31
There is a lot of irony in not being able to install a bitcoin wallet *because* you're jailbroken.

Wow that's awesome, because I was thinking the same thing…though maybe a little more politely worded. Keep up the awesome work guys. I'm so excited.

Yeah, I've actually generated my own before. I'm talking about how at the top of the page, it actually says “EZTV”.
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:35:42
Cool, but the proper term is “address,” not “wallet.”
Address is a part of bitcoin—wallet is a third-party software, usually to make bitcoin more convenient.
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:45:41
Just because you like how it looks when you look at the data a certain way doesn't mean anything. It's arbitrary.
@_date: 2014-09-23 11:48:33

@_date: 2014-05-26 05:49:12
I would kill to have a native, redesigned Blockchain app on iOS. I hope they're working on it.

I've always thought Uber is the perfect type of service to use bitcoin with. Because it's like, you fill up your account w/ money and then use it like it were fuel.

Not any more than we "know" that they are allowing bitcoin wallets on iOS…
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:10:58
CoinJar isn't in the US, and Blockchain isn't back yet. So far, my fave iOS wallet is Coin Pocket, but an improved Blockchain app will def beat it.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:04:59
Oh, yeah. You're right. You get my point though.
And Blockchain is really the only service that I trust with my money right now.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:37:41
This is cool, but don't forget that we're still trying to unleash 51-percent-proof verifications without generating confirmed hash rates. We're not fucking around in this subreddit, so if you're not engaging anonymous genesis blocks with hard-fork private wallets, gtfo please.

@_date: 2014-05-15 06:15:31
Real question: what is the advantage of doing a game-specific coin, vs just using Bitcoin? Speed? Or what? Because the way I see it, if you just used BTC in Eve, then it would be easier to immediately understand the actual value of a price in-game than if you had to convert Evecoin to BTC.

@_date: 2014-07-05 20:47:23
Bitcoin's value is in its utility as a payments network. I don't see how that "matters little."
@_date: 2014-06-08 22:31:29
Yeah I know that. I'm not talking about the address itself. I'm talking about how on the page it says “EZTV”. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 08:25:33
my whole point is that they don't have to "support bitcoin" at all…they support NFC, and bitcoin uses it
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:23:59
digital* currency
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:38:27
Bear in mind that CoinJar used shared addresses, or something like that. Basically, the address you send from is not the same address you receive to.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:26:44
no, it could require you to be logged in, an then it remembers it on your account
@_date: 2014-09-10 08:25:57
how does apple get their cut from a QR code bitcoin app?
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:53:18

Percentage-wise, I'd guess Dogecoin has more positive press. But as for the actual amount of press, I'd say it's certainly Bitcoin. But yeah those numbers would be cool to see.

they don't have to reach out to anyone in order to use bitcoin or use coinbase
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:21:45
Because they don't even allow any alternate payment methods at all in-app. Like, this is probably not even supposed to be allowed in the app. And they don't deal in bitcoin in any way.
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:58:16

It's annoying to me only because I know that a lot of people probably perceive it as trolling (because they—understandably—don't know anything about Dogecoin), rather than the genuine request that it actually is. The Doge community could definitely be a little more aware of that perception, but also to an extent you can't help the way you are perceived.
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:10:24

You sure about that?
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:15:28
In a sense, your point is reasonable, but also keep in mind that bitcoin is a currency and a payments solution all in one. Credit cards are basically a payments solution too. So there is overlap.
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:47:47
Are you sure you know what that word means
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:42:55
Completely agree. It's like when some gets upset when you ask them for the "source" of their claim. Or when people say "Not that I don't trust you…but source?" It's like…umm you don't have to qualify that request for a source with shit. Why *would* you intrinsically trust this person?
@_date: 2014-05-07 05:18:24
In fact, there is no official statement on it at all, but people like to speculate, and believe what they want…there is no reason that it couldn't change in the future, when bitcoin is too big to ignore.
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:39:00
I get that, but he didn't pay on the merchant's terms…what if he didn't want to sell that pumpkin, or changed his price, or didn't want to sell to him? It's not up to you, it's up to the merchant…you're not entitled to their stuff just because you want it. Or even the most obvious point…what if he didn't want to accept bitcoin? Not up to you.

IMO, the only reason they were so hesitant is that they are a huge company, and were simply trying to be conservative, legally speaking. Wanted to make sure they understood it before they made a decision. Then, WWDC (when iOS 8 was announced) was simply a nice time and place to make some changes, since a lot of big shit happened all at once anyways. Just was a convenient and appropriate time.

@_date: 2014-05-28 23:40:02
That's great, but just fyi Silk Road is considered one of the less trusted darknet markets. It just happens to be popular because of all of the media coverage it's gotten.
@_date: 2014-06-01 05:02:30
If you are going to legit do something like this, it would be way more productive to just simply have it be a price ticker, and maybe a URL where people can learn more about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:22:44

I'm *not* saying I support this guy's actions in any way. At all. Total piece of shit, even if he never does any of the things listed. But it is kind of clever idea to just make a shitload of these and place them on various businesses and see if anyone bites.

You don't think "twerk" should be considered a word?

Yep. But the way you interpret them can be either irrational or rational. I have yet to hear why log is inherently more valid in any way than linear.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:09:10
Something I've noticed is that sometimes people will mention "paying with bitcoin" as if that, in and of itself, is a joke. Like, that's the joke. They think that just mentioning bitcoin is funny. I guess maybe it is to the average person?
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:03:34
Granted, it's ***technically*** not confirmed that third-party apps can access the NFC, but that's just as much speculation as anything anyone else is saying…and I mean why wouldn't they be allowed to when they can now access Touch ID in iOS 8, you know?
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:50:37

@_date: 2014-05-11 22:13:10
I know, right? I love how doge has become a legitimate symbol of everything Dogecoin represents over the course of Dogecoin's journey, as opposed to just a silly meme. I mean, it's still a silly meme, but the two aren't mutually exclusive.
It's legitimately becoming its own thing, and I just think that is *so* fucking cool.
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:23:09

The appropriate place for your theory is in the comments. I get why you didn't put your theory in the post, but stop being all weird about it.
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:41:11
it could just be delayed in the US, or for some other reason. Who knows. They are all separate stores.
@_date: 2014-07-31 09:36:51
yeah people use it all the time
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:44:55
why did you put bitcoin in quotes
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:54:03
Any practical joke that carries consequence, or a joke whose "punchline" is a literal truth. Also, our existence.
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:50:55
Yeah I do think it's a good day because of this. I'm not really sure that I understand your point (or if you are even trying to make a point), to be honest.
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:00:43
Mixed feelings about this. But w/e, probs net positive. Cool either way.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:35:24
Wrong word…

@_date: 2015-05-30 04:15:05
don't worry people still can, and will always be able (as long as bitcoin exists), to do that

Congratulations, judge! You:
* Ruined a man's life.
* That's it. That's all you achieved here.

I didn't say he was a saint, I said that was all that was accomplished by putting him away for life.

The thing about this is that Apple Pay has NOTHING to do with bitcoin. What ***does*** to do with bitcoin is NFC inclusion in iPhone 6. If NFC is accessible to third party apps on iPhone 6, then bitcoin wallets can use it. End of story. Apple Pay doesn't have to include it, nor is it obligated to. basically, today is awesome news, as it will popularize NFC and enable NFC in more bitcoin wallets, and typical is trying to turn it into a war.
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:52:16
It doesn't even have to be…they just need to open up the iphone's NFC to developers, like they eventually did with touch ID, and then developers and stuff can make their own solutions

Are you implying facebook isn't useful or successful? Not sure what you are trying to say.
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:49:50
Care to elaborate on how you arrived at these numbers? I'm not saying they are wrong but they are certainly surprising to me if they are true.
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:25:28

Alternate to their own payments system. On iOS, you have to do IAPs through a credit card or whatever that's registered to your Apple ID. ([Source](


Apple isn't doing that. Whoever developed the app is, and they're getting away with it for who knows how long.

lol. I was just wondering where the gif came from. I figure it was probably in a Hive newsletter or something because I couldn't find it on your twitter or your website.

log scales can be equally accused of being cherry picking…i've yet to hear a reason that log scales are somehow more valid

Technically, it *is* still the case until Circle actually exists.
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:07:05
Technically yeah, I'm assuming that, but why wouldn't they? It's just another way of communicating with another device, just like wifi, QR, cellular, or bluetooth. Third-party apps now even have access to Touch ID in iOS 8, and it's not like there is any risk or sensitive data involved in allowing an app to use the NFC controller.

Coinbase app is pretty rad actually IMO, what don't you like about it?

This is not how you contact coinbase

I already do buy things with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2015-07-27 04:43:19
How does the "fee" factor into that equation? Seems like the math is off, yeah?
@_date: 2015-09-26 05:55:43
or what seems like the obvious solution to me: allow them to have a little wallet on the service's site that they can load up when they feel like it, and charge that wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:28:57


Why would you assume that would downvote you for wanting to pay for porn in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-06 20:39:06
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:40:25
Just to be clear, you aren't shitting on Coinbase/Circle, right? Obviously they specifically aren't trying to kill BTC. They are just doing things that are in their own interest by following crazy laws.
@_date: 2015-11-17 22:01:01
What kind of feedback are you looking for

past life memory retention may not be a part of typical reincarnation belief but there are many cases of people reporting this having happened

it works very well
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:33:17
what does this even mean
@_date: 2015-03-08 08:06:06
no one can answer this question.
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:56:52
I think it's just more of a proof of concept…
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:08:03
wait, are you telling me that bitcoin is faster than fiat?
@_date: 2015-03-08 08:01:25
yeah the whole thing is very vague and weird
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:44:15
it kind of is the truth…any kind of money is constantly stolen lol
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:13:56
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:39:56
I would guess that they actually have been working very hard.
