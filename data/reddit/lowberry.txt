binance doesn't allow fiat buys does it? Also, does kraken let you use debit card or buy coins instantly? ill check it out
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:47:52
Some silly mistake. They are claiming I owe $1,000 or so, and I really have no idea how it happened. They have been glitching with me a lot lately.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:18:12
Like the bank teller? 
But The charges did not show up at all. I mean some did, but the ones theyre saying I owe, they did not show up on my statement. Theyre trying to make me pay off the $1370 before I'm allowed to trade again. I had no idea I spent that much, because I was looking at my bank statement, and it would show that I had money.
As of now I don't have that amount in my bank account anyways. I thought I was spending money I had.
I was just wondering if this happened to anyone else. I guess ill just contact CB
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:03:44
I did check, its been a few hours, and its still not showing up on blockchain. This isn't normal, is it? Again btc address I was trying to transfer to: 1wJMigGFPuSUHzoPvtkbzvwTZ4oynm7nC  amt: 0.028
Its only showing my old transactions, nothing about this one. I think something is wrong. Like a glitch with coinbase or something
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:53:04
Sort've..... I mean, the BTC and ETH showed on my coinbase wallet, and after I sent them, they disappeared. So im not completely sure whats going on, is this perhaps some glitch, or just maybe a regular delay?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:17:57
I have $60 worth of amazon gift cards, where is the best place I can exchange it for btc or (preferably) eth or ltc?
Is paxful my only option? their rates are kinda high.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:23:24
The thing is, my balance is not negative, and the charges coinbase claims I owe never showed up on my bank statement
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:08:14
half an hour, lol you're just getting started, its been like 6 hours for me
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:23:03
So......... where can one buy bitcoins in jordan
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:47:40
What are some good exchanges with decent fees, and a quick verification process?
Coinbase froze my acct., and gemini I have been waiting a month for verification. tried some others, and also taking forever to verify.
Any suggestions?
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:45:52
Yea thats what I was thinking. let him paypal me and ill buy for him. I don't think theres a huge demand over there for buying btc though.
But im currently having problems myself, coinbase froze my acct, gemini won't verify me. tried some other exchanges and they are all giving me trouble with the verification process. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:49:55
I have an acct with them and use them to transfer, but I can't figure out how to buy, and also because they are not instant I believe? (or are they?)
Just tried buying coins off them, it doesn't give me an option for which payment method I want to use, and it said 'insufficient funds'. not sure what im doing wrong
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:58:08
Im working on it. Which one do you suggest? I signed up for gemini a week ago and uploaded my id, but its been 6 days and they are still verifying my identity.... Any other ones where you can buy coins instantly?
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:53:21
Lol, Im not even sure if I did though, because coinbase froze my purchasing ability, and they froze $300 worth of BTC I have in my account, until I pay them the $1370, and I'd really like to be able to use them again and I dont want this to get reported on my credit. But I did buy alts with most of the coins that I did manage to move off.
Lol free. I wish they would just let me off the hook. Im only posting this again to ask if it happened to anyone else, because im genuinely curious what is going on
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:17:33
I know it can take hours to actually receive, but isn't the transaction supposed to atleast show up by now on the blockchain explorer? something seems odd. I have a feeling it just didn't go through at all
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:24:24
There are only 2 sellers and they are selling wayyyy above market price, like $12k or so
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:03
damn, so who exactly is behind this
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:37
no, owner of bitcoin.com
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:11:53
Pretty now they can buy the candy store
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:27
oh, i was looking at coinbase, why do they have it wrong
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:13
and why is gdax doing this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:32
Wow, thats some shady shit. I just got a pm from someone saying "Bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin. You have been duped. Go learn at r/btc"
Wtf, so are all these shills paid to spread this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:26


what is fomo? ive seen it being used here multiple times, but have no idea what it means, fear of mising out?
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:31:25
Im sorry Im not up to date with the whole bitcoin thing, havent bought em in months, you mean through localbitcoin? or through other means? and Build confidence? is that like a feature on localbitcoins or do you mean actual Confidence? sorry im really confused right now! last time I bought btc was like a year ago. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:55:22
unfortunately noone selling personally where I live. but yea thats what it seems like, and I guess my only option is western union, as chase doesnt do the cash deposits anymore and thats the only bank around here on localbtc. I guess im just gona go with a western union payment, Im just surprised at how high the prices are on localbtc now, almost 100$ over bitcoin price. sucks
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:33:15
What is the quickest way to buy kinda small amounts of BTC 50-200$?
I used to use bitinstant via moneygram - they shut down
then used to use LocalBTC, via chase deposit, apparently chase stopped allowing you to deposit into other peoples accounts
Still looking like its gonna be localbtc maybe thru western union or vanilla reload card, chase is the only bank they have locally for me... Needs the coins within hours and hopefully not too expensive.... localbtc seems to charge mostly 100$ above btc price
I dont have a bank account with $ in it or a credit/debit card with $ on it.
is this my best option given my situation? Please help
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:20:24
The address is same as the one on card. Is it possibly because the credit card is in a family members name?
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:01:32
hey do you know if I can buy btc on virwox? I know you can buy SLL then exchange it, looking for a place with instant credit card purchases
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:32:38
Ah, ok, I see it now. Have you used them before? And why do you suggest them? There are quite a few offering to do this, but im not sure whos the best to go with. 


Cant work with this. damnit
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:13:14
Nope, that appears to be just for trading? I want to buy with a credit card, i dont see that option?
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:20:02
Where would you go if you had one choice?
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:56:06
why cant we just check something to make the payment irreversible
So anyways, is there anywhere I can buy about 300$ worth instantly without waiting days for verification?
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:48:30
Yes there are, But I was hoping to buy them from the comfort of my bedroom, and the ATMS in my area charge like a 10-12% fee which is crazy. Does noone sell btc for credit card anymore? 
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:26:19
He may have been looking back. now that I remember, he kept asking me to add him on skype and wouldnt do the trade through pm
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:26:35
How the hell do you know my name.
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:38:29
I'd prefer bitcoin accept amazon.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:52:46
Probably not, but it will take a quite a while to get an ROI, and I doubt I can start anything with the $200 I have to my name. You did inspire me, atleast :)
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:54:15




Im actually not. Im extremely depressed, and haven't been able to feel happiness or pleasure for years. I dont even know why I posted the dumb smiley, just being cordial, I guess. Can you help me, Doggobot?
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:44:46
I would give you gold. but I am broke and in debt. thanks for sharing this
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:39:30
I just wish I held on to some of them. I should stop dwelling
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:27:41
Nope. I've been suffering from severe depression for the past few years, haven't been able to hold a steady job, and sold whatever I had at a loss, because I needed the money. fml
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:26:34
I know, I know, It does require a decent investment, and I only have $200 to my name that is probably gonna be going to medical bills. But I guess any investment I can make counts
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:06:41
Just logged in to that forum after a few years and found that.... Jesus if only I knew what they'd be worth today. 
Hey, maybe he's still selling them, you never know right?
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:51:24
interesting, well check it out for sure
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:45:57
I tend to dwell on the past a lot and don't notice it. Just something that comes along with my mental illness.
No but seriously, wtf was wrong with us
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:26:08
Not whining. I just logged in after a few years and saw that, and thought it was funny, given how things turned out.
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:44:04
How much $ have you made on mining over your mining career in total? I know its a long shot, but figured I'd ask
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:25:38
Awesome. And for the record, I believe you, and I think you are a great person for sharing this and encouraging people to mine. It's inspiring. I wish I could get into mining, but I have nothing to invest and I feel like it is getting too late as it gets harder everyday.
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:16:34
lol I wonder if he will ever get back on and see my message, he was active in feb 2017 so theres hope
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:12:06
Can you post some pictures, obviously dont have to reveal everything, but I really wanna see what this looks like
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:27:29
Hey, maybe he's still selling them, I responded to him asking if theyre still for sale
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:29:47
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:29:39
tell me about it. years ago, when bitcoin was new, i remember buying them at $9.... then spending them, had no interest investing. Later on as they went up, bought some at $40, freaked out, and sold em off at a loss. I could've been a millionaire. But here I am, broke. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:31:49
I used to buy bitcoins years ago when they were still new, I remember buying at $9.... and then spending them like an idiot. Later they went up to $40, I figured I'd buy some, price dropped below $40, freaked out and sold them. So frustrating now buying them at 2800, if only I knew back then. I bet there are tons of people like me
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:19:51
Any chance it will go down in the next few years or fall out? lol stupid question I know
