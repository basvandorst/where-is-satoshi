Congrats, dude! Now get yourself a nice sharp pencil and write that fucker down onto paper.
No, but seriously, truecrypt it and store it in any cloud you can find. Send it to your gmail account. Send it to friends/relatives for safekeeping. Whatever. Just don't keep it on just one disk!

Candle wax rules. So many security systems that are used today are much less secure than candle wax and a unique-ish stamp (like a physical key or fingerprint)

"I got a hundred-dollar check from my grandma and my dad said I need to put it in MtGox so it can grow over the years."
"Well that's fantastic. A really smart decision, young man. We can make you an account, after you submit your ID you get to wait in the queue for a few weeks, then we'll reject your first attempt, accept you to keep your hopes up, freeze your account when you've gained a bit of profit aaaand.. it's gone. "

It seems that we're seeing this more and more often.. How realistic is it that a large authority or group is behind this, attempting to destabilise the Bitcoin network?
They seem to be going after the only part that's slightly centralised: the exchanges. Are they truly our Achilles' heel?
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:27:33
At the rate this is going, you'll soon have money for nothing and kicks for free!
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:14:36
Wait.. did you just..? What?
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:38:32
We're nowhere near 2billion in trades, though. A serious amount of that money is stored away on people's harddrives.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:29:19
Ah, you were an actual paying user. That changes things slightly, as you'd expect them to handle your stuff careful out of costumer support. I'm on a (&gt;20GB) free account, so anything they do I accept as a feature ;)
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:17:49
Or even upload a high-res screenshot somewhere.

@_date: 2013-04-07 14:28:01
As the last hour has shown, this had truth in it. The question remains if the coil has sprung, or if there's more coming up shortly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:42:01
Ouch, right in the unemployment!
@_date: 2013-04-27 08:44:38
With the hash rates these things should be getting, ints would hardly suffice.
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:37:58
Buying is the answer to everything. And then when everyone's buying..
..buy some more, since it's still rising!
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:10:12
Are you or are you not progressing already requested withdrawals from another account, as mentioned on the website? Is there a time estimate for this?
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:10:34
Are we even sure Mt. Gox isn't hosted /from/ North Korea? I mean, it's the textbook example of counter-imperialism, right? Right?
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:24:02
Ride the rollercoaster while it's still in business!

Thanks! Here's a slightly larger version, such that the entire article is a bit more legible:

They tweeted about it as well ( - it seems that their hosting provider made a bit of a mistake..
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:14:06
Nailed it. And the innuendo, too.
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:58:30
It may be worth noting that it's been a slow day all around. It was a saturday, too.

Cryptography is your friend, especially in the cloud. In any cloud, really.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:24:49
Nice try, GRU.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:16:06
They've [just tweeted again]( saying verified users can send an e-mail to support and get access via an 'alternate' URL.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:15:47
Right. I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:52:47
This is a great idea!
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:22:06
Would you guys please keep the price low while I'm waiting for Bitcoin Central to release my funds? Thanks, much appreciated.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:08:26
Any exchange I know accepts floating-point values without problems. Where have you tried?
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:31:04
Seems legit at first glance, the past work seems to check out.
Good job on accepting bitcoin! It's people like you that make it flourish.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:33:02
Did you just..? Wow, good job!
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:07:49
What about we transition the bottom one to the left by one month? Chop off December and add June? Gives a whole new perspective on things.
Charts make you see what you want to see.

Do you realise that when you write ΓΛCΣΒΘΘΚ, it's not pronounced Facebook, but rather 'Glcsbtʰtʰk'? Not to mention 'Fpstlgrlm'..
@_date: 2013-04-06 15:40:08
That's not true. Sure, a little decrease in power would not immediately destroy the security, but it would make the chance of a break bigger. Bitcoin is a percentage game. As long as the 'good nodes' invest a lot of computational power, any 'bad nodes' would have to spend a lot as well. This makes attacking the network really hard. If good nodes would slack, an attacker would have a much higher chance of succesfully adding bogus transactions to blocks and getting them embedded into the chain.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:00:29
Exactly. 10 seems quite low, considering  the current pooling spread.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:26:42
Oh, by the way, developers got theirs slightly earlier: 
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:25:50
Some people just want to watch the world *earn*.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:19:16
'Priceless' would be the only way to describe it, yeah.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:17:27
You're correct on that point. But then again, anyone doing any encryption but yourself should be assumed to (be able to) decrypt it again at their convenience.
Keep your friends (or apps) close, but your keys closer.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:15:00
A coin is only as strong as its support. It has taken quite a while for Bitcoin to gain the amount of following it has now, and it won't be easy for a competing coin to fish the same pool. Litecoin (amongst [many others]( is trying, but hardly succesful.
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:26:15
Upvoted for education.
@_date: 2013-04-27 08:43:09
Maybe not. To observe is to decide.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:01:00
To anyone giving an estimate / reasoned explaination: minus 10 points.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:19:10
A slight lag, and this plan foils. Probably feels even worse if it was on purpose, and it failed ;)
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:08:58
With current fuel prices as they are, a 92km drive does not profit

Or AAPL stock when Steve was gone.

We've seen doubling figures before. Just.. not in this order of magnitude ;)

As long as it does in fact, not kill you.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:16:05
Same, same. I hoped to find one with a larger font, but apparently this is the best Google had to offer. Oh well, it'll have to do.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:59:29
Seconded. I'd like to know this as well.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:53:57
If they have not implemented it by then - yes. Definitely a good idea!
@_date: 2013-03-24 08:44:10
Wow, these guys are well on their way!
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:42:39
Ah, that settles it then!
@_date: 2013-04-07 08:44:24
This is quite an important factor. Since BTC Guild has now proven its honours by explicitly preventing 51% (even though it's a mental barrier), other large pools will be inclined to follow suit when they approach a similar size.
@_date: 2013-03-24 12:53:09
I can wholeheartedly agree. It's a great experience and it really gives us Math/CS people a reason to submerge in the non-exact world of economics. Even when we only end up making a few bucks.
It's not about the destination, it's all about the ride.
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:57:46
So far it's mainly MtgoxUSD and MtgoxEUR that are of any significance. If you feel like it you can look up MtgoxGBP in the list, but that hardly influences their percentage.

For those unfamiliar with the Stack Exchange network: it's the network behind [stackoverflow]( and it has a diverse spread of websites based on the same Q&amp;A concept. The community is always awesome and willing to help - arguably, their rep system is quite as addictive as reddit karma.

So... buy new paper. You need something only you can restore/create.
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:15:39
That's a great setup. And at the rate it's going at the moment, you're basically earning a load of money by buying stuff.
