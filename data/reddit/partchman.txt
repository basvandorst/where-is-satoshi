Why isn't one of them Chinese?

Here is my 1st attempt.  I will adapt with larger frames as currencies inflate and fail.

It won’t fail

I’m collecting a few hyperinflation notes to do something similar.  I’m planning on having the white paper as the background. ©️��

A better question might be “At what price are you planning to sell your Bitcoin “?

I’d like to know how many of what was lost...

Verge, XVG, still is leaving me wondering.  I know that their teams are progressing. The long play but their tech looks good.

That’s the scariest thing I’ve ever seen.

I watched it. I’m glad they still have blinders on. Although I am saying this for a purely selfish motive.  I’d like to have more time to buy at a discount while wallstreet stalls and lies to itself and its investors.  Looking to get 21!

If you peg an amount, you need to have a date for measurement and some factors of consideration.

Yep, it's an undone page.   
Not guilty

I actually will do the same thing. Will the miners choose by voting to increase the cap?

A link to the article would help

I used jaxx/shapeshift to move BTC to ETH.  They had a 2 BTC max.  Is there a service that will do 20 at a time or should I use an exchange.   If so, what’s the best exchange?

I’m with you. Still waiting for my transaction to be confirmed.

Watched for 3 minutes before I looked how long it was..... 3
