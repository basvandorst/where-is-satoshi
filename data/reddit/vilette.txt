talking about a sale in bitcoin
and all i see is $
@_date: 2014-09-05 22:07:00
crytocurrencies ?

To know what can go wrong, read Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:58:28
did i read "failing cheap" ?
@_date: 2014-03-20 01:03:20
When dealing with money, encrypting the transaction is only a part of the problem, and bitcoins "operators" have really no experience in dealing with all the other problems about security, like social engineering for example.

this is a server farm, not bitcoin mining.
Mining move to China, where tech startups have free electricity 
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:02:17
some days yes, some-days no

i just found a better mining algorithm, the idea is to use some new findings in [galois theory]( actually it's running on my laptop.
Wait until i adapt the code for a GPU, i hope it won't break the 50% limit 
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:13:28
it is not real money.
If you buy a ticket for a roller coaster ride,yes you use real money to buy it, but the ride itself is not real money.
And there is no refund if you didn't like it.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:41:26
that's sound good, 
but with real-time, it is fun to make tens of very small transactions a day and i don't know anything below 0.5%.
Anyway, the question is more about people testimonials about using software for automatic intraday trading on btc
@_date: 2014-08-16 18:36:05
I did visit your web-shop, but all the prices are $ ?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:53:48

this is the best strategy to get as few as possible complaints.
A few guys with a lot of coins who could get very angry, -&gt; fixed ok
A crowd of guys with a small amount, but they make the buzz, fixed ok
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:02:47
I generally dislike when people post log charts when they should use linear scale
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:06:55
No android version ?
I hate ios
@_date: 2014-08-14 09:41:19
hash rate is so high, those bitcoins need to be sold ?
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:04:32


I like that, please do it now
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:09:26
But first Bitcoin needs to absorb all the other coins
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:14:43
a lot of the site that advertise "we accept bitcoin"  are just everything in $, and when you are ready to pay, they propose an amount in btc that must be calculated at that time
Have you a link to a list of websites that show the prices in btc ?
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:18:25
5% !!!!!
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:07:51
do you know the meaning of robert in french, specially when there are [2]( of them ?

1-online wallets
2-VC investors don't seek revenue, but a good exit plan

i do not think the computer power wasted in the exponentially growing mining process is something efficient
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:16:17
we are still far from some independent currency, 
seen like this, it looks like an nickname for $ or another paypal
@_date: 2014-03-22 23:35:55
WTF, belly dancer with glasses
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:08:04
so, they need to change the price nearly in real time and convert fast if they don't want to loose up to 20%.
I think of the poor guy who update his web-page selling used cars once every week
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:59:20
you mean [that fiat]( ?
who would ?
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:11:24
I see a lot of very high quality 3D renderings and photoshop here, but have you any real pictures of the car ?
As we can [see here]( your main job is graphic designer.
Very good work indeed, but the reflection of the horizon in the middle of the close-up of the wheel, perfectly sharp in a picture which looks like short depth of field is not belivable.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:22:22

If you had ever been on a "black" track, it is the exact same feeling

Another stupid tactic is to downvote every new without reading to make yours above
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:11:39
who cares about the past, nobody can go backward, everybody must go in the future and you will come with us
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:29:45
at what frequency do you update the volume to bitcoin value ?
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:06:13
"With the conclusion that bitcoin likely can’t work as a currency"
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:56:02
they are using reddit for search, with the submit a new text post button
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:07:42
 you can see the traderbots in action
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:23:37
Guys,too much porn affect your brain !

and [THIS]( is a vagina
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:18:57
why log scale ?
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:00:46
0.15BTC/day, 12TH/s.
That's more than 10KW of heat, what are you doing with it,warming the swimming pool ?
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:12:29
Same if you gave your bitcoin to MtGox
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:44:29

@_date: 2014-06-13 14:34:22
Sure !
I am the real one


@_date: 2014-02-21 02:19:19
there are only A FEW people (perhaps only one) selling  HUGE amounts of BTC on MTGox, 
I don't think he will read your advice.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:44:28
bots are traders too
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:11:28

if you change your mind, you can resell your ticket to someone on the waiting line.
But i agree the comparison is not flawless, when the ride is finished, you own nothing. That's not true for bitcoin, 
except for the few people who chose the broken track
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:01:53
the logic is simple, you can buy a hammer in any shop. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:50:58

@_date: 2015-05-16 23:44:26
They export gold and petroleum.


I'm not sure you sometimes read the news
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:22:52
why don't you buy a [0.5$ nfc tag]( and stick it on anything you like ? 
It is crazy that people paid 100 times this price to have it stick for them on a plastic ring.
@_date: 2015-05-30 13:55:18
comparing 2 words against one word is like comparing apple and pear ( to peer)

it is really easy, if you chose the country and make some deposit at first

And death in Russia,China, and a big part of the world
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:55:26
I do not exactly understand how this guy defines his "price-drops", 
and why not to take in account the volume which is totally unrelated to these announcements.

This is close to 1 transaction EVERY SECOND !
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:46:37
Bit Coins ?
@_date: 2015-03-27 02:07:01
soon, one bitcoin will be 10.000$,
so, 0.045BTC isn't that bad
