It's the same with gold?
I think using the term "store of effort" is better understood than "store of value".
A gold bar has value because we know that 1kg of gold took $50,000 of "effort" to produce.
Similarly, 1 BTC has value because we know that it took $4000 of "electricity" to produce.
It's just a representation of a finite resource.
In that respect it's not "wasteful" it's just a method to store effort.

The two "inputs" for cryptocurrency mining are the rig and electricity.
To me the rig is fairly close to optimum efficiency if we take BTC for example. The marginal benefit of the newest, greatest mining rig starts to diminish against the current best rigs.
Therefore in terms of profitability in mining it's a race for the cheapest electricity.
Whilst we're seeing cheap electricity in Iceland and large subsidies, in the end there's still a middleman.
To source cheap electricity, you basically have to manufacture it.
Which brings me to the point why don't power plants start mining cryptocurrency?
A power plant is on a microsecond level trying to achieve equilibrium between supply and demand. Over-supply means a power surge and under supply means a failure. In effect they are very rarely running at full capacity.
I would have thought that power plants should use any excess capacity and redirect it towards mining cryptocurrency.
They are in the best position to profit from it.

The way its written sounds like they didn't carry out the hack well.
Rather Binance confiscated the hacker's coins and donated it to charity.

Your articles didn't present any evidence of **deliberate manipulation**.

Thanks for your time in doing this.
Just some feedback:
For the guy who queried about being able to physically touch bitcoins my preferred example is transacting using EFTPOS, explaining that money is already digital and going to shop and using a credit card just involves a bank reducing your digital balance and increasing the shop's digital balance. At no stage does a paper bill change hands. The updating of the bank's ledger represents the value exchange, and then go into your example of bitcoin having a public ledger.
The committee doesn't phrase their questions well. When they say, "does bitcoin get used to launder money" what they actually mean to ask is, "is bitcoin better at laundering money than cash". 
In response to that continue to example of bitcoin being a public although pseudonymous ledger which when converted back to fiat currency captures "identity" under current AML/KYC laws.
Also, because Bitcoin's ledger has a full history it is unlike
 cash where you can only track the last entity that handled it. You don't know who touched the cash before the current person who gives it to you. Therefore Bitcoin is not as fungible as cash.
Finally, the existing laws in place allow supoenas and warrants to be issued that allow authorities to trace transactions once identity has been captured by an exchange. That is sufficient to say confiscate laptops/computers which would assist in putting the identity/address trail back together.
For the person who queried on Bitcoin's intrinsic value, I agree with the comparison to gold being a bubble but he didn't seem very interested going down that route. Rather, Bitcoin's intrinsic value comes from being both a currency and a payment network. At the moment we need to rely on 3rd party payment solutions in order to transact with entities other than face to face. A dollar bill doesn't enable that but Bitcoin does as a payment network.

It’s good to be back.
No coiners who ask “why is bitcoin valuable it’s not backed by anything” scare me.

Could you develop a "MEW"/MyCrypto for bitcoin?
Interface to send transactions, sign messages using private keys, mnemonics, ledger, trezor.
