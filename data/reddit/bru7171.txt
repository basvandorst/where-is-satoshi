Thanks. But yeah, same principle with high tickets. Your old provider set a "limit" to what your highest sale could be (whether you knew it or not). Sometimes it could be limiting you, most times you never have to worry about it.
As far as First Data, we do ~90+% of all the credit card processing in America; most through independent sales offices and banks. So I'd ask what type of sales office of First Data you were signing with. Any ISO (Independent Sales Office) is going to be subject to the same types of restrictions mentioned above. The answer you want is an AGENT office. Which is the closest small/medium businesses can get to dealing with First Data Corporate (As close to 0 restrictions as possible).
While I'm at it. Here is what you want to know. Demand to be on a INTERCHANGE PLUS rate plan. That basically means that you are going to pay cost (Interchange) for all VISA/MC/Disc and a Plus. Where a plus is usually just a percentage on top of cost and a few more cents per transaction.
 
Anything around or below **.30%** (on top of cost) and **$0.05** (per transaction) is a good deal (for most small businesses).
Hope everything works well

[firstdata.com]( is the main site. The email server is from the agent office. But thank you. Yes, someone squatted the domain.

Sales manager from First Data here. The short explanation as to why companies like yourself have these problems is because 3rd party processors and specially bank merchant service providers apply restrictions on business types, processing methods, etc... mostly based on risk. I know full well that many legitimate businesses have been unjustly black listed (GTF/CTMF) because they did some minimal amount/method outside their merchant service provider's acceptance limits. (Shameless plug: I can accept accounts without 99% of these restrictions. Some industries by nature still give even us trouble.)
Bitcoin is still not liked among &gt;50% of merchant service providers. Again, because the 3rd party companies add restrictions to their merchants to shield themselves to possible chargebacks in the future. This is a pressing topic in the industry due to the growth and use of bitcoin. 
My professional opinion is that bitcoin has an uphill battle to get much bigger than it is now. I know it will grow, but you know those little names on the back of your debit cards? STAR, INTERLINK, MAESTRO, NYCE.... As of Jan. 2013 they are now completely owned by the big banks. That means that with every debit card purchase, the big banks are getting a piece. And they won't be happy losing that piece to anyone.
But I hate to see this happen and 99% of the time I can offer a solution to where you don't have to deal with these surprises or difficulties. I hope this helps a little and I'd be happy to help in any way. Whether it's with my business or my advice.
