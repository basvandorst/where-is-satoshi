Can you still participate when the coins are forked? If so, how do you do that with a hardware wallet?

Eh, I've watched enough of these ups and downs.... great for trading. uncertain in the long term, but 350% is nothing to turn your nose up at.

haha... yes, phone loves autocorrect.

I believe they only allow you to hold Bit, Eth, and Lite?

transaction fees and clearing time. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:13:03
Hah, yeah maybe. I'm really not sure what the deal is with opening up the database to account holders. AT least that way the lost coins can mapped to the people who bought them.

I'll join up!

hi thanks for responding!  who is Jared exactly?
I wonder what happened to all the data tables and that? the exchange wouldn't own them so if expect it to be pretty easy to facilitate the transaction.

I made the mistake of buying through bank transfer and it's taken like 7 days to clear... They won't let me make another purchase until the first one clears.
What's killing me is that I wanted to buy IOTA when it was $1.5 and now it's at $5.0.  300% up....

how frequently does this happen?
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:23:28
I don't think the wallet had anything.  I wonder if I even downloaded the transaction from my gox or if I kept it online

addr.dat, blk0001.dat; blkindex.dat; wallet.dat

doing this now --- fingers crossed!
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:34:44
Where do I get the addresses?
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:17:58
Is it possible that my wallet was stored on MtGox? Or that I didn't download the transaction data? I recall jumping through hopes to transfer cash in, and buying a few around the $10 mark, but htat's about it.

I'm only 8 years and 18 weeks behind on the data sync...

Has anyone had any luck getting to their purchased coins?  I bought $100 worth back in June 2011 and I'd like to cash in.  If I remember correctly, they shouldn't be lost as long as there is a tracking number.  Is this correct?

Thamks.... it might be done tonight.  I loaded my wallet in yesterday and it didn't have any coins. Hopefully something comes thru today...
