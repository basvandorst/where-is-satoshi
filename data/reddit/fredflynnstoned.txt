Personally I am not engaged in the business of securing other's wallets, so my answers to these questions are irrelevant to anything. As for Blockchain, I'm going to go out on a limb and say if their user base was 1/5th of what it is, they would not have just raised $30M.  So in that sense, they appear to be in the business of building a product and user base that top tier VC firms want a piece of, and they are doing a good job of that.

Fuck no. You're a cool dude bro, the cigar toting pic was boss. This shit is retarded though. Finish your Javasript project. You ask for the community's opinion on starting a company... How high are you? What the fuck kind of credentials do you have? Keep coding, focus on what you're good at. Social media isn't for you.

If the local working girls accepted BTC this would blow up. They should have approached the neighborhood pimps with their plan first.
