Kind of like the Nicehash hacking...could of been an inside hacking....but I doubt Slovenia government has high security regulations compared to US to deter companies from doing this.

Good point yea.

"You know what you are investing in whereas when you put money into Wall Street you have no idea what they will do." - What do you mean by this?
"a proper investment must be backed by reputable institutions such as Wall Street banks, " - What do you mean by this?

Trevon said on his stream today that everyone was refunded and no one lost money. Looks like he is lying to the end.

When are they supposed to expire this week?

It just went below 10k on GDAX. 245 buy wall at 10k vanished. Videod it.

You will probably have to pay IRA early withdrawal fee now too if you sell.

You don't get the money you put into bit connect back? Also, doesn't look like Craig Grant and Trevon James are doing so bad financially.

If scalability issues are solved and mass adoption continues then I don't see why not? If this isn't the case then no.

Anything over a $10k deposit gets examined for criminal activity regardless if related to crypto. If you frequently deposit amounts below $10k to not get examined, they can take your money out of the bank as a civil asset forfeiture. on suspicion trying to launder the money without it getting checked out then you would have to fight with lawyers to get it back (lawyer fees would cost more than the 10k so you lose it to the government). This only applies though if you do it frequently though...
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:20:15
Exactly. Their ads always popped up on Youtube about Bitconnect. They came off as scammy to me, the business model was a big red flag to me as well.
Good Video on this:

Well, scalability issues have not been solved so I'm not seeing a reason to justify it going back to 17k besides speculation which isn't good.

" It's healthy."
What do you mean by this?
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:11:31
What has changed with it since it was 12k-13k?
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:48:13
Whats going on in February? Lightning Network?
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:09:50
yea I mean 50k on an outside exchange is pretty sketchy but I don't think OP probably considered this when putting money in.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:16:19
I know people who have transferred more than this....yesterday they did wire transfer....no problems...
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:15:42
I really want to see Bitcoin Core overcome its scalability issues as it is the original pioneer vs. Bitcoin Cash

People who work at banks aren’t bad people but the system is set up with perverse incentives  where they rationalize over time that what they are doing is okay. Banks will do bad things knowing they will only get slapped on the wrist with just a fine, but they just factor this into the cost of doing business.
Wells Fargo made fake accounts…the CEO made 200 million in bonuses.. from driving up the stock price…5k lower employees were fired while the head of the department made 150 million. None of them went to jail. Customers frauded…people screwed. The entire financial system is full of corruption to a point where it threatens the stability of the world economy as these problems are not being addressed. Bitcoin is not advanced enough to deal with this problem. 
Bitcoin is a way of protest to leave the system. Voting in elections does not work..Trump or Hilary would of both put banking people by their sides. Organizational structures and incentives need to change but regulators are part of this same system…that produces these outcomes so nothing changes. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:42:43
I know what you are talking about. Then it shoots 20 sell/buy orders of 1 bitcoin (like a machine gun) to drive the price up/down then removes them all.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:32:12
I hope so.

hmmmm i don't remember reading this part in the white paper. Maybe I missed this part!
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:50:07
Bitcoin will be a failed project if it can't scale...this is true...but I think this can be overcome. Its current state though is unacceptable if it is to be a currency.

Is Coinjar US based?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:30:11
Have you bought coins before? (I have not).
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:01:06
People want to make big gains though and the only way to do that is to risk more (typically more than they should).
Here is a prime example (edit):
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:54:34
Is it US based?

Wow this is really bad lol. Title is accurate OP.

It is if you wanna go hang out with Ross Ulbricht for a few months.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:57:08
The article mentioned hackers selling off Bitcoin which would be temporary but never talked about the technology issues Bitcoin is facing which look long-term as no working solution can be implemented soon. Might take a 6 months - year or longer to implement Lightning network? Only is 30% done and that took a couple of years to get that point.

My prediction is that John Mcafee will be sitting in a chair, bent frontward, and will be eating his own dick live on television for all traumatized Bitcoiners to watch.
I will be using my titcoins to purchase the ppv to watch this magnificent event.

What is the problem with this? (srs). I don't get the point here. The $ is supposed to stay the same value as it was in 1913?
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:47:10
I don't cash expect to hold value. I just put most of my savings into things that hold value that keep up with inflation or surpass it. I don't see Bitcoin as a necessity for me personally.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:13:43
That makes it more trustworthy vs. a place like Nicehash (based out of Slovenia).

Well here in the USA, I don't see how it is advantageous as either over just having credit card/cash right now.
@_date: 2018-08-04 05:38:35
ETF or not Bitcoin still not advantageous over credit card/cash unless you live in Venezuela.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:54:10
Looking at cryptos right now....4.5% from the stock market doesn't hurt me so bad. You guys seem to lose that x3 with 1 day
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:39:37
Doom and gloom guys like this have missed out on years worth of gains from the stock market.
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:27:10
If the vision of Bitcoin was complete and not early stage. What would be the incentive to use it over USD here in USA?

Well if you look at my karma, I don't care about fake points on a website so no problem. 
Ross's argument and point of Silk Road is that people will do drugs regardless and better this way than having drug cartels selling leading to the street violence and drug wars we have today. If overall that is true, wouldn't Silk Road be better?
Then again, making hardcore drugs highly accessible.....
@_date: 2018-07-16 00:11:28
This is a big one to me. How is bitcoin advantageous over credit card/cash in USA? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 01:36:48
Past does not predict future performance. This is just speculation.
