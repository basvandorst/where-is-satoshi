Great thanks for pointing me in the right direction. And yes the user above kindly recommended those hardware storage options too. I think Ledger offline wallet looks most user-friendly for my case. It's expensive though, but i guess it's worth it in terms of security

thank you for the tip. I've looked into the Ledger and Trezor. Does offline storing mean on hardware wallets only? Or are there alternative solutions where one does not have to buy physical hardware? 
Has anyone tried keepkey wallet? I'm not able to find any review about it online.

Noted, I appreciate the recommendation.

Excellent, thank you. It makes it so much easier to lay out the steps in a similar way. I have bookmarked that guide, which will be shared with some friends who are also interested in learning how to buy bitcoins (slightly less than 10k worth).
For the step n.1 what would be the difference between offline and cold storage? The two types of bitcoin wallets seem to be the same thing. Are there any good examples of each?

I'm reading similar opinions from other replies here. I think the hardware option will be my chosen path for the storing the bitcoins after purchase. There are some good youtube tutorials with step by step instructions... very reassuring TBH.


Still not too sure about which exchange to use. And yes the wire transfer delay is something that I'm worried about to a certain extent. I hear reviews of people waiting weeks for their bank transfer deposit to go through because their exchange is in another country far away. 
It's true that the verification process of these exchanges seems kind of daunting too. I'll keep that in mind regarding Bitstamp.

cool, blockchain wallet is a place that many have recommended to me. I might just store a small amount of my total, for quick payments if i ever need to. I see that it is also possible to buy bitcoin on blockchain info. Though only with a credit card (so high fees right?)
