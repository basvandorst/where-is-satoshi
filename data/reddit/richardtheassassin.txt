However, we will have to work out shipping and Customs clearance, in particular any restrictions on agricultural imports -- most countries don't allow raw fruits and vegetables to be shipped because of the risk of diseases, for example [the blight that caused the Irish Potato Famine]( or [the blight that has nearly wiped out the American chestnut tree](  Please feel free to put him in contact with me.

Not sure what you're trying to say there.  Bitcoin works well for international payments.  Do you think that there aren't going to be bank fees and delays for transmitting money internationally and converting currencies?
It generally takes three business days and costs the equivalent of US$25, plus whatever losses from the exchange rates the banks on each end use, plus a currency conversion fee that usually runs around US$20.  If going to or from the U.S., add another $25 to $50 in fees because FREEDOM!!! and local banks not being able (or allowed) to send payments internationally directly;  they have to route SWIFT payments through a "correspondent bank" such as Wells Fargo or Citibank.
My company's typical cost (from Taiwan) to send a medium-sized payment ($1000) to a business in the U.S. through the banking system is $70.  For bitcoin, it's a few cents -- or $20 if both sides have to go through an exchange that eats 1% on each end.  Well worth it.

If you want to avoid a mess, go talk with a tax attorney.  NOT A CPA, see an ATTORNEY.  If you're willing to pay the taxes, there's no reason not to spend a couple of grand on legal fees to make sure it's done right -- and to have a contact in case the IRS goes nuts on you.
I may be mistaken, but I think you will get taxed at "ordinary income" rates, so you would want to cash out only a portion of it per tax year to avoid getting into the 39% tax bracket.
However, you also want to avoid doing it at too low an amount, because you don't want the jackasses to start screaming about "structuring transactions", because that leads to you screaming about "asset forfeiture" and "prison rape".

There are at least two local exchanges.
BitoEx.com seems to be focusing on the retail TWD-&gt;BTC market, with three of the four major convenience store chains offering bitcoin purchases on their kiosks;  I don't know if they convert in the other direction, but I assume so.
I've heard that MaiCoin.com both buys and sells, but I haven't gotten any bitcoins as payments so I have not needed to use their service.
One issue, your title says that YOU "would like [them] to accept Bitcoin."  Do THEY want to accept bitcoin?

Neither of these addresses the real issue, which is governments overspending, causing their central banks to devalue the national currency.  Look at Argentina, Venezuela, and Greece at present.  The same thing can be said of most other governments, from Rome to Weimar Germany to Zimbabwe.
Even aside from devaluations, the resulting messes usually result in confiscatory taxation, mob rule, and turmoil.  Not to mention revolutions.  Which lead to new governments doing the same damn thing for the benefit of the new ruling class. . . .

Edit: googled it, oh, it was just 64-bit instead of 32?  So vat, beeg deal.
Regardless, both of the comments that I replied to (OP and someone else's) are specifically about Moore's "Law".
Sure, you can shorten pipelines or use multiple pipelines or do vector pipelines or add cores so that a bunch of processes can run at once without interfering with each other or whatever.  Those are all relatively narrowly applicable compared to the broad overall speed improvements that came from shrinking sizes and increasing clock speeds.  Edit: and doubling the width likewise isn't all that great;  sure, you can represent huge integers or really precise floating-point numbers, but in terms of instruction crunching speeds, all else being equal, it slows things down because you have to move twice as much memory around and you get half as much space in your caches.
An honest benchmark for processing speed is a simple single-threaded linear calculation.  All the rest is art and marketing.

"Moore's Law" was never a "law", it was an observation on his part.  And we started slamming into the physical limits a little over a decade ago;  the latest semiconductor processes have feature sizes that are literally only a few atoms wide, and they cannot be shrunk any further.  Likewise, clock speeds have become so high that they cannot be increased significantly any longer, because they cannot shrink the chips further -- higher clock speeds require smaller chips in order not to be afflicted by propagation delays and other transmission line effects.
I've seen figures ranging from 1:10 to 1:3 for electrical vs speed-of-light, so we might get one more order of magnitude out of a photonic computer if we ever become capable of making one.  I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.

He doesn't understand how stocks work, either.  I'm basing that on eight years of seeing his drivel on ZeroHedge (the Russian agitprop website), BTW.
What will drive Bitcoin's value is people using it for actual real-world transactions.  After Web 2.0 crashes and burns -- just like Web 1.0 did -- I would like to think that Silly Valley investors will start looking for revenue streams instead of "eyeballs" and "they're burning lots of money so they must be building something awesome!" as metrics.  And Bitcoin is perfectly situated to build that revenue stream.
A penny to view an article on WSJ?  Sure, why not.  I'm sure as hell not going to spend $50 on an annual subscription, but a single article view isn't going to kill me.  And the WSJ gets incremental revenue that they otherwise wouldn't have seen, and because they have lots of articles that I don't care about, I'm not feeling like I've wasted my money on all that crap just to see the one I cared about.  Hell, I might even give them a nickel.
Same with a thousand other web services.
And so 500,000,000 first-worlders will want to have a Bitcoin wallet that they can throw twenty bucks into and forget about for a few months.  Ten times that many third-worlders will want to put a few dollars in also.  And at that point, the larger transactions will also want to use Bitcoin for small wholesale transactions -- a retailer buying a hundred Christmas light sets from China, or some kid buying e-cig nicotine for his huffing habit.
That's how Bitcoin will grow in the long term.  Overstock.com was a nice start, but we need lots more.
@_date: 2017-01-28 05:00:48
No.  How would it?  Is Bitcoin traffic somehow uniquely recognizable in a way that would allow ISPs to shut it down entirely?  If so, don't you think that the community could work around that, just as people do with VPNs, Tor, and all the other tricks?
And if they cannot recognize it and shut it down entirely, then so what if your traffic takes 2000ms instead of 10ms?
The fight by Comcast/TWC against "Net Neutrality" is just a money grab by the ISPs;  they aren't stupid enough to shut down entire fields of functionality.

What country are you in, and if in the U.S., what state?  Was the BTC purchased before the marriage or during?  Laws vary wildly.
EDIT: ok, after running into someone else's comment and rereading the OP more carefully, **this is a premarital asset.  TALK TO A LAWYER and DON'T MOVE ANYTHING UNTIL YOU DO.  You don't want a court to say that something you did changed it from a sole asset to a marital asset.**
If purchased before the marriage, in some states it would be considered a pre-marital asset and not subject to division.  In others, the increase during the marriage would be divisible even if it were purchased before and kept separate from marital assets.  I'll assume you don't have a prenup covering your Bitcoin, because otherwise you wouldn't need to ask.


Not really.  This suggests to me that you're in the U.S.  The thing about mortgage interest in the U.S. is that it is deductible from your taxes, but -- and here's the important thing -- you're still paying the bank several times what you get to deduct.  Example, you pay $10,000 in interest to the bank, and your tax rate is 25%, that means you pay $2,500 less in federal taxes.  You still got fucked to the tune of $7,500 being paid out to the bank.
Note that if you sell any of it, and assuming you stay legal on your U.S. taxes, this means she'll still find out that you had it because you're going to have to list it on your taxes.  Moreover, if it's in one big block that you split up to sell some, a competent divorce lawyer would investigate the blockchain to see if you might be hiding a shitload more of assets somewhere that "belong" to your soon-to-be-ex-wife.
Also, under no circumstances split them with her ahead of time.  If she wastes all of hers and then demands more, and then divorces you because you wouldn't give her what she wanted, you'll still end up having to give her half of the remaining assets.
It's kind of too bad you didn't get legal advice to plan ahead on this.  You might have been able to use separate assets (e.g., an inheritance), put them in a trust, and be sheltered.
Talk to a lawyer NOW.
Another option, frankly, is to conceal them, get divorced, and then keep your Bitcoin off the grid until it's way too late for her to do anything about it.  You could sell millibits and satoshis to randos for years, live off that, and be able to save everything you make from work.

Here's the thing, RSK isn't Bitcoin.  If they screw up, it doesn't affect the main system.
Ethereum hard-forked because of the DAO and, last I looked, was discussing whether to hard-fork to save people again from the latest wallet disaster or wait for the already-planned other hard-fork to fix some other problems and roll the wallet fix into that one.
And there was an article just last week, around the same time as Vitalik made his opinion known about child pornography, about Vitalik thinking that they should end the mining fees so that there's a fixed supply of ETH because apparently he thinks that's a good idea now.  So maybe there'll be another major hard-fork that totally changes a fundamental concept of Ethereum.
It's almost like you can't count on Ethereum to do what they promised.  "Code is law," my ass.

Not everyone has access to every exchange, or even to the internet.  Where I reside, there are two exchanges, one BTM (somewhere, it keeps getting bought and moved), and individual exchangers using Localbitcoins.com (LBTC).  LBTC is a pain in the ass and they all try to get ridiculous amounts for their BTC, so that's kinda out at this point.  It's for the lowest of low-information newbies.
The BTM used to charge about a 10% fee, back when it was the only place other than arranging something with an individual through LBTC  Then one of the exchanges got set up and integrated with one of the major convenience store chains, and they only charged what they claimed was a 1% fee, so the BTM owner eventually gave up and got rid of his machine to someone else.  Then a second exchange got set up and was charging about 2%.  The first exchange's fees were really more like 3% to buy in because they gave a shitty rate on currency conversion.  Then both exchanges started jacking up fees and now it's about 5% each way, so 10% if you do a round-trip from fiat to BTC to fiat again.
I suppose I could do an international wire transaction to Kraken/Coinbase/GDAX/Bitfinex/BTC-E (ha-ha), get robbed of the 2% conversion rate (set by the government), pay the high banking fees for the wire transfer ($75 last time I did one), wait a week for it to go through, hope the other exchange doesn't screw me by demanding paperwork out the wazoo for months, and then buy BTC from the other place.  By the time I go through all that, I might as well have just paid the fucking 5% to the local vermin.
In Zimbabwe, there's also the issue that their currency is shit and nobody outside of that country wants to touch it.  At least here there's some semblance of a market and I can actually do an exchange when I go overseas, even though the rate is worse than what the banks locally will give on exchanging to USD or EUR.  (And on the plus side, the local currency has appreciated about 10% against the USD in the last year and a half, so I got that goin' for me.)
Add to that the liquidity problems that others have mentioned, and demand, and that's why Zimbabweans are paying a 60%-ish premium.

There's some sort of time limit in Ethereum, though.  Remember when the DAO got hacked and they had a hard limit of something like 30 days to decide whether to do a hard fork or not?
So, maybe Vitalik is only referring to Ethereum's limitations.
Edit: but hey, if there's a problem, Ethereum can always do another hard fork!!!

More real-world transactions are, I think, a good thing, but I don't see this sort of transaction being illustrative of a really useful use of bitcoin.  I've bought a technical e-book from a publisher in Switzerland, donated money to keep a server running without having to identify myself, and bought some electronics from the U.S., all without paying currency conversion fees or credit card fees, and all from the middle of nowhere in Asia.

No, actually, it isn't.  Regressions can be fit to any sort of curve.  And in the case of Bitcoin, it makes some sense to use a log curve because one often-used model for the price is Metcalfe's Law, i.e., that Bitcoin's value correlates to an exponential function of the number of people who are using it (usually "square of number of users multiplied by average transaction size").

There is a single exchange, BTCGreece.com
According to news reports on them, they are only accepting limited exchanges right now because they don't want the authorities to go after them for aiding capital flight.  But at least you can get your account set up.
Also, remember: DO NOT LEAVE YOUR BTC AT AN EXCHANGE.  Create your own wallet/address and transfer all BTC to that address (or multiple addresses), and keep the addresses secure with multiple backups and encryption.  If you lose a bitcoin private key, you will never be able to access the funds again.
Like keeping cash at home, you have to keep your bitcoin private keys safe from thieves, but also from accidental loss.

Every new generation of semiconductor equipment costs significantly more than the previous generation, and the cost/benefit ratio is restricting further increases in speed and decreases in size.

I don't have any connection to any exchange.
Kindly explain how an exchange located in, say, Russia, is going to be affected by FinCen's ridiculous attempts at overreach.  Be specific.  How are their assets going to be seized, how are the principals going to be arrested, what stealth bomber technology will be used to evade Russian radar in order to deliver a nuke on target.

Did I write that I wasn't paying taxes on it?  No?  Oh, shitty strawman.  Sucks to be you.
What I wrote was that THEY, as in THE SOCIALISTS, are terrified that Bitcoiners will be able to escape from confiscation.


Apparently you haven't been paying attention to Venezuela for, oh, the last five years or so. . . .
Remember when Sweden had a 105% top income tax rate?  That's right, if you made a LOT of money, they confiscated everything you earned PLUS some more to cut you down to size.
And even today in Brazil, you cannot run a business without engaging in constant tax evasion, because if you pay all of the required taxes and fees, it will cost you more than 100% of your profits.  It's mathematically impossible to follow all the tax laws there and stay afloat.

The very link you provide states quite clearly that it is "treated as property":


That's the title right there, copied-and-pasted from the very link you supplied.
They don't "call it a currency", they use the term "virtual currency" repeatedly because that's what people are calling it and the IRS chose to use the nomenclature that people are using.
In fact, they specifically guide **away** from calling it a "currency":


by making it clear that it **isn't** one.
Also, one of your previous statements gives me considerable pause, where you wrote:


This neglects, among other things, the entire asset class of real property, which has quite a lot of special rules governing its treatment, and skips past all of the micromanaging of various different forms of personal property that the IRS engages in.
If you come back and tell me you're a tax attorney, I will cheerfully go sulk in a corner and tell myself that we're just talking past each other, but if you're not, hey, I may not have used any of that stuff since graduating, but I at least got a passing grade in the basic tax law class I took.

So, this won't really do much for Bitcoin itself.  I wonder how they plan to handle the 


part if they don't link a currency to the transactions.  Sure, they could have the interpreter send a SMS to a bank to have the bank send the payment, or require that cash be paid in to a central authority that then maintains accounts, but that still leaves the problem of a central authority that can unwind transactions, or have a government body order funds seized, or whatever.
I guess they can secure it all by having "mining fees" tied to the contracts.

Considering that the reason they had such cheap electricity was that the government was subsidizing it, heavily, with the result that demand soared and the government unsustainably drew down the reservoir behind the main hydroelectric power generation station, to the point that they now only have electricity for a few hours every few days . . . I'd say that neither were they.

We've been discussing this in The original clickbait article is wrong, and all of these clickbait "freebooters" repeating it are also wrong.  One ministry official insists it's illegal and that they'll pass laws against it Real Soon Now.
But until they pass those laws against it, it's still legal, and I would like to hope that the rest of the government has enough sense not to pass such laws anyway.  (But TBH, the legislature here is pretty fucked up and still stuck in the martial-law-era mindset.)

It really depends on where you are.  If you have any friends in Taiwan, it's easy to buy any amount of BTC at three of the four major convenience store chains for about 3% in fees (the exchange claims 1% in "fees" but then they really gouge hard on the conversion exchange rate).
I haven't tried going directly to an exchange to see if either of the two here would sell for closer to par.

Two years ago, the only way for me to obtain bitcoin (other than mining, which meant sending cash off to a shady company that would sit on it for a year and tell me that my miner was "a preorder and would be shipped in due course") was to find someone on Localbitcoins and pay a 25% premium.
A year and a half ago, someone installed the first and only Bitcoin ATM on the entire island of 26,000,000 people, which sold BTC at 10% over the current price.
A year ago, someone made a deal with the local convenience store chains, who all have kiosks in-store for ticket purchases and bill payments, so that anyone could walk in and obtain BTC for 1% over the current market price.  3000+ stores scattered everywhere, usually within walking distance of anyone's house.
No ecosystem there, nope, nosirree.

It's almost entirely China money movement.  Currently Huobi is at 579.xx while the other two are at 51x.xx and 52x.xx.  Basically, the Chinese are trying to get their money out before another expected round of devaluations.
Some of this may get cycled, some may be HODL'ed, hard to say.  Once the huge disparity between Huobi and the other exchanges settles down again, I would be unsurprised at a drop.  However. for as long as that huge disparity exists, I expect the price to keep climbing.
Basically, if you can get BTC into China, you can make quite a lot -- it's almost a MtGox arbitrage situation all over again, if only you have a way to get cash out of China in some non-Bitcoin fashion, such as settling other transactions.

Hillary is the clear choice for such an environment.  Under her leadership, Bitcoin will surely soar to the Moon relative to the USD.

Interesting that they are choosing Ethereum.  To the extent that their voting system doesn't need money associated with the tokens, I guess it can work.
