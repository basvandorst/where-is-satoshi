No I'm not. Those are all examples of ACH deposits. Like the other guy who posted the same link, you have no clue what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:40:50
You truly do not know how any of this works.
In the United States, there are basically three ways to credit a consumer deposit account:
1. In-person deposit of cash and/or negotiable instruments
2. ACH transfer
3. Wire transfer
"Direct deposit" is basically a colloquial term for "ACH transfer." If you are making regular monthly ACH deposits of $250 or more, you absolutely *do* "have direct deposit sent them."

@_date: 2018-01-24 21:08:14


Not true. There is no requirement that the "direct deposit" must be a payroll deposit:


More importantly, *I* have not claimed at any point that it has to be a payroll deposit. You saw "direct deposit" in my comment, ignored the handy parenthetical note that I kindly included for the benefit of people like you, got confused, and jumped at a perceived opportunity to smugly call somebody out for an imaginary mistake.


ACH deposit = "direct deposit." All of the "other methods" listed on the page you linked are ACH deposits. Therefore, they are not "other methods."
It's amazing to me that you are still not getting this. I know you desperately want to believe that you've somehow gotten one over on the banks, but this is now officially ridiculous.

1. This is old old old news. I hate big banks as much as the next guy, but do we really have to revisit this topic every three months and pretend that it's some kind of unprecedented atrocity?
2. Honestly, if you don't have at least one direct deposit over $250 going into your checking account once a month, you are not "low-income." You are probably literally a child. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:23:16

@_date: 2018-01-24 14:43:15
No. Your bank can tell the difference between a "direct deposit" (ACH) transaction and a regular deposit.
There's a reason they specify that it must be a "direct deposit": if you're going to maintain a low average daily balance, they want to at least be the bank that receives your paycheck, because that makes it much more likely that you'll stick with them when you're making more money later in life. 
Low-balance secondary checking accounts aren't worth anything to a bank, and actually cost the bank some money to maintain thanks to bundled services (e.g. ATM and debit card access, teller transactions, online banking, etc.)
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:44:32


Tell that to Betamax and LaserDisc.
Consider [the Canadian dollar banknote]( if you're interested in a slightly more relevant example. It's currently worth about 20% less than its technologically inferior American equivalent. Why?
Technology has never been and will never be the only thing that matters when it comes to money. It's really important to understand that. Many people in the crypto community seem to be allergic to the fact that the future success of Bitcoin depends on politics and economics as well as cryptography.

[Bank of America Personal Schedule of Fees:](






This is what happens when you get all of your knowledge about banking and financial services from blogs promoted on instead of going to the source like a normal adult.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:06:46
Again, this isn't about punishing "low-income individuals." It's expensive to service low-balance secondary checking accounts belonging to people who have no other business with you. Bank of America doesn't want to do that. This is their way of trying to avoid it.
There are other ways to avoid the maintenance fee, and plenty of banks that are less demanding. Do you think that Bank of America has some kind of moral obligation to provide free banking services to everyone who shows up, regardless of circumstances?
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:31:25


If you want to be pedantic about it, the payment technically isn't coming from you. It's coming from the other bank at which you have an account.


Sure. And it's common sense that banks want you to keep as much of your money with them as possible--hence the minimum daily balance waiver. Does that mean it's some kind of super clever trick to deliberately stay just barely above the minimum?
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:13:41
Interesting. Maybe a functional alternative to Coinbase for some people?
I wonder how they handle tax reporting.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:12:21
I hope that someone is already working on a functional, user-friendly wallet. If the goal is to make Bitcoin ready for widespread adoption, that's just as important as the underlying tech.
I want to be able to do the following:
- "Load" a payment channel with any reasonable amount of Bitcoin, at any time, without needing to know or trust any counterparty
- Use that payment channel to transact seamlessly, cheaply, and quickly with any other Lightning Network user
- Export a complete history of all transactions for tax reporting purposes
That last point is crucial. Every single Bitcoin transaction that results in an exchange of value is subject to capital gains taxation. I want to be able to use Bitcoin for over-the-counter coffee purchases and the like, but I won't do it if I know it will lead to an accounting nightmare at the end of the year.
All of those things are possible in principle, right?
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:04:46
Some banks in the U.S. are less restrictive, but they are likely to lose money on that business as a result. The idea is that these promotions will cause them to retain enough customers to justify the expense over the long run, but that's ultimately a gamble. 
Free low-balance checking is effectively a [loss leader]( for a bank. A lot of people don't seem to understand that.
Our big national banks have been quite a bit stingier with the deposit account promotions in recent years--probably because they have been struggling to make money on the retail side ever since 2008.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:10:44
Yeah, that should work. Any ACH deposit over $250 will trigger the fee waiver.
Do a lot of banks allow free ACH transfers now, or is Coinbase an exception? I remember it used to cost at least a few bucks.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:07:12


No, Bank of America does *not* say that. I quoted their schedule of fees verbatim. Go back and actually read it. There is no exclusion for ACH transfers between personal accounts.


I have not disputed this at any point. Neither has Bank of America. I even put "ACH" in parentheses after "direct deposit" in my original comment. I tried my best to explain to you that ACH transfers and direct deposits *are the same fucking thing.* **Read more slowly.**


@_date: 2018-01-27 19:06:50
This really does not worry me in the least.
Running a well-connected Lightning node will be a lot like staking: you'll commit some of your BTC and receive fees in return for supporting the network. The more channels you open, the more popular your node will be, the more fees you will be able to collect. That creates an incentive to open as many channels as possible. 
Eventually node operators will come up with formulas meant to calculate the optimum size and number of channels to open, which will depend on the state of the network and the total amount of BTC you're willing to commit. If people really do begin making daily coffee purchases with BTC, it will be possible for practically anyone to earn some amount of fee revenue by running a node on ordinary consumer hardware and opening a handful of small channels. You can bet that a lot of everyday people will want in on that--just as a lot of people were willing to use their own PCs for mining in the early days.
Will some nodes handle many more transactions and make much more money than the average? Sure. But how is that any different from mining or staking? From the very beginning, people with access to more hashing power have been allowed to handle more transactions and earn more in return for their greater "effort."
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:42:50
No. I see why you're confused, but "online banking transfer" clearly does not just mean any kind of transfer that you do over the internet. The vast majority of payroll deposits would also count as "online banking transfers" if that were the case.
In this context, it means transfers between Bank of America accounts, via Bank of America's own Online Banking service. That's why "Online Banking" is capitalized.

Coinbase is going to be just fine.
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:20:08
My point is that "market/user consensus" is the actual decider when it comes to questions about things like "realness," proper names, the assignment of ticker symbols, etc. There is no such thing as "network consensus" on questions like that, because those aren't attributes assigned by the protocol or transactions committed to the blockchain.
It's true that a more valuable network is likely to show more accumulated difficulty, but that's an *effect*, not a cause. It would make exactly as much sense to just look at the price and decide based on that--which is arguably how exchanges and other blockchain businesses make these decisions in actual practice.
So how is "market/user consensus" achieved in the first place? As I've already pointed out, it emerges from public discourse, institutional inertia, and various other forces that work to shape and sway popular opinion.
That answer doesn't sit well with a lot of people in this community, because we'd all prefer to believe that everything about Bitcoin is apolitical, self-regulated, and governed exclusively by immutable rules, but I think it's important to be honest about this. There simply is no getting away from politics. We have to be willing to acknowledge that if we want to be smart about managing the related hazards.

I agree with your conclusion, but don't agree that it has anything whatsoever to do with the longest chain rule.
The Bitcoin protocol does not have the ability to settle questions about things like authenticity and naming conventions. We still have to do that the old-fashioned way, through conversation and politics. To the extent that accumulated difficulty is an indicator of general popularity, I guess you can argue that it serves as a piece of evidence in Bitcoin's favor, but it's disingenuous to pretend that we have a rule in place that can definitively determine which of two independent Bitcoin blockchains is the "real" one.

"Self help garbage" was admittedly a bit harsh.
Rothbard, Hayek, and Mises are all obviously respectable and important figures in the history of economics, even if they are now generally regarded as the leaders of a movement that failed. On the other hand, Lew Rockwell and Peter Schiff are essentially just hacks who pander to libertarians via blogs and podcasts. Finding them listed on the same page as Locke reminded me of seeing books on meditation and crystal healing in the "philosophy" section at B&amp;N--hence the snarky comment.
If you just want to dip a toe in and get a sense of the debate, I would honestly recommend something like [Keynes Hayek,]( which is written for a popular audience and gives a nice overview of the central disagreements.

Lots of professors are wrong about lots of things. Most professors are not "idiots." Please try to appreciate the difference.

It's entirely possible that you and the Austrians have been right all along. All I'm saying is that you should be honest with yourself about the likelihood of that possibility.

Thanks...I did consider that possibility, but couldn't make sense of it as an answer to my question, because demand has already exceeded supply many times. If there were never any excess demand, the transaction fee would never increase.
We've already seen [full blocks.]( We've also already seen [astronomical fees.]( Apparently neither of those signal the moment at which "demand exceeds supply."

No, I didn't. The reason I assume only one on-chain transaction per person is that it takes at least one on-chain transaction to open a payment channel. I'm actually treating a fully functional and 100% adopted LN as a given.


I understand that. But shouldn't it be possible in principle for the whole world to use Bitcoin? Also, keep in mind that all of my other assumptions are extremely conservative. Obviously it's unlikely that the average LN user will only ever do a single on-chain transaction.

If you believe in Austrian economics, then it obviously does make sense to be pro-Bitcoin. But there are other reasons to be pro-Bitcoin, and it isn't clear that promoting Austrian economics is the best way to promote Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-06-10 15:18:18
You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:22:53
You have fundamentally misunderstood the problem.
First off, it isn't remotely clear that Bitcoin is a true deflationary currency. Deflation isn't synonymous with appreciation. When fiat currencies become more valuable relative to other fiat currencies, we generally do not refer to that as "deflation." No respectable economist would describe the stock market as "deflationary" just because stocks tend on average to increase in value.
Bitcoin also isn't deflationary in the sense that its supply is fixed or decreasing. On the contrary, the circulating supply of Bitcoin increases every ten minutes, and will continue to do so for approximately the next 120 years. So I'm not sure why people in the crypto community insist on characterizing Bitcoin as a "deflationary" asset.
But all of that is ultimately beside the point, because "deflation" refers to something that can happen to a *currency.* It is completely unrelated to the normal appreciation that is always expected of an *investment.* Furthermore, it's a problem for the economy as a whole, not necessarily for the person who owns the deflating asset. It disincentivizes investment, which leads to the misallocation (i.e. "hoarding") of capital.
The stock market does literally the opposite of that. It's meant to reward people for putting their money to work. Speculating on the future price of a digital asset with no intrinsic value does not count as putting your money to work. It does nothing to strengthen the wider economy. To the extent that it drags down the spending power of people who would otherwise be demanding productive economic activity, it directly *harms* the economy--which is ultimately a bad thing for everyone.
Here's another way of looking at this: even if Bitcoin has been good to you personally, consider the fact that the person who bought your Bitcoin might have otherwise spent that money on shares of stock in a company that actually makes something. Is it really better for *you* to have that money, because you bought some Bitcoin when it was cheaper and successfully sat on it for a while?
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:41:04


Utter bullshit.
Scarcity alone is not enough to make an asset valuable. You also need reliable and sufficiently abundant demand, which requires a healthy economy. Hoarding capital is arguably the very worst thing you can do for the health of the economy.


Only if those savings are put to work. Bitcoins that sit unused on a Ledger Nano S are not doing any work.
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:42:54


Saving/investing is already incentivized at all levels of the wealth curve, by interest and dividends and appreciation. As you've already conceded, the obstacles faced by lower-income people have nothing to do with the fact that USD (for example) is an inflationary currency. I believe you actually called that suggestion "preposterous."
*Hoarding* Bitcoin is certainly easier than investing fiat money, and is permissionless, and is (sometimes) highly profitable as a result of the fact that cryptocurrency happens to be a rapidly appreciating asset class at the moment, but none of that has anything to do with the fact that there is a hard limit on the number of bitcoins that can be created.
Nevermind that money-hoarding on a large scale would ultimately have catastrophic long-term consequences "at all levels of the wealth curve." I hate to be the one to break this to you, but you're parroting cryptolibertarian folk economics with no basis in reality.


Which hierarchy? Would you say that people like Jed McCaleb and Roger Ver occupy "the bottom of the hierarchy?"
The problem is wealth *concentration,* regardless of where it concentrates--which is why your claim that crypto wealth "concentrates at the bottom" is totally incoherent. Wherever wealth concentrates is "the top" by definition!


I would truly love to see you try to defend every part of this claim.
For the sake of clarity, here is what you have to show:
1. Bitcoin is in fact a deflationary currency.
2. Debt denominated in Bitcoin is intrinsically harder to issue than debt denominated in a fiat currency, *by virtue of the fact that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.*
3. The issuance of debt is one of the principle causes of wealth inequality.
EDIT: Incidentally, if you *can* prove  you should go back to school and pursue a PhD in Economics. You may very well find yourself in the running for a Nobel prize.

@_date: 2018-03-31 03:03:55


What you're describing is essentially a pyramid scheme. In a healthy economy, demand for currency should more or less track demand for actual goods and services. If demand is driven entirely by people who hope to resell at a higher price to others who also hope to resell at a higher price...do you see how that isn't sustainable?


Bitcoin does not have a fixed supply. It has a fixed supply *limit.* The supply increases every ten minutes.
Also, the word you're looking for is "diluted."


This is obviously untrue. If you genuinely believe it, you should be paying someone else to manage your investments.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:31:26


Good question. I would personally say [not really]( are very important differences between speculating on the future price of a commodity and actually "pitching in" toward the success of a productive concern. But the word "investment" is a little bit squishy, and different people use it in different ways, so I don't think it would be fair or correct of me to say that people who buy gold are not "making an investment" in any possible sense of the word.
If you think of Bitcoin as a commodity or something akin to a manufactured good, then Bitcoin buyers support the Bitcoin mining industry in the same way that collectors of Beanie Babies supported Ty Inc. That's not quite as bad as burying your money in the backyard, but it arguably isn't nearly as good as helping to capitalize a reputable pharmaceuticals manufacturer or whatever.
If you think of Bitcoin as *money,* then hoarding Bitcoin is about the worst thing you can possibly do for the health of the economy. It's no different from buying a factory only to let it sit idle. It would be much better to lend your unused Bitcoin to a profitable business--but that's obviously infeasible for any business whose profits are realized in a completely different currency (e.g. USD) that is rapidly depreciating relative to the interest payments that will be owed on the loan.
Hopefully that makes the problem a little bit more clear. Deflation (a.k.a. appreciation) obviously isn't an issue for a speculative asset or collectible. It is an issue for any *currency* that hopes to function as a medium of exchange in a healthy economy, because all productive industries require reasonably affordable access to capital.


Not that I'm aware of. It's self-evident that reductions in spending and investment are bad for the economy, at least in the short run. Consider your own example of "real estate that sits empty instead of being rented out or used." Does that seem like an efficient allocation of resources to you? 
The Austrians take issue with the Keynesian remedy of inflationary spending, but they don't claim that money-hoarding is somehow good for the economy in and of itself. They believe that it's a natural and necessary consequence of earlier misallocations of capital.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:46:08
What does that have to do with the difference between inflationary and deflationary stores of value?
EDIT: In other words, do you believe that it's hard to invest US dollars *because* they are inflationary? Do you think that inflation is what prevents working class people from having access to banking services? 
If so, defend those claims. What makes a deflationary currency like Bitcoin superior to an inflationary currency like ETH, which has also vastly appreciated in value, and additionally holds the potential to give its users access to sophisticated decentralized banking services?
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:26:09


It's a bit strange to talk about Bitcoin's "buying power." At this stage, Bitcoin is a currency only in the most notional sense of the word. It can't really be used to buy anything. Exceptions are inevitably *priced* in USD or some other fiat currency, because that is the information that both parties to the transaction actually care about.
Think of it this way: if you owned a classic car that increased in value, would you refer to that as "deflation" and say that the car's "buying power" had increased?
Also, deflation is generally caused by a contraction of the money supply. In fact, [some sources]( explicitly define deflation as an increase in purchasing power with that specific cause. Bitcoin's value is increasing for very different reasons--widespread speculation and a massive pool of untapped potential demand. If it ever achieves full mainstream adoption and becomes widely used as an actual currency, the situation will be very different. As I've already pointed out, the circulating supply of Bitcoin is actually constantly *increasing,* which would normally lead to a slow and steady rate of inflation.


Spending your money on crypto is not the same thing as investing it. Invested capital is ostensibly put to productive use in the economy. The same is true of money you put in a savings account--the bank lends it out or invests it. Buying a bunch of Bitcoin and "hodling" it on a Ledger Nano S is not the same thing. Money hoarding on a large scale would be terrible for the economy.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:36:50
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:33:14


Nonsense. People who have no surplus income cannot "hold" any more easily than they can invest. Among those who can "hold," it will always be true that people who have more in the first place receive a proportionally larger share of any increase in value. You're trying to force a distinction where there is no difference.
When you refer to "mechanisms that are simply not available to lower classes," exactly what do you have in mind?

Exactly right. So do you see that you've allowed yourself to be distracted? As a reminder, the original question was:


And that question was an attempt to get you to clarify this obscure, self-contradictory Zen koan of a claim:


Can you explain in exactly what sense deflationary currencies "concentrate at the bottom," *without reference to features that are purely incidental to the fact that the currency is deflationary*?
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:01:04

Because there hasn't been any need to specify until recently.
There are other ways to do it--e.g. "the original Bitcoin," "the main chain," or simply "Bitcoin"--but all of them carry implicit (arguably incorrect) assumptions, and essentially beg the question.
"Bitcoin Core" is neutral. It doesn't artificially privilege one fork over the other. It doesn't assume from the start that the Bitcoin Cash true believers are definitely wrong. You know exactly what I mean by it, because it's the name of the reference implementation and a common shorthand for the group of developers who contribute to it. So what's the problem?

Both sides are arguing from authority. You're arguing from the authority of some imaginary democratic body with exclusive rights to the Bitcoin brand. That isn't what the white paper meant by "voting." The "realness" of any given Bitcoin fork is not something that can be decided via proof of work.

Of course I do. But it's in a savings account at a bank, not stuffed into a mattress. The fact that you gloss right over this distinction makes it very clear that you have not thought carefully about any of this.




You've accidentally hit on the exact reason why money-hoarding is so harmful to the economy: it makes it more difficult and less affordable for productive enterprises to raise capital when they need it.


This is like saying that droughts are caused by a lack of water. It doesn't actually explain anything.


Again, you're completely ignoring the fact that hoarding capital and removing it from the economy altogether isn't the one and only way to save money and manage risk.


I'm sorry, but this is a comically extreme oversimplification of what happened in 2008.  The crisis would not have been averted if only more people had bars of gold buried in their backyards.

What if it came out that the conspiracy theorists on had been right all along, and Bitcoin Core had been secretly hijacked by some nefarious alliance between Blockstream and The Banks? Would it somehow follow that Bitcoin was not the real Bitcoin?

@_date: 2018-04-27 22:34:14
It's a bit more complicated than that.
Roger's claim is essentially that Bitcoin Cash is a more authentic realization of the original Bitcoin white paper. That isn't a transaction that can be confirmed or rejected. There is no governing body with the authority to overrule it. The miners have some control over what is allowed to happen on the chain that they're mining, but they can't somehow make it an objective fact that their chain is the one and only "real" Bitcoin blockchain.
None of that matters at the end of the day. What matters is that the Bitcoin Core blockchain is much more *popular* than the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, therefore all of the exchanges call it Bitcoin and give it the BTC ticker. No amount of hash power could've prevented them from treating Bitcoin Cash as a straightforward upgrade if they had wanted to do so. Sticking with Bitcoin Core was a business decision informed by popular demand, not the result of some formal democratic process.
Roger may be wrong in some sense, but he isn't wrong on *facts*--because there simply are no facts about the "realness" of any given Bitcoin fork. This is frankly a really stupid controversy that does nothing but create confusion and frustration on all sides.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:28:09
