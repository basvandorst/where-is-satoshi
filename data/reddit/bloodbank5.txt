how can you cross one finger ?

Glad I could help :)

Hey there, I'm currently unemployed and have been taking a lot of road trips around the New England / Eastern Canada area. With a few days' heads-up I'd be willing to help you with this treasure hunt, maybe for a small commission! Cheers

if BCH hashpower is ever close to double that of BTC, then yes BTC becomes vulnerable. until then, BCH is the one vulnerable to this attack

What-ifs can sting, but you did the best you could do with the information you had. Selling what was then a new, unproven commodity for a 500% gain was a smart move.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:37:57
Not that there aren't a million things wrong with the way that CB rolled it out, but wasn't the original reason they agreed to implement BCH in the first place that so many of us were crying over the BCH fork and having not withdrawn our BTC to a private wallet in time?

GDAX has zero fees for converting USD into BTC when placing a limit order that doesn't fill immediately
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:48
Wow, I can't tell you how much I appreciate your thoughtful responses. You have been nothing but helpful! I sent you a PM

Any pools you recommend? I heard Winminer is ok
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:42
17k now!
edit: 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:22:59
True, but it won't stop me from thinking of how that $2k would be $200k :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:08:49
Stupid me lost $2800 (.2 BTC) and 6 months of mining, any hope for me? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:51:24
Not saying this is a conspiracy, but how did they come up with this arbitrary number for the debut of BTC-BCH trading?
BCH trading at $3.1k, BTC needs to drop to $15.5k (exactly 5x current BCH-USD price) to support it. Wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:47:29
What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:11:19
Thank you - nothing much I can screenshot now that NH if offline, but I've been keeping details Excel records of my lost earnings which should help. Thanks for your help, @_date: 2017-12-21 17:33:10
Agreed, I was actually pleasantly-suprised that Segwit was not further down the list
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:12:48
Great post. 
Can we get a dialog going on why Coinbase isn't yet Segwit-ready? The obvious answer that fits the narrative over the past couple of days is that "this helps the case for BCH", and they are in cahoots with Roger Ver. Have they released any statements about Segwit adoption? Are there conceivably huge technical challenges to them deploying Segwit? Thanks
edit: is this their latest roadmap? Security, performance, then Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:11:46
Thanks - I really mean that. I'm sure there are others who have lost even more than I have
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:13:04
Thank you. Please rest knowing that you have made the world a better place many more times over than most people accomplish in their entire lifetime.

If this is true, you own 0.5% of all Bitcoins I'm existence. Delete this post and maybe get in touch with a financial advisor. There are firms that specialize in slowly unloading large amounts of crypto over time without moving the market

If you are new to Bitcoin, remember that:
1) You didn't miss the boat. Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.
2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never "too high" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.
3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.
There were people kicking themselves at $1000 that they missed the boat. These same people will be kicking themselves at $100,000.
edit: [Coinbase]( is probably your best bet for buying your first BTC, but DYOR (do your own research)

Credit cards are instant. it's the ACH xfer from your bank account that take a bit longer

when the power goes out, so does their cell network? honest question but if I had to guess I would think no (for example, Cambodia and Philippines have massive regular outages but their cell towers and networks stay online throughout - it's a safety issue)
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:00:32
Great read, thanks. But just saying if you have 7 of your +6% days in a row you'll have almost exactly +50% in a week (and then be 'that guy' too) :)

Very basic question here to help me understand capital gains. If I:
1) Bought 1 BTC @ $5000
2) Sold 1 BTC @ $10000
3) **Re-invested it all** back into BTC @ $15,000 for .66 BTC (all in the same year)
Do I owe anything in taxes? I basically turned 1 BTC into .66 BTC in one year
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:49
Thanks Luke! I appreciate what you do :D

curious, does that mean US citizens can't use the average cost method?
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:59:50
gotcha - thank you for pointing that out. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:18:10
serious question - why?
