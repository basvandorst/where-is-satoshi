Me too dude, but it's working!

Me too, nothing really gets me to check the price until I see some variation of this gif or a meme
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:18:50
Memes tho
@_date: 2019-07-24 20:05:28
I have not, it's honestly been a while since I've looked back into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:38:21
Thanks! I need to read into how to transfer these into a hard wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-24 20:19:08
Since posting it went up at least $50 USD. Coincidence?! Maybe...
@_date: 2019-07-24 22:40:11
Huh, it's going up on my screen
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:27:24
I'm glad I got us up near the top!

SUPER HACKER MAN
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:30:27
Thanks! I'm surprised a shitpost actually managed to influence the world price on a currency.
The future is interesting.
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:37:04
Glad to have helped! I have maybe 1 million Satoshi or so, I haven't checked in a while.
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:21:32
Jumped up $500 from this, currently sitting at just over $10,000. Fluctuating around that within the last week
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:27:45
Welcome to the fucking show
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:36:08
Currently yes, when I posted it was somewhere near 9600
@_date: 2019-07-24 20:20:04
I would think so mainly on how much more widespread Bitcoin is over etherium
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:46:14
I've gotten a few other friends into it in the last week and would love to have it at my work, but my boss is hesitant with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:38:57
I'm about to right now! 
@_date: 2019-07-25 00:39:14
Seems to be so far. Proof that memes can influence a global currency.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:37:21
How can i join your mining pool? I've seen mining discussions but I would like to join in
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:35:13
God speed to you. what's your moon? 
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:50:00
Honestly I went through top posts in the sub looking for the Bitcoin wizard with "magic internet money" somewhere on it to repost as a "how far we've come" but found this instead. Didn't think it'd actually get this much traction, despite knowing how well known the gif is.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:40:37
 That's probably what happened, I misunderstood
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:59:29
I chose Mycelium because it was the first app I learned of that allows you to set your own fee to transfer bitcoins.
I also chose to purchase with a credit card through mycelium, even though i know you can buy through gdax without paying extra. One feature through Mycelium is that they have a marketplace where users can buy and sell bitcoins directly with each other. Sellers name their price and can update it wherever or name it to the current price listed on bitstamp.

Ignore Venezuela and Zimbabwe

Not at all, no need to be toxic. I've been a part of the Bitcoin community since early 2016.
Did you even watch the video? Bitcoin can be used for good(such as crypto for homeless) and by law enforcement to catch heinous criminals such as those who distribute child pornography.
I fully believe in the power of Bitcoin and believe it should be more wide spread.
I shared the video because I thought the community should know that law enforcement can and has undermined Bitcoin's anonymity to catch those who believed they were safe.
Criminals use all sorts of currency, fiat or crypto.


Not a sound argument, is it?
@_date: 2019-10-17 01:42:27
No point, just sharing news
@_date: 2019-10-17 11:46:23
Absolutely it's a good thing
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:18:39
Missing a few digit places in terms of value
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:56:06
I just feel a little disappointed because i bought 0.8 btc 3 days ago for 3800
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:58:54
Actually it's not an overstep.
Here where I live near Dallas and in many cities across the US businesses are required to have permits in order to sell goods and are thus subjected to taxes. Because his business sidesteps city approval thus taxation, the city can give authority to police to confiscate profits to make up for not having a permit.
I know, laws can suck but unless enough people protest there is nothing that could be done to compensate for what was seized.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:37:45
The site claimed that it bought and sold bitcoins and other digital currencies similar to a trading platform.
Regardless of what it claimed to be, there were red flags that many including myself ignored. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:08:59
Thanks captain hindsight.
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:44:17
I'm based in Dallas and have been wanting to get local group together to do a meetup.
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:57:48
Did you just assume my tender?
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:03:41
Glad to hear something about ledger, the chrome extension wouldn't open for me after I loaded in about 100 dollars worth a few months back
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:03:01
No offense taken, I now know how large of a mistake it was. I wanted to share my experience in an attempt save to others from the mistake I made. That's all. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:17:24
You're right, I shouldn't be worried about small drops
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:13:46
At least I believe those have lesser fees, haven't bought through them yet cause I tied my money up for the moment
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:32:56
Yeah it sucks.. a cousin of mine told me about the company and already had a group of friends that were all in on it as well. It wasn't necessarily peer pressure, but I saw how much they talked about it for a good month or so before getting into it... so I was way too hopeful. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:29:15
Yeah I know I am, I just wanted to share my story.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:46:27
I don't know man, I was gullible as fuck and it didn't help that I had friends already in it and saying how great it was. It sounded like Bit Connect in a way and I fell for it
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:59:01
USD, I used coinbase before I learned there are exchanges with lower transaction fees ����
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:30:37
Pretty much what happened, yeah...
I'm not proud of myself but I'm restarting 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:36:38
Like I said I'm slowly building back up, I can only budget $100 a month at this point. I just can't wait until 1 satoshi equals 1 dollar ����
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:28:45
Mycelium is a peer to peer marketplace that you can find people near you that list a price that they're willing to sell at. I'm sure that there are others out there, but stay hopeful on getting up to 1 BTC! I just made a post telling my story, but stay vigilant.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:33:02
All of that is subject to tax, and with police unable to determine how much of that cash was generated by selling hot dogs, it is confiscated.
