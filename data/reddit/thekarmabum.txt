Yeah, I was at work and didn't have time to google search. That was all from mobile.

You ever buy something at the grocery store? You know how you can just scan it against the grocery store laser thingy, same concept, better technology.
EDIT: I'm not trying to sound douchey when I say "laser thingy", I just don't know what it's called.

What's the advantage to using a "cloud" wallet, or whatever coinbase's appeal is?
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:53:46
No one knows what Satoshi looks like, so I don't know how you could make a portrait of him. Also this guy just has the same name, he's not the real one.

Let me just mail you my HDD, credit card, social security number, and a list of all the illegal things I've done in the past five years.

That was a coworker that lost that much, so as a third party I'm not privy to how he would be able to recover them. It was also back when bitcoin was worth less than a dollar so at the time he didn't really care.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:50:45
Don't have the seed anymore.
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:14:45
I'll look into it, worst case scenario is I lose bitcoins that are already lost. I do still have the original encrypted wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:16:45
He was/is a hodler, so I doubt he would have sold it for any amount of currency.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:51:59
I could brute force myself, I remember no aspects, I've even tried calling an ex and be like "hey, do you remember any of the passwords I used a few years ago?" Fucking nothing.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:55:40
OS upgrade on the storage device deleted it. Also went through a crazy break up so I turned my opsec a little to high. It was a dark time in my life.
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:54:35
I think that might be the next path I go to.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:53:57
Could be worse, one of my coworkers lost 200 coins during a linux upgrade because his HDD failed during the process.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:25:25
I still can't remember my password for electrum from like 3 years ago. Yeah, I've tried to recover from a seed, I'm fucked and the bitcoins are lost.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:39:52
Dude, these bitcoins have been lost for a few years. They're in cold storage and I can't remember the password, I don't see how that's electrum's fault.
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:17:00
There's probably to much competition for a single market to control BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-03 08:20:33
Short term, maybe. Long term, the same people that made bitcoin famous will be the same ones that make petro a useless form of energy.

in short it's a DWI

I might have to buy some bitcoins on payday, had no idea they fell bellow $200 USD. good time to invest probably.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:55:47
no shit, that's all hackers ever want. I work in IT and get hit with cryptowall and cryptolocker all the time, guess what every hacker wants as ransom...
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:37:18
Spent some time inside over a D-Dub. All around, jail is a shitty situation.

You should be able to move BTC to a private wallet, I've never really had a problem with coinbase, even though they get a lot of hate on this sub.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:48:02
They do that because Chinese people tried to manipulate the market with bots and fake transactions. Mainly bots making fake transactions.
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:18:20
The USA probably won't take that deal. Puerto Rico is close to us geographically, they pretty much want to be a state, we just won't let them, and the average US citizen is generally against imperialism as it is.

Welcome to the club, I've noticed prices generally hike close to December 31.
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:42:00
I just found out the BTC I got for free years ago is currently worth $400, so I'm pretty happy about that.
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:31:30
Can't you use changetip? I'll post my address when I get home.
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:15:29
I've never had a problem with withdrawing from coinbase.
@_date: 2019-10-10 04:45:11
Shit, I remember when it was 3 cents.

We have a few in St. Louis actually.

Do I get some sort of merit badge? I have for sure kept mine longer than 5 years.
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:07:17
I'll take it, and even thank you for it.
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:18:27
hitbtc is pretty overloaded from what I understand, they are no longer accepting new customers from the US.
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:25:06
Boredom, I learned about the BTC back when I was in college and you could still mine them with your laptop. Mostly back then I used it to buy research chemicals from China, just never actually did any purchasing, held on for a few years and forgot about them until the price went from like 3 cents to like 3 grand and I was like "hey I still have a few, let's see how it plays out". Then I invested a few hundred USD into coinbase before the BTC and BCH split, sold all my BCH but kept the BTC. I thought about selling during the all time high at $20,000 but I kept them, no ragrats, still have them.
EDIT: I played around with Litecoin and other off shoots of crypto for a while, but ultimately decided to put all my eggs in the BTC basket.
@_date: 2015-08-06 01:54:41
You made me google search, look at this WTF I just found.
It's like the product was made in MS paint...
Edit: is g/s even a legit hash rate?

How did this make it past the Judiciary branch?  This is clearly not a legal law and I wait for it to get shot down in court when someone challenges it, unfortunately I'm a little guy, and don't have the funds to challenge it myself. (Nor do I live in NY, so there's a lack of caring on my part).
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:02:20
I don't, but someone I live with does. Which led me here.
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:47:00
That's awesome, I wasn't expecting anything back, thanks.
@_date: 2015-08-06 04:17:30
I may or may not have access to small/medium amounts of free electric/internet for a short period of time, I'm pretty much just dabbling right now in terms of mining.  I'm not looking to rake in millions of dollars, but if I earned a few bucks a day without much wear and tear on my machine, and learned something in the process...
I don't see how that wouldn't benefit me, and that's pretty much where I'm coming from.  You think I should look into a used ASIC?
@_date: 2015-08-05 02:01:02
I use elecrtrum and keep a back up on USB, and to I'm kinda new to BTC.

At an I.T. dude, can I ask how IPv6 is going to be introduced into the block chain? I'm still a newbie, I just want to know how other emerging technologies effect how the block chain works/will work.

Bing points are actually pretty cool, I've been using it to get free X-Box live, now I've got something else to spend them on. (No, I don't use bing for anything, just free X-Box live)

By that logic she's not tech savvy enough to hold a credit card. Not everyone knows how to ask the right questions on google.
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:15:52
I tend to buy stocks. Bitcoin is just fun for my portfolio, it usually ends up being some free money, and it's easier to convert to USD with lower transaction fees than stock. But I get residual payments from my stock four times a year so it's worth it to keep some money there.
@_date: 2015-08-03 04:11:48
Not much, they give you free points for having a Microsoft email account.
@_date: 2015-07-16 04:18:48
No, but I bet her banker did.
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:33:28
No, I got them from this username. Ironically when change tip first came out, $client got hit with cryptowall, I made a post about getting bit coin, and people just gave them to me. It was my first experience with bit coin (using someone else's money). But the ones you guys gave me, I kept for myself. This was almost a year ago.

Do you have to get a Static WAN IP from your ISP to run a node?
@_date: 2015-07-16 04:59:42
WOW!!! I just checked myself, you bitcoiners gave me over $100 over the last 8 months for absolutely no reason.  And I just realized it.
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:15:03
He should prepare his butt hole. I'd pay a cigarette and a snickers bar for that.
@_date: 2015-07-16 04:57:30
You just answered my main question, thank you. My main concern was how to do a back up, and how to pull it from any device.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:20:46
So basically, all he did was acknowledge that bitcoin exists, and that it can be used. Real page turner.
@_date: 2015-07-16 03:43:43
Would Electrum work on Win8 and Tails? I would like something where I could move coins between OS easily, not gonna fuck with apple, ever, because I work in IT, and all they ever do is piss me off. But I'm looking for something that works with a dual boot computer, and I can just store on a dedicated USB flash drive with no other files on it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 04:14:25
How much is this in Electrum? 
That's not half a bitcoin, is it?
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:40:48
I was going to say "Like wtf, I didn't make shit on BTC this month" then I saw the end....
@_date: 2016-09-13 03:07:54
I heard about BTC back in college when they were worth like barely $3 dollars. Boy do I regret some of the decisions I've made since then. My laptop used ding every once in and while and say I had mined a BTC, spent it all in the darknet markets before it was worth more than $10 a BTC
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:00:44
Maybe, everything got messed up after the Windows 10 update. At least it only has .4mBTC on it, most of my crypto is on coinbase (bad idea, I know).
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:06:02
I think it will be closer to $5-10k and end closer $50k in 2020.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:10:56
I have administrative access to Bank of America's network through my job, I don't bank with them. They outsource almost everything I.T. but the people they outsource to are all US Citizens and pretty smart, so there's that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:09:00
Yeah, my friend that introduced me to BTC back in 2012 still has his lambo....
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:30:43
I can't remember my electrum password.

There's a few of them in St. Louis, this is just one of the nicer locations.

Apple shit on TCP/IP more than MS. Remember Apple Talk? Everyone wanted their own proprietary way of doing things back then.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:34:29
I'm not a lawyer, but since bitcoin wasn't considered back during the great depression, there are currently no laws that regulate how you use your line of credit to invest. So anything done so far is a completely legal loop hole around those regulations.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:42:32
Yeah, it was risky. I didn't personally do it because I don't like using my line of credit to invest in any market, but it didn't stop other people from doing it, and they made a good chunk of money off borrowed money that they paid no interest on.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:59:21
The legality of it can be argued since the Great Depression passed laws that regulate how much you can use your line of credit to invest in the stock market. Bitcoin is just a different exchange with new legal loop holes that aren't specified in laws that were passed in the 1930's.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:21:34
I feel like bitcoin is easier to predict, which so far has meant profit for me.

Floyd Mayweather was my favorite, the guy can't even read and he hopped on the BTC wagon before most people.
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:27:10
There's enough reasonable doubt that he wasn't even the real Dread Pirate Robertson.

Never had a problem with AT&amp;T. I'm on Charter now, because of a change in location, but everything worked fine when I was using Uverse a few months ago.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:33:23
I think the scam was during the the insane highs recently, people were maxing out like $100,000 of credit card debt each month on bitcoin and then cashing out of bitcoin before it was time to pay off the card each month so they wouldn't have to pay any interest on the money they borrowed. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:00:52
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:24:04
I remember when BTC wasn't worth $3. Really wish I would have spent more time and energy on it back in college, I was an I.T. major too, so I have no excuses.

I got one within a 15 minute walk from my house, and I live in the U.S.A. woot woot.

I would if I ever planned to go into US jurisdiction. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:19:22
Me too, just think how rich we would be right now. It makes me sad, I could have retired before 30.
@_date: 2015-10-10 17:30:43
I'll be honest, I started in BTC in 2012 to buy drugs online. I don't usually have more than 5 BTC at a time, but it's a cool concept, and I see it taking over paper money soon, so I'll probably start investing a bit more.
@_date: 2015-10-09 01:33:35
Just the word "scrum" gives me nightmares of looking a job.
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:45:35
I'm pretty new to bit coin, so I'm not really sure what is going on, but isn't the whole point of this to remove "banks" or people like him?
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:48:36
RSTP? All the freaking actual routing protocols?
