Ok thx

Doesn't this security requirement make bitcoin quite centralised around the nodes that can provide it?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:29:53
I feel like if bitcoin can fix its current issues it would be the logical choice. What would be the point of creating a crypto for facebook? Why not just use fiat in that case?

Yea I have no idea what that last centence ment but thx!

Ok thx unfortunately that makes my problem off not being able to get my bitcoin **** even more confusing
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:16:03
Thx, will have to look into it!
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:52:29
Yea, just have no clue how those really work, not a programmer :-)

My point wasn't that bitcoin holds no value at all, on the contrary I actually think that it's a better version of gold because you cant sell more of it than actually exists. Was just wondering if it could ever be used as a day-to-day currency because then valuing it would be much easier.

And how exactly would one go about recovering the funds in one of these wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:43:55
Will do, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:42:50
What use is the recovery phrase in any other wallet, isn't it created by the wallet itself and is meaningless on any other platform?
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:51:44
Allright thanks for clearing that up, as I said I haven't really looked in to the specifics of the tech too much
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:39:31
Yea this seems to be a common approach, but in that case bitcoin really has no use as anything but a store of value and as such analogies like these really hold no value
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:18:54
Yea, also a lot of the information online seems to be biased in one direction or another so never know what to think :-)
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:40:34
Allright, still unclear to me though how that would work
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:39:51
Cool nice to know thx

Maybe phrased it incorrectly, I ment that if it would only be able to run on Chrome, then it would take away one of the best features off decentralized systems by giving one entity the power to shut it down from the users of the specific wallet, but thx anyways got it now
