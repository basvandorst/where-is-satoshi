Same here. I went ahead and withdrew my Bitcoin and it went through quickly. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:45:01
It was only a few hours for me. I might have lucked out on the timing though.

No man, [This]( shit's Cray.

An in person purchase with cash might be easiest... See if there's anyone near you on localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:41:23
You can send them all to me... That'll remove the ties between you and those coins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:54
wait, tipbot works with "internets" as a currency... lol
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:43:19
Advertising dollars/coins.

yeah it could be to some. but a similar argument could be made for people using just webmail, and Gmail will ask to register itself as a service handler. I'm assuming something similar could be done in an online wallet but the responsibility is on the wallet site to add that functionality.
I'm not a fan of online wallets myself and will use this space to recommend that people use at least a local client.

Yeah, the improvement proposal gave a very strong indication that any client should register itself as a handler. The problem I saw was it seemed that most websites I run across w/ addresses on them aren't linking it. Especially ones with donation addresses on the side or bottom.

Well the first one (MtGox) shutdown all trading earlier in the day. Other exchanges kept going and their prices are just reflecting what the traders on those exchanges are wanting to pay.

Browsers technically support it already. If you click on a Bitcoin link it will open in a desktop client of your choice. Right now it gives you a warning that it's going to open an external application (your Bitcoin client) to handle your request. This will basically get rid of that warning.

The only thing I would add is to make sure your phone has a password or pattern that's needed to unlock it. You just want to think about what happens if your phone is lost or stolen.
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:40:12
Currently the first time you click on a "bitcoin:" link your browser gives you a warning that's it's going to launch an external application to handle the request. Granted you can click the option to ignore them in the future. My understanding is whitelisting the URI scheme won't give you that warning. A small benefit and not the only one, but it's nice...
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:29:01
There's always the option of going back and reading everything. On the Internet, nothing dies...

Here's a pretty good list along with some high level overview of each

Nice try, but I'm guessing as far as the IRS is concerned those are the same thing. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:22:13
I just looked and it was still wrong for other alt-coins...
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:38:05
The first time you click on a Bitcoin link now it should give you a warning that it's going to launch an external application to handle your request. Right now you would usually just check the box that says "I'm cool with this" and it will not show up again. This change will theoretically do away with that warning.
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:18:41
you can always do work and accept payment in Bitcoin. There's some websites out there, but try as a starting place.

That will really depend on the whatever GPU the OP has. For Example, I was playing around running my Radeon 6850 and came up with ~0.01+ BTC/day. That is an entry level gaming card and I know it's not ideal, like I said, I was just playing around.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:45:44
That's awesome... love the name :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:17:03
or use it to pay the electric bill...
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:14:28
It must be fairly sporadic because it's been working like I would think it should if it's running or not. running v0.8.1-beta
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:39:55
It doesn't make an obligation for the browser to support anything, we're already in that boat.
The issue you mention seems to be a known sporadic bug in Bitcoin-qt.

You must not live in a small town. This is me getting pulled over in High School.
Me: "Good evening officer."
Police: "You been drinking?"
Me: "No Sir."
Police: "Who's boy are you?"
Me: "..."

I think the biggest reason is that Btc-e is much smaller in terms of volume than Gox. So it just takes a few min for Btc-e to "Catch up."

Automatic upvote for a curious noob...
To better answer the question though, There's no good way to really determine the difference between coins that are "lost" and ones that are in long term storage situation. There's some other measures that try to compensate for that, but I can't remember and to lazy to find what they're called right now...
@_date: 2013-04-17 04:14:54
TipBot should start putting little quips like this when you have it verify.
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:16:10
Yeah, I ended up getting those too on the Bitcoin wiki. That might have been purposely done so no one accidently send coins to those addresses. I tried on my page and just now on Gary's page below (without sending) and they worked.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:00:16
yeah... I put in the headline and went back to read the article...

Try finding a seller on  since the sellers are individuals there is a better option they will accept Paypal. I'm not sure about any in Canada since I'm in the US.

TO THE MATH!!! 23.4k to ~15k over 4 days gives us a reduction of ~2.1k per day (2,115). So, assuming that rate stays about the same coming in at 18,500 would give you ~8.75 days till they get to you.

"Offline" being a wallet that doesn't live on a website, probably on your computer. Try the official client here 
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:53:25
I was wondering this same thing earlier. I couldn't find one from my looking around.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:05:38
Unless I'm mistaken, you can't "ping" a P2P network and by the nature of them you might as well just have a static report that it's up. I guess you could add a footnote that says something along the lines of "Not applicable in case of global thermonuclear war."
