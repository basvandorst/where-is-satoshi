I'm fairly new to cryptos as well. I consider myself like a week of research ahead of you (not much). I would recommend you read the Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. It provides with a clearer picture of how (but more importantly WHY) bitcoin and blockchain startups are designed in such a way.

That's a great way of seeing it! Hadn't thought of it that way

In my case I'm hodling btc, but it really depends on how the future looks like if I'm cashing out to fiat or buying a lambo in the moon with btc. 
Jokes aside, I do believe it is a healthy cycle by itself without merchants (fiat to btc and viceversa). If there is more demand for btc, the price goes up. 
Using bitcoin as a payment method would increase the adoption rate but I don't think it's imprescindible.
One thing that doesn't make sense to me to spend bitcoin on stores is the transaction fee. As a commerce or as a buyer that detracts from the overall experience. It's not the type of experience that will create mainstream adoption. 
In my opinion, whoever gets the lowest fees and the most seamless experience will win the adoption. Similar to what happened with Nokia, Blackberry and Apple.

So the centralization of power comes from the decision making process from the parties involved in the NYA? Which shouldn't be that way because it doesn't take into account the community.

How does a block size increase give so much power to individuals/ corporations? What is it that I'm not understanding yet ?

Do you guys think bitcoin will stay ahead even if the core team takes time to make decisions? I feel like bitcoin can be the Altavista of crypto (that was the first search engine I knew). If there's a team solving problems faster, wouldn't they eventually catch up and pass bitcoin? (Fairly new to the cryptoworld and pretty excited to be able to participate)

This is what I believe as well. If 2x has relatively low right now support, their price should tank. (Maybe I only browse Pro BT1 websites, but this is my current belief.)
