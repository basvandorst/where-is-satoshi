Idiot.. don't risk families future on crypto, buy the house now, 5% down (for first time home owner) and get 20 year conventional loan

Very fair points, thanks for feedback

I still don’t get it..  why is this better than current options? It’s not even faster than debit/ credit card or cash for that matter 
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:31:45
Okay that’s all good, but once this becomes a certain size isn’t it likely that the gov is going to step in to regulate and we are right back to the way it is now.. if they start to regulate that would require a middle man correct? Middle man would require fees.. Please explain why it is not possible for this to happen and you might have created a crypto fan

True but fraud is way bigger deal on your debit card, effects account balance immediately, tying up funds, maybe over drafting accounts, and if you don't catch it right away you're screwed 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:15:14
Case by case basis, the point is.. when you are using money online or traveling you want to use a credit card because if you get scammed it is much more likely to get money back

Not always, if you catch it within 2 days your max liability with a debit card is $50 if you don't catch it for 60 days you are SOL [debit cards vs credit cards ](

Hacked bro.. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:28:18
People want to use credit cards because if they get scammed they can make a claim with the credit card company.. can't do that "as easy" with a debit card
