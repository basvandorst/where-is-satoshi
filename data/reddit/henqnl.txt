I can understand that (for example) banks could set up a closed group distrubuted ledger between them. But what would be the advantage over a replicated [traditional rdbms (sql) with some digital signing glued on top](

Satoshi Nakamoto settled on a target time of 10 minutes per block with an initial subsidy of 50 BTC set to halve once every 4 years.
4 years / 10 minutes ≈ 210 000
50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + ... = 100
210 000 * 100 = 21 million

I have calculated money inflow as follows:
Inflow per day = average price x bitcoins mined per day (7200 before Nov 27, 3600 onwards). 
Of course this neglects the many bitcoin hoarded by miners to sell later.  But it gives a minimal estimate, I think, of money inflow. 
The total money inflow is about $ 600 million (line 933), the market cap stands at about 7 billion, so more than 10x as high.

yes, on purpose. i think if you analyze year-over-year growth, log scale gives a better impression.  (of course, you also need to see the linear scale chart to provide context).

Gold Stock-To-Flow Ratio
The greatest misunderstanding in the gold sector
There is a clear difference between commodities, which can be explained by a consumption model (e.g. crude oil, copper, agricultural commodities) and goods that are bought in order to be held (gold, diamonds, works of art). While the economic utility of a consumable good is created when it is destroyed or used up, the utility of investment assets lies in their possession and later resale. Industrial commodities therefore have low stock-to-flow ratios, this is to say, inventories usually only cover consumption demand for a few months. If there were no inventories at all, supply would have to correspond exactly to production and demand exactly to consumption. However, if there are inventories, consumption can temporarily exceed production. Since inventories of consumable commodities are as a rule very low, prices will rise quickly in anticipation of a future supply shortage and bring consumption into balance with production.
Unlike consumable commodities, gold and silver exhibit a large discrepancy between annual production and the total available supply which is a high stock-to-flow ratio. It is our premise that the high stock-to-flow ratio represents the most important characteristic of gold (and silver). The entire amount of gold ever mined totals approximately 172,000 tons. That is the stock. Annual production was about 2,700 tons as of 2012. That is the flow. If one divides the two amounts, one arrives at the stock-to-flow ratio of currently 64 years.
Gold isn’t as valuable because it is so rare, but quite the opposite: Gold is valued so highly because annual production relative to the existing stock is so small. Putting it differently: not only scarcity, but primarily the relative constancy of the available stock is what makes gold unique. The annual production of 2,700 tons is therefore not relevant to price determination. This characteristic was attained over centuries and can no longer be altered. This stability and security is a crucial precondition for creating confidence.
source: 
Gold has a StFR of about 80 and that will slowly increase with time/stock. Bitcoin's flow is reducing fast (the coinbase 'mining reward' is halved each 4 years), making the StFR of Bitcoin increasing fast, will overtake that of gold in less than 10 years from now.

When you print a card with an address and give those away, others see you transaction history. Better use payment codes.  (But only Samourai Wallet on Android supports those, a little drawback...)

Another argument: say, in normal times with 5% interest on a savings bank account. Were people postponing buying things because "Hey, in a year's time I can buy 5% more stuff" ?   Nah.  
[Or, deflation 5% has same wealth effect as 5% interest on savings]

You miss the point zoopz. The criminal milieu can continue to accept the 500 eu notes *among themselves*.  Just like the Swiss Dinar in Iraq. A closed loop. The Swiss Dinar could not be exchanged at any bank in Iraq but nonetheless local people continued to use it for trade for a decade...  There must be enough points to go in and out of the 500 eu circuit, like the usual betting offices, massage parlours and so on, where you can exchange the 500 eu notes for smaller notes and back.  But that will self organize.

Me thinks that if you are shown the first (say) 5 and last 5 chars, this is good enough for a copy-paste verify. Like:

If I were advisor to the professional criminal guild (disclaimer:  I am not), I'd advise to keep using the 500 Euro note. The supply of new notes will be stopped and the number of notes will quickly dwindle as most notes will be brought to the banks.  I assume the EU laws will still make it a crime to counterfeit new 500 Euro notes, even if they are no longer official legal tender.  Think about it: the 500 Euro note will become a bit like a paper version of Bitcoin.  Even now 500 Euro notes allegedly trade above par in the criminal circuit.  The price could skyrocket, based on (shrinking) stock and demand and trust.
Silly?  In Iraq the "Swiss Dinar", the last notes made under Saddam Hussein reign, were more popular than the new money introduced after the US invasion. They were used for trade because (a) people trusted there were no counterfeits, as the Swiss printer did a very good job at making difficult to reproduce marks and (b) the new money was suspected to have considerable inflation. Wikipedia: 
500 Euro notes?  Get you some, they might become very valuable... ;-)

Volatility decreased from 800..600 in June 2011 hype period to 500 in April 2013 hype to 300 just recently, China-hype.
See chart 
Also note that the amount of money needed to cause these (diminishing) price swings increased enourmous. In June 2011 thousands of dollars could cause a large fluctuations. In April this year transfers of 20..40 mio dollar (circled) made the price jump less and just last week 40..70 mio dollar moved the price up and down by even less %.
