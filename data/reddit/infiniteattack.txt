Someone said the withdrawal fee is $30, is that for selling bitcoin or removing "credit" to your bank account? 
Edit:Also, the e-transfer fee is 5%, kind of high, no?

I read it has 5% buying fee and $30 withdraw fee.

How much did you lose?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:33:04
You use GDAX? Are you using bots? How do you setup orders?
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:11:40
No fees for withdrawing. I use QuadrigaCX.

But this 
says it takes a day to deposit and 2 to withdraw?

Day trading even worth it? What exchange has most and least bots?

I don't want to trade to other coins, I want to buy and sell just bitcoin. How do those fees apply to me?
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:05:29
Transfer to exchange and then sell.
