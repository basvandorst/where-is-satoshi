I hear peopl say "cashay"
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:07:45
What purpose?

Right... Raping children doesn't violate the nap at all. You got me on that one. Genius philosopher you are.

I tried looking for an argument underneath all that ad hominem, but there were none to be found. Sad.

If the government is the only thing stopping you from raping your daughter you've got bigger problems than politics

Does this apply to TigerDirect.ca as well?

All fiat currencies inevitably end. Bitcoin is far more solid a store of value in the very long term. But that could be a while off.

"You have all the knowledge and skills then that you have now."
It would be more of a "re-invention" than a true invention. You as the time traveler would be more capable of inventing it than satoshi himself considering he still had another 4 years to go, technically all you would have to do is invest some capital in hiring some cryptographers and programmers to get it off the ground. Then I don't see any reason why it wouldn't end up doing almost exactly what bitcoin has done since, just sooner.
Thinking up bitcoin all by yourself when nothing like that has ever been done before like Satoshi did, that would be hard. But knowing exactly what he did and simply replicating his initial process is fairly elementary. It's actually a key part of his invention,  he WANTED it to be replicable and thats a big reason why crypto is so durable.

So are the stores receiving actual BTC or is it being converted to fiat automatically upon payment?

Ok this makes me think I'm misunderstanding the fees aspect of Bitcoin. Doesnt each transaction cost about 20$ in bitcoin? So if you buy a game on steam with bitcoin doesnt that work out to about a 20$ premium? What am I missing here?

I see no reason why an trusted intermediary such as coinbase could not be used. It would make the involved bitcoin slightly less secure but its not like your going to be spending millions at a time at a mall, but if you ARE, just be prepared to wait ten minutes, or put down some kind of collateral.

is this actually a thing?

What if I'm looking to buy with CAD?

Thanks for the response, this is the kind of thing I need to hear.
Approaching 30, have my high school but can't decide on what to do with my life so I've just been working in kitchens mostly, stagnating. Recently discovered appreciation for the art of saving which is why I have 2k instead of -2k.
I also have 9yo son I see on the weekends and pay child support for so I only save about $100 per paycheck.
Most people would bow out of attempt to advise me at this point and I understand if you do the same. I'm getting to the point where I'm thinking I may need to give up on finding something I enjoy and just pick something based on the money and hours so I can still see my kid but also be able to financially provide for him a bit better.
Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Don't be gentle if you don't want to be. I usually prefer brutal honesty anyway.

This sounds like good advice but I have no investments other than crypto, I'm young, dumb, and full of spunk. How should I determine my "max allocation to crypto" when all I have is about 2000 bucks to my name, $1000 in crypto (mostly bitcoin) and a nintendo switch?
Currently my plan is to just hold the crypto almost indefinitely while adding to it where I can over time. Not much of a plan I know but it is better than most of my friends'! ��������������
