How this 'elaborate' scam works? Dude. This is the most default of bitcoin scams... 
'Hello sir send me ur internet monies and without doing anything I'll make u millions'
It doesn't even sound plausible, just some pretty words and magic terms and, bang, anyone who has no knowledge about this all just buys btc and/or sends them to those people. 
If they can make you 'invest' 5K in btc I'd say it's worth a 3 hour talk.
If he can talk to 50 people in the meantime that's a potential 250K in 3 hours. Might change your perspective about him doing it wrong ^^
It might also just be a pyramid scheme, where they pay out half the people who invest to get validated and then run off with the rest of the money. 
It's really not rocket science tbh, just lame ass good ol' callcenter scammers.

Eeehmmmm guise.
Why is he ranting against coinomi about his 70K?
Granted, sending the passphrase to Google plaintext isn't really secure, it would still require a MITM attack to catch this string. 
Finally, I think the option they gave him is a pretty solid one? What does he expect?
"Hurdur ur app is not secure, i lost 70K because of you, gimme back".
Coinomi has no way of knowing if maybe he has keyloggers and shit installed, which might be a pretty valid way to get your bitcoins stolen...

How the heck can one btc be equal to 5M USD for localbitcoin when the course is at 4K atm?
Legit question, can anyone explain?

Not talking about the App, but any machine he has ever used to log into that wallet, or any machine he has ever used the same passphrase can have a keylogger installed and can be the cause of the passphrase leaking. 
Just because something's transmitted in plaintext doesn't necessarily mean that it gets stolen by transmitting it in plaintext, the user might've been compromised before it got transmitted, or after and the cause of the compromise wont be clear.
But yes, I agree with the idiotic implementation and staying away from closed source.
I just don't see an immediate and defining correlation between his phrase being sent in plaintext and his bitcoins being stolen.
There's 1000's of ways his pass could've leaked.

Valid point.


I think that assumption falls in the same category as assuming Google is safe in handling this info.
So yeah, I agree to agree with you in stating there's more than 1 way it could've leaked. 
But still this doesn't feel like Coinomi's responsibility to me... 
At least not in a way that it can be clearly indicated that "Because you did that, this happened". 
I feel like he's banging up the wrong door.
