Bitwala stole my money which was transfered from wavecrest to their bank account. I live outside EU so my card was closed few months ago, and until this time bitwala ignores my emails. They are scammers, be aware!!!

Thank you, guys. My issue was solved.
Magickly I tried to withdraw again, even I see withdrawals suspended- systems allowed me to did this. And my money already arrived in a cold wallet. 
I hope that was just some system error on the bitfinex side.

I just wait a moment when in 20 years some one create collage with such posts, so people can see evolution of bitcoin,  how it became currency of the world.

But who backed gold?
I know answer- no one backed it. It just has some value for people. Bitcoin it is just better version of gold. Gold 2.0
Bitcoin don't need to be a "currency" because it just better

 &gt;&gt;but all log-ins have to be authorized by me for blockchain, so if he tries to get in I can deny it.
He can withdraw money by using seed words , so no needs for him to login to "Blockchain site"

I think instead of this we should move US somewhere ...
Crypto should be free from any goverments, fbi, etc. In case some of them steal money from users we should block that accounts(do hard fork) and only in that case. We should do same what they do against us.

After I pressed split button on my ledger nano my accounts showed as empty in all chains. Only 'reset application data' helped me.

I am alive)) but I lost my BTC at btc-e so yes I am mad..(
@_date: 2019-10-10 20:27:59
for me it takes only 10 seconds after I read your your comment
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:45:05
It is better to buy more as much and  as fast as possible because every next dip will cost you much expensive
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:08:18
What is wrong with you man? did you lose a lot of money or just had a bad mood and decided to spread it here?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:48:21
Don't listen this guy, 99% should go to BTC and 1% to altcoins . Why 1% and not 0%, just to be able to learn on own mistakes
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:07:16
In that case It will be very expensive mistake

I moved to bitfinex. I was shocked on how exchange should work, orders get submitted before my finger release the mouse button. Kraken not deserve to exist any longer.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:07:04
Withdrawals and deposits are now disabled??!!
@_date: 2019-02-18 10:13:05
20 minutes about nothing....
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:02:16
Can you imagine how poor is their code quality. Site throws random error for any action. But that not worst, the worst thing is too see empty error message, or get error that order not accepted but it was accepted , you than try to resubmit it, but wait you already submitted few of thems, and some of thems already executed, abd you want to cancel those which left, ah wait you can't, because of that stupid errors. What a pain. Thank you bitfinex developers you are the best.

I experience exactly same issue, sent them documents at least 4 times during time when I used it. They froze my bitcoins even when they card stopped towork, so there was no reason to do this as it is no possible to launder money in company which doesn't work with fiat. That was their own initiative , probably they are looking for a way to not return you your money. Crappy company . I do not recommend this company it will freeze your account 100% 
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:11:04
 fuck people if you want fuck 
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:30:11
It can and it will, believe me
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:13:27
Same here...
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:19:43
True bitcoin price fir now is 1100$ not more...so it better to buy below it to get better profit in future. This drop to 2k is just beginning (look at 2013)
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:40:16
Btc-e.com is a solution at least for me
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:51:18
Because tether same shit with verification process as any other exchanges(except btc-e)?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:13:00

@_date: 2018-12-08 00:12:40
