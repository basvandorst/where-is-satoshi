It's probably going 8k based on what?

I don't think you're getting downvoted because you're telling him to hold, that is pretty much the mantra of any and every crypto related forum.
But telling anyone what's going to happen with the price is just stupid. You may be right, but it would still be because of luck, not because you know it's going to happen. Nobody knows what the price will be next week or even tomorrow, anyone who claims they know should: 1. Not be given attention and 2. Be told how stupid they are to think they know.

If it stays purely speculative, what is its value and what will make it stabilize? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:32:00
You bought at the right time!
Edit: Also isn't BTC supposed to be a store of value?
Edit2: Pizza is value, right?
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:07:30
Nope, not irony, but it will be a solid point by years end.
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:55:51
Oh, bet you regret that hesitation!
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:26:53
Nobody knows about economics. Some are familiar with crumbs of it, but the second someone claims they *know* something, they're liars.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:25:59
Not that hard, just HODL.

"Even predict gambling". 
Said like that is the hardest possible math problem you could even fathom.

Can you clarify why coinbase is an exchange and not a trading platform? Also not trying to be dick.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:13:19
I think I may have experienced history's most expensive acid bad trip.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:18:46
I fail to see the relevance to Bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:49:36
What a time to be alive!
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:28:56
I never implied it was.
Edit: A gram og acid would be HOLY FUCK so much.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:09:20
Rather having less manual labour and more accessible high calorie food is the culprit.
That said you can still be blamed for being fat, imo.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:58:06
To be fair, everyone's a winner until they're not.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:48:05
At that point it has to be practically cash though, right? In the sense that it would be valid payment anywhere?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:25:09

Most people on all sides in all camps should realise we are in new territory. There is *rarely* going to be only one answer.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:33:52
You're right, that might be the issue right there.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:50:19
Many coins seem to have a almost cult-like following, where everyone not as all in in the coin/camp they're in are 'un wokened morons'
It's the same thing in almost any coin specific sub, everyone has unlimited faith in their coin and its going to be nr one and moon and everyone else will feels bad they didn't buy in.

Finland for Finns type political party? Does he do these gestures a lot?
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:39:53
Because it's harder to hack a piece of paper than your computer.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:51:53
If the dollar is worth less, how does fees having higher value make sense? Maybe I'm misunderstanding you though.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:27:30
But that doesn't make it more valuable, because the dollar is less valuable. It *does* however make it more valuable compared to USD.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:23:18
You aren't touching the point though. The fee being more USD does not mean that it is becoming more expensive. Without other considerations, the only thing it means is that the value of USD measured to bitcoin is lower.

Guessing a number between 1 and 5 will statistically leave ypu with the right number 1 in 5 times. That's absolutely no feat.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:05:39
I can't tell how many times I've seen this gif, but it gets better every time.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:07:49
Unexpectedly fitting loop.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:48:05
I didn't buy last week, so probably that.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:54:31
You completely miss the point. It's dumb luck you twat.
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:35:38
I had a dream like this. I then woke up and remembered how I didn't buy at 800$
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:03:47
I absolutely believe both are true. No one sub is holding a high standard for tolerance than the other as I see it. And users are just as shitty on both sides, but going trolling on either sub makes you the biggest shit imo, and should have you banned, bo matter what sub your fucking around at.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:00:35
I actually hold neither, I just think it's sad that open discussion is being held back. Both sides seem to just be throwing dung at each other and calling each other stupid for having different views. Nothing good will come of it, ever.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:07:16
Funny enough, the three letter subreddit says the exact same thing about *this* subreddit.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:31:15
Makes you think of something. Don't know what it is, but it sure is something.
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:12:04
Something, something he who controls the present.
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:26:39
Would you say you *like* the D?
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:09:30
Cool, I'm only really interested if there's btc involved, personally. ^^^^Seriously
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:10:28
Not convinced of conspiracy to murder, so there's not really enough evidence to claim he did. He definitely committed crimes though, but imo, definitely not *two* lifetime sentences worth.
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:18:55
Mining *BTC* is not profitable, even if you have free electricity.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:41:05
You my friend just solved the worlds food problems. Exept now potato prices fluctuate with +/- 400 dollars a day.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:13:01
You expect btc to be more than 9999.99 'very soon'? That sounds pretty optimistic!
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:34:21
It could potentially force a hard fork though, right? Which is what OP probably is on about.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:06:18
If anyone ever gets those bets right, it's an educated bet *at best*, but it's fucking hard to block them out either way.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:32:02
Educated about what exactly?
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:24:28
Just don't put all your eggs in one basket!
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:20:15
I think bitcoin has massive potential, but not as currency, *necessarily*.
