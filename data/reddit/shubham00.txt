Before picking any order please copy that btc and paste to google to check how much bitcoins you will get for example, I pick a order worth $11 with effective rate of $498/btc (when btc value is $420/btc), after clicking that order I see that I will get 0.02208314 btc which is $9.28 as per current rate so that I am losing $1.72. To get best rate always choose order at top and always choose order which has effective rate less than $500/btc.

Do you need bitcoin wallet to store those bitcoins?if yes use coinbase its good wallet to store,buy sell bitcoins enable all security of your wallet so it will become nearly unhackable.So as you are new to bitcoins Please note following things:
Pros:1)Bitcoins are well known for its volatility and investment itselffor example:last month it was at $270/btc but after few weeks it reaches to its peak value at $490/btc.
2)Spending bitcoins to buy on amazon can save your money by using sites like PurseIO (5%-30% off on any item).
Cons: 1) Its volatilty can also become your foe for example as I said it was $490/btc it fals down after few days to $320/btc,so its nearly unpredictable.
2) You have to sell them as it reaches higher price and keep eye on its prices.
Btw even its price drop suddenly you can still make profit by storing it so patience is key to overcome its con.

I will advice you to save them instead of losing too much money (as bitcoin prices dropped to 311 usd/btc) but dont worry just do your daily work and keep eye on btc chart,it will increase again until next week or next month.But lose hope
