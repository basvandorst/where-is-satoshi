Too bad these few dozen servers can only be used to send IOUs that require trusting the issuer of the IOU.

Of course it is.  An admission is exactly what it is.


Mastercard just admitted that cryptocurrencies could place them at a competitive disadvantage, and some people may choose to use cryptocurrencies instead of Mastercard.  This is the opposite of the party line that Bitcoin 'is a solution without a problem' and similar public statements from banking execs.  It's the [opposite of what a Mastercard spokesman recently claimed](  He said "it's hard to understand what the appeal is of a cryptocurrency is when it's essentially electonifying cash, it seems to be pretty inefficient...".  If it's so hard to see the appeal of cryptocurrency, why does Mastercard's filing warn that it might put them at a competitive disadvantage?

Bitcoin cuts out the 'trusted third party' bank or company.  In a Bitcoin transaction, there are only two parties:  the sender and the receiver.  A third party, like Mastercard, is not required as long as both the sender and the receiver are speaking the Bitcoin protocol.
Because of this, companies like Mastercard (or IBM) can never provide the advantages of Bitcoin, because their entire role is eliminated from the payment process.

All you have to do is trust your gateway to have 100% reserves, and then trust the gateway to redeem your IOUs for the actual asset on demand.
