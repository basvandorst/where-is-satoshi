Go to bitcointalk.org there you can find all the info you need. Also, localbitcoin, coinbase are good starting points. To store your funds go for the Ledger. Is a hardware wallet. You can also go and look for more information.
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:39:18
It could be, but is a good starting point if you want to buy BTC same with LocalBitcoin. If you want btc you can buy them there and if you don't trust them just send them to a ledger or a coldwallet of your own. Paxful is another that can get you BTC.

Thank god you added the "valid" word. Because satoshis make a new protocol and make the 21million cap because 180 billions btcs were created(no one knows what happened to them)  but i hope they can't flow into the chain again.

One thing is bank elites being dethroned other thing is government. Bitcoin can work hand to hand with government. But we need first to fuck up all banks tentacles in every government. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 15:52:32
It will always go through. Lower fees make transactions slower(From 20 to 60 minutes). I always use 0.0005 btcs as fee. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:53:04
I think is pretty ok, but a transactions is not a block. There are several thousands of transactions in a single block
@_date: 2018-10-23 00:59:58
It could be a block taken for a solo miner?

Yes. Electrum is a great wallet. Make sure to write down your private keys so you dont lose your wallet. If you want to send BTCs just send to other wallets. Transaxtion speeds depends on fees. Bigger fees, fastest transactions.

Yes it can drop is called correction. We are in the healthy pad to 20k again. 
And yes, etf means open doors for institunional money meanjng that i as a btc owner will sell btc to institutions for a price not lower than 20k. Wanna watch the mayhem. Just sit back and relax

Remember that each bet resets your statistics. No body takes that in account. And think is like IRL that 1/1000 this happens. In Dice is 1/1000 but per bet. Stopped playing when i realized that is more difficult to win on cryptos than betting a horse.

See ya.
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:50:25
Wasted 10 minutes of my life for this?
You can't create a wallet that has been used and have funds.
Downloading bitcoincore is not essential to use bitcoin
Creating wallet service that accepts CC will lead you to scams.
He says that people scam and steal btcs.little did he knows the billions that the economic system lose every day.
He says he works with forex. Little did he know that Amazon sank 90% for 2 years and now look at it. I can keep going and going... 
Also before you continue to spread fud. Watch this article.

Omg. For real they are shutting down voices of progression? Wtf is this.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:50:16
Well there are billions in fiat that are being stolen every single day and you still use it. You use a bank account that isn't secure enough. It depends on you. I agree that people should be educated about blockchain. About the miners though i mined till last year. Of course it is profitable if you invest 20k and wait 2 years also electricity cost was under control since i lived in Venezuela and the monthly bill won't exceed 1$.
Me commenting about amazon is because you say "my experience told me that when something touch a dip it ain't it dip and its going down" i just used as example amazon or i can even use Apple as a example. New techs always go through this. Bitcoin price could go over 1million $ from here to 2 years. Metcalfe's law. 
I'm not telling you to trust BTC since this down is to disappear weak hands, people that only got in for the money and not the tech. 
Tell JP morgan that they fucked up. When they bough 70mill+ that we know of worth of btc. Same with goldman Sachs. Even Elon Musk grabbed some. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:05:36
Between 10-15k is the typical amount. It can take 30min to 2 hours depends on block demand. But yes you can set them as high as you want to make it quick. 50k sats for a withdrawal it won't take longer than 10-15min but also depends on block demand. Download mycelium there you have a fee index to play with.

Lol. DONT USE REMESAS. People that keeps using Government mechanics to get their fiat in Venezuela are the same ones that are fucking up the country. 
Use localbitcoins since there NO way to have a problem. I've been using it since 2014 in venezuela and put of venezuela. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:24:54
Lo hacen, antiguamente no recuerdo la pagina de cambio cono localbitcoin pero venezolana. Hay bofs vendiendo miles de btcs o habian, busccare a ver.

Ma' man. You right. Hail Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:15:31
Dunno. Hard to know with out knowing your incoming transactions and where they came from. Is pretty impossible that your bitcoins are dirty btcs since i don't believe you were to dumb to don't clean them up if you were doing nasty shit. If not, some how your KYC went wrong at some point or still in process. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:29:43
Blockchain has no owner. Just faces for development purposes. If you lost your keys, your pin or 2fa or whatever security related. You just lost all your BTCs. You just need the private key and if you put a PIN to it. Then you are screwed. No one can help you, theres no way to recover private keys or the P/w of such private key.
@_date: 2018-11-06 22:03:54
Yes i vaulted a lot of btcs there and used the debit card. I still have some spare btc there but i think i moving all to the ledger.

Well you can send me that information through PM. Also never sell or buy with out an escrow service(no matter who is buying or selling) kf they pretended to wired transfer, there should be a transfer id, a transfer number,- there should be e-mails with the supposedly wire transfer. Do you kmow you can sue them of many things. Also a wired transfer can take up to 15 days or more. The fastest one i got was 3 days of waiting. Longest one was 12 days. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:15:25
More than 40% of those btc are government related. It makes me sick that people talk about bitcoin in Venezuela like it was used by the common person and it isn't.(Soy venezolano, me cayó el FAE en CCS y me decomisaron 45 maquinas y aparte 25k$ en btcs. Si no daba nada y hablaba sabes muy bien que me iba a suceder, meses despues me volvieron a caer en Lecheria, Edo Anzoategui y me decomisaron 12 maquinas mas, esta vez fue el SEBIN. Un amigo cercano de Maturin muy unido a los rojitos me ma do fotos de galpones de el gobierno con miles de ASICs y RIGs produciendo para ellos)
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:10:33
The program you used to mine them should have a .cfg file where your BTC address is. Look for that address. If you found it, you should also look for your private key which I'm assuming you don't have. If that the case then you can't recover your bitcoins. If you find the address you can look it up  at blockchain.info and cry if you have a good stack or even 1BTC. If you have your private key. Tell me and I'll try to guide you to recover your btcs.
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:32:37

Go to blockchain.info and watch blocks. If you ever mined you will now the block reward. If you want to see the quantity of btcs you have to hack the blockchain have acces to every wallet and see it. So stop making shit statements when everything you need to know how many btcs are, is there.
If you are asking this because you saw or so.eone tolds you that there are many more btcs out of the chain. Just stop. Nakamoto did the supply 21mill first 50btcs mined went to his wallet which haven't move in 10 years. 
 
Aslo you got your answer and still ask if that is true. 
Is like asking "why are we here" who the fucks know but we are here. 
There are 17500000 btc because all the info gathered to this day from the blockchain, says so. There are more? Who the fucks know but there are 17500000.
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:29:12
Because it depends on Blocks. Each blocks give you right now 12.5BTCS it started with 50BTCs per block but each 210.000 Blocks gets halved. 
First 210.000 blocks x 50btcs = 10500000
Second 210.000 blocks x 25 btcs =  5250000
140853 blocks x12.5 btcs = 1760662
Total= 17510662.5 BTCS 
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:21:46

Or if you sell to them while btc was higher than it is right now. I suppose that could be their problem, wich also is not your problem. They shouldn't buy btc if they are not willing to lose at sometimes. Also take a read of their ULA to see if they say something about the shit is happening to you. Wosh you the best mate, keep this updated on your case. Now im thinking on stop my use on Xapo. Also verify you contacted the real Xapos support and buyers(since this ecosystem is full of scammy scumbags)
@_date: 2019-01-31 03:43:24
Why would yo do that? Just download PC wallets. Wich are almost all the same as Android ones. (Almost all wallets have PC/MAC/IOS/ANDROID)

Well is pretty weird to actually see and old bitcoin owner (500+btc) not being cautious. Is have been years since we started to see how vulnerables we are because we didn't knew that BTC will explode so soon(2014-2015) but it did. I have like 20+ emails, reddits, twitter, etc. Sometimes i log in on my old accounts from diferent ISPs(no vpn just other isp, or a cracked wifi, etc. But yeah keep telling people to stop being chill thinking they are save on the internet. I think the darkweb is safer than google so...
