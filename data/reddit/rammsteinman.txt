Especially since John is right.

Sure. Things may be priced 3% higher, but I don't pay $35 for a $10 pizza. I can also pay with cash. 
I'm not saying zero transaction fees, but this is ridiculous.

It's also accepted by everyone without transaction fees (cash anyway). 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:15:34
No I'm not.

And for the people that do accept bitcoin it's too expensive to transfer money into it (from fiat or alt coins) and then pay them without $50 in fees.

Well you are backed by your credit and equity. You can use this to get cash monies and buy bitcoin (which is backed by nothing). If you fuck  up and don't pay it back, you can lose your equity and credit. Sames goes for a country, except it prints its own money instead of using some world currency (which some would argue is USD).

It's different if no one buys and everyone sells. It's the same if eventually more people buy than sell. 
You're predicting people, not Bitcoin value.

I don't pay a transaction fee when taking cash out of my bank. Visa there are transaction fees but they merchant eats them (I even get cash back), but comparatively they are tiny compared to Bitcoin fees on small transaction.

Barf, puke, whateva!

Technically it could go down just by list price (sell orders). 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:58:17
Hodl your coin so you don't bring it down more when you sell!! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:56:45
If it hits $1 I'd use it because the transaction fees would be reasonable again.

I find it hard to believe that anyone would be this stupid. Especially people who could get a mortgage.

You're still paying those if you pay in bitcoin, plus the network transaction fee. What's your point?
