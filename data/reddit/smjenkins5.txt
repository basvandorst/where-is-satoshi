Audley End has never been the same since your grandfather allowed young Harold Faltermeyer II the run of the place. Between failing to pay Capability Brown's grandson his dues, and allowing the ha-ha walls to fall into ruin, he had the misbegotten ill-wits to hand the reins to you. His only son, the ruin of the estate, with your life-size scalextrics in the great hall, let alone your tiger fetish and 'mishaps' with rifle and nursey. The scandals have seen the death of the great lineage. The walls are crumbling, young scion.

How's Nursey treating you, old skunk?

Is Pumpland near Flatland? Or the Bartman Isles?

You know that it would be untrue

I love seeing the price resemble my erection like this

Good grief. All of you who are currently panicking, just go back and look at the historic price chart. For example, take a look at what happened in May-August 2016. Recoveries are bumpy, and especially so when we shoot back up so quickly as happened just recently.  Nothing has happened to bitcoin to change its value proposal, namely digital gold. The main game is the Halvening, and the year or two immediately after that. Calm your farm peeps.
