If something like this happened with Cash money, the banks would have to pay back each and every user right? Isn't this why banks are "good"? I feel like its news like this that scare me and many others away from unregulated crypto currencies.

Just watched it, it was nice. I still don't get how to send bitcoin via my private key. He used coinbase which has a built in feature to send bitcoin, but what if i dont have anything? 
Lets say I just magically found a bitcoin wallet, how can I use it to send bitcoin?

Has he had any activity at all since then? No one knows who he is correct?

Thank you very much for your input. In the USA I believe it is up to 250k people are covered at banks. Which is quite honestly more than probably what 90% of people in the US have in their said bank. I wonder if Crypto currencies will have any type of hacking insurance that can cover people as well. Cause right now it seems like it is very vulnerable to hacks.  As in once you get hacked and bitcoin leaves the wallet, its gone...

Do you think this is it? The final ride? This is as valuable bitcoin will ever get? Do you see a future where bitcoin is more commonly used than it is now? Do you see a future where bitcoin is owned by more people than there are now?

So for example I bought some coins on coinbase and it is on my coinbase account. How can I have it on my secure wallet? Please forgive me, I am still very new

I got my first big boy job out of college in 2014. As I got introduced to 401k and "investing" stuff, I told my friend "wow look at bitcoin going up to $250 , I think  I am going to just buy 1 bitcoin a month LOL" we both laughed and how stupid it sounded. :(  I bought in now at $11.5k lol

So if I buy say $100 of bitcoin on coinbase. Is that my wallet? How do I put that $100 of bitcoin onto a wallet? can I easily buy/sell from my wallet? Sorry for such noob question, I should do more research...

Can someone explain in detail the pros and cons of such a thing as BLX?

Was not a dumb move at all. If you are satisfied with it, if you made money with it, then it is a good move :)
