You don't have to report if you do less than 600 dollars in bartering, and there's no way to proove that you did or didn't, as you could have been sending bitcoins to yourself for plenty of reasons, or you could have lost it, or it could have been stolen, or it could be on a pool or shared address of some sort. The blockchain doesn't prove anything, just like if you're at the school playground and you're trading magic cards for baseball cards.

These people just keep falling over and over for these schemes. There are plenty of ''unregulated'' places, like say Isle of Man, or, say, Switzerland, and they surely wouldn't fall for these accounting or scam fuck ups. It's the culture of the people entering bitcoin, not bitcoin itself, that's at fault. And this culture is people that have done no business whatsoever, seeing as they've been perfectly content to have huge fees rammed down their throats for years and have uttered nary a complaint.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:34:19
Yes, good point, in that they're long-standing rules.
But look at it this way-- those rules meant very few people could move money around, and they had to do it through institutions like these.
Bitcoin reacted to that, and it means anyone can move money about without going through them.
So it's hostile to bitcoin in a back to the future kind of way.

Yeah I'm having lots of fun working back to 2013 and all those shut downs because they were ''transmitting'' money just because they were buying and selling bitcoins, and how they had to setup as MSBs if they sold over a certain amount, or if they sold in public as a business. There are plenty examples of companies that weren't handling or transmitting fiat, they were just exchanging two currencies, and that was the premise why they kept getting shut down and told to become expensive MSBs.

'A value that substitutes for currency' is hardly a property is it, but conveniently becomes ''a value that substitutes currency'' when they want to charge MSB fees of millions of dollars and seize funds because you're not registered as an MSB.

The Winklevosses have really fallen into their own Waspiness here, thinking the government would ever be interested in buying their bitcoins as 'the only clean ones'. The minute they go about validating coins, the Winklesvosses won't have anything to sell as their product won't be antifragile, international, or hard to pin down, it'll just be another paypal only way more complex and kinda without a point as paypal already does all this validating in the form of huge fees and privacy issues we all real mortals deal with painfully. And then there's credit card fraud, where the banks have had such a spectacular monopoly that they haven't bothered innovating to reduce fraud and its been hitting 10 billion a year in credit card fraud, there too we have another example of a validating system impoverishing us all.

comply with KYC and AML, they actually have to register as telecommunications thingies or something or other, not as financial entities. That's what the govt said, its an entirely different thing if they meant something else. Many countries of high regulations are usually ambiguous so as to give themselves more of an air, so in one of the google translations I read chinese ppl were asking themselves if registered telecommunications companies dealing with bitcoin transactions face to face instead of through wires and alipays wouldnt mean less control, so the general idea still is one of cluelessness

Don't get too cocky with all those upvotes, buddy, that's just the influx of dunces over at the buttcoin sub.
Paypal is the gold standard that regulation has brought. Governments have had 15 years to come up with something better, cheaper, and they did not, they just piled onto the fees to get their cut.
Paypal is the most widely used payment processor online.
That horrifying link from paypal shows hilarious fees all over the place.
And what started this conversation was equally pathetic-- the notion that paying wikileaks would be enough to go to jail. Fact is, everyone wants to be online these days, they don't want to be in their uk village in uk with its uk bank. Just the other day, FACT closed down a sports torrent that everyone was using because nobody was falling for the fees Sky and BBC were extracting from the peasants. Its not just trumped up charges from a swedish judge that ''just wants to do some questioning to Assange on behalf of two ladies that aren't saying it was rape''....

No it isn't. It's minority report. By your logic people should have digital chips implanted in them and google glass forced upon them, just in case they don't report their transactions in their day to day lives.
People obviously don't want that at all, neither offline nor online, and see no reason why online transactions should be stigmatized when offline transactions aren't.
And the rule of law doesn't occur in reversible transactions-- the fraud just gets shifted onto the merchant instead of onto the consumer, but the consumer ends up paying it anyways, imperceptibly but he does.
And the final killing irony is that the consumer should know better. Bitcoin can be as secure as they try hard to make an air gapped wallet, and its a security that, unlike government handling of credit card fraud, paypal hacks or Obamacare website security, will likely improve and be made easier to access because it has an incentive to do so.
That's 10 billion just in credit card fraud, 5% of the total. Why should we all have to pay because some people are too lazy and get hacked? Why should we have to pay because AML and KYC documents get stolen and that allows for so much identity theft?

They got away with a shit ton of money, but it was a total humiliation for the FEDS. Why? well because MtGox's bank account wasn't seized, Japan didn't shut it down, nor did it shut down MtGox's Polish accounts. Something went fishy in the ''proof'' that didn't convince foreign governments.

Wow, what a demented take on jobs. Jobs by definition are things you have to be paid to do, so odds are you don't want to do it and that a world where there are only jobs is a rather horrifying one.
90s is a very simple reference to your dreamland of cable networks where everyone has to pay for them, which was broken by those commie-like Napster and Bittorrent technologies.
I know you're getting horny about turning the internet where everyone just shares into a place where people do jobs for other people.

Yes oops silly me. It'll be better for all of us when Comcast strikes deals with Netflix and Youtube to be the only ones we're allowed to have lots of bandwidth with.
Nope, not silly me at all. It's not hard to understand that behind the ''free market'', omg free??? how can I be against freedum!?!?... anyway behind the ''free market'' stands alienating property rights where we let the profiteers in and screw up relationships between people.
So yup, of course this means that if net neutrality is destroyed, if the internet isn't considered a utility, if it's considered information instead, in two minutes the internet becomes like the cable networks, that get more and more expensive because there is no alternative. No alternative to property rights, which is what the ''free market'' is really about.

The Fed was the sleazy one. It was US govt (and paypal profiteers) that made paypal so expensive and with every vendor risking chargebacks, so millions of people used Liberty Reserve instead. Preet Bharara then invented the concept that all the funds inside Liberty Reserve were illegal and screwed all its users over. The irony is Bitcoin allows the same cash-like transactions Liberty Reserve was allowing, but its decentralized and they can't target anyone specific.
Exchanges or banks not on U.S. soil don't have to register as MSB-- well I suppose they do according to the U.S. but the U.S. sure seems to be having trouble convincing other countries of this. I don't know what the hell has been going on in MtGox this last year as they always say the reason their wires have issues is due to court investigations, but if they were really that bad then their european SEPA and their japanese domestic transfers wouldn't have worked a lot better.

As for maxing out at 3.3%, and who the hell uses Paypal for national payments not that that would matter as it's supposed to be international, what kind of a lie is the 1%? Why would I care if some people happen to have money inside their paypal accounts, most people have it on their debit card and that maxes out at 7.4% as you yourself see on their website, and that's not even including the 5% they probably chop off for the exchange rates the banks or paypal choose to apply which are always ridiculous. And that's not adding the expenses of moving the money out of the damn paypal account that the merchant incurs...
And as for international wires, yes if you've ever had one returned for an error of somesort, you'll see 10% lopped off, 5 each time...

The December crash in Bitcoin price was caused by Chinese regulators. The current crash in BTC price was caused months ago when the US unoficially blocked MTGox wires in dollars (they can't seem to do anything about wires in other currencies despite being so ''reasonable''). Funnily enough, in both China and the U.S., its government employees crawled out of the woodwork attempting to blame lack of regulation for the issues.
Lowering the bar for cash transactions mean Visa and Mastercard get a huge cut. Increasing the regulation requirements mean only huge businesses can swoop in, while average people have to lose time and money. And for the life of me I can't think why a bank would want you to store your money in a bit or under your mattress.

Well given that bitcoin is a currency, AML and KYC gives the power to a bunch who think it's property just because they can't pin it down for counterfeiting like they did with Liberty Reserve or the Liberty Dollar. It exposes you to hacks, surveillance and chargeback fraud, and finally augments the price of service by several orders of magnitude, which is why Liberty Reserve used to charge 1% and Paypal charges 4%. Then in countries or states with VAT, all you have to do is trade 2 or 3 times and by charging VAT each time you're down 60%...

The frenzied commenters forget that the trouble MtGox is in is actually the fault of the shitty US govt.
It's been nearly one year and still MtGox can't send wire transfers in U.S. dollars but it can in other currencies. This is because of the arrogance of the U.S. govt that thinks every transaction in dollars is its property even if it's not between americans.
The seizure of MtGox was also probably bullshit, seeing as they were in the process of becoming an MSB, had a momentary disagreement with Coinlab on which of the two had to register as MSB and the FBI swooped in for the prize, when just a couple months later the FBI had had to ask FinCen if they had the right to do this, it seemed as if both the FBI and MtGox had been trying to understand MSB law.

It's a communicative media where peers contact peers, it's not an information media where content providers get to strike deals to worsen the access their rivals get.

ISPs have already been buying TV companies or have been bought by TV companies so they're in the content industry so there's a conflict of interest-- a monopoly.

You can't have it both ways-- if it goes up, hoarding is the issue because it went up, if it goes down people don't spend even though the price is falling shouldn't it be the other way around according to the first point? Instead they have a new psychological crush on how the price used to be.

This contradicts the ''how lame they have to move just because of two protesters'' statements.
If they do turn out to be honest, it'll prove the real fault lies in the market moving panicker commenter sockpuppets and in the US govt's seizure that took advantage of a temporary disagreement with Coinlab on who was going to do the registering as the MSB, a seizure that blamed MtGox for something NSA didn't do either, which was to actually be sure that they had to register as MSB which is why the NSA had to ask FinCen for clarification.

That's not security, that's just that the losses are spread to us all.
Reversibility in transactions was never about protecting the common man, it was about tax evasion and controlling how people interacted with each other online.
Most people will veer towards decentralization and irreversible transactions if government isn't able to technologically oppress them. Look at torrents and how the govt is just getting round to sending millions of people automated fines, or look at how govt is hounding down online poker.
There's a wide divide between what seems normal-- ''govt is cracking down on drugs, arms and child pornography'' when in truth it's 99% plain old boring tax evasion.
When funds become reversible, government can come in and control its citizens. I think there were many payment processors ten or fifteen years ago that started out irreversible until the U.S. govt started going after them because they could be targeted, and then they either went under or started charging enormous fees.
The internet is where everyone wants to be. Middle America is a huge fan of online porn, there's a big psychoanalytic zing to how the internet reveals our true desires. Most people would much rather prefer hard money, but they're fucked sideways into shutting up.
Protection would really be about paypal handling your bitcoins, nothing more. Coinvalidation is a much more sinister agenda geared to making everyone paranoid as to where their coins have been. And historically millions of normal acceptable people were using payment processors like Liberty Reserve or eGold. Coinvalidation is really just about giving more power to american lawyers than they already have, it would create an absolute nightmare of chargebacks and big brotheryness.

Romanticism in the 19th century was pretty good at pinning down the need for a better life. It had a go at how nature had subjected everything down to will, and how art was one of the few ways out of this linked up vicious cycle. A good example was the first world war, where everyone was, indeed, ''working'', working at what you might ask... Something similar happened when multiplexes took over angry countercultural movies, in the 1980s and 90s, which were a terrible period for aesthetics and storytelling. Sharing a movie is like having a friend, are you against friendship? Are you against the hive shared mind, and in favor of the alienated competing bodies in the factory line? Another good example was porn, it was ghettoed in the 80s, a good part of the reason for that was copyright, but now everyone fucks for a sport. Science however is furious, judging from links like this one:

MtGox was regulated, and might even have wasted all those bitcoins on getting regulated, perhaps a stretch to think that perhaps not. The market was cornered into having to use MtGox for buying bitcoins, making too many coins be there. And also, more often than not, that's like blaming the science project when the monkey spills it on the floor, we're talking about people that put up with fees and fraud for years from debit cards and so on. Lastly the fees I link to from paypal are enormous, 4% to 7.5% for debit card, 1% for movements inside paypal, 2.5% + 3-4% for currency conversion, and that's just one direction, the merchant could probably have more fees taking it out.

This Lee guy then goes on to say 'bartering' isn't mentioned, when the interviewer asks if it affected bartering 'because the U.S. has a provision on bartering'. Maybe the keyword is 'priced' and you can only price things in currency terms not in commodity terms, and commodities can only be traded/exchanged? So when Wang says it's ring-fenced, it would seem it can't reach the heights of RMB but can become a niche, like Hong Kong.

Just because all the sites and movies seem to be ripped and then they have to deal with horny people that do it for nothing, and really amateur productions that also get ripped and to top it off, the porn industry can't even win court cases in Germany, a crazily pro copyright country. I assume anyone horny these days doesn't have to think of slapping out a credit card because xhamster, redtube and whatnot looms like a pretty groovy orwellian big brother

Didn't BTC China close saying it now had to ID all customers and that once that was done they could return to bank wires?
If so, that would just put China at the same level the rest of the world is right now, and this is all just FUD.
Except Okpay, which i think recently returned to this, I don't know of payment processors that can fund bitcoin exchanges, it's only wires worldwide.

so who's right, this guy or the Joseph Wang guy who says precisely because it's a commodity and not a currency, it's not subject to currency control, and it can be used as barter like any other commodity and barter isn't forbidden.

There was a big ripple effect as a result of a forbes article on a start up known as Coin Validation, where government tries to creep into btc and destroy its fungibility, which it wouldn't do with its own dollar bills.

Doesn't the UK have laws about double imposition of VAT, so if you buy a gift card and charged VAT when you buy it, you're not charged VAT when you buy an actual product with the gift card? Doesn't that apply to bitcoins? And what about when they sell the bitcoins they bought at Zip Zap, don't they get to discount the VAT they lost because it turned out to be an investment with or without ROI but not a product?

The fact some people didn't get it when its about the US dollar, while bitcoin users have to be on the defensive and go to congress to defend their fungibility, is fucking sad.
