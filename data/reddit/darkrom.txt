The civic type r laps a shitload of exotic cars at the ring, but still boring on the street.   Perfect example.

What did most people do to earn their money?  This ignores so many basic things to just assume everyone can take from some collective pot that just infinitely stays full.

Yeah it’s only smart to let google monetize everything you do.    Or do you use a rotary phone?
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:39:07
Right.  Even rooted there’s the closed baseband etc.  there’s also root detection and locked encrypted bootloaders.  Proprietary closed sourced blobs etc.

Where did I imply anything about Apple at all? My stance is that both cannot be trusted for differing reasons.  
Apple did take the stance of telling the FBI to fuck off.  So makes you wonder if there are backdoors, who gets access?
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:23:38
Which ones
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:35:50
Doesn’t that run modified android not Linux?

Apple might have backdoors.  Your suggesting to use another almost definitely backdoored system.  My point is neither can be fully trusted. I’m not taking sides, I’m remaining logical.  Your answer is Apple users have no brains.  Seems like a little bias going on.

Thanks I’ll look it up tonight.   Any suggestions on things people can do? Can’t control the weather sadly.

Thanks anyway I’ll order anyway.

Fair enough.  The actual book seems sold out everywhere or out of print.  Maybe I can find a pdf

If you are serious look into barometric pressure.   I am a heavy cannabis user and I notice I use less on days that I feel headaches or migraines.  Smoke of any kind is bad for headaches.  I’ve been resorting to all kinds of things to try to get migraine relief even nasty pharmaceuticals.

Which state have legal cbd? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:12:24
Cbd profit margin is enormous in large scale operations.

Its gimmicky as hell but this is more likely to drive people to actually use it as a currency than say, lambos.   I’d buy a gimmicky bitcoin shirt just to do it and use it as an actual currency.

Which store? My hounds will be rich soon.
