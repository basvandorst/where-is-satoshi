When I pay my mortgage , every payment to principle is like putting money in a bank account.  If ever I sell the home, I get the difference - fees and maintenance between buying price, amount paid, and selling price.  
When i pay rent, I take that money , desiccate it, and snort it through a straw.  
How can you get this completely backwards? 
Renting and own aren't even far apart in cost.  You can even use your homes value to generate capital for other kinds of investment, you can't do that with a rental either.  Under no circumstance except for a apocalyptic home price crash or interest rate explosion should renting be the preferred investment over a home long term. 
This is easily the worst advice I've read on the internet, and it comes at no surprise it is here at r/bitcoin.  
I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.

The objective of trading is to take profits. "smart traders" take profits, they don't catch falling knives. 
Even investors are ultimately doing so out of self interest to gain something, be that control, hedging, ideological reasons, but mostly again, profits.  (on a longer expanse of time)
This "not fiat" but not pegged to anything, centrally manipulated by china, internet money, financed by debt (until recently and shock, falls in price) follows the same rules as everything else.  If you just buy all the time , never take profits, you're an investor, not a trader.  And in either case, not smart about it.

I understand your point fine.   If this person has a large position prior to September 2017, they are doing fine, and can increase their holdings because they have profits locked in.  (up to a point) 
I get it.  It isn't complicated.  
You don't seem to understand my point. 
The world largely operates on non-crypto fiat in exchange for labor.  if you take real world capital earned by labor, and put it into trades that are losing money, you lose money no matter how you change your perspective about it.   This thread is about rejecting reality, it is right there in the title.  
Ignoring reality is a luxury that only someone in a profitable position gets to have.  And even then, they change perspective real quick once they are no longer in that position.  Suddenly they care about comparing their holdings to the real world where they still need to acquire resources to survive. 
But kudos to your crypto-arbitrage.  I have nothing negative to say about that.  Looks like a solid strategy.

Have the last 10 days aged well for you?  Friendo?

So you rejected reality and embraced a delusion.
A shame in reality you are paid in fiat so you really are losing the product of your labor.
How does that feel, feels so great you've embraced delusions right?
Yep, awesome.

5 reasons why i think bitcoin will hit 5000 in the next 20 days.
 panic

 ignorant speculators
 altcoin crash

You also lock in your ability to exit a catastrophic fucking disaster and  use the liquidity to reenter after it bottoms in an effort to regain your losses, or at least retain some of the investment.

Bag holders trying to convince others to jump in so they can take profits and run.  
Same old story.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:04:48
Also, those of you saying those people selling for loss are suckers, or idiots. Probably bag holders, but I digress.  You don't take a long position on speculative trading.  Especially something so volatile, you take profits when you can, you also leave positions while you can.  What is the end game of bitcoin?  The end game is it get big enough that governments start protecting their own currency by doing shit just like China.  Bitcoin has no future.  Small fish in the biggest pond ever.  
This place reads just like a pennystock forum.  Everyone is an idiot for selling after a haircut, all those idiots usually mitigate their losses and live another day, while everyone else watching prices plummet to nothing has just became a poorly paid hype man for dogshit.

Which on its own will be its failure.  Volatility chases investors away.  Sure, you'll get run ups, and money will be made.  But too many burned investors and the juice runs out.
