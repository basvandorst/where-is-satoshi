Are you serious? Is that what the $50 means on the gold coins? So, what does that exactly mean in terms of reporting?
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:14:21
Yep, basically :-|

I should get a lawyer I suppose. However, no lambos for me. Been frugal my whole life. Someone would have to put a gun to my head to get me to buy one of those!
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:43:40
Yep, want to pay the taxes .Well, not really, but I am not interested in complicating things more ;)
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:38:24
In the USA. Will have to pay capital gains. Long-term, to be exact.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:19:13
Bitcoins may have been worth 500 or so when I mined them (maybe less?) so I'd just assume for simplicity BTC was worth $0 at the time I obtained them. I'd have to pay taxes only when I convert to USD or make a purchase. So if I buy a house, I need to pay capital gains on that. if I buy a laptop, I have to pay capital gains. Etc.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:52:56


Any advice on how to find a good one? I Never hired a lawyer before.


I wonder if an offshore bank account would help with this. Of course I'd report that I have such account but have it somewhere that would both accept my money and not comply with US laws that demand the funds be seized in the event of an attempted CF.
Just a thought.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:03:43
Like LBC, I'd charge an markup. But until then I am doing nothing until I can solve this.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:34:11
Could be true. Most stories I remember were cops that took money during traffic stops. However, I did hear of some other cases where the bank account was raided because the owner put deposits in like 9K a week for a few months and they thought it was "structuring." No charges, just took the money.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:14:39
That could work, only if my coins were connected anymore. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:43:09
While I am a pro-privacy (which should be obvious at this point, how can I sell hundreds or couple million for cash and not face more problems?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:32:48
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:46:00
This isn't laundering. The money isn't "dirty", which laundering would "clean." It's legit earned. I just don't have the proof any more. It's been years and years destroyed. It wasn't worth a whole bunch when I mined them that I didn't care. I didn't even know how to sell them then. Then after a couple years it was worth more and I took it a little more seriously and experimented with Bitcoin some more. Now we're in 2017 and it's out of control. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:46:55
So you have been seeing them for a while? If so, how well is that working out so far? 
yea, just on Reddit looking for general guidance. And also, looking for others that were/are in the same situation. I've seen posts online before with similar situations but they never write back months/years later about how it was resolved.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:45:24
She knows I like Bitcoins and that I have some but she doesn't know how much I have. Well, she doesn't know how much we have. 
I never told her because first of all I had them before we met. I also never wanted it to become a "thing" in the family. If I tell her she'll tell her family and news will spread pretty quickly to old acquaintances and distant in-laws. I also never wanted to put burden on her asking her to keep it a secret. She would if I asked, but she is so close to her family she'd eventually feel pressure to tell them. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:20:59
In the US. Haven't done anything wrong so I am not worried about anyone finding anything on me. But, I just don't the attention. I like to minimize stress in my life.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:27:57
As for goals, I just want to "retire" and live off investing returns. Retiring doesn't mean never work again, travel for life, and party. I am young. But, I just want to do whatever I want on my own terms. Work if I want, quit if I want, travel if I want, or take a nap when I want.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:58:53
You're right. I can do some research though. I'll likely hire a lawyer and such, but I guess the difficult part would be convincing the banks that my money is legit rather than worrying about the gov't stealing my money?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:53:12
I wish I did, but I don't. I think I mentioned somewhere that they are no where to be found.Mined the coins, moved them around on the blockchain, deleted wallets (clean up computer "junk", you know?), and never again. In fact, the HD it was on was damaged when I broke my laptop. That's in a landfil now.
Back then if I felt they'd be worth something I would have kept the wallet. But, at the time bitcoin was just one of a million things I toyed with. 999,999 of them amounted to nothing.. bitcoin did. Shame.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:38:29
Good advice, thanks. Though, I believe I mentioned that I have no proof. The coins are long away from their original source and most, if not all, have been swapped with new coins. Some of the places I moved the coins to (and back from) were years ago and gave someone else's coins. I didn't use "tunblers" but that's just what happened. The BTC casinos, especially. I might put in 10 BTC and withdraw 10 to get someone else's coins.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:26:13
50% to keep some money in Bitcoins. II believe in the idea of Bitcoin but I do not feel confident keeping more than half of my money in it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:24:26
Yes. It's retarded stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:49:01
Yea, I have seen a lot of replies saying to HODL, "f*** banks", and more. I get the passion but I don't think most of them would do the same in my situation. 
I Believe in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, but I am young. This amount of money is enough to take care of me for life. But, I do not want to turn 60 one day and for whatever reason Bitcoin comes to an end or I make a mistake and lose my life savings to a hacker.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:11:42
Sort of ridiculous that I'd have to "launder" money that wasn't illegally obtained. Not saying you're wrong but can't other evidence stand in it's place? Like my personal hobbies, what I studied in college, etc? Things that could substantiate my claims? Given all that (and more), one may be able to see it's possible I was involved in mining. I've not some silk road vendor from years ago or some ransomware author. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:28:57
Bitcoin is cash to those that accept it. 99.9% of the businesses I transact with do not accept Bitcoin and cannot even tell you what it is other than "that online drug and ransomware money". 
I support Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, I do not feel confident keeping a majority of my net worth in it. I feel fine keeping 50% of it in there, but I want the other 50% in fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:41:02
Sounds like tax evasion. Not sure, but I don't want to over complicate things and make it look like laundering.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:14:40
They already broadcasted one on your behalf... just not to you :-P
I don't trust the gov't :(
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:07:41
The blockchain would if the connections still existed. They don't. That's my problem. They have ALL been moved around between various BTC casinos, trading alts, and other systems that often exchange or otherwise obfuscate the origins. I've had fun with tumblers, JoinMarket, etc. I've done it all. Now, I realize it was a terrible idea to lose the trail.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:13:50
Because it's leaving all my money in one place.
If I have $2 million in bitcoins, most HODLers are telling me to hold. However, if each of those HODLers had $2 million in their bank account, I seriously doubt that a majority of them would place all $2 million in Bitcoins or any other alts. 
Both situations have the same outcome, but one of them makes you consider the risks of placing a large some of money into one idea. 
I support Bitcoin and some alts, but it's not wise to keep a majority of your net worth into one thing.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:32:05
Jokes on you, the NSA has air-gapped access to your offline wallet.
I'm jokng. Or, maybe I'm not.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:29:59
Monero is going to be a tough one if you don't have the original wallet :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:15:51
I could, but I am not looking for cashing out methods. Those are easy.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:17:33
50% in cryptos. Probably spread evenly at first in BTC, Eth, and maybe Dash/Golem/somthing.
50% of fiat spread into different index funds, gold, real estate, etc. May just buy land rather than real estate because there is a finite amount and it's always in demand. Can grow trees that I sell as lumber for some additional income.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:00:12
I guess keeping records of old wallets will need to be part of everyone's record keeping.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:31:15
Yep, this is what I want. No Lambos, no luxury vacations, etc. Just a solid 70-100K a year to do what I want.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:50:04
As far as I know, it's not illegal to use a casino, online or not. The thing that is illegal is operating one.
I could be wrong, IDK. But, I have to be honest about the funds.
Yep, I guess I am a millionaire. Quite young, too. Though, I sure as hell don't feel like one :-|
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:01:54


Or a fire that burns my cash. 
I would like to assume that if I just pay my taxes, I'd hope the gov't doesn't harass me. I just worry about so-called civil forfeiture laws.


True for now, but who knows about tomorrow. It's why I said I still want to hodl 50% or so. But, I am also no longer wanting to keep all my eggs in one basket. Far too risky. 
Some crypto (not all BTC), some gold, some stocks/index funds, some foreign assets, etc. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:42:23
Because it's value could drop tomorrow? What if a Core Dev gets hacked? What if one of them is corrupted and the integrity of BTC dies because of it? 
Slim chances, but I hold more money than I might save on my own in my life. I don't trust placing everything into one system.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:56:27
Thank you for the advice. Yea, I could be overthinking it. However, I do not have a social circle that includes people that make 6 figure transactions. Everyone around me is "average" or at least "above average" in terms of salary, assets, banking, etc. So I do not really have anyone I can look to that would help change my thoughts that 6 figure transactions are normal.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:04:47
Some have suggested that a lawyer can hire the right tax advisor to also help save me a lot of money on taxes. But also they say it would be nice to have on on hand to deal with the bank if they question the money. I am getting the sense that for the most part the government won't care that much about my money as long as I pay taxes and I am not known to have or to currently be committing any crimes. But, the bank(s) could be a problem since all my bank is going to see in an electronic transfer of a large windfall. Suddenly my bank account goes from $2,000 to $1,000,000... for example. That deserves some questions.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:02:36
I appreciate the post. It's a long one but I read every word of it.
As for why I want to take out 50%? Because 50/50 is how I feel about BTC right now. I want some in it but I don't want ALL of it in it.
You know what my ultimate goal is out of all this? I don't want to withdraw and buy jets, cars, travel the world to stay in luxury hotels, etc. I want the money somewhere that will guarantee me a living salary from interest for life. Never run out of money and then give it all away when I die. if I could generate $100,000 a year for life in interest, dividends, and growth I'd be happy. 
I could just do that with bitcoin I guess, but my fear is bitcoin could one day crash. Dev gets hacked, gov't bans it, etc. Unlikely but all my eggs are in one basket and I do not know how long I can tolerate it. Bitcoin and other cryptos keep rising in value/price, but it's a bit unnerving to keep seeing that what I bought yesterday could have been bought for cheaper today... and if i wait a week it'd be half the cost. Seems nice in theory, but things could easily correct.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:09:37
That is amazing. I never knew that! Definitely gives me something to think about. Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:39:53
All of them. In the physical world I am the only person that knows I have these. I'm a private person as you might imagine. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:35:48


That part, I know. But, I've read too many stories about "civil forfeiture" where money is taken without pressing charges on the individual that possessed it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:48:03
Sounds like a good idea but how could i buy a house? Or a car? Or fund some savings to buy things that only fiat can now/?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:24:44
Hackers find a way when they associate a name with a large bitcoin wallet. Not saying I am not doing security properly and plenty of people let others know they have a lot of Bitcoins, but I'd rather not risk it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:40:40
I am speaking strictly about civil forfeiture laws. I've done nothing wrong so I personally wouldn't be charged. But civil forfeiture laws would, in theory, allow the gov't to take it from me if they have "suspicion" that it's the proceeds of crime. 
Unlikely I guess but I have heard of this happening to all sorts of random people.
