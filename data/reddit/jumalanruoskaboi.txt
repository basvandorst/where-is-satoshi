Not quite the same, but I'm planning to use my btc funded debit card for all my payments as soon as it arrives. 
What ever I fund it with, I'll buy back immediately. 
I can't really use btc for my daily purchases directly, as I haven't seen anyone around here accepting btc for groceries and beer. And those are the two things I mostly spend on. 
But yeah, I like the idea and do my best to live accordingly. Anything that's left of my pay check after rent and bills, I'm gonna send to an exchange so I'm ready to buy more btc as I spend it with a card. .

It started off as a currency, and after proving itself and gaining adoption is now a speculative store of value which creates even more intrest. 
People flock to btc now because they see it's value increase. This mass adoption eventually levels off, and makes the price stabilise. By this time, scaling solutions are ready. This in turn is the time it will be used as a currency again. 
In the meantime, I hodl and spend at the same time. Spending with a debit card, buying everything I spend back with fiat.

I sodl'd some last night figuring more hashrate = more coins available. And seeing the volume drop I figured the pump is over and the price is gonna tank. 
As I'm not at all sure how this is going to play out I'm probably going to buy back at some point, I'll just wait for a bigger dip in bch. 
I think btc took the bch pump pretty well, I believe the aim was to tank the btc price while pumping bch. Didn't quite go as planned ;)

The backlog is there only when btc hashrate drops. 
Btc hashrate drops only when shitcoin activates the (now-forked-away) EDA. 
The EDA was there only to violently and dramatically pull hashrate away from btc from time to time
See the vicious circle? 
The shitcoin was created for this. This, and making its creators filthy rich by luring in the simple people with unfounded promises and solutions to problems they themselves make, pumping money (btc) from said simpletons by selling them their long-accumulated, cheaply bought and mined bch , and cashing out (to btc)  on the top, of which they decide where it is. 
Then some fake news, and rinse and repeat.

Depending on the survival of the new chain, and your ability to split your coins, ofc. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:47:16
Sure, for some time. 
Hash rate fluctuating between three coins, of which Bch will adjust diff after every block so it'll be fine. Good ole btc and the newcomer will have the same difficulty, and probably the bastard baby will die quickly. But it will take some hash power away from honey badger , which is slowing it down even more. 
This is when the next bcash pump will take place, when btc is even weaker than now. Remember, that before this, Jihan Ver is dumping bcash for massive btc profits, to be strong for round three. And this is the final battle, the last level boss fight. 
But as plans a and b have failed, so will plan c.

Spam is not a problem anymore? I'm not sure I agree with that...
But, I agree that in order for btc to run smoothly, something needs to happen, and sooner rather than later. Maybe a 2mb block size increase, maybe something else. I don't know, I can't really think about the possible outcomes of different solutions, I'm no expert. 
But others are, and so far they've done excellent work, Bitcoin has grown and become more and more accepted within the general public. Not only as "the money to buy drugs  with", but as something that might give something of value to all sorts of people in this world, be it freedom, remittance, "gold", Lambo, or the drugs. 
In my opinion, Bitcoin has been in good hands so far.
I'm happy to see those same hands take care of it in the future as well.

They have a wallet that you deposit btc (and other crypto later) into, that wallet is tied to your card. You then use your card, no fees other than the exchange rate which ofc is a bit worse than the best rate you could get.

Maybe today, if ever. 
Today's gonna be the last push for bch*, after five hours the diffuculty is going to shoot up again. Tomorrow they're gonna fork with a more stable DAA. 
If they don't accomplish bch being more profitable to mine before the fork, I don't think it's ever going to be. 
So, today they are pushing. 
(I'm ready to buy even if it doesn't reach that low. I'm confident. )
* Jihan Ver does have an ace in his sleeve, though. The S2X fork is happening as planned, the software is out there, there are miners and nodes running it. ATM they say they're not supporting it, but who knows what's gonna happen if everything else fails.

Someone at rbtc was wondering why so many posts he had replied to were deleted.

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:44:50
I was wondering this too. 
More people selling than buying, I get it, but selling all of them at once? To what, usdt? I think almost only one to gain at the time was bcash. 
Btw, I've only checked btc/usdt and ALT/btc pairs. So if BTC drops against usd, I would imagine nothing would happen to ALT values against BTC, right? 
Or, when btc drops could there be arbitrage opportunities for alts that are paired with fiat as well as btc? And the army of bots, always vigilant, would quickly take advantage of it, making every alt lose value against btc as well?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:43:49
Does it happen at a certain block height or certain time?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:52:12
The thing is, I think the new DAA is gameable; if someone has control over a lot of hashpower, they can switch it to btc just before the adjustment to prevent it from scaling down - and even make it  scale up, - and return to wherever right after that. 
Same thing can't be done to the other chain, as the diff adjusts after every block. 
You'd need control of a decent amount of hashpower, and some coins in your pocket, but I think some people playing the game have them both...
Might be something I'm missing here, I'm no expert, but I see that as a possibility. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:18:03

It's gonna happen. 
The software is there, someone's gonna be running it, the forkening is happening. 
The amount of backing it's gonna get is a mystery of course. But, remember the "mystery miners" mining bcashit? There are mysterious things going on in the mystical world of mysterious China. 
And ofc no split coins for ppl not having their monies in appropriate wallets / exchanges. 
...imagine the chaos when the forkening happens all of a sudden, and the "mystery" miner appears with 30% of current hashrate?
That's Plan C from Far East, I tell you.

BCH is an attack on Bitcoin, it is competing directly with Bitcoin for the same hashpower. The BCH people are trying to make their coin more profitable for the miners to mine, hoping they will ditch Bitcoin in favour of bch. 
That's why bch is different from the other alts. 
They want Bitcoin dead.

Pretty much all in in crypto, btc being 85% of it. My portfolio turned one year old two days ago (Btc's birthday too lol), so I have seen some decent gains.

I think there was a massive backlog issue in may/June, and as I recall it, it was the time when Bitcoin Unlimited (with the backing of such influential names as Ver, Wu...) threatened to fork off the main chain. 
And then the NYA was signed (not by core, mind you). 
And then the mempool cleared. 
What a coincidence!
Also, there were mempool issues even earlier in the spring, definitely in march, maybe even earlier, and somehow I remember BU was very vocal at trying to push for a block increase, always when that happened...
Coincidence? Maybe, maybe...

Your friend buys Bitcoin and transfers it to your wallet. Now you have Bitcoin. 
You pay your friend what you owe him. Now you still have a friend. 
You don't tell the authorities anything about your Bitcoin. Now you have your freedom. 
Simple as that. 
I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin in Australia so can't help you with that.

I bought some about a year ago  or so. Them I bought again with the same amount during the New Year peak  Then on the 5th of January it crashed 20% when China banned Bitcoin. 
They were hard times, hard times indeed. 
Since then every crash has been easier to deal with, during this last one I didn't really feel any stress at all. 
Now I'm up more than 800%, as I did some well timed alt buying in jan/feb. Feeling pretty good. 
Happy hodling!
(Ps. First I used breadwallet and electrum, now I'm a happy owner of a Ledger Nano S)

Put half of that in btc. Or a third. Or a fifth, whatever. Depends on your risk tolerance. 
I'm not talking you out of this.
