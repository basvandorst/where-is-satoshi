It seem that you have no tax from turning your money to an other.  
For money likes EUR to USD to Sterlings, it's maybe not a big deal. But I see that as a first step to something bigger.  
It's gonna be huge when that system reach Africa and Asia. Huge for 2 reasons: easy to use for mainstream ppls, and -seem- free of charges.

If the private key is lost, the BTC are mostly lost forever,or until someone find back that key.  
  
If you place all 21M BTC on 1 address, and lost the private key, they're gone.  
Technicaly the amount of BTC isn't decreasing but increasing. But the number of BTC lost and remain unaccessible is increasing.

Same issue here
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:20:03
Well, it's working well for me, no issue, customer for 6 months. You only need to be verified.
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:28:07
I wonder how the servers are oriented.
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:30:38
That's the goal. Open source software are open to any coders, hackers, white or black hats. This is how you make the most secure app over the time. Bitcoin closed source is no sense. Like Windows, or cyclism.
Alone you go faster, together you go deeper.
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:19:40
That's a very US oriented propaganda.
Peoples can build weapons, but not all can mine bitcoin.
Weapons are not freedom. Freedom is when we don't have to use them. Bitcoin isn't a weapon, it's a improvement for our society, without fight, but with maths.
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:26:42
For some peoples loss, some others won.
@_date: 2017-02-15 12:32:38
The network need miners and high hashing power to increase the price of an attack &amp; secure the network.  
By 'losing power' I don't mean that we switch the algo or just remove mining. I just have not a clue of which solution will be taken, but peoples (= users, nodes, devs, services, ...) won't accept forever to be blocked by a few miners on critical updates.

A lot of peoples here seem to just think that Brave will introduce a basic wallet system on the browser. So why not just use an extension on an other browser, or a 'classic' wallet ?  
With Brave you'll get an option to replace Ads, and you'll get paid for the Ads you watch. The wallet is not here just to support the payments you'll do, but also to pay you with shares you can spend on other sites you likes.  
    


  
@_date: 2016-03-09 14:13:31
Yes, it's say like 15% of the gross ad revenue. With not much details.    
But that mean something important, if I understand well, you'll able to spend that revenue only to support your preferred sites.  
So we'll pay websites with the money we earn from the Ads. In other terms, instead of tracking you to get money, this system pushing websites to work on the quality. An happy visitor = Bitcoins.

What happen if Roger sell his core coins, then the BU chain merge back to the core chain ? He'll just lost everything ?

The good side of this story is that user, nodes keepers, some miners, services &amp; devs will work to prevent this kind of attack. Each vulnerability is exploited a day or an other, it's better for us it's happening now.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:52:24
Nope, they generate blocks. Then nodes accepts (or not) the new blocks.  
The Blockchain is generated with both miners &amp; nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:04:07
Yeah but difficulty should retarget every 2016 blocks (2 weeks). If the hashrate drops, the delay between blocks will be higher.

The math (or the title) is misleading.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:37:01
Not sure I should be agree with N°3.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:03:24
But if miners switch to BU, Core will not receive that hashrate ? That's why I'm talking about lose

Market manipulation will always be.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:06:56
If BU activates, the network should split. I'm calling BU an altcoin but it's arbitrary.
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:24:21
It's exactly the point I'm defending, why a few peoples decide for the whole network ?  
Miners will switch for improvements only if it's profitable. I'm worried to see Bitcoin led by some money makers. If nodes are rejecting non SegWit blocks, signaling SegWit become profitable.

Sasha Ivanov (Waves CEO) also dumping around 24k, within several batch.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:20:36
Nice manipulation... this leaves to him enough to dump slowly above that price on believers, then buying back low.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:28:09
Thanks, Satoshi !
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:27:02


  
This should be pinned
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:51:19
Yes. It seem that a non-segwit block will be re-organized. But I wish a dev could ELI5 us on that.
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:47:58
I'm not sure. I just understand that it's still possible for miners to use ASICBoost while SegWit is enabled as they can keep mining "normal" blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-20 07:06:10
This is the best solution so far
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:52:22
Instead of crushing on peoples, just help to educate and share your other sources.

I feel you're right,  
I would do it so far.  
My only issue today,  
If you lose your key,  
you're forever doomed.  
A 1 point failure was, is and will never be a solution.

We can't indefinitivly revisit how blocks are managed. It's not a scaling solution, the network, the nodes, peoples won't handle a perma growing size of the blocks each time we push on the limit. If you want BTC to survive forever and max the decentralization, a 2nd layer is the better solution (= SegWit + LN atm).
@_date: 2016-05-19 11:30:37
I can't understand why you kept using that exchange.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:16:18
It's not a discussion anymore, the issue has been closed.
@_date: 2016-05-19 09:04:50
ETH is trading for BTC, so basicly you also add that '1/6' volume to BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:51:42
And now, try to explain you friend that on the 5 mBTC he bought he have to spend 1 for the fees.

Sell before a reorg ? YES !
