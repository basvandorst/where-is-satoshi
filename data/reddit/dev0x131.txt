I'm not oblivious to any irony here, nor did I say I expect Bitcoin to last forever. You're putting an awful lot of words in my mouth. MySpace was easy to leave because there was nothing stopping a user from using both services, which many did. Other than lame customization sites, very little infrastructure revolved around MySpace, so it was of little consequence when they shut down.

A lot of people are curious, just because they aren't technically knowledgeable doesn't mean that they should sit ignorantly in the corner. Why is it so important for you to be a cunt, exactly? How about you just chill, or don't; check back tomorrow, or don't. You won't be missed.

They both dominated for decades, I'd call that winning long term. Long term doesn't mean forever. I doubt the leading lighting company or car company of today will be leading in 100 years.

You don't matter, so no one cares what you did or didn't agree to. You use whichever chain you want, that decision is the extent of your power.

The code we know as Bitcoin Core has no code from Satoshi, pretty sure it's all been improved, removed, or replaced at this point. There are still hurdles ahead, but Bitcoin's code isn't static and so there's no reason to believe the innovation stops with SegWit or LN.

Usenet was more of a chatroom/forum, not a homepage.

Comparing the revolution of industries would be more apt. Analogies are rarely ever 1:1.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:02:17
I'm guessing your balls haven't dropped yet. GeoCities and Friendster both preceded MySpace; GeoCities had MySpace beat by nearly a decade.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:37:01
There are already more feature rich blockchains. This MySpace analogy is a bad one because part of what gives the Bitcoin blockchain value is the fact it was first and has proven stable. No one gave a shit that MySpace or any other site was first. It was easy to leave MySpace, but there's much more of an ecosystem tied into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:21:15
Where are all these posts from Satoshi discussing Bitcoin prior to the white paper? It was hardly a collective effort and consisted of fewer known contributors than Ford had early on. As stated elsewhere though, analogies aren't 1:1, smartphones running Linux isn't a better comparison or without its own set of differences either. The car analogy doesn't fall apart, it just isn't comparable in every aspect.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:29:09
Yeah, whatever. You prefer to teach a man to fish by asking him why he even wants to catch a fish? Telling him if he really wanted to catch a fish, he'd know how...?

First to market with a mass produced vehicle.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:22:15
Neither invented the car. Ford was the first to create a car that could be mass produced. Satoshi didn't invent cryptocurrency either, he invented a crypto currency that could be used by the masses.

Okay, go for it. I would argue that the digital age is still too new to have a gestalt understanding of our present day situation, and that is exactly why looking at historical technological revolutions is advantageous. We can see how things played out over time. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:54:22
It can also be bad, because on the off-chance BCH sticks around, that means a handful of people will have swept up the cheap coins, making it easier for them to manipulate the BCH market. Would be preferable to see a long, sustained dump to strain liquidity over time. Does that make sense? If you dumb all at once, coins get super cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:25:19
Like Ford? General Electric? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:08:45
As adoption increases, getting people to leave will be increasingly difficult too. Changes to a protocol that secures billions, maybe one day trillions, should be hard to change. Smaller cap coins are nimbler because they have smaller, more aligned user bases. The coin that someone puts out next week may learn from Bitcoins mistakes thus far, but it won't be perfect either; I don't see how any coin will have an easier time with large changes when they reach similar market caps and usage levels across a diverse userbase.

Bitcoin is the chain with the most POW, not the most nodes. Back to the drawing board frog fucker...
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:27:18
No, what Ford did was put all the pieces together to create more that just a motorized carriage, he made cars accessible and affordable. His achievement wasn't the vehicle, it was the process of making one. Just like the concepts used in Bitcoin aren't necessarily Satoshi's, what he did was bring those pieces together to create something people can access and use. The assembly like is analogous to the blockchain, and being first is a huge advantage.

Trying to have a conversation with an idiot is mildly frustrating; trying to have a conversation with an idiot who thinks he's a genius is downright maddening. Do yourself a favor and ignore this clown.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:33:57
Do you realize nearly every single comment you make is in a sarcastic tone? You're genuinely ill. Seriously,  you are not a sane person, as that is just not normal behavior. Either you're an actual child, in which case hopefully you'll outgrow this, or you're an unstable adult in a state of arrested development. Either way, get help.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:48:54
You're fucking delusional and you give Theymos way too much credit. This ”conversation" is over; I'm not gonna waste any more of my time on an attention whore like you. Look how much nonsensical bullshit you post here; you're genuinely crazy. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:55:26
So we should give BTC-e a pass? You're a moron. HSBC has nothing to do with this. Is that really your best defense here...that a bank got away with something, so illegal exchanges should be given a pass too?
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:50:33
Not sure what point you clowns are trying to make. I read these comments and I agree BofA and HSBC shouldve faced harsher punishment, but it doesn't change the fact BTC-e is a criminal enterprise and deserves to be shutdown. The worlds not fair, boy, deal with it; Bitcoin is at least a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:59:45
Theymos is just as bad as Ver in many ways. Valid discussions have been shut down here because it didn't fit Theymo's vision. Its wrong either way no matter what side you're on. People deserve transparency and freedom to discuss all aspects of Bitcoin and what it should or shouldn't be. Theymos isn't in charge of that and neither is Ver.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:52:11
Yeah, that's why they shutdown Coinbase and Gemini too. Oh wait, that didn't happen because those companies are operating within the law.
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:05:14
You're awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:11:52
You earned that one, buddy. Act like a fucking moron, get treated like one.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:45:37
You were keeping BTC on an unregulated exchange with unknown ownership.
Sorry, but you brought any losses upon yourself. The only thing that surprises me is that it took this long for BTCe to fall.
And bringing the holocaust into this to make a point is absurd and only makes you look like a moron.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:28:45
You are babbling like a crazy person. is certainly focused on their own agenda, but based just on your three replies to my comment, I'd probably ban your dumbass from any subreddit I was in charge of too. And Theymos had nothing to do with me finding out about Bitcoin but I'm not even going to get into that, you're too fucking crazy to have a rational discussion.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:28:43
Nah, just no tolerance when it comes to idiots.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:53:00
There's nothing you're going to tell me about John Nash I dont already know. His treatment has nothing to do with you. You're not treated like a moron by people on or for believing in Bitcoin. You're treated like a moron because you act like one. Why don't you shut the fuck up until you have something worth saying? Look at the low quality of your comment and posting history...now imagine if the quarter-million redditors here all posted that much garbage...this subreddit would be unbearable. You are full of yourself and you just need attention. Only someone with no life and nothing of value to contribute would spend as much time here as you do. Take the drama elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:07:04
Are you fucking kidding me? Don't compare yourself to John Nash, you moron. You're a delusional nobody; if you died right this moment, Bitcoin and its future wouldn't be any better or worse off. You don't matter. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:36:01
Maybe you should read a book on having a conversation like a mature adult; seems like you don't know what that is.
The replies you received were valid. Others here were merely pointing out the nuanced reality of the situation, a reality you seem blind to. And your response is to act like a condesceding, sanctimonious, sarcastic jerk. Fuck you. 
It's children like yourself that are ruining actual discussions in public bitcoin communities, because you didn't come here for discussion, you came here for an echo chamber.
