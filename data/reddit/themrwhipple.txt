Absolutely amazing and again, exactly as we all imagined it. At one point I had about 30 BTC on that exchange, luckily all I left on there before the collapse was about 30c. He will deny this shit all the way to the slammer...and the grave.

OK. It seems you've been downvoted. Your question must have been perceived as vaguely negative...!

Most certainly an OTC order/ private sale. No-one who wants even a fraction of their market value would try to actually dump them on the market.
That said, the BTC markets are more diverse nowadays and you would have to dump on the 5 major exchanges simultaneously to depress the price and keep it there. It really wouldn't take much effort for the price to correct though.
Another way would be to buy luxury goods with a low depreciation and sell those. A lot of merchants accepting Bitcoin even offer a BTC discount allowing you to keep even more of that nominal value.
You thinking of liquidating?

The spread.

Yes it's interesting (or at least telling) how quickly the price usually bounces back in these cases. Proving that market sentiment is rarely actually so finely balanced that a single dump would keep it moving downward.

The two in question, yes without a doubt. The mods are not all in thrall to Theymos.

I'll wager 1 BTC Theymos was behind the spoofed Satoshi email...

Great idea comboy. Thanks again for Bitcoinity, I've come back to using it after a couple of years because it never crashes on Android and because the volume-weighted price is often much more useful to me.

Just want to wake this thread up to say thanks. Hadn't sent a Bitcoin transaction in far too long and foolishly didn't update Electrum before I did so. CPFP is incredibly useful.

The .js file is fine to peruse with Dropbox's built-in viewer, in fact it was quite interesting because I've never opened a wallet file before. Do the contents look semi-legit to anyone who knows what to look for?
Regardless it's just there to add legitimacy to the .exe
You can't help think scammers would be a LOT more successful if they randomised the text though...

Yes it worked perfectly. Sorry only just noticed this.
