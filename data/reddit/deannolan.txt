The players still need to provide ID. They can't deposit anonymously.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:35:56
I looked but they don't accept Bitcoin. I'll try emailing them
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:36:06
Think this fits Bitcoin better

How would having 100 million change your day to day life more than having 10 million? To some people there is zero difference

There's tonnes of individuals begging when they don't need the money. The Youtube creator provides great value with his videos and teaches others.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:27:11
Excellent :)

There's your problem "buy almost all luxury items you will ever want".
There are not any luxury items I want that I need 100 mill for.

No, not what I mean. Head over to r/programming and read up. The latest meltdown and spectre exploits allow just javascript in the browser to get access to cache that it should not be able to. There's PoC that you can view demoing it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:21:44
No Bitcoin option unfortunately
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:52:08
Actually the scary thing is you don't need more than that. You can use Javascript run in a users browser to check for passwords and private keys in a users cached memory. Use a hardware wallet.

I've been using Bitcoin as a currency for over 5 years. What is it you think we are waiting on?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:32:23
Does if you use Trezor.
Don't think it needs to be verified anyway. That was at start when I had 25 btc in it. Now there's been 19 btc donated as can be seen on blockchain and tx list I posted (any of those charities will evrify for you, check twitter too)
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:34:42
Bitcoin Core do not have a donation link as it's many people working independantly. I tried donating to the link on bitcoin.org but they sent back as they are not Bitcoin core and they are just a website you can get the wallets from. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:48:47
This was one I picked but had problems with deposit. It turns out that there is a limit on donations when using bitpay as a payment processor so I will need to send in 2 transactions. I'll send them a donation tomorrow. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:42:49
No, I picked one of the most upvoted from the previous days
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:53:05
Thank you for all the work you are doing. I've been reading your stories on here for a while now. Glad I can add some help.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:47:53
It doesn't matter how much it is up if all of a sudden it can drop to zero. That's peoples real fear when the price starts dropping. It doesn't help when you have extreme difficulty selling for FIAT either.
I've been here since 2012/13. I am a holder and believe in the fundamentals of Bitcoin. But I can't stand it when I see posts of people saying "great, cheap coins" or "buy the dip". I assume most who say this have very little in Bitcoin. Also, why are they not buying this dip? :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:44:06
Sent to them now. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:55:57
I'm donating my own money, with proof in the post. You should read before commenting. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:59:10
Hi, sorry for lack of update, I'll post a new thread after making donations tonight
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:17:02
I donated 1 Bitcoin the them yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:51:06
It was a bad thing to do yes and I won't be reading your suggestion because of it
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:48
The one linked on the homepage had no answers that I could see (when searching for the OP's name)
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:01:01
I saw that but the AMA didn't have any answers which was a bit of a red flag
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:41:09
Not been up to date with Lightning for the past few months from a tech standpoint. Is it actually ready to use in production? If so I'll add it to my site ASAP
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:43:28
When I click the Bitcoin link nothing happens. Tried different browsers and also when logged in. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:49:45
Thank you!
This is amazing.
I tried to get people to donate this Christmas with my 25 Bitcoin donation posts. I'm sure yours will stand out and raise more awareness than mine could :) Hopefully it gets others to give
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:12:05
Is that why it's showing one point for all others?
Any obvious bot use will be ignored anyway. 
I say in the OP that likely the most upvoted cause will be picked, but I still need to look into them and decide :)
So it's not just blindly picking the top
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:49:46
If you see the post I already donated 1btc to Andreas today
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:15:34
The both just received an extra 1 million each from u/pineapplefund 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:50:14
Their Bitcoin donation option doesn't work. I've emailed them about it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:24:05
Wikipedia is a great cause.
Thanks for donating to them.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:38:09
Update Day 1:
The most upvoted suggestion was the Electronic Frontier Foundation. I have donated 0.232173 ($2500) to them so far. There's problems with the donation page but I'll keep trying. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:22:48
will check
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:33:58
Hi, will make a new post after making donations for the past few days tomorrow. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:27:10
Take your own advice and think a bit ;)
Even better, read a bit.
You can see I'm donating my OWN money and also showed proof. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:09:28
Open source code allows people to audit the code but it takes a lot of work and time and could be really hard to find any back door or malicious code.
See the OpenSSL Heartbleed issue for example.
Also even if the code is open source it doesn't mean everyone using it is using that version of the code. You would have to download, compile and install yourself as there would be no way for you to verify an app in the app store is using the code you see on GitHub for example.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:44:35
This isn't how it works. All trades are off chain. It doesn't matter how many coins they keep in hot wallet or cold storage. The orders are done on their own software and balances updated on a database, not blockchain.
The only problem that having most funds in cold storage causes is slow withdrawal of bitcoin from coinbase. But that doesn't effect your trading on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:55:30
They were already donated to on day 1, see the bottom of the post.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:24:46
I had a look at it but then the AMA by the person who does it put me off to be honest.
The top voted question was asking what breakthroughs had been done in the last 10 years as the OP said for 10 years they have been saying the same thing.
The reply they got was that it was too complicated for the lay person and that the advances were too numerous to mention.
That's a red flag.
If you are asking for donations from normal people you need to be able to explain things to them and if someone asks how progress is you can't say too much to list. Could have easily just mentioned the biggest one.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:36:40
It is not needed. I gave it as an option, which some people used.
The "pool" has 25.05987098 bitcoin donated to it. 25 of which is mine.
I won't respond to any of your other comments. Some of us are here to actually do good while you are not.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:23:36
Already been in touch with Khan but they are making it difficult to deposit to. Their website donation link is broken and their support keeps sending me generic messages without reading my problems.
If the next response from them doesn't give me an address I can donate directly to then I will have to remove them from the list and donate to someone else instead unfortunately
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:21:13
tried in FF, Chrome and IE in private and normal with no extensions.
I keep getting this

@_date: 2017-12-04 19:19:04
This has been suggested a few times now and looks great. However I can't see a donate Bitcoin option. Do you have a link?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:15:44
I'll try again in another browser just in case. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:25:18
Pretty easy to verify that I showed proof of 25 bitcoin and pretty easy to verify who I am too. I'd prefer people donated themselves but I gave that as an option, and expected little. I know people have donated because of my posts and donations that are also easy to verify. 
There's a lot of good people in this community who are helping others. What are you doing?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:06:43
So say someone wants to buy btc with $ and they deposit $ to Coinbase. Also someone wants to sell btc for $. They deposit BTC.
Coinbase has both the $ and BTC now. 
So when you trade Coinbase just keeps an internal record that user A now has x BTC and user B now has x $. 
They don't need to do anything with wallets or coins for this.
Now these two users can trade many times with other users. Coinbase again just makes an internal note of who owns what but doesn't need to move funds.
Only when you finally want to withdraw your BTC to your own wallet does Coinbase check what their internal balance sheet says you own and then sends you that.
I might have explained that badly but I hope you get the right idea :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:19:14
The reason I went public with these posts was to encourage others to donate too.
People have been donating because of my posts.
We've seen others posting similar donations now too, like u/pineapplefund who is donating 5000+ Bitcoin! His post should hopefully encourage others also.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:00:45


Thanks for the email. I have donated now and updated the list with the tx id. Thanks
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:40:14
I had my RBS account closed recently. They said legally they do not need to give an explanation.
I have had a Fidor account for over a year and never had a problem.
They posted here that they are Bitcoin friendly and don't mind you trading. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:41:25
I'm using the beta wallet. Maybe it's not on their normal wallet site?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:35:30
Hi, odd
It's a segwit address on Trezor. I used Trezor to sign the message without quotes. Maybe there's an issue with it beign segwit address? I'll double check.
Also regarding it not confirmed. I used low fee as it didn't need confirmed in the next hour or anything.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:12:26
You are 100% correct. I should have thought about that more. I will post an updated signed message before tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:23:29
It would be amazing if the mods could do that. I'm not sure what the rules/requirements are.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:07:58
I think you might have misunderstood.
It wasn't to view a specific currency.
It was to view ALL 4 currencies at the same time.
As said, probably not that useful but that's what I developed my app to do. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:52:44
Yeah I agree. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:53:46
Nice site. I actually made an Android app recently that used their api to make viewing on mobile a bit better.
Think I got 2 downloads :)
I had a feature that you might be able to add.
Show the price of all coins in $, £ and Euro on the same page.
So like 5 columns (coin name, BTC Price, $, £, euro).
I don't know if this is actually usefult to anyone so maybe not worth your time.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:10:46
It's entertainment.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:48:54
Why do you group gambling in there? 
Gambling is one of the largest markets for Bitcoin use and has been a huge part of adoption.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:53:56
For context I ran the most popular crowdfunded gambling site of the past few years.
There isn't as much of that going on as you might think (at least on my site) and it is usualy very easy to spot and prevent.
Obviously there are sites and services that do make it easier.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:59:35
Not sure how you thought I thought they were not.
I ran the biggest crowdfunded dice site of the past 2.5 years so I keep an eye on the stats.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:03:48
No problem.
I was just trying to explain to someone who doesn't know what the industry is like. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:45:44
He means FIAT casinos that allow Bitcoin deposits. Sites like ACR.
Those do a large volume of Bitcoin deposits that you can't track as the information is not public.
Also there are other Bitcoooin only sites that are not on your list that claim to have large volume. 
So your site and dicesites.com do only track a smaller percentage of total Bitcoin volume.
Even some on your site like BVC (who licenced their software to Roger) do a huge amount of volume but the figure is not public.
There's too much OTR stuff that you would never be able to get public figures for.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:51:24
Sounds like it's too many but it's not impossible.
There are a lot of Bitcoin gambling sites and the most popular Bitcoin gambling game is Dice.
Most dice sites allow a user to bet between 3-10 times a second.
Some sites can be processing 500-1000 bets a second or more.

My method is to encrypt the seed and then split it using shamir secret sharing.
Then store the parts in multiple geographic locations.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:39:43
Excellent guide. Going to give this a go.
@_date: 2018-11-06 23:40:53
Hi r/bitcoin
I've been working on a new app for a Bitcoin bank and payment processor.
Bitcoin is difficult to use as a payment system and complicated to store securely for the average user.
This app and service aims to provide a variety of easy to use payment methods for cryptocurrency that users will be familiar with from traditional payment apps or their banks.
Here's a short demo showing how contactless payments work on point of sale machines and phones.
We'll be showcasing more features over the coming weeks.
Feel free to ask any questions.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:06:49
That's what I recommend to friends as the best way to get involved.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:19:24
below 2k on stamp now
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:30:22
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:00:59
Yeah. I'm the worse trader.
Tried lending, day trading alts, long, shorting.
I'm down a lot of btc in the past few months doing that so best strat for me is hodl. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:03:37
Good luck. Lost some through that and know a few people who have lost all their money doing it.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:21:37
I got a little tempted and tried to time the markets the past few days. 
Lost on ZCash due to Poloniex website not being able to handle traffic.
Then lost on Monero after the "big announcement" that wasn't an announcement.
Lost around 35 BTC overall to those.
Best to just stick to holding Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:07:50
Hi, thanks for the replies.
First off I apologise for saying "very user unfriendly". What I meant was I think it could be easier for the user if say you just top up account and then get to browse without having to worry about paying. At same time your method does make sense for people in Bitcoin who don't want to trust someone else with their funds.
Regarding the wallet, yeah I would be fine with that. I have secured other peoples funds for a few years now.
I just had this idea as a new project.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:04:08
If you think of it similar to a subscription site where you pay $x a month. 
But you could say deposit x BTC for some amount of views and if you run out you add more credit.
Or you could just pay per view/content but then it would be annoying having to keep depositing every time you want to read an article
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:46:48
I check this sub and a lot of Bitcoin news sources frequently and never heard of any of these so thanks for pointing them out.
PopChest looks good. Not much content though and the featured videos show videos from 2014 and 2015. Some categories have 1 video in them.
WatchMyBit UI could be made easier for the user.
The way I plan would be you just top up your account once a month (depending on consumption) and then just browse the site without any interruption. 
Steemit looks good though not sure about the payout system. The content isn't great on the homepage, mostly about steemit.
Yours was quite difficult to find on google, had to go through a medium.com post to find it and even then there was no url.
Alexandria and LBRY are quite different from what I'm proposing here so can't really compare.
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:03:34
It would actually be off chain. The transactions would essentially be in a database and the only fees would be when you decide to withdraw.
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:49:25
I never thought of it as P2P in the same sense as say OpenBazaar but rather hosted on a central website where publsihers have their own profile/channel but they get paid directly from user viewing their content.
I guess you could think like medium.com and youtube but each time you view a post or video a micro amount comes off your account and goes to the content creator.
There would be an option for the content creators to export their content too if they want to leave the platform. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:35:45
That is actually a little different. I have seen Brave before.
That strips away certain ads and gives you a choice to view specific ads.
I'm proposing an ad free, tracker free, javascript free website as a content portal where payment goes directly to the publishers.
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:52:06
That would be the big hurdle at first.
I would need to approach a lot of content creators and get a decent amount of content on pre-launch.
@_date: 2016-07-29 07:44:39
Get a Trezor. Easier to use and still very secure
