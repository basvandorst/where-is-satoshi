Then the entire block is invalid and gets orphaned. You should simply wait for a few more confirmations for tx that are coming out of an extBlock back into the main chain, to see if they are valid.

Segwit supported?

BU nodes banning each other? It's not a bug, it's a feature!
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:27:22
Please explain. Which downsides would I get with my not updated full node? I was under the impression that I can opt-out of extBlocks? I can still verify all transactions on the mainchain?

If the different miners (e.g. Antminer and Bitfury) are *not* 100% integrated in the same way, there is a chance that we could change the POW with only rendering the Antminers useless. Perhaps there is a function that is fixed in Antminers, but is flexible or could be updated in other miners. Anybody looked into this?

Because most wallets and exchanges are Segwit ready and so blocks will provide more space. IMHO we will get 50% more space in a matter of weeks, demand won't catch up that fast. With blocks not being full, fees will drop quickly.

Would it be possible to use covert Asicboost with 0.14.1 as a non-segwit miner after Segwit activation?
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:06:25
Fees will go down &gt; 80% with segwit. He makes more btc by using asicboost and missing out on the fees of a few segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-27 07:41:22
It's not linear. With e.g. 50% more space in blocks the fees would drop *more* than 50%. In fact, if blocks are not full all the time, you would get your tx in with a 10cent fee...

Yep, it's [here](
"The implementation initially seemed a lot simpler when moving all segwit
behavior to the extension block. The initial conception was to have all
witness programs be entrances into and scripts within the extension
block, but I guess there's no reason we couldn't do something like
Johnson proposed and have different witness program versions be the
ext-block-only programs. It just involves me rewriting a bit of code in
the reference implementation, and backporting a lot of code to the
original branch."
I'd really like to know if they started to rewrite it. There's a much bigger chance for community acceptance with Segwit on mainchain.

Does anybody know if the ExtBlock proposal will integrate Segwit on the mainchain? If they plan to do so, I think it'd be a viable solution. The extBlockchain could be used as the CoffeeChain, the lower security assumptions would't matter that much...

We're already in 6 months of the possibility to upgrade. IMHO we should use BIP149 instead of BIP148, but not with activation dragged onto 2018. Just activate after Segwit MASF has failed, that is still 6 more month to go and enough time for everybody to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:57:22
This. Combine BIP 148 with a 2MB Hardfork that activates one year later (August 2018). Everybody would have enough time to test and prepare (code is already there), and you would get A LOT more people on board...

You want Core devs *personally* to encourage a 2MB HF. Otherwise you would simply fork Core and patch it to e.g. 2MB HF 12 months after Segwit activation and rebase the patch on every Core release. You can even use the HF patch from Luke-jr and only change some numbers.

You can combine BIP148 with a 2MB HF one year later in August 2018. So we would get Segwit soon and after that we can prepare for a HF in &gt;12 months.
