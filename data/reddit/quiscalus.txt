Break it down further, go P2P

I like s2.bitcoinity.org

Shhh.. -it's stabilizing 
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:11:14
Yeah, except this would completely vanquish what remains of MtGox's standing as a 'professional' company.

Yes, every exchange I've used has accepted Bitcoins as a funding method.


The only completely secure wallet, is an offline 'cold storage' wallet, IE: one you manage with the bitcoin-qt client. As for online wallets, Instawallet has been notoriously unstable, but blockchain.info hasn't let me down yet. ( They've even got SatoshiDice integrated, if you fancy losing your Bitcoins )


Exchanges allow you to withdraw Bitcoins to an address you specify, so theoretically you could do it this way, but a better idea would be to keep your spending coins in an online wallet, and do your transactions from there, keep your trading coins in an exchange, and your long time investment coins in an offline wallet.
Get coining!

I'm having a tough time trying to actually GET bitcoins. I know PayPal is notorious for closing accounts for buying BTC, but is there still a service available that accepts PayPal? I don't care if my account get's closed.

Someone just bought two large pizzas.

If they have all the power, they can fake blocks.

People are moving to BF as an alternative to MtLag.

Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Specifically for the Application of Mining Bitcoins, because that's what this Integrated Circuit was Application Specifically Designed to do, Specifically.

Absolutely love the personal messages.

Application-'Specific' Integrated Circuit

Yeah. We all know that it's contraceptive. That only adds to the value of the slogan!

If you need any graphics done for the low rate of free, I could surely help you out!

I've got some vectors too.
[Here's v.1]( and [v.2, now with more outer glow](

Geez! Thanks!

I'd need to correct the aliasing issues in the BTC logo if this were a serious thing, but I thought [this]( would be a pretty cool banner.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:01:19
If you're in the US, use Bitfloor. Their local deposit method seems to be unprecedented in speed and convenience. Plus, no one's yet complained about a 1 hour lag w/ their engine :P
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:04:18
Ah. That actually makes sense. I hope in the future someone finds a way to make getting bitcoins easier.
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:11:23
I was going to insist someone actually scrutinize the coding style of the source. Maybe someone could even back it up against some of the other 'alleged' Satoshi's works.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:04:03
The reason Gox is telling you to wait 12 hours is because that's more than enough time to mull it over and switch to Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:58:54
You could always use the Bitcoin exchanges. They usually have someone willing to convert BTC into Paypal, but be weary of those folk.
Other than that, Fastcash4bitcoins.com.

Being 15 I didn't have any actual money to spend on BTC, but I remember when BTC hit 80 dollars I told my dad "You need to seriously put a lot of money into this" and he told me I was being silly. Welp.

If you want your own website, someone around here is developing a Wordpress addon that'd be good for this. I don't have link right now though.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:48:54
Hey! I didn't know that, I guess that's cause enough for me to go watch it again.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:42:49
I thought that was just the lowest level common clients use.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:32:34
If you head over to you can find the documentation for the bot (sidebar). The bot will let you 'redeem' your comment karma in return for small amounts of BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:09:38
On that settling ordeal, it seems to be *oddly* rock solid at 100. Is this artificial stability?
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:36:01
I made a logo for the campaign in that thread, it's up for grabs if anyone wants it.
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:53:19
Go ahead! I remade it in Illustrator and posted it in another thread if you'd like to use it in that form.
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:07:53
"free" is usually a good sign of that a loss of your goods is about to take place.

When I go to make my first actual USD to BTC exchange, it'll be through the BofA method.
I think that the first person to come up with an efficient, reliable, legal, and quick method of exchanging USD to BTC will hit it big.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:18:15
Could you explain the 'held artificially at ~100 USD' part to me?
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:14:35
Where are we now? Chasm? Early Majority?
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:35:03
Spend. The. Coinz.

Try @_date: 2013-04-14 18:53:08
Try rampantArsonist I'm more likely to check Reddit though.  Oh and, it'd be my pleasure.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:33:38
No idea. The people making Ripple probably do.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:46:48
Sounds a lot like Office Space

If I went to give you a link to every time someone has suggested this, I'd finish up just after the second coming of Satoshi.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:10:32
You really think Bitcoin is in it's home stretch?
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:16:14
Nathaniel "Popper" -heh
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:07:19
Really should change the title. It's extremely misleading.
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:22:14
No. Bitfloor. Don't feed the Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:29:51
I spend it based on principle, but that's an easy thing for me to say, considering my entire BTC portfolio is a couple donations from generous Redditors.
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:39:45
That indicates the end of a block, and gives information about it.
