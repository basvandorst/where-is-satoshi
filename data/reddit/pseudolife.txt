That's a silly way of doing it.  
It kills all justification of lines.

Can someone explain the advantage of calling 1/1,000,000th of a bitcoin a "bit" as opposed to "uBTC" or "µBTC"?

Doesn't the prisoner's dilemma apply to this? The ideal situation is for every person to post and tip, correct? But then the best thing for any one person to do is to never tip.

Not diceware as in the literal string "diceware", diceware as in [this](
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:04:41
That's only if you choose a passphrase based on an actual phrase. If you use something like diceware, it will be just as secure if not better, and easier to remember.

Sorry, I meant over a longish period of time, like currently.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:32:43
Because it is a single point of failure.

Have each wallet have a lockout time that can be changed with proof of both user keys. Maybe even something more complex than that: w delay given x hour on y day of the week and/or day of the month? (This wallet can only be withdrawn from on the first of the month, with a 24 hour notice?)

First off, it's a 160 bit keyspace, not 256 bits.
Secondly, this is assuming classical irreversible computation.
With quantum computation, even just using Grover's algorithm we reduce the keyspace to 2^80, which is feasible in the sense of "should be breakable eventually".
And with reversible computation, we could potentially sidestep the thermodynamics issue entirely.

You are absolutely correct that it puts on rose colored glasses.
But the question is: is that such a bad thing for something like Reddit?

Another example: the default price of gold is given in dollars per ounce. I haven't seen any cry for *that* to change.

Higher blocksize means that there is more of an advantage for miners with a faster / lower-latency connection to other miners.
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:57:52
If your difficulty is set up correctly, a mining pool *couldn't* run up the difficulty much by mining one specific hash type.
For example, if the difficulty is only calculated as the time to mine (N blocks of hash type A and N blocks of hash type B) the maximum confirmation delay with that type of attack would be twice the target confirmation delay.

Here's an idea.
Have a Reddit-like site, without explicit moderation at all.
Instead, have a "voting similarity" algorithm - the accounts who vote most like you (on the things you both voted on) get the highest weighting when generating your front page.
Or, to put it another way, you see the things that the people who tend to vote like you have upvoted.
This could be extended further with an ability to set a vote multiplier on a user.

I said "like currently." Currently, the difficulty changes every 2016 blocks. Or every two weeks or so. Not eery 5 months.
If you have a dual-hash scheme, even if an adversary had *unlimited* hashing power on one hash type, they could only double the difficulty, and hence at worst could double the confirmation time.

Biggest problem is fraud. There'd be more than a few poor sods who buy "1BTC" expecting 1BTC but getting 1µBTC.
And, for what gain? That's the part I don't get. I don't hear people complaining that the tesla (unit of magnetism) is too large, for instance. Or, for that matter, the ounce of gold &lt;&gt; USD exchange rate is higher than the BTC &lt;&gt; dollar exchange rate, and I haven't heard of people complaining about it causing problems.
Don't bother. Use SI prefixes, that's what they're there for after all.

Ahh, then in that case I would run the miner before you would run the baseboard heaters.

Registers? How is the air heated?
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:37:10


To be pedantic, that should be "if the *input* temperature isn't too cold". Ground-based systems in particular tend to run about the same input temperature regardless of outside temperature, depending on how deep the pipes run.
Also, internets are a currency now?
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:25:01
And that is an issue why?
It requires higher transaction fees, which would in turn encourage people to use them only when necessary.

Biggest issue with heating with BitCoin mining is that it can be less efficient.
Heat-pump based electric heaters can get a [CoP]( of ~3.5 (3.5J of heat into the house for every J of electricity used, with the other 2.5J coming from the air or ground), whereas straight resistive heating (among other things, BitCoin mining) is 1 by definition.
Not saying it cannot make sense, but make sure that you have crunched the numbers.

Would if I could...
Anyone have a time machine so I can go back a couple years and tell myself to actually take BC seriously?
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:34:17
True - although generally by the time you get into that temperature range a BitCoin miner doesn't do so hot either
