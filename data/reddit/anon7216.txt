TIL I can gauge my IQ based on how many Bitcoins I own. No need for those silly tests any longer!
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:47
Because it is a free market. A new LN hub can charge a lower fee if they wish.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:23:02
I'd rather have a technical explanation than not. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:32:42
Oh yes, *inverting* bitcoin. Is that what the kids call it these days?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:15
Good decision.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:48:27
Your analysis of the situation is quite logical.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:48:21
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:43:08
Actually, instead of doing that just sell it. I'll buy your coins people.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:31:19
low barrier to entry.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:28:14
I use exchanges outside of my country and don't worry about taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:49:06
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:41:05
It costs to make those dollars, and it certainly costs more to transport them physically to locations. It costs people to count them, costs to keep them secure, costs to make sure they aren't counterfeit. Need I go on?
Cryptocurrency eliminates a lot of that work. It might even mean some people's jobs get replaced in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:51:12
I think what people are referring to is that Wall Street has a lot of money that *could* be used to manipulate the price. When price manipulation happens, it can cause fear in holders of an asset, and those holders might act upon that fear in ways that benefit Wall Street. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:10
I see. I misunderstood your question.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:56:32
I think so too. If a blocksize increase is on the roadmap, what are we waiting for? Honest question. Just someone give me a logical answer to this.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:07:24
I don't get it either.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:09:37
I lost a bunch of BTC from Neo &amp; Bee. Can I deduct that?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:46:08
It's been brought up many times.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:52:18
I understand your point now. Thank you for explaining it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:40:56
Oh I misread. So, the premise is then, a well-connected hub would make more revenue from more tx. The large tx throughput revenue would be enough to offset the on-chain tx for smaller tx rate connections? However, a new hub is forced to charge closer to the cost of the on-chain fee. Is this what you are describing? Sorry, if I my description is jumbled.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:17:01
Maybe you should be CEO then.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:29:09
I used Hitbtc.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:51:25
I'm in the exact same position. I've held all my Bitcoin too. Thank you very much for keeping us informed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:44:16
Yeah me too. Unfortunately, this is what adoption feels like. We're far gone from everyone valuing Bitcoin for just decentralization, security, being your own bank, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:41:08
No one thinks I do "anything" because I don't tell them that I have Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:00:25
Nah, I didn't lose out on dollars. I got a bunch of free BTC. A ridiculous amount. The wallet is stupid and misleading.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:06:59
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:52:37
No, I sold all of mine for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:47:13
Yes. It is a bech32 format address generated using electrum. Do you think I'm not doing something correctly?
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:45:54
This is why some altcoins continue to have "market value" despite there really being "nothing there" from a development point of view. Those coins will not survive.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:54:02
It doesn't fucking say ANYWHERE that he is. Adam Back is a legend in the cypherpunk community. People care what he has to say regardless of whether he works on Bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:57:34
Savings per family: $5,940. 
This is just pitiful. What a sorry state we are in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:15
On the contrary, I think people have been calling crypto a high risk / high reward class for a long time now. Ever since governments started classifying it as a commodity or whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:11:09
I really enjoy thinking about it this way. I find it comes in handy when explaining how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:23:46
I would imagine so :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:24:02
This deserves its own post!
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:04:07
For the brisket!
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:21:51
It's not just the internet. Don't disclose your wealth to anyone (some cases are exceptional). 
If you're driving around in your Tesla with a "BITCOIN" license plate. You are more likely to be targeted than someone who is not doing that. Please people, keep that in mind.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:27:42
It does not change the argument that the default wallet is BCH. You are trying to avoid that point you previously stated by saying "it doesn't really matter".
I honestly don't care about which wallet is default. I care that you blatantly told a lie. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:29:56
Whatever gets the clicks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:16:12
Sorry, but I ..must..
"effect" not "affect".
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:07:14
I just downloaded the wallet. Touched "receive", and the next screen is the BCH wallet receiving option selected by default.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:42:30
This is a fantastic explanation. Thanks for taking the time to write it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:11:46
That couldn't be farther from the truth.
I know the differences because I understand Bitcoin and Bcash on a technical level. New users might not, and I'm serving *their* interests.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:30:59
*Why* hold both?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:37:44
I just hope we get to the front page of @_date: 2017-11-18 21:03:21


Can you explain what you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:33:43
I am so excited for this.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:07:55
I find that this is really a strong argument. Protocols aren't companies, it is software that evolves and becomes more anti-fragile because of the open source nature.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:33:58
Why listen to someone talk about a topic when they openly admit to not being knowledgeable about the subject anyway?
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:54:43
I just want to point out very specifically that the problem here is not a single person. We are all human and make mistakes.
The problem is that you cannot expect a project to be taken seriously without review and proper testing. Thankfully, the bitcoin core team have the correct process.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:00:03
I'm making liberal use of the reporting feature
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:36:36
Basically this.
Engineering, technology, science, etc. No one gives a fuck about emotions or how you "feel" about something because that isn't what matters. The project is what matters.
For all the crypto researches who are "meany heads". Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:35:53
No. It doesn't matter because even if Garzik had made perfect commits, it would still be a project that was conducted in the wrong fashion. That's the greater issue.
I feel like I really need to point this out because there are a lot of altcoins that have a nonchalant development process, and they just happen to be lucky. Eventually, someone will make a mistake somewhere like Garzik did, and it will make its way to production. I don't know about you, but from what I experienced: companies and projects where this happens is the fault of everyone. It's never just a single person's responsibility.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:54:47
You're right.
BTC serves freedom. The other serves to line the pockets of criminal actors scamming people.
Bonus point: bcash isn't going to grow very far unless people develop it. This isn't just politics people. It is software. Bitcoin repo has 500 of the smartest people contributing daily. What do these shitcoins have? Can you name any developers who are worth talking about? Block size scaling is just a tiny portion of a multitude of changes that need to be made for growth.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:23:29
That is correct.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:13:27
A healthy portfolio includes a small percentage in high risk / high reward allocations. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:41:41
There is honestly no good reason that I can come up for keeping it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:39:07
Yeah. That's a pretty negative and unrealistic outlook.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:22:38


Bitcoin dude.


As a contributor to an open source project myself (not bitcoin obviously), I know firsthand that there are always tons of tasks to do that don't require developing, so your point is invalid.
Like I said above. He's done shit in the community. The cryptographer community respects him. If you really don't know, go read about everything he did before Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:38:35
Great analogy!
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:04:01
What if we removed the downvote button temporarily? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:36:52
"Satoshi's vision" is not an argument. You bcash people love to say this, but it really doesn't have any bearing on how software should be developed.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:03:36
Thanks for stickying it. Great to inform everyone what is going on here.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:03:08
I don't want a BCH wallet. The app should be renamed.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:31:35
The bcash is bitcoin argument needs to end. It's like saying Android is Linux. Well, yes, but the public doesn't understand the implications of that relation, and if you expect them to while promoting that rhetoric, then it will lead to confusion and mistakes.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:05:08
TIL: Never make a wager that Bitcoin won't meet some crazy condition.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:29:33
Exactly what an &gt; $8000 per Bitcoin brisket would look like. Hope it was good!
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:43:42
Does anyone know when Gemini will start allowing withdraws to segwit addresses? I filed a support case with them, but I have heard no response.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:43:37
Please post proof once you receive the brisket too.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:31:29
I need more larger sexy numbers please!
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:14:29
Nope. When I tried to do it, it didn't recognize the address as valid.
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:28:13
I wonder why they define it as "virtual" and not "digital"?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:02:07
something something pint something blow over.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:59:28
That is correct.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:03:05
I just sent 1.75 BTC for 30 cents in fees. It was not even segwit and was confirmed in the first block.
