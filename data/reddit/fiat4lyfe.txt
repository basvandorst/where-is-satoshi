If he was in bitcoin he'd've lost money, he sold at $780 for fiat. If you hold money on an exchange it's because you're a trader, not a long term bitcoin holder.
"Hold bitcoin and don't trade it" isn't really a solution for traders.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:28:38
But now they're saying they're going to socialize losses, so even if you had USD you'll be losing out. He said he was in fiat. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:54:05
i will not use this money for good.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:37:29
sounds more like he's being trolled
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:55:49
Tell that to EmptyGox, if they don't have the coins they don't have them. Doubt they'd be able to cover a $90m loss even if they liquidated the company.

Little you can do if you're in fiat, you're not going to withdraw to your bank and then re-deposit every time you make a trade.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:41:07
Of all wallet names, they chose BitGo.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:38:24
Again he didn't leave bitcoin in the exchange, he left fiat.

* It's linked on btc-e's site
* Uses their orderbooks
* Same support system (kayako.com)
* userID format is the same as btc-e mt4 generated userID's and passwords.
* Has Trollbox(tm)
* Twitter link in their email (from registration) links to btc-e's twitter

If you go to btc-e.com and look under "advertising" this link appeared today. No official announcement yet.
@_date: 2015-12-12 14:31:15
How many times has this gif made front page?
@_date: 2015-12-04 01:48:15
Just got word from the admin on the on the xBTCe trollbox.. He described it more as a partnership between two separate companies where they use btc-e to provide liquidity. He didn't respond when I asked him if it was run by the same people.
So they're linked, but for whatever reason they want to keep them as separate entities. From the way they ask for user details such as name, address, phone number, ID etc. it looks like xBTCe wants to be more regulated.

It took about a month to hit $1000 from $200 though

No? I had genuine passport and resident information, I just entered the DOB in the wrong format.
OKCoin was happy to let international customers use their Chinese site until Saturday, where they changed their terms without warning locking people out of their account.
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:29:16
Post where Bitfinex specifically says they would credit users BCH in this scenario: 
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:32:51
Again read the post. All these countries were supported until this Saturday, ask anyone who has been using OKCoin China.
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:28:44
No need to be facetious, I had to call 7 times and have several email exchanges before they let me withdraw.
With potentially more PBOC regulations on the way I'm letting people know it's not a great idea to have money on there right now unless you're Chinese.

It's working fine for me
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:23:43
No mate this is something new, they've increased the fees 20-fold in the past 48hrs and just an hour ago have totally disabled USD, EUR, RUR, BTC and LTC withdrawals
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:51:37
Because the newly deposited USD over the past year is now also under threat of insolvency, it's one thing to take on the debt obligations of the old company "btc-e" and issue them as tokens, but it's another thing to say the USD deposited to WEX since the initial insolvency of btc-e is useless.

[Tradeblock]( reporting 21k+ unconfirmed transactions. Possibly related to the [coinwallet stress test?](
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:52:41
To sell your BTC yes, but if you had USD on there then you just lost a whole lot of money; and in the event of bankruptcy your BTC assets are as good as any USD assets for distribution.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:47:21
No, I mean it dropped to 0.01CNY. See [here](
@_date: 2015-11-10 14:39:29
I'm not the only one complaining, see the weibo page.
2hr 40min now, they normally process pending withdrawals within minutes, I've withdrawn hundreds of times. Other people have been waiting longer.
@_date: 2016-10-02 12:59:23
Thanks for literally re-posting the link of this thread
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:39:46
I think that's a [Multibit]( wallet based on this: 
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:35:41
Odd because when I click that it shows [this]( bottoming out at 1 CNY, but the okcoin graphs which are now edited to remove this, [listed it as 0.01 CNY]( (Originally taken from [here](
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:29:32
Yeah I just pulled all my money out, okcoin wayyy too risky at the moment.
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:02:22
No one can withdraw their coins on BTC-e, some of the evolution coins have made it to the exchange.
Some people were receiving PMs offering coins in exchange for helping to withdraw the stolen coins, looks like some sort of tumbling attempt.
paulgr (in the image above) is a mod on the trollbox, explaining the situation after speaking to the devs.
paulgr: "The support team is in contact with the other main exchanges and all are working together to ensure we don't get dumped on"
tl;dr: Evo coins are making their way to exchanges.
**UPDATE: btc-e have posted the following on [twitter]( Network issue in Data Center. Mail server temporarily unavailable. 
Now I don't know which one to believe..
**UPDATE  Withdrawals are now working!**
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:53:07
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:07:29
No problem, congrats ;)
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:50:09
Ah, then it's probably best you just ask them via support ticket.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:11:37
It's not about the actual domain name being seized per se, you could access it from an IP even if they had no domain name.
The problem is this shows the intents of the US government, they see it as a criminal organisation and want it down. 
Even if they tried to come back up under a different name, they wouldn't last long before being shut down and no business would work with them.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:30:11
The actual exchange won't go back up again I'm afraid, the website's been seized.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:00:46
Done, should be through in a few hours
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:20:42
True, but no one has been able to withdraw for 6hrs now, they're essentially halted.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:38:39
It's possible if someone contacted your mobile provider and using social engineering redirected/transferred the number, I've heard of people losing bitcoin that way.
Coinbase does specify SMS is less secure than TOTP authentication.
Can you receive texts?
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:19:27
It's just the first proxy I found when I googled US proxy, I know some people in the US can see it and others can't.
Give it some time though and it should work, nothing special about that proxy.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:41:58
It was never down as such, but it's still directed to the sinkhole.
Even though it looks the same, it's under US Gov control and everyone who visits it will be logged... I expect an eagle to replace that page shortly
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:17:50
You couldn't even spell it that badly if you tried!
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:16:41
Looks like the domain is no longer controlled by btc-e...




















Read here: [
When liberty reserve got shut down :
 &gt; "On Friday, the domain name servers for Libertyreserve.com were changed and pointed to ns1.sinkhole.shadowserver.org and ns2.sinkhole.shadowserver.org. Shadowserver is an all-volunteer nonprofit organization that works to help Internet service providers and hosting firms eradicate malware infections and botnets located on their servers.


**EDIT: We have an eagle!** [ Make sure to clear your cache first.
If you can't see it then you may need to wait for DNS propagation, [use a proxy to see it for yourself] ( using a US server enter in the URL and hit GO.

Bitcoin deposits on Xapo are fully automated.
Have you checked whether the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain?
Search the deposit address on blockchain.info and see if it has any confirms, chances are you didn't include a high enough fee and need to wait longer for it to confirm.
