Hey, maybe we are wrong, but all of this stuff was not so different with gox.  There was even a lot of talk about a goxcoin. And clueless customer service reps on irc.

Nah, I bet his "bitcache" is some way of accumulating transactions so you don't need to make a real one except periodically. Maybe it's just an account, maybe it's an alt coin, maybe it's a payment channel...

You could sue together with your friend in small claims court. It's a bit problematic because it's not clear who has the claim. Most likely him, but you could have a claim too, since you basically intended to send the money to your friend but instead sent it to a wallet controlled by the scammer instead, because of apple's negligence. 
You probably do have a good claim in my opinion because this is really gross negligence on their part. The apps looked exactly the same and it was extremely obvious it was a scam app. If they had done even a cursory search they'd have stopped it. In many states you can't disclaim liability for gross negligence in a user contract like the one for the App Store. 
On top of that, for Apple to deal with a suit is an expensive pain in the ass. For $15k, they would most likely just settle and give it to you. It would cost you very little. Just document everything you can, go to your local court, talk to the clerk, and file a claim. Follow the clerk's instructions and inform Apple as they instruct you. Apple will most likely either settle right away or not even answer, in which case you can get a judgment and enforce it. 
Since your friend is in Australia and it could create jurisdiction issues, I suggest you just file yourself.

Yes. They need cold storage but also need to audit how much they're moving out of cold storage so they know they're not losing it all to a slow hack. This may be what happened in Gox - fake account balances were created leading to an apparently legitimate loss of cold storage funds for withdrawals, while the amount of funds in storage vs account balances were never reconciled.

Call an attorney in hk. I'm sure they could start a claim for you there. It would cost less than you lost. I'm not sure if they do class actions in HK, but if so, many users could join and divide the attorney costs.

What you really need to do is do a deal with Starbucks to get access to their credit system. I'm sure they wouldn't mind having a way to get a few more users buying Starbucks credit. 
They would probably give you a bit of a deal on it considering that they save so much on credit card fees and increase and lock in sales. Maybe they'd only give you a few percent off but at least that way you could offer people Starbucks for btc in a reliable way. 
Sorry to say but leaving your site nonfunctional for 90% of the time and giving no update for months sends the message that you as a company are dead. It's not professional at all. How long does it take to send a tweet or blog an update once a week even?

Any one of you guys affected by this could call up the FBI. Just call them and try to find out what they're doing about it. At the very least they'll probably tell you either that they're working on it and can't comment or that they do not have any investigation yet.

Why is it so difficult?  Because trading exists. Without depositing funds, running an exchange is impractical at present. 
This problem is solved pretty much. You need most funds in cold storage, audit your cold storage periodically, and that's it. If you want even more protection, manually approve each withdrawal. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 04:05:46
Dude. It's a suggestion. I'm not running your business. You should have approached all of those stores long ago go work out deals. I'm sure that gyft isn't scrounging around for actual cards for every type of credit they offer. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:06:07
I don't think it's criminal. But they could be paying people who are lower tier creditors first, which is a nono. There may be creditors with higher priority claims like major loans to the company who have a right to be paid first. The court would sort that out, and it could make users actually liable to the higher priority creditors if they withdraw their funds and shouldn't have been paid that much. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:02:46
Unfortunately for those who prefer this option, it doesn't matter. 
All it takes is one creditor to sue Bitfinex in court. The court begins bankruptcy probably at bfx's request. There goes their haircut plan. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:47:23
It's not at all. Every decent exchange keeps 95% or more in cold storage requiring multiple people to access and clear records of who and when and how much is transferred. They don't have problems. 
DON'T use an exchange that doesn't use cold storage. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:25:20

Not universal. Breadwallet uses a different system than mycelium and others.

The nodes are decentralized, but the decision about what code goes into each version is not. This is why they could reject a blocksize increase for so many years even when so much of the community supported it. 
Regardless of how many people submit changes to increase the blocksize, a small group of a few people will reject all of those changes.

This is why you need to be able to DIRECTLY spend crypto with retailers. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:35:10
I am firmly convinced that because of all the problems arising from the full blocks, of core had allowed a blocksize increase like 2x, and told people that it was necessary, most nodes would have upgraded. Especially a couple of years ago when we still had time to avoid problems. 
Maybe a small minority of nodes would have decided the bandwidth wasn’t worth it and quit, but the hard fork would have happened.

Of course it matters whether you can buy directly with BTC.  You can’t have financial freedom when you depend on third parties to spend your money. What if they ban you?  You know, not everyone wants to use money for quotidian baubles. Some want to contribute to a political movement, escape tyranny, or buy something that’s illegal but shouldn’t be, or take donations when they’ve been banned by a cartel of payment companies for their ideology. 
As for stealing bitcoin’s name, it’s a fork. It’s a continuation of the bitcoin blockchain. All such forks have claim to the name.

The bank runs before the fed were far less harmful because banking was less centralized. Now we have to tax everyone to bail out big banks rather than let small ones fail. It’s a scam. 
All that was necessary was increasing the reserve requirements on banks to prevent insolvency. But they won’t do this because isn’t it nice to print your own money to lend it out at interest?  It’s a scam.

I wonder who the heck you are and why you are even reading a bitcoin sub. You sound like a boomer economist who came on here to figure out what is going on with bitcoin because you don’t understand it at all. 
Banks create money by lending money they don’t have. It’s no different than creating fake money. It developed in the Middle Ages as a form of fraud - they gave people credit for money they didn’t have on their books - and eventually they lobbied governments to make it legal. 
Having full reserves would make bank runs impossible. You seem to think that is no big deal?

What weird comments here. 
What you need to do is talk to the OTC desk of a large exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or a mining concern, assuming you don’t want to keep the bitcoin yourself. They can set up a deal for your client to transfer them the bitcoin to them and for them to transfer you dollars. If you’re cashing out the whole thing upon transfer, this is the best way. Don’t try to bother with selling it yourself unless you are very familiar with bitcoin.

Can someone please explain why low fee transactions are not ejected from the mempool quickly?  This would make it far easier for people to resend their legitimate transactions as well as remove spam.  
It seems to me that transactions should not sit idle for more than a day.  We should also just kick out everything that would be expected to take longer than a day to clear based on the transaction capacity.

No, not true. 
There are two ways to run a business. Make your product very expensive and try to attract luxury consumers, OR make it cheap and try to attract as many consumers as possible. 
Both are viable, but usually the latter approach makes you more money, because there are more people with less money than there are millionaires. 
BCH is simply trying to take the letter approach - low fees for a huge number of transactions. It’s definitely a viable approach. The arguments against it assume zero fees, but that’s silly. Fees won’t be zero. They’ll be small and add up to a lot if 32MB or larger blocks are filled. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:31:41
First, your post is in bad faith. There is nothing at all I can respect about bald character assassination. Your post has no arguments, no purpose at all really, except to defame Roger.  So even if you were somehow correct about his character, who gives a shit?  That has nothing to do with bitcoin or bitcoin cash. 
Second, you obviously don’t know him. I’m not going to dox myself but I am far far more familiar with his character than you are. Everyone who knows the man personally would find your statements laughable. As I’ve said many times, Roger may be autistically libertarian and a bit divorced from reality, but he is absolutely unquestionably a sincere person who always cared first about the important freedom oriented aspects of bitcoin. The guy can get a bit emotional, but it’s because he really cares about ideals here. He is the farthest thing from a dishonest or scammy person.

This argument makes no sense. It’s frustrating because it seems to be repeated endlessly here. 
The argument is that bigger blocks are only a temporary solution, so we should have no solution. This is ridiculous.

Default or bankruptcy is effectively the same thing, but it corrects for the unrealistically good credit the debtor had previously enjoyed. If the debtor can't pay a debt, it has to have its creditworthiness adjusted downward accordingly. Otherwise, it will probably just continue borrowing and spending unsustainably.

Lending anything more than the money deposited in a bank is fraud plain and simple. It should never ever have been allowed. Not only that, but it’s unfair to the common people who aren’t provided with a government permit to counterfeit and profit off loaning fake money. 
Furthermore, it’s not “necessary” at all. Why do you think we need fake money loans to have an economy?  It does nothing but distort the economy. It’s money that doesn’t exist, and may not be able to be paid back. In most countries when that happens, the lender of last resort is the taxpayers and they are relied upon to bail out banks. Think about that. The government uses force to extract money from its people and give it to private bankers. All to support a system in which they loan out far more money than they have. 
We were lucky that our recent bailouts weren’t worse. They usually have been in most other countries. They also steal money from depositors and call them bail-ins. How can this possibly be justified?  It’s all complete kleptocracy. 
If banks had full reserves, there would be no risk at all, and they would still loan money. They don’t need to loan 90% more than they have and create massive risk to the entire economy and to taxpayers’ savings in the quest for more interest.

The problem in Greece as in many socialistic countries is that people demand from the government (and the politicians promise) more than the government can provide. Then the government borrows massive amounts of money to make up the difference. Then they go bankrupt. 
There are two problems.  The first is that the politicians promised too much, and the second is that people voted them in and wanted that. Really, it's a problem inherent to democracy itself. 
I'm reasonably certain that the pension system in Greece does not operate like a bank account where you just get back what you deposited with a bit of interest from investment. It actually operates like a tax. The poor and middle classes put in very little and get much more out when they retire, while the rich and corporations put in much more. This might work if the tax base was sufficient to pay out all the retirement benefits, but it's obviously not. There is not enough money coming in to pay for what they want to pay out. 
I don't understand why you keep harping on "austerity" and say it's being forced on them when all austerity really means is to live within your means, to not spend way way more than you can possibly take in...  Even if nobody ever gave Greece another loan, they would be "forced" to implement "austerity" because they're ducking bankrupt. Being bankrupt means you spent all your money, and in their case, even more than that - they spent all their money, borrowed more, and spent all of that!
Please tell me how they are not at fault for getting themselves into that situation.  
I'm not really a libertarian, just a realist. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:11:23

Nations all over the world, including the U.S. became prosperous long before they implemented such government welfare programs. It can't be done the other way round.

It's really not about whether it's fair or not.  It's about how much money they have and how much money they need, and how much they are spending.
I think this is a big disconnect between the Greeks and their creditors.  We have a saying in English that "Beggars can't be choosers..."  
The Greeks should not be concerned about whether the deal is fair.  They basically have no negotiating power, but they want the deal to be fair?  "Dear creditor, please give me billions to bail me out, but make sure it's a fair deal, or else I'll....  Oh shit, I'll just be fucked if they don't give it to me."
See, it's not really the creditors "forcing" anything on Greece.  It's just that Greece fucked up and they are out of money!  So they have gone begging to the IMF and EU for more.  But what they're butting up against is nothing more than the simple fact that if you spend all your damn money, you don't have any more.  And guess what?  Nobody else has to give you their hard earned money either.
I do feel for some of the Greek people who are caught up in this, but not for those who demand all these pensions and programs when their country clearly can't afford them.

Fees should be LOWER if there are more transactions, so long as they can be processed, because they would add up to a higher aggregate fee per unit time. The problem is the cap on the block size that prevents this.

It’s not just a broadcast of intent. It’s a signed transaction that the receiver can keep and continue to resend until it’s confirmed if he wants. That is, unless the sender double spends and manages to win out. That’s extremely unlikely with someone spending from a mobile app in a taxi.

That’s true. But the same was also true of credit cards. Credit cards cost more for merchants. They never wanted to accept them in the past.  The adoption was driven by consumers and by credit card companies, together. 
Crypto adoption is also often driven by consumers who want to use it. But it’s also driven by merchants who find benefit in it. There is especially a benefit in international payments and in the avoidance of fraud and chargebacks. Crypto can really save businesses money for these reasons, and also save on cc fees, but they have already mostly accepted those fees as a cost of doing business.

@_date: 2018-08-31 03:20:57
That’s why the original idea was to USE bitcoin - to keep your money in it and spend it and accept it. 
Because of the blocksize limit though, fees skyrocketed last year. It was over $50 for one regular transaction quite a few times. And for large consolidating transactions the fees could be thousands. You can’t use it as money that way. 
Thankfully the fees are reasonable again now, but I am worried if the devs don’t understand this point. Bitcoin should always be usable. We don’t need high fees to pay miners. We need many transactions with low fees.

If they did something illegal, they get a concomitant punishment - that may be prison, a fine, etc.
Since they are already being punished for a crime, any confiscation of money is simply a fine without a justifiable legal basis.  If they want to have a fine, have a fine, but it should be in the law what the bounds of the fine are, and to what extent judges are free to adjust it.  If that's not defined, not only is it a double penalty, since they already got a sentence, but it's a penalty without any upper bound.
Finally, even if it was obtained illegally, it's still THEIRS.  It should be an unconstitutional taking to simply seize it without it being a sentence for a crime, but it simply hasn't gone up to the supreme court yet on that question.

Now that I have calmed down, I will try to explain more clearly; it's just frustrating for people to point at something like this and make a completely ridiculous claim that does not pass a common-sense test.
Everybody includes these liability limitation clauses in contracts, and often they are not well-written.  They are catch-all clauses that people put in to limit their liability when sued over issues with their services.  For example, the site is down and you can't get your bitcoin, so you miss a payment and get a fine.  You could sue them for consequential damages, and they'd point to this clause to say their liability is limited.
This clause just doesn't apply to the explicit offer of insurance covered in other areas of the contract.  The insurance is a separate issue from their wallet services.
To jump to the key point and forget about the construction of the limitation on liability clause, the fact that they have made an extremely explicit statement that your vault coins are insured, together with a lengthy faq about how it works, is more than enough to trump any vagueness in the language about their service liability.  No judge is going to toss out all the other language explaining the insurance because they had a cut-and-paste limitation on liability for their service.

Not true. You could actually hold Bitcoin and ALSO hold a hedge that will pay you some more Bitcoin in the future of the value goes down vis-à-vis the dollar. 
This would be pretty awesome since you could actually still keep your bitcoin in a cold wallet, and if the value dropped, call in your hedge and just deposit more in the same wallet and buy some more hedges for the next period.

I think both BitPay and Shift are great in the US, depending on which you prefer.  They just both have foreign transaction fees I don’t want to eat. 
A nice aspect of BitPay though is that you can use it to pay other card bills via ACH, so you can use a different credit card with no fees, then pay that bill with the BitPay card if you want. ACH transfers just cost a $5 fee.

IMHO, crime and seizure of someone's assets should not necessarily be linked.  I don't think you deserve to become a pauper just because you broke a law.  And the state definitely doesn't deserve to get the money without earning it.  At the very least, it should go to defray general taxes and not into police coffers.
But it will be interesting to see what happens when the prosecutors and courts realize that they can't seize bitcoin without the owner's cooperation.  If they go the route of trying to keep people in jail forever for contempt of court, they will eventually be forced to give in - it's just too contrary to our sense of justice to imprison people indefinitely for refusal to give up a password.

If I am going to use a mobile client, I want to be sure I can get access to send a transaction 24/7 100% of the time.  I can't be sure that your servers won't go down. I've used other clients that relied on bc.i and had outages prevent me from accessing my money. I'm not comfortable with that. 
As for privacy, tor is fine but what I'm concerned more about is access. If mycelium got a Court order to shut down their servers, I would have a problem. If their servers just went down, I'd have a problem. But with breadwallet, I don't have to worry about that at all.  :)

Doesn't make sense to me somehow. 
If I risk 10k and the spread is 2.7%, then P = CS/LGD gives 2.7 * 10^-6, an extremely low probability.

Not a problem. Just look up the website for the court in their jurisdiction via the TOS and look for the small claims division or court. You can call a clerk if it's too confusing. They'll tell you exactly what to do. Usually there's a very simple form you can file. Doesn't matter where you are unless you eventually have to appear. 
But I would first write a letter to coinbase legal dept telling them you intend to sue them in small claims and ask them to return the btc or you will file. They'll just return it. I give you a 99% chance of getting it back that way.

That's the safest way to do it. All you need to do is create the transaction and sign it. You don't need the internet for that. The transaction describes what you want to send and to where. All you need to sign that is your private key. 
When you want to *publish* that transaction to execute it, you have to copy the signed transaction to a connected computer and send it. But that connected computer never sees your private key, so nothing can be lost if it is hacked.

Oh, I figured it out. 
If the credit spread is 3%, there's a 3% risk of default because if you have a default, you get zero, and if you don't, you get 103% of your money. 
Adding those outcomes weighted by the probabilities gives you your 100% initial investment. That's why people are willing to risk their money because if the spread is slightly greater than the risk of default, on the margin you'll take the risk...

I met a guy recently who works for them and does sort of evangelism for the company. 
They have prototypes they are showing so if you run into them you may be able to see one. There's a single button on the USB key that allows you to change the function from printing a single address pair to a Samir secret sharing algo split key (three split keys). There's also a function to access some flash memory like a regular USB key. 
Importantly, the keys are never stored in flash on the device. You plug it into a printer and it generates an image dynamically which is fed to the printer and never stored.  The image just has printed address key pairs and qr codes. 
It generates randomness from the startup state of some uninitialized ram on the device (not sure exactly what sort of component is being used for this).  
Seems like a cool device but could be influenced by surrounding magnetic fields to destroy it's randomness. I'd be a bit worried about that.....

It's easy for you guys to have a selective memory about this.
There were certainly indications that they were having banking troubles, and there were indications that they were stupid about a lot of things including customer support.  If you wanted to conclude it was bad to deal with them based on those issues, you certainly could.  
However, I will tell you that withdrawals and deposits to and from Japanese banks were working fine right up to the end.  Very fast.  It was the international wires that were delayed because of their banking limits.
And the whole thing that led to their shutdown was the malleability problem, which was fixable.  The real reason they shut down was because the malleability issue forced them to take a harder look at their reserves and they went "oh shit, it's gone."  Up to that point, we didn't know, and they didn't know.  All indications were that even though they were crappy coders, they would eventually get the stupid malleability problem fixed.
So it was not _nearly_ as cut and dried as you say.

I disagree. Bitcoin still is far better than fiat for international payments (wires) or simply freedom from capital controls or inflation.
If we all had credit cards fundable or payable by bitcoin, we'd still be in a far better situation because we'd have control of our own money, freedom to do whatever we wish with it, and consumer protection via cards when we choose to use them. That's why things like the Xapo card as well as bitcoin-payable credit cards are going to be great businesses.

This can be fixed by providing Bitcoin instantly; the problem is that this requires _credit_. 
Bitcoin is like cash or gold. It's not impossible to get cash with a credit card, so this isn't impossible, but it is risky for the company and they have to be reasonably sure they will not be taken for a ride. If you're willing to give a company like circle or coinbase the same information you give to a credit card company to verify your credit rating, they should be able to extend some Bitcoin to you on credit, for a fee. But you could never do this anonymously...

This is probably the best in terms of security, and also reliability over such a long period of time. 
Warpwallet or similar algorithms seem good enough.  The real problem in my mind is that for something like brainwallet.org, or other JavaScript implemented algorithms, I wouldn't trust them to work without any differences in numerical computation in ten years. 
In ten years it could be that you'd need some old version of JavaScript or need to rewrite it to emulate the old behavior to get the same result. I just would not trust such a high level script language to be reliable over decades. 
If you really want a stable algorithm over decades, it should be something in C or at least C++, without any nonstandard libraries or dependencies. You'd really want to print it out and put the code on a shelf to be safe, as well as leave it in a few places on the net. 
Considering these factors, it's a lot safer and more reliable to just keep an HD seed phrase somewhere. It could be hidden in many ways, but you can at least be sure that in ten years there will still be code somewhere for handling HD wallets, as it's a standard.

No, not really.  
As a simple example, when a price is stable and then grows quickly, many people who made profits on that move will want to lock in those profits to avoid a downturn.  This creates a sell pressure that moves it back down.
When it goes down quickly enough, the reverse happens (with short sellers taking profits, or people cutting losses).
When these trends coincide, you can see wave patterns which cycle and usually reduce in amplitude until the price stabilizes again, or is affected by outside forces like big buyers/sellers, news, etc.

That's correct. 
A passphrase could be anything you want it to be, but usually not just one word like a password, rather, a phrase that has a bunch of words and is memorable, but is not something from a song or poem that someone could easily add to password cracking tools.  Yes, people do that for sure. 
If you put in a different passphrase, it won't just fail to open like when you enter the wrong PIN. It will generate a different entire wallet based on the different passphrase you entered. People use this for decoy wallets. You can have a little bitcoin in a wallet for one passphrase, and the main wallet under another phrase. Then if someone demands you give them the passphrase, you can believably give them the one with only a small balance.

The assertion that LN would never reduce their fees would be false. 
Sure, some activity on LN would be activity that could not be done on a high fee bitcoin blockchain. But it could go much further than just some of the activity. 
Imagine that fees get so high for bitcoin that everyone just wants to use LN, and that the easiest way is to basically deposit your bitcoin with blockstream or someone else semi-permanently and use their solution. It's possible that people would basically never transact on the chain except initially. They could even have the LN facilitator like blockchain "buy" btc for them by proxy, simply by transferring ownership of btc owned by blockstream to a user. Blockstream would be not that different from something like coinbase with more microtransaction capability...  in such a scenario, miners wouldn't make anything from almost any transactions, because they'd be almost all off chain. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 23:47:41

 It seems that there's no non-artificial way that core could guarantee proof of work algorithms and/or fees for second level networks.  They would have to limit sidechains or other networks in a hardcoded way to only those meeting the miners' expectations. That would never happen. 
BU may win but miners will have to accept that second level networks can't be limited or controlled.

It was my understanding that user nodes follow the longest *valid* chain, so that even if a majority of miners were to not enforce segwit rules and not mine segwit blocks, nodes enforcing segwit rules would always reject that chain.  So you wouldn't even need a majority of miners to follow along, although they probably would.

The argument that there is no imperative to increase block size was disproven by the so-called stress tests. When I send a transaction and it has to sit in a queue for hours before being confirmed, bitcoin is not functioning well, and it's a big problem. Fees aren't a solution to the backlog. 
That happened. Twice!  And it could happen again any time now, because the blocks are so full. No argument for alternative approaches can fix this issue in the past. Bitcoin needs to avoid transaction backlogs yesterday, period.

@_date: 2017-03-20 06:00:31
It really is unclear to me how it will pan out, but if BU ends up being the power chain, and nodes largely end up switching over, core devs will absolutely not enjoy working on something they call "bitcoin" while to all outward appearances it's a hobbled altcoin, and everyone's complaining about BU code quality.

Correct. They have done a ton of work and even devoting a minuscule fraction of that to a block size increase HF would have made it happen over a year ago.

This isn't an argument. If core doesn't like BU code they should write a block size increase HF into core themselves. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:29:40
Then how about trying it and empirically determining when blocks are so big that the network loses some percentage of nodes?   Just reduce the block size on some kind of sliding scale based on reporting nodes and whatever other metrics you want to use. 
But it is stupid anyway because we would at least be in a better position with two megs than with one. This wouldn't have been hard for core to do. They were just too damn stubborn. It wouldn't have harmed the network in any way. And at least it would have shown the BU crowd that core was listening and trying to take the simple steps they could even if they weren't a permanent fix. That would have lessened the anti-core sentiment substantially.

I think the ultimate solution is not really LN, but using faster and cheaper altcoin sidechains for retail and micro transactions, and bitcoin for bigger ones.

It looks like there's a problem with spending your entire balance and relying on the dialog that pops up asking you whether you want to reduce the amount to account for the required fee. 
I am guessing that if you leave enough for the fee in your wallet (don't try to spend absolutely everything) it won't have this problem. 
To get it to reset to the proper state, you should delete the app and reinstall it. It will then properly rescan. You shouldn't have to reenter your backup phrase but you should always have that saved somewhere just in case.

Some months back when there was a big backlog, I sent a transaction to an exchange and it took something like ten hours with what theretofore had been an average fee. 
That was pretty crappy. It was with breadwallet and it got me pretty miffed at breadwallet for having hardcoded fees that were outdated. As well as with the fee rise in general. 
But fundamentally I don't care if fees rise. I do care if transaction throughput is artificially limited when it's not necessary to do so. I believe that it's not necessary to keep blocks much less than four megs, so that is annoying. It was also annoying that I ended up losing out on opportunities because of that delayed transaction.

The point is that you don't want to generally park money in cash and make nothing on it unless you have to. Presumably after the acquisition you will not have 60 mil sitting around losing value unless you actually need that for cash flow.

They have a choice which sales or purchase they will accept and confirm, and what the rate will be. They can easily jack up the rates during volatile times to cover their risk, and not make transactions that will lose them money. 
The problem is if they confirm a transaction and then renege on it. That's what pisses people off. 
This is why I only generally use their instant buy service and immediately transfer out my btc.

No, here's how it works. 
We charge a tariff. It would increase the cost of the Mexican goods. 
However, those goods have to compete with the same goods from other countries. So Mexico can't charge much more than others. They have to eat as much of the tariff as they can. 
So Mexico gets less profit, and Americans shift to other products.

It has nothing to do with the government. The bankruptcy court designated a trustee lawyer who is managing it until the process of investigating the situation and claims is complete. They'll probably be able to pay out something like 20% in the end. The lawyer is charging for his time but doesn't make anything from the appreciation of btc. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:07:41
I generally don't, but I could sell through an exchange, use a bitcoin debit card to spend, use localbitcoins, use a bitcoin ATM, etc. 
If it's a large amount I'd use a real exchange, or coinbase...  Not sure I want to use coinbase for selling anymore since it's a big target for the government now in the US. 
If I just want to park in dollars for a while, I'd just convert some to dollars on an exchange or in something like uphold or coinapult. 
Could also buy gold with bitcoin. Or buy stuff you need from an online seller in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:13:13
I agree with the goal. Unfortunately, as fees increase, it will become harder and harder for any merchants to accept, and fewer people will want to pay with btc except in places with crap money. 
I hope something can be done to preserve the original dream of bitcoin.

Definitely go down to the courthouse and file a smal claims case. The clerk will help you. You won't need much. Just their address info and everything.  Then you'll have to serve them with the summons when it's issued. 
Now they may just settle up at that point and you could dismiss it. Or they may choose to push he arbitration provision. If so, the judge will require you to do arbitration. All of this is costly for them and they'll never bother for this amount most likely. It's worth it for you and for them to see that people are getting fed up with bullshit.

All true. Maybe I was a bit too harsh saying 2% is ridiculous, but I honestly don't see why a percentage of high amounts is warranted where bitcoin is used for transfers. I shouldn't have to pay 2% on 15k or 20k. That would really seem like unearned profit.

Yeah, as far as I'm concerned at the moment, no possible harm that could be caused by 2x is worth fighting it and causing a contentious fork. Core should just take a chill pill and go with 2x.

Well, it can be really easy if it has been set up that way, but usually you have to enable the keyboards in a control panel before they're accessible just by a key combo. On a Mac, you choose them in the control panel and then you can hit hit option-space to flip between them. On Windows it's control shift, I believe. You probably didn't do that by accident unless you have at least two keyboards enabled.

@_date: 2017-01-24 19:44:02
It's just one of those things where the timing has to be right. At the moment people want to save bitcoin more than spend it, and there aren't that many yet. Far more than in years past, but not enough to satisfy Amazon. 
Over time as more and more people keep some bitcoin, a percentage of them will want to spend some from time to time. Then the demand for retail support will increase. Or other payment services will start supporting it to charge their accounts.

Agreed. 
10k is about the amount I think it takes to move to an new city, get set up with what you need, and find a new job. Who knows when you'll want or need to do that?  It's very important these days to have that kind of cash sitting in the bank for when you really need it. 
You also need to develop credit.  So I'd suggest putting your emergency money in the bank, and developing your credit, and then considering how much to put into btc.

It really must have been the volume or pattern of purchases. I have bought and sold bitcoin through BoA for years and never had a problem. I've done large wires (five figures) as well as smaller transfers with coinbase and other exchanges. 
But I keep the frequency pretty low. Like no more than a few times a month, usually one or two a month. Never had an issue. I think they get suspicious when you're doing things at a crazy frequency or in very weird amounts, or obviously if the amounts are "structured"...  
Arbitrage by doing mass wires all the time will get you kicked out. They just don't want the risk of that kind of activity. You could probably do it once a month and be fine though. 
And obviously never ever mention bitcoin to them. If asked just say it's for trading or a trading exchange. Never mention bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:11:41

@_date: 2017-08-10 00:36:15
I'm aware of the risk of forks in general. That's why I think core should simply support segwit2x. I haven't heard any good argument against their doing this.

The receiver doesn't have to have an address. 
The transfer is off chain.

Firstly, the highlighting doesn't show on mobile. 
Secondly, my IQ is over 145 so I'm not a moron. 
Thirdly, here is my point. Please try to focus and hear what I'm saying. Regardless of the fee one pays, if you pack the maximum number of transactions possible to pack into a block, there is a maximum number of LN channels that could possibly be opened or closed per block. That's a simple fact. 
Therefore, if that maximum is approached, the fees will rise to a point where there could be a lot of people waiting to establish LN channels or simply giving up on it for cheaper solutions. That's because there is a limited block size. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:56:18
I haven't done a lot of wires for a while but I used to do a lot to Asia from an American bank, and they were between $50 and $80 iirc. You may be right that they were skimming on the exchange rate though...

There are certain cases where it might be nice. For example, there's a demand for clean freshly mined coins. A miner could transfer freshly mined coins to an opendime, and they could be sold and transferred many times without showing any transactions on chain.

@_date: 2016-12-09 15:36:38
Yeah no shit. 
Bitcoin only as digital gold means inevitably that you are always subject to government regulation to spend it. Because it has to go through a regulated exchange every single time you want to use it. 
Always subject to government regulation. Does that sound like the freedom bitcoin promised?  All this talk about decentralization is moot if every time I want to spend my bitcoin I have to go through KYC/AML and pay taxes and whatever other regulations may have been implemented, including possibly banning it. 
If bitcoin is only a store of value and not money, it is completely controlled by government and will never give us any real freedom. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:18:28
That's your choice, but coinbase has been known to prevent people access to their own accounts from time to time. I don't like the idea and that doesn't give you the freedom that is part of the whole reason for bitcoin. 
With great freedom comes responsibility. Just keep your recovery seeds safe, offline, and in more than one place, and you'll be fine. 
Regarding banks, remember that even if your bank credentials are stolen, banks can refund you. Bitcoin is up to you - if it's stolen, that's it. So keeping your passwords and seeds safe is even more important than doing so with your bank information.

Why does trezor use a 24 word seed when other HD wallets only need 12 words??
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:14:56
Bitcoin has a number of features that could make it more desirable to hold than gold. 
First, it can't be confiscated as easily. In India right now, people are being threatened with criminal prosecution for holding too much gold. The government will confiscate anything over the allowed limit. 
Second, it can be used to buy foreign goods over the Internet. Hard to do with gold. 
Third, it can be transported easily and secretly. All you need is some paper and 12 words, and you can access your entire savings anywhere you go. Gold is very hard to transport in larger amounts and is very hard to keep secret. 
Fourth, gold can be easily stolen. Bitcoin can't in most cases. It can be password protected and seeds can be backed up. 
Fifth, it can avoid capital controls. One can provide services over the Internet for bitcoin and receive income even in a nonfunctional domestic economy. 
And there are even more probably. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:48:11
It's very safe in the near term. 
The question is how long term you're talking about. In five years, Trezor could shut down and ledger could be the top hardware wallet. Things change. 
Because of that, you need to keep abreast of what's going on with the company for these things. You can't just put your trezor in a box and leave it for ten years. At some point they may inform people that your model will no longer be supported, and you will have to transfer to a newer model or get a different hardware wallet. Those are the only real concerns IMO. 
However, if you really do want to just put it in a box and forget it for ten years, you need a BIP 38 paper wallet. That will be importable into anything forever. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:44:29
It doesn't use any other tokens. It's bitcoin in an address. You're just transferring the private key around on the device. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:15:57
You should go watch the vids on their site. 
It's empty when you get it. You plug it in and have it generate a public and private key, but you don't get to see the private key. It's kept secret on the device. 
But it shows you the address, so then you can load that address with whatever amount you want, and then pass off the device to someone else. 
The people you pass it to know it's safe because the private key hasn't been exposed to anyone yet. They can plug it in to check the balance. But if they then want to sweep the whole balance to another wallet or something, they break a piece off the device and it will then tell you the private key. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:20:57
The point is that people can pay me fine whenever they want with a bitcoin address. I don’t have to be online. I can just provide a public address and go on vacation. But if I ask a friend to pay me then we have to coordinate a time for both of us to be online. It makes p2p commerce a lot harder. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:20:28
This is easy. 
Just tell him to make an account at bitfinex or another exchange like them. Okcoin works too. Just choose the one you trust more. I don't trust bitfinex as much as even okcoin now. 
Move your btc there and sell for usd. Leave the usd there. When you want money to spend, exchange to btc again and move to a local exchange to take out local currency. 
Could also do it with a service like uphold. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:48:22
there's actually some way you can query it and get it to respond in a way that cryptographically proves it's authentic.  they have info about it on their site somewhere, or you could ask them.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:46:36
The only reason they'd have to charge a percentage is if the exchange charges a percentage. But exchange fees are never more than about 3%, usually 1.5% or so. 
They could easily charge a fixed fee that would cover the 1.5% and give them a profit per transaction. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:21:49
I think it would effectively end all calls for you, not just spam calls. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 02:40:58
They will make a lot more from many small fees for more transactions than from vastly fewer large fees. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:09:12
I mean a fixed fee per transaction.  If I make a transaction of 100 btc, it doesn't cost them any less than a transaction of 500 btc. Why should I pay more for the 500 btc transaction?
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:47:58
My point is that the costs increase based on the number of transactions, not the *amount* of each transaction. Sure there are more coats involved in serving 1mil transactions than 10k transactions, but I don't see why one transaction of a different amount would cost more.  It's just a matching engine chugging away. On average each transaction probably takes about the same computing time. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:44:29

There may not be that many lightning nodes and they could cooperate if they have the same agenda, e.g., if they are mostly commercial businesses that want to block certain types of speech or economic activity. They could share data about IP addresses and bitcoin addresses. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 05:48:45
There is a finite block size. QED. 
I guess I should clarify that I meant transactions as bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.  Block space is also required to open lightening channels. Therefore the number of channels that can be opened or closed per unit of time is similarly limited by the block size. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:41:37
Yeah, someone should just set up some ATMs with fixed fees for transactions. It really doesn't cost them much more for higher value transactions. Just make it all a fixed fee regardless of the amount.

It’s going to be a different beast than “bitcoin” alone. For example you have to be online to receive a payment and you have to depend on businesses running lightning nodes that will charge different fees and potentially block people or certain addresses from transacting.

I generally trust hardware wallets nowadays, but I didn't even trust any mobile or desktop wallets, even core, back in 2012 or so. It was just too beta and too likely that a wallet backup could get corrupted or a bug could wipe a private key, I judged at the time. 
That's why back then I only used self generated keys and paper wallets. It minimized the possibility that bugs or malicious software could cause a problem. 
If I were holding for long term, I still think that's absolutely the smartest way to go in terms of avoiding software problems. Print a private key, BIP 38, QR or text, and just put it away in a safe place.

Fees are so high because the core developers have refused to increase the size of the blocks. That is why bitcoin cash forked off and made a coin with 8x the block size and the ability to increase further, while others are trying to fork on 11/16 to double the block size. Even if it’s not a long term solution, fees being this high is bad for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:26:51
You just undermined your whole argument. People need to spend money whether they want to or not.

My marriage was horrible for a long time. My wife was basically mental. She was a horrible bitch. Finally, I dropped the hammer and said she couldn’t come home. She went to stay with relatives and planned to enter a psychiatric program.  After the treatment she begged to come back and apologized for being a flaming bitch. 
Would she have done so if she had all the cash she wanted?  Fuck no. Most of my money was in bitcoin and she had no clue how much. In the very worst case I could have moved to Thailand and enjoyed the decline. But luckily she came around and saw the error of her ways ONLY because I kept control and because she realized she was up shits creek. It forced her to reckon with her problems. Otherwise any woman will just make up rationalizations and continue to be a crazy bitch. 
Basically, btc saved my marriage by giving me back control of my finances. Hail Satoshi.

Even index funds have lost a lot of money for people if you were invested at the wrong period of time. And arguably even you are not making much if inflation is higher than the official numbers.

@_date: 2015-08-04 03:48:30
No, for things like this it doesn't matter what the devs do. It only matters what the running nodes do. People will not upgrade to a version that hard forks by increasing the number of coins. They will keep the same clients and develop their own branch of the code base. 
As well, even if the current devs released such a version and caused a chain fork, nobody would use the 'new' inflationary forked chain because their money would be worth less every block than in the old chain. It would be dead in the water.

Yes, but really they're just ticking boxes. Tell them what they want to hear and you'll likely have no problem.

It isn’t an experiment. Segwit is incomparably more complex than just bumping the block size. Even if they wanted segwit for lightning, they should have given some consideration to actual usability.

A lot of the available metal cold wallets are laser engraved and they are mostly of poor quality. 
When I've received them, often the QR codes don't scan, and the engraved images have jaggy edges and are just not great quality. The exposed metal often has patterns or discoloration maybe from the laser process that make them look bad compared to a clean polished metal. 
I would love to have some very nice quality cold wallets with very readable QR codes, printed keys, and maybe custom text and images.

Bitcoin is a historic shift of power in many ways, and this is definitely one. 
Women don’t give a shit about technology or crypto in general. This is a chance for men to reestablish their independence. And eventually, patriarchy, the most successful social system in history, because it’s based on our nature as men and women, rooted in evolutionary biology. 
Now women can’t divorce rape men. It’s impossible. If you keep your funds in bitcoin or other crypto, they simply can’t take it. I wouldn’t advocate breaking the law, but sometimes the law is patently unjust and men need to maintain power to avoid being reamed by hypergamous and disloyal women. One guy on YouTube was about to be raped this way and managed to move to panama and still have a life. 
Men, hold your keys. Patrol dem thots.

Ok, I was a bit flippant in my post, but here's a proper surrebuttal. 
To your last point, we may be making more, and it's not going to the middle class?  Why not?  Because wage competition with low cost labor drags down wages, and that includes low cost labor overseas, such as in China. The solution is to stop immigration and raise tariffs on goods imported from countries with low cost labor. Then more of that profit would be going to middle class Americans. 
If taxes have gone down, debt has gone up. Many states have seen hospitals close because of the demands put on them by free emergency room care.  There are many other costs of dealing with illegal immigrants as well. 
I don't know where you live, but Hispanic immigration has turned many good neighborhoods into bad neighborhoods. I've seen it first hand. It's not about choosing a good area. It's about destroying previously good areas. And the fact that you simply accept hat there should be such bad areas is telling and sad. In Japan, there are NO bad areas. Seriously. Really. 
Alright, I won't say that there hasn't been an increase in quality of life to some degree. Certainly moore's law has helped. People have better and cheaper things. But I still maintain, although it's difficult to quantify, that industry and labor are fundamental to the economy, while consumer goods are quite secondary or tertiary. Having know how, profitable industry, and stable jobs are essential, much more essential than having cheap phones or TVs.

We used to need that because fiat currencies were limited in amount. It was difficult or impossible to divide them into smaller denominations. 
Bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places and more if we extend that. There is no need for further money supply.

Trying to trade gift cards and do all this cash deposit stuff is WAY more frustrating and complicated than just using coinbase and circle. 
First time users should have a good and simple experience, and not feel like it's a major pain in the ass. 
Localbitcoins and paxful certainly have their place. They're great if you want anonymous coins. But I don't think that level of anonymity is necessary for just placing an ad.  Nobody is going to subpoena circle for escort advertisers' names. It's not illegal to be an escort!  Prostitution may or may not happen in escort encounters and the cops have to catch them in the act. 
I maintain that it would be WAY easier and better to just introduce them to coinbase and circle FIRST. Once they are experienced users, if they want more anonymity they should consider localbitcoins or paxful...
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:54:12
There is no guarantee that low fees will make it through eventually. Recently when Bitcoin Cash was more lucrative to mine, the mempool backlog skyrocketed and its still pretty high. If transactions aren’t mined within a couple of weeks, they are dropped and you have to try again. I’m not playing that game - I need them confirmed in a reasonable time for a reasonable fee. It shouldn’t cost as much as an expensive atm withdrawal. The network can easily handle some increase in block size. Should have been done years ago. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:25:35
This is really interesting. I think that hookers might just be able to swing buying some btc from circle to place an ad now and then. 
So then what happens?  They learn about how awesome Bitcoin is, and start accepting it for jobs. They can now turn it around into ads at backpage again. 
Imagine 9 mil a month in extra demand, plus increasing adoption and holding by prostitutes. Could be a real positive feedback leading to growth.

imho, this is actually a shitty way to stimulate an economy, and it's been demonstrated that it doesn't work well and causes bubbles.  look at the situation right now - the fed has pumped insane cash into the economy, just as japan has, but what's happened?  The banks sit on it.  There are no good investments for it.  It goes to crap investments that create bad loans that end up setting up a bubble for another crash.

Was "the world wide web" defined by NCSA Mosaic?  Or Netscape?  Was Internet Explorer "not" a "real" world wide web browser because it introduced some non-standard features to HTML?
Guys, we are going to see many clients.  We need to develop an organization akin to the W3C, but regardless of what we come to a consensus on, there are going to be nonstandard extensions and clients and it's going to be a bit messy.
I remember when everyone thought embedded images were destroying the web.  Too big, too slow, wasting bandwidth.  Everyone said it was horrible netiquette to include images on a web page, and many argued that it shouldn't even be allowed in HTML.  
The block size has to increase, but the developers lack a successful process and organizational structure to achieve an accepted decision.  You need to form an organization that publishes a bitcoin protocol standard just like the standards for HTML and other web protocols, because there are going to be many clients.  And your organization has to use some accepted parliamentary rules and voting system to reach agreement and manage itself successfully.

I disagree. There's generally extremely little need to discuss anything related to decimal measures of bytes in computing. Everything is easier as powers of two.  Hard drives used to use that measure and so did network data measurements. 
PLUS, since the base two definition had been the only definition of megabyte, etc, since the beginning of computing, they should have left that intact and used the ridiculous monikers such as "mebibyte", which people are too embarrassed to actually use in conversation, for the decimal measures.

It's very interesting. Netflix is putting pressure all around to stop the use of vpns and dns redirection because _their_ licensors are putting pressure on Netflix to help enforce their international exclusive license restrictions on content. 
I used to use unblock-us.com. It's super easy and way simpler than using a VPN if you're just using it for devices like Apple TV or game consoles. They used to advertise all about the services you could use like Netflix and Hulu and clearly boast that they all worked right on their main pages. I just checked the site again and all that is gone. Clearly they made the changes to avoid the fallout from this Netflix push.

First, they weren't lazy. Second, there was never any confusion at all. 
Base two quantities made so much more sense that it was the only natural choice to use such prefixes with base two quantities. Nearly everything done early in computing Thad to be done on boundaries such as 1024 bytes, because to arbitrarily use decimal would have been computationally far more complex and less efficient. It's the difference between shifting bits to calculate memory bounds vs doing a bunch of stupid multiplication.

Ok, I am an engineer and a computer scientist but not an economist, so please ELI5 for a sec. You sound like you know what you're talking about but it is hard to follow. 
So an increase in interest rates as volcker implemented would according to standard wisdom cause a restriction in credit and therefore a reduction in the effective amount of money available for speculation, etc, resulting in curbing inflation, right?  Can you explain succinctly why this isn't the case?  You're saying that inflation should actually have risen but it didn't because it was extreme enough to force mass layoffs and the failure of manufacturing businesses?
I mean, basically doesn't increasing rates decrease the effective money supply, leading to deflation?

Not necessarily true. Blockchain.info is old enough that it didn’t used to be an HD wallet. It just kept a collection of random addresses and keys in a wallet file. It usually backed up to your email though. 
Check your email for wallet backups and check to see if you wrote down a seed phrase of 12 or 24 words.

Sometimes the most capable engineers’ idea of what is “responsible” and “necessary” is based more on their sense of what is right in their mental image of an elegant system than on what is practical and effective under the circumstances. 
This is why we moved away from developing massive specifications and object diagrams in UML to a more agile development process - developers in design mode tend to over design and be overly cautious. 
It is important to look at practical considerations and consider all use cases of the users of a system. Core is not doing that. They are rejecting many use cases in favor of their vision of the software, when in reality both could be accommodated, at least for now.

The thing people never realize about this is that good governments can fail and change quickly sometimes. 
I would not be surprised if we had some States secede within our lifetime. I would not be surprised to see something akin to a partitioning and migration of people to split the United States within our lifetimes. We are fracturing and I really don’t think it can last another hundred years like this. 
Even if you think the US government is reasonably legitimate and fair now, that may not be the case in 50 years, or after some major disaster. Just look at governments in the balkans or even Russia - there are many places in the world where governments are corrupt. If ours started becoming a kleptocracy, that reverence for the law we have would disappear very quickly. When the law is blatantly unjust, it’s obvious and people just say fuck it. When the principle and the legitimacy is gone, it’s everyone for himself. And you’d better catch on quickly or your kids will be hating life.

I highly value he decentralized trustless nature of bitcoin. 
However, transaction throughput should not be artificially limited where it’s not harming the network. 
The key question is how big blocks can be without deleteriously affecting the network, and to what extent. This is a purely empirical question!  And so far as I’ve been able to gather, much larger blocks are possible without damaging decentralization. At the very very least, 2-8 megs should be fine. 
So I cannot but conclude that it’s a mistake to limit blocksize in this way. Since the question is empirical we can also take a look at what happened to usage when blocks became full - it’s pretty clear. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:03:32
More like other altcoins. If bitcoin fees are that high, you’ll have to send a massive amount periodically to the other coins used on a daily basis for low cost items. 
Unfortunately there are tons of use cases for low cost transactions that should be done with crypto andcould be done with bitcoin if it were scaled as is.

Remember that when there is confusion in any field, that's when government comes in and tries to regulate everything. This sort of confusion would be a perfect excuse for them to regulate the actual creation of new coins or of forks. 
This is why it's such an IDIOTIC idea for people in the community to be stubborn and divisive. Core should have compromised with the NYA people - they already compromised all the way down to a 2x bump and core refused to budge in their position EVEN THOUGH they themselves have said that 2MB would not be a problem for the network or a huge centralization concern.  A big clusterfuck with a fork is opening the door for Uncle Sam to come in and fuck with all of us and I absolutely don't want that. 
Although I do believe bitcoin needs more on-chain scaling, at the moment it's more important to make sure there is only one bitcoin. Clearly different altcoins are perfectly fine. It's the confusion and uncertainty that is a problem. That's why even though I support NYA as an idea and a plan, it should be canceled and these guys should establish a forum with the core devs to discuss things and agree on changes. Core should allow other stakeholders to have some say in what gets implemented if they have legitimate concerns and their needs won't harm the network.

There are also legitimate arguments as to why something like Bitcoin Cash is desirable. 
For example, the transaction rate it can support is much higher now than bitcoin and the fees are pennies rather than dollars.

Certainly. Nobody has created a great technically innovative paper bill for this yet, but it's certainly possible. 
Rather than turning them in for Bitcoin, there should be a way that the bill or coin could be irreparably destroyed and the private key extracted from it. Then you could just rip open the bill and get the Bitcoin whenever you wanted. 
It should be noted that this does require trust in the printer though, because they would have access to the private key initially. If they kept a copy of the private key, they could rip the bitcoin from the address whenever they desired. However, the public address should be prominent on the face of the bill or coin, so one could always check it before accepting it.

That may have been the intent, but he language is extremely broad. It would cover snowden since he harmed the execution of affairs of state by releasing sensitive confidential information. I'm pretty sure they already froze his assets in the U.S...
And if you donate to anyone whose assets have been frozen, you violate this order and can have your assets frozen. 
Furthermore, it prohibits conspiracy to avoid or elude the asset freeze. This could be applied to ANYONE PARTICIPATING IN THE BITCOIN NETWORK.
Seriously, do not put it beyond the DOJ to use executive orders or other laws in ways not initially intended if the language can be made to fit the situation.

You could do it in many ways.  THe scratch way would be prone to getting rubbed off inadvertently.  You'd have to build it into the bill.
For example, with a coin you could make it out of aluminum with some other metal embedded in the middle, and then melt the aluminum portion away to get the private key off the smaller coin inside.
The trick is that you would have to do it in a way such that they couldn't just take the inside part and put a new aluminum shell around it to make it look original.  There would have to be parts that would fall out of alignment or fracture when it is done...  something like that.  Maybe the inner coin fragments would have to show through in a specific way that would be very hard to realign to re-create the coin after it was destroyed.

You're talking about how things actually work in other markets, not on btc futures exchanges. 
In this business, there's no difference between a margin call and liquidation, so the distinction is meaningless.

Not true now. You can set up two pins with one passphrase each. Then on top of that you can enter passphrase a manually (which is more secure than entering them on a computer, but a pain for long passphrases to enter on the ledger...). 
I don’t think most people use more than two passphrases usually.

Follow the directions to do it offline so you can be sure that there's no chance your private key or pass phrase can be exposed to hackers or malware. 
Choose the encrypted bip 38 option and enter a secure but memorable pass phrase for your encrypted private key. This will generate a private key that's encrypted with the passphrase so that even if someone got your key, they would also need the passphrase to import it into their wallet. 
Later when you want to import it back into a wallet on a phone or computer, you can do so by scanning the QR code and entering your passphrase. Most wallet software now supports importing bip 38 paper wallets, e.g., blockchain.info, mycelium, breadwallet, etc. 
The only other caveat is to be careful when you re-import it to some wallet software. You can have problems if you try to transfer only some of it instead of importing (sweeping) the whole amount. To be safe, when importing it back into wallet software, transfer the entire amount. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:45:16
I see it the other way around. Bitcoin Cash has obviated the need for another fork because it has larger blocks now and allows miners to create larger blocks in the future by consensus.  If that's what people want, they can now use Bitcoin Cash. No need for a mere 2x bump and another forking mess.

I was on an outing recently, and opened my phone to see a message about my Apple ID being used on another device. Unfortunately, my thumb was too quick and I dismissed it before I realized what it was. 
Fucking freaked me out after all these cases of people hacking apple accounts to get to 2FA and/or other email accounts. 
I tried to change my Apple ID password and thought the security questions had already been changed. Freaked me out 10x more. Maybe I just forgot them, but I wasn't sure...
So then I had to reset my security questions, and I'm fumbling to find three questions that make sense for me and choose three answers on my phone before I'm locked out...  Then I move on to my other key accounts and have to fumble around for minutes to figure out how to change passwords in the mobile site versions...

I agree with being somewhat careful, but I don't agree with endless discussion when there appears to be an issue that almost everyone agrees needs to be addressed.  This is why organizations have boards and votes and minutes.
If the existing BIPs on block size have been rejected, why?  If you don't have any record of the reasoning, it's not a robust process.  If another BIP needs to be proposed, have you requested further proposals and set a deadline for making a decision on *some* reasonable method of increasing block size?
A conclusory statement that the existing BIPs are not the best solutions is insufficient to justify doing nothing.  If there are reasons the existing BIPs are insufficient, they should be documented and it should be documented who made the decision and how.  If (as it seems) there is consensus that block size needs to be addressed, are you going to wait for the perfect solution to fall into your lap, or request proposals and set a deadline to choose among them?  If you don't have a deadline to choose A solution, from among the available options, you're just not solving the problem.
@_date: 2016-10-02 23:24:32
Yes, you should still receive the benefit because it's an incentive to marry. That creates a higher probability you will have children.

This is not exactly true. 
If you look at the chart of the entire period in log scale, you’ll see that the run up in 2013/14 had two parts. The peaks and bases over the entire period represent a long term log channel which I mention below. 
The first push crashed back to the middle of the long term log channel. Pretty much right in the middle. Then it pushed up to the final ATH, higher than the first, at a bit over $1000. The two plus year bear market followed this second run up. 
This time, we went to 20k and again crashed back right to the middle of the long term log channel. It’s very possible that there will be another push up again before a long decline leading up to the next halvening. I personally think we will see at least a good bit over 20k before a long term bear market - maybe 25-35. 
BCH is a bit of an unknown here that could affect things in surprising ways though.

Ok, this is bullshit. And I am agnostic regarding which crypto is most popular. 
First. Nearly every recent fork of bitcoin is named “bitcoin something”, because it is a fork of bitcoin. 
Second. It is debatable which of the two follows the original plan of bitcoin most closely, because they emphasize different priorities. 
Third. IF you think bitcoin cash hews more closely to the original vision, it’s arguable that it’s more bitcoin than the main chain. I personally don’t agree - I think they should use bitcoin cash as the name, not bitcoin, but IF you believe that, then it’s not an insane view, so it can’t be “fraud”, as some people are arguing.
Fourth. Bitcoin cash isn’t a scam because it’s essentially the pre-segwit bitcoin code plus larger blocks. If it’s a scam, so was pre-fork bitcoin imho. Roger doesn’t care about scamming people. He’s already wealthy. He may be naïve and idealistic, but he cares about voluntaryism and monetary freedom. That’s why he’s doing this.

"Negotiable instruments" has a very specific legal definition in common law countries. In the US, it basically means checks or notes that can be endorsed over to people or endorsed to the holder, becoming a beater instrument, but there is specific language required on them to fit these definitions under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code).
Bitcoin absolutely does not fall under the definition of a traditional negotiable instrument.  There would have to be a bunch of quite interesting cases fitting convoluted UCC language to bitcoin before it could be found to fit that definition.

We usually say "frugality".
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:40:44
This is false. 
If block size were large, and there were no more reward, how would a miner choose his transactions?  Generally in order from highest to lowest fee, right?
But he doesn't want to mine if he's losing money. So regardless of the block size, he will not mine blocks that are losing him money. In other words, if the highest fee transactions he can reasonably fit into a block are not enough to cover costs, he will shut down rather than mine. He will shut down and wait until he sees high enough fees being paid. 
Thus, there is no need other than pure technical capacity of the network and centralization concerns to limit block size. A fee market will still exist after block rewards disappear regardless of block size. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:10:39

This system is no longer simply about what the best technical solution is, because if it's never implemented, it doesn't matter how awesome it is. 
It's about getting enough stakeholders on board to actually implement something. A minimum viable solution according to what can actually be agreed to. 
Core devs simply don't have the ability to decide on solutions without reference to actual ability to implement anymore. They must support a solution that can actually be implemented quickly to solve this problem at least in the short term. It is critical now.

His response presupposes that miners are mining low fee transactions.  If a miner simply sets a minimum transaction fee for transactions he's willing to mine, there certainly can be a non-full block with a few transactions with sufficient fees and no near-zero fee transactions included.  It just depends on the policy of the miner or pool.
If miners won't mine transactions for under a certain fee, then either other miners will, or people will raise their fees.  
Let's say there are three pools which each control about 1/3 of the total hashrate.  If pools A and B say that transactions under $1 won't be mined by them, then people know that their chance of being confirmed in the next block drops by 2/3 if they pay a fee below $1.  I submit that many of these users will then pay a fee sufficient for these miners to mine their transactions regardless of the block size.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:16:17
This is hilarious.  You don't understand bitcoin.
Now that it's decentralized enough, bitcoin is not a system that allows anybody to choose the best technical solution.  It's designed that way.  The developers can't just implement something because they want to - they need support from enough users or miners, *regardless of the technical merits*.
It is not a system that rewards the *best solution*.  It is not a system that allows a small group to guide or control the network.  It is an antifragile system that requires broad consensus for major changes.  The motives of these stakeholders may be technical or economic or something entirely different.  That's how it was designed.

Removing the freedom and pseudo-anonymity of the system, i.e., caving to the desires of overreaching regulators, is not the solution to fear of overreaching regulators. The solution is making such regulation impossible to enforce, which bitcoin has already done, and newer cryptos may do even more effectively. 
Bitcoin is not about legal freedom. It is about actual freedom. Possession and cryptographic security of that possession. Cryptographically protected freedom to transact.

I haven't looked at the code but I am concerned about a number of issues. 
First and foremost, why is there even a website or web backend for this?  As far as I can tell, the whole thing could be easily done in the app itself and avoid making us dependent on your web service. 
Second, and relatedly, why do you keep one of the keys when we could just have one key we keep ourselves?
Next, what is the "validation phrase" shown in settings?  There's no explanation of what this is. 
Finally, what is this "master public key" you send in the verification email and why in the world are you sending it to me in an email?  The email implies that it can be used to bypass my password as well as 2fa. That means that anyone who gets into an email account of a user with this email stored somewhere can hack their account. 
Why would users even want or need such a thing?  IMHO it's an unnecessary security risk. 
So altogether, just to set this up, I have a password, 2fa, three pass phrases, and something called a "master public key" whose nature and purpose is unclear.

BS.  To deny people a right to feel affinity to their own race, nation, or culture, is to promote their dissolution.  It's essentially a slow genocide of cultures and peoples.
All the posters here simply act as though there's no effect at all when you inundate European countries with muslims.  You act as though there are no identifiable cultural or practical differences between muslim immigrants to Europe and the native peoples and cultures in Germany, France, etc.  That's just ridiculous.
There are not only passive ways in which muslims are eroding the way of life in these countries, but also active ways.  There is an aggressive and vocal minority of muslims in some of these countries that want to see the Islamic call to prayer broadcast throughout many cities, and see muslim women wearing burqas, which would completely change the character and culture nearly beyond recognition for the people who have lived there for hundreds of years.
To be merely _against_ change like that is not racist and is not bigoted.  To be against muslims for reasons of statistics, e.g., that they take a disproportionate amount of welfare money in those countries, is also not racist or bigoted because it's _true_.  
To be sure, there is a frustration with muslims for reasons such as the above that may be construed, or may turn into, dislike, disapproval, and disdain.  But there is fundamentally nothing wrong with being against a force or a group of people who are eroding your country or culture.

Saying Linux hasn't succeeded on the desktop is like saying Apple hasn't succeeded in the server market.  Who cares?
Linux is a phenomenally unbelievable success.  I don't know the stats, but a vast number of servers are running Linux for every website, web service, and startup out there.  It is the go-to OS for servers.  
If bitcoin finds a niche anything close to that, it will be a huge success as well.  Maybe bitcoin will underlie other payment systems, or maybe it will be used only for international or inter-system transfers while you use apple pay or other things for your local spending.  Who can say how the final picture will look, but it doesn't matter.  The one thing I'm certain of is that it won't be a failure a-la Be-OS.

I don't think that latency is going to be a bigger issue than electricity cost. We already have miners coalescing into areas of low cost electricity. The important thing isn't where they are as much as how unified they are. We haven't really had a problem with worrying about over-centralization of mining for years now - the market share is well-fractured among many pools. 
And I'd add that there are different places in the world with low cost electricity besides china. Iceland may be one. If solar works, the Middle East or western US could be good places. 
There will always be companies running full nodes, but the more the better. I like that Dash has explicit incentives for masternodes even though some knock it - with that system you know you'll have enough nodes. Honestly I don't know the solution to this if we end up with fewer and fewer nodes over time and it becomes an issue. Maybe people can start to divide the work of verifying the blockchain so that they can only do part of the work on their own machine and that work is shared.

I totally agree that Linux on the desktop is not what certain zealots always wanted it to be. It's not a complete failure, but it's not a success either.

Nope. Aggregating clean coins is different from aggregating clean coins with tainted or identified coins. 
The following is hypothetical since I don't do this stuff. But if I were to make some illegal crypto, I would just obfuscate it in one of many many ways, and then it's clean. No problem at all. I could even go sell it at coinbase and all they could do would be ask me the source of my funds. If they didn't like it because I'm a poor mofo, I could sell on an unregulated or foreign exchange and wire to my US bank. Source of funds is just trading options on okex or something. 
But why would I even bother when I can keep it safe in crypto and just clean what I want to spend when I spend crypto?  I can buy trips, hotels, airplane tickets, sell for cash and party, etc. can do a large amount of whatever I would ever want to without even bothering with exchanges. And if I want to, I c an use ones outside the aml regime or clean my coins first. It's really not hard.

Then you only have a 50% chance of getting into the next block if you pay the lower fee. And regardless of when you end up being confirmed, you have half the speed of confirmation as with the higher fee because half of the blocks won't take your txn.

1) I don't think this is likely to happen in the scenario we're talking about, which is large blocks + low fees.  Stores set minimum prices for their goods because otherwise they won't make money.  They don't usually close the store down just because people don't come in as much in the early afternoon.  They usually keep the store open and stick to their price minimums so as to preserve the value of their product and make a larger amount per sale.  Sure, there is a lot of pricing theory involved in this, and sometimes they will lower prices, but my point is that they will not simply sell for whatever they can get.  The current state of mining is an economic aberration because fees are basically gravy on top of the mining rewards.
2) As I said, I believe that for the most part, miners would continue mining and simply pick up the transactions paying enough for them.  Users would know the prices required by each pool.  If the prevailing price was simply too low for some, then sure, they'd have to drop out, as have many miners in high-electricity-cost areas.  
But again, the point to remember here is that users would respond to a lower probability of confirmation (due to a certain percentage of miners refusing low fee transactions) by increasing their fees.

This is an important issue for many traders there so id like to get to the bottom of it. 
It seems that you always must enter a passport number to register. No way to register without it. So you must have entered something and forgotten the number. 
I have a couple of questions. 
1. Did you possibly save the number you entered anywhere?  I'm guessing not since you don't remember ever entering one. 
2. What exactly did they ask you for?  What happened when you tried to withdraw?  Did you get an email?  Did it just fail?  Who initiated the chat?  What exactly did they ask you for in the chat?  I don't see them asking for a passport scan in the portion you quoted. Maybe they were just asking for the number?
If you can't remember what you entered, you may have to tell them that your info must have been mistyped or misentered and you need to correct it. Try to tell them that you have all the password and 2fa and everything and that the scans are the correct passport so whatever was in the system before must have been a mistake or mistyped somehow. 
Please let me know the above and keep us apprised of how it goes.

If enough people knew about bitcoin when that started happening, they would say fuck the government and use it anyway.

1. There is clear evidence that block size increases will have no negative effect on the network or propagation for increases up to 8mb. The article doesn't address this. 
2. Technology for reducing the amount of data required to propagate a block is being worked on. The whole block will not have to be propagated under these schemes. This would make it even harder to negatively impact block propagation with an increased block size.  This is not addressed in the article. 
3. Lightning or similar systems can be used even with larger block sizes. This is not addressed.
4. I believe that other alt coins use larger block sizes without seeing excessive centralization or orphan rates. This is not addressed. 
5. With respect to fees, miners will only mine blocks that make economic sense for them to mine. When the block reward gets small, miners will start to require higher fee transactions or more transactions to be profitable. That means that they will not mine unless they're able to put together profitable blocks. Although they may want to mine every transaction they can get, without a high reward they will have to set limits to what they will mine or they will cause fee erosion. If miners only mine transactions with a minimum fee, however, they can be assured of remaining profitable. 
One might think that they would all be forced to accept as many transactions as they can fit, but they won't be if they have some clout. Larger pools can set a fee floor and people will have to follow or they will not get into that pool's blocks. That will create upward pressure on fees, and other pools will follow in what would be called "conscious parallelism" in antitrust law. Essentially, they will form an informal cartel to keep fees high enough to make money.  
Pools have limited market power to the extent of their block mining frequency. In other words, when btcc is going to mine three out of the next 10 blocks, you don't want to be locked out of btcc blocks by not meeting their minimum fee. 
If transaction volume increases enough to allow a reduction in fees while remaining profitable, some pools will reduce their minimum fee and increase transactions mined in blocks. So long as there is _enough_ block space for the transactions they want,  supply and demand will balance. 
Thus, it won't matter how much extra block space there is. Fees will not be close to zero if there's a low block reward, even with large blocks. 
In contrast, if blocks aren't big enough for all legitimate transactions, the functionality of the system is constrained. People who want to use bitcoin can't, and it can't grow. There is even a a limit to what lightning can do, as some have mentioned, as channels have to be opened and closed on chain, and the space has to be available for that.

I don't think you realize that once you buy bitcoin on an exchange, you can generally withdraw it instantly whenever you want, and often the limits are very high if you're registered. It's only fiat deposits and withdrawals that take time because they go through the banking system.

The same economics don't apply to an infinitely divisible currency. There's no need to try to keep prices at the same "numbers" when actual currency supply is not an issue. In the past we actually had problems with shortages of currency, but electronically, that's no longer a concern at all.

It is a perfectly good use case. It is awesome to be able to use bitcoin directly for purchases because you don't need to pay fees to middlemen. 
With larger blocks eventually, block transmission size hacks, and other things like lightning, all working together, there is absolutely no reason we can't continue to do small transactions.

Under the current law, debts are all payable in fiat, and you can't lend in gold or other things like bitcoin and demand repayment in those other commodities. This was resolved by the Supreme Court back in the early 1900's because lenders demanding gold payments were bankrupting people due to its appreciation versus the dollar. I don't recall, but maybe it was during a silver standard period. 
Anyway, so banks can't demand payment in anything but fiat for a loan. The law would have to be changed. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:49:03
Up to the last couple paragraphs, your comment agrees with the original poster from ZH - without lending, the economy will implode. I agree. 
Then you say the banks won't lose money?  If people put their savings in crypto and the dollar inflates, banks lose their reserves and lose purchasing power. They may be making a 3% spread but in a currency rapidly losing value, and with increasingly less capital to lend out or invest. Loans will definitely dry up. Who wants to be the lender when they lose money in real terms vis-à-vis crypto?
This is the "hyperbitcoinization" scenario written about at the Nakamoto Institute blog a few years ago. 
It seems unbelievable, but considering the state of first world economies, Gresham's law, and our inability to visualize disruptive change, I think it could actually happen.

By the way, the shift card is also great for what it does differently, as it keeps your balance in btc on coinbase and *it works with ApplePay*!
Disadvantages: 1000 per day limit, and coinbase requires many more confirmations for deposits.  Also you can't use it for ACH like bitpay.

Jesse -
I can understand that your position is difficult. 
I would suggest that everyone who is a customer of your exchange or others would feel far better if you were to inform them that you have been forced by authorities or by your bank to freeze funds, rather than the usual infuriatingly cryptic notices.

It's also interesting how Jews are so overrepresented among communist leaders throughout history, overrepresented among media companies, overrepresented in the pornography industry which they created and pushed, overrepresented among leftist lawyers, overrepresented among immigration advocates, and many more areas antithetical to western civilization.

That's funny because there are quite a few other coins that have variable block sizes.

Your comment seems conclusory. Why can't crypto replace these institutions?  Why can't they be based on a deflationary currency?
Banks are based on debt, but not on inflation. They can invest in projects and businesses that build real value, and pay that as interest to their customers, regardless of inflation or deflation. The loan terms would simply have to take the inflation rates into account. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:04:53

I'm finding that a really cool feature of the bitpay card is ACH transfers. You can pay your credit card and other bills this way through the bitpay card. Just send the amount you are going to pay to the card and in one or two confirmations it's there, and you can pay bills. Waaay faster and easier than getting it into a bank account first. 
You could pay all your bills this way if you wanted to in the US, and just keep btc right up to the time you needed to pay them. It's amazing that they can process transfers that quickly. It's almost like an instant bank deposit in btc.

In terms of "money" you may be right, but I've been dismissing ethereum for too long because of its lack of a hard cap on issuance, and missed not only the massive increase in price and market cap, but also its amazing and quickly developing technology. 
Seriously, you need to go learn the tech and learn what's happening with it. Some stupid token issuances are worthless, but others are not, and it's stuff that can't be done with bitcoin.
It has issues. It's a new technology. But it's developing at a hare's pace versus the snail's pace of bitcoin. I should have started really learning how it worked over a year ago.
