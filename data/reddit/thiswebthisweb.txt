@_date: 2014-03-23 22:48:16
If so, then why not trade with your own wallet directly and avoid paying any fee to bitpay at all? Since that was also the whole point of Bitcoin. Its easy to do to. Bit pays business model depends on the fiat conversion fees. (Sorry for double post)
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:40:55
Yeh.  I'm loosing faith in Bitcoin. This is perhaps for another post, but one thing to be fair that  Bit pay  does eliminate is a 10 minute wait for large purchases.  I can't help but think there is no way a merchant is going to make everyone wait 10 minuets (and sometimes its hours) before they can buy a new TV (or even 100 pounds on a monthly food shop for example).  I wouldn't wait. And the only solution is 3rd parties insuring against loss/risk of double spend.  Then I just end up thinking what was the point in Bitcoin. Might as well stick with Visa card.

And now that snow den has exposed their tactics, many more people are using encryption as standard for comunications, and not using us proprietry software.   And that's where Bitcoin comes in for trading too!   Its game over for the US economy and spying, until they get their guns out.  Which they probably will.  
@_date: 2014-01-28 11:08:24
OP is right.  Lots of people say market forces will bring down fees. Its wrong.  If it were true, then market forces brought down credit card fees as low as Bitcoin.  The richest get the most power.  There's no anti monopoly system inherent in Bitcoin exchanges.  Mtgox has the monopoly.   And will continue long before we want Bitcoin to be adopted mainstreem.  I think we have to undercut the capitalist element through philanthropy.  Linux still fails to undercut windows.  It does a little but very small.  Can't anyone in the world create  an OS to complete with windows and iOS. Of course. But greed and capitalism prevents it from being so.  Just 2 OSs are used in the world.  (OK 4 if you if include smart phones). Market forces have done nothing to help.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:27:53
No it doesn't.  I can make a credit card transaction and you will know exactly who owns that card (its part of the transaction) but if I buy something with Bitcoin you won't.  that's why silk road doesn't use credit cards and does use Bitcoin.  And also why anyone on silk road will never have to pay the IRS (not because drugs are illegal but because the Bitcoin can't be traced) .  silk road could never happen with credit cards.  Its proof of what I have been trying to explain.  I want Bitcoin to be taxed like currency, but the best way to do that is to treat it like currency, where what is traceable is the purchases, not the coins themselves.  That is what makes money laundering hard.  Capital gains means tracing and recording the means of purchase.  The one thing Bitcoin, unlike anything on earth, is able to avoid very very well.  I don't like the IRS decision because its so unenforceable, and that means a lot of tax dodging will happen. Because even to the risk adverse it will be to easy, its almost impossible for the IRS to touch you with  very little effort.  They need to tax what you buy not what you sell, because what you sell (Bitcoin) is invisible.  Unlike real property (a house in Monaco)
@_date: 2014-02-08 12:50:13
I guess I am saying that growth in the market of these middlemen is a direct indicator of bitcoins becoming more and more risky to hold.  And the feedback loop compounds it further.  Conspiracy theorists could suggest that these companies are actually, possibly by design, going to kill Bitcoin until we just use fiat again.

Where is the added layer of security?  These comoanies don't make paying any more secure, indeed Bitcoin is the most secure transfer of funds ever to have existed. Specifically because you aren't relying on a middle man,  who are actually the weakest link, they can run of with your money.  Just as gox  did, so can bit pay and coin base etc.  But if I keep my money in my wallet (as both a merchant and buyer) there is no security issue.   Of course any site can rip you off, but that's nothing to do with Bitcoin or paypal or credit card companies or cash.  Bit pay don't solve that issue.

Yeh I don't get whats going on.  This is the biggest crash yet, even my gox collapse didn't cause this bigger drop.  And the usual websites like coin desk are almost silent on it.   All the other  news about Bitcoin is posative too.  IRS is debatable but hardly a crash starter.  So what is it?   Something much bigger must be happening.  Is happening.  The price is truly dire
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:40:37
Those companies that use that accept BTC, probably use bit pay or bit instant .  which means they have converted back to dollars the moment you spent your BTC.   So what is the point in using BTC if they really want the dollars.  i hope you get my point now?  I just struggle to see how bit coiner enthusiasts can accommodate these companies so well.  They are treacherous to Bitcoins biggest advantage which is not having to use fiat and third parties.  But nearly all.merchants do exactly that when they accept Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:13:55

@_date: 2014-03-24 08:27:04
Most if not all the open source free wallets have real time conversion to fiat  exchange values.  BitPay isn't needed for this unless you immediately need it to be converted to fiat.  Ergo my entire point.  I know bit pay is convenient. But only if you don't want Bitcoin.  So where is its value to Bitcoin long term. ? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:06:25
why do we need it? Should we just trust unconfirmed transactions?   Suppose it falls over, suppose mycelium servers  break.  If people have started to rely on it (and they will, it is a neat idea) then that becomes a problem for Bitcoin , like mtgox.  I just think such ideas need to be built into Bitcoin protocol itself.  Any system that depends on a third party is a system that says Bitcoin doesn't work properly.
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:35:19
Yes, this is true.  But I am saying (not trying to be a dick) that if that happens then Bitcoin is no longer viable.  People don't want Bitcoin transactions to be changeable.  If they did they would just use what we have.  Fiat banks!

My point here is that a deposit slip is a record with your signature that the govnt and or a court can see.  A password isn't.  But more importantly nobody would even know you had such a password , never mind prove what it is.

@_date: 2014-02-16 10:53:06
What I should really say is that any encryption (even the best in the world) doesn't count for anything if the password is weak.  The PDF which contain 1 or more 34 digit alpha-numeric passwords (the bitcoin private key) is protected by a weak alphabetic (caps only) 16 digit password.  This document is then also sent around the world by email, unencrypted.   It reduces, massively Bitcoin keys built in high security.

Even 60 seconds is too long.  Seriously count 60 seconds after buying a pack of chewing gum at a checkoutbefore walking away.  And during that uncomfortable silence, as the cashier taps her fingers on the counter, ask yourself what if everyone used crypto too?  I love crypto, but for all its flaws the txn time issue is the biggest, and it one that cannot yet be fixed.  I am in no doubt that Bitcoin will never be used at pos counters unless you pay a third party like bit pay (which negates the decentralised benefits of Bitcoin and increases the cost )
@_date: 2014-04-04 07:13:59
Look I am talking about documentation.  Tangible documentation a lawyer bank govnt firm can read and trace.  Mostly this documentation is traceable by design too.   I trade something , say a derivative, with you and  you sign it, by name and get it witnessed by lawyer. That's all.  Bitcoin by its nature has no such thing because the key is truly private and intangible and unknowable.  The block chain proves a transaction happened but not who it happened between.  That's the crucial difference.  Bitcoin is not like a currency or property it is truly unique.  People like you and the IRS don't get that and try to classify it in the wrong hole.  But even so, if it must be categorised, its way closer to currency than property.   Many leading Bitcoin programmers agree also.

I want businesses accepting Bitcoin.  Not bit pay which is not accepting Bitcoin but pretending to accept Bitcoin without actually accepting it.  If you or your supplier want to accept Bitcoin great.  Then use your own wallet, pay now fees, and keep your Bitcoin.  If you don't want the risk, don't bother at all, as all bit pay does is waste customers purchase of Bitcoin (both time and money) by converting it back to fiat again and Bitcoin is passed back to exchange for some other sucker to purchase again for fiat, with another fee having to be paid to the exchange.

Yes that sounds right. So many Bitcoin enthusiasts are not seeing this problem. And its only going to get worse. Bit pay is on board of Bitcoin foundation. They are not really pushing Bitcoin (people just love them because its not PayPal and they talk bitcoin) but behind it all, the reality is that these middlemen are pushing dollars on the merchant stripping them of any bitcoin they are given by their customers. They are preventing consumer adoption by taking the coins out of the system and back on the exchange to sell again, a continuous loop that prevents distribution and adoption. Do you have a link to that Vinny ling ham thing. I'd appreciate it.

I understand why merchants with little interest in holding or spending bitcoin would use bit pay. I don't understand why anyone who buys or holds bitcoins would spend using bit pay.  It makes no economic sense, but it also makes no ideological sense.  Your spending your bitcoin back to fiat, not exchanging it for the product.  That's just the illusion on which bit pay thrives on.  Exploits ignorant Bitcoin users hopes, dreams and bank account.

But monopoly property behaves like property but its still not property either.  What's your point.
And monopoly money behaves like a currency also.  I know Bitcoin and monopoly money aren't currency!  They both behave like one.  Your rude also.  You pick and choose elements you want to see and elements you want to ignore.  In the end Bitcoin has more elements than all of them put together.  But you think Bitcoin IS property.  But nothing like the rest, except cash, but cash isn't like property.  You really make no sense to me I am afraid.

As long as the risk of holding Bitcoin remains bigger than the risk of holding fiat bitpay is use ful.  But if we all decide that Bitcoin is less risky and desirable than bit pay serves no purpose.  Bit pay needs Bitcoin to remain risky and less desirable than fiat.

They could force overstock or any major company to do that.  Then buyers will stop using them.  That's what happened with the NSA scandal.  IBM, redhat, Google cisco and other major us companies are loosing millions at the moment from big foreign customers switching away from us software and hardware that was collecting data.  I doubt they will make that mistake again.  US customers can go elsewhere too.   In fact many people buy from eBay sites direct from China and elsewheere.  Soon they will be able to do that with Bitcoin too.  Overstock and amazon are already struggling to compete.

Why would Bitcoin users use bit pay anyway.  Its a fiat money exchange just the same as PayPal.  It concerts Bitcoin to fiat and prevents closing the loop between merchant and Bitcoin buyer.  Bit pay do no good for Bitcoin, they sound out they do but in fact every penny of their profits depends on people not wanting to hold Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:06:05

Yes for normal exchanges.  Sorry I didn't mean coin base.   I am talking about paying for goods with Bitcoin.  Which is what companies like bitinstant does.  Why do I need bitpay or bit instant.  Why does a merchant need them, and pay a fee for them,  instead of using a wallet and controlling the payment yourself.  It defeats the whole purpose of Bitcoin!  Unless you don't want to hold Bitcoin and want to convert it to dollars automatically.   But why would you do that unless you had no faith in Bitcoin.  Either way it proves using Bitcoin is no different to using visa. Third party fees and all.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:54:59

Exactly!    But there is so much hype about these companies on sites like this and coindesk, to me they just prove Bitcoin is not working as its supposed to and startups are charging fees to merchants to use Bitcoin (to convert payments instantly back to dollars),  which makes them not only no different to visa, but worse, as they actively discourage merchants from holding Bitcoin by offering a service that replaces them instantly with dollars!

@_date: 2014-03-24 08:36:39
When you buy something using bit pay you are essentially selling those Bitcoin on an exchange and buying the goods with that sale (fiat money).  And selling Bitcoin makes the value of Bitcoin go down against the fiat you sold for.  On top of this you pay a fee to bit pay.  And if you want to spend more Bitcoin with bitpay you have to go back to exchange to get some, pay a high fee for the privilidge, only to have bit pay convert it back to the exchange again.  We need to close the loop so the merchant and buyer don't touch fiat, the fees are zero and Bitcoin keeps its value as a currency in itself.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:19:16
Honestly, I think Bitcoin status has been debated for no good reason.  Just FUD.   Its legal and will be legal forever more. Really.  That's why its value is so high.   The people starting the debate are those who are scared of it.  There's been exactly zero challenges about its legality in court.    Its legal.  Always has been.  I wish people would stop bitching that its grey.  It simply isn't true.

@_date: 2014-06-20 12:16:07
Yes agree this is an issue that needs thinking more about in practice, the theory is sound if there is a viable payment processor.  But mostly i am excited about it as its a way to trade between different cryptocurrencies without a payment processor or fee.  Allowing this makes the total value of all cryotocurrencies more fluid and therefore encourages spread and adoption without always needing fiat.   Crypto as a utility of exchange becomes more relevant if all coins are  interchangable.
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:36:44
I prsume silkroad manages to accept Bitcoin just fine without coin base or bit pay.  So why can't other legal merchants do the same.  That was the whole point of Bitcoin.  It annoys me that merchants are using bitpay instead of their own free wallet and annoys me even more when they say they are accepting Bitcoin, in fact they specifically aren't if they use bit pay, that's the whole point to convert it back to fiat the moment it is spent.  Which makes it pointless for the buyer to have bought Bitcoin in the first place (for which he will have paid high exchange fees to do as well).

Wrong. You can make Bitcoin anonymous by coin joining, tumbling, mixing etc. Sure no computer secirity feature system is 100% guaranteed but its a far cry from giving all your personal details to a third party. Or in this case making it non anonymous by design.  I want it at least as anonymous as cash.  But its 3rd parties in general that bother me.  If you think we need 3rd parties to spend Bitcoin then you have no idea what Bitcoin is for.

Is this why Bitcoin has been plummeting today?  Because of this apple story :(
Its sad, but I don't see it matters much to Bitcoin from a practical point.  Web apps like kryptokit seem like the best way forward for all wallets because they can integrate with actual websites that you are buying stuff from.  coin punk too.  Html5 make Bitcoin wallets more flexible and os independent.    Eg theres no WordPress app to view or interact with WordPress web site.  Wallet just arent that complicated, visually they don't need a complex front end ui which makes them well suited to html5 browser.  Eg. Like a WordPress site.  There's no need to make a website app for every WordPress blog unless they are really complex.  Like say an eBay app which works better than the website in many ways.

Ah but you should worry how it runs its affairs.  The charges to the merchant are paid for by your purchases it effects you, maybe that's worth the benefit to you, but it depends what their fee is to the merchant, and they have total control of that. It will be passed on to you.   And if the charges on your bill don't match, its your word against theirs. I suspect they have  much bigger lawyers.  They could reposess you if you cant pay of the card (loose your job for example) too. With Bitcoin the proof is in the block chain.  Transactions are instant and final. There's no future risk or unexpected fees and charges  ( mostly via the cost of the goods you buy with amex)

Also its all very well saying its fine for a coffee but not large purchases.  That still leaves a lot of stores at risk or customers waiting for a long time.  If I buy my weekly food shop, a new phone, computer.  There are a lot of things to buy other than a coffee.  That example is getting tedious.  Of course its fine for coffee but what about everything over say £100 .  do people not spend this much in one go.  I spend this on a weekly food shop at the supermarket.  Is that now out of the question,  without a middle company offering paid escrow?   Sounds like Bitcoin will go nowhere if so.  Every time I am forced to use escrow or middleman to spend or buy bitcoin I think what is the point in Bitcoin.  That's all banks do.

The risk of litigation from torrent apps is too great.  That's just FUD again.  Torrent apps have been around for over a decade and nobody has litigation issues.   To do so would mean the internet is illegal.   The app store is no different to a search engine.  Is Google worried? No. And torrent apps have legitimate uses.  Computers like apples can be used to look at child porn, indeed its likely they have been, this is deinnitely illegal.  Are they going to ban web browsers no.  So you see its all FUD again.

You are wrong.  Bit pay doesn't encourage merchants to adopt Bitcoin. Bit pay merchants never touch any Bitcoin ever.  That's the whole point.  BitPay allows merchants to 'accept' Bitcoin without actually using,  holding, trading, spending or selling a single Bitcoin.    All BitPay does is give an oportunity to give the appearance of taking Bitcoin for merchants who don't actually want to take real Bitcoin, because they don't like Bitcoin, they want fiat.  BitPay and the merchant trades in fiat.  The consumer is the only one using Bitcoin.  He then has to buy it back at a higher price if he wants to use that same merchant again.

Sure, If you want escrow.  But then why not just use a credit card - for all their flaws as an escrow service they are very very good..  They allow charge backs to merchant, insurance against faulty goods etc.  Escrow relies on third party looking after the money.  Bitcoin is supposed to be about not having third parties.  If you do want one, like an escrow, then what is the point in buying Bitcoin (with high exchange fees) and using that when you can use a credit card.  Its neither cheaper or ideologically advantageous to the consumer.  It possibly makes the merchant look cool (Bitcoin as a fashion) but that's by the by.

Humble pie.  Many apologies, I finally understood what I was not getting before. A user just explained on here.  It takes a long time to decrypt a PDF to open it.  I assumed it was instant.

Why is a closed system an excuse to abuse their monopolistic power?

No they did none of these.  MP3 players were around long before apple made one.   So were smart phones.  Microsoft and Sony and symbian  revolutionised smartphones and touch screens.   And they made a lot of money from sales too.   Apple overtook them with marketing and style.    But they didn't revolutionise the industry.  They were always other players around before during and since.    Since android sales have overtaken apple you could just as well say Google revolutionised smart phones and tablets.

You've completely miss understood.   I am not talking about fiat exchanges.  I am talking about merchants that take Bitcoin using bit pay.  If you take Bitcoin in Bitcoin its because you want Bitcoin.   If you want fiat take fiat.  Exchanges like mtgox etc are different.  Not merchant related.

Why multiple seconds for each try? I can manually type random numbers in in a few seconds. I agree it wouldn't be that easy but not that impossible either. What is the point in having such strong Bitcoin encruotion, with massive, long private Bitcoin keys (much much harder, impossible brute force) if you wrap those in a document with much much weaker encryption. Guessing a Bitcoin private key is extremely difficult. Guessing a 16 digit alpha caps letters only key is intimately easier. What's worse is that sending that PDF is also not encrypted over email and easy for hacker to get hold off. 
 Edit: should say 16 digit not 10 sorry.

Right.  So bit pay, coin base, bit instant and the like all make money from Bitcoin skeptics.  Ones who don't want to hold Bitcoin but want to trade in it for PR or whatever (but change imediately back to fiat for which they charge their fee and make their profit) So these so called 'Bitcoin companies', only have one interest - to ensure Bitcoin remains volatile and that merchants dont want to hold it.  If Bitcoin worked and merchants wanted to hold Bitcoin, there would be no need to pay these middlemen.  I just think its worth reading between the lines and not get excited by investors in these types of Bitcoin companies or any merchant that uses them for that matter.  The more popular and successful they and their merchant clients are the greater the lack of confidence in bitcoin and thus the more volatile the future and a greater reason for the wider public to ditch their coins.

No.  The public ledger holds information about Bitcoin not the people who own it, who have to pay the IRS in fiat currency.  You must be trolling now.  I know you understand that.    And if it was true what you say then silk road wouldn't exist would it, because everyone who uses it would be filling out a tax form with their name and address.  If you can tell me who owns the all the stolen mtgox  Bitcoin , which apparently you claim is what the block chain is for, then please go ahead, lots of people would love to know. Oh and Bitcoin is international.  A crucial difference. So the IRS can't be snooping on my or other foreiners personal data either, that would be illegal under EU law.  Not that they could get hold of it anyway as no names or owners adress are recorded in The block chain (you all see, go on have a look).

I'll check out share to SD.  But I fail to see how a 16 digit caps only alphabet key is as secure as the 34 digit alphanumeric Bitcoin key.   The PDF is the weakest link.  And as difficult as it is to brute force, its surely making Bitcoin 34 digit security ultimately worthless.   And the lack of pin number by default is not a false claim.  I find it hard to believe you (or anyone else with a vague understanding of security) really don't see this as a security issue.

No he doesn't. The computer reads the key.  The miner (human) never sees can or has access to it.  The bank and bit pay are third parties that do have access to your money or your Bitcoin (which is why mtgox was able to steal/loose them but miners never could)

I do agree with your use of the phrase 'conceptually speaking'.  But that my point its conceptually the same but it can't be legislated against the same because no paper or document or account exists for the user of a brain wallet.  So the concept only works for the merchant seller, not for the govnt or law, because concepts have to be tangible before you can prove someone's trading one.   I genuinely think you miss understand my point.  I want Bitcoin to be regulated as currency.  And taxed.  Not as property.

What Bitcoin accomplishes is the tools old fasioned cash provide.  But it isn't just cash.  Its way more complex than that.  That's oversimplification to understand its purpose not its technological design and implimentation.  It is the design and implementation that the IRS needs to understand.  Not just what it looks like on the surfa  Just as you can't say mp3 is like a record (they both sound the same and serve the same goal of being able to hear recorded music) and pretend that access manufacture, sales and distribution must also be the same.  It took them decades to realise this too and tried to implement DRM etc.  It failed because they couldn't see the whole world had changed with digital media. The same is true of digital 'e-cash'.  Bitcoin won't be taxed like property for ever, because its stupid.  You will see this one day.  It requires new rules for a new idea.

That's right, because I couldn't find an easy way to contact developers without registering with github and adding as bug.  It annoys me when devs don't leave email address on play.  There's no email in app either.  Sometimes they respond to play comments.  Don't get me wrong I like the app but I cannot understand how people haven't pointed this out before.  Yes every smug and wise Bitcoin enthusiast uses a cold wallet.  But many more newbies don't.  Not everyone is a knowledgeable security enthusiast, they just want to use Bitcoin.

As I say it makes sense for exchanges, people buying Bitcoin somehow, but what for the payment companies.  People who HAVE Bitcoin and want to spend Bitcoin.  Why do we need bit pay and bit instant?  The whole point is we should be able to spend bitcoin directly.   The merchant may want to exchange back to dollars instantly which is what bit pay does, ( but thats because they fear Bitcoin volatility).  5 years from now, if we expect Bitcoin to be popular and volatility to stop, what is bit pays role?   They only survive by merchants fearing Bitcoin.

The more fiat the merchant takes over Bitcoin, the more profit bit pay makes.  It has no incentive to make Bitcoin useable on its own.  Supremely confident? Yes.  Blissfully ignorant? Not me.

I've a question that's bugging me.  And maybe this is what's effecting price.  Realisation slowly hitting home.  Much of the Bitcoin news (coin desk etc) is about what Bitcoin businesses are doing.  But I don't get why we should be excited.  Exchanhrs aside, companies like bitpay, bitinstant etc are actually trying to turn Bitcoin into something it was designed to replace!   Services like PayPal.  If Bitcoin is to be successful, it must be useful and replace payment companies and third party fees.  In order for this to happen then these companies must fail.   If I can't pay my merchant without the need for these third parties (and the merchant needing to pay them too) the what the hell is the point of Bitcoin.   if bitcoin businesses want to make money they have to charge fees to merchants.  If exchanges want to make money the same applies.   So every time I hear about some new Bitcoin  enterprise startup as good news on coindesk I think wither they have missed the point and their corporate greed deserves them to have their fingers burned or I think Bitcoin has failed to achieve what it claims if they are a success.  Either way it makes me feel a bit reluctant to hold on to my coins anymore.  I realise some merchants need to convert to cash quick to avoid risk, but that is assumed to be a temporary solution during Bitcoin volatility stage.  But if these companies are to continue to invest in these payment systems then surely they are betting on permanent volatility otherwise they will no longer be needed?   What have I missed?

Did you know with the mobile smartphone you already own you can buy and sell Bitcoin?

The only reason I want Bitcoin is so I don't have to rely on a third party to look after my money. Why would anyone trust the banks? Certainly not here in the UK. If I did there would be no need for Bitcoin. It doesn't cost me a penny to use my debit card. (Sorry miss posted this first time)

No ios is like windows.  Its not Bitcoin. You are confused. No one is stupid.  Ill explain. Firstly, wrong is subjective.   Eg Its legal to rape your wife in Afghanistan.  Its wrong in my opinion.  Its right in law. I disagree with the law.  We are discussing the merits and morality of apples decision.  Not what they CAN do.  We know the answer to that.  Of course they CAN remove  Bitcoin apps.  They have.  Now lets get back to the topic.  Why should that be allowed?
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:11:58
Yes it is!  BitPay does not want Bitcoin to be used directly.  It doesn't want people to use their own wallets and take their own risk that Bitcoin is a trustworthy currency.  BitPay, in order to make profit, specifically requires we never trust Bitcoin over fiat and never use our own wallets to exchange currency, and never ever let us believe fiat isnt 'better' (and therefore worth the fee to secure your coins in fiat, which is all and only where their profit is made).   Sure they may not 'corrupt' the code in Bitcoin (to use my poor NSA analogy)  but they can corrupt its promotion and understanding, which is what  the foundation is also involved with.

Well they haven't been defined as property the whole time.  Since you can't even own Bitcoin,  even digitally that remains on the block chain.  All you can own is a private key.

OK I agree its not competition of payment apps technology..  But they do have an intrerst in the dollar.  They withdraw it to make a statement that makes bitcoin appear murky.  They cant get rid of paypal, but thats not imoortant. They do need to get rid of Bitcoin.   Not because they have their own wallet.  But because they have a vested interest in dollars.  One of the biggest in the world.  Even more than the us govnt. Remember apple owns more dollars than the us govnt.

And your sure countless lives haven't been ruined by letting them off the hook? Business as usual for them.  The fine was pitiful.  And rule changes are toothless.  The same happened here in UK with Barclay's libor rate fixing.  Besides a recession is inevitable, it will happen and it will be worse than any before, even than Argentina's 2001 crash.   This move with HSBC mearly prolongs it and gives them time to prepare for their own and maintain some power.  The bailouts they received from taxpayer are being sold back to us as loans for their profits.  How can that possibly work?
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:48:12
They won't mandate it.  The us govnt doesn't dictate what Bitcoin can and can't do.  Its an international currency.  And lots of Bitcoin users don't use coin base  or exchanges but private wallets.  They can't force them to use a private exchange.  You are talking nonsense.  You still havent explain why you want Bitcoin.  You have no need for it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:05:54
And you pay for that in interest rates.   Swings and roundabouts my friend. Only difference is that the bank always gets the final say.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:57:13
Exactly. Even if we say its fine for small purchases,  in the end, large transactions require customer waits 10 minutes.  Unfortunately many people make large transactions in many shops.  That means the only way to purchase something over say £100 or even £50 (what even is the cutoff for a big store?) will require an escrow/insurance/middleman fee to cover fraud losses.  Bitcoin looses its independence and purpose, and we  might as well just use a credit card.    The 10 minute transaction is fine for online purchases (but to be honest even that is a bit of an inconvenience - I've used it with bit pay, it seems silly to wait for that timer before I can walk away from my computer), but for in store it spells the end of bitcoin as  a currency.  Bitcoin will never succeed for this purpose.  As a store if value it is still fine but for everyday spending it will never work.  Even lite coin suffered from the same issue.  Even waiting 2 minutes leaves a long uncomfortable silence at the checkout.  Its seems prehistoric than using cash or cards. Any solutions require middle men banksters and insurers.  And that's something Bitcoin was supposed to solve.  This issue can't even be fixed in an update, although an alt currency could.  I'll be waiting for this.

So they are the moral arbiter of what is good for people to use and what isn't.  What we should use our phones for and what we shouldn't?  Would it be OK if their browser blocked you from seeing websites they didn't like as well?   Google. Perhaps. What's the matter with you people. Seriously!?  You think they are entitled to do what they like because they have a 'great' product.  Apple is a  trojan horse.    Only you've seen the secret door and are still letting them through the gate.  No wonder they hate Bitcoin.   It blows the legs of the horse.

I am not a us citizen.  They wont be telling me what foreign exchange or us corporate wallet I must use. Even if they tried plenty of other countries would be happy to ignore them.  They can't even close down silk road, which is already as illegal as it can get!  and when they attempted it once, a game of wak-a-mole began.  The reason Bitcoin is used to trade illegal goods is precicely because of all the reasons I have explained to you and all the things you and the IRS and the us govnt are ignorant or in denial about.  The same is still true about outdated copyright law.  Illegal Digital piracy now accounts for around 40 percent of all digital downloads.  Its on the rise.  The law is so heavily ignored even you could probably agree its next to useless.   New technologies need new laws.  The old guard needs changing.  If it doesn't it will be ignored.  They already are being ignored, to the point that its now widly and culturally acceptable to ignore the us gonvts laws on digital data, in america itself.  Sad isn't it.  I want bitcoiners to pay their tax.  They won't if they use old laws that don't fit and can't be enforced.

This isn't why though.  And you know it.  Do you think they are loosing sales of iphones because people think they are helping drug dealers with Bitcoin?  Most people don't even know Bitcoin apps exist. But even discounting that, given that their only competitor has dozens more apps and not loosing sales we can be sure it has nothing to do with reputation.  Its about monopoly.  They want a percentage of in app purchases and bitcoin allows apps to bypass that altogether.   What would ruin their reputation is banning Bitcoin in app  purchases because it would be cheaper for their customers.  Its plain as day why they have done it.  They are making a big mistake.  And they will have to u turn eventually when Bitcoin takes off and they don't allow it.  There is no justification for banning it even if it does have a bad reputation.  You can't ban peoples opinions.  Angry birds has a bad reputation for NSA spying.  Shouldn't they be banning that?  In fact every app on the market place has some down votes or 1 star votes.   Some more than others. So shoukd they ban those too? To save their reputation.   Opinions are not damaging to reputations just because some disagree.  And I don't think the vast majority of iPhone users see Bitcoin as evil. Because most don't know what Bitcoin is.

OK.  Now let's put the question like this.  1)  How does bitpay make money?  And 2) what is bit pay afraid of that would kill it?   
Answer:  1) merchants not trusting Bitcoin clients, and Bitcoin fanboys paying over the odds to use Bitcoin in their stores. And those fanboys believing bitpay is Bitcoin. 
2) Bitcoin being trusted, people (merchants and consumers)  using it with their own wallets. Fanboys understanding bitpay isn't needed, and isn't helping Bitcoin.

Great so interest rates will have to go up on the rest of amex users to pay for it.   That 500 doesn't come for free.  Somebody pays.

I do understand this.  But volitility and speculation will continue to exist if merchamts keep using bit pay and don't hold bitcoin themselves.  So we will be stuck in a vicious circle and bitcoin will always be useless  (worse than useless actually, because for the buyer, exchange fees to convert fiat to Bitcoin are higher than credit cards)  until merchant breaks free from the bit pay middleman and closes the loop between merchant and buyer.
