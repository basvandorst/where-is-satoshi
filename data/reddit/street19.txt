So the world revolves around you , huh?

Report your capital gains. You dont want those problems...

Yes, but Litecoin is still very slow in comparison to other rising coins.
XRB, Ripple, Iota to name a few popular ones. XRB is also fee-less. Ripple and Iota are very low fee.

I sat down &amp; looked at my checking account - Then I asked myself how much someone could steal from me without getting too upset about it. That's how much Ill invest this week. Transfer the funds into a Gdax account and dollar cost average your purchases (buy a little each day) That way you avoid coinbase fees.

Ahhh you know what - you're right. You have to wire the funds in, or use a bank deposit. Coinbase allows instant transfer via debit card which is honestly - freaking amazing. Thats the only thing keeping me there. Id rather not wait 4 days to have funds clear from my bank transfer before I can move coins off the exchange.

Yep. Start with a small amount (like $20) just to get a feel for how the transactions work. Do some research on alternative crypto coins available and the tech advantages/disadvantages that they have. There are much "better" coins out there in terms of technology and ROI possibilities, but Bitcoin is winning the popularity contest and has the most liquidity - meaning it is still a good investment. This stuff is really fun, and getting into it now will only be beneficial for you. Just don't invest your rent money in it. Be prepared to loose sometimes. It comes with the territory.

And so begins the transfer of value from banks to crypto. Banks hate us.
You'll probably have to cash out via atm or money order and then transfer to another institution.

wait... really? hmm
Looking at their site - It looks like you can only trade BTC and ETH correct?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:35:23
The problem is that there isnt any other exchange that lets you buy crypto with USD as easily. If we all had 10 BTC lying around then yeah - fuck coinbase just because. But - there isnt any alternative... :(

Why do these green pieces of paper in my wallet have value?
Because the big guys in the house on the hill tell me it does.
Why does gold have value? It has a limited supply and its shiny (lol)
Value is a human concept. Things have value simply because humans believe it does.
That said - Ive liquidated my bitcoin holdings a while back. Moved onto smaller coins with better tech that can actually provide real world solutions.
Back in 2011, Bitcoin had value because we were able to transfer large amounts of money anonymously. It still has that same human defined value - but now with more hype surrounding it lol

Holy shit LMFAO
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:53:20
Unfortunately I partly agree with this. Even though - yeah - its FUD.
Bitcoin was just the beginning. There are some really exciting alt coins coming out from the woodwork that have the potential to make banking much faster, cheaper, and less stressful. While I agree with the concept that the bitcoin train has pretty much left the station for new investors - it did start the movement. Those that do their research and find the coins of the future will be doing well a few years from now.

I believe most people are still looking for an exchange that allows trading USD to crypto. Coinbase AFAIK is the only one that actually has that functionality.

When you do your taxes with turbo tax or with your tax guy just make sure to report your investment returns. Tax season is coming up so you'll have to do it this time around if you've sold &amp; made money anytime this year.

Correct. Fiat literally has no intrinsic value from the perspective of the universe other than the atoms (or whatever you believe it is) that makes it up.
Nothing has intrinsic value. It's all just stuff. Not to sound like someone that just came down from LSD, but really -
"Value" is a human construct. So if a large amount of humans suddenly claim that an item "has" value, then so be it. Sometimes enough people cling to it that it gains enough popularity to become a deep seeded belief. Ask any random person on the street - "Does a $20 bill have value?" - the answer will always be yes... People trust it to work. They know if they go down the street to the 7/11 they can use their green pieces of paper with numbers on it to purchase goods needed for their survival. Why couldn't cryptocurrency take the place of the green pieces of paper?
Personally, I believe if you can make the actual user experience of crypto transactions magnitudes easier than fiat transactions, you will see mass adoption. In that case, the "value" is in the convenience, security, and cost savings (fees) over fiat.

finally some common sense in here...
