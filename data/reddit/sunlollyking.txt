Woah! I wouldn't kill yourself! 
What security did you have enabled on electrum?

I totally agree that raising block size over and over does not solve scaling, and am very hopeful about LN.
That said it would work to clear out the mempool in the short term and at least make the currency usable (hopefully) until LN is delivered. 
Isn't BCash currently processing more transactions now per day than bitcoin? 
The fees are low because there is little congestion between transactions and so people do not compete to bid with higher transfer fees.

If we can alter the block side without a HF then surely we kind of know what would happen.
1) It would be safe considered we've seen it work with BCH
2) There'd be lower transaction fees (admittedly in the SR until the block size fills up again) 
But it's number 2 that allows the community to grow, and stave off frustration. If lightning is really around the corner we may not need another block size increase but up until that happens, we've got to alleviate the problems of today 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:19:04
But we've seen BCH with its weak development team push out the block size increase in a matter of weeks. 
All the bugs they've encountered haven't seem to has anything to do with the increase, in effect it was a large success, fees are lower and it's gobbling up market share faster than this sub wants to admit.

Yeah that's ethereum many different cryptos have different algorithms to solve for a mining reward. Bitcoins is suited to asic hardware that outcompetes all gpus.
You may make something, just probably more cost effective to mine something different

Kind of sad to see how much many coins were in Silk Road shown through the near 10% fall in prices. It does nothing to help this community.

Ah wish i'd gone with that website looks alot better. Tbh i just want my money back from BetCoinSports now. I've put in a withdrawal request but i don't even know if my deposit was ever recieved.
Every time i log into the sports book portal it says my username and password is incorrect, and they don't have a forgot your password section.

I sold 1BTC for £535 and tried to withdraw immediately in the form of an International Wire Transfer to my UK based bank. This occurred on November 3rd.. i am still waiting for the money to appear in my bank account.
I wouldn't mind the delays if they were consistent across the board for everyone and they could give a more precise time of when the transaction would be completed. 
Many people have invested in the hope of some quick christmas cash which, due to these delays has left many people unable to receive the quick cash + their initial investment they thought would only take a couple of weeks max.

Gpu mining questions are probably worth asking at a more generic sub about crypto.
Bitcoin is basically off limits for gpu mining and needs specialised asic rigs

Running in my bitcoin.conf txindex=1
Are you saying disable it ?
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:38:59
Was wanting it to both run in the background but get a log of the process starting up, downloading blocks and getting up to speed if that makes sense 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:12:21
Ah okay so now its looking like the node automatically shut down ?
I haven't issued a command to shut it down so presumably it's shut itself down because of an error?
Thanks for the help so far :)
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:36:31
Ah so i need to do the bitcoin user thing. I thought i could run it as my own user given i'm sudo.
Also when i run 
sudo systemctl enable bitcoind
i get:
Failed to enable unit: File bitcoind.service: No such file or directory
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:32:42

You're ruddy right!
    bitcoind: /usr/local/bin/bitcoind
Any tips on how i should structure my bitcoind.service file ?
Replaced that line in the ExecStart param and i think it's worked. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:21:24
Done and i still get: 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:31:47
Error: Specified data directory "/var/lib/bitcoind" does not exist.
Thanks for all the help !
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:14:25
Doesn't work as either user here is my now modified script. Can you see anything immediately wrong with it ?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:27:41
I just used same config. Is there anything else I should know 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:52:01
So i managed to get your command to run pointing it at my .bitcoin folder
bitcoind -daemon -pid=/var/lib/bitcoind/bitcoind.pid -conf=/etc/user/bitcoin.conf -datadir=/home/user/.bitcoin/ -disablewallet
And have changed the config in the bitcoind.service file but still get the same error
I already have bitcoind built from source so i don't want to repopulate another data dir with the blockchain ideally if i already have one
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:27:47
I get that when i run systemctl start bitcoind
I've ran you're command below also to create the bitcoin user and group
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:34:38
Hm i don't have a bitcoin folder in etc ?
Should i create one ?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:22:45
Any ideas?
All I do is startup bitcoind as a daemon everything else is just config as default 
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:57:58
So I do compile from source, After updating ubuntu I pulled down the latest code from master.
Sudo make
Sudo make install
Still same error....
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:44:11

If all of this works and is pointing to my correct directories from when i usually run bitcoind:
bitcoind -daemon -pid=/home/chris/.bitcoin/bitcoind.pid -conf=/home/chris/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf -datadir=/home/chris/.bitcoin/ -disablewallet
And i've edited the script to point to those directories. Could it be a permissions issue ?
