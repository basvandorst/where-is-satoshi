Of course I do. At this moment it is the only investment I really believe in. Put everything else on hold on bought btc. I'm offering "support" for all my friends on how to buy btc/how to store btc etc.
HODL HODL HODL
Do not fall for the bch shit.
I trust in alts too (was a time when i had LTC and ETH too) but BTC is the money making machine, always was and always will be.

It is dropping that is true but based on my documentation so far, it is normal. Also, it is December...money is flowing like crazy in December usually and I think it will even get "worse" in 2-3 days from now. I am no going to sell anything, looking to do it when I can buy a house, probably around 2020 or so. :)

look at the charts, all the cryptos are dropping, while i am typing, only 2 out of the first 100 are green...it's not only btc.
relax, it's Christmas, people are cashing out to buy stuff, i see it as a perfectly normal state

Christmas is over...

I'm only 30 something but had my own business, several jobs and other money making activities by this age. What is clear so far is that there is a risk in everything that you do, nothing is guaranteed from the start. Do your homework, plunge in and try to stay on top.
So far, btc has brought the biggest return in the shortest time. Is this going to last? I have no fckin idea but I can tell you one thing - i am going to HODL for as long as I fckin can.
I have friends who are on their way to become bitcoin/crypto millionaires in a few months, based on their initial investment and if all stays on track.
Did a lot of reading the past month, both good and bad and tried to filter - the only thing that makes sense if you are not day trading is that you MUST HODL and HODL and HODL and when you think it's over just fckin HODL.
 Have a look at the overall charts and RELAX, it's almost f Christmas. Spend some good time with your family and friends, dance on the bar and shit but remember to HODL for your phone if your wallet is on it! Talk to you early next year!

I believe it's also due to the timing of Christmas this year...right after weekend so banks closed for at least 4 days in a row

It has to be in a certain measure but it can't be the only reason.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:13:22
HODL and then FUCK
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:12:33
people are in a hurry to sell due to Christmas...banks will be closed etc so they want to cash out urgently...it's not just bitcoin, everything is down at the moment
