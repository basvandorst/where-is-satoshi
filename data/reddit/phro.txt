You win this game when states have no revenue, because they can't take bitcoins at will. People have to voluntarily hand them over. You can't even kill someone and get them over their dead body.
You can lock me in jail indefinitely, but who is paying to keep the place closed if no one is paying them bitcoins?
I don't think the state is obsolete, but there is a new serious check on power coming into play. Opt in states with good value proposition for citizenship seem more likely to me. Totalitarian regimes don't stand a chance in a world where money can't be looted and it can flee like cockroaches.

They're not innocent if they're profiting from illegal activity. Ignorance of the law or ignorance of breaking it isn't a defense afforded to regular people. 
As it stands right now it is too easy to obfuscate who is responsible. If you make everyone responsible then they'll start pointing fingers. If no one does time or pays a real penalty then they'll just continue even more brazenly. You need to make it really really bad for businesses to commit crimes. Being too big to identify the offending party is not an excuse.

Bitcoin doesn't have to do anything. It's not even the inevitable crypto currency. However, one could argue that it is very nearly already an alternative to state issued currencies and it appears to be the front runner of all alt currencies. It already has utility, or naysayers like you would have been right and it would have fizzled out years ago during it's infancy.
QE will continue. Struggles to maintain the petrodollar hegemony will continue. No currency is safe from collapse.

People are suckers. Your argument is not bitcoin specific. Enron, Worldcom, Fannie Mae, etc. If you claim that BTC is bad because of the propensity for scams then you must really hate the dollar.
Also, in your recent posts you make the argument that it is perfectly traceable and therefore your employer would know your every purchase. You can't flip flop your criticisms as they see fit unless you're just a troll. Based on your tenacity, hypocrisy, and cognitive dissonance surrounding your posts you're definitely not worth a continued argument. 
However, you are free to use any of the other currencies that are inflated as needed to make up for the mismanagement of your preferred state. You are being scammed by the fed every day you hold a dollar, but don't let that stop your little crusade.

There will always be an ultimate authority on who can use force and in what circumstances is it allowed. In our lifetime this has been mostly nation states, but in the past these authorities were much less consolidated. 
Literally, everything else they do is to ensure their monopoly while keeping their constituents happy enough that people want them to stay in power. All democracies and all dictatorships must have dominion over use of violence or someone else will take their power with force.
This is how it has been since the beginning with tribes, towns, nation states, corporations, colonies, etc. They're all monopolies on violence in a given area. Borders are the boundaries where they've agreed on peace.

You started by making the argument that bitcoin is bad, because it is conducive to scammers. However, you are utterly incapable of applying the same argument to other currencies.

Incorrect. The proles have no understanding of the fed, what it does, or who it benefits. 
Perhaps you could espouse some of the positives of the fed? 
To me I see our money worth less every day due to inflation/QE. Money is worth 93% less since the fed's inception which is ironic given their stated intention is to curb inflation. I see a way for my government to have an unlimited checkbook being written out of our children's future debt. The fed is a hidden and inescapable tax, and we should treat it with disdain instead of indifference.
Most people are unhappy with their government. Worldwide unrest, massive surveillance, 30% congress approval, etc. 
edit: I'm also not sure if you're fully comprehending bitcoin's impact. A successful bitcoin automatically undermines all state currencies to some extent. Whether you want it to happen or not, this will negatively impact USD if a viable stateless global currency becomes established. You think the drug market was shaken up by silk road?

It's taken a long time for the masses to get to be OK with technology like that.
What parts of Transferwire or ApplePay couldn't be implemented with bitcoin? You're just transferring a unit of value through a medium. The currency is irrelevant. The services are there for dollars, but not yet for bitcoin.

Deflation is not inherently worse than inflation. They both have pros and cons. The only difference is that our current economic structure is entirely dependent on maintaining the status quo, and therefore deflation is made out to be this economic boogie man.

Bitcoin is not contingent on moonshot values. People are spending bitcoins right now as we speak. Not many people earn in bitcoin at all yet.

People will NEVER spend their bitcoins because it's deflationary. People spending NOW don't count! lol
Bitcoin doesn't have to supplant all other currencies. It can function alongside an inflationary currency that will meet the needs for lending or whatever may be deemed necessary. If anything the prospect of rapid value increase in BTC is still as high as it will ever be, and yet people are already spending them. You can't even easily earn bitcoins yet, and people who buy them are still spending them. 
Expected deflation is very different than unexpected deflation. The biggest problem being that you can suddenly find yourself with the smallest unit of your currency being valued so highly that you can't spend it on small needed goods. If a dollar can buy you a car how can you buy a loaf of bread with a penny? You wouldn't, but with bitcoin we'd just drop another decimal place.

But it could have been done 2 years ago and alleviated the urgency we're facing now. Bandwidth in the US is up 40% annually according to speedtest and hard drive costs/gigabyte are 1/5th of the price they were when the genesis block was mined.

They also willfully disregard this rule in the context of Litecoin adopting SegWit: Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere.

Disregard that cost per gb is 1/5th of what it was at the time of genesis block and that bandwidth is up 40% annually at least in the US. Also disregard that small miners can't get paid their tiny portion of pool reward when fees exceed their split.
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:34:43
Temporarily, until new specialized hardware is designed. Either that or the fork strongly discourages any large scale mining investment from ever being made in bitcoin again.

This is only true on a homogenous network where all nodes have identical vulnerabilities. Diverse development increases the security of the network as it would require multiple different 0 days to shut it down completely. Also node count is well above 3% according to at least 2 sources.

Great rebuttal.
Anyone charged in the running of a company has a legal obligation to act in the interest of that company.
Here is another US based legal definition: 
Duty of Loyalty: As the Delaware Supreme Court explained in Guth v. Loft, 5 A.2d 503, 510 (Del. 1939): “Corporate officers and directors are not permitted to use their position of trust and confidence to further their private interests. . . . A public policy, existing through the years, and derived from a profound knowledge of human characteristics and motives, has established a rule that demands of a corporate officer or director, peremptorily and inexorably, the most scrupulous observance of his duty, not only affirmatively to protect the interests of the corporation committed to his charge, but to refrain from doing anything that would work injury to the corporation, or to deprive it of profit or advantage which his skill and ability might properly bring to it, or to enable it to make in the reasonable and lawful exercise of its power.”

Bitcoin doesn't operate in a vacuum. If fees are too high another coin without an artificial 1MB limit of premium fee transactions will discover a market price. Bitcoin will miss out on those use cases. Bitcoin will no longer be p2p cash.

I still fail to follow how signalling to entice others is "fake" signalling. What do you think their long term plan is once they have control of bitcoin? Don't they still answer to nodes validation?  Couldn't another dev team offer an alternative if they turn out to be a malicious majority?
What is their long term plan? Cash out back to fiat? Destroy their own mining investment? Devalue their own crypto holdings?
