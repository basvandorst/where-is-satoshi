@_date: 2017-03-17 18:58:55

@_date: 2017-03-02 17:20:12

You took a screenshot on Coinbase and posted it here.
@_date: 2017-02-09 11:46:49
Read everything in the community info page 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:07:55
They said they had some "difficulties" which are apparently resolved today they said I would be receiving the BTC today.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:28:58
They could freeze your account.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:01:06
Why not $3.50?
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:30:43
Anddddd back down
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:31:31
True but if you think it could be double in a few months or a year it's a good time to buy now.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:46:57
Got more on the dip! Fundip y'all!
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:20:00

@_date: 2017-01-05 18:40:04
I hear Gemini is good but I haven't tried it yet. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:01:18
Gemini doesn't have an IOS app correct? Just looking to switch to a better way of buying.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:12:16
Still working for me

As soon as Trump takes his first dump in the White House it will soar again 
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:43:17
I don't plan on selling at all really, this isn't money I need so I'm fine letting it grow. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:36:49
Also interested in this.
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:26:41
Yes, I am a janitor at Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:43:12
I would hold onto them and buy more if you are able. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:03:27
Thanks for posting 
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:15:56
I agree. Lennon was a dreamer and we all know how that went.
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:05:09
Does Uphold seem pretty good? 
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:02:45
All of the above and none of the above 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:09:07

@_date: 2016-12-31 02:28:42

Not trying to be a dick but I'm gonna need to see a picture of you being paralyzed first 
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:17:08
I can't enter my account details, any ideas?
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:17:13
Not scared at all I haven't invested more than I can afford to lose and this has happened before. Big brass balls.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:30:59
You may be right I would just like to pay off all debts with it that would be good enough for me.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:17:13

@_date: 2017-09-09 15:25:58
I was talking about a mortgage. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:08:08
Damn when I had an issue they responded pretty fast. I also was supposed to receive my BTC on a particular day but it didn't show up in my wallet until a few days later. T should still show up for you I would think.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:28:10
Yes and no 
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:40:22

@_date: 2017-05-19 14:15:16
Airbitz, Breadwallet you can buy from both of those wallets 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:39:28
Come to central Pennsylvania ain't shit going on here  
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:57:53
Breadwallet for iOS in my opinion 
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:36:35
Great video, what is his YouTube channel or name i would  like to look into more videos?
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:38:26
Scam don't do it 
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:52:39
This should be fun
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:06:53
I just want to be able to pay bills with it and if it goes high enough I would pay off some student loans and my mortgage. I'm never selling though.
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:05:16
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:24:42
Might wanna share some of your calculations wise one.
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:44:30
I think you're getting resistance because this question is only asked about 7 times each day.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:24:14
Did you find a different company that does the same thing?
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:30:46
Breadwallet or airbitz allow you to buy btc within the app
