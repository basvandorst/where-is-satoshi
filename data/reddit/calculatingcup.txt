It's for iOS 7 only so a lot of folk couldn't use it anyways.

Almost Human has mentioned them a couple of times but just in passing. Things like "found a bitcoin stick, how much is on it?"

Requires IOS 7. Oh well.

Thank you! 
I've talked with a couple of local shops near our University about accepting it with Bitpay (I frequently hear them complaining about credit card fees). I even made a list of the key points (and warnings) so I wouldn't forget anything. The hold up always seems to be their lack of ability to get online to use the site or the low volume they would expect from bitcoin. 
Care to tell me more about expresscoin?

I didn't read it either. I fail to see how tech will suddenly allow people to write fully vetted legal contracts that cover all the bases needed to ensure compliance. Maybe simple ones, sure, but things like mergers? I doubt it.

So what happens when I open the wallet on my phone and send some random amount to a friend? Does the wallet take care of the change address for me? Is there something I should be doing?

Engineer. Fuck lawyers! (But they're still kinda needed. Sort of like how spiders eat flying insects.)

So what brought you to bitcoin and how do you recommend people get started? Have you convinced any local companies to accept it? If so, how did you get around their reluctance?

Thank you.

Can someone explain why it shows two zero balance inputs and two positive value outputs? Are there still parts of that transaction that aren't mined yet or just a glitch in this visualization? 
Also, anyone else find the huge clusters interesting?

Why should I care about/use change addresses? 
Why are change addresses even a thing when you can send the exact amount you want?

Easier, if you live in an area with that has plenty of bill payment places. (unless they've added a new way). 
I will admit that it was the easiest way for me to get coins without having to use my credit card. Unfortunately I had to go to 4 shady places that were all over 35 mins away before I found one whose payment system was working and wasn't locked to a specific payer. 
I live in a large suburb next to a large metropolitan area. For some reason there are no bill payment places in my city. :-/

No worries! Thanks for the awesome list!

So if you use bitcoin to take advantage of the offer do you get four bundles? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:27:14
Thank you, kindly.

Yay Bitcoin!

Sorry for being lazy but have you seen wooden old-style pipes on any of these sites? None of our local shops sell them and I hate buying from eBay.

Bitcoin was predicted in Revelations. It's called "the mark of the beast".
