Great to see another online retailer acceping bitcoins! Feel free to list your company [on our website]( so that new users to the BTC community know where to spend their bitcoins. 
Your listing won't be available right away (we're trying to review the listings before we put them up, and we still have a big backlog of sites that need to be double checked), but once it is, you can claim it as your own.

Although I agree with the idea that simply selling them isn't great for bitcoin growth, the main thing is that bitcoin *has* to move in some format to help grow the community. What I mean by this is that bitcoin has be to used as an actual currency rather than simply being hoarded. 
Now that more small businesses are starting to accept bitcoins and larger bitcoins are actually taking a look our way, it would be a mistake to simply store them away just to keep them out of the hands of real-world financial institutions.

Great! Just put up your listing and featured it on the home page! If you want, you can register to claim your listing (we don't charge for any of the listings or claiming, so if you run into any paywall issues let me know -- it's baked into this wordpress theme so I may have to disable it).

Nice to see more brick &amp; mortars accepting bitcoins. With the introduction of bitcoin ATMs later this year (i think), I expect more real-world companies to begin accepting BTC as well.

We're trying to get up a comprehensive directory over at [Bitcoin Cheddar]( of where to spend bitcoins. Right now we have to manually review user submitted listings since we don't have any way of automating them (and neither would we want to, as that leaves the directory too open to scams and manipulation), so listings won't be up instantly, but we're doing our best to get everything up in a timely manner. 
One thing I'd like to get is community feedback on listings and their reputability -- we don't have the manpower to go through every listing and verify it for legitimacy so please contact us if there are any up there that don't match the description. 
If you guys have any site suggestions or features, please let us know and if you're a business owner, feel free to claim your listing. Any reviews would help the cream rise to the top and make it more useful for everyone. Thanks guys.

Although it's true that it's going to be difficult breaking the mindset of, "Hey, these coins are going to be worth 10% more next weekend than they do today!", we still have to give new users viable reasons to use bitcoins. The average spender probably won't be the guys who have 20-30 bitcoins, the average spender will probably be the guy with just 1-2 bitcoins or fewer who isn't looking at it as an investment and more as an interesting novelty. As we expand the list of companies that accept BTC, more people will be willing to spend bitcoins.
