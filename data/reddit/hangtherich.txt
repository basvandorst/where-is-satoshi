so if its not an exchange .. then what is it ? , its an exchange without the exchange? you can do all the functions of coinbase on bitstamp and mtgox except you cant buy and sell on the spot , if you want to have bitstamp and mt.gox serve THE EXACT SAME FUNCTION just click deposit to bank ..... and ignore the buy sell buttons until it clears  to your bank ? AGAIN WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

- its a wallet just like-&gt; bitstamp , and mtgox ...just slow as shit instead of instant,
-its a place to buy and sell like -&gt;bitstamp , and mtgox ...just slow as shit instead of instant,
-its like paypal to etrade , -&gt; well etrade serves a purpose active FAST selling and buying as well as money storage like -&gt;bitstamp , and mtgox.
 paypal serves the purpose of protecting buyers and sellers info for security -&gt; paypal is the middleman we all hate and want dead hanging from the trees

    no they are useless , use bitstamp or mt gox , its instant and no problem at all to use
