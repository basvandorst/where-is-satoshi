@_date: 2015-01-31 22:38:31
Cant that already happen with any open connection though? Also im sure if the service gave a royalty fee to the isp they would be all for it...

here's how i know it won't continue to run up till 500k: profit taking. 
Even if you whole heatedly believe in bitcoin as the future, you're still gonna get out when you start approaching numbers where your life is forever changed financially if you get out. I personally believe bitcoin will be worth 6 figures eventually, but there's no way it will do it on this current run. Too many people who's lives will change if they sell and too many weak hands who only own it because their buddy told them to buy it who will panic. It's how markets naturally work. 
Edit: Also another thing, lots people are buying bitcoin on credit right now and can't afford to watch it go down. WEAK hands. 
All that said this still could go on for longer.

i mean the volatility is a pretty damn good indicator, but also anecdotes and experience 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:52:14
what if youre an average person and put 10k in at 500 or 50k in at 1k? at what point do you start considering that your life would be changed forever if you sold out? 20k bitcoin would make the person who bought 50k at 1k a millionaire. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:39:52
Okay, and what difference does that make to what I'm saying? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:05
YES, the price is derived from the last price that is was sold at.
HOWEVER, if way more is being sold the price will be driven down because of an increase in supplied shares on the market.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND, brother

@_date: 2015-03-21 01:38:19

@_date: 2015-03-14 18:36:38
That's almost exactly what we're aiming to do! 
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:57:13
We're going to do it right and hopefully stay around. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 21:54:01

@_date: 2015-02-01 15:37:19
Im honestly asking because im not super knowledgeable on bitcoin but want to be, but why would that kill the blockchain?
