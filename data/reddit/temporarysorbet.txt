Because throwing in buzz words like "great depression" doesn't actually do anything to convince people that inequality is a bad thing. Maybe the inequality in the 1920's was fine. The great depression was not caused at all by inequality, that's nonsense. And what you wrote about inequality being a destructive force is also nonsense.
Inequality is healthy when it represents the natural inequality in people, which is massive. Some people deserve to be billionaires, others deserve to be homeless. If your economy doesn't represent that, ie everyone being equal, that's unhealthy. Which is why socialism always fails. And always will.

Yes you are. The "possible future of the currency" is reflected in the price. Bitcoin has a much better potential future if it's at $100k than if it's at $6K.
If random rocks had a good "potential future" of turning into solid gold, they'd be worth a lot of money. But there is no chance of rocks turning into gold, so they're worth nothing.
Honestly you guys in this sub have such a piss poor ability to asses the value if what you're investing in. It's embarrassing.

God this hash thing has been such a fucking embarrassment for the community.
There is literally nothing special about this hash, literally nothing at all. It didn't have more zeros than other blocks. It just had one of a million possible patterns that would have meant something to someone.

Plenty of people have "lost everything" just keeping their money in banks. It happens all the time all over the world. It's not as secure as you think.

You're an idiot. This is part of the whole "you haven't lost until you sell" nonsense.
How much fiat you can get through immediate liquidation is the most important thing. What's left without that? That you might potentially be able to sell for a higher or lower amount at some undetermined time in the future? You could say that about literal shit you find on the street. "Sure this dog shit has an immediate liquidation value of $0, but in the long term i might be a millionare".
When the value of BTC goes down, your wealth goes down. Immediately. It doesn't matter if you hold, sell, whatever. You are immediately poorer. You can try spinning that however you want to feel better though.

This isn't true. Things that exist in fixed amounts and are impossible to duplicate are inherently valuable for those reasons alone.

Nothing is resistant to optimization. Making ASICs is just one way to optimize mining, no matter what you change to eventually people will develop hardware which is optimal for that kind of mining. Whether it's computation based, or memory based, or I/O based or whatever.
Bitmain has a monopoly because since they develop the ASICs, they have the earliest access to the most efficient hardware. By the time their chips arrive in the US, they've already developed the next generation using smaller nanometer process.
But this advantage is only temporary, since there is a physical limit to how small (and thus efficient) their chips can get. Once the world is saturated with the most efficient chips and everyone has access, the bottleneck stops being efficiency and becomes about who can get access to the cheapest source of electricity, which changes the formula completely. Bitmain might quickly fall off at that point if say people in the US can access electricity cheaper than they can in China. This can turn into a geopolitical battle literally sponsored by governments.
It's good idea to just stick with SHA for now and see how all of the above plays out, since it will inevitably hit that point regardless of what mining strategy you pick out anyway. You can always easily change in the future.

Trump has repeatedly said that his ideal outcome is for all countries to drop all their tariffs against each other and have free trade. Canada, Mexico, China, and the EU all refuse. They all have long-standing massive tariffs on US imports, which is what started this in the first place.
Trump-appointed Neil Gorsuch was the deciding vote in Janus v. AFSCME that ruled that public sector unions (leftists) cannot force employees to pay dues they don't want to, which almost entirely go to funding campaigns of Democratic candidates. Public sector unions were the  largest donors to the Democratic party (leftist headquarters). (Bitcoin would have made the above a non-issue btw, since unions would never have been able to collect dues from salaries paid in Bitcoin, which is the whole point).
But don't worry, Brett Kavanaugh is also a wacky fantasy! You can stay home in November.

The largest mass killings in the last century were exclusively caused by leftists fighting for equality and social justice. Hitler's actions don't even come close to the body count of Stalin and Mao. You're not going to scrub those bodies away from your ideology.
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:30:45
Lmao. I genuinely am puzzled by what your point here is. I agree that Hitler was a leftist. The agenda of the Nazi party is pretty much a carbon copy of the modern democratic platform. Socializing education, healthcare...etc. I just don’t usually press this issue because no leftist would ever admit it. But you did for some reason.
So ok I’ll amend my statement. Leftists, including Stalin, Hitler, and Mao, are responsible for pretty much all the mass killings and genocide of the last century.
I absolutely also agree with you about Crypto being anarchy. I absolutely want anarchy, because anarchy means low (no) taxes, and no regulations. It means no single payer health care. It means no government funded schools. It means no government funded planned parenthood. It means no welfare for illegals. It means no welfare for endless hordes of Muslim/ISIS rapefugees. It means no redistribution of wealth. 
The closest I can get to this right now is supporting Rand Paul and voting for the orange Cheeto. Because he’s actually cutting taxes and regulations. If you can show me something closer to anarchy please do and I’ll vote vote for it.

My alliance isn't locked to any political party. I don't care about Republicans. I will simply vote for anything that's opposite from leftism, which has proven to be the quickest road to literal hell on earth for hundreds of millions of people.

They tried to trick people into downloading the btc1 client so that they would start spending their coins on a separate chain without noticing. Since this chain didn't have replay protection, everyone who accidentally downloaded the client thinking it was real Bitcoin lost their funds on the main chain. It was literal fraud.

Except there is no bias against blacks. They commit astronomically more crime, especially violent crime, and are much more often repeat offenders, which is why they get sentenced more often and more harshly.

The fact that black people commit astronomically more amounts of murders and violent crime in the US than anyone else is reflected in annually published FBI crime statistics. That's the source, you can go find it yourself.
I think it's something like half of all murders in the US are comitted by black males who are only ~7% of the population.
The reason for this is debatable, but hollywood promoting gangster culture sure isn't helping.

It will be some coin that manages to find another way to exchange tokens either without a distributed ledger, or without using a blockchain to securely synchronize the distributed ledger.
I don't believe that the block chain is the last, or even most optimal solution.

The rich don't have a monopoly on finance. They just produce things that are valuable, you don't. That's not going to change. In fact, income inequality will only rise with Bitcoin as leftists lose their ability to tax (rob) hard working people in the name of "equality".
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:52:03
It's only unusual to you because you don't understand the political landscape. The goals of Bitcoin and the goals of people at the\_donald overlap almost perfectly: to make it impossible for authoritarian leftists to rob hard working people of their wealth to fund their delusions of "social justice".
