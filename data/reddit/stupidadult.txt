Fair enough = ] (some items are only available via USD as you know)

This doesn't appear to be a sound investment strategy. You pay a fee when spending bitcoin and you're also at the whim of price fluctuations. I understand you don't want people to horde, but not sure this is a good idea.

I lost all my BTC stored within - someone stole them from them = ]

Never thought of it that way (such cynicism - hah)

Just saw this on cornbase: "ETH Delays We're currently experiencing delays in processing some ETH transactions. Recent or new outbound transactions may remain
            pending longer than expected."

I mean the loss from the sudden plummet today. Yeah I hear you about being "up". hehe

Good post OP. I lost through both mt gox and trade hill. The good ole days.

Now you gotta hold again for another few weeks and hopefully it'll make back the loss.

I agree - I think they have a shitty dev team. They've been around long enough that should handle and scale the usage properly. Hire someone with some experience coinbase!
