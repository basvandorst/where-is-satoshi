Freedom is innate. Every being doesn't want to be in a cage. Some ideas have lasted throughout history even during the times of slaves people have been fighting for freedom and look where we are now. No slaves anymore, well that's not true but atleast the slaves are not in shackles anymore. They wear suits and have wife and kids. So at a macro level its not bad

I meant figuratively bro. BDSM community see things differently. For them, having no cage is the cage.

This should not be flagged for removal. Trust me, this is not for Bitcoin SV community. It's a mockery. This is for BTC supporters to enjoy watching.

Not everyone who wears a suit is a slave. I'm talking about people who live from paycheck to paycheck slaving their life away to their "careers". It's not about my views. It's their views. It's them that feel like a slave. If they don't feel like one, then they're not.

Yeah right. And you are smart.
The idea existed before Satoshi or BTC. That's why there were cypherpunks. That's why Nick Szabo created Bitgold but it couldnt work. So Satoshi carried on the idea and created a blockchain to solve the double spending problem Szabo and the others couldn't figure out. Then Tom Riddle dropped mimblewimble to make bitcoin more private only to disappear immediately. In the coming years many more agents of freedom will come. And we are part of that. We who talk about the technology who support it.
