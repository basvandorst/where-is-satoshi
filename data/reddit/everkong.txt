Notice the three on top are linear charts and the larger one on bottom is logarithmic. Notice most people decide buy and sell pressure based on emotions based on linear charts. Linear charts create less visibility to previous situation that can hardly be seen as no more than a baby speed bump on the road.  Notice the first linear pic is the same as third. The major high (20&amp;20,000) and when it climbs back up to before next bull market (10&amp;10,000). So what I’m saying is the middle one suggest our next clone cycle. Hitting one million by end of next year as a major high (1,000&amp;1,000,000) and the settling point (500&amp;500k) so settling at some point between 450k and 750k (2024) just before the then next cycle for 2028-2029 hitting 20,000,000... 
Like shampoo directions..............................
Log chart curve suggest a slight slow down around or after 2030 however. Which is good cause it can’t go up forever like that. And that in mind that endless growth indicates the only direction for the world is to stop before this and just accept bitcoin as the value which would stop the growth I believe. You know what I mean basically buy a meal for 30 sats and the next time it’s still 30 sats. Otherwise governments will do away with currency all together and use a social credit system.

From the miners point of view sir.. Yes the more hash power he has the more transactions he can process and thus the more bitcoin said miner can accumulate.  You see all this is miners point of view...
@_date: 2019-12-14 14:24:03
More hash power equals more bitcoin accumulation for that particular miner. Otherwise as the difficulty grows by your logic a single first used in 2008-2009 computer would take all that it being processed but this is silly. My comment at this point remains true It is a true statement that has been shorten down to be quickly readable. More hashing equals more possible computed bitcoin transactions at a faster rate. Whether you are in a pool or not. I at this point I have no idea why I am even trying to relay the what was supposed to be a fun post to a fun community. A post about how indirectly the price actually shall rise just as the cycle will happen proved by the relation of miner to hash to greed and or need.
@_date: 2019-12-14 05:40:56
Miners point of view sir. Miner accumulates bitcoin due to processing transactions. This will remain true past the year 2140 when halvings are ended or around that time when they end. Those statements are not on creation but accumulation.
I have read and understood the programming I am a programmer I on the other hand cannot make everyone understand exactly what I mean. Those that can will!
@_date: 2019-12-14 14:36:21
I’ve also created my own crypto currency. I went to cryptocurrency schools. More than one to make sure I’m catching the best information. I’m still unsure about the best programming language but that is a different topic for debate. I care not to prove what I know. And yes it does give me a right to say. Look I understand where your are at to a degree. I will not be able to get you to understand. You seem to think you know. This post was supposed to be a fun loving post about bitcoin and how the price will raise in a cycle coupled with its relationship to the miners. Due to your last less classy post you seemed to be an anti bitcoin fan. Just because your a developer doesn’t give you a right to go across the bitcoin forum universe and insult people. Just because your read a shortened down statement and didn’t take the opportunity to read between the lines of it. You are showing your intelligence. It’s ok everyone sees you insulting others and it will catch up with you!

If you have an amount (Not on hold) equal to your purchased USDC there is a no wait situation for sending out of coinbase but one thing that is true is they have set USD up with certain pairs vs USDC on coinbase pro.. I’ve never agreed that exchanges have limited certain pairs. It should be all currencies or coins trade with all currencies or coins.
Fees may be different slightly USD VS USDC. Bank vs Blockchain....
@_date: 2019-09-15 20:11:39
It would either depend on the companies that issue their version of crypto stock or a standard set by a regulation.
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:13:06
At some point  a second layer solution (Like Lightning Network) where minimum sats below threshold you speak of are traded when those sats are worth something like in days where 1BTC is 100B. That is until the whole or most of mining network agrees to upgrade to a solution created that allows cheaper fees than what is possible. It’s upgradable so I don’t see walls. So it upgrades and no needed reason for second layer solution. But then the value goes up again bringing back the need once again for second layer solution. Over and over and over and over...

I could see that happening yep yep. Since everyone can create tokens within a coin a person could make a main coin like eth or eos or tron or so on then make the token under it be be specific houses and the number of the coin means simply a part share. At anytime a person could add their house. There would have to be some sort of proof restrictions on how to enter info due to the fact your neighbors could say they own the house because they could just inter the info... Anyways yep I can see how that would be useful...

Somewhere out there banksy is wondering why he never painted a QR code beside all the art!
@_date: 2019-09-16 07:03:28
I haven’t heard that one in a while. Thanks that’s a throw back.. Wish we could do the opposite side of lower case to whisper.... I’m not sure how that would look heh...

When will u/cryptfreedom5 be willing to spend 10 dollars a week from USD paycheck to buy 1,000 sats hoping that one day 10 sats equals 10,000 USD?
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:56:23
Is it direct or through a service?
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:15:04
Did you see that post about where that got started on bitcointalk forum in 2010? 
Found it.
It doesn’t have to be alts it could be a t-shirt but rather than buying it you just keep the bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:05:39
Revisiting this honestly I think somewhere end of 2020 to end of 2021
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:29:16
0.008mBTC = 800 sats = 0.00000800 BTC
If BTC = 100K USD
800 sats = .80 cents USD
If BTC = 100 Billion USD
800 sats  = 800k
1 sat = 1,000
@_date: 2019-09-02 05:58:39
Coinbase is USA you can transfer from bank and buy USDC for 0% fee then transfer over to coinbase pro and buy your bitcoin in a manual trade. You can send from coinbase to coinbase pro and back all day long 0% fee... You will have to wait 15 or 20 days to be able to send your bitcoin away from coinbase platforms.  You will pay some small coin network fees.

I saw a good analysis that showed the period where price moves up is slightly later each time. 
To assume why I believe it may be because each time the halving happens more bitcoin are in circulation which is a metric of supply and demand. Eventually people sell off all what they will and when that is over  that ends the supply at old price levels.
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:10:47
Oh you’ll need level 3. I have that level and my limit is $25,000 a day. Though that means you’ll have to verify your address, phone number, and upload license. Identity stuff.
Level 1 lets you do 9,500 but I think there’s limited options for storing and sending.
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:36:07
I’d say follow their steps.
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:41:48
It’s been a while but those options are in settings and under account and then under account level. Least on the iOS app.
@_date: 2019-09-16 00:30:14
Yeah that’s one of those statistics that show when internet somehow becomes free by some sort of method like governments give free phones issued to non banked they go for bitcoin making it raise in usage and price possibly within next ten years. They would do this because the phones actually help track bitcoin movements.
@_date: 2019-09-16 04:57:08
Best way to tell you is transaction scaling along with miners set their own fees. If bitcoin needs smaller fees than bitcoin will get smaller fees... Layer two solutions as well like lightning network. This article shows changes in network transaction fees useful information..

Thanks for the future 1 million :-) I’m looking in to the process...
@_date: 2019-09-15 17:35:16

@_date: 2019-09-16 06:31:59
800 sats could be worth something nice and in those times fees would be lowered so you could use it. Funny thing is most will forget about those amounts and realize it later... So if 10 sats equaled 10,000 you would have 800K USD
I’m assuming it would cost atleast 1 sat to move... that’s so sat, I mean sad....
You never know! Lets watch grass... I mean bitcoin grow!
@_date: 2019-09-15 19:50:51
Furthermore I’ll add that 0.0001 BTC for example and other values will be referred to for instance 10,000 Sats or Satoshi. 
You are in the early days!
@_date: 2019-09-14 05:07:20
You just accept it that is the option lol...  and then bring it to exchange when your ready for some other currency fiat.
