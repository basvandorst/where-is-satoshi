I find it funny that now we can send pings with money :-) By default the page asks for about 0.05USD. With that amount at risk, you should be more concerned with the network fees that are lost in the process.

Got it. Nice music.
@_date: 2014-06-12 06:25:49
I got it but I will not use it. First comment who wants it gets it :-)
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:33:11
Same here. I then logged in in the website and they say that the order is unfulfilled, so I guess I'll get an email later.
I'm not planning to listen to the album. I can give it away to somebody who likes rap.

I went to a Bitcoin congress in Argentina in December/2013 and a copy of this was auctioned for 11 BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:01:38
I'll PM you.

It not very good to determine if a sequence looks random enough with the naked eye.
You might want to try diehard (or dieharder). I remeber Donald Knuth said these tests are good in one of his books.

I use it to explain people how bitcoin works. I make a small transaction and then click in the blockchain.info links and explain people what is happening. I tell them what is happening in their wallets, what is happening in the blockchain and what the server is doing. I used to do this with a donation to the FSF or giving reddit gold, but then I realized I was spending too much money and that an echo server would be better. Or course, I could also transfer to a public address of mine but the echo server is more fun :-)
@_date: 2014-10-04 06:18:41
I am sorry :-) Give me an address and I'll send you more than 10000 satoshis. We can still catch up!

Hey there. One of the co-organizers of the Bitcoin Meetup in Bogotá and also couchsurfer. If you come here, I can host you and it would be nice to have a meetup in your honor here :-) Beers are on us. In case you end up here, my email is nelsoneci

I see. I still find it a bit weird. In Bitcoin you can watch a public address without 'touching' it.

Some time ago I noticed the Pettycoin project, which is not an altcoin but a way to make bitcoin payments scale. It is and targeted at small payments. I think the scalability issue can be solved without an altcoin.

The code is not ready yet. It is under development. It uses gateways.
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:30:20
Thanks. I just bought a gift code and then a kindle book. I needed this.
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:49:00
Not that I know. We could put it to work on testnet also.
@_date: 2015-05-18 12:13:36
What good is a bigger block size if you cannot enforce it anyway? BW pool mined a 50k block! I wonder if they are aiming for shorter propagation times.
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:37:15
Carlos, thanks for posting. We noticed there is no (popular) echo server so we coded one. Comments are welcome!
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:16:44
Thanks. I just got one with discount and 20_OFF_PLAY code.

I did this experiment a while ago with the name of a friend. His name is not very common (3 words in Spanish). I sent just a little. It was stolen immediately so people do permutations with a big dictionary.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:47:08
Nice idea.
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:21:23
That was a good video. I hadn't watched his interviews in a while and I like how he is explaining new concepts. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:19:53
Yes, but not for all transactions. When 40 is not enough, multisig is used.
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:58:16
Some people like to trade. Go to to learn about it :-P
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:51:24
8X is a constant factor. Not that useful, but better than nothing. Thinking of Big(O) here.

Very soon.  --

Same here. About 6 hours :-/ I just noticed new blocks have more than 0.2 BTC in fees.
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:26:39
Great video. Now I have a mental image of the guy behind the music.

I bought a cheap ticket once. I said to myself:  want to be stupid today.
Better than drinking alcohol :-)

I'm so tired of hearing this over and over :-/ People repeating without knowing what asymptotic growth means.
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:30:50
Thanks. Sent there.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:35:25
I like the API.
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:01:41
Looking forward to meet Colombian bitcoiners there.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:43:37
They just share the name. They are not related.
@_date: 2013-10-22 03:38:11
I'm waiting for registration to open. Seems pretty interesting.
