Did you have any loans to repay? Or are you Non-US?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:17:29
I don't know the situation for university in Australia so you may or may not have a point, I guess people from your country could debate that. But I think you got downvoted a bit because in the US, where the older generations still heavily encourage children to go to college, and college tuition and fees are completely astronomical, it's relatively normal to come out of college owing more than 100k to a private loan company. I don't intend to debate whether or not that's a good decision (it probably isn't for a lot of fields), just explaining why saving 50k is pretty rare and not very accurate for the average middle class fresh college grad. The US population currently owes between 900 billion and 1 trillion dollars in college loan debt, with the average per capita being around 25k.

Do we know if this was sold at spot on an exchange? Has anybody looked up the tx? Sorry for not doing it myself but until we know that, we don't really know the narrative. So saying that miners are capitulating and miners are dumping is a biased take. Could easily rewrite the headline "miners contracted to sell large portions of freshly minted coin to institutional buyers" and then instead of FUD, this action is seen as bullish

The slide with the chart, the downtrend, etc. Do you trust the folks who put that slide together?
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:21:01
Fair point if that's your opinion. no one has a crystal ball, after all. but in the context of his comment where bitcoin is manipulated to allow a few people to get very rich... well.. the easiest way for that to be the case would be where btc winds up being worth something. i suppose maybe he means they are getting rich by shorting and they'll eventually crash it and not care? i guess that's possible ?

In the scenario where 3 bitcoin is worth either 10 or 2 million, i'm pretty sure you could wipe your tears or your ass with either denomination

the timing was nice to suck in retail. and it did. coinbase was the  app in the app store there for a couple months.
but it was primarily institutional money building up a stash of real bitcoin to manipulate price once paper futures launched

hey man, the fundamentals right now are great. can you hold this bag while i sell and buy lower

Thats a shit response dude. We should encourage bright and experienced minds in this space. Needs them to grow.

I guess the idea is it's more of a short-term stopgap and to watch the news closely
@_date: 2019-05-02 22:06:54
That's a good point. Holding the coins by themselves, theoretically you'd be obligated to pay the taxes on it, versus a tax shelter in the IRA which could justify a premium at least in the short term. Thanks for pointing that out.

60 minutes tends to average around 10 million viewers. But i think important here is that it's more of the boomer generation that isn't yet in bitcoin and at the same time are thinking about finances as they move towards retirement

Yeah I don't see how this won't plummet back to real value when an ETF is approved. Premium is now what, 35%? 40%?
