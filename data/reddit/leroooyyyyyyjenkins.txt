in the next few bubbles and after the next halving, if things are still looking heLthy. it probably will hit those 6 digit [numbers.]( you might wanna have some . Even 1 or less

which is what I said so your repeating me. And ta isn’t a crystal ball but is sure as hell helps. sure has been working very profitable for me maybe you’re just not good at it.
@_date: 2019-11-25 12:44:32
your in a downward range and overdue for a pump so what? You could go to 9k and it wouldn’t change anything either bc still making lower highs
@_date: 2019-11-15 05:03:56
@_date: 2019-11-21 05:37:33
It’s a slight setback And I’ve got bags to fill
@_date: 2019-11-16 20:58:30
i can’t wait until The halving and price is barely coming back up to 10 k. I’ll be accumulating hard while retailers will be shitting themselves as price continues to drop.
@_date: 2019-11-23 02:53:33
i place buy orders all The way down once a certain retracement is reached. Cheaper is just a bonus. I’ve learned to take the emotion out completely.

Oh boohoo. only moon boys think everything should go straight up and never come back down. It’s actually healthy and gets me even more bullish for the next one. If I can get 4K btc I’ll be even happier.
@_date: 2019-11-10 21:05:19

@_date: 2019-11-18 21:36:07
This exactly how it goes. I expect some dark months ahead of sideways movement, bear rallies that will get moon boys hyped to buy back in only to create lower highs, and lots of continued Downward movement. It is in these areas of value though That the bull begins. It’s almost as if all the sentiment must be crushed and all the moon boys go into hiding and sell off. That’s when it comes back to life. I still will Be accumulating and just expecting lower lows bc then you can’t be disappointed.
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:02:20
downtrend, accumulation and then start to break these resistance levels one by one. A lot of work to do. won’t be soon but We could also create a lower high rally around12 k and then sell off again And create a higher low as well.  I see another 1.5-2 years before we start breaking ath.

Depends on how You’re looking at it but I say no. Yes we’ve never had a yearly lower low. But it’s clear we’ve been in a straight path to around 6 by sometime next year. I can’t say that’s even remotely bullish as a trader. Lmao

this is why you learn a little ta, layer in,and grow a pair. Set your stop loss and then eat your loss and re enter. Or play the long game. You may have to wait a year or so and we may lose half of our current value. But this bitch will rise from the ashes once you moon boys get ground to dust and sentiment is completely destroyed.

Store of value. thats Enough for it to make 10-12 x gains over the next 5 years. If your a holder you need to be patient as hell. Your day will come. as a savings account it will likely provide way more return than a bank account where u actually lose money due to inflation
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:35:20
You have zero evidence. If anything you get another dead bounce to maaayyyyybeee 9k and that’s being generous.

your good man. Dca and bitcoin will still be here. It’s not going to the moon anytime soon. But be aware we are in a range that goes as high as about mid 9k. and low as high 5-6k.The amount of extra bitcoin you get now with your buy is significant but not worth losing sleep over. Try to do an extra job and get extra money if your that concerned.

We’re in a channel that ranges about 4K dollars from top to bottom. I see us bouncing lower but also part of me thinks it’s not as bad as the fud we’re being told. Even if we do hit some lower lows. Hold your bitcoin close and don’t try and sell to buy back in. You’ll get wrecked usually
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:54:02
I think that’s where you’re completely wrong. it’s apparent institutions are laughing their asses off and accumulating at areas Of value. Stupid retailers will sell off again and then want back in when btc is back at 20 k.
@_date: 2019-11-16 04:45:10
don’t care if it goes to 1k. I’ll be buying more. And shorting all the way down , slicing through moon boys.

@_date: 2019-11-15 20:52:41
Halving Doesn’t just set off the boom. It’s usually starting to pick up by then and then the whole year after it is when it sets in. If anything I expect us to grind out some lows, grind out some weak hands for the next few months. Small lower high pumps, and continue to go down until we plateau around or even after. Yes it could be priced In. Once sentiment is gone and value is priced wewillstart to move up opinion so don’t @ me
@_date: 2019-11-28 22:31:14
Stop using them. I can get btc cheaper and easier than dealing with some fractional reserves exchange. I haven’t used the exchange except the occasional price info to compare
@_date: 2019-11-23 22:56:31
I just put in bigger orders Stair stepping down from 7.2k. fib Levels actually are amazing for deciding where to go in heavier. It takes the emotion out that much more And anything cheaper is just a cherry on top. there’s nothing wrong with loading up more in value areas

Yup . This is kind of the beauty of dollar cost averaging. but yes had you bought the same amount at 6 k it would have averaged out to somewhere around 9 k which is getting closer to golden zone. fibonacci Levels are great for figuring out value areas if your patient

There wasn’t dude. Sure a dead bounce yes but not a full trend reversal. It’s really not that bad. We could go down to 3k and I would maybe get slightly concerned. But we’re good and bitcoin has needed a healthy base . I had 6 k marked out as a posible floor. But who knows. I’ll fill my bags all the way down
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:16:40
The blockchain is a powerful truth machine that is the exact opposite of our current fiat system. Millennials are already burnt out with the banks as we’ve watched them get bailed out, take everything from the people, and never give back. Millennials I believe will also pass on this distrust to their kids and this new generation will not be so willing to accept the shit system we have. Bitcoin will be the purest most incorruptible store of value in all of existence. About as close to a god as you could imagine
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:30:22

I think we know it’s a farce. It would be like Nike promoting a different shoe vendor. It’s all business and the guy has bitcoin.

over hype imo. I honestly see us continuing the trend and making another lower high and quite possibly lower low. Isn’t the end of the world bc it does appear we are in a flag . We have a lot of overhead resistance that not only needs to get ripped through but stay above. Hold and then begin to go for that higher high. It could take months.
@_date: 2019-11-16 21:04:36

It’s a cycle that all markets repeat. Btc and crypto are well known to have deep retracements. Shedding 70% of their peak rally value on average. nothing changes as 4- low 6 k is still possible as we follow this channel.9 k is a high pump it could make. good thing the end is near , bad thing. Is it usually has a hard dump before recovering and going for ath. No true recovery for months

no effect this time . Look at it in log scale. Plant your halving lines and tell me what it does. Well yep looks like we’re headed lower like it usually does after a blow off and before a halving. And then way after it goes up. Hodlers need to be prepared for accumulation where btc just dumps and then ranges slightly up for hundreds of days

I think you guys should be aware of how bitcoin retraces its highs. anywhere from 80-95% is normal. I don’t think we’ll see that deep but hodlers and moon boys should accept that 5-6k is entirely possible. i Will be stocking up if we hit those prices as the next bull market will prob be 6 figures at peak

i think anyone with a functioning brain and who truly believes in bitcoin should  be buying right now. take that however you want but the facts laid out are that bitcoin has always pulled back at least. 70% before bouncing back and absolutely crushing it. You’ll find that in no traditional market. Btc is a risk already and right Now the best move over panic selling or straight holding is buying in more
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:43:20

@_date: 2019-12-29 19:55:10
Depends.  u could break it up into 1/10 and invest over a certain amount of time. Or just buy two bitcoin now and buy a few ledgers maybe like 4-5 and spread it out on them. I personally would slowly invest unless you have the conviction to buy two bitcoin and not care if it goes down to 5 k and you could have bought 3 bitcoin. It’s up to u but overall yes you should have some exposure

Idiots always nutting over every dead bounce all the way down. It’s sickening and yet hilarious and a little sad. People are so emotionally invested in bitcoin they need a bounce just to feel alive. I for one love lower accumulation zones with low risk. Bring 4-5k in the following months

Bitcoin will be the one that is a store of value. I see nothing taking that, aside from that many crypto’s will make massive roi and alot will near zero. It’s your job to do your homework and pick which ones you gamble on. Ill Be comfortable holding about 95% bitcoin and 5% shit coins with very specific uses. I also know that some I pick will go to zero but that is a well rounded amount of risk for me

He’s not asking for your opinions on day trading. If he wants to learn let him learn. I use margin trading. Anything else like coinbase is not good for trading. I suggest bitmex but watch out for the wicks and bybit. Start small and check out Jacob Canfield channel he’s got some decent tips I see for someone like you who’s wanting to learn. Yes you will lose some but there’s also a lot to make with proper risk and bank roll management . Also good idea having a hodl position. dont Be discouraged . You can honestly win 1/3 trades and be profitable I know bc I’ve done it .

I think it’s a bad idea but hey do what you want. Shitcoins are probably your best bet. Then convert to bitcoin. Or hodl them. There’s potential to make huge amounts of money.

@_date: 2019-12-08 19:41:32
First you need to ditch the get rich quick mentality. once You’ve pondered on that for a while then realize bitcoin will more than likely go Down as soon as you buy it. If you’re ok with those two things and can look at things on the macro chart level then you’ll do just fine.
most important reason I hold almost everything in crypto: Financial freedom and no one can touch my money without the Keys. It is my own vault. I care nothing about the short term and I love seeing the price go lower. Sick? Maybe but in my heart I believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get in on the bitcoin blockchain. To own something special.  I really think you need to listen to mr  aantonop on youtube.
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:39:51
All he means is the dollar is stronger compared to other currencies. And it has been mostly true as the race to devalue all fiat is underway. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the dollar has more purchasing power and that’s due to a few factors

That is still a bit troubling imo but maybe not. Say it did happen how would that affect the overall average of mining if say quantum did mine several blocks And then stop. Would the difficulty slowly adjust back down and overall the same amount of blocks would be mined or would the difficulty increasing affect the mining negatively . I can’t word it quite right but hopefully you get my drift
