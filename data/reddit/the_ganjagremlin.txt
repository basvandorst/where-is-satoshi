you clearly misunderstood, I'm talking if you bought bitcoin at 2k/btc and the price was at 4k/btc you are still at 200% of your investment. Its much easier to see the price dip as recoverable, which is a totally subjective analysis in any case unless you are a fortune teller. Even if BTC drops 90% theres no guarantee that it doesn't rise up to a new ATH in the future, considering this happened once before. 
My point is that its much easier to deal with a dip if you bought in at a lower price. I didn't think that was even gonna be controversial lol.

The next week the son had become very sick from an infected leg. The neighours came to offer their sympathy for his misfortune. "May be..." murmured the farmer.
The next week, a kind nobleman came to the town. He was conducting a census and seeking to improve the villagers lot. Seeing the sons broken leg, he was moved to come and provide a doctor for the village. The neighbours came by again and congratulated him because his sons injury had made their life that much better. "May be," said the farmer and the neighbours left.
When they were gone the farmer said "goddamnit these fucking people are never going to leave me alone now"

up 100 but at 200% of their original investment I did phrase it badly
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:28:29
those were the prices a few months ago tho which were still nothing to scoff at. Ofc if you bought at 15k you're going to think that 4k is a shit price, but people who bought in at 2k a coin would still be at 200% of their initial investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:40:23
100% + 100% = 200%
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:20:11
but if you bought in at 2k and its 4k you have made double your investment, how is this so hard
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:28:20
doubling your investment is an increase by 100% tho. If I had 20 and I make 20 that is 100% of my investment, an increase of 100%, so the 40 dollars total that I have is 200% of my original investment

no they are wage slaves because they are dependent on their wage and will go broke without it


my ideology is don't get exploited idk what this has to do with anything you're talking about unless you think that for some reason building highways in the imperialist shitty USA is justifying this whole system because it produces an efficient way for engineers to build a fucking road like wat? or are you saying that people should sacrifice themselves for the greater good? okay then... if that good is meaningfull and not stock prices for some chinese engineering firm, sure. Doyou have no dignity or self worth? Wow this random piece of technology that may or may not improve anyones lives is so important dude people should be treated like slaves so that people they will never meet can enjoy products they will never be able to afford xD

yeah theres massive financial industry interested in btc and money going in, its absurd to think that anything other than the exposure of a fundamental flaw in crypto itself will wipe out Bitcoin lmfao wtf. The global financial system could collapse overnight too and while theres some signs of bad trends, nobody seriously thinks its going to happen tomorrow.

Don't put in more money than you can afford to lose, do your own research. You can easily make some decent money on BTC just don't be dumb
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:30:25
dude says BTC might fall to 8k so its gonna plummet to 5k tomorrow??? idk man I feel like this website is just hedging its bet, picking a steady growth in the long term and a big crash in the short. That's perfect bait to get people to buy 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:29:44

I'm sure they said the same thing about people who bought in at 500, 5000, 10,000 lmfao. There is plenty of money to be made in BTC, in both the short and long term. You're just salty about something or maybe the MILLENIALS at your office are confusing you with this bitcoin talk and your obamacare doesn't cover valium so you have to come cry to us? either way nobody is impressed

[Bitcoin begins trading on the futures market]( This is essentially a gamble on the price of what a certain commodity will be worth at a certain time, its kinda complicated idek the whole process really, but suffice to say it gives more legitimacy and capital backing for BTC. This should hopeully drive the price up. Some people think it will crash. We'll see soon I guess!
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:24:37
yeah added security through futures trading is going to cause bitcoin to become less valuble 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:12:22

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:53:41
its a pol meme, the only people who 'like' their jobs are delusional or very, very lucky. I find it suspicious when so many people come to claim they love their work, if they are not looking back with nostalgia or internalizing certain thoughts to convince themselves the job they are forced to do is enjoyable or fulfilling. Besides which, enjoying doing something doesn't mean doing it as a job is enjoyable. I enjoy cooking, I suppose, but I hate cooking for people as a job. Some people enjoy building things, buildings, etc, but as projects for themselves, doing it as a job still brings a lot of baggage along that makes the experience suck.

bitcoins are abot to become more secured and acepted by the mainstream and the price is currently dropping, idk how this is a bad thing, its almost certainly going to shoot up past the ATH within a couple weeks of bitcoin trading on futures from what I can understand, so right now you're literally being given a chance to make some good money in a couple of weeks

your transaction is locked in at the price you bought it for, so what is the problem? its obviously going to go back up, around 20k will probably be the comfortable sitting point for next months with spikes up ad down in either direction. when it hits 20k you just made 1250 dollars

how is acknowleding that working for the betterment of others versus myself is not enjoyable a sad outlook on life? i'd say people who internalize their wage slavery and justify/celebrate it have the sad outlook, that is an outlook that explicitly says this is as good as it gets, ie being poor (compared to your boss certainly) and spending an inordinate amount of time during your youth and prime years working for someone else, being exhausted and unable to do anything else with your day, having 2 out of 7 days of the week where you don't have to drag yourself out of bed to go somewhere you hate, having to worry about losing that job and money, etc. Idk how anyone can act like this is a good state of affairs that a person should enjoy being forced to participate in

I was gonna sell last night but I thought I would give it a chance lel. I don't think it's going to rise back up to 10k anytime soon, probably will go down some more and stay low befoe slowly rising up again. Chinese ban is gonna be a huge blow no matter what people on here are saying, this isn't going to be like the previous BTC dips cause there is so much forces working against BTC and other crypto right now. bans from countries in the developing world are gonna hit particularly hard 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:32:54
if BTC rises again there will be even more hype tho, it's already in the public consciousness and a rebound from this big ass dip would make it seem more legitimate and counter people who say its a bubble. Lots of people didn't get in last time, despite the lots who did, so this time I see even more people buying in. 
not saying I believe it will happen but its logical. tbh I just want like 14k prices again so I can exchange the last of my BTC  without taking a hit from those high fees I paid in november :\
