Yes, a Bitcoin can be broken down into the smallest denomination, a Satoshi (named after the creator), which is 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin. 
However, that does not mean limited supply does not matter. You wouldn't say that being able to turn a US Dollar into 100 pennies would make it less valuable, would you? It's still 100 pennies.

Yep! It's just as Fiat as everything else, with one difference - once Bitcoin hits 21,000,000 mined, it will cease to be produced. Meaning, it has a limited supply, while other fiat currencies do not. The respective governments could print as much as they wanted. Given, it wouldn't be in their interest to.

Fiat currencies are currencies (Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen, etc) that are not backed by a physical item. In ye olden dayes, in the US, each dollar was worth a certain amount of gold. This kept it relatively stable in value. However, as moving and buying tons of gold isn't exactly practical these days, most monies are now what they call Fiat, in that they are backed by nothing but the trust people put in them. 
The (fake) tweet is a car company making a joke about having the same name as these currencies.

If it takes 20 minutes for a transaction to verify, then how on earth do you expect to use bitcoin in daily transactions? Every time I want to buy a tank of gas or buy a coffee, I don't wanna sit there and wait for 10-20 minutes for my transaction to verify. It's not practical.

That's not what he meant, he meant that they're all running from the same company. If that company were to decide to change it's mind, then those 20 tellers it hired get sacked and suddenly you have a shortage of tellers. 
I don't agree with it anyway. Segwit2x is a key step in making Crypto more realistic in real-world usage.
