Actually, the timechain could act as a very simple 'insurance policy' against rampant killing that you speak of. If I have my own private keys that are 'lost' when I die, what is to stop me from having a secondary access to those wallets through a timechain? Thus the motive of eliminating the total BTC in circulation by killing me is moot.

I think it makes perfect sense for a millionaire to want to spend their money when compared to someone who is broke.
I was speaking from my own personal sentiment. I understood the point you were trying to make that 'people will be less likely to spend if they have deflationary currency' however I am giving you my honest opinion on current valuation. 
I am taking into account price increase in my comment. Who can say what the value will be tomorrow? If you are a magical wizard and could project future values and rate of change I would implore you to tell me your secret. But since no one really knows, as greenearplugs stated, 'if a user believe that fair value has been reached they are more likely to spend bitcoin...' 
So yeah, if a bitcoin was worth $1 million dollars I would spend the shit out of it.

I don't like that term. Rot seems like a poor choice for the gradual loss. Physical dollar bills can rot, but the digital coins are as permanent as can be.
It seems to me the 'loss' of coins is more like evaporation. They don't deteriorate, they just change from a retrievable state like water in a bowl to vapor in the air that is no longer under anyone's control. It goes to join the cloud so to speak.

It seems to me that there is the possibility that Karpeles may have been encountering undue government pressure from investigations, attempted siezures. In an effort to reboot maybe he is secretly planning on shedding the old company and setting up shop in a friendlier country and planned on honoring deposits from MT Gox in the reboot. He might have a gag order which is why he is being elusive. I doubt he thinks he could get away with such a theft.

That is a fascinating point about Damocles's sword! Could this usher a new era of worldwide peace?
Clearly Satoshi is Elon Musk and he will fly to Mars and die there and spend his last few years hiding the private keys to vast wealth on the Martian surface. In addition he will send rockets with private keys to every possibly habitable planetoid, or moon in our solar system to prompt us to finally become a space faring species...  Then for his eulogy there is the big reveal. Thus the impetus for us to colonize Mars and the rest of the solar system. Damn, I wish this were true, Elon Musk is the man and Satoshi is our savior. My mind would be blown if they were the same person!

I posted this on their public FAQ but here is betting that they won't approve this for viewing on their website:
What more do you need from me to prove that I am not a "high risk". I have provided email and linked to TWO separate verified banking institutions and funded a purchase of bitcoins and waited the full week for the transaction (meanwhile it rose 20% in value). 
First of all, if you deemed me high risk why would you wait the entire waiting period to cancel the transaction? Especially after you have the REAL money from my bank in your possession?
Who does business like this? I understand bitcoins are risking with not being able to reverse transactions and all, but I thought you mitigated that risk with the week long waiting period.
Don't get me wrong, I want to do business with you, but you can't do business with me like this or otherwise I'll take my money elsewhere. (and not have to wait 30 days.)
@_date: 2013-02-09 19:47:35
Hi Fred,
I am new to bitcoin and signed up and initiated a transaction on your very user friendly coinbase website. I really like the interface and like your setup from what I have seen so far, however, my one complaint, however, is that I would like to be able to buy more bitcoin! The waiting period is killing me, and I understand you certainly have risk to manage, but I honestly feel that the floodgate for increasing popularity is really determined by ease of entry into the bitcoin economy.
Your platform lowers the bar both through ease of transaction and low percentage cuts and that is quite significant to those interested in jumping into the bitcoin economy with you. Are you going to allow for larger transactions in the near future? Is there going to ever be a way to be verified faster? Is purchase using credit cards also out of the question (I like to utilize rewards points even when I pay 'in cash' for things)? 
I think from your recent success in the past month alone you guys are going to grow substantially. Is there also any consideration for lowering your % take for larger transactions (therefore encouraging larger investment)?

@_date: 2013-02-12 03:02:10
Does anyone else find Coinbase's practices to be highly suspicious? Consider my recent interaction with them. I recently purchased a small amount from them only to have them cancel my 'high risk' transaction after waiting a full week (and taking the money from my verified bank account [one of two verified accounts with them]) and this is after bitcoin went up 40% in value...  
Here is my complaint to Brian Armstrong:
""Brian, Can you please explain to me why you would deem me having conducted a 'high risk transaction' when not only did I have a verified email with you in addition to not only one, but TWO verified bank accounts (with two separate financial institutions might I add)?
Not only that, but why would you wait a whole WEEK before deciding to cancel the transaction? Meanwhile bitcoin went up 40% in value and I was wasting time waiting for your transaction only to have lost out on the gains I otherwise would have had. And to think I was going to have to wait an additional 30 days to make any substantial purchase still with your company...
I find it grossly ironic, that your business model seems to remove all the appeal which drew me to bitcoin in the first place. Which was no hassle, quick transactions, and limited third party manipulation. It is tragic, rather, that my business will go elsewhere (you have a nice interface that I would love to use!) but as of right now, I have no faith that you won't cancel future investment by me in the future simply because of a whim (or because your automated computing algorithm).
Can you please defend yourself against that allegations I have seen levied on here from some users that you cancel purchases 'conveniently' when bitcoin price rises significantly? I don't know your business model, but it would make sense that that would benefit you, especially if you were sitting on large reserves. In other words, you could be hedging buyer's money at no risk to yourself...."""
@_date: 2013-02-12 05:04:56
I did both 2 small transactions and direct verification. I was cancelled with a 20% on a max 10 bitcoin purchase after the money was already withdrawn and ACH'd from my bank account. IE they had my real money in their possession and deemed it was 'high risk'.

I am recent addition to the Bitcoin community, and therefore the type of latecomer that I think you all would be interested in appealing to. (That being said, the notion of Bitcoin's existence had been in the back of my head for the past year or so but I never acted on it until my roommate went ahead and bought some last month.) 
As I have recently come to become obsessed with the implications of this unregulated currency and see its world changing potential (economic singularity so to speak,  I am convinced that this is the way of the future as I am sure most of you feel, too. That being said, I feel that the best direction we should be giving ourselves and to others especially unfamiliar with the currency is to insist on accepting payments from people in bitcoin in the real world.
For instance, in any future transactions I will ask for payment in bitcoin which doubly benefits both of individuals if we both own bitcoin. Firstly, the over market capitalization for bitcoin increases for our own bitcoin savings by infusion of funds (which the individual paying me will have to be spending and 'losing' anyway), and secondly, I gain more access to bitcoins through a direct transfer rather than having to go through exchanges and avoid all the bank transaction fees (getting to the purest form and initial intended basic means of transaction, P2P). 
As I think about it some more I feel that you are absolutely touting the wrong sentiment about utilizing bitcoin. On the contrary, I think the best thing for the entire Bitcoin economy is to keep BUYING bitcoin! As it grows, there is more incentive for infrastructure development and easier interfacing and more incentive for more and more day to day products being available with this currency...it is only a matter of time for this to be as common place as cash and credit cards.
@_date: 2013-02-12 02:44:25
Brian, 
I like your company, your interface and the convenience of getting into the bitcoin market is absolutely imperative in order for bitcoin to take off and go mainstream. That being said, I as well as some others have had some frustration with canceled orders. Fred has since resolved my specific complaint, so I am happy to continue doing buisness with y'all however,  can you please explain to me why you would deem me having conducted  a 'high risk transaction' when not only did I have a verified email with you in addition to not only one, but TWO verified bank accounts (with two separate financial institutions might I add)? 
I have observed that some individuals have made allegations that your company cancels purchases 'conveniently'  when bitcoin price rises significantly. This is bad PR and I certainly hope not to be the case. I don't know your business model and what you can actually share publically, but could you maybe explain to me how to ensure I don't get cancellations again in the future? I just don't want to be make a purchase only to have a week go by and miss out on a big upswing.
Again, I look forward to a long and prosperous business relationship with your company, I just would like to get past some of these hiccups.

The more I think about this the more I realize this is genius. One of the biggest proposed issues and fears has been government intervention and shutting down the exchanges, but if we made the exchanges as open source and P2P as the currency itself they couldn't shut down any of it! Not only that but we'd have a win win by getting away from the Mt. Gox troubles we have encountered thus far. You guys are amazing!
@_date: 2013-02-10 00:54:48
But subsequently wouldn't such banning only bring Bitcoin onto the radar of the general public and therefore bring more attention to it and more interest? I don't believe that the government can do anything to stop its eventual rise. By the time it is debated on the house floor, I hope there will be so many invested in it that there would be a public outcry (wishful thinking?).
Aside from that the US has been dreadfully awful in the 'war on drugs' and that involves movement of actual goods in the real world. So to shut down this digital currency I feel that they would have to shut down the internet entirely if that realistically wanted to stop Bitcoin. And there is no way in hell they are keeping the American public from their porn and streaming media. 
Imagine if Bitcoin were to have complete adoption by a sovereign nation as an accepted national currency, then it would be securely grounded for good...

I guess people are thinking that they would have to lug the gold around? That isn't what I was thinking in the slightest. The gold standard, as I understood it, simply applying the limited supply concept (such as bitcoin) therefore anchoring whatever currency was based on it to that limited supply. I wasn't advocating having to walk around with a bag of gold slung around my neck.

Fjordo, the frustration Vibr8gKiwi felt is likely the same I felt. Generally suspicion of a new company (dealing with a slippery new currency) compounded by a week long waiting period for a transaction to go through only to be canceled should rightly so generate some questions.
I am happy to say that I had resolution of my complaint after direct contact with the company, however, it is important for everyone, including the bitcoin community, the consumers, and even Coinbase, that complaints and patterns are out in the open. I for one am not looking to screw anyone over and I understand we all have to watch out for those who will, it is important to respect people's feedback and to not shun it. Together we are all the trailblazers with bitcoin and we will all benefit together if we allow ourselves to.

I have thought about this long and hard and the idea recently came to me. What if we approached an impoverished Indian reservation in the United States with the purpose of establishing a BTC oriented libertarian haven? This may be the way to stay in the US but be protected...

Yeah, they cancelled my order, and I find it funny that  I was deemed high risk after they already had my money. They fixed my canceled order and I just hope it was a glitch and not indicative of something else.

Did that purchase go through?

Would there be a way you could lock down your wallet to limit the size of outgoing transactions or provide a mandatory waiting period. That way if someone was trying to loot your wallet you could maybe have 24 hours to respond and then lock down your account so that you could have time to change your password or something to that effect? Who do I need to talk to to make this a reality?

Hopefully they fix their algorithm!

I feel like this clarification is significant coming from you
@_date: 2013-02-12 04:39:05
I was worried that they were using the 'high risk' cancellation to gamble with our money. I now believe that that is probably just indicative of their growing pains.

Did you ever get attention or a response to rectify your issues? I hope that pikeadz's complaint wasn't only addressed because this post received attention in this very important forum. 
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:09:53
I'll be sure to post their response. Issue resolved (Posted above in the edit.)

How do you reconcile years of forking where a significant shift in individual  Bitcoin ownership occurred? Not only that, but what is stopping someone from spending there thousands of Bitcoins in Country A for one purchase and simultaneously spending those sames coins in Country B for another purchase. This is effectively the double spending issue associated with a fork and the longer any engagement carries on the worse it will be and harder it would be to rectify.

I got fucked over in the exact same way. But coinbase contacted me directly and demonstrated it was just growing pains. I am happy with their product so far.

I didn't abandon the desire, so to speak, I just kinda gave up on spending time trying to influence people on the matter politically.  
A gold standard, if implemented appropriately would mirror the 'limited supply' quality aspect of Bitcoin and therefore limit inflationary spending, right? So why do you feel Gold is inadequate?
