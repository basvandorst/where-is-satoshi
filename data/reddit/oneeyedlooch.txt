Wow ok.  Thought there were certain withdraw amounts, like you could only withdraw 10k or 25k of profits at a time.

Can you please indulge a novice?  If I had 10k of Bitcoin in 2010 and it’s now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, how would I be able to cash out in USD$?  Could I withdraw my bitcoin and wire hundreds of millions into my checking account?  Thank you in advance.

Can I ask a question as a novice?  
Say I invested 10k 7 years ago and now have hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.
Can I easily transfer that into $USD?  Would that be possible- to “cash out” and to wire all bitcoin profits into dollars?
Please and thank you.

Very helpful,  thanks so much.  Was uncertain about withdrawal amount limits and you cleared that up.  Will there ever be a time where one can liquidate all their bitcoins in one transaction, regardless of size?

Got it.  So the max withdraw per day is 100k?  Thanks for the note.
