In Germany, post offices provide a service called "post ident" which makes it possible to easily identify yourself against a company (using the post office as a proxy). Seems like this easy route of identification is not possible from abroad.

They don't have any source code. They aren't programs.

See the limitation as a challenge. Here is an [example]( of what is possible in one kilobyte. Use Chrome for best results and turn your sound on.

False. If it would follow the naming conventions (which is either X + two letters or two-letter-country-code + first letter of currency), it would be either XEU or EUE, assuming that EU is a country.

Sorry, the title is wrong. It's actually one Satoshi per hour. So for one year you pay 8760 Satoshi. You know, for one dollar (at a rate of $500 per Bitcoin), you can get a subdomain for 22 years.

It plays music in the background. The PNG is just for extra compression; the page loads itself as an image and decodes Javascript from the pixel data.

Except if you're important. Then you can do stuff like EUR (instead of XEU).

Painful? You just go to any post office, say "please identify me" and show them the reference number you got from bitcoin.de. I guess it's a bit more difficult if you aren't from Germany.

The fine print says the Giana Sisters will only be available for Linux later this year. Looking at the history of the Humble Bundles, it's likely that the port is going to happen.

Do you also need someone to turn off your capslock?

Many correncies use $. Many asian currencies use ¥ or 圓 if written in Chinese characters. So why exactly is it a problem that more than one currency uses ฿?
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:36:12
Ah, yes. That's right. I'm sorry. Still, almost nothing.

Yes exactly. It's called »Seidenstraßenprojekt« (project silk road). We use flexible drainage pipes that are operated with vacuums.

They aren't self-signed. They use CACert. Stop spreading wrong information please.

The Chinese says 「創客護照」 which means "Hacker's passport" or rather "maker's passport". It's a passport you can use to collect stamps of various hacker spaces.

I am sorry. I must say that I did not actually read the submission text. Shame on me.

The transportation limit is 500 grams (about one pound) and these cups contain 100ml each. No problem here.

I'll try to make some once my phone calms down.

This service essentially serves as an escrow for your private messages. What a stupid idea. Who guarantees me that ViaCRYPT really deletes the messages? Who guarantees me the messages are encrypted?
There is a reason cryptography is designed without needing a trusted third party.

The Seidenstraße is a series of tubes!

Japanese has only around 50 syllables, soyou can probably get Satoshi Nakamoto from everywhere. Additionally, Satoshi is a pretty common first name and Nakamoto is a common last name.

No it hasn't. Miners might refuse to include your transaction, but there is no lower limit on transaction fees. You could even use a fee of 0 BTC if you wanted. Generally, even "dust" transaction have a chance of getting included if you hold your coins for a couple of months.

Then use a different client. Neither does anybody force you to use Bitcoin QT nor is the wallet file restricted to Bitcoin QT.
Stop whining like somebody who cannot get over a gap but refuses to jump.
