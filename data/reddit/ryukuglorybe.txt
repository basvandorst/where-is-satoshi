Not really, printing money is almost exclusively just replacing old money that's worn out. If the Fed wants to mess with inflation they look at interest rates and bond buying.

Think about this: would you ever take out a car loan in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:27:20


Exactly! This is key to why inflation is a good thing - when you take out that car loan you increase your economic output by more than just the value of the car, you can now drive to your better job where your labor is allocated more efficiently. In return the creditor gets the guarantee that they'll get more money over time. None of that is possible under a deflationary currency as it's not remotely feasible to tale loans out when the burden will only increase as time goes on.

That's the point of interest, more or less.

There are really two options for this scenario: 
1) BTC's value is slaved to the main currency and it becomes sort of a chunk of the M0 supply. This ends up being more or less neutral as the it effectively stops being a currency and becomes something like an anonymous, slow debit card. 
2) BTC is independently used for transactions. This will definitely create deflationary pull, as the deflationary nature of BTC means that large amount of the money supply become tied down as savings in it, hurting growth.

Nah, even a small amount of deflation is bad, unlike inflation it doesn't drive investment and growth.

1) Bitcoin is fiat money
2) If Bitcoin is widely adopted and stays independent of any standard currency then there is a transfer of savings from the national currency to BTC that results in a net loss of wealth due to deflationary pressure.

Sure thing, as long as you don't use the evil spooky fiat USD for any transactions.

It doesn't, look at Japan. Deflation is a death spiral.
