The speculation is going up because people who don't understand or care about the technology only see it as a get rich scheme. Also I mainly follow Kraken but what I see is the price moving around because people buy 0.1-0,5 BTC. Sometimes you see a larger buy in but most of the time it is just small amounts going in. Someone buys 0.3 BTC the price jumps 2-3 EUR per BTC and the almighty market cap goes up immediately several million USD... just because someone bought 0.3 BTC... This fuels the get rich mentality..... rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:34:46
Don't you know that BTC is a get rich scheme? Why did you sell it? Just hodl!!!
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:30:45
It isn't a bubble,  people are getting informed,  understand the background of the technology, reading the white paper, running nodes and then buying BTC.. no speculation or get rich quick scheme to see here.

You don't want that, if BTC reaches those values it is because everything else collapsed.... economy, stock markets, resources, electricity, governments.... welcome to Mad Max.

Very good point, were we part is that I think that these 0.1 BTC buy ins are investment because the mantra is that BTC will go to the message mooon.

How did you manage to sell that amount of BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:23:18
I do not agree, that is exactly the problem... no one is buying anything with BTC (exageration) it is only money going in. If people were buying multiple houses without the intent of living in them but just for the price surge what would you say then?
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:56:34
That is why I say that the BTC speculation is hurting BTC:
-It is putting BTC in the radar of the regulators
-It is demotivating BTC adoption as a payment tool
But at least the Hoardesr are happy
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:58:25
You are wrong, the agenda is written by horders that bought in early in BTC,  hundreds of USD. For them there is no problem if it falls a lot. They just need to keep the "fresh meet" from selling. It is easy to Hodl when you have a large buffer. If they had bought a &gt;2k there would be a different story. That is why the narrative is not about adoption of BTC as a payment tool but as a get rich scheme to get to the moooooon! This is the greatest treath to BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:35:31

@_date: 2017-07-24 07:28:14
That is why people want only to discuss market cap since it gives the illusion of astronomical growth. I bet you the the market swings that we have seen of billions of USD in market cap are not even millions. 
And no, you don't get to say that that is the way the stock market works because companies have collateral. 
This looks more and more as a Ponzi. No problem as long every one is buying.
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:24:29
Agreed the type of "user" being recruited by the price train is unsophisticated and clueless about the technology and it's power. Their "long term view" view is a get rich scheme to the moon, they do not care about BTC adoption. BTC has been high jacked.

@_date: 2017-07-15 10:40:51
The market cap is an illusion. If it only reflects the price of the last sold BTC multiplied by all the BTC. If a cryptocurrency had the first one million coins sold at 1USD and the next coin sold at 1000USD (thousand USD) total money in would be 1'001'000.00USD (one million and one thousand USD) but the market cap would be one billion.....  Then all the people that had bought the coins at 1USD will not give a s*** about adoption but will protect the market cap... driving ignorant investors to buy to the moooooon!

Thanks for the feedback, this is the type of discussion we should be having. I agree that the Fed is audited, the problem of this "bill" is that it is not really about auditing the Fed but gaining control/influence by the government. Having said that there is a lack of transparency in the Fed audit process.
I belive that the tightening of the money policy will put the market today in a bearish mode, as it happened in China. The problem is that I believe we are long overdue to a market correction (every 7 years on average there is one) and the problems from 2008 are still there. And yes the notepad was yellow. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:31:35

I would even respect an honest position of "I am only here for the money, f*** BTC, f*** the noobs and f*** adoption of a new payment system." I understand... your "safe" ticket to riches is being dragged down and you are scared...
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:50:35
Consumer adoption will be severely affected by it. The normal person is already not very confortable with BTC. Instability and forks will make people more reluctant. The price drop will also scare users.
What you need to understand is that this applies fot the target audience, the users that will uee BTC as it was intended... as a payment method. So this will affect adoption.
The problem is that BTC has been high jacked by speculators and horders that are using BTC as a get rich scheme and for them the fork is even better. Spéculative gambling is the same as adoption.

I remember having groups of people installing n the "noobs" smartphone a wallet and sending them fractions of a BTC, then asking the audience to send BTC back an forward between them... it was about the technology and the freedom.... this is not what the community stands for now. The "Buy Bitcoin Guy" got 0 support from the community.... The mob is taking over... they will kill adoption if it means lower prices. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:51:06
Very good point, I will make note of it. My concern is that this will bring unwanted attention from big banks and regulators. They can kick BTC to the curb before it becomes resilient.  We should be trying to fly under the radar. When the next banking crisis comes we will not be strong enough and will buckle. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:27:09
The problem was that each month the value dod not crash they had to keep paying the derivative, the problem is that the market can be irrational longer than you can keep liquid. Also housing was consider to be a safe bet so the premium was low.

Let me tell you a secret that will keep you awake at night; the noobs are mostly bying under 1 BTC... Sometimes only a couple hundreds USD (as BTC was intended for)... When this falls apart they will lose a couple of BTC (that is all they can afford) you guys will lose hundreds... and this is the only reference to FUD in all this post.... The FUD you were so desperately searching for.... "there is a storm coming Mr Wayne"
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:27:18
No one in in this conversation is instilling fear saying bad things about BTC in fact we want stronger adoption for it. What are you referring to when you say FUD? Here you have an honest discussion of ideas an values for the BTC community. Where is the FUD, or is this your Pavlovic response when a post is not about encouraging noobs to buy or HODL?

@_date: 2017-07-16 11:27:13
The problem is that now most  everyday Joe  is part of the problem, he is buying his few hundred dollars not to use BTC but just to hoard. The normal Joe will not use BTC except as a get rich scheme. How will we get adoption, that is why everyone freaks out when the price drops, it is only about the price. The same thing for the Hodl'ers, the difference is that they bought at a hundreds USD price so as long as the price does not fall bellow that they are proudly being the mouth pieces for holding. They are pushing their agenda and getting noobs without any understanding of what they are getting into on the front lines. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:30:20
This is the danger, those people will either sell their losses and it is bad for the community, they will remember they got burned. Or they will kept the BTC and push for new "fresh meat" to pump up the price inthe next rally to cover their losses.
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:05:59
Bitcoin is very important for us but small fish for them. They prefer having everyone talking about Bitcoin either than talking about the message that the Fed does not want to be audited, that it is going to disinvest and it will tighten monetary policy.... The same approach that the China tried in the beguining of this year but had to abandon: 
What is your opinon on auditing the Fed? Do you think this will have an impact in the economy and the stock market? Will we have to go the way of China in a few months? What was the color of the pad that the guy used to photo bomb?...
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:58:19
BTC nowadays is mainly a speculative tool.... it has been high jacked... and it will destroy it at the end.... That is the whole problem.... let me give a scenario;  Satoshi has some wallets with millions of bitcoins. The reason people say he is dead is because there was never a transaction out of them. If satoshi would move just 1 BTC.... the market cap would crash. Everyone would know that if he wants he could flood the market and drown the speculators... Then BTC would really be about adoption.

They are the ones that will bring BTC down, their message is not let is use this as a payment method but as a get rich scheme.

This is why it is important to distract people:
The Fed this summer announced its plans to trim its balance sheet by reducing the reinvestment of maturing securities in its portfolio through a series of gradually rising caps. For Treasuries, the cap will start at $6bn a month, and increase in steps of $6bn at three-month intervals over the next year until it reaches $30bn a month. For mortgage-backed securities, the cap will start at $4bn a month and increase in steps of $4bn at three-month intervals the same period until they reach $20bn a month.
How far the Fed goes is a vital question for markets. And the potential effect on markets was oddly little discussed at this week’s conference. But the spectre of the 2013 “taper tantrum” — when markets were thrown into turmoil by the Fed indicating that it was planning to scale back its bond-buying programme — loomed large over the discussion, even if it was rarely mentioned. “It wasn’t omitted consciously, but because everyone at the conference seemed to have bought into the idea that markets are going to react well to it,” says Seth Carpenter, chief US economist at UBS, who was at the conference. “But if they think that the lack of any reaction so far means they can do whatever they want, then they would be well advised to be cautious.”Indeed, concerns over the potential impact are far starker in the finance industry than they were in the Benjamin Strong meeting room. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned this week that the unwinding of central bank balance sheets could be a choppy affair. “We’ve never have had QE like this before, we’ve never had unwinding like this before,” Mr Dimon told at a conference in Paris, according to Bloomberg. “When that happens of size or substance, it could be a little more disruptive than people think . . . We act like we know exactly how it’s going to happen and we don’t.”

I agree, you need to buy it in order to move it around, exchange for products, entice business and even get payed in BTC. The problem is that hoarders are just buying it to keep BTC in their wallets and wait for the mooooooooon! The mail message in BTC is not adoption but a get rich scheme....

Dear Chad, thank you for making a very valid point. What is important to understand is if there is another economic crash,  BTC will be useful for a couple of weeks at the most, banking and asset controls will be put in place, exchanges will be ordered to seize and assist. The momentum of BTC will not be there (it is not seen as payment tool) to prevent it from being shut down. Imagine a Ciprus like event but at an US level. This BTC bubble is just putting us on the radar because of the size of the market cap not because of the wide implementation. What do you think?
