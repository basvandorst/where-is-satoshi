The number one reason why Bitcoin is great for merchants -** NO CHARGEBACKS!**
Credit cards are the most scammy and fraud-ridden forms of payment in the world. Credit cards are a nightmare for online merchants. Almost a necessary evil because everyone uses them. The fees and process of fighting chargebacks is insane.
Bitcoin is the easiest and fastest way to accept payments online. 
We actually prefer Bitcoin transactions over all other payment forms at our online precious metals site  for all of the reasons mentioned here.

The overly happy bald guy is probably making millions.
On another note, it is good to see a legit company pop up in the Bitcoin space. You can actually put a face and people to the company. Half the people in the BTC space are anonymous people and you can't even identify where they are located half the time. Good to see people showing their faces.
Regarding the website, it does need a makeover. I agree with that. However, I think they need to work on their API for Magento as well. I can't get it to work.

I only considered the Casascius physical coins to be for novelty purposes. I thought it was just cool to have a physical coin laying around. Didn't realized people used them for security or to detect prior transactions. Not surprised these guys compromised the Casascius. 
Nothing beats a cheap USB drive, TrueCrypt, and a few minutes of time.

There are many things you can use bitcoin for:
Buying goods and services.
There are many things that you can NOT do with bitcoin:
Paying any government dues (taxes, parking tickets, etc).
Most economies need multiple forms of currency. Usually one for of currency is not suitable for all transactions. This is why people use a combo of fiat, electronic money, gold and silver bullion depending on their objectives.

I agree with your point. Both parties need some protection.  Chargebacks are not good for legit merchants. I am looking at this from the standpoint of a legit merchant.

It's called arbitrage. Long story short, it doesn't work in practice as well as it does in theory. Due to the length of time for transactions to settle, it is not a very reliable strategy. Not to mention prices on Mt. Gox are a joke. Nobody is exchanging USD at Mt Gox rates.

A good precursor would be learning some basic computer security. Then [head over to wiki for a quick rundown on bitcoin.]( If you are still interested, there are lots of forums, discussion boards, merchants and blogs about Bitcoin to choose from.

Agreed. Who writes this stuff? Probably a script...
