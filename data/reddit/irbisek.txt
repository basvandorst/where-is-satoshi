Too bad speculation on human misery and death is more profitable. No, really, remember Arab Spring? It was partially started by funds jumping on food futures causing prices to spike and the dissent to flame into open rebelion. These people being gunned down in Yemen and Bahrain by Saudi forces? Crawling civil war in Libya? *Real* civil war in Syria? You can thank stolen money sloshing in Tax Havens for 90% of that.
I am not saying traders are bad, but when they turn from trading to pure 100% speculation and market manipulation they become entirely negative force in economy. Just look up recent LIBOR manipulation, who benefited besides handful of scum that should have ended up in jail?

That maybe was the case 30 years ago and earlier. Today, fund artificially drives price of commodity, say food, just before it is produced to pay pennies for it, then drives price up to fleece customers, then dumps the profit into LIBOR manipulation, with a side of tax haven money laundering to avoid paying pesky taxes on profits, then fires your bottom rung trader who kept taking drugs whole last year to keep with pressure and 12 hour workdays, taking in new naive idiot being paid peanuts fresh from university instead.
Your old time, honest traders with scruples are either sadly a thing of the past or too small scale to count in modern world.

Yup, Windows actually works and is proven.

I like how you are unable to even read 3 sentences you pasted with comprehension.
