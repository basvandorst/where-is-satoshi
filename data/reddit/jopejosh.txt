Lol, beats me.  I just know that it was insanely non-intuitive to me when I started working with the numbers.  Just goes to show that our intuitions are often misleading.

He has predicted 99 of the last 3 crashes.

So, you're saying it's an investment in others' greed?  I'll take that bet!

Why not hold 50% and take 50% to convert to traditional investments?  
It depends on his financial situation, but a one-time $75k investment into VFIAX or VTSAX could be nearly $1M in 30 years and with a little luck, his remaining bitcoin investment will continue to grow much faster than that.

It sells as the market price, then you have a liability for capital gains on the difference between your cost basis and the market rate.
This is super complicated because you can select different methods of calculating your gain.  Generally if you have had the coins for more than one year, it makes sense to use FIFO so you can pay the lower gains rate, but it's a really good idea to model this in  or  to figure out which treatment is best for your situation.

The answer is 42%.  A 30% dip requires a 42% gain to recover from.
Intriguingly, if you've had a run-up of 30% then saw a dip of 30%, you would still have 91% of your original capital, which would in turn only require a 9.9% gain to recover from.
Volatility is tricky.  The numbers can seem bigger or smaller depending on your psychological state.

If it can be attacked so easily, it isn’t usable.  I’d rather have a volatile scrum of coins over one coin where some committee controls who gets what.
I think it is usable and that continued adoption will increase the market sizes so that the coins become distinguishable and trade more independently.

May not have been successful as of yet, but scam is erroneous.  It's a great device for devs to build upon.  Serves an interesting albeit (so far) small niche.  I'm not sure if their current status is, but in five years we'll probably see them as ahead of their time.

My memory of it is that it made hard things easy.
For example, if you want to build an API gateway to micro-payments service for Bitcoin, that's a pretty hard problem even today.  You would face substantial obstacles in terms of transactional volume and fees.  Since the 21.co device trivializes off-chain transactions, this becomes a 20-minute tutorial exercise.  Very powerful!
From my perspective, it is a fair miner attached to a damn good programming stack.  Almost like adding the programmability of ETH to Bitcoin, but instead of baking it into the protocol, they used an additional layer of hardware / software to help it along.

Beats me, ask them directly if you're curious.  I had one of the devices and it made working with the blockchain delightful.  Never really did anything spectacular with it, but liked the device nonetheless.

IRA or 401K is a type of retirement account, there's no reason that you can't hold cryptocurrencies in one of them.  It's rare enough that you'll probably have to explain it to them, but a self-directed IRA custodian should be able to do the deal.

A better comparison would be to see what the increase in gold market cap was, then apply a percentage of it to the crypto markets.
Every .1% market cap stolen from gold is a $100B increase in crypto market cap.  With today’s crypto market cap of $109B, that would represent a doubling of crypto asset prices.  This is the asymmetry of an adoption curve.
Is it plausible that people and institutions would like to have a portfolio that consists of 5% gold and 0.5% cryptocurrency?  Could that portfolio allocation increase from 0.5% to 2-5%?  Perhaps...
