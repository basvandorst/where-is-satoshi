Agreed. Looking for this level too.

Inevitably for when the gov comes for your taxes I'm afraid

If Bitfinex / Tether are engaged in fraud as some reports suggest (not saying they are!), what scale of collapse in Bitcoin values do you think could occur off the back of that as a scandal?

Probably market manipulation by a whale. Buy a lot all at once, get everyone excited and sell it back into the market as it continues on the added euphoria. Quick profit. Repeat. 
This is such a bubble. Be careful guys.

Having second thoughts, oh god this is nerve-racking... Help? Flipping back and forth. Between the decision...

Just been doing some reading on the psychology of bubbles and this got me worried:  - it seriously looks like we might be at the second peak now in the cycle. Im prob going to cash in 50%, guess i may be wrong, but better to be safe right?

Problem is I only just bought the dip so if the price drops like this article has got me worried it might then I'm stuffed. And I've invested a fair amount. Should have researched before lol. Arghh decisions!

Not sure I agree if they end up with roughly the same amount of coins at the end. I think they are going to periodically dump throughout the evening, wait for media to pick it up and then keep pushing it down to the 4-digits as more sellers panic. Just a guess though,

Doesn't this power they have really undermine the credibility of bitcoin. Well at least it will engender a feeling of distrust in the value of bitcoin. At least government can, generally, be held accountable so cannot pull crap like this. 
What are people's thoughts? 
Are there other coins that do no centralize power like this in the hand of the whales?

Everywhere on this sub over the last 10 days or so, I hear people talking about 'buy the dip'. Sure there is a lot of volatility right now, but in percentage terms it is not so great, compared to what it might be. Why not save funds for when there is a more serious drop eg. to 5000-6000, rather than buying at eg. 10,800. The long-term prospect appears decent, but that is long term. Surely I would be better to wait to see what happens over the next few weeks before getting in, as there is a lot of talk about a correction right now after the recent hype spike. Thoughts? Thanks!

But you can also short with futures...

I personally wouldn't borrow or leverage on bitcoin. Far too risky. 2 years is a long time to have to spend to pay back a debt from a bad bet. Just play with what you can afford. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:31:34
1) How do you think the futures market opening will impact the price? I'm thinking there is a distinct possibility for downward pressure due to the increase in ability for large-scale shorting. 
2) Do you think other cryptos will increase in value relative to Bitcoin, as they are less mainstream and less exposed to shorting?
Thanks.

This is what got me thinking:  Looks like the second peak now. Out now (and de-stressed!) but fascinated to see how this plays out. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:46:23
I think is is the 18th.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:45:50
Thanks, but I guess I'm worried about the 'pros'. It might be better to not buy at the moment and wait for an opportunity they create, but I'm pretty uncertain about this.

‘Since most investors believe the price will go up...’ - this is where your argument is weakened. It should read ‘since most hodlers and speculators hope the price will go up’. I think the professionals might have a different idea.

Why do you mind if you have a five year view then?

What is the preferred set up for someone buying Bitcoin in UK? Currently trading through IG, but this is not owning the asset, and the spreads are wide(!). 
Looking to get into long-term ownership to layer on top of day-trading. I am predicting a decent correction in the next few days / weeks (see my other question below to respond to that), but the long-term picture seems strong. I would not buy now, but want to have a set up ready for this correction to take advantage. 
NB. Just in case you didn't know, it is possible to go short on IG should you wish.

What is Tether? 
I've heard some reports of odd activity relating to Tether and it may present a systematic risk to Bitcoin. 
Is there anything to that?
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:29:00
Gonna SELL. I'm probably a pussy but it looks like the price is on a move down now. It wasn't making any progress at all for the last hour. I'm just too worried. Good luck if you go for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:47:17
That's what I did last time. Now I've put the sell order in I'm just not in a world of anxiety anymore. I need to be made of sterner stuff but I'm too worried that there are too many noobs like me who are gonna bail...
