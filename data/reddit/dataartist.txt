Yet you still measure the value of Bitcoin in terms of fiat and you have never actually bought anything with Bitcoin

I’m not saying you have to express bitcoin’s value in fiat terms - I’m saying most people do express the value of bitcoin in dollars. These are the same “investors” who never have and probably never will even use bitcoin as a transaction medium. That makes it a pyramid scheme.

If you are expressing the value of a currency like Bitcoin solely in terms of another currency like the dollar, then it is nothing more than a pyramid scheme.

Ok - fine. Pyramid scheme is not an appropriate name for it. Investment scam might be better. I do understand bitcoin and the unrealized hype over its ability to become some sort of replacement currency. The promise of Ethereum and smart contracts never has seemed to have materialized into anything meaningful other than Crypto kittens. I just keep hearing everyone talk about how this technology is going to take over the world, but it just seems like a bunch of hype by people who only want to eventually sell the bitcoin they have for US dollars.

No - it doesn’t. Just because our currency is not backed by gold does not mean it is worthless. It is backed by faith in our country and our ability to defend it with a huge arsenal of weapons and the best military on the planet. Anyone who doesn’t agree and thinks that fiat is worthless - I will email you my address and you can send all of your “worthless” money to me, ok??
