Is your account fully verified?
I've purchased under $50 3 times, the last time was yesterday.

See how well it turned out for them...
(down until the noobie admin figures out how they were "hacked")
offering 50btc to anyone with tips..LMAO
Sounds like a crime stoppers call..

That's what I was thinking, why would anyone "buy porn"..lol

I sent some cash to zipzap yesterday and had btcs about 20 mins later. I used a payday load place to do it, they found all my info with the code bitinstant gave me.

I'm glad I'm not the only one that read it like that

We've ran into issues giving out leftovers like this. You run into liability issues, if they got sick from the food you gave out, they "could" sue. It sucks but it's the safe route.
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:23:40
crap food..
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:41:22
ah maybe, I've never tried to get less then .1
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:40:28
I'll give it a try
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:07:39
Yup, that site is trash.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:47:32
Exactly, best buy can suck it
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:04:41
this would be wonderful!
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:18:53
Just a question.. How many forums had you ran before bitcointalk?
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:22:32
watch out, talk like that will bring on the downvotes..lol
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:02:32
Good luck everyone, I have no idea where I would start, but you get a vote from me.
@_date: 2013-07-27 23:24:35
Awesome, keep dropping!! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:02
Are you positive on that?
I've made purchases &amp; got my original price.
In fact I picked up a little last week at 4 something. Guess I'll see in another day or two..

noobie admin

I've always wondered why they're on a free forum script. Get a paid version like xenforo for more security and modern code.
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:15:42
How much are you spending though? If it takes 10k to make 10k..
Either way I'm jealous of all those cards..lol
@_date: 2013-10-03 15:21:52


50BTC to tell you how it was done?
Why not spend 1.4 btc and get a real forum script ;)


you must be new... if not, you're acting like you are

@_date: 2013-05-18 21:48:27
Have you actually searched for a case, or do you mean you haven't seen one today..lol
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:27:26
I hope he hires a real sys-admin to watch the forums.
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:22:28
Is there an Android version?
