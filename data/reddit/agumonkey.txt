I've read a few accounts of people being immensely "skilled" in c++ but who would die before the project finishes because they thought in c++. Meanwhile some people would switch to other languages, python, ocaml, fsharp, erlang and would be able to prototype, get new ideas and find nicer solutions faster.

@_date: 2019-10-10 17:10:45
Exactly, this was an important assesment about the overall trend, the 10k dip was questionning a lot of things, this 4% calms things down.

What would make price go down that much ?

Self trivia: I was in a deep drag last year; a HS buddy started asking me about bitcoin and for a reason I decided to buy. 20$ (lel). I gradually increased. Lost 50% (thanks Jan) and decided to stop it all. Of course I didn't, but I didn't increase capital. I decided to scalp semi smart. Made a good run to recover 20%. Then stupidity took them away. then the 8k drop happened.. I couldn't resist to try more leverage now that I knew more. So here I am, still monitoring graphs.. which is dead stupid, but all excited by the pseudo-gambling of coins.. and instead of doing nothing, I take advantage of the excitement to work out a little while waiting for tipping points. I started programming a bot (2% done though), learned to fix electronics and read a book about swing trading, while going into quant.
This soulless addiction made me 200% more lively...

We're all betting on our own. I won't blame you. You could have been lucky and I'd be jealous right now.
tiny personal story: I find the bitcoin crowd crazy (taught me a lot about human nature, including my own psychology), I find trading dull and soulless. But it did make me proactive in twisted ways. It made me take risks. Taught me not to act in hurries, to think longer term etc.. Though stupid losses made me angry positively and woke me up in other domains. So I can understand your point of view. There's something interesting about the risk taking lessons here.

@_date: 2019-09-26 07:39:37
You want my fills ?
Did I say I'm rich btw ? no. I just said patience and discipline wins, that's all. Why ? because I was a newb (and still am by a large margin), I got over optimistic, over-reacted.. and lost very rapidly. After a while you just learn from your mistakes.. and when similar situations occur.. you just remember you fail before and you try to use your cold logical side instead of your superstitious immature side. Don't over estimate risks, don't panic, try not to be too greedy and accept a tiny profit instead of leaving something open in the hope you'll maximize it .. and lose either money or time (hodl) if suddenly the market flips. Also, start small so you can play relaxed. I only do daily scrap, people I talk to online know exactly what I do; and it's ridiculous compared to many, I'm only trading in the hundreds for 1% net profits. With all the innefficiencies, I turned 150e into 200e in something like two monthes. Minuscule amount so far but that 15% per month, way more than my bank interests even after taxes. With ramping up and hopefully a few improvements in my discipline (as I said I still act greedy and end up losing profits) I may reach better ratios. Also my exchange changed its fees, taking a third of what I did before. 
I'm not aiming for winning 100K overnight, just trying to make a regular semi passive income from that to fund a business.

Some say this dip is just returning to the historical growth rate and that after a while between 6 and 8k we might see another cycle of peak above 14k.
In my pessimist theories btc next peak will be 10k forming a long term lowering triangle.
