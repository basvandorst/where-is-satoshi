Get this comment to the top boys. We need everyone to know.

If you know he or she will walk eventually, why not bet on it early?

What makes you say that?

A device like the Ledger Nano that can store private keys offline.

Good one. I’ll save that for next time

I would just say that don’t believe people that think they can time the market. We’re in this for the long term, regardless of short term price volatility. Also, whenever you do buy, get your coins onto a cold wallet as soon as possible. Good luck to you.

It’s very reassuring to know that there are other people like you out there that understand the severity of what cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, are doing to the world. Thanks for the comment.

Still happens to me now. I ask people if they’ve heard of Bitcoin and actually know what it is? And of course, they ALWAYS do. I ask them to explain and they stumble on their words, making sure to throw in “cryptocurrency” and “drug dealers” at some point. No one knows shit.

Buddy, you must have bought all your bitcoin at $9000 if you think a 10% correction means the price crashed.

Thanks I’ll definitely check that out

That’s okay. Nothing wrong with buying high right now. It’s all just rounding errors in the next decade of exponential growth.

No they want you to sell it. They want to buy it for themselves instead of let you buy it.

Here we go ��
Edit: I knew y’all lurkers were waiting for someone to say it
