25k by NYE. It’s the big Christmas sale!

Does your mum know you're trolling on Reddit?

Ah yeah I thought that it was back open. I know about the Coinbase scam

It's good. I've only been using a few days but it's very easy. The only thing it doesn't have is a nett position (profit / loss) for each coin so I keep a spreadsheet of those instead. 
If you do use it is recommend going onto r/binance and using one of the referral code that the people there post. Give a little something back

Coordinated attack. It happens in the stock market too

Ah sorry it wasn’t directly aimed at you it was more of a general comment to those panicking right now. A lot of people are just seeing the end of the world.

Man you lot need to chill the fuck out. Things go up and down. It happens. If you can’t stand it just keep dollars / pounds under your mattress and watch it rot. 
Loads of coins are down today. Would now be the right time to crack out the Buffet saying of ‘being greedy when others are fearful’?

Is there a reason GDAX is saying the last BCH trade was $9.5k? Looks highly spurious 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:54:43
Things don't go up in straight lines. The entire history of anything that is traded tells us this.

Don’t think he’s wrong. It’ll be driven down further though until whoever is doing it wants to flip it back

Everybody is playing directly into Wall Street hands. The guys will be reading these threads laughing their heads off at the panic going on. Crypto is clearly the Wall Street dream. It appears to be incredibly easy to manipulate the price and I honestly think that’s what’s going on. I’ve seen it time and time again on AIM (uk junior stock market). 
My view is it’s an engineered drop and there’s way too many inexperienced people with too much invested who are panic selling. That further adds to the drop.
