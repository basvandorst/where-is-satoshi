Yea like I said, it doesn't matter. 
What you linked is means something different. It says that the higher volume you trade (leverage or not leveraged doesn't even matter), the more a pip/tick is going to be worth. Well duh.
Since the main forex transaction costs arise from the bid/ask spread (depending on your broker, but used here as convienience as catch-all transaction costs), of course the $ value of the spread is going to go up with more lots used.
Why doesn't this have to do anything with what we are discussing here? Because we are talking about the hard-coded limits by the exchange, mainly the trading fees, and they have a direct impact on the spread (ask-bid) size. 
Actually what you linked is even worse than I thought. It's irrelevant. Completely. Sorry.

If you want to play along. The meaty bits are in lag_it(), you can play around with the variables.

Why do you care, he's got good opinions. It's stupid of him to think that he had anything to do with stopping the bubble, but let him be. His blog is pretty fun 2 read.

I find the whole idea for the foundation pretty silly.

Ugh, no there are lots of reports of mtgox accounts being frozen, apparently at the whim of the admins.

The arbitrage argument doesn't hold because of the huge delays and risks associated with transferring fiat between the exchanges.  Serious arbitrage would take lots of capital and big risks (exchanges going bust, blocking accounts etc).
I agree, EUR/USD is way bigger than bitcoin (biggest market in the world probably), but this isn't just about the market size but also the daily traded volume. 
Daily volume and general activity ties closely together with how expensive it is to trade.

Too bad it had to close down, was my favorite exchange.

They can't do anything about it. They have known about it for way too long and haven't done anything because it would require a serious overhaul of their engine.
