Trade volume to visitors ratio can help to detect exchanges with fake volume. For example, it's interesting to compare Bitforex ($84 527 per visitor) and Binance ($740 per visitor). I'll be happy to know your thoughts.
Also you can advise me exchanges which we must to add first of all.

Hi friends!
If someone needs real-time tracker for new listings I built it. Over 30 major exchanges, e-mail, telegram and browser push alerts. Easy and free. You will be receiving short messages like "Kucoin lists SHL" after the trade begins. It's the part of Bitgur Alerting Service.

You will find this chart on Global Charts page: 
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:36:47
Colour shows share of exchange. It's better to see interactive chart here  . 
GDAX is 15th for number of deals and 6th for Bitcoin trade volume.  
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:36:51
Maybe I can't understand your question? We collect data directly from exchanges API and then calculate many of our market metrics.

Kraken has large deal average volume and low number of deals. So it didn't hit the top 15 by deals per day.

The green or red color chart depends on the timeframe of a chart.
