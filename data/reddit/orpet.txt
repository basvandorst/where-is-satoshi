I'm not overly knowledgeable about the best range to murder people at with various weapons, I looked up the effective range of an AK-47 on wiki, I'm just guessing it's a lot easier to kill people with guns than with katanas or cars. I'm actually pretty much on the fence when it comes to gun control, the OP has a point that if you want to kill someone you can find a way to, it's just a retarded category error to say guns are like cars and swords. Did you know you can kill someone with a paint ball gun if you shoot them in the eye, I guess maniacs choose to buy them to, even though it;s a billion times easier to kill someone with an AK-47.

Ok do it on a log scale then. 
Anyway, "Intent to Manipulate" is a tautology, you can not intend to do something without trying to manipulate something; if you make anything, a graph or otherwise, that you intend to be seen by other people then you will manipulate (change) there perception, even if a quantification of there change in perception would only be one pixel high. The idea that informing someone is not the same as manipulating them only makes sense if you are lying to them and an accurate graph is not a lie, so wtf?
Edit: I am trying to manipulate you into agreeing with my point of view using a rational argument that I believe to be based in fact. Sorry if that causes you emotional distress.

Do you think it's bad analogy? I'm starting to think it is.

What I was trying to put across is a graph with multiple lines on it for different currencies/ commodities etc. So the line for bitcoin would be very near the bottom as the market cap is so small compared to other things who's lines are higher up as their market cap is a lot higher.
Have you never seen a line graph with multiple lines on it?
This would show volatility as a comparison between different things. I'm sure the total market cap change for bitcoin is less on average in a given time period than most other things. I just wanted something that would show this and prove it empirically.

Bit of a push but we transmit blocks using electricity over the internet, electricity is made of electrons, electrons have mass, according to general and special relativity mass bends space and time?

“Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.” Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), founder of the House of Rothschild.
In my opinion the power to issue money, one that is enjoyed and heavily employed by the central banks, is one of the rawest and greatest forms of control that can be possessed. Bitcoin may give that power back to the masses. At the very least Bitcoin is helping to educate people about this aspect of money, and knowledge of this kind is very important if we are to progress, at least in my opinion.

just did 20 seconds of research on google and found there was a 8% drop last april in one day. That is crazy. Anyway my point was that you can'r compare Bitcoin to other things because other things are much older.

That's simply not true. I think you must be reading the price wrong or getting false market data somehow. Can anyone collaborate this outrageous claim?

Just think about how many people you could kill with a car or a Katana from 400 meters away, then stop making awful analogies.

Yep this as well. It's both ridiculous on time scale and market cap.

I see. It'd be nice to have some sort of graph with time on the X and market cap change on the Y for the last 5 years and lines for different commodities/currencies/stocks + Bitcoin. I'm guessing Bitcoin would have barely any visible change at the bottom of the chart compared to everything else.

Cool I actually own an air rifle, I'm going to try this.
