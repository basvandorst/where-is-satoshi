How would I tip a user? Do I do it from my current wallet? I'm using multibit.

Aaaah! 
Wait, Karma is worth something?
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:40:39
What would the negative be to just doing it now?
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:38:17
Because more Karma = more pennies?

You lie :(

Is your wallet address something to keep private? I wouldn't think so, as it's how you receive payments, but still curious.

I am in the states currently!

Holy bugger! I do! 
I'm slow at this. Thank you for your patience.

This is why I asked reddit. Appreciate it!

I'm starting to gather that hacking is a serious issue with bitcoin?

Actually, question for you- I noticed that I don't have a logon for my wallet. What if I download the wallet on a different computer...? Is the wallet portable somehow that I'm just missing?

So I tried it, actually going from Mac to PC, and I have one follow up question--
It appears it worked, I typed in the password I set up for the key, and it synced the accounts, but did not pop up my old wallet onto my new computer. Did it just transfer (synchronize) the zero BC I had in the new computer's wallet?

Truly thank you for helping. It's an interesting concept to wrap my head around!

I suppose I'll just sit here with my 0.00000000BTC and wait until there's a more reliable way to purchase. From what I've researched I figured a bit of what you said to be true. Damnit.
