People don't stop spending on necessities, just frivolous things. I'd rather have a stable economy based on necessity and backed by savers rather than this bubbly one depended on mass consumption and runaway debt.

Maybe because the big six banks in Canada share an oligopoly on the distribution of money. This affords them incredible power and influence over the population. Bitcoin is a threat to this.

This thread is infested with trolls. I've used them for months trading coins. It's been nothing but good for me. Don't trade much now, just stacking.  As a Canuck, their debit deposit option is the best/easiest I've used. I recommend them.

You're right; no currency is backed, and greed and lack of discipline has made it a race to the bottom. That is the inherent flaw of fiat currencies and my point: I believe all governments are too corruptible to control the issuance and value of a currency. Therefore, my solution is bitcoin. And there is plenty of bitcoin to serve that purpose -- it will naturally rise in value as demand increases.

I would think that if the Belarus ruble was backed by gold, USD, bitcoin or some other valuable commodity, this would not be happening to the people. For whatever reason, the government has enabled this situation and it is inexcusable. A good lesson for all of us.

But what's stopping those assholes from selling a ton of paper BTC certificates?

What you have to do when living in a debt-driven, consumption based economy. Stop spending and she grinds to a halt. It's a rat race.

Sorry, I have no sympathy for a soulless corporation that uses the corrupt monetary system to gouge the poor and unbanked. I think this sub has shown class with the satire. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 10:58:35
Glad I made you laugh. But it doesn't change the fact that WU sustains its flawed and predatory business model in absence of competition, and that bitcoin is credible competition. Why else would they send out the lawyers? This sub is humorously mocking their ridiculous marketing efforts.

Obviously the most unlikely scenario involving a complete collapse of government/authority. It's not a good argument for bitcoin, either. In such an event, basics become priceless.

There's also Cryptsy, who accept Interac deposits via Debit way with no fee, for now. It's quick and easy to verify and you can buy BTC and many alt coins.

Currently, Dogecoin's rate of inflation far exceeds its increase of users. As a pragmatic CC investor, I don't see a future there. At some point the community must get serious about capping, securing and promoting commerce or it will die. Just my 2 bits worth.

Mining exploded because of the unlimited and cheap fiat paper borrowing. If miners had to build from only bitcoin investments, the situation would be much different , I believe.

Either that, or Cortana is harvesting data from your internet history.

I don't know what's going through that man's mind but he looks sad and desperate. I cannot so easily judge him.
From experience, I know many people who are kind, considerate, and hard working, just trying to make their way through life. They wouldn't knowingly put anyone out, especially their children. Not many understand the complexities of banking and politics and implicitly trust the government and financial leaders to make the proper decisions on their behalf. A bit naive perhaps, but understandable when you realize that from birth to grave they've been programmed to trust authority and not challenge system. And when it breaks down, they are distraught and lost much like this man in the picture. It does not make them bad people unworthy of pity.

When you grow up, you'll realize the world is not black and white, and that it is human compassion, understanding, and forgiveness that will save our civilization, not the intolerance you display. Even if this man was wilfully blind to truth and as self-serving as you assume, he does not deserve to starve at the alter of austerity. A little compassion will carry you far in life.

And they say bitcoin is volatile.

If you are making life decisions based on groupthink, I don't think  bitcoin can help you.
@_date: 2015-03-29 15:50:15
I would say you are a fool to depend on the profits of a product that is so easily reproducible, and to rely on a violent higher  authority to enforce your rules.
I think iTunes has shown us that digital content can be successfully monetized. Same with Google that offers software and services for free to bolster their core business. 
The internet has changed everything, therefore content creators need to change with the times and not depend on governments to preserve dying business models. They have better things to do.

The general population will switch to bitcoin when it is more advantageous for them to do so.

1. No. I'm not so ideologically bound. 
2. Practically speaking, we can't fairly enforce IP or copyright laws, therefore they wouldn't exist in my world.

I'm thinking it would allow independent delivery people to operate more on your own terms. For some, it may be the only option for such employment. ideologically, it would lessen the grip big companies have on the market. For customers, it's simply another choice, one that may offer better price/service, privacy/anonymity. And, compared to say UPS, I would think it would remove layers of complexity, being a decentralized autonomous corporation.

Bitcoin won't help Greece, but not because it's isn't a viable national currency. It is because a corrupt government will always find a way to steal from its citizens.

Yeah, hopefully the judge will accept the validity of your cryptically signed contract stating there was no illegal substances in said package. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:18:47
By then, I predict, bitcoin will be worth so much that people will be competing fiercely for just the transaction fees.
