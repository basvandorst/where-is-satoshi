what about Bitcoin Qt. does that program/application do the same thing?
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:40:55
understandable 100% as that would be very unmanly. anyways, id feel less than a man buying myself such a gift, so i will pass this on to my lady and cross my fingers i get a crate!

yea ill share whatever you guys need, respectfully, my computer shows a higher amount as if the transaction did even happen, but on my phone and on the blockchain site it shows otherwise. am i going crazy here? haha thanks for your help, i really do appreciate it.

as someone trying to learn and understand everything i can about cc, can you tell me what this is? respectfully asking, excuse me if that comes off as a dick question.
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:45:33
okay thanks. i was very curious. i though that each wallet validated each transaction.
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:39:57
i wanted to transfer some BTC to Bitcoin Qt that is on my computer from my coinbase address. so i did. i have heard of stories of people sending to the wrong address (usually last transaction) but what if when typing in the address you put a a single wrong character... and there are 2 outcomes... 1 is that it is an actual wallet and the money goes through or 2 that the money goes to a wallet that does not exist so it cant accept it. am i right? if that is the case, well what happens to the money i am sending to a wallet that does not exist?

crap, so i spent an extra 55$ for beers? how do i make sure this does not happen again, i want the change to drop right back into my same account.
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:39:48
thank you. how do i change that then? i suppose i can see why, but wtf... why haha? i have sent small amounts before to show family how easy it is, but this really sucks. i need to make sure my friends i got hooked on bitcoin to know about this and how to control it properly.
