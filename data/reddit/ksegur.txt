About 150k USD due to the 25 year import law and that’s to go through hell to have it marked as a “show car” and it can still be crushed at the end of the day
So dumb

Thanks for updating me! 
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:52:04
And what did you buy, $100? Lmao. Many people bought in at 16k+ so quit whining
BTW don’t make the scarring mistake I made by clicking on his profile and seeing the dudes dick ��

You’re a stubborn idiot, we’re all trying to help you yet you continue to talk about good faith and things you don’t understand. Go get scammed

0% chance that it’ll go anywhere near $16k in 8 days
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:41:16
3-6 months to break even on 13k? more like 1 week if that
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:19:17
I'll take some, thanks!!!

Let's catch up in May and then we can discuss to see if you're right and wrong, then let's catch up in December to see if you're right or wrong.

And seeing polar opposite comments like this is the reason why i leave it on an exchange secured instead of taking advice from some weirdo on reddit telling me to use some no name Wallets 
I see posts here all the time about people using all these weird sites and they get their money held. 
My coins are staying safe in an exchange. Never had issues with buying or selling either so why change something that’s not broken 
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:31:03
I said I have no issues buying or selling so that should’ve answered your concern 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:10:39
It’s called a dip and ATH was 8k 60 days ago, you’re a moron if you sell out of fear 
I’ll remember to PM you when I cash out and rub it in your amateur face 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:47:12
You can only lose if you decide to sell at a loss so you have full control to ONLY make money if you wait long enough. So don’t invest money you need as you ha e to let it churn

There’s one in Crabtree too (Raleigh NC mall) were a huge tech hub so I’m not surprised

You can buy more when it’s lower to lower your average

This story finally scared me enough to go ahead and purchase a Ledger
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:10:27
Looks like some support at 7k, would be nice if we can all grab at a discount again
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:16:42
It’s going UP, not down
