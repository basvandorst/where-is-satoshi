Welp time to pull out
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:56:00
I didn't daytrade.  I just bought some altcoins and hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:50:08
I did. But thank God I sold it at 17k and bought VEN at $3~.
That VEN purchase price is untouchable and I'm still up 110%.
I must admit I visit here just to see miserable BTC holders still under ATH near 6 weeks later. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:05:54
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:55:20
But why?... VET seems to be much more bullish.  Why wouldn't I hop on a better train only with a 25% loss?
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:05:16
Lol.  
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:44:41
I'm gonna be honest.  I first joined in on the mass mania mid Dec @ 17.6k
I'm glad I got out at 18.5k then into altcoins.  I've enjoyed 600% return since.
If I had held BTC all along... I'd be still in negative after such 40 days...
I already have 600% banked.  I seriously doubt that happening in BTC.  That'd be $87,000 per btc.  Yikes. That sounds crazy unreachable.
I'm typing this not to gloat but you should be honest about yourself.  I'm in it for money.  Most of us are too.  If not you wouldn't be all FUD about every dip and wondering when it'll go up.

I dont get it.  Only coinbase users are affected by IRS?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:53:08
How isn't there a complete and total outrage at Coinbase now at frontpage?
People raged over far less stuff like star wars micro transaction video game.
Coinbase holds our tens of thousands and millions of dollars.
People go to JAIL for this kind of shit if it wasn't regulated.
What's the best Coinbase alternative?  And what's the best exchange?  I'm pulling out all my shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:24
Holy shit.  I just bought bitcoin last week and have been visiting this sub since.
Today it was revealed to me that you guys are fanatics.  You all are insane.  Holy hell- full blown cussing at each other. 
This sub is cancer for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:38:07
I bought bitcoin exactly a week ago at $16,600.
Since then it shot up to 19,800 and now down to same place.  ALL in a week.
We are still at the ATH of one week ago.
Yet y'all are losing your minds.  How you plan on hodling it for many years??
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:49:44
Laughed too much at this
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:18:24
RIP I bought at total ATH ($19700~)
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:54:41
Why not?  I hold both btc and ripple.  I hate blind loyalty.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:30:19
Yet youre freaking out about the dip to ATH few days show does that work
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:05:58
Bcash Shill
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:16:13
You guys are so fickle.  We have a slight dip in last 8 hrs (just before I went to sleep) and y'all are going nuts.
Hodl and forget about it and look at the price again in few mos
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:45:58
Just broke 20k mate 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:47:07
Waiting to bottom out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:27:39
Fuck hodl, I'm buying more at dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:28
This made me LOL for the first time today.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:03:33
78 cents. I'll take it
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:07:47
I hold bitcoin.
I keep seeing these nonsense excuses about holiday break.  I mean, is that our defense mechanism?
Other altcoins are blowing up now during the same holiday season.  How does that work? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:59
Again, that's fine and dandy, but to discard everything negative of Bitcoin as an attack or fake news... that's how dictators rise and take advantage of people.
Bitcoin has legitimate serious flaws.  And I won't be blindly defending it simply because I own some.
Always have an outlook to receive constructive criticism and improving self (or Bitcoin in this case) for better outcome.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:58:15
No one knows, but this isn't anywhere 'bottom' for me to buy BTC at the moment.  I can rather buy XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:21:43
I own bitcoin and I'm hodling.  But bitcoin is not a religion.  This kind of nationalistic mindset is dangerous.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:30:56
I hope so.  Then I cam actually buy a whole coin
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:49:39
Wow this is 16 hours ago and only 435 comments.  Are we shrinking?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:44:22
It's clear that it's still falling, now is not time to invest.  Still wait for the bottoming out.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:09:27
If I bought Bitcoin today, but I traded it for an altcoin after 3 months, does my long term capital gains 'clock' reset? (i.e. I have to wait another 12 mos).
