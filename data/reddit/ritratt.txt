Can anyone tell me how the bitcoin buying for this book/website works? I dont have a URI compatible wallet. It asks me to send BTC to an address but no instructions on what happens after that.

Wait wasn't the point of bitcoin freedom from banks?

Yup, that does make sense. I am off to be confused by the more complicated part now :)

This is nice. however, do u have safeguards against criminal misuse?

I second that. Bitmit is better and I have seen many TF2 items on sale there.

How will the currency spread and gain value through popularity when users insist on keeping 90% of it buried expecting it to gain value instead of using it everywhere like regular currency?
Is it really wise treating a currency like gold?

I understand that Bob's public key is hashed with other stuff which is basically his address. But I don't understand when you say "enough to verify a transaction". How is Bob's public key used to verify this transaction?

Okay this did shed some light but it is still a bit murky. Maybe I will think about it a bit more.
I understand now that the network only verifies ownership when one tries to spend or transfer some coins. So in the scenario above, the network doesn't care whether Bob got the coins or not. That will be taken care of when Bob tries to spend these coins. The network does, however, verify that Alice can actually spend the said coins. And this is done using Alice's public key to check her signature. Only she can sign because only she has the private key corresponding to public key for when she *received* her coins. Imma draw a flow diagram. But please correct me if I am wrong.
And thanks a lot for the answer!

ok thanks. so if he refuses I will cancel the deal then.

I agree. The point of any currency is not higher value but higher market penetration and acceptance. Bitcoin is not promising because I want to make money. Rather, it is promising because of its anonymity, non-fiat nature and because it is cryptographically secure.
