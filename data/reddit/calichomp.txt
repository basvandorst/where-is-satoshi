It is open source. Read the code.

This guy just trolled the entire community. All controversial  points will be pulled back. Lawsky will come out looking like a hero.

If he is German with a German bank account, you guys are missing the point. Just use euros.

Buyer beware:
I've heard tell in the Valley that these guys are past-due on their invoices to suppliers.  Yah... stuff like resistors, capacitors and inductors cost money.  This sounds like a clever fund-raiser so that they can pay past due debt.  They ran their first boards out of a place called Sonic:
You can see in some of the pictures of the guys proudly sporting first boards with Sonic MFG static smocks on.
MPP folks: I wouldn't hold your breath on receiving your 'complimentary' upgrades.

The TAM on reaching VCs is very low. Super neat and niche. But it is very low.

This is not how venture capital works.

Guys. Why are you spending your time shitting on a company that has been pro Bitcoin FOREVER, almost to a fault. When there are bigger things posing an existential crisis to Bitcoin? 
Segwit STILL isn't out yet. And BITMAIN are mining zero transaction blocks out of petulant spite. 
Get your ducks in a row. Don't just shit on a company trying to make Bitcoin something more than it is today. If you've built companies before, you can keep talking. Otherwise, get back on your armchair and try to do something productive for Bitcoin, like 21.co and Balaji.

You have no intimate knowledge of whether or not I have intimate knowledge of their finances or the terms of their VC deals.
In all seriousness though, that wasn't the point I was trying to make. The point I was trying to make is a general one about the timelines of VC money when it is deployed. They could be a special case, but usually you only get 18-24 months of extra life from external capital in an equity round.

You might not even be able to ask that question without the trailblazing efforts of 21. So no, I doubt it. I think there is proof here if you look at Bitcoin and Blockchain investments from '16 onward.

If you guys think this latest run up isn't driven by the bankers, you're living in denial. 
Bitcoin is being co-opted by the institutions it was meant to replace. Price is the Trojan horse. 
Think about it.

and then what are you going to do with it? they're trying to answer that question, right now.

Filing patents is nothing to be proud of in this day and age. It just goes to show that the leadership of Coinbase is still stuck in the past [banking / NY / assured-money-flow] frame of mind.

Wow they actually shipped on time. There is something to be said there.
