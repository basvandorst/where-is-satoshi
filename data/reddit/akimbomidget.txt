no problems. I'm not your target market anyhow. 
Hoped you got my note on actually stating the relevance of your link to a subreddit upfront. Its not obvious enough, and looked like spam (which arguably could be seen as such, even with the disclaimer).

hmmm... virtual secretary ? Botnet renter system? Automated Customer Service? Heck maybe even things that we don't even consider, e.g. Designing new ICs.
All these though require some pretty beefy hardware and the ability to simulate human thinking processes though... So at this stage it is just magic.
As for offspring creation. Provided we have a sufficiently advance AI, I think its quite possible we don't need 'sexual selection' to create new offspring, the AI could just spawn a new AI with modified source code by itself.

then maybe you should add that to the title next time. Arguably the relevance of this site to bitcoin is still a bit thin. But do add the message so you can clarify it.

Hmmmm... I wonder if you already took all the clothing variation already before selling it. I mean if multiple people choose the came clothing configuration, what would you do? Is there anything truly personal? (e.g. a little instruction to hold a sign saying "happy birthday jack" etc...)
To be honest, if I was a 'potential customer', looking at your site, I would be discouraged by the fact that I can't seem to find much detailed information about how the system works, and what the process is like. Interesting idea nevertheless.
