  1. She grew up in completely different world, generations ago.  That is not relevant to today's society except history.
  2. She is at an age that dementia and similar degeneration is common.
  3. Considering she's grown up in a different generation, she has NOT grown up with modern technology, and will not understand it as well as someone like me would.  (Developer / Programmer)
  4. You're implying that age equates to skill or knowledge, or even experience.  And it doesn't.  Developing cognition relating to performance and efficiency doesn't depend on time.  A retard isn't going to gain 100 IQ points by studying.

1.  500gB should last you years.
2.  Disk IO will be your bottle neck.  I highly suggest an SSD or better a NVME SSD. REQUIRED IF you plan on doing a lot of block analysis / rsyncing.
3. Again IF you are doing analysis, add "txindex=1" to your bitcoin.conf file.
4. Make sure you keep it updated.
5. Make sure to port forward.
6. Be aware of bandwidth costs. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:05:08
Real talk.
1. Bitcoin is NOT ready for public adoption.  It never claimed to be, but it's close. MONTHS AWAY PEOPLE! 
2. No coin is capable of handling world transaction volume, but Bitcoin is CLOSE to developing the capability.
3. If everyone uses SegWit NOW this transaction volume would go away for now, but we'll still be taking on new users.  The problem is that not even Bitcoin Core has fully tested and put SegWit into the GUI.  (it's usable on the command line)
4. Lightning is running on testnet.  It's developing at an astonishing pace.
Yes, the price of bitcoin may waver.  That may scare investors and impact the price, but Bitcoin has REAL potential.  All this is, is popularity of speculators outpacing it's current development.
I'm in this for the long haul.  I want Bitcoin to change the political landscape.

pruned nodes are not good enough.  Most of the population needs to be able to run FULL nodes.
Otherwise all the pruned nodes rely on centralized full nodes, which can bottleneck/censor transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:31:24
Not that fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:08:51
Just because more electricity is used, doesn't mean it's required to handle more transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:34:55
It doesn't need more electricity for more transactions.
You should stop talking about things you know nothing about. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:36:24
All transactions cost fees.
The more data in a transaction, the more it will cost. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:14:40
1.  Moving that piece of data makes transaction IDs reliable.  This fixes transaction malleability.
2. Moving the data doesn't actually give us more space, but that "witness" data (signatures) is given a large discount.  This means that blocks can actually store about 4MB total.
3.  Instead of saying a block is 1 MB, SegWit introduces "weight"   basically, **"regular transaction" data is limited still to 1 MB**, BUT Signature data (if moved, segregated, to the side) is given a 75% discount.
So.  Blocks are limited to 4 million WEIGHT.  Regular transaction data is 4 weight per byte.   Witness data is 1 weight per byte.
Witness data is given a discount because it can be pruned by the node, but It's still ALL verified and trust less.

@_date: 2017-12-26 15:20:07
It sounds like you don't tend to do any blockchain analysis (statistics/research), so you don't need the blockchain on an NVME.
I suggest an SSD then.  Your choice though.
Bitcoin is DISK, NETWORK, and SPACE, but Disk IO is likely your biggest bottleneck.  With each new transaction it validates, it has to check the entire history of bitcoin, which takes longer and longer to do.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:11:56
Again. You're over estimating. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:24:19
Segwit is fine to use. The only problem is that bitcoin core doesn't support it in the GUI, and several exchanges are holding off until more people use it. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:42:42
The big problem is that people argue, "there are too many transactions stuck in the mempool, 60,000!!"   when 50,000 are just spam.
Also, the spam pushes up transaction fees.  People see those 10,000 transactions and think, "I should make a fee that's higher to get in quicker"
THEN they can make MORE spam higher, pushing you to go to higher fees, while they rarely pay for real transactions.
Hence, spam, costing US money, benefiting miners, wasting my server's RAM, etc.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:24:43
Okay, what do YOU call it when you make 10,000+ transactions with 0.00001 fees to spend the VERY SAME amount over and over when that much isn't even in the address?
You don't call that spam?
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:30:21

@_date: 2016-01-11 19:24:19
**Let's make this clear.**
Coinbase is acting shady, and is RIGHTLY being removed because they are:
* Implementing test code in production
* \^without warning to their users
* \^on christmas
* Threatening money that isn't theirs
* Threatening a fork to bitcoin
* Threatening stability.
* Now submitting records to the IRS/US government
* Requiring further personal details, or you must close your account
* I cannot even withdraw my coins right now.
No serious channels that know what they're talking about approve of this sheer stupidity.
Regardless of how you feel about coinbase for you as a consumer, you MUST recognize they are ENDANGERING you.
So of course, bitcoin will NOT be directing users towards coinbase.

Hi there.  I have several ideas.
1.  Knowing the key, I'd identify its encoding and make sure it matches the required protocol for the service.  Specifically, I'd check the checksum and try to produce something valid, see where it fails.
2.  You mentioned you might have mixed up a character, in which case I'd set a script to iterate over each character, trying substitutions for every character.  (We're not guessing an ENTIRE key here, we only need to find the one or two wrong/missing ones, that's very possible to do VERY quickly)
    Think of it like this:
    * ????????????????????? =&gt; Impossible to guess.
    * as78df?78sd7f89saf70? =&gt; Very possible and and quick
3.  I'm confused on this point, however, to which I'd look it all up.  Does blockchain.info use the same private key format/method that is typically used anywhere?  Regardless, I expect the protocol to be well documented and available.  We should be able to deduce this.
Anyway, chill out.  Keep a level head.  Relax.  It sounds like you have almost the entirety of the key, so I doubt it's truly lost.

All the answers here are simply bad or wrong..
1.  Install Electrum (
2.  [Write down 13 RANDOM words from this list on your paper.](
3.  Start Electrum,  File-&gt;RESTORE,  Enter the 13 words.
Pro Tips:
1.  Your words are your wallet.  * You lose them, you lose your bitcoin. *
2.  Once you've loaded the words, you can save your "Master Public Key" to WATCH your wallet in the future.  This will allow you to watch and send TO the wallet, but NEVER OUT without the private key (the seed words)
3.  Electrum is safe, but not totally anonymous by default, unless you run your own server.  Your "Thin Client" (electrum) uses multiple people's server to watch your addresses.  This is how all thin clients work.
Here's a command to generate seeds:
    python -c "from electrum.mnemonic import Mnemonic; print(Mnemonic().make_seed());"
@_date: 2016-09-18 17:52:21
1. Reusing a single address is predictable.  Electrum beats this by generating new addresses infinitely for each transaction.
2. Once you have sent out from your single vanity address, the world knows the "public key", which they can then use to attack with quantum computing (when it becomes a thing)

**idiots**, or shills
1.  You can't even read.
2.  You don't understand basic supply and demand.  Whales only make big waves in small pools.  The market would clearly be less volatile as it gets deeper.  Like ANY market, EVER, IN HISTORY.

How does it not work like that?
Miners are refusing to mine blocks that the network wants.  The network can push UASF and FORCE miners out.
Am I incorrect?
@_date: 2016-05-18 15:27:53
1. It's easiest to send all your bitcoin to the first address within Electrum.
2. If electrum stopped working, stopped development, you could output the private keys for the specific bitcoin address, and use them to move the bitcoin.
3. BACKUP YOUR SEED WORDS.  BACKUP YOUR SEED WORDS. BACKUP YOUR SEED WORDS.

Keep in mind, if this person really is associated with Electrum, there are several things at stake.
    1.  Bitcoiners value anonymity, so of course a major trading client would want to talk about logging ip data on the down low.
    2.  Most servers, if not all, automatically log access requests and IPs by default.  It's not special and not particularly meant to track people.
Either way, it doesn't matter.

Do you have a machine you can leave running for a long period of time? 
My friend and I have recovered coins for people (for free), but that requires trusting us with the wallet. (you understand that risk) 
We could deliver you a script, easily, but the problem is it doesn't use GPU (yet) and will take a lot of time. 
I have thousands machines I can run against.
As for trust, I'm willing to share with you who I am and references. 
Otherwise, you will have to wait until we manage a GPU implementation.

Difficulty is re-evaluated and lowered every couple of weeks.
If the network only accepts UASF blocks, and I'm the only person mining blocks, the difficulty will readjust so that I mine blocks on average every 10 minutes, meanwhile, fuck all other miners.

In the case of Electrum, those seed words generate ALL of the encryption keys to your addresses. The seed IS basically your wallet.
When I refer to backups, I mean any important information should be in multiple places where it can't all be stolen/burned down at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:25:13
I believe it depends on segwit to restructure block data. 
You can't simply make a bunch of big changes at once. It takes months/years for each to be developed, tested, agreed on, rolled out, implemented, measured.

It appears the android "Bitcoin Wallet" uses BIP39.
I would suggest you:
1. Install Electrum
2.  Create a New Wallet -&gt; "I already have a seed"
3.  Advanced -&gt; "BIP39"  (Enter your seed words)
Electrum should generate the relevant addresses and allow you to spend that wallet (I believe)
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:28:09

around how much coin?
It doesn't make sense that electrum would fail to sweep it.

This is a public forum. 
You brought it up. I'm leaving a warning.

Are you dense?
Tails supports persistence.   I'm warning to not trust it.

Which when making payments, people get in the habit of not checking.


Again, same issue.


You'd be surprised.


Yet people do it anyway.
the entire point is that while a trezor is a convienient way to slightly increase physical security, it still is hard to do security.

If you're willing to share the wallet file, and what you believe the password to be, I'll add it to my cases.  You'll be case06  :)

Hi there,  and I volunteer recovering bitcoin for free.
Can you tell me more information about what you have?
I might be able to crack your wallet file with the right information.

Hi there, I volunteer my time helping people recovery their wallets.
It depends, what wallet was used to make the file?

Hi there.  I volunteer my time helping people recover bitcoin. 
You don't have to download the entire blockchain. Just dump the private key from the console using a command. 
Google "bitcoin core console commands"

You're right.
The hardware wallet provides more convenience and physical security.
* Hardware Wallets Pros
  * Potting Compound / Resin makes it difficult to modify without completely destroying.
  * Tamper protection built into the chips (should be, I haven't looked)
  * Power Analysis Resistant

Where are those users?  I've talked to people in real life and I haven't found one that backs BU.

Your fault.

FIRST thing, disconnect it, power it down.   
SECOND.   Copy the drive BIT FOR BIT.
THIRD.  ANALYZE THE COPY for the data you want.

You're suggesting SegWit doesn't provide that?
I have not seen a good breakdown of HARD DATA.

You're 2 weeks old. Lol
Dude.  I'm going SegWit.

Electrum checks the address and tries to move all funds to the electrum wallet. 
It's possible it didn't work correctly.  
Do you have the address and private key? 
You might want to check a block explorer online to confirm it holds funds.

We need a proper breakdown of pros/cons for each.
