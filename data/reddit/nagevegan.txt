This is absolutely perfect.

Yeah, that's a rabbit hole that even I haven't gone down far enough because of remnants of a successfully installed 'antisemite' stigma barrier. I don't know the actual percentage, or how many actually call themselves 'jews', or how many are working for themselves rather than as a group, _but_ I think it's pretty safe to say that the CIA and Mossad (and other 'intelligence' agencies) collaborate to control mainstream media in both the U.S. and Israel (and at least several other major countries).

Can you blame them?  
Would you put yourself in jail?

China again?  
Are we starting another fire sale already?

When you're a group of wealthy old psychopaths who've hijacked the world's most powerful military to insert puppet governments in all countries that don't bend to your will, this becomes entirely possible.  
Remember when Sweden was a haven for copyright opposers, free speech advocates and anti-war activists, then they suddenly tossed the Pirate Bay founders in prison and started aiding efforts to extradite dissidents on command?  
I do.

That's one of the primary concerns; that Bitcoin's a primer (conditioning system) for global currency created by an intelligence agency.  
Time magazine making that statement gives more weight to that concern.

Oops, didn't notice this was r/bitcoin (aka: Wall Street 2.0)

I assure you a second child is not a good thing.

Time magazine is known for being extremely corrupt (a CIA mouthpiece) so that statement has me worried that Bitcoin might actually have been created as a primer for the global currency of a global government.
