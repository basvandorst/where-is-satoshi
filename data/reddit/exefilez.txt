I'm not convinced GDAX has anything to do with it. I'm convinced big players do.

Angry again.

So basically, the price will go back up eventually, when they want it to?

They do it both ways. I just don't understand why they'd manipulate it lower. Every comment on this thread has been angry for no reason at all.

Wow you sure are all a very angry bunch over here at @_date: 2018-06-13 22:37:07
...your post is essentially
"God is good. God is good because nobody knew God was good until we knew he was good. God is good."
Blockchain is not new. Blockchain is torrenting, which has been around for 30+ years.

It's very similar to torrenting. I'm almost certain the creators took inspiration from torrenting.

You're like a child. In fact most people on this sub are like you. 
Inexperienced investors getting mad at people doing actually research and disagreeing with your hope of BTC being worth 2 million dollars per coin in 10 years. 
This whole "HODL AS LONG AS WE CAN" mentality of this sub is pathetic. It would be a much more useful sub if it was based on fact and not blind hope.
