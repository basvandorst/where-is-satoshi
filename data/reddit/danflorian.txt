...and no one has ever heard of technology improving, so why would we realistically expect the government to allow us to keep mining with our gaming laptops? 
But, then in reality, mining on a laptop is almost impossible, technology improves at an exponential rate, and renewable forms of energy are abundant, with many other solutions other than government provided or privately funded infrastructure. 
 
When people realise its not the 70's anymore we will have a revolution in a manner of perspectives, but until then were stuck with these bullshit talking points deflecting Bitcoins inevitable takeover of finance. 
Why does it make sense for me to send you money to a 3rd party, so they can take some, change it and give it to you in another country when we can all transact in the same denomination without need for middle-men?

Other than a trusted transfer between an individual I would not be aware of any ways under 2% that works internationally. Many services charge at least 3.5% if not more. After a quick look online, I found:
*Bitstamp* - 8% credit card, 0.25% otherwise
*Coinmama* - 6% purchase fee
*Paymium* - 8% for bank transfer ... **but**
You live in Paris, this service is based there and has the option of a SEPA EUR bank wire, which goes through for *FREE* ! (incoming wires are free but there is a 0.99 EUR charge for outgoing wires, damned fine print)
I only know what I’ve quickly researched as I have obviously never used these companies, but I hope you have some luck!

You can use other services like TransferWise if you think the exchange rate is being manipulated. They have a straightforward way of operation and I find their rates appealing enough to use their service.

It does when FIAT is the only accepted currency on the open market. 
Crypto needs a swipe card or something along the lines of ApplePay for BTC (CryptoPay or BitPay?) before it could be widely accepted.

Thanks, but automating investment is the same as automatic profits. You want to just diversify without knowing what you’re putting it into?
You know the amount of coins and their applications on the market currently? The only way to make a proper investment is to do the research yourself, not to look for robo-handouts.

It would be longer than 40 years. It would have to be after the point they stopped developing the products and also to the point where most of them would be considered to be fit for the landfill.
I don’t even know what it’s expected lifespan is, the Ledger Nano S doesn’t even have a battery so I would assume it would be when the components would deteriorate?
**EDIT** unless it was taken from a historical significance, perhaps a wallet from the biggest hack in history or a influential figure in the cryptocurrency space. The only other way it could go that high if BTC had no value would be if it was a unique design, perhaps limited edition.

I would have not withdrawn if I were you. Obviously, a bad decision on your behalf. This would have showed up before the confirmation of the transaction, no? 
So who’s to blame?
If it’s a problem of the specific crypto-coin you chose to use then you could have exchanged for another, less fee heavy coin like LTC when you choose to withdraw.

You aren’t creating value, it’s other people choosing to value it, it’s a transfer of value so to speak. 
People used to value gold as a physical asset, then after a few hundred years people adopted currency. Now with the digital revolution people are more so adopting digital currency due to its high liquidity and investment opportunities.

Stability = equity between the inflow and outflow of liquidity, which will either never happen or not until it reaches much higher levels that any removal of assets is covered by a counter-investment. 
It would require mainstream adoption at bare minimum, or the other extreme is that all faith is lost in Bitcoin and inflow of money stops. This seems almost impossible

Sure, it would be a centralized source of information to pump speculation and misinformation, but those are the people who need to either take that mis-info and get out or just be ignored. 
Embracing or engaging in any attempts to reverse sentiment would just create a feeling of being “attacked” by the ones who you want to be out in the first place, who then in turn defend themselves by fulfilling your “prophecy”

I would follow up with them but it’s possible it was if you don’t remember. It’s critical in crypto to ensure you are 110% certain of all values you are looking at on screen.
Even then you have to take into account malfunctions.

Yes people are accepting crypto but let’s not make it into more than it really is. People are investing now that they see it isn’t a scam, but are hesitant to use it as a currency as the application isn’t there, at all.
You can only buy from sole proprietors online and that in itself is sketchy.

If you spent $100 on a coin worth $150, your coins value would equal 0.66 (CRYPTO). 
So you take 
0.66 * 500 = 333 dollars gross 
Then after subtracting the initial investment;
333 - 100 = 233
You were exactly right. Don’t listen to these clowns

Exchange noted that funding is pending with one confirmation. It ended up costing roughly 7% for fees, kind of a sting but with the gains it’s kind of rude. It’s like getting a ride from a friend but complaining they too fast, redundant to complain if you’re benefiting.

I have learned to not doubt your gut. 
But I am still hesitant on diving in
After learning about the ease of exchanges I have converted a percentage of my recreational spending into crypto. With the announcement of futures I am bullish over the next few years, but concerned what the outcome would be.
Bull runs of this magnitude would only further the difference between the upper and lower class, as well as fuelling other currencies inflation as with every Bitcoin bought, it replaces its value in FIAT which adversely affects prices. This could be devastating to the world economy, but it’s not headed in the best direction in the first place. But this isn’t about politics.. 
But... to not have placed the money that I may have spent on going to the movies, or on a new sweater, to potentially improve my standing in the future? 
I am okay with that.
I am in debt, but I have had a plan prior to buying in, and have not changed it but only incorporated BTC into my miscellaneous purchases. 
Does this explain enough for you?

Every day I think the same thing my friend. I have learned slowly that unless you are in a comfortable position to have already gained profit before a dip happens, I would personally wait for either a rise or just ride the fall. 
You can regain the loss in the climb but you can’t regain principal already lost. With any small amounts I wait until I see a profit before I consider selling. It’s always more BTC in the end if you do the math right

Advisors in crypto space are usually biased to their own preferences, so there isn’t really a good way other than to make your own mind. 
Coins / tokens have a variety of usages so they are not only stores of value, they can be used as smart contracts or ledgers. Research into their applications is fairly straightforward when looking at an ICO’s / ITO’s white paper.

So, imagine it in this scenario:
Bitcoin market price is $7990

That $10 goes toward your mining fees / transaction costs to make them “free”, with whatever is left over being profit for the company.
Does that make sense?

Low fee transactions are serviced last by miners as they can prioritize and service the higher fee transactions first.
This leaves the lower fee transactions stuck in the memory pool, which slows things down. Eventually when the miners clear out the high fees the lower ones will be included, which will clear up network congestion

I think that with the amount of investors, adopters and people who genuinely need it because their own economy has a worse inflation rate than bitcoin does, I think it may dive but complete annihilation is unlikely given the current resistance.

“Flipping” BTC isn’t a thing... 
What do you mean by this?
If you mean buying and selling for profit, then one has to take into account transaction fees, exchanges take their cut as well and then you need to make sure that the spread (if any) isn’t so wide that it would cut into potential profit.
Then there is the insanely unstable price to deal with, which can change by the second.

@_date: 2017-11-17 22:11:59
That can be interpreted as a “sell wall” 
The amount of people looking to sell at a higher price than the market is currently asking for is larger than the amount of investors looking to buy at market price.
The inverse side of the picture shows the amount of people who want to buy, which as shown in that picture is not as strong at the current market price. 
(from what I know at least)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:27:31
It would require a $21 trillion ($21,000,000,000,000)  market cap, right now we sit at $167 billion. That still requires a 99% increase from this point, which is why the $10k is such a psychological barrier, it changes the percentage dynamic and the perspective. 
We are still at an extremely low adoption rate, not everyone uses Bitcoin for everything in their everyday life, only investors and some early adopters currently. 
It is still debated what the intention is whether a store of value or currency, if it can be both. 
It would take decades I think, maybe less

Subtract service fee from total.
It all makes sense.
First of all, use the same reading when looking at BTC, forget all that mBTC crap because it’s too easy to get confused.
Half of the transaction was sent, half was taken as mining fee and then GDAX took their service fee. If the amount you sent was the amount you received that means that GDAX price is higher than is should be, and the extra amount you pay goes towards paying the miners.

Let’s not take in to account the scale of the difference, never mind inflation and banks having had a field day in the last few decades has left billions laying around waiting for investment, along with the average joe. 
Honestly, they want it to crash SOOO BAD it’s fucking hilarious. I’m gonna buy the dip so hard, I’ve got an envelope saved up specifically labeled “BANK FUD FUND”

The article is from April 2017. I hope you managed to read that far. All I had to see was the poor design and language used on the page to tell it’s a fake. They’re getting lazy with their attempts to trick people

That’s a lot of low fee transactions -.-
No wonder the price has stalled

Anybody have thoughts / experience with ‘nTrust’?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:11:13
In the matrix..
But seriously. It’s online (or if you choose a hardware alternative it can be a device) on a wallet that is essentially just code.

QuadriaCX allows you to sell for CAD
nTrust can link to your bank account to Buy / Sell BTC
I live in Canada and these are the two, most trustworthy options that I can vouch for so far. Both require verification but they work, I’ve used them both.

Please don’t tell me this is what is flooding into Bitcoin right now or I am WAY OUTTA HERE !
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:06:55
Or if you want the offline computer option:
1. Plus computer into internet
2. Download Bitcoin Core
3. Wait forever for it to catch up-to-date
4. Once fully installed, remove from internet while not using, or you can also save the “wallet.dat” file to a USB drive which does the same thing.

It’s not because countries can not control their spending, which sends the currency into the toilet by jacking inflation? 
So the people who use crypto because it is their only viable currency... that’s speculation?
You’re not wrong that somethings got to give, but I don’t think that it’s Bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:41:32
I used to use them both, being Canadian it was my only option to buy was Coinbase. 
But I didn’t like the fact I have no control on Blockchain other than transferring wallets, so I found a company in British Columbia called nTrust who have accounts where you can transfer BTC = CAD back and forth with fairly decent rates (better than a few I’ve seen)
I’ve been using them for just over a month, but my verification was completed fairly easily and from there its been smooth sailing. ⛵️ 
Everyone’s situation is different but that’s what has worked for me so far (still fairly recent joining)
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:37:37
They do not allow bank transfers with Coinbase in Canada, I don’t know why they don’t get on that because QuadriaCX and nTrust both have debit/chequing account deposit options. 
Maybe they are getting enough service through their credit card fees they’d rather not give people the option to pay less...

Maybe it will push $7.5k but I doubt it’s going lower that $7k, the resistance is too high. Looking at order books at least.. Even that is looking optimistically for a nice dip
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:56:21
But seriously, I have no idea.. 
I thought if the funds didn’t match the transaction plus the mining fee then it gets rejected, but that might be a feature inherent within the trading platforms and not part of the way the blockchain operates?
I’ve never gotten it to work before.. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:11:08
I’m slowly leaning to creating my own rig and supporting the network with my own node. =)
Worst comes to worst I’ve got a great computer with a interesting story to tell. I have tested mining with older computers but never developed my own rig.

Have you seen what the current people in charge are doing? I don’t trust them but I have no other option to deal with their bullshit..

With adoption from Square I can see something maybe being pushed from their end to try and speed up transactions...
Not necessarily a bad thing 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:04:10
It’s simpler to HODL.
That’s why people choose it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:39:11
I would assume most miners are set up and then not really updated much other than technical maintenance. 
In order to change the way things are done would it not require an agreement and more importantly understanding on all miners behalf to switch software in order to unify the methods used?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:58:15
Buying at an ATH might not be the best idea, but stalls and dips are seeming to be less significant than the gains &amp; farther between. 
Always a toss up

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:33:02
Agreed. I have never had this experience. 
I live in Canada and have my credit card hooked up through Coinbase which allows an instant buy of Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin at 3.5%
(Best option so far unless I’m funding over $300, then rates are better on QuadriaCX, but their verification took about 4-5 days)
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:55:18
Not dumb, it’s better than wasting it. HODL for the win
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:48:25
Fiat changes daily as well, we just don’t adjust per transaction as BTC does, which is inherently a benefit rather than a negative. 
I would prefer my value of my currency to reflect the worth, opposed to set prices for goods with a currency that fluctuates in “value”
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:20:45
Have you checked the market aggregate? I found those numbers to be more accurate

Bitcoin had zero value less than 10 year ago, yet its impossible to comprehend a 192x growth?

That’s why I said PARTICIPATION, not holding actual currencies. Naïveté would predicate not understanding a concept or viewpoint.
Obviously people won’t be holding bitcoin with this, but it will create a precedent of understanding &amp; possibility of continuing progress with increased activity in the community, advancing as a whole.
