Moved to Brazil (Sao Jose Do Rio Preto) on Friday.  Haven't seen anything Bitcoin yet.
If anyone is in the bitcoin space down here, let me know!  I would love to get involved.

I'm a graphic designer ... not sure I have all that much time, but I could possibly run through the presentation when it's done ... the cleaner it looks the more respected it will be.  Also would be great to share the deck for everyone who needs.

Where is A place in Chicago that accepts?  I have only heard that Emporium Arcade was thinking about it ...
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:27:48
Thanks! and sorry been busy, will try to get more for you soon!

They come and go, not really a set time ... just keep checking.  If they are available that message won't appear at all (appears now before you even try to buy).
When they are available they go quickly.
(I've bought mine from there)

Extremely ROUGH draft to get ideas flowing...

If you are in the states, the EASIEST way is through coinbase.com you can hook up your bank account and then purchase

Hi Richielaw,
I'm in Chicago, would love a bitcoin meetup.  I've seen this and was thinking about attending June 4th ...
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:12:04
Ya agreed, I work monroe/wells (graphic designer by trade) ... Let me know if you are looking for any help/investors.  I've been thinking about something like this but don't care to take on risk myself.  
Good luck!

lol it says right there... Betteridge has admitted to breaking his own law (writing a question headline with the answer "yes"), in an article published at his own site.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:47:41
Ah yes, you are right.
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:31:50
Thanks! See you there.

Just use coinbase.com then if you want to do some trading move it over to mtgox.
Coinbase allows you to hook up your bank ... takes about a week to get the coins, but you'll be locked in the price you purchased and bitcoin is "relatively" stable right now so shouldn't be a big deal
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:47:45
To be honest haven't tried, but you can move to blockchain/wallets... so prob can move then to mtgox, but don't quote me :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:03:46
Yep you are apply apply back to your bank account... also with coinbase, when prices are less volatile they are more inline with everywhere else.
I'm in it for the long hall so $5-10 either way didn't bother me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:48:51
Awesome, wish I could help ... I'm a graphic designer, so if anywhere down the line you need help in that regard ... I'm willing and able!

Brigado! Vc esta perto do Fortaleza? Quero ir lá!

IMO, if you want to be able to buy gas and groceries with Bitcoin and believe in Bitcoin you should put more in now ....
The higher the market cap, or more money in, the more companies are going to want to tap into that market ... eventually some gas stations will use it as a differentiator if they could have Bitcoin business.

I heard a while back Emporium arcade was thinking about accepting bitcoin ... It maybe a good idea to look into somewhere in wickerpark.  Something tells me they may be a more interested crowd at the moment, plus it's 6 corners you'll get traffic 24/7
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:32:50
Nice job!
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:08:28
Just wanted to post this article I found interesting ... and I'll let everyone else draw their own conclusion to how it relates to bitcoin!  
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:59:11
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:04:53
I'm sorry, would you be able to give a brief explanation of what's going on at your buy/sell markers? Obviously I know nothing and I apologize
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:33:10
good point!
