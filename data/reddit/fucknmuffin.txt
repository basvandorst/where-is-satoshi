The cost of purchasing it.  
and of course "The value of it doesn't matter as long as it doesn't drop" it does constantly drop so every other day the value would be fucked.

doesn't feel sideways to me. I've made a fair bit, I feel 9k is pretty realistic currently (maybe even 8k), And I intend to buy more at these prices.

No we're not. You're getting to caught up in popular news.  
I challenge you to find a source showing citizen minorities are losing rights.

Exactly my point, The US and in fact all countries used to be significantly worse.

I like it, feels more nostalgic. I feel btc matches well with those themes.

my credit cards are the opposite. They're cool with large purchases at stores or in countries i've never been to. But then they block $1-15 dollar purchases on ebay and amazon, it's weird.  paypal is the worst, they just froze my account without a reason.

not done    
This is exactly popular news, a specific case that is not consistent. 
And further it's about a non-citizen issue, oddly something i referred to above that you ignored.. Sure the guy the article is about was a citizen but as it states "detained Galicia anyway over suspicion that his documents were fraudulent." and he was with undocumented immigrant.
Here's a cop shooting killing a white guy. It's done more often then that!  Maybe just maybe we live in a police state and in fact minority citizen rights are better than ever.

They are investing in the AUD and GBP and CAD and XAU (gold)? this doesn't make much sense.

bitcoin doesn't make sense as a national reserve... It would cost massively too much.
