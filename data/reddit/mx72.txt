But if the only people investing were the "adopters" the price would never have climbed anywhere near this high in the first place.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:24:35
I made a similar mistake selling a bunch of BTC for ETH the first time ETH approached $400 and started to come close to BTCs market cap.  Then the trend reversed.  It hurt.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:33:07
Probably not worth it. But the best time would be during a slow time when coins are cheap and mining competition is low.  Earn some coin and then hold and hope for a price rise.  The only way miners make anything significant is when the price explodes and the value of the coin they are holding goes way up.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:11:05
It has the potential to change the way transactions are processed, sure, but its not going to change the industry.  At one time records were kept on paper, now its electronic, soon it may be blockchain... but the business model hasn't really changed much.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:49:51
Anybody that's ever looked at a stock chart before was saying the exact same thing lol
@_date: 2018-05-30 00:31:02
Is it?  I've heard of them, never actually seen any so idk...
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:21:38
He was clearly referring to the recent rise.  Shorting is almost never a long term play.
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:11:58
The whole point of this has completely gone over your head.
When BTC is the "world currency" and someone wants to buy a house (but dosent have the BTC on hand), how exactly do you think that situation will play out?  Perhaps someone will loan it to them...
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:55:04
Na its just the online equivalent of cash.  Blockchain tech can improve the internet but not in the form of new coins.. we need some platforms with uses beyond just digital "coins".
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:48:42
Point being, its peanuts to banks.  If they thought it was a threat they could took care of it. 
Get lost and have fun being broke you dumbass troll.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:31:53
Why do so many people think BTC will end banks?  Banks don't create currency, they make money loaning to people.  They also hold tons of other assets.  If Bitcoin becomes mainstream, why wouldn't banks just start using \(loaning\) it just like they do now?
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:00:12
Yes it does... The earnings of mining is basically completely offset by the cost of the electricity to do it.  The only way to really profit is if the bitcoins you mine go up in value.  I never advised to mine, its not worth it.  Id just buy them.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:22:10
Still not sure why that would be the case.  Large banks have been around a long time and work with all types of currencies, why wouldn't they just adopt btc if thats what people start using?  If anything, credit card companies could be effected since they make a lot of there money processing online transactions.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:05:19
Wow your clueless lol.  Banks have been around for longer than most countries, you really think this one advance in tech will completely derail them? No way.  And consumer debt is reckless for the consumer but incredibly profitable for the lender, thats exactly why it exists.  Banks own massive amounts of every currency, real estate, company equity, and practically everything else.  They are in the business of loaning and investing, whatever the asset is is completely irrelevant to them. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:48:01
Your obviously the one that does not even understand the basics... It would only take about $130 billion to buy all btc at current prices.  About $300b to buy all major crypto.  Thats exactly what market cap means.  All crypto in the world adds up to the value of about one large company. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:49:56
You don't get it.  Banks are only in the business of loaning money, then making a return on the loan.  Its  simple.  They have been doing it forever and seen a million changes in technology.  If they were concerned why wouldn't they do something about it? They have more than enough cash on hand to buy up the whole crypto market if they wanted.
Here you go: [
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:32:30
The only thing that determines the price is what the last coins sold for.  It's purely supply and demand.  Google is just referencing a price on an exchange \(or maybe an average of a few exchanges\).
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:17:52
Electricity costs money, so the miners with the most efficient systems benefit the most.  Some have access to really cheap electricity or solar setups where electricity is basically free, so thats who your competing against.  Before you actually turn a profit you will need to cover electricity costs as well as whatever the initial investment was \(mining equipment \+ solar setup if used\), so most casual miners probably dont make much if anything.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:16:16
Yeah its definitely not usable in real business at all.  I do accept it at my small business and have had clients offer to pay with it but almost never use it because Credit Cards are so much easier, faster and usually cheaper.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:19:49
Yup an it will probably get worse.  Litecoin looked like it was dead after the 2013 crash and many of the top coins from back then disappeared.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:12:06
Just remember, all these "experts" don't have a clue where the price is going.  Your guess is just as good as theirs.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:46:31
He is simply referring to the current prices of crypto, they are very high at the moment and likely to go lower.  He isn't really referring to the technology itself.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:41:10
Whats your point?  Have you ever looked at a chart of the NASDAQ?  It crashed ridiculously hard in late 90s due to being over-hyped and didn't recover for well over a decade.  Tons of the early "big names" totally flopped and many, many investors got crushed.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:10:08
Ive spent thousands of $ worth of bitcoin over the past 5 or so years... But I know im exception.  It works but its not as easy or efficient as current methods and the volatility is a total deal breaker.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:46:41
Why does this make any sense?  So if it goes to 0, its still 1 bitcoin, is it still a good currency?  1 Venezuelan bolívar is still 1 Venezuelan bolívar, is that a good currency?
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:31:07
Ok, so what?  There's literally over 1500 other cryptocurrecies with "limited supply" and bitcoin itself forked like 50 times this year, creating "new bitcoins" which all had limited supply... so whats so unique about that? Having a limited supply doesn't automatically make it a usable currency.
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:01:35
Most people talking about crypto have never invested in anything before... why would you expect them to know anything about investing or market behavior?  The most ignorant are often the loudest lol
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:15:10
Its not really bizarre at all for bubbles to occur, its just natural market behavior.  Look at the Nasdaq or oil or housing markets... they have all done the same thing, and not necessarily because of bad news.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:12:04
Every article that comes from these bitcoin/crypto websites is always 100&amp; garbage.  Just pure hype.
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:36:36
If everyone already knows about it, your too late lol
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:58:21
You definitely need to be going against the masses to really make money.  You'll never get rich just following a herd of sheep.  As soon as all the noobs that never invested in anything before start buying, that should be a your signal to start selling.  The best time to be a seller is when everyone wants to buy, and vice versa.
And just plain common sense helps too... if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:06:54
Why the F would he describe it as a "bubble" if he wasn't referring to the current hype and price increase.  It says right in the article he sold near the peak, obviously anticipating a crash.
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:41:18
Do any of these actually get any real volume?  I would be interested but they all seem completely dead.
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:42:20
How so?  I dont think  I do at all.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:42:25
Not really, I think lots of people recognize the potential, but they also recognize what a bubble looks like... being in a bubble isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself, unless the asset crashes and never recovers.  Calling it a bubble is just stating the obvious.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:59:24
Im not sure what your point is about any of that.  I didn't say to "never sell".  Eventually you need to sell (or spend it) to buy stuff.  I was simply saying that day trading will not make you money in the long term.  You will see.
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:41:29
Yes if/when the market matures it should stabilize.  That's how it could succeed. 
Your stating that being unique is the thing making BTC a good currency.  That's a totally baseless argument.  If that was so critical why not just go back to a gold standard and use gold/silver coins?  There are a million "unique" items in the world, and practically NONE of them are currencies.  Being stable, easy to use, and widely accepted matters.  One of the things making USD a good currency is its acceptance and the fact that the worlds strongest economy and massive military back it up.  Whether that is a good thing or not is totally other topic.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:25:27
Exactly, a currency needs to be trade-able.  With huge swings it is not usable to trade for anything.  And yes, currencies absolutely are worth less when they fall compared to others... that was exactly the point with the bolivar comment.  It sure seems like Venezuelans care about the value dropping lol.  A gallon of water will always be a gallon of water, is that a currency too?
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:30:14
Either way, its good your learning.  Hopefully prices keep going up and we all make money!
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:28:44
The point is 1 Bolivar still equals 1 Bolivar.  Just like 1BTC will always be 1BTC, but that alone dosent make it a good currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:49:50
Wealthy people generally aren't usually looking for such high risk investments. They don't need to.  And he also realized it was a bubble lol.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:52:32
Theres no way anyone will use it anytime soon.  The volatility makes it useless as a currency, its simply a form of gambling right now.  Once (or if) the Market Cap does get big enough it should become more resistant to huge price swings.  Its like a penny stock vs a large cap stock.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:52:15
Lol its hilarious how people on here really don't understand what it even means... Its to be expected in disruptive technology such as this. 
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:19:13
Yes because that strategy has worked extremely well so far.  Many people have made huge fortunes that way.  People have been trading assets forever (long before crypto) but practically none get rich from it.
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:00:54
I totally get the limited supply argument, yes blockchain tech is revolutionary in that regard.  But the point of this thread is that it cannot be a widely used currency with such extreme volatility, which is 100% true.  Just having limited supply alone doesn't really mean much.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:40:51
Lol the article was pretty vague, I wouldn't read too deep into it.  In general it sounds like he is a fan of the technology and thinks it has potential but he also thinks the current rise was a bit extreme, making it a bubble right now.   
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:27:01
Most people day trading are newbs thinking they can make quick money. They learn the hard way that it's not that easy.
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:28:02
Sure.  But the only people that lost money are the ones that bought in late 2017.  If you bought and held literally any other time except those few months you are up.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:05:52
So there's $20/month.  You got me!
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:51:48
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:49:50
I completely agree.  A $70b market cap is no joke.  In my eyes it already has succeeded (at least as a proof of concept for blockchain tech) and has already skyrocketed, but mainstream adoption has been tough so far.  But it could easily skyrocket again.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:53:44
After this boom settles down a lot of them will completely disappear.  I remember there being a lot of new "revolutionary" coins during the $1200 bubble, most crashed hard and never recovered. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:24:57
Yes they do... the same way the Chinese ban is somehow actually good news lol. I'm optimistic about Bitcoin, I'm just not an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:41:25
So true.  Even if cryptocurrency is the future that doesn't mean the end of banks.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:36:22
That is not what it is "backed" by at all... your just describing inflation/deflation.  Reliable FIAT is backed by governments with strong economies and a military.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:12:57
If I listened to what broke ass people like you thought, I'd probably still be broke too.  :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:31:43
Yeah... nobody is actually using it for any of that.  Its only real use currently is black market purchases and money laundering.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:38:08
Im aware that its possible to buy things with it, but practically nobody is.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:36:45
It would be a massive blow to bitcoin.  Any hint of that happening would cause a huge price drop.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:30:55
Sure they do.  When you buy bitcoin on an exchange you are transferring money from a bank account to an exchange, so banks make that possible.  They could easily not allow that, especially if government ban it, and that would be a huge problem for bitcoin.  For Bitcoin to succeed they will need to coexist.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:39:50
Yeah because 800% growth in a year is totally natural. Not. I've been in this since they were $100, this isn't my first bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:11:53
Im sure he is very familiar with crypto. Hes probably been well aware of it since it came out in 09 and knows more than 99% of the people in this forum.  He is also very familiar with how markets and the economy work, probably more so than almost anyone on the planet, which would in fact would make him an expert in cryptocurrency since it is, after all, a CURRENCY.  
And btw, I do think bitcoin is here to stay, although who knows at what price.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:04:55
He's been pretty famous, hes CEO of one of the largest banks in the world. Thats why people care so much about his opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:18:47
I've spent thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin since first buying in 2012.  But I know I am the very rare minority and for the most part it is not used beyond speculation.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:08:52
Nobody is using a currency that can fluctuate by 1/3 in a day. Your delusional if you think it's being used. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:58:17
lmao..  Im sure your one of the clowns that bought my bitcoins around $4500 that i purchased for $500 about a year ago.  this is the second bubble I've made a killing off of.  Yeah I have no clue.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:29:49
I was an early adopter supporting bitcoin since 2012.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:36:56
It seems like some level of censorship is almost inevitable if it wants to succeed as a mainstream currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:08:31
Is $3500 supposed to be cheap? Lol they were like $500 just a year ago 
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:08:43
He's not even hating on Bitcoin really, he has talked positively about Blockchain technology in the past. He's just skeptical about Bitcoin as an actual currency, and rightfully so.  Everything he says is on point.

@_date: 2017-09-28 04:03:39
Governments will want to track it to some extent, for tax purposes and such.  But if your using it for legitimate business that's what you'd expect and it shouldn't be big deal.

If I listened to what broke ass people like you thought, I'd probably still be broke too.  :)
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:27:15
It definitively seems like the market is getting pretty delusional at this point.  Probably a better time to be selling than buying.

Theres a reason hes CEO of JPM.  He know what he's talking about.

It was pretty much just a loophole that allowed people to raise money based on nothing with almost no restrictions.  Just a new form of gambling.

I sold a lot of mine recently because I am somewhat nervous that we are entering a bear market.  The current "hype cycle" feels similar to the way the 2013 bubble played out.  Also, the SegWit2X debate does seem uncertain and I also think some crackdowns from more regulatory agencies could be coming soon.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:37:06
Your right to be wary... everyone on here is extremely bullish.  I believe in it as well but it still remains to be seen if mainstream adoption will happen.  I was buying since they were $100 and to be honest I haven't really seen any progress as far as real world use, just more people becoming aware and investing.  It could come crashing down anytime.   
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:03:03
Yes, and I think eventually it will go up.  But at this point it feels a lot like wishful thinking from people that bought in recently and are hoping for massive gains overnight. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:52:57
I definitely understand what "money" is and "money" isn't supposed to fluctuate like this.  Its clearly driven by greed and speculation.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:04:12
It's hilarious how every time someone says something negative about Bitcoin everyone in here assumes it's market manipulation. I highly doubt he even cares. He's just giving his opinion on it because he was asked. The dudes loaded why would he be making gambles like that?  He has no interest in manipulating Bitcoin. And all the purchases were client decisions, not JPMs decision. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:11:03
A few guys in suits? Lol or how about being backed by the worlds strongest economy and strongest military?  You forgot about that.
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:39:42
Um, because its accepted by the US gov. and can be used to purchase things anywhere in the US and many other places.  If that doesn't matter, explain why its the most desired currency in the world...
And that chart shows inflation, which is actually a good thing for a currency, it gives people incentive to spend it rather than just hold on to it.  Economics are complicated.
@_date: 2018-07-12 11:50:46
Your right that no one can predict it but buying into anything that has just went up 20x in a year is just bad investing.  Your setting yourself up for huge losses, you need to anticipate that there will be a downside after a bull run like that.  
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:06:33
Bought my first btc for under $100, made money in the 2013 rally as well.  This time sold most around 17k. Your riding it right back down like an idiot lmao.
I win, you lose.  Peace loser.
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:14:30
Its not legit at all.  There is no program or person that can predict where it will go.  But thats not to say it wont go lower, it certainly could.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:31:43
Yeah... nobody is actually using it for any of that.  Its only real use currently is black market purchases and money laundering.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:36:16
Censorship resistance isn't "the whole point".  It can be, but we will see how censorship resistant it is when someone actually tries to censor it lol. Blockchain is an open source platform that allows people to use it however they see fit, lots of companies will probably use it to maintain ledgers of different types.

Because no ones actually using it for anything other than speculating and day trading.
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:55:46
The economy and military are the ONLY things impacting it, otherwise its just pieces of paper.  There is a lot of effort put into trying to maintain a steady inflation rate, all other currencies are the same.  If the gov wanted to stop inflation, they could just print less.
And no kidding people try to hold ASSETS that increase in value, that's called investing, but that's not at all the purpose of a currency.  You've been blinded by the bitcoin hype lol 
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:16:23
Thats true that it could get some free publicity, but I still don't think it would impact overall sales.  They dont have much to lose at this point tho lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:57:12
Thanks for the totally irrelevant image.
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:43:40
I bought in way before you for cheap and cashed out near the top, to an idiot like you who payed 20k for a bitcoin.  I gladly paid my taxes on all that free money.  Make sure to write off your loses against your taxes.
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:07:09
It wouldn't add up to anything significant.  Places that accept it will tell you its such a small portion of sales its irrelevant.  
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:34:54
Not sure what you asking... Im just saying that currently no one is actually buying bitcoin to use it, only to speculate and trade and try to make money, so it will be prone to massive price swings.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:16:09
Even 3 months ago it was half this price. If you think these prices are cheap your the dumb money lol. Just because someone is new doesn't mean they can't look at a chart
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:42:27
I think the point hes making is you have no recourse, as opposed to credit cards or PayPal where they are responsible for fraud and charge-backs are (often) possible.  But still, its not a great argument.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:51:48
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:12:13
Agreed.  Im thinking it may settle down around those prices for a while until the next big rally.
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:52:40
Pretty much all my banking is free.  For my small business credit card fees are a much bigger deal but its still wayyy more efficient and convenient than using crypto honestly (although i do accept btc)

Read my other comments below you clueless moron.  Currency is supposed to be inflationary.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:03:29
Sure but you can also argue that its worth nothing since its not really accepted hardly anywhere lol.  Only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:52:28
Nobody knows for sure but if it does rally again it probably wont be for a long time.  Give it a few years for price to settle and the market to mature into usable products then it will grab peoples attention again.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:25:08
No one can accurately predict where the value of any assets/equities are heading.  Lots of people devote their whole career to trying to predict these things and still can't consistently beat the market.  Never trust anyone who claims to "know" where price is heading, they are either scammers or just plain ignorant.

Although acceptance is actually decreasing due to the extreme volatility.  A lot of companies that jumped on-board back in 2013 have since ditched it.

Doubt it.  These pumps keep failing to generate any real upward momentum.  Not a good sign.

We keep seeing these pumps but they keep failing to generate any real upward momentum.  Then the buyers sell off a day or two later with whatever gains they have.  It doesn't look like new money flowing in that's for sure.
