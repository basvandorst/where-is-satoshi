Ohh, would you restore it when you want to do something? Or do
You just keep your address around and check through some service/site?

I see. I figured if someone gets a hold of the wallet file it'd be somewhat game over (or at least, not good). But yeah, thanks for being so patient here :)

I thought the wallet was the file itself rather than the GUI (eg electrum app etc)?

I'm still not exactly sure, so is the wallet file important? What's the password (in electrum app) for?
Does the 12 words re create the wallet file? Does the wallet file contain the bitcoins themselves and if that case, how can the codes I got now regenerate them if they are transferred into that file at a later point?
Maybe there's some link or basic info I've overlooked.

Hmm, so to be clear - you have a wallet file that you use, but you only backup the recreation seed?

I see. So the coins themselves are just virtual on the blockchain itself and the "wallet" is more like an ID card that says you are the owner of a particular spot in the ledger? 
As opposed to a physical wallet where physical money are stored within.
Thanks for replying by the way.

I thought that by itself created the wallet file. If I then understand it correctly it just recreates your wallet for the period of the app being open? The next time you do the same again.

Where do you store the / your wallet file that you "use" for send/receive actions etc?

Another newbie question, about securing the wallet.
So I use electrum and I just withdrew some small amount that I bought from some exchange, quite a bit went to fees, but I just wanted to get a feel for it.
Right now I have the `default_wallet` (I didn't rename it) file in a VeraCrypt (RIP TrueCrypt) file that I put into Dropbox. And the passwords + word sequence key is in 1Password. And one paper copy.
Is there something else I should be doing? Or something that I should not be doing?

I'm reading a bit on bitcoin.org, and I downloaded Electrum as well.
I'm a bit confused about the actual practical step by step process of "securing my wallet". Is the wallet the actual file that gets generated in (in my case ~/.electrum/wallet). Is that the file I need to encrypt, or is it already safe as is? I entered both password in the app, as well as getting the 12 words for re-generation. Would chucking that file into a TrueCrypt-like app with some password file be enough?
I'm also confused about the "private key". Is the key the 12 words I got?

Whe you say you don't store you wallet file at all, did you just mean as a backup version then?

So? I am sure such error happens in normal banks too. Depending on the audience they can decide on what is best to share. In case of a public technical forum, this is good. For a granma? Just tell her it's an error and refund her.
