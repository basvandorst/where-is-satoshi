Its ok, dont pay attention to any of them.  We will be the ones smiling when Bitcoin rises ;)

Since September when he came out and began talking down about Bitcoin,  the media started putting it more and more on television.  This has ruined bitcoin for me.  And its only going to get worse.

The government is already planning on releasing its own crypto.  Its called "Digital Dollar".   It will be regulated to the max and may be substituted for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:36:38
No! Because then all you would be doing is causing FUD to all these people when the number grows lower.  New people would see it and would say ahhh Bitcoin is running out, its too late and look the other way.

I live right on the border of Mexico and Texas,  Mexico is like 5 minutes away from here.  I trade on there all the time as a US citizen.  Mexico has a very strong Bitcoin presence that never gets noticed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:56:05
you see I am confused on this too.  If the US wants it shutdown, can they?  Bitcoin didnt start in the US did it?  And how would they go about doing it?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:19:46
too complicated dude.

Please get over yourself.

I just withdrew over 75 BTC in the span of two days and it went through successfully.  Im not verified at all!

Not sure but its pretty stupid how they told every one that they would receive some after the fork.  the fork came and went,  nothing.  Murphys law
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:47:34
You see this is why I am embarrassed to introduce new people to Bitcoin.  This is why we cant have nice things in life.  Instead of enjoying Bitcoin and the altcoins, we now have to worry about what comes in the future due to these couple of greedy bastards.

How can I send a personal message to these ass clowns that are creating all of this chaos?  Can some one link me directly to them so I can give them a piece of my mind. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:31:44
Its funny because I stopped buying bitcoin about 6 months ago.  And just two days ago I decided to get back on it.  I bought and then it plunged! hahah  Fucking weird ways of life.  One thing I did learn, never to sell again! Maybe a couple years from now yeah, but now no! just buy!
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:23:45
Im not black so I couldnt understand this.

I buy instantly on coinbase.  So when I buy its instantly there.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:14:04
Dudes! This is exactly what happened with me 3 days ago! I hadnt invested in BTC in over a year just because I was so busy with my business. Well my dad comes along to visit and I mention to him that I saw bitcoin at over $4000!  The last time we had talked about it was when it was $300.  Well we had a good conversation about it and he said that he would be coming tomorrow to give me some money to buy some for him.  Well he shows up the next day, telling me how Bitcoin is on the news , and how its a fraud and how JP Morgan said so.  Now he thinks I am in some illegal shit.  I told him, " Dad,  everysingle day I break the law, I dont care!"!
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:58:43
Im more in the ,  I havent bought BTC in over a year because when I used to buy, it would always drop like in the next 5 minutes.  Its been a year I think Ill give it another shot,   Ok Ill buy some at $4300...  OMFG,  it dropped again! WTF! FUCK YOU BITCOIN! FUCK YOU!!!!!!

*Credit Unions.  
 I use a bank called Woodforest.  Everything is smooth.  Except one thing,  when I buy on coinbase my bank charges me a $2.00 international fee.   That sucks!  so I make sure to buy in big amounts. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:04:31
ha same here! 
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:54:34
No, but I would still be buying a shit load of BTC at that price. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:23:17
Where do you buy? coinbase?   Ive been buying from Coinbase but what sucks is my bank charges me a $2.00 international fee everytime I buy from coinbase.
where do you buy?
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:56:33
Ummm Yeah some one in here owes me $15.00.  16mjGgNevAcfZbtHCt86mmc8w6Zjv6mYC6

I recommend just getting over it.  Pussy is pussy.  You can find it anywhere. Now Bitcoin, now thats $$$ you cant get anywhere.  I suggest you live you life, dont tell any one about Bitcoin, let it be your little secret ;)
My plan:  Since 2013 I have been buying Bitcoin and saving it.  I dont plan on living past another 10-20 years, so Im leaving it all to my son.  If Bitcoin drops, its ok,  I have a shit load of it!

Just for the record,  Im not buying ARK or any alt coins.  Only BTC

So lets say you have all your BTC in Bittrex.  Will we recieve  the Bitcoin Gold in Bittrex?

Congratulations!  I lost count on how much Ive bought through out the years.  Everyday I buy $30~50 on Coinbase.  Never have had any issues with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:21:23
Yes Coinbase.com.  After you register with them and enter all your info you should be able to buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:14:23
Long story short, you are never seeing that money again.  Sounds like they pulled a Cryptsy.  Cryptsy kept about $600 worth of BTC from me. When they went to court I signed up,  nothing ever came my way.  I called the lawyers who were involved in the case and all of their phone numbers are now disconnected and emails are ghosts. Pretty sad huh. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:30:29
Oh also, you can buy it instantly.
