They're trying to regulate it because Korea's full of gullible middle/late-age technopeasants running Windows XP who blindly follow the latest fad.  Bitcoin in Korea is bound to end up with a bunch of people who get hacked and exchanges that make off with people's Bitcoin.

US government has people who will take damaged cash, examine them to figure out how much they were, and compensate you.  [This Planet Money segment]( indicates you need to send in greater than 50% of each bill or convince the examiners that the rest of the bill was completely destroyed.  Doesn't mention serial numbers, but maybe that plays a factor as well.

Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I'm not in a hurry to buy back in.  This bump could be from people covering their short positions to lock in their profits.

Need some marketing effort to expand the market then I guess?  And make buying easier for more people, maybe see if we can make borrowing for purchases easier.

How fast will the price rise?  Does the block size impact how fast Bitcoin value goes up?  Bought Bitcoin and Ether recently.  I've been saving for new car and house, but I don't think I really need those and there's no good place to put he money.  Looking into borrowing against car and 401k.  But maybe there are better ways to borrow.  Like through an exchange maybe which I read is a thing while lurking.  Seems like BTC price just needs to grow faster than interest rate on the loan to make profit?

I guess I'm just counting on enough people in the market to be greedier than I am.  I figure it's not a bad bet to make with the news cycle about price increases and since cryptocurrencies are so easy to buy these days.  If the growth rate of price falls below the highest interest rate on loans people are holding for prolonged period, I figure that's the time to get out.

I don't trust myself enough to not lose the private key or get hacked.  I also don't want fiddling around waiting for confirmations when I make purchases.  I've read and seen people's experience in using cryptocurrencies and I figure it's too much hassle.

I guess?  I just want to make money off of it, mostly.  I've been reading about it and hesitating.  Got sick of thinking about it so jumped in.  But it's not like I'm going to use it other than buying and selling on exchange.

Yeah if the price doesn't go back up soon I'll be selling.  I'm sure there are people who went into CC debt to buy BTC.  Don't want to be caught in the cascade.  Who knows the distribution of debt amounts over interest rate.
