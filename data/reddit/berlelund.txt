Yeah but what I'm asking is: why would a miner bother to include transactions without any fees into a block?
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:40:09
I highly disagree. Bitcoin is one big game of incentives.
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:35:49
Sorry, I'm not quite sure what you are talking about?
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:30:29
But why did the miners include transactions without any fees in the beginning if they gained nothing?

Why should merchant prefer this to btcpay?

You want to make a bet? Where I get odds at 1000?

Nothing is set in stone yet, but yeah it's the plan to wait on signature aggregation. It needs a lot more testing plus there's a lot of improvement coming which is affecting how sig aggregation will behave therefore it'll have to wait.
That's not to say that multisig aggregation will not come in this update. The difference is whether the sig aggregation is over one or more inputs.

Could wasabi wallet in the future add a feature where people could close their Lightning network channels (not necessarily opened in the wasabi wallet, but a 3rd party wallet) directly in a CoinJoin organized by wasabi?
Is neutrino implemented in wasabi today?

Thanks for the answer! Are there any advantages by using the 2016 blocks adjustment over a dynamic adjustment after each block?
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:42:57
Would increasing the block limit to 4mb have the same effect on the workload as decreasing the block time to 2,5 min?
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:52:45
Would their be any reason to do this (asking merely out of curiosity, because I do not know any)?
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:50:00
So the difficulty change every 14 days is to balance the difficulty so that a block will be discovered on average every 10 min?
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:38:40
Thanks for the great explanation! But I do not quite understand/know what orphan blocks are. Do you have some good links to read up on this or could you possibly explain it?
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:49:41
But when will it be possible for the transaction from address B to address C to be included in a block?
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:50:57
Do you know the reason for this?
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:51:42
Great, thanks:)

So basically it functions like this:
Before a miner can confirm the 2. Tx. They have to have a block in their ledger which contains the 1. tx? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:16:28
I'm not technical on a level like that but I'll give it a try��
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:53:45
But as far as I understand, the adjustment every 2016 blocks is to adjust the difficulty of the blocks so a block is created ever 10 min on average. How is this arbitrary?
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:52:22
So the transaction from address B to address C can be included in the next block from the block with the transaction from address A to address B?
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:56:32
But that would also be the case for me if bch increased the block size to 1tb while still kept the 10 min?
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:47:36
On the first read I thought it was way too confusing for me. But after some research on deviation etc. And will definitely give it a try (when I have the time, later today or maybe tomorrow)
Maybe you could help me out with some links to where I can find the last 10.000 blocks etc?
