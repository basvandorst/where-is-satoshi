There really aren't any BCH supporters who understand Bitcoin and believe that either the 21 million coin cap should be increased or that security should be weakened. They want Bitcoin to maximize its value as both a store of value (gold) and as a medium of exchange (cash).

For all those speculating on which crypto or kind of crypto Cohn is talking about you have to understand that this guy likely believes in the state's entitlement over the control of money. Therefore, he's not talking about a cryptocurrency at all. 
Cohn's use of 'cryptocurrency' in this sense is a euphemism for 'digital currency that we control'. In other words, 'Distributed Ledger Technology' or some other popular buzzword to throw people off. 
It's all about control. He's probably talking about some BS digital currency issued by the IMF and backed by the 'full faith and credit' of it's member countries. They'll tout it as enviro-friendly and not a waste of energy like other evil cryptos.
They are grasping at straws. They are desperate and the smartest of them know its over. Cohn on the other hand isn't that smart.

This deflationary death spiral theory is old, tired and wrong. There is no magical 'unhealthy' or 'healthy' inflation rate.

@_date: 2018-06-02 19:33:50
They use fiat as currency but I'm talking about money. Money is a store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Gold and Bitcoin can become money. Fiat has no chance. Fiat can never be a store of value because human nature will prevent central banks from creating more of it every time there is a financial crisis. In the long run the value of gold and Bitcoin has, and will continue, to outperform fiat.

Opinion Monetary policy
Central banks should consider giving people money
In the past, central banks set the price of money using interest rates. In the future, it seems, they will be giving it away. This week the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25 per cent.
The chairman of the Fed, Jay Powell, did an admirable job of presenting it as business as usual. But the world of central banking is entering uncharted and potentially treacherous territory. The next phase will require great political skill and intellectual bravery.
With interest rates currently positive, the US looks like an anomaly. In the eurozone, Switzerland, Japan and Scandinavia, official interest rates are negative. Considering the fact that in past recessions the Fed has reduced interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage points, this prospect may not be far away for the US, too.
The very idea of negative interest rates is confusing to most people, and many economists believe that the effects are counter-productive. Central bankers are quick to point out that they have developed a range of tools since the 2008 crisis, with technocratic and inelegant names such as “forward guidance” and “quantitative easing”.
These involve attempts to reduce interest rates. Forward guidance aims to keep interest rates low for longer, and QE is an attempt to use asset purchases to reduce the interest rate on government debt, which is a reference point for long-term borrowing by the private sector. Either way, the problem is the same. When interest rates are already this low, further reductions are ineffective.
So where next for monetary policy? One option is to pass the baton to the fiscal authorities. Last week, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, suggested as much, stating that it was “unquestionable” that fiscal measures would be required if the eurozone economy deteriorates further. Olaf Scholz, the German finance minister, promptly poured cold water on his suggestion. Imminent support from fiscal policy looks like wishful thinking.
If interest rates are a spent force, and finance ministries unreliable partners, who will save the day? And how, if the current global trade recession turns into something more pernicious? Three novel proposals are gaining support, all of which involve giving people money.
The first, which literally involves central banks posting cheques to households, is detailed in a superb new book, The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing by the economist Frances Coppola. The logic is compelling. The Australian government sent households money during the financial crisis, and Australia avoided recession. Under Ms Coppola’s proposals, the central bank would finance the transfers by creating electronic money, as it does with QE. One problem with this common sense idea is its simplicity, which rarely appeals to economists charged with taking important decisions. Another challenge is legal and administrative. Certainly in the US and UK, such a policy would probably require new legislation, although not in the eurozone. So far, only the Czech central bank has been indicated it might adopt this policy if and when the next recession strikes. Innovation often comes from surprising sources.
Another policy, already being practised by the Bank of Japan, and recently advocated by a fund manager at the investment firm, BlackRock, is that central banks consider giving money to the owners of the stock market by buying equities. Unsurprisingly, many balk at the idea that shareholders are the most deserving beneficiaries of central bank largesse. A more benign take is that higher equity prices would encourage firms to increase investment spending.
The most intriguing and practically viable idea of all is emerging from the least likely of sources, the ECB: so-called targeted long-term refinancing operations. In straightforward terms, this is a policy of dual interest rates which involves giving money to both borrowers and savers.
In contrast to the other monetary innovations adopted since the crisis, dual interest rates are almost certain to raise spending and economic activity. How do they work? In any economy, there are two interest rates that really matter to households: the interest rate at which they borrow and the rate they are paid on their savings. One of the problems with reducing interest rates, and with negative interest rates in particular, is that households suffer a decline in interest income on savings.
So what if the central bank decides to reduce the interest rate that borrowers have to pay on loans and raises the interest rate households receive on their savings? The ECB’s programme provides the means to do precisely this. They can cut the interest rate on which they lend to banks, subject to these loans being extended to the private sector, and they can raise the interest rate paid on deposits. The evidence from economic history, and simple logic, suggests that if you boost household income in this way economies will recover.
If the eurozone economy continues to weaken significantly, Christine Lagarde, the incoming ECB president, will face an interesting set of choices. She could have the best of all possible jobs — giving people money. But institutional resistance to simple, transparent and direct monetary solutions appears to be such, that in doing so, she will also face the greatest political challenge of her career.

Yes but keep in mind that during the GFC when the collateral had very little market value those mortgages were bought by the Federal Reserve from the commercial banks at full value. They suspended mark-to-market accounting. In this sense money was created out of thin air by the Fed to pay for assets which no one else valued. The vast amount of money that the Fed created to buy those mortgages still sits on their balance sheet.
@_date: 2019-06-09 00:22:50
40% of the Fed's balance sheet is MBS. How can they taper and sell those MBS without having a negative impact on the market? QT is ending long before many thought it would because rates were rising too quickly. I don't see how this cycle doesn't continue indefinitely.

1. Taxpayers who owned a coin that was subject to a Hard Fork in 2017 would
be treated as having realized the forked coin resulting from the Hard Fork in a
taxable event.
2. The deemed value of the forked coin at the time of the realization event would
be zero, which would also be the taxpayer’s basis in the forked coin.
3. The holding period in the forked coin would start on the day of the Hard Fork.
4. **Taxpayers choosing the safe harbor treatment as set forth in the guidance
would be required to disclose this on their tax returns.**
5. The Service would not assert that any taxpayer who availed themselves of the
safe harbor treatment as set forth in the guidance has understated federal tax
liability because of the receipt of a forked coin in a 2017 Hard Fork.
6. The Service, with input from the Section and other stakeholders, will continue
to develop its position regarding the tax treatment for future Hard Forks, and
such position may be different from the one noted above and will apply
While the Section has not concluded that this is the proper U.S. federal income
tax treatment of Hard Forks, we believe that such temporary solution represents a
reasonable interpretation of current law. In addition, we believe that the temporary
solution imposes a reasonable administrative burden on the Service and compliance
burden on taxpayers in this filing season, as it avoids difficult timing and valuation
issues.25 It also minimizes the ability of taxpayers to benefit from hindsight depending
on how the values fluctuated during 2017. **Finally, by requiring disclosure, the Service
will obtain valuable information about cryptocurrency transactions and taxpayers
participating in them.**

I believe that regulators and other officials are concerned that approval of a 'real ETF' like the Winkelvoss's which requires actual purchase and delivery of bitcoins has the potential of creating a huge BTC price spike with unknown consequences on the broader financial markets.

What would happen is that the blocksize cap would be raised until it became evident that there was some sort of technical limitation or a concern regarding the possibility of centralization and risk to censorship resistance. These latter risks may either be realized ahead of time or through other metrics like a falling exchange rate. Miners acting in their own self-interests and to maximize their current and future revenue would take necessary actions to fix the problem. I remember when many were freaking out about 51% mining attacks yet the system self-corrected. I'm confident the same would be done again with respect to blocksize.
