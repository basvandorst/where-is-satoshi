Money laundering is a serious issue to the banking business, some banks have to report ML information to government, I hope this is not the case.

You must be my friend, at least we have the same thoughts :)

My buddy's back, what a drama :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:32:09
Let's don't call it pyramid scheme, pyramid game sounds better :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:39:19
And one thing western people don't know is ordinary Chinese are not able to open an account from foreign bank, and banks in HongKong are all foreign banks to them, just sad :(
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:24:16
:) If this those officials don't get their job done, some people will have to find a new job.

Basically it said that the 4th exchanger in China falls, it will be closed soon. All users have been asked to take out their coins, that's all, don't worry :)

Why people think price stability is a good thing for now. The selling point of Bitcoin is that it will reach moon in the near future. If price stay $500 for next 20 or 30 years, how people make quick money from it? 
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:12:04
One day one Bitcoin will be worth more than one million dollars, so $350 to $550 don't make any different :) 
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:08:17
Why not, if I'm a cartel, I'll put my money in Bitcoin for sure :)

I don't get why this news over here, is there anything related to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:21:01
I think you might misunderstand a little bit. Those Chinese Bitcoiners are speculators (99%?), they are not going to spend coins, they just want to make a quick cut. If you read Chinese Bitcoin forum, nobody talked about spending coins or any Chinese business to accept coins, that's the problem.
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:39:27
 if they came from infected machines, they might already sent to somewhere, everything else you did after that just didn't make sense.

Bitcoin honeymoon is done, reality is not that cool :) off course
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:54:17
If some major banks fail to do it, that's really bad. I personally think Bitcoin business is kind of danger or high risk business, how much a bank can get from this business? Banker don't shoot their feet :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:45:42
That sounds not too bad :) But how many people can do this?
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:32:09
Wow, this is really nice, best one for today :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:53:08
But why it has to be based on Bitcoin? If some countries are not Bitcoin friendly, then they don't do business in those country?

My guest is that some Chinese will sell out their coins before everything halt over there, all the rest Chinese will put their coins simply under bed, that is. It will be really quiet then.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:38:31
There's no way to do without middleman, kind of sad, but it's the reality.

@_date: 2014-04-08 20:15:40
To tell you the truth, when I saw price up to 1200$ from 400$ in a couple months, that's the moment. Speculation drivers me nuts :) No lie.

@_date: 2014-04-25 13:43:28
Nobody bans Bitcoin, come on :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:25:02
If we keep talking about this, sounds like we are talking about a schema, nobody was forced to join a schema, it's fair too :)

I'll bet with you on "there will always be a way for you to get the yuan out of the exchanges (vouchers, ATM, middlemen, whatever)" :)

Not able to withdrawal RMB soon, so no dumping gonna happen in China, we're going to moon :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:59:56
If I have a coin in my wallet, why can't I clone the wallet multiple times, and reuse those wallets on site, since I know there'll be no confirmation :)
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:22:02
I bet none of you guys ever have a account in any of Chinese banks, international wire transfer is a joke for most of the Chinese citizens :(
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:12:09

High risk should get back some high return, but unfortunately our Bitcoin is not able to make banks more rich :( That's not our purposes.

Call IRS desk service, just tell them what happened and your concern, check that number with them, just do it, no hurts.

I was so enjoy to watch it, better than a movie :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:32:37
This is sad, Bitcoin works right in this scenario by designed.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:16:37
No, I wouldn't.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:47:30
I don't believe this :(
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:30:35

We need more people like him, seriously :) otherwise, it will never reach there :)

Haha, you guys are too smart to understand this, happy Friday :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:30:34
Who made this decision, send him a couple coins would you?
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:55:52
Have you ever tried Google translator? You liar, you'll have a bigger nose, Haha :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:04:42
Come on man, 'you seriously you fail', that's a woman told me :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:02:18
In his statement, Kander misinterpreted the fundamental function of digital currencies like bitcoin, likening them to “Investments that are sold as a way to make a quick profit,” and adding “I encourage Missourians to be wary of any investments that promise an unusually quick return."
I think you should change "misinterpreted" to "interpreted", different people have different views, how are you so sure he "misinterpreted". What he said is quite legit.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:46:54
Why do we need this news :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:09:37
What about the existing exchanges? run off with our coins? :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:36:52
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin :(
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:12:34
I like this "*All signs points to the moon!!!*", that's my dream :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:33:24
So how did you get your coins? or where?
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:07:01
Usually I don't believe Bitcoin is a joke, but this is one of the time I can prove myself. Ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:20:06
It has to be some good news, what's that?
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:37:46
I know this is coming again, and it will repeat again :( :)
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:35:42
Can you withdraw all your money from your bank account, I think you can also ask bank to freeze your account.
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:54:05
This pyramid idea is just great, it happened a lot before in China :) amazing
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:49:52
Nice :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:39:49
I'm curious too, there's no reason to see this selling power :(
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:30:18
I don't think you have enough time to do this, seriously?
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:26:09
Resolves what, is Bitcoin reversible?
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:54:17
That pic looks like a customer service lady answering question online, basically she said 3 major banks in China:
Bank of China, Industry Bank, Commerce Bank 
are closing Bitcoin business after Apr 7, then the guy ask what about other banks, she ignored the question :(
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:02:04
I don't have nothing for now :) price will go somewhere for sure.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:30:26
It's possible to mine other coins, I guess :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:43:50
Come on man, is this really real?

When other companies start to accept FaceBucks or Googlios, you know who gonna get really really pissed off. This is the exactly reason why all the virtual moneys got killed in one night in China. Current Bitcoin market size is nothing to compare the virtual money market.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:34:45
Is it only me feel funny :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:32:23

@_date: 2014-04-17 15:47:22
I know it's sarcasm, but sometimes only check is acceptable.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:18:19
We all serious :) it takes time
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:37:01
Everybody will run out options, no banks, no 3td parties, no 充值码, no ATM, what else they can do :)

Sometimes you just can not say the truth even you know it, not even to your lover :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:38:01
To tell you the truth, 99% Chinese are just speculators, maybe western people are better, I'm not sure. Good theory is only for other people.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:38:16
Not everybody know how to write a check :) We must have a lot of kids on this subreddit

@_date: 2014-04-09 15:16:24
Nab bank sounds like a Chinese bank, just kidding. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:00:42
No, it wouldn't. The worst scenario I can guess is that speculators are unable to get cut from Bitcoin, eventually they will leave and turn to something else, then the price will drop. If more and more people leave, then Bitcoin becomes a toy, people do it just for fun. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:45:24
It said all by Apr 7, but it doesn't matter, price wouldn't go anywhere, people are so get to use to it :) I hope Chinese wouldn't dump their coins :(
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:48:33
Haha, this is pure FUD :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:51:27

I used to work in banking industry, some people think one bank maybe better than another one, that's just not true. Before you guys switch off a bank, talk to them first. When you go to a new bank, you may get a question "what happened to ..."
AML is a huge issue not only for wealth management, but also applying to retail banking. Bankers just want to cover their asses, they don't make more money if your account stay.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:21:07

Marriage counselors understand all the relationship theories, but sometimes they get themselves divorced too.

@_date: 2014-04-09 18:40:45
3 major banks :(
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:12:26
I'll use my coin to buy a ticket to land on moon too, I'm not coming back :) We use Bitcoin only over there.
@_date: 2014-04-27 15:51:00
A lot of people have nothing to do with Bitcoin. You may call it bitcoin, other people may call it buttcoin/shitcoin, why do they want your shitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:12:54
Wow, a wizard at Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:52:29
I really enjoy watch this subreddit, it's definitely better that sometimes you'll get some deep level sense of humors :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 13:26:22
"Replacing the current legal system IS coming." Are you seriously?
Why don't you talk to a doctor first before you type something like that.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:23:12
Absolutely impossible :) come on man
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:10:52
Speculators love Bitcoin :) Early adapters need more new adapters to make a cut :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:46:00
We got a rich man here, you got hold it to save my ass :)
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:25:31
I feel BTC-e might be the first, that's just my own guess :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:57:05
This is make my day, I like Russians :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:29:51
Unfortunately, sometimes it is :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:46:01
But still, even without a single buy wall, there's no reason price hit $300, that's ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:19:58
We were talking about do WITHOUT CONFIRMATION :) Send only
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:32:23
Communism is to not only want to upset but also want to remove many (corrupt) governments and financial institutions, so how close are these 2 things :)
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:55:18
Real show will be started in hours, I hope guys get ready to buy cheap :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:56:25
Haha, I got my new password: Tits for Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:22:47
The last 2 checks I did were for my kid, those girls booked a house beside school. I was told: one for first month, one for last month, no cash :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:03:58
it's right :) you said: fxxxing bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:06:13
MD got be a good place to live
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:59:48
I want to know if price hit 200$ before hit 2000$ or hit 2000$ before hit 200$, which one is better :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:46:17
Hope no dumping happens. I sure a lot of Chinese Bitcoiners are pure speculators, the only thing they believe is to make quick big money. If they can not make money from Bitcoin, they will be gone for another speculation :(
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:12:39
been silent about 11 days.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:06:21
agree :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:44:14
Haha, a fresh clean new cloned virtual machine is much more safer than host machine, I'll drop the virtual machine right way once I finished, probably in 3 to 5 minutes.
Edit: But I have to say, there just no 100% secure way for security, anybody says it just being naive.
Even we are using virtual machine, the keyboard might be monitored by a host daemon, and for Linux Tails way, I'm not trust those people behind of it 100%.
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:11:40
Mt.Gox will be back again? What a drama :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:59:29
Keeping money in the bank is safer, although money may lost its value, but it wouldn't disappear suddenly :) 
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:03:32
This centralized virtual money systems used to run very well in China, people loved to use it, simply use your cellphone to pay, so convenient, eventually even dollar shops started to accept it. So at one night, government killed them all. That's the real story :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:12:59
Bitcoin is a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object :) This is not too bad
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:52:55
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:41:03
I read Chinese. Whether or not FUD is not important any more, guys, just move on :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:33:55
Haha, please don't :)
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:44:49
It depends on with country :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:06:38
Absolutely right, it's good time to buy, once tomorrow price reach $500 again, you can make a cut right away, so simple :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:43:38
To be honest, I have the exact same feeling :) There will be things we just can't imagine right now :) Also some people must behind Bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:07:04
I don't think he's new :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:22:01
Then you are, no kidding :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:20:21
There is NO 100% secure way to keep your coins. If your machine got penetrated, when you try to create keys or import coins, everything maybe got logged and sent to somewhere. How many people can say my machine will never got penetrated?
When I have to do some secure stuff, I'll clone a fresh clean virtual machine with new IP, after finish whatever I do, I drop the machine right way. Using Linux Tails is not a bad idea too.
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:05:47
But still a cult, right :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:09:53
Have much to get a money order, how much the cost to write a check?
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:46:37
Sad man, dream and reality are different things, realities are always brutal, but nothing can be changed.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:10:17
Virtual money like this: if you have a reddit account, then you can buy some reddit's own virtual money, then you can buy any goods selling on reddit website.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:19:57
Of course :) Bitcoin is not centralized, so it's not that easy to get killed. Now PBOC is trying to cut all the links with Bitcoin, eventually Bitcoin has to run underground in China.
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:52:13
Now I got the trick :) I'll reuse my old coin on site to buy something small, it may work :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:27:15
I guess I have to have a drink, have you guys ever tried Chinese spirits, some of them contain 40% alcohol only :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 12:44:55
Come on guys, just move on.
I think people sometimes forget what Bitcoin is about :)
When we are happy, we say screw the government, screw the banks and screw a lot thing else, but when we got screwed ourselves, we are crying for class action, what are you guys talking about?  
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:10:13
What entire protocol? all the e-currencies from China were centralized, of course the entire e-currency protocols got shut down, show me where are they right now!
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:47:56
Come on, we have enough news today :) FUD?
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:34:45
What would a $100,000 Gold do to the economy? not too much :)
I find it's fascinating that people keep talking about Bitcoin value in a funny way. When $1000,000 Bitcoin happens, it may only worth 10 Big Macs, what's the point we keep talking about this nonsense. If you ever think a $100,000 Bitcoin is able to buy 10,000 Big Mac, that's just delusion.
Who can convince Bill Gates that if he doesn't convert his fiat money to Bitcoin, one day he's wealth will shrink 100,000 times?
Do you guys really believe the most richer people in the future have to be Bitcoiners? Don't you think it's funny?
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:49:41
Very close or kind of close :) actually, a lot of things are similar in these 2 theories, just think about it :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:00:10
The wording of the Chinese statement are so mad, haha.
If a bank official got 约谈 from PBCO, it means one step to lose his job.
接着跟政府玩，看你还能玩多久 :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 01:09:05
Don't you remember all e-currencies had been banned before in China, no company is allowed sell "unit" now in China.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:37:00
I see, thank you, it helps :)
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:36:03
They will
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:02:43
Haha, I know about 20 IT contractors in download area, no one has any coins, you must say we all ... :) we do have a lot of fun to talk about Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:40:31
We need good news :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:20:33
So who made Gambit site? another 17 year old kid?
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:08:18
I think Chinese exchanges will have to shut themselves off soon, after that Chinese take no effect on Bitcoin, we'll be ready to lunch to moon :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:06:56
The problem is there are just too many speculators in Bitcoin domain, people just want short and blah blah ... :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:19:01
Watching and waiting, that's everybody doing :( We need real good news to drive the price up.
@_date: 2014-04-08 19:13:12
I agree with the rich and male parts, but for the white part, a lot of male chinese do it too :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:04:22
Oh yah :)
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:53:47
So BoA is a piece of shit, let's dump it, that's the solution :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:31:21
Just give people chance to buy cheap, that's all :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:08:18
What's the benefit for US government to engage BTC. BTC stronger, US dollar weaker. You know US Dollar is the real weapon for US government, if this weapon be disabled, US will lose its power.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:11:37
$420 is important, if price goes under it, I don't know what gonna happen.
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:01:44
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:05:18
So Facebook is creating it's own virtual money, that's interesting :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:28:17
So how do you get this number?
@_date: 2014-04-22 23:41:04
Haha, ya right, one step to be closed :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:29:00
Haha, downvote to hell, sometimes you just don't tell the truth, not even to your girlfriend :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:20:04
What about Google, if one day you can pay from cellphone by Google dollar simple and fast, what you gonna say?
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:37:01
'get-rich quick' and 'get-poor quick' are twin brothers, some times people just can not figure out which one is which one :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:37:24
It really is :) he's a nice troll 
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:40:39
First illegal drugs, then porn industry, what else :) forgot this one: Ransom business
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:04:32
It really don't matter :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:12:57
Google Chinese translator must be implemented by a non-Chinese :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:48:07
Absolutely no way. Worst scenario maybe $200, that's it :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:23:40
So how do I go to bed :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:20:21
Don't be mad man, I understand you :) I can see the light. People only learn a lesson when they get screwed.
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:59:20
Price will reach $650 first :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:36:37
You got it man :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:10:19
Do you like to watch drama? I used to have to pay for it :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:15:11
Translation for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th pic:
My question:have you guys got the new notice? will not handle Bitcoin business any more?
Customer Service  yes
My question: Is this about business account or personal account? all of the bitcoin related account have to be closed? From all the Merchants Bank branches? No exceptions at all?
Customer Service  From theory, it is.
My question: what is from theory? any exception?
Customer Service  I'm very sorry, I'm not very clear the detail notice, can you confirm with your branch.
My question: if account got closed, is that mean can not put in money and can not withdraw money? Or only means can not put in? withdraw still OK?
Customer Service  none of them will be available (or not possible)
My question: if using my personal account from another bank, and transfer money to Merchants Bank (this bank) bitcoin business account, is it ok not to close this business acccount?
Customer Service  hi, direct and in-direct are all banned,
My question: if I don't tell this business account is for bitcoin business, but I actually do it, will this business account be closed?
Customer Service  yes
My question: if I do personal account to personal account, is that ok?
        我们收到文件就是停止所有相关的业务呀
Customer Service  it should not be ok
                                   What we have got the notice says: stop all of bitcoin related business
My question: have all the banks received this notice yet?
      
Customer Service  my bank (China Merchants Bank) have received it
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:54:14
Forget about China, Rusia and US, Bitcoin will make peace somewhere else :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:25:48
We got a mad man :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:57:50
Are you saying Bitcoin is a good cult :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:03:44
Whoever buys today, you are my hero, no kidding :)
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:56:25
It's kind of weird different people have same thought :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:06:24
holy shit, I'll call them stop :) I will
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:35:18
My line always works, you'll see :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:14:15
I see, that's the problem for some countries.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:16:45
Niagara never falls :) It doesn't matter what :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:46:04
Bitcoin = Communism :)
Whenever Bitcoiners talking about government, USD, Banks, ... securiously, they just look like communist :)
I bet most of young kids from western countries never see a real communist, haha
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:18:14
When you use a penetrated machine to create this, it's not 100% safe. Even you show this pic, it doesn't mean nobody else got your money, still: Nothing is 100% safe.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:51:16
Hope it's real :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:29:25
Haha, 善有善报，恶有恶报，不是不报，时候未到，时候一到，一切全报。
接着玩，看你们还能玩多久 :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:13:08
There's only one Chimese forums over here 
They are all speculators, sometimes I go there to see what they are talking about when a FUD coming.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:28:39
Money paid
In December 2013 ZDNet traced four Bitcoin addresses posted by users who had been infected by CryptoLocker, in an attempt to gauge the operators' takings. The four addresses showed movement of 41,928 BTC between October 15 and December 18, about US$27 million at that time.
This definitely makes Bitcoin great :(
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:43:16
haha, what the $$$$ :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:13:05
Another goxxing coming? cough
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:04:51
:) please
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:22:12
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:53:26
Haha, this is too much, people need a good long weekend :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:16:43
Thank you :) I'm still learning how to write.
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:51:29
Banks stop doing Bitcoin business :( Actually I don't get why would a bank like this business.
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:52:07
If you use a penetrated computer to create an offline wallet, you fail :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:14:12
Wait for cheaper :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:08:48
Come on, I haven't see this "doomed" word for a while. Drama will never stop, Bitcoin will never die :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:34:21
Forget China or don't worry about China. China is another world, like Mars, that's what I'm thinking. We have to live by our own :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 15:58:05
That's your option :) Have your girlfriend ever told you "that's your option" :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:51:36
I do hope you got those coins long time ago. I'm so sad :(
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:47:47
What do you guys want to prove? Are we bunch of low level ..., this is so dirty, and so low, only kids or phyco doing this, come on :(
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:13:04
I see, thank you. But this is just a dirty trick, I'll tell the guy that your money has to be in my account for more than a day :) does this work?
@_date: 2014-04-26 22:05:22
Halting withdrawals, so nobody can sell, no dumping gonna happen, great news, to the moon :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:59:29
Haha, I didn't do it, don't be too mad bro :) I just gave a up
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:35:40
Guest which one gonna fall first :)
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:57:47
If Google takes Bitcoin, then we'll be on the moon soon :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:41:02
something like facebook/google dallor or point, you can buy these virtual money from these companies, then use their virtual money shopping on their web, other companies may support their virtual money once market getting big :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:26:14
What I'm thinking is that the Bitcoin booming might be just caused by speculators, the booming is not real, once speculators left, you may see the real face of Bitcoin, I'm not sure the real face is beautiful :( 
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:41:09
China is not a chicken :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 19:42:32
:) don't tell nobody
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:05:30
Goxings will never stop, it will happen again and again.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:48:31
sarcasm :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:19:21
Its bank account will be closed soon, very soon, how do you withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:00:10
Merchants wouldn't help the price, we need more people buy and hold :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:35:56
Thank you, this really makes me happy :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:18:05
I got your points. One thing I'm sure, my mom wouldn't use it, and my dad wouldn't use it neither :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:03:39
Haha, this is so Chinese way, I feel shame on ourselves, we don't get enough respect as a enemy from China.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:03:49
This is day dream, why don't dream to date a movie star :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:22:53
This is too much :)
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:39:43
Whoever said price is going up soon should take a look this chart, how could that happen :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:25:15
Is 'seismic shock’ sarcasm? I don't like it :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:01:41
Reddit is banned in mainland China, I leave somewhere else :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:23:47
How do you figure out this one "99% of people on this planet already use bitcoin", you must be a nice troll :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:42:22
Then you misunderstand China government, you better think it as an axxhxxx, they don't like any currencies except Chinese Yuan and US Dollar.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:29:32
You will get for sure :)
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:15:30
Do we have to talk about the moon thing today?
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:02:42
Come on man :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:26:53
Come on man, don't do this :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:25:59
Great, so where do I put my coins :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:36:58
You said it right man :) Nobody is banning Bitcoin, they just don't want Chinese banks involve in it, that's all :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:24:30
This is so call the virtual money, all virtual moneys have been killed literally in China :) Good luck.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:30:37
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:25:21
So how do you transfer your coins to that pi?
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:41:52
back to my line again, happy :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:55:33
Smart dude :) Bless you :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:25:15
A paper Bitcoin wallet in your wallet?
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:59:37
I never heart China has Suicide Hotlines, correct me if I'm wrong :( Chinese need it more.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:12:48
Off course PBOC Won't Ban Bitcoin, PBOC just Ban banks doing Bitcoin business. Thant's all he saying :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:08:25
good, dream is not a bad thing :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:21:49
Listen to me please, find a nice girl friend, you will understand what I'm saying :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:27:37
What about this one :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:30:52
Sarcasm :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:10:32
I think you forget to tell how those virtual currencies got killed eventually, that's the real fun part :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:58:33
in the middle:
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:15:45
So gox us again ? Come on
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:28:45
Who knows?
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:06:31
Great, you the man.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:38:40
Great :( I keep saying people don't understand Chinese :)
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:58:13
This Facebuck thing may go well in the future. For example, if you own a store and have a facebook account, I can pay you through Facebuck by using my cellphone, how convenient it will be :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:59:23
Surprisingly most my checks I wrote are for my daughter in university, there must be a lot of universities accepting Bitcoin :)
