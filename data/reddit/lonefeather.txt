Any guess as to how much BitPay paid for the naming rights?
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:57:33
PATENT THIS IMMEDIATELY!  Great invention!  But yeah, protect yo'self.

Look at giving a serious answer to OP's question... What a nerd! 
(But srsly, that's a pretty good idea.)

What just happened? Did Mr. Nakamoto just reply to another post accidentally? Good for you for responding in kind :)

Honest question: Why shouldn't I be buying now more than ever?
All the recent bad news about oil prices plunging and China's growth faltering and the Fed rates rising, and now more and more, the U.S. bubble bursting, reminds me of the old saying "Buy when everyone else is selling." I know that's advice for a very particular scenario that doesn't quite apply here, but with all this pessimism and advice to sell, why shouldn't I be buying now?
I get that the numbers support the conclusion that we're in a "post"-Recession bubble that's about to burst. But if all the key players know this and have been selling accordingly, doesn't that mean that prices should be "un-inflated" (or just "flated" -- I wouldn't go so far as to say they're "deflated") and that the burst won't be as bad as is being predicted?
Like I said, honest question. Please don't lynch me.

Holy shit no way?  Really?  That's such a weird formatting rule to force.  Some reddit dev was all "NONE OF THAT OUTDATED DOUBLE-SPACE BULLSHIT ON ***MY*** INTERNET THANKYOUVERYMUCH." 
edit: and yes, to anyone else wondering, reddit does indeed strip out the extra spaces, as I just found out in this post. Although strangely enough they're still here in the editor, just not showing up in the post.

Haha, thanks for the transparency! Good on ya. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 15:26:47
Ah, did not know that, thanks. So one of the original HTML devs hated spaces? :D
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:22:48
Good reminder, thanks. So, in other words, if I buy the key players' shares that they're selling, I'm betting against them and their expertise. Is that accurate?

I had the same trouble with Coinbase's verification system, too.  But someone else here on recommended that you make sure to check your *address* on the *first* page of the verification webpages.  I changed my address from " to "APT 123" and it magically worked after that!  Good luck!
