Well I admit that the 2 hours deadline is harsh. We didn't give any deadlines, we leave that to the people directly in contact with the clients. And AFAIK, never gave a single deadline to anyone. Just justify the transaction and everyone's happy.
I don't like the lack of privacy and control as much as you do, hence the reason I decided to go nearly full crypto rather than depend on fiat. Seen and heard too much to stomach.

Depending on your case. Are those $100 regular cash deposits? Daily? Weekly? On specific dates or irregular dates? Do they know if you're on welfare or not?  
Are they coming in electronically from an account that has been previously flagged for suspicious behavior?
The problem here is there are too many variables to consider. Who are you? Why are you receiving the $100 when they know that you don't have a paycheck from a regular job?  
At a glance it's easy to tell if someone works or not, receives paychecks or not. And if that someone suddenly has been making $100 cash deposits out of the blue on a weekly basis, then that's suspicious. Most would just shrug and pass it on, others would want to check.   
The system isn't fail proof, it still needs humans behind it to double, triple check. And there are a lot of false positives to weed out too.

I'm pretty sure your bank are surprised to see something come in from a system they're not used to seeing regularly. It happens, especially with smaller branches...nobody is ever prepared for it at all lol

That explains a lot.
ING are/were idiots. I tried opening an account with them, but when I informed the guy at the time that almost all of my transactions will be crypto-related. He went oh ah hmm...and had to "get back to me"  
Their hesitation was enough to tell me to take my business elsewhere.

I understand your frustrations but here's how we used to do it.
1. Start the day with a cup of coffee (that's extremely important)
2. Check backups, reports from previous shift and update any necessary previous day's work.
3. Check current flags and reports from various departments (depending on the size of the bank, there can be thousands per day).
4. Read M. u/paquitomo's transaction report, bring up financial history. Hmm, nothing suspicious there seems like a regular person to me, ***BUT I'm no expert***. Let's bump it up to those who are and CC anyone who's relevant.
5. Report from the experts come back, M. u/paquitomo's - "Source funds cannot be traced, may be a cryptocurrency transaction." or some such (I'm inventing the actual words but the process remains almost the same everywhere)
6. Have the relationship officer call M. u/paquitomo and inquire about the source of funds and inquire if client has any proof that the funds have been legally obtained. ***Bank will be liable if they allow the funds to go through without fully investigating the source.***
7. If source has been found to be legit, then congrats. Hold on funds removed and appears in account. Otherwise, authorities from your country's tax/justice financial departments will be notified and that's when things start to look bad for you.  
The bank is trying to protect you and itself from the government's wrath, that's all. Your gov is not going to be involved unless the bank asks them to. And trust me, banks have extremely good investigative departments. And they are the ***first line of defense*** against money laundering, not the police.   
  
They're paranoid AF.

Well not to burst your bubble but:
1- There is an int'l agreement to combat money laundering and banks have systems in place that flags any suspicious or fraudulent financial transaction. Banks from known corrupt countries will be automatically flagged under that system along with any unusually high number of precise transactions (think 5x 1mil dropping into an account). Also not to mention organizations that are known or suspected to fund criminal activities.
2- If it's over 10k USD, then they will ask where you got it from and why. Especially if your country has taxes.
Personal experience: I have received a large sum of money from a family member's account abroad. It was immediately flagged and brought to \**drum roll*\* my department's attention. Where my boss realized that this account belonged to me. It was eventually released, but I understand the crazy experience.  
Turns out said family member was donating to a charity that in turn was actually funding criminal activities. He didn't know about the charity, thought it was legit one. Poor dude.  
So I know it must be frustrating but some of these mechanisms are in place to protect the clients. Especially those with a lot to lose.
