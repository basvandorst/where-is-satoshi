I like those odds!

You can heat home's though, could be useful in very cold countries.

Still an asset that must be declared.

He wasnt arrested, his house was raided by the tax office.

While a small amount of bitcoin is required to take advantage of the blockchain as arecord keeper I would not describe that as 'going full bitcoin.'

If bitcoin ever has a chance at destroying USD's reserve status the ruble will have lost it's value to bitcoin already. You don't harm your enemies by harming yourself even more, besides which Russia allowing bitcoin to continue in their country unhindered will have a minimal effect on the global adoption required to supplant USD.

The overwhelming majority.

I don't get it.

It doesn't matter if it's beneficial for the nation as a whole, what you need to ask is it beneficial for those the hold the reigns of power. Being in control of the monetary supply is the most fundamental power one can hold over a nation, adopting a currency you can't control the supply of destroy's that.

Or you could sell and buy again once your confident it's reached a bottom.

It might divorce them form the monopoly but it's not going to remove them from the equation either. If govements iissue their own digital currency then the majority of people will use it for day to day transactions.

Not if he is the subject of criminal proceeding's he can not.
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:09:51
Strange that you associate losing weight with being raped.

Do you even know if that exists in Japan?
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:50:50
That's called a pound sign and denotes the currency used by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The problem is if you wish to trade you have to give your coins over to a third party at some point. That said all the signs of Gox being less than credible were there from the start, the cautious avoided it, those willing to take more of a risk traded some of their coins there and so only got slightly burned and the outright foolish lost entire fortunes. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:38:22
Correct, what he is guilty of is so much worse than theft. At least if it was just theft he could have given what he took back, this is the worse kind of fraud.
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:15:23
There you go again.
@_date: 2015-09-15 06:11:30
No one doing bitcoin trading is going to operate without an escrow though.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:48:00
Scam can still happen through LBC with escrow, it doesn't make a difference, read this.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:38:32
Read my scenario again when I say cash deposit I am talking about a cash deposit at a bank.
@_date: 2015-11-13 05:32:16
In the meantime your bank account gets shut down and a police investigation against you.
@_date: 2015-11-13 09:10:02
It wasn't clear at all, what made it even less clear is the situation he proposed doesn't even make sense.
@_date: 2015-11-13 01:59:38
I was thinking more in regards to using a service like localbitcoins to sell coins.
@_date: 2015-11-20 07:06:55
But they are happy to do so through banks? I don't understand the logic.
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:58:07
Nope the scam can easily happen with cash at a bank to, banks don't check your identity when doing cash deposits and even if they did you are not going to see anything in your bank statement except that the money went into it.
@_date: 2015-11-24 03:51:53
@_date: 2015-11-24 03:57:40
I might add it could be quite useful in a country with a rapidly collapsing currency.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:17:12
No the scam can happen all the same with cash, scammer just asks the guy buying the object to make a cash deposit.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:26:25
You can't see there are two people though the scammer is the only one ever in contact with 2 people that's why it's called a man in the middle scam.
Say the scammer convinces some guy to buy a car for $2000 via cash deposit at a bank, in the meantime he opens up a trade for bitcoin worth $2000 and agrees to pay with cash deposit. He get's the bank details off of the bitcoin trader and passes them on to the guy buying the car as his own, guy buying car put's $2000 into bitcoin traders bank account, bitcoin trader see's the $2000 enter his account thinking it came from the guy running the scam releases the bitcoin and scammer walks away with the coin. Guy buying the car never receives his car so he contacts the bank and the police. From their side of things it looks like you received $2000 without ever selling anything.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:46:22
Wait your talking about meeting in person?
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:55:27
Still not viable for 99% of bitcoin trades which is why people need to be weary of this scam.
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:59:42
I know, it doesn't protect against this scam.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:00:26
Not really viable if you want to make multiple sales a day and are doing so country wide.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:51:33
It wasn't clear at all, all you said was do it at a bank with cash which I thought to mean a cash deposit at a a bank with only one person involved. In your scenario there's not even a need to involve a bank you just need to meet up some place in public, which isn't a viable option for most bitcoin traders because they are trading with people all over the country.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:10:45
No it wouldn't read this.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:06:09
Another person who doesn't understand this scam, the wares in this case is money that you traded for bitcoin, you get the money the scammer get's the bitcoin only problem is the money actually came from a guy buying an item from the scammer who never sent it. This guy then reports it to the police, you end up with a police investigation against you and your bank account get's shut down.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:29:00
I thought that might be the only way to avoid it but even that doesn't seem foolproof, a scammer could in theory demand a receipt from the guy depositing the cash and then photoshop it, I know it seems unlikely but I was just wondering if there are any other method's out there.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:41:16
No it didn't it came from the guy trying to buy the car because the scammer gave the bitcoin sellers bank details to him as his own.
@_date: 2015-11-13 00:18:16
Any advice on how to avoid this scam?
