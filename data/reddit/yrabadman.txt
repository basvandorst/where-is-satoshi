Here's one problem: 4480 tx/s is still not enough for a truely global means of transaction. 
An issue with increased block size is that it (theoretically?) would lead to centralization. 
But the assertion that nobody would run nodes at like.. 16 MB is absurd

BTC is at the forefront of a novel technical revolution. There will be growing pains as society feels out the true value
There are multiple examples of  countries whose currencies have completely collapsed (following days where they dropped massively) so this argument isnt exactly in favor of fiat

Stop burying your fucking head in the sand
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:21:26
Right, that's what literally all the coins marketing materials say though. Why Stellar over Vert? Iota? 
I already want to get out of XRP due to its centrally controlled nature, but I dare not since its likely to be added to coinbase. 
Anyway I guess what Im saying is that XLM doesnt seem to do anything different or better than the dozens of other alts. At least not on the surface
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:30:47
Except that you can use BTC. So whatever the price is at the moment is part of your networth
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:37:22
Hmm a Gbyte shill, never seen one in the wild. I really want to like this alt but its name is absolute trash. And its an Iota competitor with way less brand recognition 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:48:02
Hmm I very much appreciate all that. transaction times are my biggest take away. 
However, lack of smart contracts actually turns me off a bit. I guess they are going for a straight up medium of exchange?
Also XRP is going to POP OFF after coinbase adds it so that last paragraph doesnt mean too much to me. 
Do you hold and XRP? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:48
Get the FUCK off the sub. 
Stop sticking your head in the sand. I've been in this space for years. These fees and transaction times are completely unacceptable 
SegWit didnt fucking solve this. Lightning has no dead line. Meanwhile Btrash has low fees and transaction time
All this was caused by core backing out of the SegWit2X agreement. Which WOULD HAVE solved the issues in the meantime
Because core renegged onthe deal, they forced a contentious hardfork and now both BTC and LTC have to suffer. This is bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:41:55
Im not sure what you're getting at with this analogy because it doesnt really work.

Dude. LITERALLY type your issue into google.
if you cant do that than you shouldnt buy BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:19:40

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:08:59

I mean I also have some (not enough.. never enough) along with all the other mainstream tokens (not DASH or XRP, yuck).
Im just busting your balls. I know BTC has a scaling problem but dammit we're trying
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:58:24
You guys hardforked to return assets. Assets that were willed into existence. Dont act like thats not a big issue
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:08:38
You can only do this because they are unknown and not actually an accepted means of transaction. If they had to scale to BTC levels they'd run into similar problems

I've been preaching the tech for years though. Oh and I used to buy contraband with them so I guess I contributed to the currency aspect. Just dont get the reap the rewards of the hodlers. But that's ok, Im just happy to have been a part of the paradigm shift. It does suck that all my friends and family assume I was hording them though, Im embarrassed to admit the truth

Tell me, what makes you so salty? It's not too late you know. We are at less than 1% adoption. Still in the early adopter phase. 
If you're going to respond with "bubble, MUH TULIPS, speculative, not backed by anything" Then just know that everyone here will laugh at you for your ignorance. 
Why don't you do a bit of research into the crypto space. I dont think you understand the impact that blockchain tech will have on our society, not to mention smart contracts.

Well here's the thing, I DID kindof know. And I always had that nagging feeling in the back of my mind. I literally had $2K in the 2011 that I blew through on drugs instead of heeding my uncles advice and just getting a few. 
More than that, I friend had recently (at the time, again 2011) come into some inheritance money and came to me asking me to help him set up some BTC mining rigs since he was interested in the tech. We had all the parts picked out and ready to ship when he decided to move across the country chasing a girl. hard not to be a bit salty on that one

Its ironic that you call me uneducated; if you were properly educated you could easily parse my comments and see that I'm not a nazi, nor trump supporter, nor alt right. In fact, I've participated in a counter protest of an alt right gathering. What have you done exactly? Left essays on reddit? Fucking pussy. (See what I did there?) Secondly, Nothing I've said in my comment history is racist. I encourage you to point out what you're referring to.

Hmm Mostly correct. Only thing I would add is that one, 1p-LSD is indistinguishable from the usual LSD, trip wise. So I wouldnt really even count that as a different drug really. ALD-52 is more expensive for the most part, since its pretty niche, so unlikely to get that. Other similar psuedo analogues are AL-LAD, ETH-LAD (hah) but again, they are niche and slightly more expensive. Then there's the 2-CBs but most people who get 2-cb went looking for it
What you would have to watch out for is the NBOME family. 25-x (25-I, 25-C, etc). These flooded the market a few years ago and were being pushed as L. They have a more sinister headspace for the most part and their dosage is not well done so people have "OD'd" (freaked out) on them. You can tell if your tab is an NBOME if it tastes bitter or metallic at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:36:58
That's been the case since inception. Only now the voices repeating "bubble" and "tulip bulbs" and "scam" are getting shaky. Our ranks grow everyday. People who mocked me for years are no longer sneering. 
The point is that we are on the cusp of moving out from early adoption. Look at the coinbase signups. Bitcoin and crypto are constantly in the news now. The 10k news will come as a huge milestone to the outside observer.

Its you who is struggling to grasp the concept, not I.
Theres no such thing as a "legitimate currency" If people accept it as a means of exchange (and they do) then thats a currency. 
You're stuck in a traditionalist mindset. Did you know that people made very similar arguments against unpegging the dollar from the gold reserves? And now look, you've named several things backing up the dollar that gold backed supporters couldnt see. Notice any parallels here?
The system is based on the consensus of worth. Much like all currencies are. You dont need a government to tell you how to value your labor or the products / services around you. You're just stuck in your luddite ways
And for the record, BTC is 'backed' by the technology. And yes, there are exchanges for BTC what the fuck are you talking about. Go buy BTC ETFs in europe if you cant wait the the US approval. Futures are coming soon. 
You clearly are talking out of your ass so I dont know how constructive this is going to be. Do some research next time

From their point of view. SegWit and LN are non blockchain layers that comprise the underlying tech. Technically they are a more "pure" form of bitcoin (one that heavily favors centralized mining and doesnt address covert ASIC boost...conveniently)
Also, Bcash is traded as BCC or BCH. So no fraudulence there.
If ETC were to over take ETH, people would start referring to that as Ethereum
This isnt difficult.

I'm 'hating' because if you come into the comment section of this sub and post "How do I buy" when the faq is RIGHT THERE and they clearly got here via search engine, then they shouldn't be buying at all.
If someone is incapable of literally typing their question into google, they shouldn't be investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:47:07
Call me an arrogant idiot then, cause im not paying. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:30:31
I'm under the impression that whenever theres an ETH hack he creates more and gives it back to the people who lost out
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:01:41
Probably. Even If BTC goes to 100K I wont have enough to drop out of the rat race completely. 
Forever a cog in the machine. But I console myself with the vindication that I wasnt crazy. So I've got that
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:51:50
We're already in a bubble. But that's ok. If it bursts I get to buy BTC on sale. In the meantime they keep making me wealthier. I can't lose

Calling everyone who disagrees with you a trump voter (or nazi, but what's the difference am I right?)
You brought trump upon yourselves, and, in turn, the rest of us. Now we all get to suffer through a trump presidency because of liberal hubris and their unjustified, smug sense of superiority. So thanks for that. I can see you haven't learned a god damn thing. 
It is pseudo cuckoldry to allow an element of undesirables to co-opt an innocuous form of expression. They took something from the public at large and claimed ownership over it when it wasnt theirs. This isnt a tough concept. Although you don't have a great track record with lightly abstracted reasoning so far
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:46:27
Yes. People have bought houses and lambos with bitcoin. Its kind of a meme at this point
When you do a bank transfer, you send a series of 1s and 0s in order to send the funds from one party to another. This is the same concept, except without the middleman. Oh and it cant be fraudulent 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:47:08
If you're keen to learn you need to look elsewhere.
This guy is spewing verbal diarrhea
Here's an actual, fair, volatility chart 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:57:02
Haha yeah that actually blows my mind. Sure, go ahead and spend hours stressing yourself out trying to figure out where you made gains and where you took losses on trades just so you can snitch on yourself and give big big daddy IRS even more of your lunch money.
Fuck that shit. They can get themselves some quantium computers and run blockchain analysis and bill me what I owe if they want to, but otherwise they're not seeing one fucking bit out of me.
Fucking statists
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:07:43
And why do you think the implementation of such an algorithm might be useful / valuable for a p2p currency? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:27:26
he wont
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:28:12
You can't have him PEE PEE POO POO
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:40:17
Yup, I've been trying to explain this to people when they ask me if im worried that it crashes. 
I'd rather take my chances on greatness and fail than wallow in mediocrity 
Risk aversion is a sign of a follower to me

Just finished curing 2 ozs. Im feeling great
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:32:45
... We have a retard in the white-house because of people like you. You are directly culpable. I hope you internalize that
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:45
Yeah, Im positively quaking in my boots.
Fucking luddite. 
How's that 401k treating ya? Maybe if you're lucky youll get 15% this year!

Well I'm none of those things, and I'm a pepe supporter. Don't let nazis take your culture for their own, you (dare I say) cuck

I spend crypto on drugs and computer parts, yes
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:33:29
Why LOL? LTC is a very viable currency as it is. I use it currently
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:27:47
That would be great, I've been waiting for a sale
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:46:33
Its been an echo chamber from the start. And yes, a decentralized, globalized value transfer network that is not beholden to banks or nations attracts people of a certain disposition. We've got libertarians, socialists, anarchists. Many people were driven to this community because society branded them criminal for wanted to engage in mutually consensual exchange. Dont act surprised when they dont like the government.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:03:07
Oh it easy to day trade. But if it were easy to profit, everyone would do it
For example, my friend sold at around 8k, intending to short. Now here he his, locked out of the rocketship 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:39:49
I think BCH is an alt coin pretender.
But posting shit like this tells everyone that you dont understand bitcoin at all.
The name is transferable  to whichever chain the community decides is the legitimate bitcoin chain.
Notice have everyone calls ETH the real Etherium chain, While ETC is the alt ethereum, despite being the original chain
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:15:04
Why wouldn't you expect to see ROI in a subreddit discussing an investment??
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:42:08
You don't understand the consensus aspect of the tech
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:23:28
Yeah Im aware of the chain war. the issue is that BCH has positioned itself as the small scale transactional coin. Which was LTCs turf 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:08:39
Then don't cry when you lose your allowance in a dip, kiddo 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:03:30


We're done here. Since you cant even use google properly
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:15:36
No he didn't. Did you actually analyze the charts or did you just take his word for granted because you glanced at the shape of the lines?
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:28:10
That's amazing. If you keep going, you'll never have to take them back to fiat at all.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:58:57
You GOTTA believe
Im not even memeing. If you don't believe, you'll get shook out in a dip. If you do, you'll hodl and be rewarded. 
If you cant handle the anxiety, you're not gonna make it

Don't waste your time trying to assuage noobs. Let them FUD themselves out and enjoy your discount 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:21:43
No, i read this guy's shit and felt compelled to dispel his lies.
Here's a real pull. With the Y axis not conspicuously missing
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:41:39
Because its only a solution until the next time it needs to scale and you need to raise the limit again. If that continues then it will lead to network centralization 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:17:10
Why in gods name do people keep talking about taxes?
Its a CURRENCY people. You don't pay taxes if you never convert it back to fiat
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:41:10
That's a better rebuttal than his first attempt

We went from no  flight to men on the moon in less than one lifetime

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:27:22
Yeah pretty much
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:26:23
Im in that thread. I can't get it through to them that we have the same conversation with the same doomsday predictions every single time BTC hits a milestone
It was an unsustainable bubble at $100,$500,$1000,$2500,$5000 and now $10,000
Let the luddites wallow in their mediocrity.  They dont deserve to reap the benefits
 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:37:12
Im not sure you understand that the way BTC is currently classifed; you need to be paying taxes on EACH AND EVERY TRADE. 
I've made dozens of trades in manic episodes flipping alts. 
They're the ones who misclassified it. So they can eat my ass if they want compliance.  
I'm not giving a dime more than I am required to this administration. Im not giving a cent more than I have to in order to contribute to neo imperialism. 
Bitcoin is for everyone. Im not going to let one nation demand their tribute from what I've gained contributing to the wealth of the people. 
Again, if they want to single me out and try to nail me I'll be happy to pay the "get out of jail" fee. But its also possible that I lost all my gains in a series of ill-timed monero trades. If you know what I mean
