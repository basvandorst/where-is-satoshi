Ah, Coinomi is a wallet. I just assumed it was an exchange.

Was this picture taken recently? As of 2019, the EU has actually implemented a cap on credit card interchange fees, so merchants there are paying a negligible amount compared to US merchants. 
The new fee cap for in-person transactions is only 0.2% for debit cards and 0.3% for credit cards. Whereas in the US, retail merchants pay around 1.75-2% in fees for in-person transactions, and even more for online transactions.

This had to be the worst con artist movie I've ever seen. None of the cons made any sense at all.

How long have you been processing, and what's your CB percentage? If you've been processing for longer than 3 months and have well under 1% CB's, you should be able to start shopping around for better rates.
Edit: I would check with Humboldt and Paysafe first. Or you could try going straight to Chase Bank (Paymentech). I know they allow supplements, not sure about CBD oil though.

Although you're in a "high-risk industry", you shouldn't be paying more than 3.5-4% all in. Even negative option products get better rates than 7%.

What the fuck kind of processing do you have where you paying 7% in total fees?
