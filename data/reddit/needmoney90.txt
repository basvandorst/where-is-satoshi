Not sure why you're getting downvoted, fungibility only works if it's not optional. If you have optional fungibility, an exchange can just blacklist all coins using privacy tech, and only allow "clean" coins in the system...and then you're back to square one. 
A private ledger is sorely needed, and Monero is the only working private coin with a dev team worth their salt at the moment.

Really interesting video! After watching that, i'm now wondering if its possible for a malicious actor to steal your Trezor, overwrite the firmware with some code that doesn't check the PIN, and then steal your coins.

Pro 1mb limit:
If you raise the limit, blocks are larger. If blocks are larger, it takes longer to transmit a solved block to the network. With this in mind, there are centralization risks that begin to emerge: the larger a miner is (proportional to the rest of the network), the more benefit they gain from not needing to transmit a block to themselves. Even with a 1% advantage (seemingly small), on a long enough timeline, the compounding effects of that 1% could be massive. We don't know how this will effect centralization in the long run, and once it's released, we can't say "oops" and go back to 1mb. So, keep 1mb until we can solve the centralization problem (or raise the limit in lockstep with global bandwidth increases).
(That's just one of multiple arguments for small blocks).
Note that I personally think that we should raise the limit in the short term, but with an absolute maximum of 8mb until we have time to evaluate how the network reacts. Despite that, I still recognize the reasons behind wanting small blocks, and don't dismiss them out of hand.

1. This community has a vocal minority of people with fringe views (anti-government, anti-bank). They can also be very hostile towards people without those views. Understand that the technology is completely divorced from the ideologies of this subreddit, however much proponents want to conflate them.
2. Don't put in money you can't afford to lose.
3. Altcoins are a fool's game. If you think you can "win" at the altcoin game, I have a bridge to sell you. (Not dismissing any altcoins, but the vast majority of alts currently in existence will fail)
4. Mining is a venture for people who can't do math, and for people who have lots of capital to spend. Basically, if anyone can put up $50 for a return of $50+$X, over time, X will tend towards zero. If you think you can compete against people with deep pockets...see the aforementioned bridge comment.
5. Your time is worth more than the output of a bitcoin faucet. Get a job, even a part time one, if you want coins. Trust me, you won't build a fortune through faucets.
6. If you don't have the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoins. If you don't have the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoins. If you don't have the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoins. Repeat this until you've drilled it into your skull.
7. If you have a significant amount of coins, get a hardware wallet. I recommend a Trezor. The Trezor is amazing. (I am not affiliated with Trezor).

When someone mentions that they currently use/like a bank (a voluntary contractual agreement between two private parties), and someone else comes out of the woodwork to say "banks are thieves, fuck the state/government", I would say that is aggressive. The immediate backlash against any kind of government regulation, or the existing monetary system, is off-putting to many people who come to this sub to learn about Bitcoin.

Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work for distributed consensus, which is the mechanism by which the double spend problem was solved. What you're asking for is, effectively, a way to guarantee that a transaction won't be double spent, before there is even a confirmation. 
I have serious doubts that there is any way to "solve" the problem you're describing in a decentralized way: at best this puts a bandage on the problem, and at worst, people will feel more comfortable with supposedly secure double spend transactions that aren't actually secure.

The problem comes in when a large miner wants to distribute their block to the network. If a large miner makes a max-size block, then any small miner wanting to mine on top of it needs to download it. The time that small miner takes to download the block is added to the time necessary to solve the next block, which marginally reduces their returns (and marginally increases the returns of the large miner).

Unfortunately, mixing coins isn't as easy of a problem as it sounds. I've read a number of posts about "just mixing" coins in this thread, but i've avoided commenting on it until now. 
From a purely analysis-based standpoint, all Coinbase cares about is demonstrating a sequential link between bitcoins that they sold you, and some flagged address. If you decide to mix your bitcoins, they get thrown into a pool with other bitcoins, who's owners also want them to be mixed. 
In many cases, all parties involved are trying to avoid detection by the entities selling them coins. This approach is obviously flawed: while the exact purchaser of each item in the aggregate group is impossible to determine (without the cooperation of the mixer), there is a transaction series from each participant's addresses to a flagged address. In fact, you have no way of guaranteeing that the coins you put into the mixer won't end up at a flagged address anyways. All a mixer provides is anonymity in regards to your final transaction, it doesn't provide safety from chain analysis.

Miners need an incentive to secure the network. Currently, that incentive is approximately equal to the block reward pus fees (50/(2^(floor[years/4])) + fees). 
As the number of years increases, the first half of that formula, 50/(2^(floor[years/4])) approaches zero, and the only remaining term is the fees. 
In the future, when the block reward is zero, miners need an incentive to mine. That incentive is the fees. By subsidizing fees now, and not letting a natural fee market grow, we are potentially shooting ourselves in the foot later, when fees are actually necessary.

Careful, it also takes a 2% fee or so, IIRC. It isn't a free transaction, and buying and selling one after another will incur losses. I would recommend hedging with a trade on an exchange, and selling locally at the same time as the hedge trade, locking in your profits. When you finish a trade in the opposite direction, you exit your hedge and claim your profits.

This is a good read that google turned up for me:
Basically, Paypal has no counterparty risk for accepting ACH transfers quickly. Any inflows and outflows in their system use the ACH system, and so if there's a payment issue on one end, they can put a stop on the transaction on the other end, easily. With Coinbase, they need to wait the full duration of the ACH transfer, before releasing funds to the buyer, because the buyer can transfer the coins out of their account. There's no equivalent of that in Paypal's model.

A blockchain is basically a database. Using a blockchain has many drawbacks compared to using a normal database. One drawback, for example, is the block time: No data can be written to the chain until a block has been compiled, whereas a database can theoretically update state after each transaction. The benefit gained from a blockchain though, is the ability to trust the data written in the chain by untrusted parties. Blockchains are effectively useless in the situation where you trust all writing parties, which is the case in a private chain system. Why would you use a blockchain over a database, when you aren't even leveraging the benefit that a blockchain gives you?

You can use BIP39 passphrase encryption on your Trezor, which adds a second layer of security than just the private key. To break that, your adversary would need to both break the physical security of the Trezor (the scenario you're imagining now), **and** the BIP39 passphrase you chose. You can have multiple different passphrases for the same private key, too: if you are under duress, you can provide access to a secondary dummy key containing a fraction of your funds. If you would like, I can link you to the relevant source material on how to activate it.

It's a way of indirectly measuring what economists refer to as "monetary velocity". If I take one coin and trade it back and forth 1000 times, days destroyed is incremented by the same amount as if I moved the same coin a single time. Basically, if days destroyed spikes, coins that were previously dormant are on the move again, potentially re-entering the Bitcoin economy.

For the record, I am in favor of raising the size to 8mb, and I agree that 8mb itself won't be a significant problem in terms of centralization risk.
However, I think that the issue isn't as dire as many people are claiming at the moment. A large amount of microtransactions are currently taking up mempool/block space, and if we don't raise the limit now, those will be infeasible to send, and will open up more space for the larger (&gt;$1) transactions. 
As a programmer myself, I think a good course of action would be to evaluate the efficacy of larger block sizes, and *hopefully* end up in a situation where we need to hard fork once, as opposed to twice (or more). If we plaster over the problem now with added space, I don't think the incentive to actually build a scalable system will emerge until its potentially too late. 
For better or for worse, the current stonewalling is acting as a pressure buildup to come to a conclusion on a final solution. Perhaps we'll have a mempool crisis where blocks are constantly full: while this is not an ideal situation, Bitcoin would not die. It would still exist, albeit in a slightly crippled sense compared to its current form. 
I'm just not seeing the urgency to fork now and kick the can down the road, then fork later once we (hopefully) have a scalable solution, we should be dealing with the problem now, while Bitcoin is still small, not once it's grown up even more.

I won't claim "absolute safest", but if you print a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet on a laptop offline, booted from a live system on a flash drive, I'd say that's pretty safe. To be totally honest, it's probably just as safe (in terms of risk at the moment) to generate a paper wallet on your normal laptop while its offline instead of using a live system, but you asked about  "absolute safest", so. Store your Bitcoins there, and perhaps make 2 copies, storing one at home, the other in a safety deposit box.
Note: this is how I told my parents to store bitcoin, if they ever decide to buy any for an investment. They aren't completely sold yet, but the legitimacy *is* growing in their eyes, from all the recent news. My dad has even heard it mentioned a few times in the past few months, and he's a general contractor, nothing to do with technology. I gave him a paper wallet with $25 loaded on it this Christmas, to put in his safe, and use as an unhackable offline storage place for coins. His generation feels safer when there's a tangible object, as opposed to an intangible digital number.

The implication is not that this is more robust than cryptolocker. Using a decentralized protocol like bitcoin to issue commands, a virus creator can later change the actions of the virus under their control. Imagine if the creator of cryptolocker, instead of just passively acquiring Bitcoins from people paying the ransom on infected computers, could instead turn around and sell access to his botnet to the highest bidder. The address controlling the botnet can transfer ownership, control ability, to another address by simply sending it a specific amount of funds. Another user suggested that a virus creator could sell shares of the profits of the virus, and have all the people who fund its creation anonymously receive their share of the profits in Bitcoin, or perhaps make executive decisions about what the virus does.

Great post. I hadn't thought of this in terms of AI, but the word "antifragile" puts it in perspective. A new form of distributed, always on network. I've been looking at this from a purely computer security point of view (because of my class), thanks for the new idea!

Full disclosure, this paper was written at the last minute for a grade, and its not my best work ever. The idea is there, and the code was written well beforehand, but the paper isn't very polished. Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to be polishing it up and removing most of the filler parts soon. 
Also, p2p viruses are vulnerable to some attacks to shut them down, that using the blockchain isn't. Sybil attacks, for example. The blockchain is more robust than any p2p virus I'm currently aware of.

Possible, but the hash would need to span multiple addresses. The key insight in this design is the ability to store and retrieve instructions in an uncensorable way, as its decentralized.

Yes, a 51% attack could be used as a vector to shut down the botnet. Essentially, i'm using the Blockchain as an uncensorable decentralized datastore, from which commands are issued to infected computers. As far as I can see, its literally impossible (other than a 51% attack) to shut down, unlike every other (current) virus communication vector.
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:13:45

*Edit: also, thin client. Read through the thread, I've addressed most of your concerns in other comments
@_date: 2014-12-13 05:35:43
Absolutely! The limitation is only being able to store 20 bytes in an address. However, I don't think its really practical, as you can store the IP of the update server along with a number of satoshi designating update mode, so why would you store the entire update on the blockchain? 
*edit: unless by push updates, you mean storing an IP and update flag. In that case, you are correct.

If you read the paper, theres actually a section talking about this! The memory footprint can be reduced to 1mb, the size of a block, if you utilize a thin client. Basically, you download the transaction history block by block, hash each block, and compare the hash to that in the next block, discarding the prior one. At the same time, you save all transactions sent from your target address, to determine what to do next. There's an overhead of downloading the whole blockchain once, so like 20ish GB of bandwidth used, but that's spread over a long period of time.

I'm a programmer, and I think the opposition to RBF is misguided. I see RBF (or at least opt-in RBF) as a feature that improves Bitcoin in any situation where there is a fee market (that is, blocks are full). It allows users to engage in a bidding war to take up a space in the next block. In this context, RBF has obvious utility.
A vendor can choose to not accept RBF-tagged transactions. Any wallet implementing RBF would be stupid to put it as a default (instead, if it rolls out, I imagine there would be a check box for "transaction can be reversed before first confirmation?" Or "charge back" or something). In this situation, no utility is lost, only a person expecting to perform a fraudulent transaction would use it for a brick and mortar vendor. I'm not seeing any reason why RBF is going to be detrimental.

This is a phase. We are already approaching the limits of performance improvements in mining ASICs, they're pretty close to the same level in size that CPUs are at now. Right now, the fastest person to each level gets to ride out the performance improvement gains until others catch up. Once we hit that limit, multiple manufacturers will be producing chips of roughly the same efficiency, and everyone will have access to commodity ASICs. Thats when mining really decentralizes.

So, from what I understand, the consortium of banks (R3) will be using a round-robin block signing strategy. Every bank in the consortium gets a key, and they take turns signing the blocks (this may be a simplification, I don't know if the "round robin" signing is deterministic or probabilistic). 
My predictions on use: As the banks trust each other (to an extent), and they know that none of them can falsify transactions without the collusion of other bank members, they could peg a dollar value of reserves  to either an amount of coins, use colored tokens for transferrable assets on the blockchain, contract settlement, securities issuance, and more. 
If you believe that "blockchain" is a concept that inherently requires a proof of work (many people do), then what they are building is not a blockchain. However, it is a chain of blocks, so I can see why it would be called that. Its an interesting system, its technically sound, and it will definitely improve efficiency in the banking settlement system. Will it replace Bitcoin? Probably not. I think the two will coexist just fine.

Coinbase has indicated that in the event of a fork, they will give their users access to their coins on both sides. Thats why they've been experimenting with different clients, they want to ensure that regardless of the direction we go in, they'll always be prepared.
~~Edit: I can't find a reference to Brian saying this, only him saying that they'll stick with the longest chain that has an economic majority. But as a programmer, I can't see any reason why they wouldn't provide you with the ability to spend coins on either fork, should that occur.~~

All technologies, Bitcoin included, started with a small userbase, which then grew. Arguing that an existing technology is currently small, ergo it will always be small, is silly.


This is correct. However, you haven't mentioned any coins using the cryptonote protocol, like Monero (which is the leading cryptonote currency in development, community, and market cap). Cryptonote coins allow for privacy _guarantees_ that are mathematically provable. 
Monero is held, endorsed and contributed to by both [Peter Todd]( and [Gregory Maxwell]( (Monero was originally a fork of Bytecoin's code) from the Bitcoin Core team (I was lazy finding references, but you can independently verify that they have both contributed to the Monero codebase). And it allows for privacy guarantees that Bitcoin cannot implement (see the "Satoshi's Coins" problem on the subreddit, and issues with unblinded transaction fees). If you haven't heard of it, check it out!
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:26:56
Yeah! The only downside is that they expect ~20% as payment, which is pretty hefty. Honestly, you'll learn a lot more writing a Python script to do it for you, the code and concept for a brute force are drop-dead simple (I may be out of touch with what "simple" means in terms of a new programmer though). And you'll get to keep the extra 20%, so thats good incentive. 
I wish you the best of luck, Python is quite a fun language to code in (compared to C). Its interesting/strange how closely Python code resembles natural language, oftentimes I look at the code I wrote, and it takes me a little to figure out whether I actually wrote code, or just jotted down a rough sketch of what I want it to do.

To everyone claiming that this card is somehow "not actually using Bitcoin": 
Adoption is a process, not an event. It takes time for cost and convenience to catch up to the bleeding edge of what's possible. Most of you weren't around back then, but in 2011, the idea that this card would even exist was ludicrous. I think a lot of people miss exactly how far the space has come in such a short timeframe. Keep it up Coinbase, you're doing an awesome job.
PS: I've had the Shift card since December 5th, and slowly eased into using it. I've been 100% Bitcoin for 2 weeks now (the 12th was the last day I used my debit card), and it feels great. I store my coins on a Trezor, and transfer $100-$200 at a time into my Coinbase account whenever I want to top it up, so I hold the majority of my private keys.

If you read through my comment history, you'll find that i'm actually pretty agnostic to the outcome of the blocksize debate, and instead like to point out the argument of the other side to people. I play devil's advocate.


If you want to speak in absolutes, then you have nothing you can learn from me. I believe that we are currently at a fork in the road (heh), and the direction of the two paths are mutually exclusive. 
On one side, there is Bitcoin the global currency that has scaled to support payments around the globe. Whether that vision is realizable in a distributed system within the constraints of today's computing technology is a big question mark. We also don't know what the effects of not developing a fee market now will be. Perhaps later in time, the network will be rendered insecure without the block subsidy, and will fail. These are both relevant concerns, and I urge you not to dismiss them without considering them.
On the other side is Bitcoin the immutable, ultrasecure settlement network. This can be developed, essentially without risks. As the subsidy drops off, the average fee value of each transaction can rise to keep the network secure, and settlements on this network will primarily involve colored coins (asset tokens), mid-sized value transfers, and payment channels like the Lightning Network. If the LN is developed (I agree it is vapourware at the moment, but conceptually, the idea doesn't have any flaws that I can find), the prior scenario can also play out.
There are obviously views that go on a spectrum between these two, but these are the extrema, and I think both have benefits and drawbacks. I also don't think that the outcome is set in stone yet. I choose not to choose, and instead entertain the possibility of both.

Eh, Dash is good in most situations, but it can't give mathematical guarantees on privacy like Monero can. Not to mention that Monero transactions are optionally transparent through the use of a view-key, so they can be audited (try that with Dash!). 
I have serious doubts that Dash's privacy model can hold up against nation-state level attacks (hacks/viruses/subpoenas on the masternodes). A lot of Dash people say "if the security model is broken, deanonymize [this transaction]", and when no one can do it, tout that as "proof" the protocol is secure, but that kind of misses the point. Its like saying "Well if god doesn't exist, prove it!". Unless you can give me a mathematical proof that my transactions are unlinkable and untraceable, I can't trust the privacy model. I shouldn't need to trust anything outside of the protocol itself.

From experience, around January of 2015 I withdrew $2000 from my account at Chase, and explicitly said I was using it to buy Bitcoin (at $300, right before the big drop). Nothing happened to my account. One of the bankers actually seemed interested, which was neat. Of course, this is anecdotal, so I can't speak as to their global policy. But I was fine.
I've also bought thousands of dollars worth over the course of 2015 from Coinbase, not a peep from Chase about that either.

It is not competing with Bitcoin in the sense most people believe. Many in the Monero community think that theres a need for both a private and a public ledger, and both have their own applicable niches. I see utility in having both, so I personally have a 50/50 split of BTC and XMR. 
One thing to note: Some corporations have been hesitant to adopt Bitcoin for their supply-chain funding, because of the public nature of transactions. When you can trace back the origin (or destination) of funds, you can infer who suppliers are, what kind of cash flows a company deals with a day, and other things from metadata. With Monero, that is no longer an issue, and you can optionally provide a "view-key", which lets you observe and audit incoming/outgoing transactions from a particular address (imagine a charity, or donations for a political campaign). 
It will be interesting to see where the tech ends up further down the road, but its extremely promising, and solves some issues that Bitcoin hasn't (or can't). Both can happily coexist, neither needs to usurp/beat the other.

No need to use a third party whatsoever. The firmware is open source, you can hack on it yourself. I personally use mine hooked up to Mycelium on my phone, the communication protocol to talk to the Trezor over USB is well documented. They also use a BIP39 mnemonic (24-word phrase) for the Hierarchical Deterministic key, you write that down when you first get the wallet, and put it in a safe place. If you lose your Trezor, you can recover the funds using that key: you don't even need the device, let alone the company to be around to feel safe.
If you want one, head on over to the [Official Website]( you can buy it for $100. I highly recommend getting the USB OTG cable add-on, if you have a smartphone.

Monero has gotten a lot of FUD in the past, but most of it is undeserved, and its history is fascinating. Take a long, hard look at it, and read up on how its privacy model works, the cryptonote protocol is really cool. 
There's definitely something there, I personally have 50% of my crypto allocation in it. I really like that the currency is private by default, public by choice (as opposed to the other way around). But don't take my word for it, do some research!

Abysmal? I wouldn't call a near 50% reduction in orphan rates abysmal. 
Also, how is this in any way sacrificing security? You need to expend as much effort to make an invalid header as it would take to mine a full block. Needing to expend that much effort is literally what secures the network. If you can't trust the work done, you can't trust anything in the network.

I just gave empirical evidence that anyone who purchases from Coinbase and uses a Trezor + Hot wallet (the safest and most commonly recommended way to use your BTC) can encounter this easily. And my situation was an absolute minimum number of transactions. For anyone buying from Coinbase, by the time the coins even end up in your own wallet (step 5), you already have a minimum of a 5-transaction chain. How is that in any way unusual?

Coinbase keeps an exportable record of all transactions made on their platform, for tax purposes. Every time you make a transaction with the shift card, BTC are pulled from your Coinbase account, and sent to an entity called "Shift Payments". These transactions are recorded in the tax file with the BTC amount and price in USD that you sent. If you buy your coins through them, and "sell" through Shift, all the relevant tax information will be in the file, you just need to decide whether your taxes will be taken LIFO or FIFO (whether you're taking capital gains / losses relative to the oldest coins you bought, or the most recent ones).

Let me ask you an honest question, If cloud mining is such a safe and profitable investment, why aren't people parking their millions in it? Why haven't you taken out loans to capitalize on this opportunity? If it is as profitable and safe as you claim, then obviously only an idiot wouldn't put their money into this industry.
Now that you've considered that question (note that even a cursory examination of the premises embedded in your title would dissuade a smart investor away from cloud mining): Buying and holding BTC has (historically) almost always been more profitable than buying mining equipment and mining. From memory, the only time it wasn't was late 2013/early 2014 with the first gen ASICs, but that ship sailed a long time ago.

The numbers you're looking to compare are the VXD (Dow Jones' volatility index) and


If you like, I can try and run the numbers myself, if you don't want to do the math to calculate the annualized 30-day BTCUSD variance.
Also, before calculating it, I would say the odds that Bitcoin is less volatile than the Dow are so low as to be negligible. Considering that var is annualized, and over the past year there has been a range where the top was at least 100% above the bottom, smart money says the VXD is lower.
Edit: the math is a bit weirder than I assumed at first glance, the VXD and VIX are pegged against implied volatility, which is generally calculated from option premium percentages, if I remember correctly. There isn't a thriving options market here yet, so the number won't be as solid as you may be looking for.

Lets say someone today offers to sell you as many $1 bills* as you like, for 20 cents each. You think this is a great idea, and take him up on his offer, to the tune of $100 out-of-pocket. 
*We will pretend that most people people only want cents for the rest of the year, so you can't cash out your Dollars until then.
Tomorrow, the same guy offers a new deal: He's now selling $1 bills for 10 cents apiece, and he's also buying back any bills he previously sold you for 10 cents, as well. In this situation, what makes more sense: Selling your 100 $1 bills at a 50% loss, or buying more dollars at a steeper discount?
This may seem like a contrived example, but the situation with Bitcoin is surprisingly similar, in terms of the Expected Value (EV = the sum of all outcomes multiplied by their probability of occurring). In the case of the example, your EV starts out at 5 ($1/$0.20 * 100% probability), and goes up to 10 ($1/$0.10 * 100% probability). 
With Bitcoin, many people believe the final value of each coin will either be very high (conservative estimates say $50,000/BTC minimum), or practically nothing. However, this is where the math gets odd: What are the odds of Bitcoin's success? Lets arbitrarily peg them at a modest 10% (I personally think the odds are higher, but that is neither here nor there). The EV at $1000/coin in this case is 5 ($50,000/$1,000 * 10% + $0/$1,000 * 90%), whereas the EV at $500/coin is 10 ($50,000/$500 * 10% + $0/$500 * 90%). 
As you can see, even with a probability of success at 10% (where success means reaching $50,000/BTC), Bitcoin at $500 has the same EV as buying $1 for $0.10. Even if you had bought at $1000, you still have an EV of 5, the EV is independent of the price at any given moment. Why on earth would you sell now? If anything, you should be loading up on as many coins as your risk appetite can handle.

I do. I can personally attest to having a hot wallet on my phone that I load with $100-$200 off of my Trezor when it starts running low. Since I send that entire figure to a single generated address, I end up making multiple transactions (coffee, purchases online, gift cards, what have you) from that balance. Since I initially get the coins from Coinbase, the order of transactions is at minimum:
1. Block reward
2. Pool Miner Distribution
3. Miner sells to Coinbase
4. Internal transfer to my account (Coinbase performs a transaction on-chain internally for record keeping purposes)
5. My cold wallet
6. My hot wallet
7. Payments for things.
If I make more than 4 payments on a single hot-wallet top-up, the minimum length of the transaction chain will be 10. This seems a bit restrictive.

At a price of $400, $1 is approximately .25%, which means for a buy/sell pair, your exchange **must** have fees less that .125% at the very least, to break even. Not many have fees that low, and even then, you're still going to either need to wait and make the market, or cross the spread.

There's this magical concept called an equilibrium price, where for some strange reason, people don't pump at a loss, or sell below cost. Imagine that, if prices get really low, some people stop pumping, which drops supply, and the price goes up! Probably just some crazy theory though, it only makes sense that a business would constantly erode its bottom line to benefit its shareholders.

Near the end of 2014 I used LocalBitcoins, and then over the course of 2015 I used Coinbase almost exclusively. I keep about $1000 or so in USD for emergencies, but the rest I transfer into BTC. I could use BitWage, but I like being able to dynamically allocate my purchases, as opposed to it being a lump sum.
And before anyone comments, I know. I'm not "actually using Bitcoin" or something. I've been around since 2011, and even the idea that the Shift card would *exist* back then was ludicrous. Adoption is a process, not an event. It takes time before convenience and cost catch up with the bleeding edge of whats possible.

I use BTC as my primary payment vehicle now. I need to pay rent and insurance in USD (I could probably defer the insurance to BTC, but I'm lazy), but other than that, the majority of the remainder of my funds are in BTC. 
I use the Shift card basically every day to pay for things. I need to eat, and therefore I spend coins at whatever price they currently are.

Actually, there's a quick and dirty hack you can use to see how many upvotes or downvotes a comment has. If you go to your settings, you can alter the line:


By tweaking it (either positive or negative), you can trick the system into "collapsing" (in this case, the [-] next to the comment changes to a [+], because of the CSS changes) the comments you're looking at. I can tell you that the RockettotheFAC3 has approximately 19 downvotes at the moment.

Consider the Trezor! It's a bit more expensive, but it has a small screen. The screen has interesting security implications, for example, it lets you access your funds on a compromised computer without any risk. (It does this by displaying a scrambled keypad on the Trezor, and you enter the PIN on a blank keypad on the computer. No way for a keylogger to snag your PIN). The Ledger wallet is quite nice too, though!

USD-denominated debt held globally is at insane levels due to the low interest rate environment, and its about to go bad at an unprecedented rate. Which is going to cause the dollar to spike in value (credit contraction), leading to import/export/employment issues domestically due to everyone else devaluing their currencies. Then a flight to safety as currencies worldwide devalue, and seek shelter in the dollar. Then QE4 (domestic unemployment due to an extremely expensive dollar will pretty much force the Fed's hand), and we're in a global currency war, with no way to stop printing. There doesn't seem to be a way out of this..

I'm pro-2mb (actually, anything up to 8mb is fine with me for maintaining the ability to run a full node at home). I also have a degree in CS, so I'm not exactly a casual in the area.
If we were to have 2mb though, we would need some sort of bandwidth smoothing implementation, like thinblocks, where everyone agrees to order transactions from the mempool in a certain way. That way, your bandwidth usage is smoothed over the time between blocks. I think with that, or similar improvements, once fully tested, we can maintain decentralization at a higher block size.

Aha! I actually remember that conversation thread. 
I believe that was where I was pointing out the lack of BTC margin available relative to the amount of USD margin (on Bitfinex). Back then, and now still, (though I've refined it a lot) I used those figures to make price movement predictions. There wasn't much BTC liquidity available to borrow, which adds a theoretical damper on how low the price can go. Looking back at the date that comment was posted, it preceded the large drop to below $200, so I was actually incorrect about what the lack of margin would do to the price (I was bullish back then). 
I occasionally go through and delete my old comments, you can never be too careful these days. I prefer to make it harder for people to identify me in general, and if that means deleting old posts, so be it. I'm not sure how that thread made you think I was a prepper, but everyone is entitled to their opinions.

For Coinbase, I know that they raised my limits after waiting a certain amount of time from when I made a payment. I assume this is due to potential fraud chargebacks, there is a window after you get your coins where the bank could potentially take the payment back (60, 90, or 120 days, depending on the type of chargeback).
I've had my limit raised multiple times there, and after having an account for maybe a year, its currently at $10,000/day. You need to build up a reputation with the person you're buying from, actions definitely speak louder than words when it comes to money. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:36:01
I believe that we are currently at a fork in the road (heh), and the direction of the two paths are mutually exclusive. 
On one side, there is Bitcoin the global currency that has scaled to support payments around the globe. Whether that vision is realizable in a distributed system within the constraints of today's computing technology is a big question mark. We also don't know what the effects of not developing a fee market now will be. Perhaps later in time, the network will be rendered insecure without the block subsidy, and will fail. These are both relevant concerns, and I urge you not to dismiss them without considering them.
On the other side is Bitcoin the immutable, ultrasecure settlement network. This can be developed, essentially without risks. As the subsidy drops off, the average fee value of each transaction can rise to keep the network secure, and settlements on this network will primarily involve colored coins (asset tokens), mid-sized value transfers, and payment channels like the Lightning Network. If the LN is developed (I agree it is vapourware at the moment, but conceptually, the idea doesn't have any flaws that I can find), the prior scenario can also play out.
There are obviously views that go on a spectrum between these two, but these are the extrema, and I think both have benefits and drawbacks. I also don't think that the outcome is set in stone yet. I choose not to choose, and instead entertain the possibility of both. I'm happy to address any of the statements if you like.

So, the issue is with the legacy banking system, once you actually have Bitcoins, its much easier to use. You don't link your bank account to a wallet, you send money from your bank account to Coinbase, who transfers coins into your wallet (on their servers). Then once the payment clears (5 days or so, sorry, its not Bitcoin's fault, that's just how banks work) you can transfer them from Coinbase into to the wallet you have set up.

In that situation, why would people necessarily use the same pools? I imagine that with fragmentation and expansion of the mining community (which will happen when ASICs are commoditized), we'd see a much larger diversity of pools compared to what we have at the moment. Only the hardcore people who literally make their own ASICs are majorly in the game at this point.

TL;DR, you can finish the brute forcing of two words very very quickly. My conservative estimates for how quickly, on a single core 1GHz processor machine? 40 seconds, from when you start the program to when its cracked.
If you have a local copy of the UTXO set, fast. (Tip: because you're just looking for a matching address, you can store your UTXO set in a hash table, which means lookups have a runtime complexity O(1))
You just needs to iterate over a list of 2000 words, and hold two numbers in memory (the index of each half of the pair into the list). The algorithm to generate the private key from the 13 words, and then to convert the private key into the public key, doesn't take very long to calculate. It wasn't designed to be a computationally difficult task. 
Check out [this stack overflow post]( for an example of how fast the conversion from private to public can be done. 
Processors can perform billions of cycles per second, and if we assume a very generous 10,000 cycles to do the conversion + lookup, and a modest 1,000,000,000 cycles thrown at it (1GHz for 1 second), we could try 100,000 addresses. For 4,000,000 combinations, that's 40 seconds. And this isn't taking into account multiple cores! This task is highly parallelizable, and the hashmap is a static object, so concurrent access is no problem.

Oh man, this is fascinating.

Because diversification has to do with the correlation of returns of each asset in the portfolio, and not necessarily the variance. Am I getting that right?

Personally, I store ~$50 (.2-.25 BTC) in Mycelium constantly, which I can access any time I like for things like small online purchases, and buying Starbucks at a 20% discount while i'm out of the house. I also have a Trezor which stays at home, containing the bulk of my coins. The Trezor is linked into Mycelium, so I can see the balance on the go, and also generate receive addresses that immediately go into cold storage (without needing to pull the Trezor out). When the funds in my hot wallet start running low, I top it up from my Trezor, and i'm good to go. If my phone gets hacked/stolen, i'm only out $50 in BTC, so I feel pretty safe. 
To answer your other question, you should never have Bitcoins in an address who's private key is on a device that is exposed to the internet, if you aren't willing to lose them. If you are able to spend your coins from any device, without needing to interact in some way with something not on that device (hardware wallet, paper wallet), then anyone who has access to that device (either physically or remotely through a hack) can spend them too.

Block withholding attacks in a perfectly decentralized network are ineffectual. The opportunity cost of waiting extra time before broadcasting is equal to the potential gain by withholding.
In a partially-decentralized system like ours, where mining pools can control a significant chunk of the hash rate, the benefit to withholding blocks increases in proportion to the pool's percentage of the network. Basically, the more hashpower you control (as a fraction of the network), the more effective a block withholding attack gets (in terms of net revenue in the long run).

The blockchain is an in-order list of every transaction ever. Since your transaction was recent, you'll need to download the whole chain to see the coins in your wallet. I wouldn't recommend using the Core wallet to most beginner users, you should use an SPV wallet (no need to download the full chain). Try multibit or electrum. There are tutorials on how to import your wallet.dat file (holding your private keys) to those wallets, without needing to finish syncing from Core. Google for how to export your keys and import them into your new wallet. Good luck!

Of course, this requires that the server can manipulate the DOM and present the client with an altered version sans-ad DOM.

Glad I could help! I take it you have your coins safely stored in electrum or multibit now?

There's a T+3 settlement time (and the potential for transaction reversals) with USD transfers due to the legacy banking system. By performing the settlement in BTC with two trusted endpoints, you can have your money in your account in an hour, as opposed to 4 days. In this case, Bitcoin is being used as a settlement layer, and it has *tons* of utility there.

Ipfs is unique from bittorrent, in that it uses the concept that a hash *is* the file. If you have the hash, anyone with a file matching that hash can serve it to you, no need for a magnet link or a tracker to sync up with for the swarm. The "permanent web", it will work the same in a hundred years as it does now.

I imagine that it would let you bootstrap a couple thousand satoshi, which can be used for all sorts of things (reputation systems, message signing, smart contracts, digital asset tokens...). Just because the amount of Bitcoin in USD is miniscule, doesn't mean it's not extremely useful within the ecosystem for non-dollar denominated purposes.

Is your core wallet synced, or is it still downloading the chain?

If you're getting a return of X% on something, the risk level of that investment is directly related to X. There is no free lunch. If you think returns that are that outsized are realistic for anything that doesn't have an outsized risk, I have a bridge to sell you.

Oh hey, that was my post! The page didn't redirect when I clicked submit, so I pressed it multiple times, and then when I looked back, it had a balance of ~80 coins in it. The project looks super interesting, I'm seriously considering contributing to see where it can go from here.

Wouldn't mass bankruptcies instead cause the bankrupted entities to liquidate assets in order to cover their debts? I know this has already been one of the causes for the falling precious metal prices, stored supply of precious metals (held by countries, large financial entities, et al) has been coming onto the market in a flood, and I doubt that will abate if we go into a world currency crisis.

Not necessarily, if the attack is targeted (practice on a couple Trezors you buy online). All I'm saying is, the Trezor is not a secure device if you have physical access to it.

50x? Amateur. Try that new exchange with 500x leverage, nothing could possibly go wrong there
@_date: 2015-10-09 22:22:21
Not who you replied to, but I happen to own a Trezor myself, and I have the background to know how it works. 
While it may be improbable, the Trezor *is* actually a vulnerable device, if a (savvy) attacker has physical access to it. The private keys are stored in the hardware in cleartext, unencrypted by the PIN you enter to access it. While the device has no JTAG pins to hook up to, it is possible to etch away parts of the onboard chips, and bypass the PIN.
For the majority of people, the amount stored on the device is negligible enough to consider the thought that someone might actually go through the trouble of doing this, but for amounts &gt;100k, I don't think taking precautions about physically securing your Trezor would be unwise.

The arguments presented in this article seem tenuous at best. The author makes the (faulty) assumption that miners in general are perfectly rational economic actors, which is absolutely not the case. A quote to highlight this:


The implication here seems to be "If mining is unprofitable, all miners will shut off automatically, all at once. And then the hashrate will be zero, and no one will turn miners on again.", but that hinges on all miners being perfectly rational economic actors. Unless i'm missing something, I can't imagine that this doomsday scenario will actually come to pass.

Mt. Gox was trustable too, right up until they weren't. And if you're referencing CoinJoin, the implementation currently has serious privacy degradation issues.

Go to Poloniex. Buy Monero (XMR) for BTC on the exchange. Withdraw, then wait a while, and send the coins to either  or  to get BTC back. You'll lose some money on the fees for Poloniex, as well as some slippage using shapeshift or xmr.to, but thats the most anonymous mixing you can possibly use at this point in time.

With a hard fork, anything is possible, including exceeding the 21m BTC limit. I mean without changing consensus rules.

Do you think that the tail emission is a good idea? That's one thing I doubt Bitcoin can provide in the future.

@_date: 2016-07-06 01:15:33
Fair enough. Thanks for your response, I appreciate it. 
I personally think the tail emission provides security incentive into the future that covers a number of potential inventive attacks that will be possible once the fees exceed the block reward, but we'll see if that actually is an issue or not. Its definitely theoretical at this point.
@_date: 2016-07-08 03:30:58
Yeah, but its possible. Theoretically, a miner could ignore the entire subsidy and all transaction fees, and make some BTC literally inaccessible for the rest of history, even if someone can brute force private keys. If you send to an eater address, you can theoretically recover the Bitcoins if you find a working private key for it...with this, theres literally no way to recover other than rolling back the chain.

What is your opinion on Monero?
@_date: 2016-07-08 05:16:56
I thought about this for an hour, and was about to reply "what if someone finds a working script with the same hash?", and then I saw your edit. Nice catch.
