Oh wow, thank you for the info! 
So, I know I need to look at getting my btc off the Coinbase exchange anyway, but this sounds like if I didn’t make a move then I wouldn’t benefit from any upcoming forks too. 
Is there another fork coming up?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:18:44
Yep. I bought in a bit around the £9k mark around the end of November. Made some gains and sold thinking I was being clever. Then I bought in again around the £12k mark. I’ve kept adding bits when it’s dipped but am down. Not stressing though, just gonna wait it out and see what happens.

Ha! Cheers
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:33:13
I get it, thank you. 
I started out at the end of November 2017 and have been adding small amounts to it since then. 
Edit: year!

Can someone ELI5 about forks? 
Do you have to have held btc for a certain amount of time to get extra btc from the fork? I currently only have a little bit held on an exchange. Does it count if it’s held there or does it need to be held in a private wallet? Will extra btc just suddenly get added to the amount that’s held on the exchange?

I’m on Coinbase. 
Was Bitcoin Cash a forked coin? How do they work out the value of the forked coin? Is it a percentage of your btc at the time of the fork?

I got in about a month ago too so am also really new to it, but Coinbase and Gdax are the same company. So can’t you just log on to gdax with your coinbase details and all your ID info is linked?

I saw the price starting to drop from £13k and panic sold. Then literally 10 min later I saw it starting to creep back up from about £11.5k and bought back in before it got to £12k again. So I think I timed it okish! Decent for a first timer anyway!

I’m looking for iOS app wallet recommendations but there doesn’t seem to be many good ones. So far Airbitz looks best. Any other decent ones?

I’ve slowly been adding to coinbase since last Thursday. I’d deposited £250 total (less fees of about a tenner) and as at about half an hour ago it was at something like £337! It’s dipping now so I’ve quickly withdrawn to my GBP wallet and intend to buy back in nearer the bottom of the dip whenever that’ll be!
Is this a good plan?!
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:21:22
Can anyone recommend an iOS app wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:55:56
I asked a [similar question]( It’s really annoying. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:46:19
I’ve already got out once this morning and then bought back in when it started rising again. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:39:25
Why is there a difference in the valuation on gdax compared to coinbase? Atm it’s £10,335 on coinbase, but £10,614 on gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:35:50
Are gdax fees lower than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:28:56
I started with a tenner on Coinbase just to test it out. Found it pretty easy to set up. I haven’t tried withdrawing to my bank account yet so not sure how easy that is. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:45:39
I thought they were the same company though? I log into gdax with my coinbase info. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:50:24
Just seen, no worries. I figured it must be some kind of lag too. It’s weird. I got a notification through the coinbase app when it hit £10k, but when I opened the app it was still below. The value would have been £10k on gdax. So the app seems to pull alert info from the up to date figures on gdax, but doesn’t display the correct value in the app for a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:45:25
Cheers, I’ll have a look into it tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:24:15
Only wish I had more cash invested!

Doesn’t mention UK on there.  Just says:




@_date: 2017-12-03 23:42:43
Did you use coinbase first too? Is it easy to transfer your bitcoin across?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:43:02
The more I look at it the more I panic when it starts dipping. I need to forget about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:07:47
Thanks, that looks like it might be a safer bet for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:56
Is it not better to withdraw at the top and then buy back in after it’s finished dipping?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:42:56
Only USD? Bugger. I use Coinbase and I’m in the UK. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:49
Can you explain why? Newbie here
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:48:54
Hi, 
I’m completely new to crypto currency. I remember hearing about bitcoin years ago and am kicking myself that I didn’t pay more attention back then. I’ve downloaded Coinbase and have bought a tiny amount just to test the water and try to figure out how things work. Since then it’s leaped from $10k to $11k and again I’m kicking myself for not putting a bigger amount in (not a huge amount, just a sensible amount for me). 
So my question is, do you think there’s going to be a dip anytime soon? Should I wait to put more money in or should I just do it now?
Edit: sneaky “s”
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:44:23
Don’t exchanges have insurance or something to protect the customer if something like this happens?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:37:46
I tested it out with a tiny amount right after it hit $10k and have just upped it this morning. I’ve only got 0.0114 but am obsessed with checking where it’s at every time I pick up my phone!
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:12:43
It’s hit £15k on gdax already. Got the alert last night through the coinbase app. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:38:33
Nice. Only just started with coinbase and am already fed up of their fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:09:30
Does anybody else have issues with Coinbase alerts? I’ve set a few where I should have got an alert and it’s not happened. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:13:20
Is there somewhere where I can check the current value of past individual bitcoin purchases?
