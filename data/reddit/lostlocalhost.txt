Tough crowd there, but nice job.

But as you said, bitaddress.org is the way to go.

How long you guys usually take to ship to the States? I made an order on the 27th, and while it's only been a week, the order still indicates processing. I would have expected a "shipped" status at some point.
Looking forward to getting these. Thanks

Got my stuff today finally. The wait was due to them not having a color I ordered in stock. They added notes to my order and let me know, then doubled my order to make up for the delay. I'm
not saying they'll do this for everyone if there are issues, but it left a good impression on me and I expect I'll be making another order with them. Quality is good - I can't imagine doing much to ruin this thing.
Thanks guys.

Yes he is... 1 beer for your observation! @_date: 2014-05-27 13:34:53
Thanks for the code-made my multi order a few hours ago. Looking forward to these.

Here's an example I made for you. If you spend $50.05 at $650 a BTC, this sheet shows what the BTC value will need to be to make your .077 BTC gain value.
For instance, for you to double the worth (from $50.05 to $100.10) the BTC value will need to raise to $1300. For your $50.05 to be worth $500.50, BTC value needs to rise to $6500.
For fun, at $2,300,000,000, that $50.50 investment would get you $177,100,000.00.

TWSS upvote. Here's 1 coffee @_date: 2014-06-05 17:31:10
Even if payment for your place was through BTC, if it's managed in one transaction nothing would keep them from taking %3 of your share of it for tip for themselves. The problem isn't with the card fees or the payment type, it's with your company's policy.

Mine should be in next week... they're a bit delayed due to a surge in orders, but I contacted them on here about it and they took care of me. Seems a good option for long term storage, or if you're not so concerned about using the same public key with bip.
There may be cheaper solutions, but I like the format and it fits my comfort level and needs.

Used this to play around with, but eventually moved everything to an encrypted PW. Use bitaddress.org instead. Same thing, but can do much more. Doing it through CB just means you can monitor the balance through their system-something I've found blockchain.info does better.
