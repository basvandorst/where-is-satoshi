bitcoin as failing as a political tool.
I agree with the central thesis however the reasons and recommendation I disagree with.
Many of the ideological bitcoiners (those who would use it even if it failed to gain any popular momentum and didnt have risk based - ie need for cryptography) had certain political reasons for using it but for the most part it was:
1. Build bitcoin
2. Tell people about it
3. ???
4. Uproot financial system
5. ???
6. Libertopia
Now many had ideas about the ??? but generally the consensus was vague. Actual tangible goals (quantitative) were't apart of the discussion. 
Failure to discuss it or think about it were the main cause for this. Especially as it went mainstream and a majority of people weren't really ready, nor desired, to be converted to libertairianism. The dude telling people that they just needed to read rothbard or go on CSS was alittle silly. CSS doesnt really, if ever im not sure, deal with agorism or applying tech tools to counter-economics and rothbard required a legal order based on libertarianism for many of his ideas. I'm not dismissing rothbard he may have had a large discussion on how counter economics could work (he could write 8 pages an hour, id appreciate a link).
I disagree with the premise that there needs to be a pre-existing libertarian enclave dealing in things like property rights in order for bitcoin to function politically as long as you can have the crypto currency functional in context of protected by having it hard to/impossible to trace. No irs thugs finding gold bars under your bed.
You dont need to solve the big libertarian dilemma in order to have the crypto-currency trade functional and respected. This is counter to market theory and the history of organic developments in society.
Also the formation of a libertarian enclave DOES indeed require leadership in order to organize the people (even if on here one assumes that once its established by pioneeers it can be decentralized). However the problem of organizing a few tribes and individuals to start an enclave is not the same as the global sanctions and leadership required to apply earth based terraforming (and or limitation of human output) if we assume global warming is a problem. They are not paticulary similar since the scales involved change many of the fundamental assumptions.
I dont know of any evidence that bitcoin requires the czar of the bitcoin foundation to achieve any change. Just look at the work of open-transactions. Yes its one mans idea but its an organic response to some of the problems of bitcoin without requring the foundation to hire him (open source volunteering on his end as well as monetary compensation with the development of a commencial verson of the open-source software)
Bitcoin voting still runs into all the problems of elections. Its feasible for the code to be used for more secure voting systems but no matter how secure it is democracy sucks.
I agree with him that the blockchain system has far reaching applications beyond just currency. I really need to finish my programming education (or at least get proficent, there is no end to that training) to begin brainstorming the myraid of systems now availables.
The old problems are the ones you cant divorce from bitcoin. I concur. It has many wide reaching applications that arent sufficently considered in their impact. End the Fed is insuffient to understand why this is an important development. I also agree that libertarianism is inherently compatible with bitcoin but that bitcoin isnt inherently libertarian in its political scope.
While carson and rothbard are sort of a biased and limited fellows in this discussion there are many long centuries discussing the political implications of money and they are neglected by the libertarian community.
Personnally I think that there would be much more success for libertarians to achieve their goal if they focus on quantitative goals, look at the problems of bitcoin as a currency, and then realize that its more important for them to focus on bitcoin replacing (or at least pushing for some crypto-currency) the fiat system rather than trying to skip directly to anarcho-capitalism.
I will discuss each point for a moment not to just be some poo-pooer.
1. Quantitative goals.
* a. number of businesses using crypto (I'll substitute crypto for bitcoin since my second point delves into that) regulary.
* b. number of people diversifying into crypto
* c. number of exchanges and merchant portals for crypto transfer
* d. estimated value of total crypto (yes this the one that did get done and its a very powerful emotional statement for the layman, good job)
* e. Number of necessary products being produced and sold via crypto
* f. Number of communities having a non-trivial number of crypto usages
* g. Number of banned goods being purchased using crypto
* h. papers being published about the effect of crypto
* i. amount of resources spent by fed gov to stop it
* j. number of individuals using cryptos primarily
* k. number of nations switching to support of crypto since its superior to their fiat system (and to escapte dollar hegemony)
* l. number of lenders of cryptos coming about.
* m. numder of systems that can finally exist thanks to crypto-currencies (pay for bandwidth torrent, arbirtration agencies, reputation markets, prediciton markets)
three qualifiers
* a. crypto are hard to track so actually finding this data is a quandary. Percentage, estimates, and general personal experience are all you can play with. Just allow a place for the questions to be asked and find ways for the goals to be measured.
* b. Theres going to be some working backwards from stated goals to find out which quantitative questions should be asked
* c. This is by no means an exhuastive list
2. Issues with bitcoin as a currency
* a. transfer from dollar to bitcoin
* b. lack of trusted institutions (open-transactions solves this but then you have to be pro-OT rather than just pro-bitcoin) 
* c. all transaction being on the block chain allows for tracking and waste of time/resources (again OT helps with this)
* d. lack of ease of trade (solved via time and usuage, not a hard limit
* e. fed gov. They dont like it. Comes with the territory so its not a hard limit.
These issues don't kill it however OT and currency competion would be recommend and as such crypto-currency in general with usage of bitcoin or bitcoin protocols would help this is most regards.
3. Make the political statement be trade of currencies and crypto currencies rather than a massive libertarian conversion.
Firstly really easy to see results and to work on, so pragmatic is the best second.
Secondly most people, isaiahs job, dont really care and you cant make them care. Get them to use it and thats all the political action you can expect.
Thirdly it allows remnants to help push many of the things you want for libertopia without the problem that most wont become libertarians nor does it require them to be.
I used to be active on here, gravitating to organic human developments rather than anti-statism, and generally I stick to being a remnant (again isaiahs job) with neoreactionary tendencies. My tribe, nexialism, and virtue, are the focuses I have and after my work on panarchism and digesting of many libertarian works I have empathy for it (from a consequentialist standpoint) but I'm not a libertarian for a variety of pragmatic, consequentialist, philosophical, and dentological reasons that became apparent in my work on panarchy as well as a better understanding of governance and the state as historical systems.
However I am all for currency competiton and I'm no fan of the post-1913 monetary regime. I'm doing everything in my power to get something like OT spread around. I'm also all for pushing real justice (as found in polycentric law) and I see the main issues with regulatory bodies/banking institutions when they have massive control of the monies of a people.
It's not to hard to get me to help out on this issue even if I violently react to attempted libertarian conversion. You'll find a variety of intelligent capable remnants who are probably in the same boat.
The political (ie power) goal to be achived is the adoption of crypto in context of counter economics to allow for the current monetary regime to be sidesteppeed. Thus allowing a monetary system more common pre-1913 and generally giving the populace far more control of their money.
This can lead to the libertarian ideals but the two arent necessarily tied at the hip

OT fixes most of the issues with bitcoin and allows it to be more easily usable. It also fixes the issue of trusted servers.
