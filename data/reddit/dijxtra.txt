Do you have any indications that police might start stealing? Or are you just pulling this out of thin air without knowing the first thing about current situation in Greece?
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:35:16
But how would localbitcoins sellers get the coin? I mean, on LocalBitcoins you can buy only bitcoins which are already inside Greece. That means that supply is 0. If demand starts rising, the price will locally go up and BTC will have higher price in Greece than abroad, which means it ceases to be a efficient way to transfer value...
I just don't get how is bitcoin gonna help Greece.
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:34:47
Is crime rate in Greece so high that citizens are afraid to own cash? That would be quite surprising news.

Bank accounts are not shut down. Banks are closed. The difference is that you can still pay your bills using internet banking. You just cannot send your money abroad. That's what "capital controls" means: you can use the money inside the country, but cannot send it out.
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:33:05
How do you use bitcoin to buy bitcoin? Specifically, let's say you are a bitcoin seller. Customers bought all of your bitcoins and now you need to buy more. How are you going to use bitcoin to bypass capital controls?
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:19:54


Two questions:
1. what about btcgreece.com?
2. is there demand? If a buyer/seller with access to liquidity moved there for the summer, is it your opinion that it would help the situation?
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:42:29


Nope. From Wikipedia: "Capital controls are residency-based measures [...] that a nation's government can use to regulate flows from capital markets into and out of the country's capital account." So, yeah, in a trivial sense "capital controls" means "controls of capital". But, in economy "capital controls" means measures for preventing the flight of capital out of the country, and those measure usually have nothing to do with transactions inside the country.
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:14:15


Yes. Greek cash is euro, and euro is way more stable and way more accepted than bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:39:23
Holding thousands of euros literally under a mattress is less safe than leaving it in the bank, agreed. But holding thousands of euros in an illiquid, volatile and unregulated asset is less safe than holding thousands of euros literally under a mattress, don't you think?
First rule of r/bitcoin is "do not put your life savings into bitcoin". Why does that apply to redditors and not to Greeks?
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:28:05
Sure, but that's not a very sustainable solution, is it? How many tourists does Greece need if, say, 100.000 people want to buy 10k€ each? That's a lot of tourist cash.
And, reality seems to be showing that Greek sellers are quite solvent, LocalBitcoin cash prices are way below market value.
Either there is absolutely no demand for BTC in Greece or sellers have found a way to bypass capital controls.

Oh, beautiful! You're awesome.
Just one thing ;-) Now that you put the icon into notification bar (which is awesome!), there's no visual distinction between pending reminders and completed reminders. How about you change the color from grey to, say, green when the block is reached?

Well, our economy is based on debt. If I start a business, I will in 90% of cases need a loan from a bank. Whether that loan is in USD or BTC is irrelevant, isn't it? As for p2p loans, that's great for microfinancing, but when you need a $10b loan for a nuclear power plant, I don't see any way of funding that except by a central institution which first collects smaller deposits and then reissues those as debt - which is a definition of a bank (be it a BTC bank or otherwise).


With just the same mechanisms as they are fixing prices of EUR or USD (which is what this journalist is ranting about). What's the difference? Currency exchange is a currency exchange, be it USD/EUR, BTC/USD or BTC/DOGE. I'd be quite surprised if you haven't heard of , for instance, pump and dump, which is the easiest one to pull off.


I'm not doing that comparison. Currency does not run the economy. Banks run the economy. Banks could run the economy on USD, JPY, EUR or BTC, it doesn't matter really. You seem to implicate that bitcoin is in fact more than just a payment network and a currency that bitcoin is a banking system, or something like that. Could you elaborate a bit more on that?
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:38:16

I think you haven't spent that much time at I'd say most people there are in it for the fun, not the profit.

Imagine this subreddit if BTC was crashing like that... last time it happened people were talking suicide here.

Well, what you describe is called "mutual savings bank". A bunch of people you don't know or trust get together, form a mutual savings bank and issue loans to other people. All profits are owned by members of the mutual savings bank. What's the difference between the programmable money you describe and a mutual savings bank? What new possibilities does it offer?
And now my point: if there is no difference between "programmable money" and a mutual savings bank, then why would bitcoin solve a problem that mutual savings banks didn't?




That was just one example. Wait, are you trying to say that bitcoin trading will not be susceptible to manipulation when it grows to the size of forex essentially because forex cannot be manipulated? Did I get that right?






No, I am aware of how bitcoin protocol works, I run a bitcoin company :-D I just find your claims about new possibilities that bitcoin brings quite exaggerated. I mean, if bitcoin can replace banking system - hey man, I want my startup to be a part of that :-D But I just don't see how the "programmable money" aspect of bitcoin can replace banking sector, and your examples do not seem to help me.

An android block notifier would be great. You set it like "6 block from now", and the phone starts ringing after 6 blocks are produced.
It would be great for those times when you wait for your btc to show up on an exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:51:27
Well, yeah, as says: Now they say it is a "money surrogate", which basically means it is money-like, "almost like money".
So, you cannot do barter with it since it is "almost like money", and you cannot use it as money since only allowed money in Ukraine is hryvnia.
This is not uncommon, a lot of countries has taken this approach. Russia, for instance.
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:20:02

Well, depends on the context. Is it illegal to own BTC in Russia? No. Is it illegal to pay for things using BTC in Russia? Mostly yes (with exceptions). Complicated question, that one.
BTW, BTC-e is registered on Cyprus, it has a bank account in Czech Republic and a HQ in Bulgaria. It's only connection to Russia is that BTC-e founders have russian sounding pseudonimes (Aleksey and Alexander - probably not their real names).
@_date: 2014-10-24 04:19:30
That exactly was my point, yes. Bitstamp et al are already behaving somewhat like banks. That means that bitcoin will likely not only not destroy banking system - it is quite likely that banking will infiltrate bitcoin.
There is absolutely no mechanism in bitcoin protocol that prevents the next logical step: Circle or Coinbase offering interest on deposits and lending BTC with interest. If that happens, it would not surprise me at least if Circle and Coinbase started issuing promissory notes on behalf of their depositors, but denominated in fiat to prevent volaility. And from promissory notes, it is all downhill down to BTC backed electronic money.
I don't see how it can be prevented in the free market - the only hope for right-wing bitcoiners that banking system will not infiltrate BTC is - ironically - government regulation.

Wow, that was fast :-) Thanks a bunch. I'm testing it right now.
First of all, great clean design. Nice.
How often does the app check for new blocks? Could you allow us to customize it? That would be really great. Also, it would be really nice to have a list of all active reminders. Those two are some basic features I'd really like to see.
Your first donation of 10 bucks is on the way ;-)
Now, as for super-cool features that would be cool to have, here are some:
* an icon in notification bar while there are active reminders
* "X block to go" for each reminder in above mentioned list of all active remindes
* said list of all active remindes available in notification area (like unread email list)
Again, thanks for this app, I Shirely will be using it!
Testing went great. Notifier works even through a corporate firewall, which is nice. Only one minor suggestion: it's be nice if the icon didn't have background. It's more in line with other Android icons. Just white hammers would be just fine.
Anyway, great app! If you include some more features, I'll be donating some more ;-) Now I'll share this app with all my friends.

Yes, you can put it that way.

Wouldn't it be much easier to doublespend like this:
1. Spend an address to another address you control
2. Wait a minute for transaction to propagate
3. Go and pay your bill from the already spet address
Your first transaction will probably not be confirmed before step 3, but will propagate enough for miners to reject the second transaction. I'd say that's a quite easy way to screw over the merchant. Am I missing something?

What do you propose we do? Bitcoin is just a payment protocol and a currency, we still need banks to run the economy. Don't we? I mean, the issue here is that big players fixed the price. Bitcoin has the same problem: few whales can fix the price of BTC with ease.
So, bitcoin is obviously not the solution for price fixing. You say "no" to regulation (which means no to banning price fixing, right?). So, what do you propose?
Damn, I should work on my discourse. Excuse my tone, I'm not trying to pick a fight, I'm genuinely interested in your ideas.
@_date: 2014-10-21 04:09:03
Well, Mt.Gox did fractional reserve, didn't it?
I don't understand how is bitcoin different from cash here. Cash also cannot be duplicated, but it can be lent so it has multiple owners. Same goes for BTC, I give my BTC to BitBank for 5% annual interest, BitBank gives 90% those BTC to you for 7% annual interest. Now that bitcoins have two owners. Clasical reserve banking and I just don't see mechanisms in bitcoin protocol for preventing this.
So, could you please elaborate little further or link to a relevant article?
Edit: sorry, now I see this has already been discussed. Anyway, I really would like to find someone who knows what he's talking about to explain to me how btc prevents fractional reserve, since I with my Coursera level understanding of banking and finance just don't see it.

@_date: 2014-09-11 04:26:46
Yeah. But 13 of those countries already have 0% end-to-end remittance with zero spending limits. So it's more of a 2% end-to-end remittance between 2 banking networks (US and SEPA).

If I understand correctly, you are saying that btc market cap has to increase to allow for huge transactions. I see two problems with that.
First, huge transactions can be split. One huge transaction can be split in 100 consecutive transactions. Alice buys 100 BTC for 600 bucks, sends them to Bob, Bob sells those back to 600 bucks, and then they repeat that 99 times and they have transferred 60000 dollars without anybody noticing.
Second, why would the need for higher market cap increase the market cap? It seems to me causation is skewed here. Market cap has to increase for larger transactions to be possible. Ok, cool. But, why would that fact increase maket cap? Why wouldn't the rich guys simply use wire transfers?
I feel that's like saying that FED will surely introduce a 100 million dollar bill, because transactions in billions of dollars are not practical with 100 dollar bills. Sure, 100 dollar bills are impractical for large transactions, that's why they are not used for large transactions. Bitcoin is not practical for large transactions - so the logical conclusion is that it won't be used for large transactions. I jist don't see why would market cap increase simply because large transactions are not possible.

I have trouble figuring out where is the part with the smart contract. I see an "oracle" being the escrow service, but I do not see any kind of contract stored in the blockchain, just ordinary 2-of-3 escrow. It is true that two parties do not need to trust each other, but both parties trust the oracle. So where is the trustless smart contract here? Can you show it to us in the blockchain?

You sure? I'd say they made it property, not commodity. Difference is  in interchangability - IRS requires you to book every fraction of bitcoin you bought, whereas commodity can be booked as average price. That is my understanding, at least.
@_date: 2015-09-21 07:51:08
"They didn't really make it anything. They said treat it like property for tax purposes, they didn't declare what it is."
Of course. IRS does not have magical powers of turning stuff into something else. That was a figure of speech.
"Since bitcoin isn't a precious metal, and isn't a foreign issued national currency then it falls into the everything else category. It's baffling to me how so many on this sub are intent on being misinformed and confused about something so damn rudimentary"
That's because it isn't so damn rudimentary. I, for one, am a bitcoin entrepreneur in Croatia, I have corresponded long and hard with Croatian tax service and they decided in my favour: they declared, sorry, decided to treat bitcoin as foreign currency although the law clearly says that treatment is reserved strictly for foreign issued currencies and bitcoin is clearly not issued. Tax service noted all that and decided that law doesn't make sense in this case and effectively decided to publish an illegal decision.
So, once you descend into real world from pedestals of internet commentary - nothing is rudimentary and everything is complicated.

Well, from that article I gatheret 3 distinct points:
1. CNB did not issue an oppinion
2. CNB does not have an opinion
3. bitcoin cannot be used in Croatia
Ad 1. This article does not reference any oficial CNB statement, the journalists obviously just talked to somebody inside the institution who gave them some informal opinions. If those opinions indeed are not oficial, then they are not binding and can change any moment.
Ad 2. "CNB, therefore, **does not define** bitcoin either as **a currency** [...] nor as **electronic money**, but they point to the opinion of ECB from 2012. by the title "Virtual currency schemes"." - this efectively means CNB does not have an opinion. They are pointing to an ECB whitepaper which also is not a legal document, but just a study. If you haven't read it, I suggest you do, it's a good read.
Ad 3. "Accoding to Law on CNB, the only official currency is kuna [...]"
Therefore, the way I read this article, it says that the journalist just asked somebody in CNB what he thinks about bitcoin, and the person unoficilay gave him one general sentence without being specific. I'd say that declaring bitcoin "legal in Croatia" is a bit overly optimistic.
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:10:10


The document says "No capital gains tax for **selling** bitcoin." Just saying, don't know if that's relevant.






All of this is taxed according to "Law on income". Therefore, bitcoin mining is treated as income, and gains from bitcoin trading are taxed as income.
I think this is bad since profits from trading are going to be taxed as income, not as capital gains, which means higher taxes.

@_date: 2013-12-20 18:20:33
That was 3 days ago. Things changed since then.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:39:33
Ah, now I get it. Yeah, I already have bitcoin paranoid. Sadly, they do not offer a widget, but thanks anyway.

So, any merchant can accept barter in your country? How about paying your employees? We had quite a fuss in Croatia when the biggest merchant in Croatia started paying his employees in coupons which can only be spent in his stores. I was under impression that was illegal in Croatia, I'll doublecheck right now.
edit: checked - [our law explicitly prohibits paying workers in coupons](

That's not what the article says. Can you point me to the part of the article that says "official"?


Institutions give their opinions in form of a document. Not every person working for CNB has the right to issue official statements in the name of CNB, that's why institutions issue their opinions as documents signed by a person which has the right to speak for the institution. So, if this is an official opinion of CNB, then there is a document signed by the governor of CNB. If there is no such document, the it is not an opinion of the institution, but of a man working for the institution, which is a big difference.


Yeah, but the article does not even quote CNB as saying that, they do it indirectly. So, we have a situation of a journalist indirectly paraphrasing an unindentified person working for CNB. And the indirect paraphrase just "points" to the ECB opinion. I'd say that's as weak a statement as it could be.
They also point to Croatian laws and regulations by saying that those do not allow bitcoin to be used.


Not true. In USA you can pay with whatever you wish. If a McDonalds in NY takes Euros, you can pay in Euros. The only official status that dollar has is that taxes can only be paid in USD, which makes it legal tender. US does not have an official currency in a sense that Croatia has. Where are you getting all this misinformation from?


International transactions are a completely different matter. They have nothing to do with legality of bitcoin in Croatia.


Now you are to the point: we don't know what this statement means, and all of this indeed is your interpretation of a comment of an unnamed person from CNB.

No more deposits using 3rd party services. Only using bank accounts.

Black market is quite big in croatian tourist accomodation industry. They will be happy to take euros, but you won't get a receipt. If they do give you a receipt, it will be in kunas.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:15:20
You sure? Because he says exactly the opposite, if I read that correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:04:23
Croatia - 
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:11:37
All profits are taxed as income.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:42:21
Yeah, that's what we're waiting for, in fact. Tax guidelines. Those will determine the future of btc in Croatia.

Isn't shorting illegal or something? (I obviously do not know much about finance)
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:08:52
They obviously do not know what they are talking about. I'd say the title is misleading.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:10:51
It's called "pegged currency". Better part of this Wikipedia article is on that subject: 
I'd say Peter Schiff has some Wikipedia reading to do.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:02:40
**Images** add a lot to the article.
Ideas for images:
* screenshots of bitcoinsharts (bitcoinsharts is CC BY-SA, therefore acceptable for wikipedia)
* screenshots of wallets
* screenshot of an exchange marketplace (
* photograph of people using bitcoin-qt (a guy in front of a computer screen)
* a photo of a smartphone with Mycelium or something
* a photo of a meetup (somebody on r/bitcoin must attend meetups, take a group photo)

I do not realise this. That's my point the whole time. We have no guarantee that the person giving comment has the authority or that it was not given lightly. That's my point.
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:50:01
Nope, I doubt that journalist made it all up, I was more concerned that the person in CNB was speaking off the record. I do not have personal experience with CNB employees, but I do have experience with Croatian government, and they quite often change their official opinion, which makes their unofficial opinions even more unreliable, even worthless...
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:57:26
Sure. I'm well aware I can legally use bitcoin for selling my friend my used laptop. But, when I go to McDonalds, McD has to (by law) accept only our national currency, at least in our country. That's what I'm confused about.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:08:51


Agreed. But professionalism is not that common in croatian journalism, so I juat do not count on it a priori.


I was not aware of that.


By "ECB recommendations" you mean that whitepaper on virtual currencies, or some other document? Because the whitepaper in question is quite vague...
@_date: 2013-12-28 12:37:52
Ah, cool. But, yeah, then you are not selling **to** Bobby off the books, but **through** Bobby off the books. Sorry for nitpicking :-( I'll downovote myself out.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:24:14
Yeah, but that's besides the point. Just replace "euro" with "dollar" in my question.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:47:50
Yeah, I understand why money is practical, it just surprises me that the government hasn't prohibited barter in stores.
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:52:54
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:55:34
That simply is not true, at least not for all jurisdictions. If you accept payment with euros in a shop in Croatia, you get fined. The only legal mean of payment is Croatian kuna.
It's a common annoyance for tourists who come from other EU countries and try to pay in euros. The merchant would be very happy to accept euros, but he is not allowed by law. So, your statement is not true.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:52:53
Can you give us any primary sources? Any CNB statemets? Because, that's not how I understood the news.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:30:15
Wow. What country is that? Do you have VAT?
So, in theory, you could all just switch to barter and get rid of VAT? (in theory)
This question gets more interesing every moment :-D
