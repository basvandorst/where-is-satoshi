More importantly how do you lose money in a market that is impossible to lose money in. Are you sure you didn't miss place it? My nan does that with her glasses all the time.

Who is the irs? Isnt that taxs for usa? Why do i need to contact them? I keep all my accounts for in the uk. Everything is up to date. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:57:50
Shift card looks good but I am in the UK so would be charged 3% on every transaction. Interface and linking to coinbase is a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:53:10
fuck the banks, they don't deserve to get in on this wonderful new tech. They fucked the fiat system. They cant fuck this one also. The tax system will need to change. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:54:38
Id still buy at 25k if im converting my monthly salary into BTC :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:24:18
Congrats! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:58:54
any idea where or who?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:43:39
Not very smart if wanting to sell to be honest. I mean i don't want to sell my holdings but want to use it also. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:49:04
Ditto, Inflation and the fact its price is determined by the powerful few. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:53:47
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:42:56
yeah if it works... it works :D
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:18:00
I agree with them. Hope im not going to regret this lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:18:30
My ebay listings have gone up to fund more bitcoin :D
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:56:49
I did this 4 weeks ago. I don't regret it. I took out a 10k loan over 10years 4.5% APR. Good luck with your investment.

@_date: 2017-12-18 19:32:00
If you read the post im putting money aside for my direct debits such as rent loans etc. Im not fully invested in this but i want to test how robust the card is and if its actually worth buying btc to store and spend. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:49:03
BUT THE IMAGE ON THE PHONE SAYS BTC AND NOT BHC? I didn't realise how bad this all ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:19:49
yeah Im predicting that around late 2018 possible early 19. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:14:44
Thanks! Will have a look through the content. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:16:29
No the fee would be to move BTC to tenx. Thats the only BTC transfer fee i would need to pay. 
When i spend my money on the card i actually get reward points and the fee to have the digital card on my phone is $1.50 yearly or if i want a printed card its $15 yearly. Cheaper than my bank and i get rewarded in currency every purchase i make lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:31:38
spot on, best write up iv seen about this. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:03:56
Im glad its gone down... It was going up way too fast for my liking :P

For VAT purposes Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies will be treated as follows below, this in no way reflects on how they are treated for regulatory or other purposes:
MINING BITCOINS
*Income received from Bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT on the basis that the activity does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes because there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received.*
*income received from Bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT on the basis that the activity does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes because there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received*
So miners don't need to pay tax on mined coins?
TRADING BITCOINS
*CT - the profits or losses on exchange movements between currencies are taxable. For the tax treatment of virtual currencies, the general rules on foreign exchange and loan relationships apply. We have not at this stage identified any need to consider bespoke rules. For companies, exchange movements are determined between the company’s functional currency (usually the currency in which the accounts are prepared) and the other currency in question. If there is an exchange rate between Bitcoin and the functional currency then this analysis applies. Therefore no special tax rules for Bitcoin transactions are required. The profits and losses of a company entering into transactions involving Bitcoin would be reflected in accounts and taxable under normal CT rules.*
*IT - the profits and losses of a non-incorporated business on Bitcoin transactions must be reflected in their accounts and will be taxable on normal IT rules.*
*Chargeable gains: CT and CGT - if a profit or loss on a currency contract is not within trading profits or otherwise within the loan relationship rules, it would normally be taxable as a chargeable gain or allowable as a loss for CT or CGT purposes. Gains and losses incurred on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are chargeable or allowable for CGT if they accrue to an individual or, for CT on chargeable gains if they accrue to a company.*
So normal tax's are applied for investments that are made into crypto on profit and losses. What declares if the investment was a gamble? Buying in below $1 or below $0.50? Gambling investments are not taxable? 
Also what if you move your profits from one coin into another investment which is considered a gamble?

Do you mind sharing with me how the shift card works? I take it you store your BTC on a wallet they own then when you make a payment it gets exchanged and the payment goes through and the BTC is deducted from your wallet on the switch app? Do you get charged per conversion/payment? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:36:04
Thanks for your words of support. Yes same for me. Iv done very well from crypto like many others and i think its here to stay so lets start using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:23:11
I ordered my card (charged $15) and transferred £200 to my account. Lets hope bitcoin goes up haha... Im on a waiting list so not sure how long it will be be until i get my card... good job i got fiat for the time being. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:09:37
There will only be one transfer fee and thats the initial fee to transfer my money from my BTC wallet to my TenX BTC wallet. Once its on the TenX card there are no more fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:11:34
I store my BTC on TenX it converts it to the Fiat needed on checkout. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:00:55
lol im going to start by keeping things simple. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:26:15
Looking into Monaco. Also my friend who has been doing this for 8months said hes also using Xapo. So will look into that also
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:16:47
TenX keeps a log of it all. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:08:56
Your only fucked if the repayments are more than you can afford. If you can make the repayments HODL and wait for it to go back up. Also if you are not young do not do this. Make sure you will be working during the years of the loan repayment. Calculate your risks. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:19:08
Thanks. People laughed at me when I took a loan out and put it into Bitcoin... All il say is they are not laughing now. :P
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:50:30
So if leave my crypto in crypto format i don't need to pay taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:50:09
Id obviously be holding another btc wallet with my savings in so im just spending my monthly money as usual and keeping my savings tucked away.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:37:23
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:55:48
Nice so if i withdraw from within the uk with a uk card i wont be charged any fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:41:39
HMRC are fuckers and know they will come back and bite you in the ass even if you stick within their rules. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:24:54
I took out a loan to buy into cryptos and its done me very well. I never intend on cashing out my profits, i see it as making the first move to set my self up for the big switch in the near future. I believe in the tech and want it to work and i can see it working. I predicted 10 years but now im thinking closer to 5.  
A bubble is created when investors want to cash out. 
I think people will cash out from greed but more will buy back driving the price up. Also as 'cryptos' increase in value and the overall market cap increases fiat currencies will gradual devalue. :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:49:34
Id be spending what i need (using BTC) and making money at the same time as all my funds would be in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:25:16
If i received that letter id ring them up, transfer all my money out of the bank and shut it the fuck down.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:48:10
Can you link me to the sub please as im going to need as much help as i can get. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:10:10
Basically spot on from what I understand also. ATM Fees $2.50, paying on card free. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:56:29
please read the post properly and do your research on the topic before commenting nonsense. thanks.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:43:35
probably not :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:06:27
They are recorded within TenX automatically so I have a record. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:04:55
no, From what I understand I need to transfer my BTC to my TenX account. Once the BTC is on my TenX account they deduct BTC from it when I make a payment.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:08:30
I'm not nervous, maybe a tad but I fully believe this is going to change a lot of things moving forward. I'm probably more deluded than nervous lol. My loan was a 10 year planned loan and its well within my monthly expenditure as I fully believe don't spend what you cant afford. If the market crashes i'm just going to hold and buy more if I can. If I have made a stupid amount i'l pay off the loan early and live a little easier. The loan would have been towards house improvements/alterations so i guess i'm gambling that. I can live without the open plan extension and a lick of paint. Also I'm growing quite fond of my 80's style carpets!
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:41:45
You might be right, but at the moment paying purely in BTC is just not practical enough. But surely converting my money into BTC and using it daily by spending it is helping BTC buy moving it around rather than just buying it and dumping it in cold storage? Unless TenX is just dumping everything they get into cold storage it has to be beneficial to BTC until a better solution becomes available?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:28:19
Sorry to hear about this... but yeah this isn't Bitcoin's fault.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:24:09
what fees are you referring to? If i take money out at a cash machine il be charged.... If i spend on my card I will only be charged the equivalent in BTC. 
Foreign Exchange Fee	0%
ATM Fee	EUR 2.75*
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:26:34
The amount of work done all of last week is close to 0 thanks to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:16:14
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:19:22
Thanks will have a look.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:51:30
not sure. Im keeping records of my purchases and sales just in case they decide to be dicks about it lol
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:20:43
It's totally working... People are buying into Bitcoin. Its for investment currently because there are not that many uses for it yet but this will change. The money I have put in now is typically an investment but I intend to hodl until I can just start using my cryptos to replace fiat. I don't really intend on taking it out in pounds or dollars. I know this isn't everyones thoughts but hey, they are in it and learning about it. Better than not at all.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:05:30
Right that makes sense. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:50:54
its different in the uk. 
When we get paid the tax is deducted automatically. 
When we buy in a shop the tax is added to the price alreaady.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:21:34
Yes, but the value of bitcoin is going up at the moment and probably will be for a while. So im better off putting my money into BTC and spending what I need. At the end of the month if its gone up I win. If its gone down I lose. For this to work I need BTC will be going up in value otherwise im loosing out on beer money!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:57:23
Your physical money isn't even real. the paper it self is totally worthless. A man in a tower says your $5 is worth what its worth.

the majority of people wont buy into this until its easy to do. It's still quite complex. Probably going to be another 5-10 years before this is a normal thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:00:32
By changing the finance system we will change/fix the government system. Its a win win. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:51
Cos its easy as hell to sign up and start using it. It's great for an introduction platform. I started on it with my first few buys. But there are cheaper ways to buy in. You will find what works for you over time.

Stop paying Coinbase fees... use Gemini instead :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:20:46
it has fees just reasonable :P
