I find the whole situation a total spin out from an Australians point of view. The government has basically tanked the country it seems. I don't claim to know what's going on just reading about it. Its good Bitcoin is offering options for payment at least. We all walk around with paper and plastic in our wallets. It's worthless when you think about it, it only holds value cause we are told valuable. Best of luck OP.

The government and tax office are on a huge cash grab. They are basically taxing, fining and Robo debiting anyone they can. It's not a good look it wreaks of desperation, we must be in shit bad ��
If you're not from Australia google Robo debt, it's way worse than this shit. In short, they send you a bill and say "prove you don't owe this". So they don't show or tell you how they got that figure, you have to prove them wrong!
 If you can't they send debt collection....
