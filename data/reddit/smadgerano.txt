OK, thanks for that. But others do.
Also, it has been, and will continue to be a "battleground" in the media for the foreseeable future. For an organisation such as this to release reports almost rubbishing some of that narrative is worth taking note of.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:19:14
The reason so much attention is on energy, is because..
1) People's basic understanding is that it uses a lot of it to secure and  run the network.
2) We have had warnings from scientists that we as a race must reduce our energy consumption or bad things happen.
3) Visa and others have actively engaged in advertising campaigns explicitly stating Bitcoin is bad because it uses too much energy,
...so of course people are going to focus on it. But here you are, the IEA, an internationally recognized and respected organization and *the* authority on energy production and consumption, coming out with the following....
1) They understand and don't downplay the importance of PoW
2) They debunk media information of ridiculous energy usage
3) They correspond with our own communities research and findings for the amount of renewable energy used to run the network, further validating our existing arguments.
4) Suggest that because the very nature of mining is fluid and can relocate to the closest and cheapest energy source, they are in a way early adopters for large scale industrial renewable energy. 
What more could you ask for when having logical grown-up discussions with others? 
And on a side note, anybody who dismisses the argument of energy consumption as not relevant (I appreciate that was not yourself) can fuck right off.  I'm just sick of people with this viewpoint, or that it's not valid because we *need* PoW, you're doing more harm than good, because those outside of the community who don't "get it" are not going to convinced by the argument that it's not a conversation worth having, that isn't going to work, simple.
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:32:25
Yeah I'm actually a little shocked. I follow the IEA quite closely for personal and professional reasons. In my opinion they're a valid organisation whose opinion I respect. Even then, I did not think they would cover the topic in the way they did.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:55:31
Yes, but the report highlights that the mining economy is highly fluid in terms of location, and that as renewable energy prices drop mining operations can quickly move to take advantage of that.
Effectively these guys are pioneers of sourcing cheap renewable energy. It's an interesting way to look at the market forces.
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:53:01
You're missing the point. It doesn't matter diddly sqwat if I worry about it or not. The argument being made against Bitcoin in the media is that it ***IS*** a problem. Unless we have credible sources for a counter argument then the average Joe will believe them. You can't win an argument by walking off with your fingers in your ears singing "it doesn't matter".
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:27:48
Key points I've found so far....
Around 75% of energy consumed by the network is renewable.
" Sensational predictions about bitcoin consuming the entire world’s electricity – and, by itself, leading our world to beyond 2°C – would appear just that…sensational. "
"bitcoin mining is likely responsible for 10‑20 Mt CO2 per year, or 0.03-0.06% of global energy-related CO2 emissions."
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:58:44
At least there are reports such as this one, from credible sources such as the IEA, that we can use as counter arguments with logic and reason that people can, and should trust more.
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:09:27
Definitely, it's good to see recognized and reputable independent organizations coming to to the same conclusions as those in our own community. It lends huge weight when we have these discussions.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:50:29
They do mention miners using excess renewable energy that would have been lost. The logical argument from that is that it creates true market demand for renewable energy, forcing competition and innovation.

Not really, purely because nothing is finished yet so I wouldn't want to give stuff that's not been checked.
But I am really interested in where you work, and the sort of questions and hurdles your organization might have about the process? It's always good to get the views of people at different points of the chain!

I need help, yes, because at the moment it's just me and I can't do everything on my own, as much as I am trying!
I'm actively working on the site, communications, dealing with organisations and people in the suplpy chains, and investing my own money so that professional coders make something that works and is secure - I'm not a coder so would not want to assume I can do these things correctly, even if it took me longer.
I'm spending my own money in a number of ways to try and make something good happen, and I believe I'm being open and honest about what people would get in return if they wanted to help. I'd love to pay you out of my own pocket, but I can't. And there is a lot more to what I'm trying to do that just a simple website.
Why would it have to be converted in to dollars? There are a number of cryptocurrency payment solutions already being used, and more are coming
Why do you assume that there wont be others in the charity's supply chain that are looking into this same topic and are willing to accept crypto as a form of payment?
To be completely honest if you're expecting to get a reward for charity, it's not charity.

It is growing fast, but that doesn't mean anything other than a lot of people are interested in trying it out, not that it's a stable product ready to integrate into a wallet that has a reputation for stability and could risk losing it.
Elizabeth Stark has warned many times that LND is not finished, expect bugs, expect things to break, expect to lose money! Yes there are other bolt protocol services, but they all have bugs.
Is it not better to give it a bit more time, for the bugs to be ironed out, the protocols to be thoroughly tested, and the network capacity to grow before integrating it so that when people do use for the first time it has a better chance of working?
Simply put you don't ship a beta feature into a production product.
People are in such hurry with this stuff, but for what, and whose benefit?

Hey guys, not trying to be negative, we've all been around a while and know the game :) but it just erks me to see all the new "traders" coming in because the message about using BTC for daily use is getting lost.

I was just trying to list all the ways traditional banking is using resources and energy, and using animal fat is something that seems a little pointless. Doesn't assume that everyone has to be vegan at all, the story was front page news in the UK a while back.
Credit card machines still use power and have to be plugged in to the mains, not suggesting they are power hogs, but they are part of the infrastructure to keep the system running.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:45:30
I'm not arguing for them in any way, but doesn't anybody agree that we should all be actively looking for ways to reduce power consumption - maybe proof of stake, maybe another proof system, who knows - but to dismiss their point straight up is not winning the argument and will not convince others.
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:49:55
Careful, depending on your outlook on crypto this could go down a few different ways looking at the current market, low volume, flat price etc.
If you're one of the people that believe the banks and traditional financial systems are devious &amp;£ then they could come out and say it's not happening after getting hopes up and "force" the price lower.
Or if you're one of the more positive people then this might be welcome news and genuinely be a signal for adoption.
Or if you couldn't give a crap and think the existing systems all need to crumble to be replaced with "decentralised and private everything", then why the hell are you reading this thread, what do you care?
Basically, any shit could happen.

I don't know enough about this topic, but is there a chance that this could be an external attack of some kind?
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:01:52
We can't just dismiss this attack, otherwise we lose the argument for those who are swayed by it. I propose a response similar to this.
Ask yourselves how much energy and resources it takes to create and distribute a new bank note into circulation. What percentage of the new UK notes are made from animals. How much electricity does it take for the VISA system to run. How many cash machines stay on globally 24/7. How many credit card machines at retail outlets run all day, every day. What server infrastructure is required for banks to process transactions. How much energy is used physically transporting cash from the shop to the bank, from the bank to the ATMs. How much plastic is used and wasted producing credit and debit cards that have to be replaced every 3 years because they "expire" etc
Is that any more or less than the amount of energy and resources needed to run the bitcoin network for all of us who have our own bank on our phones?

Don't forget that if op's trying to be private they'll need to generate a new address for every pay check, which could be a bit of a pain for your employer. Otherwise they're repeat using the same address which is a privacy no-no. They might find themselves in a trade off between privacy and acceptance from their employer.
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:34:34
In what way, version number? Just because something is labelled as release 0.x.x does not mean it's in beta, it's just a release number, lots of software follows that numbering structure.
Something running on the testnet is more likely to be beta, which is where LND was released for but people took it and ran it on the mainnet against the release notes and recommendations.
Unless you are defining "beta" by another metric?
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:33:12
Errr... Maybe just stop referring to it all as "trading" and complicating things. You're confusing two seperate use cases, actual trading, and ATMs / getting cash out of their accounts (from the average Joe perspective)
For newcomers who might just want to convert some of their BTC to fiat so they can spend money in places that don't accept it, that is the meaning of an ATM. That is the purpose of your machines. Not trading. Not a vending machines.
We get it, we know what's going on, but we need to break down the barriers for newcomers, which means simplifying things and sticking to accepted terms.
In most western countries right now we need people to adopt crypto as a regular currency by actually paying for things, not speculation and trading.
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:01:49

Well, I agree with you, and I cannot answer you how it was done, but what I would say is have they inaccurately banned anybody for "their friend gambling?"

I hate to be that guy, and let me be absolutely clear before I continue that I do not believe my next statement is right, proper, correct or how the crpto space should behave or react, but as an opposing view...
If there is a law in your part of the world that says you cannot purchase crypto for the purpose of gambling, you agreed to terms and conditions when signing up to a platform, and you have intentionally broken that law and terms, what do you expect? If there is a law against something, they're just covering their backs - how do you think Coinbase has managed to get to the level it has without cooperating to some extent with the regulatory authorities?
Again, I am not saying I agree with this view or endorse it, just offering a counter argument.

The only way to maintain a level of anonymity whilst remaining in the ecosystem from start to finish is to mine the coin to begin with, use multiple addresses where appropriate, and wait for layer two solutions.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:38:11
It is difficult, but if you run your own node and wallet you're halfway there.
The only real way to do it from start to finish within the current ecosystem is to mine the coin to begin with, but that's pretty hard with the huge centralised mining operations to compete with.
If you purchase with cash then you still run the risk of the other party's coins being tracked.
Or wait for the second layer / privacy solutions.
Or use a coin with privacy built in to the protocol.
The whole thing depends on how much privacy you're prepared to sacrifice for the ease of use, just like using Google or Facebook.
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:09:32
The point of one crypto is different to another.
In the case of Bitcoin, the point is to be a "system for electronic transactions without relying on trust", nothing more. The fact that all transactions are open to everyone is a byproduct of using the distributed ledger.
But you are correct about keeping your addresses and keys private.
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:47:09
What does a profit-orientated third-party organisation care for what crypto "stands for" to you? 
Have they ever marketed themselves as offering a service based on those ideals of "crypto-privacy"? 
You have voluntarily provided your name, address, phone number, email address, and ID. Seriously, what do you expect? You can't go screaming that your privacy is under threat after giving them these details, and I'm guessing your consent for them to do it by agreeing to the T&amp;C's in the first place.
If you want privacy, why are you using a third party?
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:05:28
Where does it say in the "crypto manifesto" what the spirit is?
The only mention of privacy in the Nakamoto white paper is a comparison against the level achieved by the then current banking system, and how a similar level can be accomplished (given that the blockchain flies in the face of privacy by it's very nature) by using unique addresses where appropriate, and not revealing private keys. 
From the whitepaper : "The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner." - the dude surrendered at least 2 types of identifiable information when signing up to use this third party, don't complain when it turns out you don't have any privacy.

Ok fair point, but should that be the norm? I can't think of a better way of putting this so apologies if it comes across bluntly - at what level is  one deemed to be knowledgeable enough to operate a node? You're effectively saying that for those who do not put time and personal resources into something they should be discouraged from using it. How about those, like my mother, who are interested in all the benefits but cannot for the life of her cannot understand how "all the gubbins underneath" work on a fairly intricate scale, are they to be discouraged from running a node and not supporting the network? As long as the end user is allowed to operate the node in any way they see fit, what is the problem of allowing third parties make life easier - if anything it's our duty to enable users who do not understand, a way to actively participate.
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:19:55
But it really doesn't have to, a low power ARM chip like a Raspberry Pi will happily cope, it's the RAM and storage requirements that might mean it's a little inadequate, but if you add external storage that should be fine.

First of all, I know this isn't a particularly scientific study, it's just an observation pieced together from [ data, even so I don't understand what's happening with Bitcoin nodes right now.
Since 13th November, there has been a sharp increase in the number of nodes running version 0.14.99, changing from 75 to 719.
Why is this?
Yes, the price began to crash on the 13th November, so you could argue that it was holders bringing nodes back online to transfer funds. But if that was the case I'd expect a similar increase in activity from other versions, instead there is a small increase in some, whilst others are most likely updating to newer versions.
If it was a collection of miners bringing old equipment back online, why would they do it? The price was incredibly low, the difficulty is high, and they are bound to lose money.
Going back over the last two years, the highest number of nodes running this version (and again I know this isn't scientific) there was never a large ramp up like the last two weeks, and the highest number was 205 around August 2017.
This seems odd behavior, someone, or collection of people are deliberately spinning up an extra 650 nodes, either for the first time or that appear to have been dormant for quite some time, with an outdated version, just as the market is crashing.
I do not know enough about this, but what was special about 0.14.99?
Am I being paranoid that it is about the same time that Craig Wright claimed he could screw the network, and perhaps he has found a potential bug or flaw in old version?
Or is there another explanation that I'm not aware of?

I'm not saying you're wrong, but I've not seen this approach / theory discussed anywhere regarding who "shouldn't" run a node before, have you got links?
But other than the possibility of someone else taking control of your node, what are the other dangers to the network for users running nodes "irresponsibly"? Surely the more node operators there are the more  they mitigate those potential pseudo-attacks, whilst at the same time improving the network as a whole?
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:01:52
Not exactly sure how a node can be run that harms the network, other than having to keep it updated, just like all the software you run on your laptop / phone/ rpi / server / tablet etc.
Either way it's a chicken and egg situation, you learn by doing, and if you're saying the the network is so fragile that it cannot handle basic "muppet attacks" then we've all been duped. Look at the stats for bitcoind and the versions being run - the network handles this fine.

Even if you know nothing about the tech, you should take it as a personal responsibility to run a full node. People confuse this with mining too often and ignore it, but it costs you nothing, you support the network, and it's easy as pie. Even if you only care about your gains, running a node is important.

Ok my wording was not great, and perhaps my point was not well made, what I'm trying to say is we don't really know how much a bitcoin should be worth, yes you can use the argument of how much electricity it costs to mine etc, but I think the jury is till out on that one, we're nowhere near any kind of meaningful adoption yet, and so how do we determine not only what the price should be but weather a certain level of negatively is warranted or not compared to that price. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:56:04
This has become the norm, UK papers that have a strong history of standards have lost some of their editorial QA over the recent years, probably because they're in such a rush to get content out on the web. I've seen it in The Times, The Independent, The Guardian and pretty much all the others too.
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:49:17
How are you working out how much negativity is warranted? (not being a dick, genuinely interested)
We're at $3900, just stop and think about that for a second, $3900! That's insane for any asset. There is an argument to say that we're not negative enough. So how are you determining what is warranted (again not being a dick )
@_date: 2018-12-29 13:15:08
That's a pretty far fetched claim to make though - you are assuming that all money on the dark market is somehow dirty, which is not true, and in the use case of selling legal goods through an alternative marketplace would then make any clean money dirty, which again isn't true.
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:36:06
Yes, because it's not in their interest to meddle with the production / creation of the asset in mining, but it is absolutely in their interest to understand where those assets are afterwards so they can be taxed. We know that there are a number of ways it's possible to track bitcoin to a certain extent, at that it's happening, but LN makes that harder. So they won't apply any kind of regulation that completely restricts the transfer, because that prevents potential tax opportunities that can be reinvested. I can absolutely see why an economist would favour LN regulation / licensing.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:03:44
Doesn't it potentially break a number of money transmitter laws?
Not hating at all, I believe in bitcoin and LN has great potential, but is this not the first time a law is technically being broken by by simply running crypto software and facilitating transactions on the network, rather than just using crypto to do something illegal?

As I said, I'm all in on crypto, I run a full node. And yet if I've heard inaccurate info about the legality of of running a LN node, then so have others. So rather than fuming and pointing fingers, wouldn't it be better to respond with some info, facts, places where research is held.

What logic and why it's flawed?
Again, not hating, but I've not heard of a regulation or law in the US (or UK where I am from) that specifies it being illegal to run a node, mine or hold bitcoin. None of those are "transferring" money. Lightning is absolutely about the movement of money.
