I feel so bad now lol. I went back to my Coinbase account, and stared blankly at the fact I sold 1 BTC a few years ago for $500. Sucks, especially considering the wife and I are trying to adopt now, and if I held on to that 1 single BTC, we could afford it.  
But hey, lesson learned!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:46
Well, I only have like .004 BTC right now, and that's in the form of mostly DOGE sitting on a multipool account. I can't even exchange it for the mere $60 it's worth because most exchanges won't let you exchange small amounts like that. Oh well!  
100 though? Jeez, that sucks lol.  
Part of me wants to wait until the price goes down (if it ever does) and reinvest, but if I do that, I might as well invest in stocks. It would be more consistent at least. But, I'm not very good at the sort of thing, and not sure if the wife would be up for investing money in *anything* considering we're knee deep in double loans, between the adoption and the IVF we just paid for.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:24:18
This is amazing.  
If I had 1 BTC, I would use it to give a child a home. No joke.  
I used to own .8 BTC about 3 years ago, but at the time I sold it for about $100 profit (I think it was $500 total when I sold it), just so I can help pay rent. I wasn't even on the verge of eviction or anything, just needed a lil more cash cushion.  
Well, now I'm married and have a job and home, and we've been trying to have a child. Went through an expensive IVF treatment, only to find out she can't have children. That was about 10 grand down the drain.  
Now we are looking into adoption, which costs about 20k-30k.  
Had I held onto that .8 BTC, we would have been able to pay for most of our bills that's costing us so much, just for a *chance* at having a child. =(  
I know I know, I shouldn't beat myself up about it, but it's tough after going through so much financially and emotionally, especially considering I *could* have been as fortunate as others here who were smart and held on.  
So, if you're reading this and still have coin, hold onto it. Don't make the same mistakes some of us like me made. You never know what life will throw at you, for better or for worse.  
Edit: Rereading this, and it sounds like I'm begging. I'm not. Just sharing my own story of seller's remorse. Go on and celebrate, those of you who invested into BTC more than I did (and this is coming from someone who used to be *very* interested in BTC, but have lost said interest. I still believe in it, though, so I'm going to buy $10 worth every month and use it where I can.) Cheers!

I love Coinbase for its ease of use and 'just works' function. None of this feeling like a drug dealer meeting up with people on local bitcoins or driving 30 minutes from home to the nearest coin ATM, or worse, buying them off of eBay for a considerable markup.  
Didn't know there was any hate (but I don't frequent this sub much anymore).  


This is funny actually. If people are legit upset because their coins get traced from Coinbase to point B, because they are doing illegal stuff, then these are obvious amateurs. Not saying I do anything of that sort, but come on guys, it's 2015, you know how to use Bitcoin, chances are you know how to Google methods of staying anonymous, breaking traceable links, and staying in the shadows. It's Bitcoin FCOL, it's not that hard to break any forms of tracing. Heck, it's like every other week there's some article about how people are using Bitcoin on the deepweb and staying anonymous. Not exactly a secret anymore.

Merchants are going to use it as a payment protocol that's free of charge, which in turns saves them transaction fee costs. Even if it never becomes adopted as a more mainstream currency, the benefits of using it to send/receive money still make Bitcoin a VERY attractive option for merchants.
Remember, Bitcoin is the internet of money. Don't dismiss it as a currency, but also know the strengths it carries as a protocol.

I would say explain it to them in its most basic manner. Don't bother with things like mining and hashing, unless they inquire.
For the end user, Bitcoin will be either a currency/transfer of value, or, a payment protocol, depending on which end of it you are on (merchant vs consumer).
*We* are the future of Bitcoin, so the burden is on us (the younger generation) to see that Bitcoin is successful in the future. Thus, it's more important for us to understand the technical details than it is for the old farts.

I think we can see an average of 1500 by summertime, purely speculative based on the recent growth.
Of course, factors....
But, quite honestly, I think official news we get from the US, and if it's GOOD news for Bitcoin, will only increase value - by a lot.
Things like tax clarification and laws and regulations regarding BTC will only make it easier for businesses to approach and accept BTC. The primary thing that prevents businesses from accepting BTC payments is the uncertainty surrounding it.
I think the opposite will happen from what we saw with China if the US embraces and accepts BTC, providing clarity of how it should be handled, taxed, etc.
The businesses you see now that are accepting BTC are taking a risk, although I don't think a very large one. Fortunately it doesn't cost much money to implement BTC into your business.

But you don't have to be a STEM worker to understand metric if metric was also found/used on every day objects, like kitchen measuring utensils, tape measures, gas, etc.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that people in countries that use metric in everyday life don't have an issue using it because they are used to it. They would have a harder time knowing 12 inches = 1 foot. 
Since most of the world already uses metric, I don't see this naming convention being a real big issue. As the Bitcoin community, and because it's still in early adoption phases, it's up to us as teachers, ELI5s and entrepreneurs to help ensure Average Joe spends the correct amount. We incorporate that 'ease of use' into the design of websites, apps, etc to make it easier for the end user.
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:03:00
I don't think I quite follow.
If you are the owner of the Enjin website (like me), then of course you want to set up a Coinbase account specifically for your Enjin site. Don't use personal accounts. You wouldn't use your personal bank account for a business you own. Same thing here.
Enjin requires that you have a Coinbase account to *receive* payments from players who wish to donate using BTC.
The donators, however, do not require a Coinbase account. When they choose to donate to your Enjin site, they are taken to a checkout page. Here, they can choose to use their own Coinbase account to submit the BTC donation, or they can donate to a send-to address.
So, yes, Enjin has access to the Coinbase account you point it to via the Coinbase API by using Coinbase's merchant tools, which are there for just this type of thing.
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:32:41
I already am! =D
In regards to technology and difficulty, I guess I'm misunderstanding something here, so feel free to help me understand.
From what I know so far (yet to learn more), when difficulty increases, it causes the cost of mining ratio to payout to decrease. We are already past the point where solo mining is no longer normally affordable, and people are resorting to pools.
If pool sizes increase while difficulty also increases, then wouldn't the payout per person contributing then decrease over time, especially since the reward of 25 BTC will only be cut in half later down the road?
Or would the reward from transaction fees increase as BTC becomes more widely accepted and used, thus making up for the increase in difficulty?
TBH, the only reason I can begin to fathom difficulty surpassing cost of technology is due to the helium/computer chip shortage.
Again, I'm just speculating and perhaps also misunderstanding.

Something else I'm curious about is the subject of the S-curve.
There is speculation that BTC's price will result in an s-curve. It could, it could not. I'm leaning more towards thinking it will, but that depends on several factors as well.
For the sake of discussion, let's assume we are in the year 2200, and we are looking at a graph of BTC's price and it happens to be an s-curve.
What factors would have caused BTC to begin flattening out (the end of the exponential growth)? Would it be after the 21 millionth BTC is released, or would it be a point where difficulty of mining becomes so high, that technology at the time can't keep up? (Even more factors play into this, such as the helium/computer chip shortage.)
Again, this is just all speculation for discussion, and it's a process of learning for me. I enjoy discussion to see it from multiple points of view, especially from those who may be more experienced than I am.

This is the second time I have seen this posted here, the first having a comment from another user raging about how it's been posted many times already (so what? People need to know!)
However, this is the first time I have EVER seen ANY kind of phishing alert broken down and investigated this deep. Thank you for applying some tech knowledge behind it. I consider myself pretty tech savvy, but have never heard of a txt file being an executable. The best phishing scams are the ones that you least expect.
When someone posts a phishing alert, people kinda go 'oh, yea, better watch out'. But when someone digs into it and explains WHY and HOW it works, then people tend to remember it more. Good job.
Oh, and I want this to be a sticky until it stops happening.

@_date: 2014-01-02 01:12:34
While I do hope to make some money by investing in BTC (I'm not risking my life savings on it.), I also strongly stand by the philosophy behind it.
With the current bank system and the gradual loss of trust from the people (US primarily speaking here), BTC has become more and more attractive. (No one person or centralized system can control it.)
As you research BTC more in depth, you, too, will gain an understanding of why it may succeed in the future. If BTC does end up failing, I think that another, better cryptocurrency will take its place, because the idea behind it is extremely strong and catches the interest of many people - even major banks.
Even if you don't plan to invest in it, I think it's still worth buying some and start using it as a secondary currency, simply to spark controversy and raise awareness.

I realize that there are other factors that would affect price, like mining difficulty and popularity, but the importance of these factors and exactly what factors there are is something I'm still learning about and trying to understand.
I've seen varying 'predictions' on the value of 1 BTC in the future, with even some upwards of $1M, which seems ridiculous. I'm open minded, but I also want to seriously consider factors and facts to gather a more realistic idea of the direction BTC is going.

I like how they used bits as shorthand for mBTC. 0.00000010 = 10 bits. That's currently worth $0.00008, but if price keeps going up, by the year that's in this show, it could be worth a few bucks.

I'm still unsure how I feel about the upcoming surge of altcoins. What I'm *hoping* is that exchanges/multipools will increase their efficiency and become better to compete with newer pools that just slapped some html together and said 'now mining dogecoin!' (sorry Middlecoin. You are a decent switcher, but as a designer, I puke every time I check my shares on your site.)
I guess we have to sit back and just let the altcoins roll in and watch them. The smart ones among us will use them to our advantage. I say learn as much as you can and go for it.
What I'm still curious about is will any of these altcoins (other than litecoin) actually succeed? Still learning about various factors that could determine this. IMO DOGE won't last, but Coinye *might* just because it has a celebrity with beaucoup bucks supporting it. There certainly is a factor of popularity of names that can cause a coin to succeed for x amount of time. Not much power behind names of coins overall, but it's enough to matter in altcoins, apparently.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:18:57
That would be the ultimate solution, but I'm curious how this would happen. What if, somehow, the blockchain would refuse hashrates over a certain rate? Like a hard ceiling. 
There are many factors we need to push on to help decentralize hashpower, but for now, we just need to ensure no one breaks 51%. It's a good start, but no where an end all solution.

Invest, yes. But not simply to get rich quick. People not only need to buy into Bitcoin, but they also need to spread to news. Teach people about it. Give them some BTC to play with to learn. Start using it as payment methods where possible.
By doing this, you are helping Bitcoin grow. If everyone just bought and held, then it would go nowhere.
With that being said, I expect this year to be big for BTC. It's already caught fire. Now that fire is just spreading. Help fuel it.

I also suspect this has to do with China. How? Not sure, but we are certainly still feeling its effect. Nothing to worry about, imo.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:07:41
Right, but what I was suggesting is a forced way of distributing the hash power equally across all pools.
For example: if 10 pools exist, then each pool would always have 10% of the hash power. If an 11th node came online, then they would get an equal share of the pie.
Again, I'm not sure *how* this could be achieved, but it's a thought.

Well, I do admit I am not *the* Tim Burton (I think I mentioned that?). However, after dealing with the joking all these years, I learned to play along and lead people a little bit for fun.
If I was the actual Tim Burton, I would not be investing in BTC (or would I?) I mean, there's no actual reason to unless you're an unemployed full time college student who likes to take risks.
I have always enjoyed the quirkiness of his movies. People tend to criticize his choices, the recent attraction to Depp, and overall the weirdness of his work. To me, I say go for it. When you're in the shoes of a movie director, who cares about criticism? Movies are art. Art is supposed to be fun. There are no rules. And I appreciate that from any director.

This is actually a good analogy. I've used both those  services myself (no longer do because it was hurting my power bill).
The only difference is that the Bitcoin network benefits more from computer hardware that is built *specifically* for mining - equipment that might not be useful for other things.
Yes, you could use your GPU/CPU to mine, but then you end up in the same boat as using other collaborative non profit services, being you're dishing out more money for power than what it's worth.
Of course, there are other reasons why people might continue to mine BTC without profit, being to simply contribute to the network's hash power. I wholly encourage people to do this and learn something from it, but of course we all want to save money as well when we need to. Same applies to  services - contributing processing power benefits research, but don't do it if you can't afford it.

I'm no developer, but what if there was a way to force people to point their miners to a client that they *must* download, which then decides what pool to mine on based, keeping it evenly split? If they tried pointing their miner directly to a pool, the network would reject hashes somehow.

Derp. I was wrong, then, regarding Coinye.
I have a pretty good understanding of memes and how they work beyond what the typical internet memer knows. As in, I know that the word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene. (OMG, new coin name - memecoin/dawkincoin/genecoin) I also have a good understanding of how memes work psychologically and why they stick around/dissolve.
I know there's a DOGE community and everything else that comes with it being a meme. Pretty much, it's no different than any other cultural trend, be it languages, sports, or even religion. They are all memes/memeplexes.
Because doge was already a memeplex, it was easy to adopt a currency based off of it. Dogecoin is now part of the Doge memeplex, and should stick around until the memeplex dissolves (be it that people grow out of it or something else catches on.)

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I assumed the unknown were just solo miners who aren't pointing to anything/smaller nodes and pools.

I'm not sure about where you live or the available facilities near you, but here in Orlando, we have FermiLabs. They have metal working machines that are open for use to paying members.
That could be an option - do it yourself. These days, machines can create this sort of thing from a cad file.

Because we all take risks. Everyone here understands that very well. I took a risk with Elfman, and he ended up being a pretty awesome dude. We wouldn't have the same Jack Skellington without him, would we?
When we take a risk and it serves us well, we tend to trust it.

I'm thinking the same. Looking at the graph for '13 alone, most of that increase happened near the end of the year.
When investing, I think people should think more conservatively, and not get too hopeful. Causes irrational decisions.

I'm hopeful, but I think we will see smart entrepreneurs step up and take charge of the future of mining.

Maybe part of the reason why Satoshi kept himself/themselves hidden is that the system could have easily been knocked off track in its early stages. It had to enter our world quietly and carefully as to not catch the attention of those who would seek to destroy it when it was still fragile.
Also, even if we found out who Satoshi is in the future, it would not matter, even if he/they had some sort of dark history. I think that if Satoshi was to reveal him/themselves, they/he would do it when the time is right - when such a reveal would have no effect on Bitcoin (or simply a positive one).
Remember, the type of underground community that Bitcoin and other cryptographic techs come from are those who wish to provide a type of technology to the world or one another that more powerful entities wish to control or regulate. Imagine if Satoshi tried to present the Bitcoin protocol as a product to the FCC or similar committee. That would have been the last anyone heard of it.

If one McDs is doing it, then my next question would be: Is this just one McD doing it independently, or is this coming from corporate level, using one (possibly more, just unreported) locations to test it out before rolling it out to all locations?
The answer would make a world of difference and could determine whether a BTC price increase is upon us or not.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:46:29
That was my thinking. Bitcoin would still reference 1.0, but bits would be mBTC/satoshis/whatever.
In this case, in the future, if 10 bits = 0.00000010 BTC, then it would be more plausible and make more sense is 1 BTC = that-amount-we-all-hope-for-in-the-future.

Bitcoins used to be highly profitable for early miners, but not anymore. However, difficulty will NEVER rise so high that it will collapse the Bitcoin system. Difficulty automatically adjusts based on the number of miners on the network (correct me if I'm wrong on this, or give further clarification, you miner experts out there.)
From what I understand, if the difficulty went up so high that half the mining power shut down because they found it no longer worth it, the network difficulty would automatically adjust itself (lower) to entice miners to plug back in and start again. And... the difficulty would go up again.
The system is tending, however, towards making basement mining no longer profitable, but rather, the bigger nodes and people with next gen hardware will be the ones reeling in profits. Bitcoin will ALWAYS be profitable for those who put the most effort in.
As far as intrinsic value, watch this video (and all the other videos to learn more about Bitcoin) - 
I feel like we are dawning on a new era of mining. We are coming out of a time where people can just put together a robust dedicated rig for less than their life savings. The times of mining with your GPU/CPU are FAR gone (unless you mine altcoins). One of the biggest hurdles currently is the lack of companies that are producing mining equipment that is not only affordable, but that can deliver their products without being backrodered for 6 months.
Butterflylabs, despite their recent negative reputation (research that before buying from them), did pretty well in being the first to produce mining specific equipment.
As time passes, we should see more and more companies pop up and produce mining equipment. In fact, it would be smart if current tech giants (Samsung, Intel, nVidia, AMD, etc) got involved and started making ASICs. They already have the capability of mass producing equipment and handling large numbers of orders without being backed up for 6 months.
To me, if Bitcoin keeps catching on and keeps growing, mining will only get easier, not harder, but not so easy that anyone can do it and get rich. It's going to favor those who dedicate a business around it.

Other tech industries (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc) experienced the same volatility in their earlier years. Thing is, people don't know it because that information isn't typically released to the public (because people typically don't care). Any early investor in these markets know, and probably aren't one bit surprised that Bitcoin is just as volatile.
What makes Bitcoin different from other tech companies that experienced high volatility early on is that Bitcoin was never privatized for x amount of time, and has been public since time 0. It's rare this happens, and the masses, who the majority of don't know about the past volatility of tech giants today, are reacting in an irrational way simply because they lack the knowledge of comparison/experience.
So, yes, calling Bitcoin unreasonably volatile after just 5 years, having been public ALL 5 years, is irrational. But I don't blame people. It's unfamiliar to them.

The recent price drop happened after Mt. Gox went offline for a few hours, which happened after some whale movement. I'm going to ride this downfall, but I expect it to go up and past $1000 before the end of the month (unless Jan 31st has some effect on this)

Much agreed! Very tacky for anyone to beg. I have always had a much similar mindset to this if I were to ever win the lottery, or something similar like this.
Going public, to me, about my winning/lucky findings or whatever it may be is the last thing I would do.
Get it secured first, get your ducks in a row, think long and hard about what you want to do with it, and don't blow it! You always hear about those lottery winners who go broke because they didn't have a (good) plan.
Oh, and happy new year! What a way to bring it in.

Don't overlook the fact that ASIC technology is a fairly new thing. It's only going to get better to keep up with the difficulty (and in turn increase it).

If we don't get any word from the federal level regarding banks and marijuana sometime soon, then we will see USD come into the bitcoin market as fast as dispensaries accept bitcoin. 
I encourage everyone who works/lives close to these to inform dispensaries of this option, especially with doing it via Coinbase to convert the coins back into fiat instantly. It's a very nice work around.

Of course, and I can understand why it may annoy some - they tap F5 and expect some new exciting news, but instead see this. I have desensitized myself to reposts, and approach them in one of two ways:
1) Treat old news as no news and ignore it.
2) Assume the person posting it just learned of it, meaning it's new info to them, and give my two cents on it to help them understand it better or what be it. That's part of contributing to a community - even if it's old news to you, you can help stir up new insights and stances on old subjects.

I think it will do Bitcoin more good than harm. Eventually, exhanges might just stop accepting all but a few altcoins.

The screenshot is a Minecraft website host that probably does it similar to Enjin. I'm sure merchants have different ways of accepting payments, including just the most basic 'here's my payment address, donate/pay to it!'
What a hot wallet service provides, though, are callback URLs and an API that can help automate things like "your payment failed, please try again!" or confirmations.
As always, take precautions and keep your BTCs safe. Even though our website has a dedicated Coinbase account for accepting BTC payments, I will still be taking precautions to export larger amounts to keep them secure and safe. After all, I don't plan to spend any of the BTC received from donations on behalf of the website. Chances are I'll hold them safely until a) we do end up needing to spend BTC on behalf of the website (not very likely in the near future) or b) prices rise high enough where I can cash out and dump the fiat back into our Minecraft server. 
Either way, the way I see it is that by accepting BTC, I'm at least helping it grow, even if I don't use it anytime soon.
Oh, and Enjin is just a website host for games. You can host a site for your game clans or servers for a fairly decent price. We pay $9 a month, and that includes a Teamspeak 10 slot server. It's a great option for Minecraft servers.

Probably because you assume all Bitcoiners are Libertarian and are all about "yea! down with fiat and up with freely used currency! cant wait for a world where everyone uses bitcoin cuz it's superior in EVERY way imaginable. Woooo! PEACE TO ALL!"  
THAT is probably the most despicable attitude because it's so detached from reality and causes people to be blind to the realistic approaches the Bitcoin community should be taking.  
Everyone thinks they can just take over the world over night with Bitcoin, when in no way that will happen.  
What we need to actually focus on is using Bitcoin, for now, what it's currently strongest at doing, which is moving Fiat digitally over the web securely, quickly, and most importantly, cheaply.  
I stopped browsing this sub cuz all the realistic posts about how Bitcoin is helping small businesses avoid expensive CC transaction fees get drowned out by all the "IMA BE RICH!" and "Bitcoin is gonna replace SO and SO country's Fiat! Today Greece, tomorrow the whole world!" posts.  
It's delusional, and it's hurting Bitcoin's potential.  
People need to accept that Bitcoin isn't gonna replace Fiat in our lifetime, and focus on applying Bitcoin where it actually works. Stop hoarding it, stop using it to call yourself an investor, and start using it to help fix some of the problems fiat currently causes like transaction fees and security.

I might be way off about this... but wasn't the last crash, back when it was $1000 per BTC, caused by the whole Mt Gox ordeal? Without it, prices would have never climbed that high, right?  
People like to say "history repeats itself", but that's nothing more than confirmation bias to convince yourself that your coins are gonna make you rich. You can't predict the future price. All you can do is learn from the past, predict circumstances that might affect the price, and ultimately, understand factors that will 'cap' the price. So, tell me, what would cause BTC to go for $10k+ each? What even caused it to hit $1000?

Hate to be the devil's advocate, but I saw both this altered version and the actual PayPal version, and, uh, it's not a spoof. This is pretty much the same thing as what Saul Goodman did with Howard Hamlin's billboard. Pretty much a copy paste, but changed the name and the portrait. Yea, it's too similar to the original.  
Sorry, but I'm on PayPal's side with this one.  
Although, if you were just sharing the video, and weren't the original creator, then it's wrong for FB to have went that far. They should have just removed the video. Unless, of course, you uploaded it somewhere just to post it.

Even if it did, people wouldn't find it all that useful, since the end goal here is to transfer a fiat currency from you to the business.  
Like, if I bought something for $50 with BTC, but it was on sale for $45, kept the receipt, and then needed to return it two months later due to a defect under warranty, then having the amount I originally paid would be the useful bit here.  
The exchange rate of BTC to fiat could drastically change in the course of 2 months, so I would want to ensure I get refunded an equal amount of BTC to match my dollar amount, not the BTC amount.  
In cases like this, BTC isn't the currency. It's a method of moving money from you to the business through digital means. On both ends, there's a fiat amount, and BTC is the middle man.

YES I know it's not actually one, but when the whole damn community just talks about price ups and downs and how they might get rich one day instead of, ya know, the fact that it's a free to use instant and secure payment method, it makes you wonder why those who merely heard about BTC in passing or through the news disregard it as a scheme.
