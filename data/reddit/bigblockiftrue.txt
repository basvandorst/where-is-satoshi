You are confusing speed of light and capacity of light. The latter is unlimited, just send more photons.

Bitcoin has no monopoly as a digital currency. If you try to push Bitcoin users with fees, they will switch to Bitcoin Cash or altcoins.

It is merely a refinement to the difficulty adjustment process. There is no perfect way to do difficulty adjustments, since you can never algorithmically forecast how future hashpower will depend on the new difficulty.
So far Bitcoin still has a higher block height than Bitcoin Cash, meaning Bitcoin Cash has lower average inflation than Bitcoin since the fork. Bitcoin Cash will probably briefly overtake Bitcoin's block height (not to be confused with accumulated difficulty) after which Bitcoin Cash difficulty will go 4x and Bitcoin will take the inflation lead again.
Without EDA Bitcoin Cash block times so far would have remained extremely high and inflation would have been way too low.

Both forks having "Bitcoin" in their names avoids giving one of the two a brand advantage. The competition can therefore focus on technological merits, e.g. confirming coffee payments as fast as possible.

Speed of light is not a limiting factor in the blocksize debate. Bandwidth is, but that's an entirely different concept.
The distinction is between when a node is notified of a new block being found and when it has finished downloading the block. The first notification is independent of the blocksize, close to the physical distance with the miner divided by the speed of light. The subsequent download time does depend on blocksize; it is equal to the blocksize divided by the bandwidth of the connection.
Speed of light cannot be increased but bandwidth can.

Bitcoin's 21 million limit never included altcoins. Even if you wouldn't  have to compete with forks, you'd still have to compete with altcoins that print their own digital money.

Having money is about having the option to send it.

Over 40% of mining power defected Bitcoin according to [fork.lol]( As a result, the Bitcoin mempool accumulated [many transactions with high fees](


Bitcoin Cash has two advantages over Bitcoin in this respect:
* Bitcoin Cash does not operate at capacity. When fewer blocks are found, it can keep processing transactions in larger blocks.
* Emergency Difficulty Adjustment kicks in if the Bitcoin Cash difficulty gets too high.

You can expect it there soon after August 1st when it starts as an actual cryptocurrency. Miners have promised mining it and wallets are already available. The $8 billion is directly calculated from the value of Bitcoin Cash in the [ViaBTC futures market]( Let me know how all of that compares to your AirCoin.

Hence the urgent need for a high-capacity Bitcoin with much lower transaction fees. It would be unwise to place all our bets on the Lightning Network which is still very unproven technology.

Bitcoin Cash is already the third cryptocurrency in the world with an [$8 billion market cap]( before the fork even happened. Wouldn't call that "just another shitcoin".

[Bitcoin Cash]( a fork of Bitcoin activating August 1st with faster, on-chain scaling and without SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:43:42
No. They've nothing to do with each other apart from unluckily ending up with the same abbreviation.

[Withdraw your bitcoins from Coinbase before the fork]( if you want to get access to your Bitcoin Cash. Also see the [Bitcoin Cash website]( for basic information.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:01:03
Such a split is going to happen regardless: [Bitcoin Cash]( will fork on August 1st for people who want faster and on-chain scaling instead of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:17:49
Official website for Bitcoin Cash is [here]( including links to Bitcoin Cash wallets (including an adaptation of Electrum). After the fork, simply use a Bitcoin Cash wallet for Bitcoin Cash transactions and a Bitcoin wallet for Bitcoin transactions; there will be [two-way replay protection](
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:30:28
Simply install a Bitcoin Cash wallet and import your Bitcoin private keys. After the fork on August 1st you can transact Bitcoin Cash separately from your Bitcoin with it. Check [the Bitcoin Cash website]( for basic information.
