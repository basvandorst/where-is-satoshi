Well you seem to have answered your own question and than asked another about btc’s potential. No it means btc’s potential is much much much higher. There is no ceiling and nothing stopping it. We are looking at trillions of dollars of worth here. We aren’t even at a quarter trillion yet. I’m all in on crypto its going to change the world. Its already started but this is just the beginning.
