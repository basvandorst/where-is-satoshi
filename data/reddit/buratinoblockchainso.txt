And So?
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:33:06
Yes, its not Trezor it is Trezor Mini
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:41:09
This is purely our decision to call the device. We have not done anything new, except to improve the device which is currently far away from the ideal and security. But we did everything to make this device. We use the Trezor platform, firmware, bootloader. Therefore, this Trezor is simply smaller, better, safer, cheaper.
Your device is completely on our platform now in the alpha version, so wait for the soon announcement, about a device that will turn the world of cold storage over. And send Trezor and Ledger and all other manufacturers for a well-deserved rest. So far, we are showing what we can do. Namely, to take one of the industry leaders and improve its device to the ideal state.

 Is Trezor Mini a registered brand? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:34:14
Yes, the entire board is flooded with a special tool that eliminates the possibility of reading information from the chip legs
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:16:15


 Forbidden by whom? 
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:27:16
   
We did this for a long time do not worry. Trezor is not a registered trademark, this word cannot be registered. And besides, we are everywhere, including on the packaging, indicating that we are a separate company Buratino Blockchain Solutions 
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:30:40
 Yes you are right) 
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:28:36






 We have the same circuitry, the same components. But placed differently and improved. Official Trezor firmware in any other case, if we tried to change, we would not be allowed into the system. All of these are open source and we have not violated any law using them. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:30:26


   
Want to come to visit? Welcome, we will show and tell everything about our device and you will understand that it is the best on the market. And buy yourself more than one thing. Believe us. All contacts and addresses are on our website. Looking forward to seeing you 
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:03:28
And where did the Chinese full Trezor counterparts come from? With the original bootloader? and firmware? With identical circuitry. Did you give them to them? What for?
Yes, and the build quality and soldering on the circuit is very similar to the Chinese, it can check any user having disassembled the wallet. Or do you have a very old production and do you solder by hand? Although our engineers even do manual soldering than you do in a supposedly factory.
Soon our device will go on sale, buy it or send me the address, I will send you a gift. Disassemble it and see what quality means! And how it should be!
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:21:12
   
The company Trezor located in the Czech Republic, you are right, but the factories and the assembly of your devices in China. According to your words, we have accomplished the impossible because we have already made a hardware wallet better than Trezor

  [Trezor Mini]( hardware wallet. It is based on an open license Creative Commons 4.0.  
So yes)
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:01:32










   
The word Trezor cannot be registered. Trezor has registered the trademarks Trezor Wallet, Trezor One, Trezor T. Accordingly, all other phrases that are possible we can use. And there is no law forbidding it. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:53:42
Trezor cannot be registered this common word. They registered a picture of the lock and Trezor. But not the word Trezor
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:56:24
What exactly?
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:16:24
And So?
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:13:56
Are we stealing the Trezor brand? How?
We use the original open source software, the Trezor website and all of its features. This is a complete analogue of Trezor. But better. We improved it, reduced it and made it safer by eliminating the possibility of hacking if the attacker has physical access to the device. And people buying our wallet will use the Trezor platform, so we are increasing the number of platform users and strengthening our position in the hardware storage market. Therefore, once again I want to ask in what place are we a parasite company?
We declare ourselves openly and do not hide from anyone. You better ask yourself how many gray devices are on the market under the full name Trezor. And how many troubles they bring to people. How many devices go into the shadows from the official factory Trezor in China.
If we made a device that is better than what is on the market. Why don't we do this? We can send a sample to any expert for evaluation and he will confirm that this is a complete Trezor analog, but better!

Read other posts in this topic I'm tired of responding to the same
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:12:58
Scam in what? are we asking for money? do we conduct ICO? Do we release tokens? Not
We are manufacturers of equipment, Trezor has an open license and anyone can use it. We took their wallet and improved it BUT we did not touch the software. Using the Trezor Mini, the user also enters the trezor.io website and performs all actions on their platform.
And so once again ask what is the scam?
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:09:39










    
We do not disguise ourselves. We immediately declare and write it everywhere that we work on the Trezor platform and to work with the wallet you need to go to the Trezor website. So what are the problems? We made the device better, smaller, cheaper. But the full analogue of Trezor and it works on the trezor platform. They just called it Trezor Mini because it is smaller. It is not prohibited 
 
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:55:24
It is better)
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:54:53
Apparently not the answers you read
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:51:05
Seriously? in the same package? with exact dimensions? with the original bootloader? You cannot recognize them in your system, which means it is the original Trezor assembled at the same factory as yours. Just for you, the Chinese do it during the day, and at night they stamp it for themselves on the black market. I am willing to argue for anything to buy your Trezor and from the gray market and give it for examination to establish that they are going to the same factory.
And you have not answered my question since you work at Satochi Labs. How could you make such a device? Why not make a safe device?Why do you say that Russians should take and redo the device for you? improve it, make it more secure? Thereby protecting your users from hacking the wallet and losing their funds. Why couldn't you do it yourself? Why do you spit on your users?

Ok, many people  tried to blame us for being a scam.
Let's remind everyone what a scam is, and also answer a number of constant questions so that we will not return to this again:
Scam is a fraudulent scheme performed by a dishonest individual, a group, or a company in attemption to obtain money or some other value. It is the 1st thesis. The 2d is a defamation (the term defamation is broken down into libel and slander).
**If you insist on the fact  that we are scam** \- kindly justify your argument: firstly, legal norms, including EU law and generally accepted norms and principles of international law; secondly, as factual circumstances, otherwise we will consider such arguments to be a slander with all the ensuing legal consequences, since everyone here is fighting for them like that.
**In this thread, we listened a lot about allegedly misleading consumers by associating ourselves with Trezor.** But let's look at each item.To begin with, we respectfully relate to the activities of Satoshi Labs, but at the same time Satoshi is a personal brand of the Bitcoin’s creator and everything that is done on it is done with the same bases on which our activity is based. It’s the first point.
The second one: we were given a link to the registered trademark “Trezor”: here it is - [ But let's look at the points here too. Filing Date - 2018-06-18 &amp; Status Date - 2018-11-29 The trademark itself belongs to SatoshiLabs s.r.o [
**But now - important details:** first, we are talking only about the image The mark consists of a lock followed by the wording  “TREZOR”. The word “trezor” from Czech means “safe”: in the Translation of Words in Mark punkt, this is what is written: The English translation of "TREZOR" in the mark is "SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX" generally usable and may not be subject to this or any other trademark. Secondly, according to the [ data on the link [ the following should be indicated: “... information about the trademark Trezor security, see the Security section ”. But where exactly is this information?
**We want to say that Satoshi Labs initially misled consumers**, instilling in them the confidence that the Trezor brand might belong to anyone. Here are some examples: [ Section 28 states: “To comply with our Company's and Associated Partners' trademark, copyrighting and other intellectual property criteria and requirements”, - but at the same time the registration of a trademark, as we see above, was only in 2018, and the agreement was written in 2017 (and earlier - according to the archives of the Internet). Moreover, in another agreement - in the “COPYRIGHT” section it is said: “You acknowledge that the Site contains information, data, software, photographs, graphs, videos, typefaces, graphics, music, sounds, and other material (collectively "Content") that are protected by copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, rights in databases and/or other proprietary rights, and that these rights are valid and protected in all forms, media and technologies existing now or hereinafter developed’’ But again - it is dated October 23, 2017, that is, almost a year before the application.
**On what grounds did Satoshi Labs make such statements?** We think the answer is obvious: on the basis of their own will and despite any registered rights, since they simply did not exist.
**But this is not all:** in these agreements (for example, p. 25 [ it is stated: “Not to own a domain which includes the trademark of our Company or our Associated Partners. Domains containing the logo of "TREZOR" are strictly prohibited””, which is a direct restriction on the legal capacity of participants and violates the EU, US law and the principles of public international law. Moreover, is Satoshi Lab (hereinafter referred to as SL) a trezor.io domain holder? No - [ A reasonable question arises: on what basis does SL limit the capacity of other industry participants? And also - on what basis does SL limit the right to use Trezor even together with the graphic image of the lock, if the registration mark is issued only for the Czech Republic (the application states: Country - In Czech Republic; Foreign Priority Claim IN - False)? Our target buyers are in other regions.
**Let's talk straight:** SL, selling tens and tens of thousands of devices since 2012, can’t register a trademark in the US / EU for 6 years? If this is such an important question for SL, then where is the legal basis for its correct solution? There are not.
Further, they are trying to prove us that SL is fighting for its name, protecting the market from projects like ours. But then the question is - why there are dozens of websites selling Trezor products on the Web, with no agreement on official distribution, or are they hiding them pretty well? Here's an example,  not to look for a long time, [ This is also evidence that SL never thought to protect the word “Trezor” as a trademark. And it is impossible.
**And now - the most important thing:** how exactly was the company notified of the receipt of the Tresor SL trademark in the Czech Republic? Where is the official statement and related press releases? You can say, it is not significant? No, this is of paramount importance for us and the entire community, because the Buratino service has existed for more than a year, and the registration took place only at the end of the current one. In addition, treatment through the feedback form - does not give any result: we confirmed this in the process of correspondence.
Thus, we have explicit legal connivance from the site of SL and angry, but not justified by any legal arguments statements made here on Reddit.
Yes, knowing (only now!), that SL has a trademark, albeit not for international, but only for regional protection, we, taking into account the old merits of SL, will change the logo, but we think that the word “Trezor” is a bust: Let us then prohibit the usage of  words “Bitcoin” or “Freedom”?
**We hope that our position has become clear and will not continue to be discussed unfoundedly.**

 Our wallet works on the Trezor platform. In fact, this is the Trezor, just smaller in size, waterproof, and cheaper. But in order to use it, you need to go to the trezor.io website and perform all the actions there. We have not done anything illegal and are acting under an open license Creative Commons 4.0
