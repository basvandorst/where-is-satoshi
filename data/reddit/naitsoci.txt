As a crypto investor
This video gave me anxiety

It wasn’t the daytrading that got him
It was greed killed the day trader

Wtf r u doing
Just buy 3500$ of bitcoin TODAY with your money
Then HODL all until his birthday 
Cash him out 3500 regardless (bitcoin ain’t going to 6,000$)

Did you ever figure out what this was? I am now having the same issue with them
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:38:05
No that's really not how it works at all
Bitcoin is not a stock it's a currency
If Wall Street figures their shit out we could buy stocks WITH bitcoin. Just like we can buy stocks with USD, EUR, etc.
Stocks aren't like bitcoin except for some being crazy volatile and jumping 200% (or dropping 99%) in value in a day. You can't spend stocks to buy anything either

I was reading a moment ago that Segwit will mean zero transaction fees and instant small transactions. Is that part of the lie?
Bcuz that would make me sad �� 
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:25:10
That was my point. Not saying I've done or I do this (I've never even used crypto) but there is no tool that can "crack" encryption and in the way of TOR there are only ways to circumvent it part of the time (hacked TOR nodes). 
Anybody can use a tumbler
Anybody can use TOR
The "tool" is just gathering of unencrypted info, ie, the people who really most likely ARENT trying to get out of taxes and who ARENT trying to launder. The people who choose not to encrypt all of their information
This article being pushed around is just a friendly reminder to everybody who just recently adopted bitcoin. That's pretty much it.
That being said pretty much all exchanges require all of your personal information
Long story short. If you profit in crypto in the US. Prepare to pay taxes

Sell now. Buy dip
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:44:37
Welllllll... by deduction anything smaller than a penny being sent is spam. You know damn well nobody is eagerly sending an unspendable piece of a penny for any real reason.
And PROOF of address? Yeah DDOS attacks aren't real.. prove to me who did it! See? It never happened.
You know it's a human. Or a robot made by a human with the intention to spam. That should be good enough for something anonymous like bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:51:46
Yeah they've had it since the 1900s it's called "hey this guy is living like a millionaire and owns property... yet he only claimed 20,000 a year!"
Not hard to see that your assets &gt; life income
It's also called "ask the exchanges who the addresses belong to and cross check bitcoins worth vs cash out to their claimed income"
Again it's not rocket science and it's not magic
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:17:43
Ah yes the fat cat gives its cash to the hog. I see what they did there
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:29:42
Yeah.. a proper response to "it's worth 4 million" would be.. "really? Why?"
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:17:49
ME TOO
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:04:08
I thought the IRS was switching their classification from property to currency, firstly.
Next, if you are switching from one currency to another or even one property to another why would you have to pay on that when you haven’t realized those gains yet in spendable dollars? 
And of course you can beat that... up 38x from holding means you bought in when bitcoin was what $100?
If you would have diversified or sold on the big declines only to buy again you’d be 100-1000x 
I’m not saying it’s entirely predictable and everyone should go all in but it doesn’t hurt to trade your profits here and there so that the amount of coins you hold goes up
To each their own I guess but the “HODL 4EVA” thing isn’t for me. I’d rather trade. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:25:03
You’re comparing active strategic trading to buying and holding. 
You had to have bought early 2015
I’ve been trading all of 1 month, let me get back to you in 2.5 years 
Ps: I also exited out of the sharp decline and missed the full force of it and profited by going back and forth into BCH. I didn’t time it as well as my friend but I made money on a correction.
So you went from what 50x to 38x while I gained 10%? Lol
Like I said you can’t really compare 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:36:06
That’s one thing I’ll never understand.
Everyone wants to literally do nothing 
My friend switched to bch at 850 and switched back once bch hit 2000
How about them hodls 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:22:32
I don’t use it but shit.. 10% on 15k per week? Lol that’d make me start 
If he sends me his tax info and ID and it matches the bank then the IRS would only want that from me right?
Clearly I’d be taking necessary precautions 
That’s typical for any sort of money movement
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:57:24
$10,000 for 1 cent sent!
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:20:30
Even if I document that i’m buying using his bank account then immediately transferring to him?
I remember there being a law against this.. something about buying on behalf of someone requires a license? Maybe that has changed 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:34:22
1. I just have an account I haven’t used it in a long time. Years.
2. on a local meet up bitcoin group he had posted a message for anyone looking to make a little money
3. Of course, that’s why I just want to make sure I’m fully compliant on my end, then I don’t have to care what he does and if the IRS asks, I give them his info 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:25:16
Hmm.. so no US laws on me buying crypto on behalf of another for a fee?
As long as I get all of his personal info and ID and tax ID then I should be good. He’s taking all the risk then right?
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:34:43
Yeah but I don’t know this guy lol. That’s what’s weird 
If it was family then ok
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:05:24
Not to mention that it could be wiped out by the other half of the hashing power just by chance
And once it’s gone it’s gone
Poof goes the $
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:21:35
I see.. but my bank accounts are listed on here too.. if I buy and remove that account and the account is in another persons name that should circumvent those attacks
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:32:53
can somebody please put cash in our beloved roller coaster guys hands when he's going downhill? And then pan out to see mountains of bitcoins on the ground?
And then bit coins in his hand when it's going up
Would be... amazing..

Can you short bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:21:08
It's almost as if... they're manipulating the "media hype train" to boost the currency for a profitable exit and then hop back in once it dips again.
I hope they sell out and it just goes even higher. And they buy back in and it drops.
I'm bitter because they do this with hundreds of stocks constantly and essentially rob the uneducated/uninformed
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:34:54
By proper regulation do you mean that it's licensed properly and not in danger of suddenly being shut down and seized?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:00:44
What about electrum?
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:30:51
I like that you're well hearsed on this topic. What do you think of BitTrex if anything at all?

Losing everything meaning all of his bitcoin. -should have clarified 
All it takes is one of his lackeys to say
"hey.. I control 1200 of his bitcoin.. would be a shame if it---aaaand it's gone"
PS he was supposedly near-broke so no I don't believe he can hold wealth together. He needs dat Connor money
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:44:16
Bitcoin has negative inflation DAWG!
Less bitcoin buys tomorrow what more bitcoin buys today
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:28:37
What's spv ��
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:16:06
4% of what?
Also that "inflation" doesn't reduce coins value like inflation of currency. It goes up or stays the same even though there are more coins in circulation
So negative sorta :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:25:25
While I agree that it's ridiculous, the number is off.
1. Proving a net worth doesn't require spending of money so he'd just have to have 100k$ available at all times.
2. If the surety bond is for 25,000$ he may pay like 1000$ a year. Probably less. 
Source: I needed a 250,000$ bond and it cost me 3600$ for the entire year
3. Licensing fee is the actual expense.
Overall it's not so bad. As long as people plan ahead they won't get drowned in expenses.
Rule of thumb when starting a business: expect to lose money for 3 years!! If you don't plan for that and have money ready to spend you may go broke during licensing and lose it all.
Source: I did this with a car dealership license.

I have a friend who is doing 250,000$ in an exchange daytrading currencies. I've warned him that exchanges can run the fuck away and poof. What should he do instead?
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:46:50
Yeah but money is an easy concept. Especially when you have enough money to pay people to make money for you.
Bitcoin might just be out of reach in complexity though esp if he has someone else managing it and I wouldn't be shocked if he got "hacked" and loses everything :P
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:34:37
Don't worry everyone you won't lose everything I'll buy all of your bit coins at 1$ apiece!!
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:04:04
Yeah but I’m telling you the timing, not “we are fine” - the fed really doesn’t want trump to win 2020 so they’re going to make as natural looking of a recession as they can, check their interest rates for Bush Obama and trump you’ll see what I mean
By the end of 2020, if something doesn’t change, it will be a dangerous economy, nobody will be able to get loans reasonably.
Then if trump wins 2020, I feel the fed will knock the rates so high we will see something similar or worse than the previous housing crash
So essentially, this next 2-6 years will likely be the first real test run of crypto VS the dollar in a shaky economy. It MAY not but if the fed continues on a rate spree as they have been, its looking like it will be

This kill me I'm ded
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:43:13
That's all though ?
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:55:23
No. It would be in 2019-2020
This is a simple market correction and separately strategy play
We are fine
GDP is still 3.6%
The growth is really there but the market was overvalued anyway
If the fed raises rates further in 2019, it will begin
If the fed raises rates even more in 2020, hold onto your tendies
