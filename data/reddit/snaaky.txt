That's a reference to the collective money supply. As an aggregate, there is not enough money in the world to pay back all the loans. That's because the money for loans is created out of thin air. If everybody paid back their loans, there would be no money. This is why they cannot increase interest rates. If they did, loans would stop flowing and the world monetary systems would collapse much like a ponzi scheme that stops getting investments.

Buy a small amount to start. Not half your savings. Use that to learn how to securely store and spend it. While you do that, learn about how bitcoin works and the reasons it has real value.

Not at all. Not having money simply makes commerce very difficult. True money is about communicating and exchanging value. This makes specialization and division of labor possible. division of labor means that you can do the one thing that you are really good at and exchange that value for the rest of the things that you don't have time to do yourself. This means that people can spend a greater amount of time doing things other than meeting their own basic survival needs. Not having money, or something functionally equivalent, sends us back to the stone age.

bitcoin has all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of egold. The biggest problem with egold is that it was backed by something tangible. The good squad had something they good seize.

Big mistake using Paypal like that. I'm sorry you lost your money. When selling bitcoin, you have a irreversible transaction.

Tell that to everybody who used ebay in the early days. Nobody paid tax on anything. Everybody would write low values on shipping papers to avoid duty. How about the person who pays his mechanic in cash or barter. The illegal immigrant who does housework for cash. Nobody thinks twice about these things because they get away with it, and they are getting better value. The vast majority of people won't break natural law, but could care less about the criminals who wear silly hats and think they can create law by the stroke of a pen. Tax avoidance is the killer app for cash, and bitcoin brings that killer app to the internet and international transactions. People like to sugar coat it for the politicians and regulators, but this is where the real value of bitcoin is.

it is pseudonymous. Keep in mind that all transaction are public on the block chain and everybody can see them. As long as your ID cannot be linked to your bitcoin address, or any transaction made with that address you ARE anonymous. So, if you go to local bitcoins and pay cash for bitcoin from someone you don't know and doesn't know you, and you use that bitcoin for a single transaction, say purchasing a VPN service, BAM, you're anonymous. There is no way to link that transaction to you. You can also try and make bitcoin you already own that is linked to your ID by running it through a mixer where it gets scrambled up with other people's coins and spit out at a different address. It's how you use bitcoin that can make it anonymous, it doesn't just happen by default, and there are some very useful reasons why this is the case. Certain factions in the bitcoin space are spreading misinformation because they want to integrate and be regulated by the banks and government. This is a shortcut to making big bags of money. True international anonymous money scares states and banks because it is revolutionary and disruptive. The bitcoin ATM you visited has to comply with KYC regulations which requires you to give up your ID. If the machine is how you want to acquire bitcoin, you need to do more research into mixing to reclaim your anonymity.

My understanding that if BCH becomes more profitable early in the 2016 block difficulty period, the block time for BTC goes up as miners move to mine BTC. This causes panic and people start selling causing the price to drop. Because BTC transaction time is slowing down as miners move over to BCH, the profitability is decreased even further incentivizing even more miners to move to BCH. This death spiral continues until No more blocks are mined and the difficulty adjustment is never reached. 
The update to BCH prevents this from happening to BCH. Because BCH mining difficulty will adjust higher as miners move over, this reduces the likely hood of a BTC death spiral, but does not guarantee it. If the profitability of bitcoin decreases at a rate faster than the BCH difficulty adjustment, chain death is still possible. It seems to me that bitcoin needs to make the same/similar upgrade to guarantee chain continuance. 
I am no where close to being an expert, but this is the understanding I've come to jumping down this rabbit hole. We just watched this almost happen over the weekend and it would be foolish to write it off without considering the consequences carefully.

You really like putting words in my mouth don't you. What I said is: "Without the state corporations would not exist. Corporations are a fictional entity created by the state to grant monopolies and limited liability for the actions of the people in charge of said fictional entities."
The limited liability and enforced monopolies is what allows corporations to get away with the "woes they brought us." So if you are finished putting words in my mouth and setting up straw men, you would do well to re-examine your premise that all good things come through a monopoly on force known as state government. 
Corporations are already doing all the bad things that you say will happen if the government goes away. They are doing these things and getting away with it because the government LETS THEM!!! Corporations exist at the behest of government. Any government can dissolve any corporation within their borders. At that point the shareholders and CEOs are personally liable for their actions. No state, no corporations. It is as simple as that.
I'm not going to get into the whole back and forth trying how to explain how everything would work in a stateless society. I don't claim to know and I don't insist that it will be some sort utopia. What I do know is that I want to live in a society where people transact voluntarily according to their own best interest. This does not preclude some form of government, however it does rule out the state and taxation.

I think that PayPal will eventually convert to a sort of escrow service using bitcoin. They can be a neutral middleman that can hold on to the money until the buyer receives the goods. Due to bitcoin's irreversible nature, there is going to be a large market for escrow services. The name recognition and reputation that PayPal has will give them a leg up on the competition.

Regardless of what taxes are used for, they are taken through an involuntary, coercive process. If one makes the assumption that an individual owns the fruits of their labors, taxes are theft. If you cannot make that assumption, then taxes are slavery. Those are the only two logical conclusions. Perhaps you're a contented slave/victim and want to keep it that way. You don't need bit-coins.
Ownership of Bit-coins, at the most basic level, is really an act of rebellion or self defense. It protects your value from theft or separates you from a system of slavery. This is why bitcoin is attractive to people who love liberty, independence and voluntary transaction. 
Government is still possible with a bitcoin currency. It will just be harder for it to grow beyond its bounds and have a much smaller capacity for evil.

It is a big mistake to compare bitcoin to gold regardless of the value. Gold has value because of its intrinsic desirability. Bitcoin has value because it is useful for transacting quickly over short or long distances. Gold has a relatively stable and reliable value. Bitcoin has value only so long as it is more useful and more accepted than something else. Gold is a store of wealth. Bitcoin a currency. There is an opportunity to profit by investing in the early days of bitcoin, but the risk is always high. Let's be careful when comparing apples and oranges.

If both critters are the property of people then it is a case of property rights, and the blame can be placed on one of the owners.

Nice straw man. In any case, smoking has its benefits. Short term pleasure and excuses to take more breaks are two of them. It's not perfect, and neither is paypal. However, both fill a demand in the economy, and as long as they continue to do that, they will exist.

Sure, if it were a ferocious feline fighting with a critter that I or someone else cares about, and it was caught on video being comically flung down a staircase. Yes, yes, I would laugh.
If it was a cat being abused for the sake of someones sick sense of entertainment, no I wouldn't. It's all about context.

A currency that cannot be controlled or inflated by states or banks is of huge value. This is self evident in the rise of the value of bitcoin. People see the value in the ease of trading and state resistant nature of bitcoin. 
Current institutions are now obsolete and they will no doubt act sooner or later. It will be an expensive war that will make the war on drugs look like nothing. It will also be a loosing war for the establishment.
There is nothing wrong with gold, but I'd rather trust my value to the mathematical security of encryption than a physical element that can be confiscated at the stroke of a pen. 
Welcome to the new world

I have a couple coins that I mined, that I'm holding long term, but I purchased $100 worth of bitcoin when it was in the 200s specifically for "gambling" with.  I'm pretty happy with my sale of .5btc at $900 and buy back at around $700. I now happily have .6btc in my gambling acct. I'll probably loose it next time around, but for me, this was a good crash!

It is a big mistake to compare bitcoin to gold regardless of the value. Gold has value because of its intrinsic desirability. Bitcoin has value because it is useful for transacting quickly over short or long distances. Gold has a relatively stable and reliable value. Bitcoin has value only so long as it is more useful and more accepted than something else. Gold is a store of wealth. Bitcoin a currency. There is an opportunity to profit by investing in the early days of bitcoin, but the risk is always high. Let's be careful when comparing apples and oranges.

The only value anything has is the value someone will pay for it. Those reasons can be different from person to person. My point is, the things that make gold valuable to people is different than the things that make bitcoin valuable to people. There can be some overlap.

Yes, and your credit and debit cards won't work either. The bank, if it remains open, keeps all your records on their computers. At that point, food is money.

Indeed. The only way a cryptocurrency could be fiat is if it was mined (created) and issued by a government. Aparently the Canadian government is working on this. ( It really wouldn't be any different from paper currency as it could be inflated at will by the government. Bitcoin, by any definition of fiat, is not fiat.

Yes, any functional currency can be used to purchase a product. 
edit: A superior currency would be expected to be able to buy more kinds of products from a greater number of suppliers than an inferior currency.

I think politicians like the idea of anonymous campaign donations. I'm OK with that because crypto currency is going to cut the financial legs out from under government.

It can be used to facilitate anonymous campaign donations. That's all the short sighted, economics illiterate politicians see.

They put up a QR code and the money flows in. Bitcoin can be mixed to hide the source. I guess they could destroy or donate those funds, but I suspect that one way or another politicians will find a way to make bitcoin work for their election campaigns.

Your begging the question. Just because the state currently supplies many things does not mean that these things would not be supplied in some way in the absence of the state. I would assert that much greater wealth and quality of living is possible in the absence of a coercive state. Unfortunately, persons like yourself who are more than willing to use force on the rest of us, prevents us from even trying an alternative.

Scanning a bar-code is not hard. While it is still early days for bitcoin, there are many smart people working on ways to make bitcoin payments accessible to everybody. 
For example, it is possible to use tamper proof offline wallets as a form of physical cash currency. To use the bitcoin they contain digitally, the physical wallet needs to be destroyed. They just need to be issued by a known trustworthy source so people aren't paying with empty wallets.
Bitcoin provides the solution to many problems that exist with main stream currency. Because there is a market for these solutions, bitcoin has value.

First of all I have to give credit to [ch00f]( for giving me the idea [here]( I loved the idea and had to make my own! 
Here is the process:
1: Generate the QR code with Zint Barcode Studio
2: Save QR code as a svg file
3: Open in Illustrator, re-size, and offset paths smaller so the corners separate
4: Export from Illustrator as a dxf file
5: Create 3D geometry in Geomagic Design using the dxf file.
6: Generate g-codes in Geomagic design CAM.
7: Make some chips!
The machining setup is a bench-top CNC milling machine. I used a 3/16 2FL square end cutter, a 1/16 2FL ball nose cutter, and a 1/64 2FL ball nose cutter. The total machine time involved was about 2 hours. The material being cut is brass. The part, not including the loop is 1"X1". I just used marker to color the QR code. I'm going to chemically blacken the brass when I get the supplies. 
What I learned: 1X1 is too small!!! Next one I make is going to be 1.25" and I'll use a 1/32 cutter. 
If you would like one of these, I would like to sell you one! Please PM me if your interested. I'm thinking i can make these for around .2 btc. ($200) That price will vary depending on if you want a custom logo or inscription machined on the back. I'll have to do a few more prototypes, but i may be able to bring the price down depending on how much I can reduce the cut time and how much demand there is. 
There is a video of the CNC machine cutting the key-chain coming soon.
Edit: here is the video:

Perhaps the universe where banks are closing the accounts of anybody who runs a bitcoin related business. I just had to open an account in a different bank so I could transfer money to my exchange. These are Senators who regulate banks, not bankers. They have less understanding and different motivations than bankers.

I've been playing with a design and toolpath for this... My design is 1x1 pice of material using a 1/64" ball nose cutter I'm confident that I could cut this in under and hour using synthetic mist lubrication. I'd be running 7000 RPM as that is the maximum for my machine.
