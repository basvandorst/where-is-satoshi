OK, that's fair.  It wasn't mined before the public release.  However the fact that the creator was able to mine 4.8% of the coins all for himself gives it that premine feel (

Care to expand on that?  Energy efficiency is important for a global network, and Bitcoin is  inefficient at providing a global immutable ledger

This is one of Bitcoin's common myths.  Bitcoin's value is a function of its demand and scarcity.  The energy required to generate valid blocks does not affect the price - it is actually the opposite.  If bitcoin wasn't so expensive, then there would be less competition between miners and they wouldn't have to use so much energy


Bitcoin was premined.  In fact it is the ultimate premine. Satoshi ran almost all of the mining resources for over a year at a time when block reward was at its highest.  Here is an old article with some food for thought

Not too interesting in hodling Bitcoin to be honest.  A while ago I read a book on trading forex, but so far haven't been brave enough to put some money into trying it.  I stuck a few hundred into bitcoin a few weeks ago and that has rekindled my interest in the wider trading game.  eToro came up on my Facebook news feed and looked interesting.

You write some code in your own fork that improves the software in some way.  Then you send a request to the project owner for them to pull your fork into the main repository.  It’s one of the more popular ways to facilitate open source collaboration.  
I found it interesting that the software that does the merging was written by the same guy who wrote the original version of Linux, and he named it ‘git’ after himself.

For a miner `profit = fees collected + block reward - operating costs`.  As block reward shrinks, miners will look to fees to cover their operating costs and turn a profit.  Even with unbounded blocks, miners are not obliged to add all transactions into their block, so they can simply leave out txs with low fees.  Because some txs are left out, users of the system are encouraged to pay a fee high enough to get into the next block.  
Miners want to keep the system usable and fees low, because widespread adoption is how they will earn the most money.   For this reason, perhaps they would want to discourage users storing large chunks of data, and use a scaling fee system where you could pay up to $50k to store a 1TB backup.
It would probably work, but after a few years you might need a serious amount of hardware to run a node. 
The biggest issue I think is the effects on the internet at large.  There have been some experiments and predictions but in reality the effects are not really known.  It will probably be problematic for all internet users to be competing with enormous amounts of transaction data on the network.
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:03:01
In this hypothetical situation there are fees.  Miners aren't obliged to take all pending transactions.  The machine winning the block could impose a minimum fee and deliberately leave out all transactions that don't pay the fee.  The operating costs of mining will be extreme, so they will need fees to turn a profit.

And for the casual investor like me, it provides a nice amount of time to accumulate BTC at a rate which doesn't impact the rest of my personal finances.  I won't miss £50 per month and it *might* let me retire early one day.
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:26:40
I mean we're talking about 2.0 GB as the technical maximum, if there are enough transactions to fill it.  At this rate we could see blocks which are 0.0001% full.  Do you have any links with predictions about what might happen to the internet if there were 2GB blocks flying around?
Edit: unbounded sounds scary.  What's the anti-spam mechanism for unbounded blocks?
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:11:53


I am subbed to both and and I enjoy reading and commenting on technical material and adoption reports on both subs.  However I seem to observe lots of rude or agressive comments directed from to Meanwhile in the attitude seems to be a sense of smug arrogance and feeling that users of are yet to be enlightened.  Both subreddits are fairly toxic but you should be aware that you are representing your community before you type out aggressive comments
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:56:40
Based on a comment I just got from CSW, I actually think that would be welcomed by team BCH.  This is his response to my question about spam prevention in unbounded blocks.  tl;dr "It's not spam if you're paying for it".  Publishing a 1TB backup would cost you a fortune!

Would you be confident enough to store your retirement nest egg in Bitcoin?  There's no plan B if you accidentally lose your private key or reveal it to a crook.  These are real world concerns that can only really be solved by having a trusted organisation to look after your bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-02 12:14:37
You must only have a small amount stored in crypto, or you aren't be worried about losing it.  If you lose access to your wallet, or a crook gets access to it, you lose your bitcoin.  No backsies.  This is a big deal in the adoption battle, whether you like it or not.  Bitcoin gives you the freedom to store your money yourself if you like, just as you can store your savings as cash under your bed if you wish.  But the vast majority see that as too risky and use a bank to look after their savings.  Perhaps it's you who is looking at this with a closed mind attitude.  You shouldn't be turning people away from bitcoin, ever.  Of course rational people trust banks, as they are regulated.  To think otherwise suggests you've been in the echo chambers too long
@_date: 2019-03-02 11:11:52
Mainstream adoption can't happen without trusted organisations providing a level of protection to the average consumer.  The vast majority do not want to be totally responsible for all of their money.  They want a bank to look after it.  For the post-fiat world to exist, there must be some organisations who you can trust
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:24:32
Great!  It's just a shame about the centralisation 
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:31:08
It's not going to be difficult for me to find sources that back up the claim that most people use a bank or some other organisation to store their savings.  I'm not from the USA so I don't know much about the banking system there.  In the UK banks are heavily regulated in order to provide a high level of protection to consumers.  It's not a perfect system, and I can think of a few instances where people have been denied access to their money (Northern Rock in the UK, and the banking shutdown in Cyprus).  It's naive to think that ordinary people who aren't crypto enthusiasts will be thrilled about being solely responsible for managing access to their savings.   Regulated crypto banks are needed for some non-enthusiast users.  You're OK with non-enthusiasts using bitcoin aren't you?  Or do you want to keep it cult-y

Most banks in Ireland charge a fee to withdraw cash from an ATM.   The fee is charged by the bank rather than the ATM operator, so if you use a British card in an Irish ATM is no fee, but an Irish card at an Irish ATM will charge you a few cents on the euro.  The fee does have a yearly cap (I think it's €5) but was quite controversial when introduced

Say I have $10k in the bank and I want to purchase 1 BTC.  If I use a 12-month 0% credit card to buy the BTC, then I now have 1 BTC and $10k.  I can put the $10k in a low risk savings account, then withdraw it again in 12 months to pay off the credit card debt.  You pocket the interest gained on the negligible risk account.
It may only be a few hundred dollars, but it's free money for those disciplined enough to take advantage of it.  I trust the bank not to lose my savings account, but perhaps you don't

Thanks for a dose of sanity.  I'm investing in Bitcoin, but it's quite a small amount compared to my traditional much lower risk investments.  I'm not a single guy in my 20s like I assume most users in this sub are.  I believe in the need for a retirement plan that has a strong chance of success, and I do not believe that going all in on BTC offers that.

Disclipline is key.  In this situation you cannot spend the 10k cash in any circumstance, for anything other than paying off the CC.  I've been doing this for years and pocketing the free interest.  All expenses and bills are paid using a 0% CC, while all of my salary goes straight into a savings and investments.  I have several 0% cards that I pay the minimum monthly payment on, and clear when the 0% period is about to come to a close.  I've gone through the cycle of maxing the card then paying it off maybe 10 times already, so now I have access to some pretty decent cards.  My latest one is 28 months 0% purchases, £14k limit
