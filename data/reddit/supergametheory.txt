That’s just a comparison relative to other fiat currencies, or as I like to call them, “shitfiats”. It’s like comparing the value of Bitcoin against the relative values of other shitcoins. It really doesn’t tell you much.
But, compared to Bitcoin, the dollar is all over the place lately. Since last year it fell in value considerably against BTC. It’s only now trying to recover, and I really don’t think it’ll ever fully recover. So, I prefer to stick with good ol Bitcoin. It’s stable.

No, I’m pretty sure I have it right. You can look at the price history of the dollar against BTC at a bunch of different places. Not hard to verify at all. USD is so volatile right now.

@_date: 2019-03-06 23:18:15
After reading OP’s post, I was about to say the exact same thing.
Additionally, I think it would be neat if whatever committee, or organization, or whoever decides these things, establishes BTC as their standard unit of currency that all others are considered relative to. It’s international, neutral, and stateless. They can hash out the naming conventions from there, like if 1000 bitcoin is 1kBTC or 1kbtc or whatever.
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:30:30
No, because they see value as something independent of production cost.
For instance, the Mona Lisa could have a value of $100m to one person, or $200m to the next person. It’s intrinsic value is nill - it doesn’t do anything - and the exchange of money for the energy invested in it is long obsolete. The perceived value, however, has appreciated as demand increased. Art has subjective value that can’t be represented as just the sum of its parts.
I dunno. I’m a proponent of a sun/sugar based economy. I haven’t exactly worked the details out yet, but it’s a pipe dream.

That’s the gist of it, too. I think it’s easy to forget that the whole reason we have an economy is so we can properly designate the means of production to those who best produce for the desires of the public.
@_date: 2018-10-31 01:28:44
I’m not arguing against your point, because it’s completely valid and a good representation of the idea of value.
However, I do want to point out that the vast majority of energy we use here on Earth is originating from the sun (even fossil fuels). Further, nobody generates energy. All anyone does is transform solar energy into a different form (unless we’re talking nuclear...but even that came from some star).
For instance, all food is the transformation of solar energy. The sun is responsible for the energy put into corn and sugar, and is just as responsible for the energy put into cows and people. Each step in the food network is another useful transformation of solar energy.
With that in mind, the natural world already uses a number of different energy currencies, carbohydrates being a major one. Sugar is literally solar energy materialized. And, might I say, the natural world has been successfully using that energy currency for a very, very long time. Far longer than fiat lol.

Giving loans goes against the purpose of capitalism, which is to effectively designate the means of production to those who will produce best for the public. The best producers are the successful ones, and the successful ones have a surplus of saved value (capital). Why would we hand production over to people who are so unsuccessful that they don’t have the money upfront to produce? That’s just a waste of resources.

[“Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context.”](
[“A currency...in the most specific use of the word, refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.”](
I’d say cryptocurrency fits the bill as a currency, especially when everyone’s main drive in the crypto world is to establish currencies. The focus in development is on currency.
In Ethereum, that currency is used to exchange processing power, as well as goods and services.
I mean, if I’m wrong feel free to correct me.
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:51:52
I agree with what you’ve said, but for me it was an argument that stability is an illusion. Not even fiat is “stable”. It just seems that way because all anyone sees is the number in their bank account. Most people aren’t trading. The value of something is always in relation to something else. I mean, if we look at the price of the dollar in relation to an ounce of gold, it looks like the dollar is unstable. One ounce is always one ounce.

The free market is survival of the fittest. Free market capitalism may have come before Darwin, but the concepts are very much the same and originate from ideas of natural order.
I’m not sure what you mean about the bread, I don’t eat my bread before I bake it, but I do have the flour. Giving loans to a business is akin to giving them flour to bake before they’ve proven their recipes are what people want. There’s speculation that a market is there. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn’t. It’s very wasteful.
And, as a secondary, these businesses go about trying to sell their unproven wares by enticing the public with advertising, which is a nuisance to perception, hindering the natural psychological progress of the public, and uses manipulation to artificially raise the value of otherwise valueless products. Again, it’s all very wasteful.

I tried making this point in an economic sub once, and boy was I downvoted to hell. Apparently, in the economic world, the whole “money is energy” thing is a trope. They corrected me saying “money is value, not energy”.

I agree that the specialization of tasks is largely a good thing for production efficiency, but doing so also robs from societal efficiency by restricting the breadth of perspective each person has, limiting empathy. It also limits a persons perceived availability of choice, lending a hand toward depression. In other words, specialization of tasks pigeonholes the individual into a specific range of available experiences, which consequently limits their view of available conceptual understanding, and thus available choices.
For instance, we may want a doctor to fix people and not cars, but I want a doctor to know how to change oil, or flat tires, or just generally know how to fix and diagnose little things. Same with the nursing staff. If they have a flat tire, it’s much quicker and more efficient for them to fix it themselves rather than wait for a tow truck before they can come in and relieve the previous shift. Because they know things outside of their range of expertise, then can practice more efficiently.
Further, you may be an expert in a field, but having expertise in a diverse set of fields greatly expands your ability to drag in ideas and concepts outside the box. It’s not something to be taken lightly. I diagnose machinery for a living, but I have a huge leg up in my industry because I’ve also studied computer science, music, signal processing, and have a family full of medical professionals (which has lead me to study medicine in a non-professional context). Having that diversity of experience and conceptual knowledge makes me an innovator in my field. Without that information cross-talk, a person in my field only learns from the knowledge base already available in the field. They never advance beyond it and find it difficult to grasp advanced topics.
That same kind of information crosstalk is hugely beneficial to society in general. As the diversity of your conceptual understanding increases, you’re better able to stretch your perspective to encompass the perspective of others. This kind of awareness lends well to understanding and empathy, and is a natural deterrent to societal polarization. It also allows you to better pull in other foreign concepts and assimilate them with your own understanding.
And lastly, as I said, a diversity of conceptual understanding also allows the individual a wide breadth of visible choices, thus fending off depression, which is a perceptual rut that people can get stuck in when they see no choices available.
So, essentially what I’m saying is: yes, specialization of tasks is beneficial, but only to a certain extent. There’s a sweet spot in there we need to recognize...and hopefully we can engineer the norms of our society so our emergent behavior naturally lands in that sweet spot.
Edit: Bringing this full circle, there’s a lot of people out there who’ve lost the art of preparing their own food. They literally couldn’t boil water. That’s really bad lol. I mean, I should be complaining that we’ve lost the ability to survive in the wild on our own, but that argument would fall on deaf ears. The fact is, we’ve domesticated a lot of very useful skills out of our conceptual understanding because we’ve become entranced with the idea of specialization of tasks.

@_date: 2018-06-05 22:22:59
Crypto needs a killer app. It’s not good enough against fiat to be a killer app itself. It needs to be an integral part of a larger killer app.
For instance, there’s a painful number of small businesses out there that still rely on old tills that have to be balanced by hand. Further, many of those small business don’t usually have access to, or know how to use, advanced statistics with their sales. They also do their taxes manually or send stuff off to an accountant.
So imagine this: A raspberry pi with a bespoke OS loaded on it that includes an open source POS system that’ll also do statistics and tax stuff. Make the POS work natively with an exchange to accept any cryptocurrency or legal fiat, but the reference currency is Ether. The POS could utilize the network as a database. Total cost with a till drawer, printer, and screen could be somewhere under $300 (I’m guessing).
Then, work out a program with a local organization to help offset the costs to converting all the small businesses in the area to the new tills. Businesses with established POS systems might also switch over when they see the cost savings from no subscriptions or contracts.
You could train the local computer repair companies on how to work with and repair the new systems. They can be who the local businesses call when they need help.
It’s a win-win for everyone.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:22:48


That’s simply not true. Money doesn’t push good development, it pushes developments into areas that are beneficial for money. It’s a waste of energy.
People will always innovate...as a rule. It’s in our blood, and nothing will hold us back. If you’re only looking to innovate to get rich, then you’re wasting talents that could be put to good use.
And yes: I am completely ready to make less. At every point in time, the money I put away stays there and goes up in value. That means my income - or at least the numbers - can go down. But, I’ll always be making more in value.

A good portion of jobs out there are useless. I know: I’m one of the programmers that’s taken jobs away through automation...and I’ll keep doing it.
Not everyone is fulfilled in their job, either...and it’ll be impossible for them to find that fulfillment in that job. It’s not a matter of perception. You can’t just have a “good work ethic” and start feeling good about living like a robot. As long as you lack creativity, discovery, and human connection, no amount of money or belief in hard work or pills will take the depression away.
You’ll always be wasting eight hours of your life just so you can barely make something meaningful happen in another eight hours. And the whole system is there to prop itself up. We’re all working crap jobs to support other crap jobs just to keep this unnecessary behemoth cranking along.
Let the thing collapse already. I don’t want socialism or communism or whatever. I just don’t want us constantly making justification for crappy “economic expansion” just so it doesn’t collapse under its own weight. We need a system that doesn’t need that, and I think we’ve found it.

Your point does stand, but I think the analogy to use is that tcp/ip didn’t really become mainstream until there was a useful application abstraction layer added on top of it that everyone started using (http). That started with webpages in html back in 91, and it didn’t really get going until 95-96 with the html standard getting polished, Win 95 coming out, and AOL being a major player, sending out disks to every last soul on Earth.
It was honestly a perfect storm. HTML and the web was the new technology on the block but it wasn’t easily accessible to everyone. Win 95 was the thing everyone wanted because it was such an upgrade from Win3.1 and it provided a good experience along with IE in Service Release 1. AOL spread the gospel like no other and allowed everyone to try this internet thing out for free for a certain time. The thing is, regular users didn’t really get what the internet was until there was a bunch of buzz, and by that time they already had AOL disks in hand and computers that could dial up the internet.
An analogous situation today for crypto would be if Apple suddenly announced “Hey everyone, guess what? Our App Store runs on Ethereum now, you already have a wallet installed on your phones, and you can browse and start using DApps, like, yesterday.“
I’d really like for that to happen.

We have UberEats - or restaurants in general - because people have so little time from working their crap jobs, and so much stress, that they don’t want to bother with making their own food...especially if they’re inexperienced. Instead of socializing at home, they grab from a restaurant. Instead of creating at home, they grab from a restaurant. The restaurant (and UberEats) is a pill for deeper societal issues.
I’m not saying that restaurants all need to go away, but we’ve taken them to the unnecessary extreme. We don’t really need a McDonald’s on every corner, but we do when we’re so caught up in an economic system that turns us all into robots.
As for the car example, I want this scenario to happen. It’ll slow economic activity and keep people at home without taking value out of their pockets.

In practice they usually don’t. At most stores (not usually online), when you swipe your card, all you’re doing is sending notice that there’s a pending transaction. The merchant has to close out the batch for it to go through. Some merchants do it nightly, others wait a few days.
@_date: 2018-06-19 08:02:22
Right now, the fact that the hard cap is *a fact* is good enough. Plus, creation of more coin isn’t centrally manipulated, so inflation/deflation cannot be controlled in a sustained way, but everyone can still trust that scarcity will continue to escalate as adoption increases...especially if we all hold on to our coin...which means we can trust in a long-term deflation. That’s a lot of trust we can automatically have in this system.

The problem with cryptocurrencies (or really any minority currency) is it can be literally the best thing in the universe, but it’s worthless if people aren’t using it.

You get interest on the money in your account, but it’s always lower than inflation. So, you’re always losing money by keeping it in a bank. Never making money.
Your transactions cost money, even if you don’t see it. The cost of transactions get rolled into the cost of the product and the fact that the bank uses your money to make more money for themselves.
You very much still need to worry about viruses and theft, too. Fyi. And if there was identity theft, you still have to go through a process that many not get resolved.

The whole argument about transactions taking too long is a bunch of BS. It takes days for a check or credit card transaction to clear. That’s way longer than crypto. And the fees are there too.

Right...if the power is out and shtf, gold ain’t going to save your ass. You can’t make anything useful out of gold. There’s not enough of it in circulation to make it a common currency on the local scale (adoption is low). It’s hard to divide. It’s just useless. We’d honestly be better off using bottle caps.
Gold seems like a good idea because it had been used a lot in the past, but there was an infrastructure to support it. There’s no such thing now.
Plus, if you have any great investment in gold, it’s being held in a central vault and you won’t be able to transact jack if the power is out...and that’s presuming the owner of the vault would let you.
