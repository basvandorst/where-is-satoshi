True for the moment but will be fixed by cold-storage minting:

The foundations are under the control of the founders as at network inception they are the people who control the network. Who knows what situations will arise and what will be in the best interests of these people in the future. The point of decentralization is to prevent small groups of people like this having disproportionate power.
What if the founders decide to limit distribution in order to limit supply to the market and attempt to keep prices higher while they slowly cash out? Who controls the proof of stake voting rights of the foundations?

Yes they will vote in their best interests, but this will only be in the best interests of this handful of people who have large holdings, and so gives extremely disproportionate control to them relative to the other network participants. This is fine if this is what you want, but it is by definition centralization, yet they are claiming that they are more decentralized than other coins.
I do agree with much of what they say about proof of stake, but it can only be claimed to be more decentralized if the distribution itself is decentralized.

All Neucoins will be created at once and the majority distributed to angel investors and foundations under their control, so the network might never be decentralized as proof of stake voting rights will remain with this elite group. That is why proof of stake is only remotely feasible for a currency if the supply is well distributed.

Will these transparent foundations release all the details of the distribution? e.g. name, personal details, and transaction IDs of each recipient.
Otherwise, how can it be trusted not to be abused?

So then it is a matter of how wide the distribution of the coin is? If it is extremely well distributed then it would be unlikely for a single malicious party to obtain enough coins or minting keys to carry out an attack, possibly more unlikely than the situation that already exists with Bitcoin's mining pools. And I think it is a bit misleading to say that rewriting blockchain history is "effortless".

It only prevents any PoS coin with a centralized distribution or pre-mine from succeeding. If it is well-distributed then these third parties would be unlikely to be able to obtain enough coins to attack the network once it has matured to a high level of minting participation.

I think that possibility is extremely low. Many people who are interested in crypto are not the type to give their trust to centralized providers, especially as decentralized options are becoming more and more popular. Of course some will continue to use them, but obtaining 51% of the minting power in practice would be extremely difficult. I am more worried about the very real threat of mining centralization that already exists in Bitcoin.
