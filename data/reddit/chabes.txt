Was a fork needed to implement the block size limit in the first place? Not trolling. Genuinely curious, since a fork is required for modifying the limit
Edit: just found [this thread]( from this time last year. Seems that the change was initially implemented quietly in a bug fixing update, and that a change like that nowadays would be contentious and therefore much more likely to cause a hard fork. You're there, btw. Lol

The app is available in the US, but there's no tellers yet. Seems like kind of a pointless app at this point. You can buy bitcoin with a bank account and send it to another abra user. That's pretty much it. Not really of use to someone without a bank account until tellers are available

Bought a raspberry pi and insulated water bottle on purse.io. It took a while to get the order picked up (I had insisted on a larger discount, since I didn't need the products right away), but once it was ordered it took a day or two to get to me. In the meantime, the bitfinex hack occurred and the price dipped quite a bit, but my purchase was already in escrow so I got the older better price. I also replenished my wallet with cheaper coins while the price was still low.
All in all, it was a great experience on my end

I haven't had a bank account for the last 5 years. Before bitcoin, I was trying to save some cash in my bedroom, but was never able to save more than a couple hundred dollars (I live off of about $500 a month, including housing costs). Last year I bought bitcoin when the price was around $230 for a while. My "savings account" is worth around $600 now, which might not sound like much to most people, but is more than I have been able to put away in years (even when I still used banks to save money). Bitcoin is changing my financial situation in a constructive way. I'm so grateful to have a resource like bitcoin!

Yeah, I've used em before. First, check their map to see if there's any locations around you. Then sign up on their website. If I remember correctly, there is some identity verification of sorts. I can't recall how in depth it is. Once you have an account set up, you can buy a PIN number over the counter at eligible locations. After you've bought a PIN number, log in to your account (or use their smartphone app) and enter the number. In seconds the bitcoin are sent to the wallet address you provide. Afaik, all locations accept cash, and I imagine many of them also accept pay cards (visa gift cards) and whatnot

Andreas Antonopoulos, first and foremost. Siraj Raval is another good one, though he isn’t always talking about cryptocurrencies (often discusses AI/deep learning).

Another great YouTube resource is conference live streams. Scaling Bitcoin and Breaking Bitcoin are some that I remember off the top of my head.

What's that? Do I smell.... bullshit??
[This is a non-segwit transaction]( recently included in [this block](
Fee = 0.0009 btc (about $9.50)
total sent = 1.65472116 (about $17,600.00)
time to first conf = **10 min**
0.0009 / 1.65472116 = 0.0005439 or **0.05**439 % (someone check my maths, plz)
Even *if* Western Union allowed transfers that big, the fees would already be well over $100, but **they don't allow anything over $7499**.
A transaction from WU wouldn't be cleared in 10 min. Nor is it truly borderless. Or censorship resistant. Or permissionless. Or any of the things that make bitcoin great.
Yes, a $9.50 fee is too high for buying a cup of coffee, and too high for the average Venezuelan to use regularly, but that's another discussion (see countless other discussions about scaling, lightning, schnorr, best-practices like batching, etc).

Mempool being full isn’t what makes bitcoin scarce. Mempool being full makes **block space** scarce. There’s only ever gonna be 21 mil bitcoin. Using the LN locks up bitcoin. Only 21 mil could ever be locked up (less actually)
If funds are “locked up” because fees are too high, many people won’t transact because it’s too expensive. Then the market actually responds to the increased “scarcity” with a decline in the exchange rate (like the 50% drop we just saw over the last month), because the utility of bitcoin is in question

No worries. When you right-click an address or transaction, you can open a “details” window. This shows all kinds of info. The personally identifiable information would be any of those details associated with you (your addresses, transaction id’s, dates, and balances). Some folks don’t mind sharing this info, but privacy-minded individuals keep info like that private to avoid associating their reddit account with their on-chain transactions (though, one could always make a throwaway account to help obfuscate their tracks). If you don’t care all that much, don’t worry about blacking out info, just send me the screenshot(s) in a direct message. I’ll see what I can do.

If transferring from a wallet that doesn’t let you set your own fee, that could definitely be an issue, with the current state of the fee market/mempool.

Everyone has different acceptable levels of decentralization. Bitcoin is opt-it. No one is forcing anyone to run nodes.
However, you have the benefit of living in a place (I’m assuming) with reliable internet connectivity. You probably have plenty of bitcoin nodes within a few hops. [This guy]( does not.
Either way, the only way to use bitcoin in a fully trustless manner is to run your own full node (or even a few). Otherwise, you’re relying on a third party for blockchain validation.

You don’t have to. However, running a full node allows you to use bitcoin in a fully trustless manner. Trustless, as in not having to trust a third party. The blockchain is verified by your node. This also allows you to relay validated blocks to the rest of the network. The more nodes validating and relaying, the more decentralized the network is. If the nodes were all in data centers, the network would be much more vulnerable to centralized attacks

I think this is the gist.. Signatures used in signing transactions take up space. Instead of including all signatures in a block, signatures are aggregated by making a single signature out of the combination of all the included signatures, thereby freeing up block space for transactions
**Edit**: as (author of the linked article) pointed out, this post is about another block-space-saving technique, beyond schnorr *signature* aggregation, called MuSig, which involves *key* aggregation
Edit 2: so, after reading further, my current understanding is this: MuSig is a multi-sig scheme where all participants use their public keys to make an aggregate public key. Does that mean all involved public keys would be unknown?

Increasingly skeptical because it wasn’t clear to me where you got your info. It’s clear now.
So, what’s to say the mempool isn’t being gamed by miners? A miner could easily fill the mempool with many low-fee transactions that would never confirm because there’s enough block space demand to add enough high-fee transactions on top. Keep filling up the floor of the mempool with high-value low-fee transactions, and you keep the high fees nice and high. That is, until the network truly scales, and it becomes too risky to broadcast the low-fee mempool spam. That will depend on how fast the mempool can clear, and how decentralized mining is

I’m guessing it’s because of the fee (which is silly considering how much the mempool has cleared lately). Bitpay’s fee estimation is severely broken. This is intentional on their part, as they are pivoting away from bitcoin, and towards bch, unfortunately. I’d look for an alternative wallet
Edit: for the record, both bitpay and Coinbase have been too comfortable in their incumbency. Both are making more money than ever, have more users than ever, and have little incentive to do what is best for the community. This will come back to bite them in the ass, because the community is going to move forward without them. Mark my words

People *are* going to other networks for cheap and fast transactions at the moment. This is a good thing. Takes some pressure off of the bitcoin network, thus allowing reasonably paced scaling. Also reduces the noise brought on by the masses of noobs and get-rich-quick slimeballs. These systems are pretty damn good at self-healing/self-correcting.

Just trying to make sense of what I read. Your dad is right for not wanting to take too big of a risk. It seems to me that you are excited about the price rise and want to get in on it while you can. Bitcoin is an amazing technology, and is getting better, thanks to the many people who are making it so. It’s just best to know what you’re getting into before investing other people’s money. If the price drops too much too quickly, your dad will want his money back, even if you believe it will recover.

The issue is businesses intentionally dragging their feet on segwit implementation.

Part of the community split off in 2017.
Bitcoin was on the road to implementing an upgrade (segwit) to reduce transaction size (and, therefore, reduce transaction fees), and some folks wanted to have the block size raised, instead of using this new upgrade. The ones who didn’t want segwit rallied behind multiple alternative implementations, before most of them got behind Bitcoin Cash/BitcoinABC.
The fork happened in August of 2017, and involved forking the existing bitcoin blockchain (up to block 478558), and mining new bitcoin cash blocks. The Bitcoin blockchain continued with its own blocks, as well.
Anyone who had bitcoin before the split, now had spendable outputs on both chains.
It gets more complicated after that, as there were other fork chains, and even some of the forks had forks of their own.

He never said the system was designed to process that rate of transactions. He said that’s what the Visa network processed, and if bitcoin were to reach that level, it would take 100gb of bandwidth (about $18 *a day*) for anyone who wants to run a node. Let’s not take it out of context

So what’s wrong with calling it bcash? Calling it Bitcoin causes unnecessary confusion for newcomers. Everyone involved with bcash knows the b stands for bitcoin. Why cause unnecessary fuckery? There’s just no reason. The only logical conclusion is that **they need the bitcoin brand**. They would have no market cap without it. All of these untouched coins being counted in the market cap is ridiculous. Most will never be touched. You can’t just fork a network and say, “oh look at that huge market cap that just appeared out of nowhere on August 1st, 2017. So much invested. Such wow”. It has value because it was pumped into existence. People saw an opportunity for free money. “Woo hoo! Bring on the airdrops! Yee yee! Free coinz!”

When critics of bitcoin say that bitcoin is unusable because the network is congested, it's like saying "no one can use bitcoin because everyone is using bitcoin", or like saying "no one goes to that restaurant anymore because it's too crowded all the time."

i haven't been able to save money for years, aside from keeping cash in a tin under my bed.
when i had a bank account, they would charge a monthly fee for not having enough money, thus reducing what little money i had to nothing. if i wasn't paying attention, the last fee could put me over the edge, into the negative. how are you even supposed to get an overdraft fee out of someone with no money? i guess that'll have to come out of your next deposit... but we'll charge a few more overdraft fees, in the meantime.
thanks to bitcoin, for the first time in my life, i have a savings that i am in control of. i can actually save the small amounts that would get eaten up by jp morgan/chase for burdening them with my meagre savings.

hi max. thank you for reaching out! i do have a couple questions.
what's the least expensive method to purchase bitcoin through LBC? i'm mostly interested in cash-based purchases, since i don't have a bank account. i've heard about the cash deposit method, and it seems like it could work for me, though the exchange rates looked a little steep, from what i remember. do the rates go down once i gain a more trustworthy reputation? or is the rate listed on a posting completely in the control of the seller?
also, do you have any advice for a first-time buyer that is doing a cash transaction in person? how safe is it? i figure it could be made safer by meeting in a public place, like a coffee shop. are there common red flags i should be looking for?

i realized these "LibertyX locations" are basically stores that can re-up calling card minutes (MetroPCS, for example) using a system such as Qpay. Qpay also lets you purchase libertyX pins.
when i bought my pin from the MetroPCS store i went to, i asked them (in-person) if i could purchase a Qpay pin for LibertyX. The woman behind the counter knew they used Qpay for stuff, but was unfamiliar with libertyx. she still found it easily on whatever drop-down menu she was looking at. she read to me that all sales were final and there are no refunds. i got a little nervous, but handed her my cash in good faith, since i would be getting a receipt. in the end, it worked, and was very easy...almost too easy

This is a great idea. I think, instead of talking shit about this new website, we could give constructive feedback, so it could become more of what the creators intended it to be. They *just* began the beta testing, after all.
I was recently thinking about selling some of the pictures I take on my thru-hikes and rock climbing adventures, but I have no idea where to host pictures for sale. I did a little googling, and found out about multiple stock image databases that pay royalties to photographers. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any cryptocurrency related sites for selling photos (they probably exist, I just haven't found them yet...not sure exactly what to search for).
If this PhotoBTC site is a simple way for me to receive bitcoin for my photos, I'll probably end up joining. I'll definitely be following their progress in the coming days and weeks to see what unfolds.

Bitcoin has been around since 2009. Bitcoin Cash is the result of a split in the network on August 1, 2017. Was supposed to be a peaceful split, but their coin wasn’t wanted enough by the market, so now they attack bitcoin and act like it’s the “real bitcoin”/“sotoshi’s vision”
Edit, for clarity: the split was based on disagreement as to how to best scale the network. Majority wanted to use a technique called segregated witness (originally proposed as a tx malleability fix), that separated witnesses data from transaction data before including it in a block, thereby allowing more of the block space to be used for transaction data.
Miners (and proponents of a different method of scaling) opposed this upgrade (especially Bitmain and related companies), and made it clear that they would rather raise the maximum size a block could be (like adding more lanes to a congested road)
Since the first method (segregated witness) effectively raises the block size anyway, while also fixing tx malleability, thus paving the way for second layer solutions/off-chain-scaling, most users were on board with the upgrade.
Miners were/are driven by financial incentives, and opposed the upgrade. Bitmain (Jihan Wu and friends) and bitcoin(dot)com (Roger Ver and friends) joined forces to push the Bitcoin Cash fork (originally BCC). They still try to mislead newcomers into believing that Bitcoin Cash *is* bitcoin.

History fact check:
started because of an anti-censorship sentiment that spread across the majority of reddit during the Ellen Pao debacle (in 2015). Theymos pissed off some folks who supported consensus altering protocol changes, and they made a sub to talk about it without fear of moderation. It became a place to freely talk about alternative implementations (XT, Classic, eventually bcash), so it attracted many who oppose the direction bitcoin was headed.
Months went by, and the sub became mostly vocal big-blockers, led by loudmouth out of touch narcissist Roger Ver. The more trolls they attracted, the harder it became for rational people to stick around. It got really bad in early 2017, and progressively worse throughout the year.
Now that bitcoin has moved forward anyway, and the big blockers have their own fork chain, you’d think the vitriol would go away. It hasn’t.

This is BS. If you have $164k of some asset that’s as easy to send as email, there is nothing stopping you from being able to spend little bits here and there. If the value keeps going up, the amount you end up shaving off with each purchase becomes less and less.
Unless you’re retiring on your 20 btc, you’re probably still earning an income of some sort, and it’s trivial to just re-purchase the amount btc you’ve spent (especially if you buy the dips).
Edit - also wanted to add: deflationary money *does* encourage saving, but that doesn’t mean spending disappears entirely. It just reduces frivolous spending/consumption. **This is a good thing**

When you are in control of your own bitcoin (private keys), only you are responsible for keeping them safe. If the risk of using a centralized target of potential hacking/theft/etc (internally and externally) to hold your keys is acceptable to you, go for it. Just know that there are no guarantees that you can get your money if something happens to the exchange.
Instead, take some time to learn how to use bitcoin. You spent money to get bitcoin on an exchange, so now you are financially incentivized to understand it (lest you run the risk of losing your precious bits).

I've used bitcoin as my personal savings for some time now, without having a bank account at all. I can tell you that I have more value saved now than I would have if I had put it in a bank. Yes, there's risk involved, but if you keep up with current events in the community, you'll be able to develop a fair understanding of the direction of things, and the risk will be easier to manage.
I can tell you this much.. Bitcoin helps me personally save for the future, much more than banking ever has. It is because of bitcoin that I've been able to have a savings at all. I haven't had a bank account in years. I closed mine because I couldn't keep enough money in it or use it enough to avoid constant $10 fees, which drained my account. Their policy is make the poor poorer until they stop banking with them. They have little incentive to get involved with you at all, unless you can consistently provide fees to them. Bitcoin gives me an alternative. It actually feels amazing to save when you're the one saving. Putting money in a bank just never felt nearly as satisfying.
My advice: try it with a small amount. See how it goes

Blockstream doesn't hide the fact that they have had multiple successful investment rounds. Just because you haven't witnessed discussion doesn't mean it doesn't (or hasn't) happen(ed). Just because you don't know what the goal of their business model is, doesn't mean they haven't been transparent. They have been consistent in their transparency. Please at least do a quick google search before assuming things and spreading more misinformation. Maybe start [here](
Yes, the miners are joining the conversation, but that doesn't mean that Blockstream have been silent. From my perspective, the folks from the other sub have been more vocal, and proactively try to push their ideologies on the community as a whole. Meanwhile, rational individuals make their point heard, and if people don't want to hear it they won't. They don't keep trying to force their ideology on others. This makes them seem relatively quiet, compared to the extremely vocal minority.
Most of the discussion coming from Blockstream is actually technical discussion. This is what is important to a group of developers working to improve the protocol. Blockstream seems quiet around Reddit due to the fact that **most of the technical discussion happens outside of Reddit**.

There has been a debate about how to scale the network over the last few years that intensified about 2 years ago. The divisiveness came more recently. Talk of alternative implementations was strangled on so was made in response. then slowly devolved into a den of people who yell more loudly than others as chilled out from the reduction of non-technical shitposting (still has plenty, just less). Roger Ver (early bitcoin investor) got all fired up because the mindless masses started flocking to him on as their bitcoin Jesus as he sought to take on the established status quo and their censorship machine.

Not true. There were 8 different versions of lightning being developed and tested as of the writing of [this article]( (Nov 2016). Could be more now. Some versions have been tested more than others.

It's called the bitcoin dev irc channel. Or the mailing list. Or the slack channel. Even twitter has plenty of open discussion.
Btw, blockstream and core refer to two different things. However, both are radically transparent.

Besides the fact that my post wasn't even specifically about core, they spammed my personal inbox with almost the same copy/pasted reply, except they ended with this:


Obvious shill. I can't even make this shit up. If BU was so superior, why would someone have to spam people into switching to their software? It's pretty ridiculous, if you ask me. I don't know what your definition of insanity is.
Anyway, on to the "facts"...


Seems to be working. More people using the network, and more money being involved than ever before.


I'm aware of the backlog situation. I'm also aware of a series of solutions that are being stonewalled at the moment. Segwit, lightning, using schnorr signatures. These are solutions proposed by and developed by, you guessed it...developers.


Those seem like pretty atypical situations, though I've heard of low fee transactions taking many days when the network is busy. I've never heard of a $100 fee, though I could imagine someone transferring a lot of money and spending an extra hundred on a guaranteed spot in the next block.


I believe you're referring to their patenting of the sidechains idea. Blockstream has publicly stated their stance on defensive patenting. They either don't patent their work and keep it private, or keep their work open by holding patents defensively. They(we)'d get screwed over by opportunists trying to make a buck. Also, blockstreams patents are freely available to use without licensing fees or litigation. They will only ever use their patents for defensive purposes.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:22:45
Let's try to be a little more rational with our discussions, instead of settling with unsubstantiated claims. Please try and at least know somewhat about what you're trying to persuade people of. There's plenty of information about LN implementations out there. A little due diligence wouldn't hurt.
Here's a start: 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:39:08
I think it still has to download all 120gb, but only keeps the 5gb of the latest blocks. It starts at the genesis block and deletes the early blocks after reaching the pruning limit you set, using the early blocks to validate all subsequent blocks, if I understand correctly 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:37:45
It's not that they're poor communicators. It's that **most of the technical discussion isn't happening on Reddit**. The signal to noise ratio on Reddit is extreme. Too many people who don't really know what they're talking about, acting like they do

AFAICT, Blockstream wants segwit, schnorr sigs, LN, etc. These all lead to lower fees for users. It actually has a lot more to do with financial incentives for **miners**, aka transaction fees

When exactly was the 1mb limit created? What was the state of mining when the limit was created?
I don't know the specific answers to these questions, but it seems obvious to me that if Satoshi was still around making decisions, then mining was still far from the state it is now. The specific details would probably help to see the bigger picture

For safe long term storage, definitely get a hardware wallet.
**BitBox02** hardware wallet from Shift Cryptosecurity is super legit. It is sleek, yet not super eye catching. It’s easy to use, the app is great (and keeps getting better, with active development and solid updates), and their support is top notch. The device can be backed up on a micro SD card. It’s also USB-C, which is nice if you use USB-C, and has an adapter for typical USB-A.
The team at Shift Cryptosecurity has been super busy this year, releasing the BitBox02, as well as starting the alpha programs for their BitBox Base full node solution and a special tamper evident packaging (that they plan to use in the future to ensure that hardware wallets, sd cards, cables, etc. haven’t been altered or messed with).

I like the newest BitBox. It is pretty simple to use. The UX of their app keeps getting better.

I feel like the dogecoin community is much better at welcoming newcomers than the bitcoin community.
I'd rather see newcomers sent to than be given some snarky response that makes them feel dumb and unwelcome. They can learn about cryptocurrency in a safe space, get tipped thousands of doge, tip others, see what it's like to have money in the form of private keys, and what to do to secure and backup those keys, etc, etc. Once they start down the path, they'll inevitably end up back here with bitcoin, but with a newfound understanding of the basics, which will help them grasp the more advanced topics a little easier

One of the features of Bitcoin that make it useful is decentralization. 2x circumvents the current development community. Protocol development is effectively being hijacked, because a handful of companies had an agreement.

Measuring certain (albeit popular) on ramps of a freeway will not give you a good measure of freeway usage. It will show you plenty about newcomers and institutional investors, but many individuals who have been involved with bitcoin for multiple years don't use exchanges. Exchanges are for buying and selling currencies. Some people work for bitcoin, some only buy and sell p2p, and some refuse to give up privacy. You just can't account for a large segment of real legitimate users by measuring only exchange data.

sorry that took so long. finally found some time to sit down and reply. here goes..


good on ye


this is very true. everyone is tired of the vitriol. i'm even sick of the word vitriol, at this point. thanks for participating


not really. "core" is a decentralized group of developers who independently or collaboratively work on Bitcoin development. the fact is that none were invited to participate in the nya. probably because the few developers who were involved in the hka were against the idea of 2x in the first place (when 2x was proposed earlier this year, not necessarily the hka proposal, though some were opposed to that too, even though they agreed to compromise)


let's put it this way... would you rather trust a loosely collected group of software developers (who probably have personal financial self-interest that shares similar priorities with philosophical concerns, depending on the individual), individuals with mostly cypherpunk roots/backgrounds? or would you rather trust an organized cartel of companies and individuals with financial self interest as their main priority? not 100% trust, just trust in general.
which do you think has the best interest of bitcoin at heart? i'll give you a hint: one cares about bitcoin, and the other cares about the exchange rate of bitcoin. smell the difference?




the discussions go back to almost the very beginning of bitcoin (such as the bitcointalk thread about block size with satoshi and garzik), but the heat got turned up with gavin's blog posts in early-mid 2015


the agreement was segwit first, then see if doubling the blocksize makes sense. as of this writing, segwit still hasn't been enabled (though it is set to in less than 24 hours), so we haven't even seen the state of the network with segwit in use.


you make it sound as if there was some sort of collusion. individuals who participate in development had varying opinions, but the overall sentiment was: don't change too much, too fast, or you'll break it. let's scale correctly, even if it takes longer than the get-rich-quick kinds of users would like.


what about bitmain's part to play in that? what about asicboost?


the reality is that reddit as a whole was going through an anti-censorship frenzy associated with the former ceo ellen pao censoring whole subs, as well as many posts being deleted (which is why was started, though it was months before the pao debacle). there were lots of users here (myself included) who wanted to talk about alternative implementations of bitcoin (xt, classic), but that kind of discussion was against the rules of this sub (see sidebar: "Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted."). many users disagreed that we shouldn't be able to talk about protocol altering client software that lacks overwhelming consensus (how would there be consensus if people can't discuss it?, we wondered), so was created as a less moderated alternative to this sub. because of the anti-censorship political climate of reddit at the time, and the desire to discuss alternative client software, many users went to for discussion of xt and classic (and eventually unlimited, btc cash, etc.. won't be the last either). i found myself there just as much a this sub, at first. things have definitely changed, for the worst, since then, unfortunately.


proliferation of spam attacks, misinformation, and political dissent were the goals of bitmain, with the intent of stalling segwit so that bitmain may get the most out of their asicboost technology. sorry if you can't see the writing on the wall


would love to see some evidence. like i said before, the discussions that were getting deleted had to do with protocol altering client software, and were breaking the rules of this sub. this place was a shitshow before the moderators stepped up moderation. the shitshow has a home at now, yet they still spread their poison to as many outlets as possible, including here.


you skipped the part about uasf.
development stalled because of bitmain. roger ver helped that by charging up the angry crowd to do his bidding, even going so far as to pay to use their pool and pay for tweets. i wouldn't be surprised if it was exposed that they were buying old reddit accounts and using them for a shill army. time may tell.
anyway, here's how it went: bitmain and their related pools (viabtc, btc.com, as well as roger's bitcoin.com pool) were the *only* ones blocking the activation of segwit by refusing to signal (even though they were a major part of the hka). users said, if you won't activate the software we want, we won't relay your blocks on our nodes. simple. hence uasf. now, it's debatable whether or not uasf would have worked, since segwit reached the signalling threshold by august 1st, and it didn't have to activate. the reason signalling reached that threshold is because uasf forced some major players to come together to make sure bitcoin doesnt't break and have to change the pow algo. pow algo would have been changed if nya didn't get the reluctant miners to signal. these same miners now jump from btc to bch, mining the main chain when it is most profitable, and trying to pump bch to allow it to stand on it's own legs. [edit: forgot to mention the bitcoinabc/bitcoincash masf proposed by bitmain, as well as the future of bitcoin conference, with craig wright still claiming to be satoshi and pushing for centralization. what a circus it's been]


just like that. poof!


most developers were/are against 2x/btc1 because it is an attempt to wrest control of protocol development from a decentralized group of individuals, and give that control to the companies/individuals with the most money. totally not a cryptoanarchist/cypherpunk thing to do, at all.


fair enough. i'll maintain that the stall was actually caused by bitmain, with help from roger and friends. roger personally pumps altcoins on a regular basis.
some major developers who have left: gavin andreesen and mike hearn are notable examples. vitalik left a while ago for his pet project, ethereum. most others continue to be involved through github, irc, and the mailing list. not sure what developers you're talking about. jeff, maybe?
anyway, just wanted to say that, although i disagree with you about many things, i appreciate the ability to have a discussion with you that doesn't resort to trolling. thank you.

@_date: 2017-08-25 22:12:59


lol, ok. dwelve as far as you'd like


poor choice of words, on my part. i'll admit, that's definitely way to broad and unrealistic


**ideal**: fair (diverse) representation of each branch of the community. by this, i mean the miners, developers, exchanges, merchants, and users. obviously this is unrealistic, but would be ideal, if possible.
**realistic**: at least *some* representation from *most* of these groups.
**undesirable**: the most corporate representation of a few of those groups
the hka could have been more diverse. there were less than 40 individuals that were signatories, who represented about 20 companies/groups. 5 of those individuals were developers, which, to put it into perspective, was the amount of representation that bitmain had. go figure, bitmain is actually behind the breaking of the fellowship, when they say "i finally read segwit. it sucks." by they, i mean jihan.
the agreement that was broken was: segwit first, then hard fork to a bigger blocksize limit (based on improvements in segwit) a few months later. this hard fork would *only* be released with broad community support. go figure.
the agreement also says, "we are committed to scaling technologies which use block space more efficiently.” lest we forget.


miners might *think* they control the system, but they don't. they are but some of the deciders, in a sea of deciders. all fully validating nodes are the deciders, collectively.
hell, even developers think they steer the boat, but they don't either. nobody has to run software they don't want to run. the ones running the software decide. if you disagree, don't run the software


oh sure, some of them want those things. abra was one of the participants in the nya, and that's their whole deal. i don't disagree that *some* of the participants align with these philosophies.


emphasis added ^
forced fee markets? segwit has been available since last year, but bitmain refused to signal for many months, effectively stalling progress. can't stall it forever, though. the community has decided that segwit is the way forward


not hard forks... *contentious* hard forks that are rushed (like a shitty bill trying to weasel it's way through legislature). "conservative, minimal changes, that are safely done, with plenty of notice, and minimal destruction", in the words of andreas (i know how much you love him). you seem to think that there is broad community consensus for 2x, which is not the case.


hahahahahahaha!!! wow! you sound like such an angry person. take a breath, man. stress kills


yes, i can

Those millions were most likely acquired from mining in the first place (invest in equipment, profit, keep some, put some back into new equipment, profit, etc). He's probably already had a profitable operation for some time now. His future profits depend upon the proper scaling of Bitcoin (and LTC), but he could most likely cash out at some point and be just fine.
Devs have more of an altruistic approach, it seems. It's like you can tell that they actually give a shit, for more reasons than just profits. And they definitely know more of the nitty gritty than a mining pool operator.
I find it quite strange to see someone claiming that some profiteer has the deepest understanding of Bitcoin because of financial incentive. Devs might not understand Bitcoin the best (though they probably do.. but, there's many layers of Bitcoin, so who can really say?), but they sure as shit understand it better than some mining pool operator. You don't need to know as much as a dev does to operate a successful mining pool (a LTC pool, at that)

We’ll see devs using their own money to help users open channels before we see them rush an impromptu hard fork. If they’re going to raise the block size, it will be done over a long period of time with plenty of opportunity for everyone to get on board before flipping the switch on the new rules. Don’t expect it to get rushed out because of fees. If fees rise too much, people won’t use the network, and those that do will have to optimize their block use efficiently, so fees will go down, and then back up, and down, etc.
This pressure to optimize will probably always be around. Like the internet itself, it must keep scaling to accept new users and features. The web, streaming audio and video (recorded or streaming live), online games, etc. all put pressure on the structures of the internet and force it to continually grow. Just this week, folks at Netflix were talking about how they need to keep up innovation with video compression standards. It’s an interesting article (you can check it out [here](

Like said, bitpay should properly inform their customers of the risks involved with running a forked version of Bitcoin. People are going to assume "this is Bitcoin", yet we won't know which is actually Bitcoin until after the fork happens. Bitpay doesn't get to decide what is Bitcoin and what isn't. That's what is so shady about claiming that an alternate implementation is Bitcoin without informing customers about the reality. They are deciding for their users, because their business model depends on it.

it's not like it was the entire ecosystem coming together to do what's best for bitcoin. it was a handful of companies/exchanges/miners. these participants want bitcoin to have a high exchange rate. they don't care about the philosophy of bitcoin. bitcoin allows us to control our money without financial institutions. bitcoin was made to circumvent their control, and you are just ok with giving that control back to them, apparently

Learn more about things you want to invest in. You might learn that bitcoin is not about exchange rate value, unlike what so many here and on twitter will tell you. Bitcoin is a system of money that no one controls. No one to ask permission to use your own money (unlike a bank/cc). As long as you secure your keys, you are the only entity in the known universe that has control over your bitcoin.

From ch1 of Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos:


Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention is also a practical and novel solution to a problem in distributed computing, known as the "Byzantine Generals' Problem." Briefly, the problem consists of trying to agree on a course of action or the state of a system by exchanging information over an unreliable and potentially compromised network. Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution, which uses the concept of Proof-of-Work to achieve consensus without a central trusted authority, represents a breakthrough in distributed computing and has wide applicability beyond currency. It can be used to achieve consensus on decentralized networks to prove the fairness of elections, lotteries, asset registries, digital notarization, and more.

There's incentive to secure your money. If they don't think their savings or mortgage is worth securing, then *that's* another thing.
Why tell anyone? Methods of securing cryptocurrencies will become common knowledge when everyone is familiar with the new technology. I believe the technology has to continue to mature to achieve this. I also think that by the time there is widespread adoption, the technology will have had time to reach a certain level of maturity. By that time, I imagine there will be a strong foundation of security best practices for securing your digital wealth that is well known by the general public.
I guess my point is that people already do things to secure their money (hide in a drawer or under a mattress, lock in a personal safe, deposit in bank, etc), and asking people to properly secure their non physical money doesn't seem very far fetched to me

I’m not a financial advisor, by any stretch of the imagination, but I can speak on my own experiences.
First of all, I still use cash for most of the transactions I make. Cash is still king in 2019.
When I started buying bitcoin, I had already been living without a bank account for 4 years. I didn’t close my bank accounts to “go all in” on bitcoin or whatever, because I didn’t even know bitcoin existed back then. I was literally hoarding cash before then.
The main point I’d like to make is: Living without a bank account is not easy. Most of the world around me is still extremely tied to the existing financial system, and trying to live alongside the system causes a lot of friction.
Being paid with a paycheck when you don’t have a bank account is annoying. You have to basically go through a third party to get your money (money you already worked for).
I’d much rather be paid directly in bitcoin. Or better yet, I’d like to be paid in lightning, streaming/on-demand, earning satoshis for every second I’m clocked in.
Paying for things online is annoying, when the seller doesn’t accept bitcoin as a payment method. I’ve had to borrow someone else’s (family or friends’) debit card for online purchases, while paying them directly with cash.
Many people I know still use PayPal and Venmo for paying people directly, but those systems aren’t friendly to users that haven’t linked their personal bank account. Also, Venmo only works with the app now (web portal doesn’t let you send money anymore, as if this year).
This would all be much easier if more folks were on the bitcoin bandwagon. There is much more adoption than when I first got involved with bitcoin, but we still have a ways to go.
My advice to you: start small. (It sounds like you’re already on this track, which is great)
I didn’t have a stable income, so I started with $20 and $50 purchases of bitcoin when I had a surplus of income. When income dried up, I spent a little to keep the wheels greased. This is a great way to start accumulating, without taking all of your disposable income.
Most of the time, I hodl, which involves not spending so much. I learned to do this well when I was a poor student, living in communal housing.
I’m also not your average bitcoiner. I live an unconventional lifestyle that involves living in the wilderness for periods of time, foraging for wild edibles, dumpster diving, and living a semi-migratory existence. I also grow some of my own food, and offer consultation services to help others grow food.
Bottom line, though, is that you (anyone, really) can do it. Start small, and accumulate over the long term. That way you won’t be stressing about price fluctuations. I’m not a rich person, but I at least have a little more financial stability than I did before. Bitcoin is the reason. (Thank you for coming to my TED Talk)
Edit: just saw a great clip from a talk by Andreas Antonopoulos, and he is basically saying the percentage of your wealth in bitcoin should be proportional to the amount you understand the technology. I think that is a good general guideline.

And there it is..
This matters not, then:










Even if miners weren’t using the code above which would possibly have prevented them creating bigger blocks, they would have customized their software to find larger blocks for block 494784, not 494783. This would have caused the same stall at block 494782 and everyone would have started to try to debug what was causing the problem.

the website is for timestamping with the blockchain. it's not supposed to be a directory of brainwallets, but it uses brainwallets. not sure what the op is trippin on.
the main point to the site/service is **trusted timestamping without a third party** (see [here](
the timestamping only uses dust, so there's only a reward of 1 satoshi per entry, if someone wanted to take them. it would be more profitable to use faucets.
btw, the transaction *is* the timestamp, so transacting that money again wouldn't erase the original entry
also, bravenewcoin made a post about trusted timestamping, [here]( they describe the alternatives that existed in feb of this year. they are [blocksign]( [origin stamp]( and [proof of existence]( closer to a dollar). i also stumbled upon [btproof](

There’s an entire sub for talking about the current market value. posts belong there. The fact that this hasn’t been mentioned yet in the comments of this post is a sign that we’re in for a lot more noise really soon if we don’t get our shit together.
If you care about this sub being a good resource for bitcoin, call out these prepubescent babies, and tell them to take their lambo bullshit to the other subs. Downvote things you don’t want to see, and upvote the good things.
For now, I’ll stick around and fight to keep this place usable. If it ends up being a lost cause, then fuck all of you...you deserve the nightmare you’re creating

It's just such a mindless American-centric thing to do. Is that really the best use for $167,000 that people can come up with? A superbowl ad?
Please enlighten me, how would a superbowl ad help "widespread use and understanding"?? The world is learning about bitcoin just fine without a 2 second ad that just says "buy bitcoin".
If a bunch of uninformed NFL-loving get-rich-quick types of people jump on board, they're gonna be the first ones selling when the price dips too much. You think they would ever give a shit about scaling, or fungibility, or cross-chain interaction, or anything at all of any importance whatsoever? We have enough uninformed masses already at this point. 2017 has been a crazy year. I think we're good, thanks.
**What Bitcoin needs is informed participants who actually care about the longevity of the system, and don't just care about how much fiat their bitcoin is worth.**
Most people here that are pushing for wider adoption are motivated by the idea that the increased demand (along with a predictable supply) will cause the exchange rate to rise. That is *not* what should be motivating us if we want this experiment to last any serious amount of time. That's the kind of bullshit that fuels things like bitcoin cash...

I got on board almost 4 months ago. Found out I could be my own bank, which really appealed to me since I couldn't afford to keep my occasional non-steady income in a traditional bank account. Had a long wave of mania. I read so much, everything I could. So many thoughts and ideas began swirling around in my brain. I purchased my first bitcoin (around .21 for $50) over the counter through libertyX about a month ago. It seemed like the easiest way to get bitcoin without a bank account. I've since invested the .21 bitcoin into micro loans on BLC. Lending has gone mostly well. I plan on continuing lending on the site for at least a few months. I might purchase an entire bitcoin if the exchange rate goes down a little more.
So far, I'm enjoying figuring out this strange new world I've recently become a part of. I hope I can help other unbanked individuals get involved in bitcoin. Exciting times we live in, truly

It goes like this:
Presale to make a bunch of money, use money to actually make what you promised, mine profitably with it for the first few months (before public release), and then the main sale begins. Profit on profit on profit.
Consumers who bought early enough will mine profitability until more and more hash power accumulates and the difficulty rises. Now most are mining just enough to cover electricity costs. Then they hodl, limiting available supply, and the price goes up, so they can sell at a profit again. Meanwhile, the hardware company is still selling the same hardware to consumers that don’t realize that they’ll be mining at a loss for a while.
Until, of course, the next iteration of hardware. Rinse and repeat.

~~But there’s only one way to get ivory in the first place, and that’s by killing elephants~~. Wether you got it that way or not isn’t the point. The point is that ivory trade kills elephants, and criminalizing it slows the eventual extinction of wild elephants. If rhino horns were legal, rhinos would already be extinct. All of this for profit.
Now, I agree that acting in violence over possession is not the answer either, unless of course it is direct vigilante justice where a poacher kills an elephant for profit and the poacher subsequently gets shot and has their teeth removed
Edit - There’s more ways to get ivory than by killing elephants, like disease and old age. [However...](

If you send btc to a bch address, nothing will show up if:
* the coins had been moved since the August fork (which is very likely coming from the hot wallet of an exchange)
* if segwit is involved, since bch doesn’t use segwit
So, you send btc to a valid btc address, but the address was made from a bch wallet. Either nothing shows up in the wallet, or (if the coins haven’t moved since before August and the receiving address is valid for bch) what shows up is the amount of btc you think you bought, but instead of btc it’s bch, which is worth a lot less than btc.
The bch wallet will probably allow you to export the private keys so you could theoretically use the keys to access the money under the right circumstances.
Only problem is that we’re talking about people experiencing bitcoin for the first time. Someone new isn’t going to know what is going on, at all
Edit: supposedly the app creates a wallet for both btc and bch, not just bch. Haven’t confirmed this myself. Bitcoin(dot)com is still run by scammers who are trying to now compete with bitcoin. The site is full of misinformation and is peddled to the uninformed, so avoid them

You could add libertyX as a way to buy bitcoin with cash.
I don't have a bank account. Without a bank account, using this guide, I would eventually come to the conclusion that the only way to buy bitcoin is LBC. There is another way, and it's libertyX.
I bought my first $50 in bitcoin recently, using their service. It is an easy way to buy bitcoin over the counter. I think it would be a great addition to this great guide. You could let unbanked individuals know that there are a few ways to purchase bitcoin. (Another great way to get bitcoin is to earn it)
Unbanked individuals can buy bitcoin with cash through LBC *and* libertyX (and probably other ways I don't know about yet). **Would be great to have more options for the unbanked in your guide**.

Not impossible, just impractical for many, especially if you’re deeply tied to the old system. What incentives are there for someone who doesn’t worry about capital controls or who isn’t aware of (or affected much by) inflation?

Great site. I've been lending there for a little more than a month now. I started with about $50 worth of bitcoin, just to see how it works without risking too much money. So far, a couple late payments, but many more early payments. I'm expecting payments almost every day this month, because I split that 0.2-something bitcoin into many small loans. I plan on investing another $50 or so in the next few weeks. So far, I've been enjoying this site. I'm pleased with the returns so far. I might also try borrowing some time soon, once I get to know the system better. Thumbs up for BLC

The only reason bch has any value whatsoever is that it forked from Bitcoin, most people haven’t even figured out *how* to move their bch so it appears as if there are many hodlers, and the pump train is chugging along with roger conducting. When the network is actually used at the scale of Bitcoin, we’ll see how well bch really handles that much traffic, and how long it can sustain it, and if the enormity of the blockchain &amp; bandwidth required keeps most individuals from being able to run a full node

While I agree that there would still be ivory from natural elephant death, the fact remains that poaching and habitat destruction is what reduced populations of elephants to such low levels, not government policies (besides the obviously outrageous one you pointed out, as well as some others like it).
Maybe the answer is an ethical ivory market, where ivory isn’t sourced from poaching. Clean ivory could be tracked on a blockchain, if it could be added to the blockchain in a trustless way. That way you know where the ivory came from. The bigger the ethical market, the more it affects the price of unethical ivory. Seized and poached ivory can be tracked in the blockchain as well, and the markets could openly compete. Like you suggested, they could auction off the seized ivory and flood the market

first off, they could be a little more strict with the approval process. they might get less users, but they'll also get less defaults.
also, what if there was a small escrow fee or something like that? perhaps a fee payed by the lender, as insurance against future defaults. it would be a small fee, shared by all lenders in all loans. if a loan gets repaid, the fee stays in the community insurance fund. if a loan defaults, lenders can be compensated from the fund. it may not be 100% of funds lost, but would be *something*.
also, the site makes a cut from every loan. if they put a cut of the cut into the insurance fund, it would beef it up and make the insurance more effective. the site would, at first, make less income from the usual fees. however, it would put more trust in the site and attract more users (not to mention a more honest user base), therefore increasing traffic, increasing amount of loans, and increasing fee income in the long term. that would be nice.

Bitcoin got me into software/code. I’ve been on a multi-year journey now. Started with classes on edX. CS50 (from Harvard) and Intro to Computer Science with Python (from MIT) was a great start. There’s also appropriate math classes, cryptography classes, and even bitcoin and cryptocurrency classes, between edX, coursera, YouTube, etc. Also be sure to check out Andreas Antonopolis and Siraj Rival on YouTube. Great resources that are easily accessible
Best of luck on your journey!

I did too, more than 8 years ago, but the truth is, it *is* impractical for many. Bitcoin helps, but it doesn’t solve everything (at least not yet). Still lots of obstacles to tackle. Most parts of society are still heavily tied to the old system, and there is friction for those who try to live outside of the system. Just cashing a paycheck is a hassle (employers, give your employees the option to get paid in bitcoin! Better yet, pay them by the millisecond with LN/BTC!). Let’s keep chipping away at these obstacles so it will be easier for anyone to make that choice.

I’ve never been their customer ever, so probably none. I think that was an issue with customers who already had accounts.
Chase was the bank that forced me out of the system. The fee structures of my accounts changed around the time of the housing crisis/ economic recession. Chase had bought out Washington Mutual, which I had a free account with since I was a teenager (having opened a custodial account with a relative). As a customer of Chase, I was robbed of most of my savings, and would get overdraft charges on top of it all after they took every last penny.

I have no pension or any sort of retirement savings. I don’t even have a basic bank account. Bitcoin is the closest thing I have to a savings of any kind.
I tried to keep money in a traditional bank account, but the fee structure was unsustainable for my lifestyle. Since they’ve left me no options, I’ve gone to plan B.
To be honest, the bitcoin route actually seems more feasible, and I have more hope of saving for the future.
This is gonna be an interesting experiment..

@_date: 2017-04-14 09:18:42
Speaking for myself here... It is my understanding that raising the block size limit could only ever get you so much throughput. You couldn't raise it enough to scale Bitcoin to handle the amount that would be needed for mass adoption. Raising it is just kicking the can down the road, at the expense of full node operators. Less full nodes equals less decentralization equals bad for Bitcoin.
Now do you see why the fork would be contentious?
Real scaling needs to happen at some point. Scaling solutions are being actively developed and tested. A major improvement exists (one that fixes past problems while providing an effective block size increase) and is waiting to be activated, but the largest miner doesn't want to signal for it since it will break asicboost, affecting their profits. It's miners blocking technical solutions because of financial incentives to do so.
You say 95% consensus is stupid, but it's actually very conservative. **Bitcoin is hard to change**. That's a feature, not a bug. There's a lot of feels going around, swaying opinions this way and that way. If we went with less consensus, the vocal minority could rile up the hive mind so easily, and then we'd be fucked. I appreciate that you are seeking a technical solution, and hope that you aren't swayed by the feels.
TL;DR: damaging decentralization to appease miners is not the way most users want to scale. Some people don't think Bitcoin needs to be PayPal 2.0 right now. Changes happen slowly in Bitcoin. It's part of what makes it so resilient

I'm not saying that half the network is going to fall off the map overnight because of the change. I'm saying that the simple fact that increasing the block size increases the cost of running a full node. Some people think the network is too centralized and could use more nodes. Last I checked the number of nodes that can be found through the 21.co site was around 5000. Make node operating more expensive, yeah most of the nodes in developed countries will be fine, but what about the little guys on the fringes of the network? That dude running one of the only nodes for miles in Africa is gonna have some issues. There will be centralization. To what scale, we don't know for sure, but some people have a better idea than I do. Ask that Aussie guy if his bandwidth issues are being solved with a block size increase.

There's so many options out there. Look for wallets that value security, privacy, and ease of use, and look at what the community is saying about these wallets. Learn about what it means to be in control of your private keys. There's some links I can send you later, but I'm on my phone right now. Either way, a quick web and video search can teach you a tremendous amount (though "quick" is subjective, since it can become quite a rabbit hole, especially when just getting started with this kind of stuff)

Devs promised 2mb, and they delivered. Just not in the simpleton prefered method of doubling a variable value in the code. They engineered a solution that solves malleability while increasing effective block size to the promised capacity.

I've been having fun playing around with sensors lately, as there are a handful of available gpio pins on the 21 shield. im also trying to write a program that serves sensor data from remote raspberry pis on the 21 market for bitcoin. I say "trying" because I just started learning how to code last year. The 21 device is really fun. I learn new stuff every day.
there's way more intelligent and knowledgeable individuals doing cooler stuff with it though. Andreas antonopolis made a proof of concept of a way to share bandwidth for bitcoin using the 21bc. There's also people currently developing a github bounty system called Git Money.
It's not always even concepts that necessarily needed embedded mining to work, but they are concepts that do work well with embedded mining.

10 years working in horticulture. Most work experience is related to organic food production. I also have experience with nursery and greenhouse production, bulk propagation, hydroponics/aquaponics, landscaping, irrigation, as well as taking care of farm animals and bees. I’ve worked on small organic family farms, medium sized commercial organic crop producers, and have experienced large scale organic operations through field studies. I helped establish an organic farm plot at a community college, and was one of the first official employees (there was only 3 of us). I consulted for beginning farmers, helping establish multiple low key medical cannabis operations in California (indoor and outdoor, conventional and organic methods), and have helped conventional growers transition to organic. I’m currently working with a permaculture farm that grows food for a cafe, and hosts outdoor learning opportunities for children. I’m designing and planting a long term “food forest” project for them.
Horticulture is also a hobby of mine. At home, I grow a lot of my own food. I also like integrating electronics projects with garden projects. I’m currently working on a fun little project that involves a sensor network talking to a main brain that is monitoring the garden. For high value crops, like cannabis, you can justify spending more money to grow a better crop. Even with that in mind, the cost for stuff like this is getting cheaper all the time. $1.50 gets you a wireless micro controller that connects to sensors. The micro controller relays the data to a computer (could be as cheap as a piZero), where it is stored in a database. I’m planning to develop a nice interface for the main computer (touchscreen in the garden shed), along with a web interface (local wifi) for smartphone/tablet. I would also like to apply concepts of deep learning to the data. I can envision being able to make a predictive model for tasks like watering, one day. Also, making my own site-specific almanac would be cool

Everyone has a subjective opinion of what “low fees” means.
Besides, the whole system is supposed to eventually be incentivized *entirely* by transaction fees. Given that the majority of all coins that *will* exist have *already* come into existence over the last few years, it should not be surprising that we are witnessing the fee market emerge before our eyes.
How many halvenings should it take before fees become the primary source of income for miners?

An issue I foresee is digital copying. It’s easy to copy something digital.

It’s a nickname my friend randomly called me almost 15 years ago. It fell out of use for a few years, soon after she moved far away. About 8 or 9 years ago, I lived in a house with a bunch of people, and one day I ordered a free sample of coffee off of the web somewhere, using the nickname as a pseudonym. When it arrived, nobody knew who chabes was, but they happened to gearing up to play music on the local radio station and were out of coffee. I was working on a farm, and listened to them play on the radio that day. They thanked chabes for the coffee on air. When I got home, I told them about the nickname, and forgave them for drinking my coffee. Now most of the folks involved call me chabes.
I also forgive you for putting so much faith in Tone. Yes, he understands the basic patterns of money pushers, but bitcoin isn’t exactly like Wall Street. It probably will be much more like Wall Street some day, though

Exchanges have their own fees.
Transferring to your hw wallet will require a network fee (required if you want the transaction cleared in a reasonable amount of time. I haven’t heard of zero-fee transactions being cleared lately), unless the fee is paid for by the exchange you’re sending from.
Bitcoin network fees are set by the sender. If you buy from your boss, he has to pay a fee to send it.

I’m not the person you replied to, but I think what he means is that, more and more everyday, **people have an option when it comes to how they store and transfer their money**.
During the last big economic recession, the banks (even credit unions) adopted more aggressive fee structures, and got rid of things like free checking accounts. Low income individuals don’t make many purchases, and most of their transactions come from sending money to family members in another part of the world. One way that banks are setting themselves up for disaster is by pushing away individuals with low or unstable income, in favor of higher income individuals and institutions.
Furthermore, by refusing banking services to cannabis businesses, sex workers, and anyone else that the government has declared “bad”, they are forcing these groups (most of which deal in large amounts of cash) to seek alternatives.
Because the banks can’t (or won’t) serve the underserved, the underserved will inevitably seek other options. It’s just a matter of pressure and time. Things like bitcoin continue to widen the options and “even the playing field”. The more bitcoin can fill that gap, the quicker the downfall of the old way.

‘A South Korean official who guided Seoul’s regulatory clampdown on cryptocurrencies was found dead on Sunday, according to a government spokesman.
Jung Ki-joon, 52, was head of economic policy at the Office for Government Policy Coordination. He helped coordinate efforts to create new legislation aimed at suppressing cryptocurrency speculation and illicit activity, the spokesman.
Semiofficial news agency Yonhap reported that Mr. Jung was presumed to have suffered a heart attack and police had opened an investigation into the cause of death. Yonhap also reported that Mr. Jung was found at home. The government spokesman would only say that the Office for Government Policy Coordination wasn’t sure about the cause of death.
Mr. Jung’s colleagues said he had been under heavy stress in recent months as South Korea worked to tackle cryptocurrency speculation, Yonhap reported.
South Korea has been a hot spot for cryptocurrency trading and the threat of new legislation has weighed on the price of bitcoin this year following a manic rally in 2017.
Bitcoin recently traded at around $11,000, according to research site CoinDesk. It nearly reached $20,000 in December before global efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies gained steam. That prompted bitcoin, which is just one cryptocurrency, to lose as much as 70% of its value, falling to a low of just less than $6,000 earlier this month.
Still, bitcoin began 2017 at under $1,000. Investor enthusiasm in South Korea was one of the reasons prices soared so high in 2017. That concerned Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, who warned late last year that rising interest in cryptocurrencies could “lead to some serious distorted or pathological phenomenon.”
At a briefing last month, Mr. Jung said virtual currencies like bitcoin weren’t a form of legal currency and the government would “strongly respond to excessive cryptocurrency speculation and illegal activity.”
About 4.5% of all bitcoin transactions world-wide last year used the South Korean won, making it the most widely used fiat currency in bitcoin trading after the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and the euro, according to CryptoCompare. The South Korean won was also the second-most commonly used currency for trading some alternative cryptocurrencies, including ether and Bitcoin Cash, which is a bitcoin rival.
Bitcoin prices have also surged much higher in South Korea than other parts of the world, another example of the frenetic trading environment. At times in recent months, the price of bitcoin traded more than 50% higher in South Korea than in other countries, a phenomenon that traders called the “kimchi premium.”
That premium has all but disappeared as authorities have considered strict measures, including banning cryptocurrency trading on exchanges.
So far, South Korea has imposed more strict verification checks for cryptocurrency investors. They are now required to hold certified bank accounts to buy cryptocurrency using legal tender.’

It would be helpful to know where those transactions are coming from
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:36:30
A block is mined about every 10 min (on average), and the reward is currently 12.5 btc per mined block (plus transaction fees). When the reward is cut in half, the rate of mining blocks should remain around a 10 min average, but the payout for miners will only be 6.25 btc (plus transaction fees). This is an intentional limit on the creation of new bitcoin.
So, bitcoin won’t be mined faster. Less bitcoin will be mined with each 10 min block, so the rate itself (of newly mined bitcoin) actually gets cut in half.
Like said, 1800btc/day becomes 900btc/day

I don’t think you understand..
I don’t put *all* of my money in bitcoin. Not even close. I put money I want to save long term into bitcoin. This is left-over money, when all debts are payed. It’s my *savings*.. something I want to *save*.
I have regular dirty old paper money for day to day spending. The value of those dollars **declines** long term, because of inflation and monetary policies of people who don’t represent people like me. I want to *spend* that inflationary money that is consistently losing spending power, and *save* the deflationary money that works well as a safe long term store of value. So far, bitcoin is doing way better than alternatives, even precious metals. 
If I put $100 into my bitcoin savings in 2015, it’s purchasing power grew 100 times by the tail end of 2018.
I simply don’t have to think in terms of dollars anymore, since I’ve already gotten the dollar value out of my initial deposits. I’m still way up on the dollar value, either way. $11,000 is a lot more purchasing power than $200. Even if it dropped to $2000, I’d still have 10 times the purchasing power of the dollars I exchanged for bitcoin in 2015. Financial institutions just can’t give me rates anywhere near that.
Don’t be “concerned” about my understanding of how this works. I’m doing exponentially better than I have been doing under the old financial systems, because I have *more* control over my money than I did then.
Even if my savings (the exchange rate of my bitcoin) became less than the money I put in, I still have something more valuable: **financial sovereignty**. No one can tell me what I can or cannot do with my money. I don’t need to ask permission to send my money somewhere else.
On top of all of that, I can send my money to *anyone* in the world, much more quickly than a financial system would, for much cheaper, and no one can censor/delete/reverse/alter my transaction. Good luck achieving anything remotely close to that with a traditional financial institution.

- The maintainers have been involved for years (a fair amount of the developers got involved around 2011). You can see [here]( that some contribute more than others
- They gained the communities trust with their consistent contributions to the codebase, working for free when the value of bitcoin was minuscule
- The code is open source. You can compile it from source. Anyone who knows how to read code (it’s mostly c++) can verify the code is legit. [It’s there right now for you to look at]( [Here’s the code for miner.cpp](
- The software can be run on your own computer, though if you want to run the full stack and mine transactions as well, a normal computer wouldn’t be able to keep up. Specialized chips called ASICs (application specific integrated circuit) are used by miners to solve a specific computational problem (SHA256). Miners can combine their computational power together in what is called a mining pool.
- All users (not just miners) connect in a peer to peer way, like BitTorrent.

The money people want more money, so they bet on the future price of this special kind of money(bitcoin). The price of this special money is based on what people are willing to pay for it.
So, a bunch of the money people have bet on the future price going down. If there is a pattern on the money chart that looks like it’s going down and to the right, they will probably make more money on their bet. If the money chart looks like it’s going up, they need to have the special money, since it will be worth more regular money, and they need to pay for the regular money they are losing on the bet.
When enough of the special money gets bought, there won’t be as much special money as before, and money people will pay more regular money to get the special money. This change in “price” will affect the bets of the future price.

Actually "dirt rich" and "money poor". Dat soil tilth, doe..
Individuals who grow their own food and materials are free from the culture of haves and have-nots. This is especially true nowadays, with the internet available for much of the world. With seeds, water, and YouTube, they have the ability to provide almost all they need. They can even download blueprints for tractors, and run free and open source software, buy small electronics from china for pennies, download 3d models to print locally for pennies, crowdfund their greenhouse upgrade, ask another person about some insect they found in their fields. Access to the web changes everything.
I agree that my assertion that agriculture lessens the wealth distribution gap isn't exactly accurate. My current stance is that agriculture makes the wealth gap less effective at controlling the poor, which has not always been the case throughout the history of agriculture, but is currently the case.
No matter what sorts of freedoms technology provides, there's still incumbent power that will use their power to maintain or increase their power. Agriculture has been used against the poor many times.  See the internet/www for a more recent example of freedom enhancing technology that is having a power struggle with the masses and the incumbent power.

It’s actually really complicated.
Shortest version I could come up with:
There was a “civil war” and one side prevented the other side from scaling the way they saw fit. When the sides split, scaling proceeded once more. This caused a price spike, which attracted hoards of get-rich-quick types, which drove the price up tremendously.

Affiliates = 50%

Trading = y%
If x OR y are greater than zero, then 50% is most of his income.
The only case where half is not “most” is if he makes no money from his other know forms of income:

Actually there is a consistent rise in 1-2 sat range over the last **4 hours**

That's a difference of 1337 (not even kidding), or about 52% of the 2534 number from 4 hours ago
Btw, the price of BCH dumped hard compared to BTC a little more than, you guessed it... **4 hours ago**. Also happened to be around the time of [this post]( (which happens to be the 2nd most upvoted post currently on this sub)

$10 doesn’t pay for the overhead required to secure that amount of money.


No, my bitcoin amount stays the same. The exchange rate only matters when I want to *take from* my savings. I mostly try to *add to* my savings. Because the exchange rate was so ridiculously high around thanksgiving, I was able to buy Christmas gifts for a steal. This was coin I had picked up around $200/btc. $200 to $20,000 = 100x, so I was pretty stoked.

That's not the problem.

Posts about normal Bitcoin things are drops in a bucket these days. Some posts make it to the front page of the sub. Many good posts are just ignored when there's big price movements and 90% of submissions are about how much the exchange rate jumped or tumbled. This is fucking bitcoin!

I’ve used it as a savings for almost 3 years now. It’s actually allowed me to save anything at all.
I used to have a bank account that would charge $10usd/month because I didn’t have enough money in savings. How could I ever have enough money in savings if they tax me for being too poor??
I closed my account in 2011, but didn’t find out about bitcoin until 2015. I lived on cash. There was no way to safely save the little money I earned, until I found out about bitcoin. Now I have a small savings, which is something I simply could not feasibly achieve before bitcoin.

If there was an actual chain split (as opposed to a fork), the price would tank. Most miners didn’t have enough profit margins to withstand a long bear market. Bitmain and friends probably had/have the biggest profit margins, thus could hold out on activating segwit longer. UASF being implemented would have been devastating to miners, so they went with the alternative: activation of segwit. It was made much more attractive to miners by including the 2mb upgrade

Fair enough.
The way I see it is that there’s just way more people working on the post-segwit side of things. That includes all types of people: from math nerds and cryptographers, to participants of traditional financial institutions and people in it to get rich, from immature adults and literal children, to idealistic cypherpunk elders and child geniuses.
The other side has far fewer participants, so the bad ones stand out like a fart in a small room. In fact, most of them are just spraying feces everywhere in this small room. Many intelligent members of the community checked out for the censorship resistance, but then went back to bitcoin when it became clear that the purpose was not to fight censorship, but to fight bitcoin itself. It’s a dismal place, these days, unless the price of bitcoin is plummeting.
With the enormous price rise last year, even this sub has been diluted with noise of price talk and tribalist drama (I myself have even been guilty of the latter). 
Bottom line is **most of the really intelligent people in bitcoin are busy theorizing, coding, testing, and building**. The folks who are on social media all the time are heard more, but actually contribute way less. Something to keep in mind.

Python is a great intro to coding. Check out edX, which is a platform for free online classes (with options for paid certificates). I’d recommend Harvard’s CS50 intro to computer science, and the MIT intro to computer science using python classes.
CS50 covers introductions into different kinds of coding: scratch (coding designed for kids), C (lower level, powerful, but has a slight learning curve, seemingly redundant syntax), python (easy, straightforward, good transition to web development). The rest of the class goes into web development using python, html, sql, java script, etc. I think it’s a great place to start.
The MIT class goes deeper into python. Very helpful for getting to the next level and beyond. They’re both extremely valuable resources, yet are free to anyone who has access to the internet

You can zoom into the last few months on that chart. Look at the inorganic bubble before segwit activation. Spammers giving it one last go to try and block segwit. Then look at the chart after segwit. This is where we are now, and most exchanges aren’t even using segwit yet.


You don’t have to


No. 90%+ isn’t even close to the support of sw2x. Hashpower signaling is all that is close to 90%, and doesn’t mean anything. Miners will mine the chain that is most valuable, regardless of their signaling.
Miners on the BCH chain still signal NYA, so it’s obvious where their intentions lie. Bitmain wants to keep using ASICboost, and would rather split the community than adapt to the ways that Bitcoin is evolving. Too much short term thinking on their part.

This is one of the reasons why bitcoin will do well in the long term. As people accumulate wealth they made through taking risk (rather than through labor), when they come up hard (like many did in 2017), there is a feeling of wanting to give back to this thing that has already given so much. People who are into bitcoin give back to projects and people they believe in. That’s how we get relay networks, satellites, legal assistance, as well as support for projects and web services, like Wikileaks, internet archive, MAPS, letsEncrypt, etc. It’s such a beautiful thing.

Increased bandwidth requirements for full nodes is a result of increasing the block size. Increasing bandwidth requirements makes it impossible for some node operators to continue running their nodes.

They won’t be the same price. Price is based on buy and sell orders on exchanges. If one has a majority of the market on its side, it could be worth more, and the minority chain would be worth less. If it’s contentious (closer to 50/50), the price of both will probably be less than the initial pre-forked bitcoin.

Transaction fees were high in December, when the network was dealing with an enormous increase in users. You pay a higher fee to be included in a block sooner. The lowest fees getting cleared went up to a ridiculous amount, never seen before by the network.
Here’s how that works: The computers involved in securing the network (miners) get the fees for including transactions in blocks of transactions. Each transaction takes up a certain amount of data (bits of binary data) and only so much data (transactions) can fit in each block. When blocks are full, a fee market emerges and there is competition for block space. Miners are financially incentivized to include the highest fee transactions first, thereby leaving the lowest fees to remain in limbo until block space clears up again.
This incentivizes:
- users to reduce the size of their inputs
- developers to improve scalability
- the uninformed get-rich-quick types to migrate to other networks (networks that haven’t gotten big enough to need to scale bigger)
Code is open source. You can see it all, as well as changes, who's participating/contributing, and it’s entire history, on the [bitcoin GitHub repository]( Competent (and some incompetent) developers can contribute without permission, however only the maintainers of the repository get the final say of what gets merged. The whole thing is public, so if the maintainers were obviously discriminating against certain devs, the open community would shit a brick. It is the maintainer’s prerogative to decide what gets merged, but it is a public process.

@_date: 2018-02-23 17:27:55
Well, here’s my perspective:
In 2015, he was hardly coding(see GitHub), but doing talks and conferences(see YouTube). I remember watching [a talk in 2015 with both Gavin and Mike]( and I thought they were celebrities (too cool for school Mike, sipping a beer). I didn’t realize that the main people doing the work in the background were not giving talks so much, but were busy actually coding solutions to future issues.
When Gavin started making a fuss over block size(see his blog posts), a lot of people gave him a hard time, because his solution was to “kick the can down the road” by simply increasing the block size. He even admitted that his solution just put off actually solving the issue by outsourcing it to future developers, but argued that we have to kick the can or else we’d lose our chance of mass adoption if blocks got full.
There was lots of disagreement about the best way forward. Gavin and Mike went forward with writing new bitcoin software (XT). This is software that would have potentially changed the rules of Bitcoin. The software needed consensus to become Bitcoin. When it was obvious that there was no consensus, Mike full on had a rage quit, and Gavin kind of stepped back out of the spotlight, where he continues to contribute to discussion (or is just a troll at this point, depending on how you look at it). He seems to support every attempt to break bitcoin.
Then there was the CSW debacle..
When Craig Wright came out claiming to be satoshi, Gavin (who coresponded with satoshi in the early days) offered to get to the bottom of things. When presented with Craig’s “evidence”, Gavin told the world that he believed that Craig was the real satoshi.
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, or, at the very least, cryptographic verification (something the real satoshi should easily be able to provide). Supposedly, Craig signed a message with a key belonging to satoshi (possibly from the very first mined bitcoin block), and Gavin said case closed. When the rest of the community wanted public cryptographic verification, and didn’t get any, the community cried foul.
In the world of cryptography, you don’t need a theatrical “proof” on TV with some “authority” telling you what to believe (this actually happened on the BBC). You just need to show that you possess a private key by signing a message with said key. The fact that he couldn’t do that publicly came back to bite Gavin’s credibility in the ass. Especially when [this]( happened.
Now that time has passed, Gavin said he might have been “bamboozled” by Craig, yet still supports everything he does (BU, BCH, etc). Craig said he doesn’t want fame and money and to be in front of a camera, yet that is *exactly* what he has done in the last year. The guy is not the soft-spoken gentle satoshi that Gavin says he is. He’s an obnoxious money-grubbing charlatan who talks people down and yells at entire crowds of people. On top of that, the guy is [balls deep with the biggest scammers]( in the space. Anyone who still believes he’s satoshi needs to show us the evidence or get their head checked.
With the evidence laid out for everyone to see, Gavin has lost all remains of his credibility (for many, his credibility was in question the moment he got involved with the CIA), and receded to be a troll on twitter. Who knows what he’ll get behind next.

For a little context: miners are driven by financial incentives. Their greed is actually a requirement of the system to maintain robust security. It should come as no surprise that miners stalled the activation of segwit for as long as they did, and that the system would have to move forward with the participation of the users. Good thing there was a test like this so early in Bitcoin’s history. Many users will not forget

I bought $50 worth in 2015 when it was around $220/230. Wasn’t looking to make a profit. Just completely amazed by this fascinating technology. Also I didn’t have a bank account for a few years, so the idea of being in control of my own financial services was (and still is) very interesting to me. I now have a savings account without needing a bank, which is pretty liberating

Oh, but those fees...
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:33:52


Have you been paying attention at all since segwit has been activated? This is no longer true.
Plus the reason blocks were full before and fees were high was because of spammers (quite possibly miners) sending dust transactions to themselves. Now there’s less spam, but some miners still mine almost empty blocks, which adds to fee pressure.
If we want bitcoin adoption, we need miners to work *for* bitcoin, not against it. We need exchanges that use segwit. We need users who prefer and support businesses that are working toward a better bitcoin.
I believe more old hands will flee from corporate takeover than from clunky bitcoin. They’re old hands! They’ve been involved since it was more clunky, not less.
You said yourself:


So, instead, let’s work together on finding and creating better long term solutions, instead of relying on the 3rd parties that bitcoin was designed to circumvent.

Cool story, bro. If exchanges actually used segwit, the entire fee market would be reduced. If you care so much about low/zero-fee transactions, maybe you should petition exchanges to be a part of this community and actually participate in scaling instead of relying on fees to capitalize on the community.

I imagine, since the blackouts are so common, that they are expected, inevitably. Is there a certain time of the day that they are more common or expected? Or is power just constantly going out and coming back a few hours later, on a seemingly random time scale?
When there are blackouts, since there is so much reliance on debit/credit, do people just not make purchases during that time? Or do people turn to cash at those times instead?

Bitcoin sells itself. Always has, even in bear markets. **It’s not a product. It’s a technology.** Build the technology and the rest will follow.
The things we need to do to make bitcoin more accessible are improve privacy, fungiblility, and decentralization. The way forward is to build a strong routing layer, which is what is currently being developed with lightning. New wallets and services using lightning will make it so you don’t even know you’re using bitcoin. It’s what makes everything work in the background, but the user has a nice, simple, and easy to use interface.
Instead of coming at the issue from an American capitalist perspective, try to think beyond ideology, and image this from a technology standpoint. It’s the wallets that use the decimals. What needs to be changed is the option to use satoshis *in the wallet software*. Existing wallets could implement this now, and new wallets could be made to include this feature. Ain’t nothing to it but to do it, as they say.

As silly as it seems, bitcoin,com is an anti-bitcoin scam site.

Via is under the control of Bitmain. I wouldn’t recommend sending them any more money if you care about bitcoin. They would rather jump between blockchains, mine BCH at a low difficulty, and jump back to BTC when the difficulty readjusts. They’re priority is personal profit before all else. Might be an opportunity to make some short term returns, but the fact is that **your money is being used to attack bitcoin**.
Just buy and hodl, or earn and hodl. Spend when it makes sense to, but remember.. **we vote with our money**. This ecosystem is extremely young and impressionable. What we do absolutely makes a difference. Spend wisely

Time frame is significantly off.
In August of 2017, the sw2x/blocksize debate resulted in SW on bitcoin and the bcash fork. There’s nothing like that happening right now.
September was a big month, because it was becoming clear that the governance issue was solving itself. The minority of loud propagandists got their minority fork, and bitcoin got segwit. Work was underway on new developments that require segwit, like LN and schnorr sigs.
Big hype back then. I doubt we’ll see that this fall. Kim Kardashian just posted something about bitcoin, which (to me) implies that bitcoin is currently oversold and the market needs longer to correct. Like when stock traders were getting trading advice from their cab drivers and shoe shiners leading up to the stock market crash of 1929

Luke is a fundamentalist Catholic. Dude thinks men should be able to force women to birth a child, no matter what.. (anti-choice libertarianism at its finest). Not sure how he feels about sexual abuse allegations that keep coming up in the Catholic Church..
Luke gets it, when it comes to some things. He definitely has some fucked up ideas as well. Stick around long enough, and you’ll see the crazy come out.
Unfortunately, he blocked me on twitter last week because he didn’t want to hear anymore of my blathering about historical Christian anti-semitism.

Was doing alright experimenting with BLC. Then they changed some major rules without any warning to users. The number of loans that could be active was reduced to 1 for newer accounts &amp; 2 for higher reputation accounts. This is great in the long run, but, because they enacted the new rules without any prior notice, many borrowers with too many loans started disappearing when their loans couldn't be replenished. If there was fair warning, they would have a chance to climb down off the ladder a little more gently. I'm glad the ability to stack loans has been reduced. I just wish the site admins announced rule changes before they're implemented. They really screwed over a lot of loyal lenders, and seem to not really care.

[really?]( How do you figure?


Unfortunately, this sets the precedent that businesses can decide governance of Bitcoin. This is unacceptable for a system that doesn’t rely on third parties for it’s governance. It’s not how Bitcoin works, and if it happens, it means Bitcoin has failed to live up to it’s claim of censorship resistance and immutability.

You can spend bitcoin on amazon.com items (in a slightly roundabout kind of way). You put some bitcoin into basically a software-enforced escrow that is released when you tell the site that you received your order. I’ve bought a few things here and there. My last purchase was a nice insulated water bottle and a raspberry pi.
You can also buy bitcoin there by purchasing someone else’s order on amazon.com.

If namecheap had been holding bitcoin as long as they have been accepting bitcoin for payments (they were in 2015), they would have *more* profit from the value of their bitcoin than the value of the USD they converted to (without even considering USD inflation).
Guess what.. They also accept other kinds of payments. It’s not like they’d stop getting dollars for most of their transactions. For businesses that accept bitcoin, bitcoin purchases are such a small fraction of their sales, it should hardly make a difference wether they convert to USD or not

True. I should have said “almost nothing”. How many of those alts share some of their blockchain with Bitcoin? Bcash, Bgold, etc. all benefited from the pre-fork market cap, making it appear as if they had a high market cap. It just makes the idea of a market cap look so ridiculous, but it also shows how “value” was created out of thin air.
Sure, other coins could come along with a huge 21 trillion coin premine or whatever and can get their shitcoin listed on poloniex and sell 100 for a dollar and now they have a 210 billion dollar market cap. But that only creates new money out of nothing for the recipients of the premine.
Forks, on the other hand, create money for previous holders. That means rich get richer, and barriers to entry for the non-holders begin to grow. Large holders can sell shitforks, and buy more bitcoin, increasing demand while absorbing supply, driving up the price. People can still buy fractions of a bitcoin, but their purchasing power shifts with the exchange rate.

Absolutely untrue. No other network has been tested the way bitcoin has. Show me another “coin” that maintains its core values at scale. Eth can’t even decide which loss of funds to erase or not.
Instead of thinking of it as an app, try thinking of it as a new kind of internet. Bitcoin is a protocol and a network, not a web browser. Why people feel the need to repeat this BS is beyond me.

I’m sure some folks here would pay for a service like that, but I’m not one of them. Nothing against you. Mining is just not what I’m looking to currently spend money on.
On one hand, I live in a rural community, and our internet sucks out here. If I wanted to seriously get into mining, sure, I would probably look into remote hosting.
On the other hand, the only thing that makes me want to mine right now is the fact that there’s finally a competitor to Bitmain’s hardware monopoly (halong). Other than that, I have little interest in adding more risk to my already risky investments

That sounds like the kind of misinformation that gets thrown around on that sub. I asked for facts. is not a place for factual information.
This article that was on the front page of this sub today explains the roadmap for scaling that Adam Back (a Blockstream employee and dev) supports : 
Clearly says he seeks to increase the block size limit through a hardfork. These devs aren't opposed to hard forks, just *contentious* hard forks 
Btw, some core contributors are Blockstream employees. However core and Blockstream are not the same thing. I think you might be a bit confused.

Show me where I can get a pi for $35, barebones, in the United States, because I've looked. It's gonna end up being more like $40, and you still need mining hardware, the blockchain (see how long that takes to download on a pi), and even a power cord. Yes, you can spend your time and effort making a 21 clone for way cheaper, but not everyone wants to do that, or even has time to figure out how to.
It's great that you can install 21incs software on a regular pi. I'm sure there will be people doing great things on either platform. I don't get why you care so much that people are spending their own money on things they find value in. Whatevs. Thanks for sharing! I'm super excited to see what people do with both the 21 computer *and* the raspberry pi. It's so wonderful that people have a choice, and that more alternatives are popping up all the time.

I imagine if there's a bunch of these tiny low-power devices running in homes and offices around the world, it would make quite a mining pool.

Maybe talk to the main electrum devs before going public? The bitcoin community generally trusts what Thomas Voegtlin and friends are releasing. Work *with* people, like a good open source fork would. You’ll get a much better community response if you avoid the fishy behavior, like quietly scooping up electrum(dot)com, which is supposedly a pricey domain, without any sort of community engagement/involvement. People involved with bitcoin are digital targets, and have to constantly maintain a level of skepticism and adversarial thinking

the fiat spent on the bitcoin was less than $100. They got a $100 drill set for less than $100. they probably also learned about hodling.
Just because a come up could have been increased with patience doesn't suck for him. He used his money. Hodling is useless until the currency is actually used. If he was smart, he didn't spend all his bits on one drill set. How hard is it to stash a few bitcoin when you can get them for less than $100?
IMO, currency should be used as savings and spending. Doesn't need to be one or the other.
I was happy to spend bitcoin on a raspberry pi two years ago when the price was in the $200s. I was able to purchase something online without a bank account. Now I've been using the pi for a while and have gotten much more than my money's worth.
If bitcoin moons, I still have bitcoin. If it never moons, I have already gotten something that is worth more than I originally spent. It doesn't suck. It's win win.

Not necessary. They are hardly supporting bitcoin by accepting it and immediately converting to USD. Yes, it offers hodlers another place to spend their bitcoin.

It only takes that long when the size of each block isn't enough to clear the queue of unconfirmed transactions, like when the network is being spammed and has more volume than it can currently handle, and like it will do on a regular basis as more users start to use Bitcoin, hence wanting and needing bigger block sizes. If transactions happen faster, the network could still outgrow the faster pace through further adoption, hitting a wall like this again, all the while sacrificing network security for speed. Block size has to be changed at some point

As for the mempool, all I could find was evidence of blocks with many small transactions being sent to single addresses during mempool foooding. It would be impossible to prove wether it's legitimate or spam. It's just odd that the times when the mempool has been empty, these transactions aren't present. It's also odd that the mempool flooding stopped after segwit2x became more widely accepted as the way to stick to the HKA. How can the most flooded mempool in all of Bitcoin's history go from being pumped full to going back to how it used to be in such a short period of time? I wish there was a way to solidly prove this, but it's impossible without miners confirming it themselves. Maybe the best I could do is to show what the "stress tests" of 2015-2016 look like as reflected in the mempool.
Either way, if someone wanted to spam the network to make it look like the blocksize limit needs to be raised, it wouldn't require much money to throw away. The fact that it is so accessible to anyone with a few bitcoin is a problem. I'm legitimately curious... what makes you think spam like that isn't happening?

I still don't see why it's ok to exclude people outside of metropolitan hubs just because you think raspberry pis shouldn't be able to run full nodes. I get that running a full node on hardware from the 80s is kind of silly. However, running a full node on hardware from today is not. It seems I'm not going to convince you. We have obvious ideological differences. That's fine. I'm just not trying to be a part of PayPal 2.0, where someone else is running the software and hardware for me. I'm trying to be a part of a system of open, decentralized, peer to peer value transfer. I'm not sure why youd say that Bitcoin has failed since you can't run it on your machine from the 80s. That's definitely not what I was implying. So far, Bitcoin has trucked on in the face of xt, classic, and BU, since it is so resistant to change. If y'all want big blocks and centralized data centers for full nodes, fork already. That's the beauty of open systems like this.

Pieter, Matt, and Christian work for Blockstream. Blockstream is a company founded by cypherpunks to develop Bitcoin. They have a defensive patent strategy to protect the space from patent trolls. Everything they do is to make Bitcoin the best it can possibly be.
Companies like bloq are antithetical to Bitcoin. Why trust them over a company like Blockstream? Cypherpunk ideology vs. working with law enforcement for profit. That's what it really boils down to.
The fact that there are so many people here opening their buttholes for companies like bloq is indicative of all of the new blood lately. If you only care about the exchange rate, you're probably fine with KYCcoin. Fuck that. That's not Bitcoin.

ETC can only indicate so much. It's quite different, if you think about it.
The whole thing with ETH was that "code is law" but that changed during the DAO debacle. When a handful of the community decided that the rest of the community should allow a mulligan for vulnerable code that so many people put their money into. That made "code is law" meaningless. Ethereum proved to be mutable and centralized.
A handful of the community, that doesn't care about market cap as much as they care about immutability and decentralization, decided to stick to "code is law". Hence eth classic.
There have been multiple Ethereum hacks lately that weren't big enough to try to mulligan out of again. Precedent was established with the DAO hardfork, but the line is being drawn as to the threshold of what is reasonable to hardfork over.
The hardfork that is coming to Bitcoin has nothing to do with people losing money from a failed smart contract.
Also, if you think there is no downside to a split like this, I wouldn't be so sure. Ethereum had *so much* momentum last year. We all had such high hopes for them. Now they have so much greedy speculation money and clueless businesspeople, the interesting technological developments are hidden amongst the noise of scammy ICO bullshit. It's quite depressing to watch. Especially when a lot of the mindless money-driven Wall Street bullshit ends up here too

Speaking for myself here... Of the bitcoiners ive met, there's usually people who've only been aware of Bitcoin for a short time and think it's a way to accumulate lots of money, and there's people who have been aware of it for years who are more fascinated by the technology and the potential for innovation. The former don't run software. The latter do.

I think you're confusing "segwit network" with segwit + lightning network. Lightning networks are like proof of stake sidechains that settle on the Bitcoin main chain.

Actual "use" for bitcoin?? How about financial sovereignty? I'm my own bank. I am in control of my transactions in a global decentralized network of peers.
It's not about investing. The price rise is a product of this kind of thinking. Yes, speculation. The actual "value" that bitcoin has is allowing anyone to have the right to financial sovereignty.

Nothing is free. The split will cause further market volatility and uncertainty. The value of bitcoin could tank pretty hard for a while, depending on how it all unfolds.
As long as your bitcoin are split correctly (safe from replay), there isn't much to worry about on your end. Though, there is the possibility that BCC goes to zero very quickly. In that case, you want to sell asap. Don't wanna be left hodling the wrong bag.

I do. Good luck.
When I was 18, I had a checking and savings account from Washington Mutual (a bank that got bought by JP Morgan Chase during the early days of the housing crisis). I was so excited to get a few cents back in interest earned. When they were Chase bank, the formerly free checking was no longer free. I had to have a certain amount of money in my accounts, or else I would be charged $10 a month. They did this without warning me (it was in the finest of fine print in word barf on a tiny pamphlet), so my savings got drained by criminal bankers, $10 each month. Eventually I closed my account, because they obviously don't want to be a bank for poor people. I was without any kind of financial services for a while before finding out I could be my own bank with bitcoin. I still don't have the ease of using a card, but at least I don't have to rely on cash under the mattress for every single transaction. I tend to take the road less traveled by and make it work for me. It's not easy, but in the end, I'm better off than when I started.
My advice to you... if you have a bank account, use it to get bitcoin. If I could afford it, I'd still have a bank account, solely for the purpose of buying bitcoin. Be careful about doing illegal stuff while you have a bank account. Your identity is associated with your purchases.
Also, don't get so fixated on the exchange rate of bitcoin. It will rise and fall. Bitcoin is not about wealth accumulation (though it could be an extra bonus, on top of what bitcoin offers). Educate yourself about the underlying technology. It has the real value. Financial sovereignty will be more and more important in this ever changing world we live in. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

I used to share a room with two other people. One night person A comes home fucked up on god knows what and proceeds to drop trou and start relieving themselves between my bed and person B's bed. When I got up and yelled at him, he was so fucked up that he couldnt understand my words. He let out this descending awkward chuckle that faded into incoherent babbling. I came to the conclusion that he was not in a state to be reasoned with, so I went to sleep elsewhere. The next day, I wanted to give him shit for being such a fuck up, but he felt like such a piece of shit that I didn't have to do anything. I even had the thought of attempting to make him feel less like a shitty dick, but I though, nah. He made his bed, now he has to sleep in it. Such is the nature of sharing space with others to save on rent. You get what you pay for

Drop in hashrate leading up to difficulty retarget, rise started just before difficulty dropped slightly, now difficulty is lower and more hashpower is mining. Next retarget is still a ways off.
If I had my tinfoil hat on, I'd guess that some large producer(s) of hashpower (Bitmain?) made some sort of deal with multiple pools... we'll give you mining hardware if you run the software we say, signal the way we say, and do what we say. You pay electricity, you keep the coin, just be our puppet when we need you, so the whole thing looks decentralized. This is obviously just speculation, as I have zero proof of any of this. Sure seems plausible, though, and that is a little concerning.

Maybe when the big blockers have their own coin, there won't be as much push to raise the block limit yet. With segwit activated, second layers emerging, other scaling solutions implemented, and no one artificially filling blocks with spam, the need for a block size increase might be years away still.
If the big blockers have a successful alternative chain, the amount of people pushing for a block size increase would be decreased, theoretically. If bcash crashes and burns like XT, classic, BU, etc., you can expect to see the same people trying to raise the block size limit, again and again and again

From what I understand, it's not about legal enforceability so much. A smart contract executes programmatically depending on the outcome. If all parties abide by the contract, then some result is programmatically enforced. If one or both parties breach the contract, a different result is programmatically enforced. Why even bring it to court? No lawyer or judge is needed to execute the code.
On the other hand, lawyers and judges might be involved in smart contract *creation*. This is where the world of a contract lawyer would intersect with the world of smart contracts. However, not all smart contracts will be integrated with the legal world. Smart contracts will allow individuals to come up with their own contracts, outside of the world of law. The code is enforcing the contract, so you don't need a legal system to enforce anything. The code *is* the legal system. No court necessary.

It's probably better that speculative investors move to other cryptocurrencies so that core developers can focus on utility. I'm personally sick of seeing all of the posts about price fluctuations and greedy bs that adds no value to bitcoin (other than exchange rate value).
Getting more people to use bitcoin and having a high exchange rate should come later, after the groundwork has been laid down. Solve the privacy and fungibility issues, solve the scaling issues, and then the world can adopt bitcoin. That's why I disagree so strongly with Roger Ver's position of adoption first, all else later. The world is only so ready for bitcoin, and bitcoin is only so ready for the world.
Great thing is that the groundwork is currently being laid down. Many passionate and intelligent developers are collaborating to improve and scale bitcoin. We get to have front row seats while bitcoin grows into the internet of money, and the underlying technology becomes integrated into humanity. I could care less about exchange rate or market dominance

There are more reasons than ever to run your own web server nowadays. The web is in need of serious redecentralization. Why would people like Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the web) fight for fixing the recentralization of the web if it wasn't broken and being co-opted by mega corporations? Walled gardens, wide disregard for privacy of users, government backdoors, censorship. If that's what decentralization looks like, then wtf.
If you think that lifting the block size limit will lead to more decentralization, you're severely mistaken.
I dunno, maybe you're ok with centralized things. Facebook, Reddit, and twitter might be your go-to sites for experiencing the web. That's fine. Like you said, people might have a different vision than you.
I think you're right about the fact that a fork is coming. This division over block size and appropriate scaling has severely polarized the community. The extreme divisiveness is exactly what enemies of Bitcoin want. Probably better that it happens now than years down the line. I believe that Bitcoin can survive this. There's just too many people with lots of money involved to just let it go to shit. We'll see what happens, though. Humans have a great track record for fucking things up

No need to freak out. The bitcoin haven't moved from your first address. As long as you have the correct seed, you can access your keys.
Also, as far as I'm aware, breadwallet is a free app. You're not a paying customer, and they don't have to be waiting by the phone, so to speak, taking care of customer service issues. Coinbase seems to have similar customer service, and they make gobs of money off of their customers.
If you feel like you're not getting anywhere and still need help figuring this out, drop me a private message with screenshots. I haven't used breadwallet in a while, but I use a clone for dogecoin called doughwallet (or just dough). I can try to at least lead you in the right direction.

You can maybe have a script check for corruption as it happens (the timing might be a clue as to why it’s happening in the first place), and then does something in response (auto reindex or whatever).
Pi 3B+ models use more power than previous models. I’d check for undervoltage.

I agree that the media fuels misinformation/infotainment and that the much of the responsibility lies with them. Still doesn't excuse the responsibility of voters to know what they are voting on. I don't think idiots shouldn't be able to vote..I never said anything of the sort. And I agree that the institutions responsible for informing the public need to step up and meet their responsibilities. Maybe part of the problem is that people get their information from news outlets. When your local Fox11 news is telling you that Trump is a strong leader who's domestic and foreign policies are making the country/world safer from the rise of terrorism, most people won't see that and think it's propaganda. Most people won't stop and reflect on the foreign policies of the country that have been directly fueling the conflicts and terrorism. You're right, that is a problem with these institutions. So why shouldn't I point out that people are blindly following misinformation?

Diet pi is a nice headless distro that will run on your pi. It has a large suite of software that can be chosen and installed through a config process (like raspi-config on raspbian). You only install what you want. If you want a desktop environment, you can add (or remove) one at your leisure.
There are also other single board computers that run Linux distros.
LattePanda Alpha is on the higher end, having an intel (quad core i7) cpu &amp; intel gpu, more ram, built in emmc storage, usb 3, gb ethernet, m.2 port (that can take an NVMe drive), and more. I run Ubuntu currently, but I’ve gotten it to run many current distros, including Linux Mint, QubesOS, CentOS, Debian, ElementaryOS, and a few others (It also runs Windows 10 and MacOS, dual or single boot, if you’re into that sort of thing). It’s definitely overkill for a headless node (I use mine for machine learning and for 3d modeling/slicing/printing), but if you have the money, it’s fast as hell. Usual tasks like apt-get update and upgrade take way less time than they do on a pi. Booting from NVMe takes seconds.
On the (relatively) cheaper end, check out Orange Pi (they came out with a few new boards recently), Odroid (the original sbc that had a pi form factor, but higher specs. Now has an array of models), Libre Computer boards (open platform, no licenses), Pine64 boards (like pi, but higher specs), Asus Tinker board (pi form factor, higher specs). There’s also a few others that are eluding my memory.
Most of these run some sort of Linux. Many run Debian, Ubuntu, or a lighter flavor like Lubuntu.

If that's how the ecosystem grows, why is that a bad thing? There should be competition to some degree. The users can decide what is best for them individually.
Speaking to the person who spammed this thread originally with FUD and then deleted all of their posts: I personally don't use Facebook or myspace or the many similar things that came before them, like Friendster and livejournal. That analogy has never struck a chord with me.
Back to the person I was originally replying to.. If eth surpasses the market cap of btc, who cares? Devs will still work on both, because they're both unique enough to be apples to oranges. One is intentionally simple and, if scaled in a smart, safe, and effective way, will be the standard protocol for value transfer layer on the internet, joining the other suite of protocols, like tcp/ip, ftp, https, etc. The other one (eth) is intentionally more complex, and is not trying to be the value transfer layer of the internet, but rather it is trying to be a global computer of (mostly)immutable code.
If Bitcoin can't solve the issue of this miner blockade, it should be replaced by something that does. Sorry if that doesn't fit people's short term narrative.
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:40:45
I think the last one I replied to was a direct message. I'll copy my reply here:
You're correct in thinking that segwit and block size increase alone are not enough to properly scale the network. One of the reasons why segwit has so much support is that it paves the way for future scaling. Segwit allows the consolidation of the opening and closing of bi-directional channels. It also permanently solves 3rd party and scriptsig malleability, making 2nd layer solutions less complicated to implement and more efficient, as well as allowing lightweight Layer 2 clients that trustlessly monitor the blockchain, removing the need for Lightning channel nodes to be full Layer 1 nodes as well. Without tx malleability, smart contracts will be easier and safer to implement.
One of the reasons why Bitmain is opposed to the development roadmap proposed by core developers is that they (Bitmain) are currently relying on Layer 1 for their returns, and have refused to become involved in Layer 2 solutions. Bitmain actually makes more money when blocks (in general) are full, so they are incentivized to keep the pressure on (though they have been known to mine empty blocks when they find one quickly, which rewards them with the block reward and no fees, but also adds to the fee pressure). If we get segwit, It won't be long before we get a few Layer 2 options. Soon, Layer 2 will be accessible to the masses, and many transactions will take place off chain. Layer 2 can keep scaling, without affecting Layer 1 block size.
Bitmain can (and will) profit from and monopolize Layer 2 when it is in use, but for now, they get their paychecks from milking, monopolizing, and having an unfair advantage (asicboost) over Layer 1. Activating segwit also means less transaction fees, right off the bat. It's the incentivized nature of the game, so I don't blame Bitmain for being so greedy, but too much centralized political and monetary power is one of the problems that Bitcoin is supposed to be solving.
Aside from Layer 2 and segwit, the roadmap for scaling also includes the change from the ECDSA to the Schnorr signature algorithm, which allows signature aggregation, thus reducing signature data from each block. Another future improvement is compact fraud proofs, that will make violations of the system verifiable with proofs that are compact and easily used by SPV clients.
So, if you look at the bigger picture, segwit is an important part of the path forward for Bitcoin. Core developers have incentive to make Bitcoin the best it can be. Miners have financial incentive to game the system as best they can. Everyone is trying to operate in their best interests.

What happened was a couple years ago, Gavin sounded the alarm on blocks filling up, was pushing for raising the block size, most devs other than Mike Hearn had issues with the way Gavin wanted the scaling to go, there was a lot of debate here and elsewhere, two major camps emerged (on chain scaling/big block/more users now vs. second layer scaling/small blocks/scaling for the long term/decentralization now), there were lots of posts on about Gavin and Mike's implementation of Bitcoin called BitcoinXT that were being deleted for prompting protocol altering implementations without overwhelming consensus, there was a notable increase in trolling here, there were cries of censorship on Reddit in general related to the Ellen Pao biz, the strict moderation policies of were called out as censorship, Theymos was vilified as censorship master due to his perceived control of the main discussion channels, was created and many people upset about censorship had a place to discuss alternative protocols, it was always a little hostile over there, but it has since become a place for trolls, buttcoiners, alt pumpers, and obnoxious man babies, the arguing got worse, each sub would have immature numpties brigading the opposing sub, most people got sick of it and chilled out, then the price went up a lot, and the get-rich-quick masses flooded back in another wave, which added a lot of new blood to be manipulated, so here we are dealing with poorly thought out arguments every fucking day, trying to end the vitriol and bring the community back together. Most everyone wants to scale with segwit, except Bitmain and friends, who benefit from using covert asicboost. Google asicboost, if you're interested to know more. Since most users want segwit, and the majority of the hash power (Bitmain) is stonewalling, a chunk of the community want to softfork to reject non segwit blocks. In response, Bitmain has proposed a hard fork in the event of the users attempting to regain control of the network from the miners. Also in response, a chunk of the economic players in the ecosystem have proposed a "compromise" that involves activating segwit along with a hard fork block size increase. Hardly any developers are on board, which is adding to the confusion for new and old users alike. Many are hoping that a reasonable solution can be found, so that no single group is responsible for basically hijacking the network to move forward.
Gavin has gone from being an active coder to an active troll, sadly. You can find him posting ridiculous tweets, getting bamboozled by scammers, fueling the division. It's odd how much he's changed in the last few years.
Finally, Bitcoin core is open source software that is the product of decentralized development that started with Satoshi. It used to just be called Bitcoin. It's on [github]( XT, Classic, BU, etc, are alternative implementations that alter the protocol. If the network decides those are Bitcoin, they are Bitcoin. Until then, they are attempting to change the rules without overwhelming consensus. These implementations can be discussed here, but if you try to pump or promote something that alters the protocol without overwhelming consensus, your post will be removed by mods.

It wasn't my intention to be condescending. It's not often that I'm sitting down, much less sitting at a computer. I usually reply hastily from a phone, which isn't the easiest thing to do (especially with dirt on my hands), so apologies.
UASF is voluntary. **Miners can still make non-segwit blocks, and they will be accepted**. They are just required to signal readiness for segwit. It is backwards compatible.
Miners mine the majority chain. If UASF fails to get a majority of the hashing power, the block discovery time would be ridiculous. Why would anyone use a chain that can't mine blocks in a reasonable amount of time? If no one uses it, it dies, and that might be what we see, come August.
On the other hand, as far as I understand it, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited sought to hard fork the network. We all watched as Ethereum attempted to deal with hard forking their community, and it wasn't pretty. And it's not like all posts about XT and Classic weren't allowed, they were just *much* more strictly moderated (perhaps too strictly). The moderation has definitely been toned down recently, to the point of unreasonably allowing pumping of things like UASF.
Regardless, I think the outcome of the UASF will be a failed soft fork, and the protocol will go on unchanged. Unless, of course, there's enough support from miners, which requires at least a majority. If it's close to 50/50, there could be drama for a bit, but the miners will inevitably mine the longest chain. Hash power will shift accordingly. Either way, **no one is being forced to use segwit**.
No matter what, some interesting things are going to happen. If Bitcoin can't survive this, then it's not as anti-fragile as some have thought. I believe that Bitcoin will honey badger on, like it has thus far. I see no reason to believe that UASF will cause a network split. I also don't see how UASF seeks to change the protocol without overwhelming consensus.

You're right, actually. Segwit was proposed as a scaling solution (that addressed multiple issues and didn't require a hard fork) at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong in Dec 2015. It was then the chosen compromise that everyone agreed on at the Hong Kong Agreement, just a few months later. The Hong Kong agreement was an agreement (by a representation of *some* of the main players in the mining and dev communities) to implement the segwit soft fork, followed by the development of a block size increase hard fork. So far Bitmain/Antpool (who were participants in the HK agreement) have been the main force stonewalling progress on this path. It is now segwit maybe, hardfork at all costs, for Bitmain. Hence UASF. Hence NYA/Segwit2x. Hence confusion, and FUD, and manipulation, and more stonewalling.

These dinosaurs will never see the shit hole they will be leaving behind. They're infringing upon the basic human rights of every individual on this planet. "Oh. but my tax money!" Money won't mean shit in this future. People need to **wake the fuck up**. Think that republicans are anti-banks, or anti-establishment? They're the establishment, and they're bankers. They've replaced "the swamp" with their own version of the same thing. They're not even anti-regulation, like they claim so hard to be. They're anti-regulation when it comes to regulation that regulates their business interests. They're pro-regulation when it comes to regulating things they don't like, or things they can't profit enough from. This is only 4 months into this current administration/legislature.

Now the whole world has to deal with it. Thanks old fucks (who won't be around to see the shit stain they left behind)! Thanks two party lesser-of-two-evils bullshit! Thanks uninformed populous!

It's not as binary as that. Some are fine with cautiously implemented hard fork upgrades. Some are not. Only a fraction of actual developer representation was at these agreements, btw (especially the NYA)

Voting to put/keep criminals in power *is* wrong. What I was calling out as stupid was what seemed like someone deciding that they should vote for some of these disgraceful human beings based on a single issue. I still don't even know if that's what the case was. They might have just been on the fence, and this IRS thing really sealed the deal for them.

A soft fork needs consensus to be the new chain. If this UASF fails, Bitcoin goes on unchanged. If it succeeds, there must be overwhelming consensus. See now?

The large amount of uninformed voting in this country is a problem. It's not reality tv, it's our fucking lives and livelihoods. Fuck republicans. Fuck democrats. Fuck all of these criminal organizations that are meant to serve the selfish agendas of shitty people. 
I will not hesitate to point out the stupidity of siding with a party over single issues. This government may be trying to fight the first amendment in this country, but that shit still stands. I intend to exercise my rights while I still have them, thank you

No, that's not right, sorry.
Group A wanted to fix issues that already affected Bitcoin. Malleability.
Group B wanted block size increase.
Group A offers both.

A hardfork without overwhelming consensus would undoubtedly fracture this multi billion dollar network. What is safe about a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:34:04
Core isn't a person or a company. The developers that contribute to bitcoin core all have differing opinions about most every issue. Before segwit existed, tx malleability needed to be fixed. Block size increase was seen as a future scaling hurdle that needed to be addressed eventually. There was a bunch of blog posts and tweets about what direction to go. There was a gathering in Hong Kong, similar to the recent gathering in New York, where some influential members of the community came together to find a compromise. Enter segwit. A compromise.

Bigger blocks will fill up. Fees will return. Miners will have even more power.
They don't want the kind of scaling that has been proposed. Layer 2 solutions will reduce their fees. Why participate in layer 2 when more profit can be made gaming layer 1 with monopolistic control?

You're welcome! I missed most of the drama of the early days, even Mt Gox. Most of what I've witnessed has to do with the block size debate over the past 2.5 years, so that's what I feel confident talking more deeply about. Glad folks appreciate it

The priority of core was to fix tx malleability. Much of the community agreed/agrees that a block size increase should happen at some point. Original segwit offers both the original goals of the core devs, but also offers a modest block size increase. Multiple core devs have cautioned against raising the block size too drastically too quickly. Og segwit fixes the issues that were the priority of the devs, while also increasing the block size in a responsible manner

It's hard to say. I only buy with cash, so it's not as easy as using a debit/credit card. Because of this, as well as the huge rise in price, I haven't purchased bitcoin in months. I've been waiting for a price dip for some time now, but it keeps rising. Hard to say what tomorrow will bring. Lots of people that use debit/credit cards on exchanges do dollar cost averaging, which I would do if I had a bank account.
There's a group called Adamant (or something along those lines) that discusses the future value of bitcoin. There's a guy named Turr Demeester(sp?) who is associated with Adamant that posts about bitcoin on his blog and twitter

I think the issue is more changing the block size limit. Segwit increases block size without having to adjust the hard coded block size limit. I don't really know of many people who are against the block size increase that segwit offers
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:21:33

I played around with about $50 worth of bitcoin on bitlendingclub/loanbase for the last year or so. Stopped participating because of a few large scammers. Went back on recently because they started allowing partial repayments for defaulters. I moved my balance to my own wallet, which was less btc than I put on the site, but with the price increase is now worth around 3 times as much. I probably won't try lending again until the scene improves. Not enough protection for lenders. Too easy for scammers to not be held accountable. They (loanbase) apparently are working with a collection agency now (though not in the US), but that doesn't seem to have any results thus far for any loan I have been a part of

Buy something inexpensive through purse.io/Amazon. Once you own something physical that you paid for with bitcoin, it's a bit easier to show people that it's money. That, along with the suggestion from u/tmornini , should help your case quite a bit
