That had little to do with the war.

International payments often can't be made outside of certain banking hours. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:52:16
Many businesses and business people do.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:17:01
Actually it's very rare for them not to. It's in their own best interests to remove the ransomware. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:15:36
Not really. They have no incentive to do that, whereas they have incentive to unlock the files. Unlocking the files = repeat customers. If everyone knows they never unlock the files, no-one would pay the ransom. 
I was hit by ransomware earlier this year and had my files unlocked a few hours after sending the ransom. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:45:16
How do you know? There's still a year to go.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:59:08
Why? Its a logical move for them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:06
So it's fine for you to compare bitcoin and gold to make a point but when I do it it's "apples and oranges"?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:07:00
You don't have free banking/atm in your country?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:12:26
Because it's not safe. Acknowledging the risk in any money you put into crypto is mature.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:45:31
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:51:23
ATMs are free here at least. So are many types of current account.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:26:00
No, help them to understand the degree of risk which they are taking and make an informed decision based on that. Nothing is truly safe but some things are safer than others, there's nothing wrong with acknowledging that.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:31:46
Sure, it's possible. I'm not denying that. But at the same time, if the cost of not paying the ransom far exeeds the cost of paying the ransom, then the only logical move is to pay the ransom, even knowing full well that you might not get your files back. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:00:21
Gold can be lost in a nuclear blast, bitcoin can survive as long as the ledger survives somewhere in the distrubuted network. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:40
You only consider it volatile when it's going down? It's been volatile for years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:28
The ledger is decentralised, and the authority. Not the bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:56:51
They won't. They will simply have to do additional verification, if you're dealing with huge sums you get special treatment. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:09
If it drops of the chain it's as if the transaction never happened - the funds are still yours to spend and are available in your wallet again. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:03:51
But if the new one is worth nothing then how has money been printed?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:45:21
To exist, no it doesn't. To cash it back into fiat currency however, you do owe taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:16:30
Why be so condescending? Thousands of businesses have been hit, from huge multi-nationals to tiny mom and pop operations. You have no idea what type of company this guy has, nor the measures he took to prevent this. Either way, your comments aren't helpful. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:27:09
In that sense nothing in the world is free then. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:12:35
Shut up baby.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:47:18
What else are they going to do when backups fail or were inadequate and the cost of NOT paying exceeds the cost of paying (in terms of downtime and data lost being more costly than the ransom). 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:29:50
You do realise tulip mania didn't actually happen the way people think, right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:48:29
So? It goes up, it goes down. Why are you surprised?

Link to your yt?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:36:50
That sounds nice but the even if you invest $100, then the price raises so much that you have effectively $20,000 worth, just because you withdrew the original $100 doesn't mean you 'didnt lose money' if it crashes down to $1. That money is still your money.

Beginners guide on how to do it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:32:59
But it wasn't the same in many other cases where something revolutionary genuinely occurred and changed the market. How can you tell which is which?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:51:54
Not sure about big companies but I know a couple of friends who got hit and they both got their stuff unencrypted after paying. Think about it, it's actually in the Ransomware owners best interests to unencrypt the files as if it's well known that you get your stuff back upon paying then more people will actually pay. Of course there's absolutely no guarantee whatsoever on that one and each individual "ransomer" would be different I suppose.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:06:29
Sorry, noob question, but what does FUD mean? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:09:12
Thanks. Kept seeing it everywhere but couldn't guess it!
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:21:54
I see. Thanks for the help.

Do you think that this chart applies to every investment, share price, commodity, etc that has ever been created? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:02:29
Pay off the debts and house and tell her you'll tell her how you've done it when you take her on a nice holiday that you're gonna pay for. She'll take it much better then, believe me. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:59:45
You think backing up a hugely complex network of systems across multiple locations, offices, intermingled with other companies, with sloppy employees, laziness and human error creeping in is an easy task? I'm not saying they don't HAVE backups, I'm saying that even huge companies can get hit by ransomware and find that the systems they had in place to prevent something from harming them hasn't completely protected them or has protected them to some extent but they may have still lost data that can be worth more to them than the price of the ransom.

That's why I always pointed out it was ridiculously stupid advice that people kept repeating towards the end of 2017 which is: "sell your initial stake then you can't lose! you're playing with the houses money!"
It's literally all your money, initial stake or not.
