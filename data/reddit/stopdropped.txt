Jail and Bcash would crash if it's proven to be a scam being manipulated by its creators. Anybody investing in Bcash at that point would be pretty stupid.
EDIT: I do believe there was insider trading of some form and I hope they all rot in jail, especially Roger Ver who is already a known scammer (Mt. Gox)
EDIT: Fixed word

- Bitcoin = Bitcoin
- Bitcoin Cash = Bitcoin Cash. Take out Bitcoin name from Bitcoin Cash, it's profiting off the name but it's a pure shit coin.

Also, when you try and Buy It, it states "Subtotal is invalid".
To me, it seems like Bitcoin Cash is in the midst of being completely removed. If this doesn't have red flags popping up everywhere, nothing will. I'll bet somebody is going to get in some legal trouble over this bullshit.

I mean creators, sorry. Jihan Wu and Roger Ver, both pretty scummy dudes.

Has use? I know of nobody who uses BCash for peer-to-peer transactions. Bcash is run by juvenile adults who react like monkeys and believe since they're rich they are above everybody else.
Good luck with your shit coin!

I just got into the game last night. Bought 3 BTC at 3.85k, just sold them for 4150$ each, not a bad start for my first day!
I've been timing it for a few days and know approximately when it dips down when most investors are sleeping i'm guessing.

No, Napster allowed access to music that would otherwise not be available online, voluntarily that is.
Bitcoin is a technology that ultimately will eliminate monetary fees between peer-to-peer and business-to-business transactions. If you understand the technology, it's easy to understand how it's far superior to today's centralized banking system.
Sure, some regulation will be needed for Bitcoin to be adopted globally, but once it does the world will be a better place.

Dude, the 137 BTC sell wall at 10k on Bittrex got gobbled up in literally 0.5 seconds. Sell wall's won't stop this momentum, we're making a big boost.
Crushing 10,000$ USD is an absolute psychological barrier that make people get serious FOMO. I say this train continues to 12.5k
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:57:49
It's at over 6500$ on Bittrex, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:37:18
Good for you! I hope you put all your money in 2X and it tanks to 0$, how about that? :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:47:50
Always better to buy yesterday. In other words any time is a good time, cost average. Buy in at different price levels and HODL.

CALL LAMBORGHINI HQ! WE WILL NEED THEM TO MAKE 100X SUPPLY REALLY SOON!

You just missed the dip. It's Crpto buddy, you literally have minutes to act - MAX.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:41:50
How did Coinbase ruin it for you? I'll bet that the problem is probably between the chair and the keyboard ;)
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:56:44
Just buy when you can afford to do so. Cost price averaging long-term is fine regardless of the price. You'll be buying at multiple price points. In a year from now, you'd kill somebody to buy Bitcoin at 8k, no joke!
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:16:15
LOL, so true. Once it hits like 10,150$ though, it's going to moon nicely!
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:35:43
Already there buddy!
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:52:28
I got in around 4.5k USD 2 months ago. I tripled my investment so far. It will only get better! What a fucking great time to be alive though :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:17:06
At this pace, it will be 100k by the end of 2018. If that actually happens, well this place is gonna be a fucking hoot!
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:07:46
How is it a scam? Their fees might be on the higher side, but that doesn't make it a scam. You are literally making bullshit claims.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:17:52
Sounds like that's a mistake on your part for not doing your research and assuming they would accept your deposit. That's not a scam, that's an oversight on your part.

The math is completely off, you're referencing 500$ USD worth of BTC for your 50$.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:32:59
I have had 1/2 pending deposits for like 20 min. before the wallet got locked. What happens to my coins now?
