I smell a troll. Who pays you?

It has got to be one of the oddest things, that people put so much time and money into influencing others opinions as to hire people as trolls to bug others on social networks. I think it goes to show how worthless the ideas they are trying to fight for are. Look up white house paid trolls, lol.
BTC FTW!

My wife is right about at the first one.  And exactly, they will say "it's not worth anything, how can you buy anything with it? You're better off with [value-less fiat being robbed by central banks]."
As for my wife, she was excited about the concept until she started thinking that I was going to buy in.  So I did it and told her afterword. I tend to avoid mentioning it.  It was only 10 BTC anyway.

any suggestions about how to go about timing it?

thankfully, advanced transaction features will only be icing on the cake.  as the core of bitcoin is p2p cryptocurrency, it is at least open and comprehensible.  Compare that to the federal reserve, who controls the dollar. It is a private organisation, with private, centralized interests.
Bitcoin operates on algorithm.  We can estimate the end from the beginning in bitcoin, and it is thus both stable, open, and comprehensible.

Finally, someone understands that part of this is making my wife happy.  I see that you likely aren't a 14 year old in your mothers basement :)
