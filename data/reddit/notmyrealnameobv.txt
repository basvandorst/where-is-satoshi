If I have enough money working for me to produce enough money for me to survive on, I can stop working and do something I enjoy doing instead.
Or, if I actually have a job I enjoy, I get more money to spend on shit.

They would have to invest in new hardware to increase hashing power. New hardware has an upfront cost, which means that for a while the hardware is not making a profit, it's simply earning back the investment.
If the reward (new coins plus fees) per block goes down (in fiat), the ROI increases. At some point it's just not worth it anymore. But at which point? 6 months? One year? Five years? 20 years? 100 years?

Bitcoin halving time is every 210.000 blocks.
Mining time per block is 10 minutes on average.
As less and less new bitcoins are generated, there might be a decline in hashing power. But it's also possible that an increase in value of bitcoin in combination with transaction fees keep profítability up to prevent loss of hashing power.
If hashing power decrease, so will the difficulty (every 2016 blocks). So if profitability drops, some miners will probably stop mining. This means that difficulty will drop, which means more bitcoins mined per H/s.
This will likely bring some miners back, since it will now be more profitable to mine (less ASICs needed, which means less space and electricity needed, which means less cost per bitcoin).
And even if bitcoin mining died almost completely, I'm sure there will be some enthusiasts that are willing to mine just for fun (or, more likely, in the hopes of a Bitcoin revival).

In the apples market, do you really think someone holds apples for a year? That would be some really funky apples that gets delivered...
What happens is, someone offers a future that offers to buy 1 bitcoin at $300, that is based on today's price, $300.
Tomorrow, the price drops to $200.
Someone notices the discrepancy, i.e. an arbitrage opportunity. So they buy the future and a bitcoin. Now they have locked in a profit of $100, since they can sell the 1 bitcoin they bought when the contract expires, and regardless of how the price of bitcoin have moved (see my previous examples) they will be up one bitcoin.
How does this affect the price of bitcoin?
Well, notice that in order to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity, someone had to go buy an actual bitcoin. If we imagine that everyone owning bitcoin are HODLers and agree that 1 bitcoin was actually worth $300, except one person that had 1 bitcoin that he for some reason really wanted to get rid of it and thus put up a sell order for $200.
Now, it's possible to buy bitcoin (although only one of them) for $200. So the price to buy bitcoin is $200.
Once our arbitrager notices this opportunity and buys that bitcoin, the price again moves back to $300 (because there is no longer anyone willing to sell, and all buyers want to buy at $300).
So, because of the arbitrage opportunity made possible by futures, the price to actually buy bitcoin has moved. Even though no bitcoin 's were needed in order for the future contract to be used.
Edit: If the arbitrager already owns bitcoin, he can sell it if he finds an opportunity for arbitrage in te opposite direction.

Ah, so just because I critique your argumentation, I'm a troll and a FUDster?

Doesn't cash settled mean that at the end of contract, there will be some cash transferred between the buyer and seller of the contract to ensure the net cost for the buyer will be the agreed upon price?
For instance, in your example, if the price is 300 when the contract expires, there will be no money changing hands because the buyer can just buy a bitcoin for 300.
Or, if the bitcoin drops to 100, the buyer of the contract has to transfer 200 to the seller.
Or, if the price increase to 500, the seller must transfer 200 to the buyer.
In each case, the seller can just sell his bitcoin just before the transfer, and be up 100 after the transfer.

Edit: Please don't completely rewrite your post, it makes the conversation really difficult to follow. :)
That doesn't make any sense... What you're saying is that regardless of the price movement of bitcoin, the seller of the contract of 1 bitcoin for $300 will just get $300 at the end of the contract? Where does bitcoin come into the picture then???
My understanding of a cash settled future is this:
At the time of buying a contract, the buyer and seller of the contract agrees that at the settlement, the seller will provide one bitcoin in exchange for $300. However, since the seller can't actually give the buyer the actual bitcoin, he has to give the buyer the equivalent cash size minus the $300 that the buyer is expecting to buy the 1 bitcoin for, if the price exceeds $300. If the price is lower than $300, the buyer gives the seller the difference.
For example: Bitcoin goes up to $400. The buyer expects to only pay $300, so the seller has to provide the difference, i.e. the seller gives the buyer $100.
Another example: Bitcoin stays at $200. Since the buyer wanted to buy at $300, he has to send the difference $100 to the seller.

The price is defined by the equilibrium, i.e. where there is nobody willing to buy more expensive and nobody willing to sell cheaper. This, of course, change every second.
If there is suddenly nobody willing to pay for bitcoin, the price would essentially be 0.

Stopped reading right there. I have upgraded my computer (mobo, cpu, RAM, gfx card, hard drives) multiple times, still running on the same license I got many years ago (Win7 license, upgraded to Win10).

Because they want to push the narrative that BCash is the real Bitcoin. And it's harder to do if the name doesn't contain "Bitcoin".
