The article sentence would read:
After all, much of modern ~~pecuniary~~ activity already involves bits rather than bob and consumers have embraced credit cards, electronic transfers and the like.

It's a matter of "if" not "when" retailers begin to accept bitcoins since there is no guarantee. It has to be worth it for retailers to accept bitcoins. For some retailers it will prove profitable and for others it may not.
