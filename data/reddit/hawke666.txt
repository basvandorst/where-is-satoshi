It's not really an email thing, it's a 'some email systems' thing (possibly even specific to gmail, possibly others have followed their lead).
The reason you didn't know that, and the reason that more people don't do this, is that not everyone uses gmail.
Edit: More [detail]( runbox, gmail, icloud, outlook.com, fastmail all use plus; Yahoo, Qmail, Courier use a minus; MMDF uses equals; Postfix lets you configure whatever character you want. Basically the only thing standard is that there is no standard.

And it even has a decent ending unlike every other Stephenson novel.

But if it’s British it might tell you to press hash or the hash key/sign.

So they sentenced him for something he was not convicted of? Nice…

They also do quote a lot of automation hardware stuff -- industrial automation, security systems, etc.

Sure, I’d certainly agree that a smartphone is not unlike the device described. Smartphone is not the same thing as a debit card though,

Starship Troopers two was awful. One of the worst movies I’ve seen.

Your debit card must work very differently from most.
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:09:44
wow, yeah it’s like an entirely different device! crazy!
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:50:24
“little machine with a digital readout”, “punch in the [anything]” “coded to your thumbprint”.
That is zero out of three for a debit card, the only thing similar is the size and the fact that it allows you to move money from account to another.

I am aware. You said “starship troopers too” but I guess joking about homophones doesn’t really work in text format.

Smart cards are cheaper, but card readers are far from ubiquitous, and the software support is shit.

I’m kinda curious now — I don’t think the Apple II even had weird screws, did it? I think those shenanigans started with the Macintosh line. Or maybe the Lisa?
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:44:15
don't the position boxes make it only 2? Or do the pictures actually produce the position boxes regardless of orientation?
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:38:51
Huh? The first apple computer in production didn’t even have a case, let alone screws holding the case closed.

Technically no, but does anyone actually still use credit card imprinter machines? I guess I’ve seen them used once or twice when the power went out…
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:47:15
You wouldn’t, but the businesses you’re interacting with would.
edit: I mean, assuming that you want to enforce the “no electronic devices” concept.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:02:01
Electronic devices are still required in order for you to use your credit card. (with the exception of places that use a credit card imprinter, which is very rare these days)
Without electronic devices, your credit card is basically just a useless piece of plastic.

Just 1 euro? Wow.

More likely per gallon.

But I don't know any actors!

They have an interest in harming a buyer who fails to pay up, or intends to rob them of the drugs instead of buying.

In weather where you can't see a speed limit sign, how are you supposed to know where you are well enough to know the speed limit for that location?
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:03:40


That seems idiotic.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:44:51
Fair enough, though it’s probably a valid assumption given that the picture is of US currency.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:31:28
Only if it’s somehow fraudulent.
