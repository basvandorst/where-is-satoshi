All "bitcoin debit cards" are in fact fiat cards, I mean worthless goat shit fiat.  
Bitcoin will never "back" a credit card and will never be a "debit card". You own bitcoins, you can't debit them. You do not own them you cannot spend them. Simple like that.  
A credit card = money created from nothing, money that you are paying later with taxes (forget about interest, that is nothing).  
**Bitcoin  = money that you cannot spend it if you do not own it**  
More than this:  
**There is NO such thing of "bitcoin debit cards"!**  
Those cards are fiat cards, linked to a bank account, linked to your name, linked to all your shopping, linked to all your movements...  
Those cards are created EXACTLY to slow down the full adoption of Bitcoin and keep you chained to their fiat and bank accounts.  
Do not fall into this trap of banksters!  
A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them. The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Going back to plastic cards use, is going back to slavery masters...

Then I will add a message for Citi: 
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:41:17
But that is not a "restoring backup" is a sending coins to a new wallet address.  
From your page:  
- Go to this page, enter your wallet passphrase and copy your wallet passcode  
- Go to the Bitgo Recovery tool. You can either use the online version or for ever more security, you can run it offline.  
- First form field: Enter the wallet passcode you got from the popup on the Bitwala page  
- Second, Third and Forth form fields: Copy and paste the data next to the QR codes into the form for the top three qr codes  
- Fifth field (you have a misspelling there): Enter your new bitcoin address    
So Bitwala actually is a BitGo wallet and you never have the private keys... just a backup emergency sending funds to a new wallet that you control.  
This is not what I was expected for a "controlled wallet".
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:45:33

Voting is for sheeple. In special for a puppet or a devil.  
Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about politicians. And politicians will do nothing for Bitcoin because they know that Bitcoin will bring their end... In Bitcoinlandia, politicians and banksters are the dinosaurs in extinction mode.  
If you still think that your vote will help a side or another and that side will do something for you, you are a fool. Politicians are put in place by banksters. Point and clear. The rest is just an illusion of freedom, illusion of democracy.  
Take a look at your actual "world"   
Or just buy some of these with BTC 
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:15:28
You can't spend nor because Bitcoin is not adopted, but because people still want to use that worthless goat shit fiat.  
All start by working for bitcoins. That will push your employer to accept BTC, then you have to convince more people to use it, then more merchants will want to use it because they see you use it. If you continue to go to a shop with a plastic card, that merchant will never know that Bitcoin exist or what can do for his shop.  
But yes, people are lazy, why they should start changing something, maybe some others will start the changes, they will just wait... and wait... and wait. In this way the Bitcoin Revolution that everybody is waiting for, will never happen. And all Satoshi's work will be for nothing.  
Let's be clear: **there is no way to get out of this deep shit we are in now (that banksters created) if we do not get out of fiat use. Bitcoin is the salvation.**

Nope, my landlord accetp my rent in BTC, a grocery store on my street accept BTC, gas station too, bars. Where I live not everybody is "crazy" about plastic cards and fiat. Those who accept BTC, they take payments directly to their BTC wallets. Cashila.com is paying very well all other bills, no need of bank account.  
Bitcoin is P2P money, why do we need intermediaries?

@_date: 2016-08-07 08:18:46
You should be more careful with exchanges that hide their real owners. WHOIS info of the site nova.exchange shows just a protected registrar.  
Are you really going to give your money to somebody that hide his identity? When are money involved, transparency is the key.  
**You have been warned**
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:43:34
Bitsquare is a [DECENTRALIZED]( P2P exchange and there is no one behind this exchange. Or maybe you do not understand the word **decentralized**. Like Bitcoin is decentralized P2P money, the same way Bitsquare is an exchange.  
Read this   
Bitsquare is NOT a replacement for other exchanges. IS ONLY A TOTAL DIFFERENT TYPE OF EXCHANGE.  
If you want to keep your financial privacy and not be robbed, use Bitsquare.  
If you don't care about your financial privacy (like your freedom of speech) and don't mind to be robbed, seized, tracked you can use any other "regulated", normal exchange. It's your choice.  
Maybe you should start watching this speech about decentralization   
DISCLAIMER:  
I am not an affiliate or dev or anything else related with this exchange. I'm not even using it, because I don't have to: I earn BTC so no need to buy anymore.  
I was telling people here about this exchange months ago and everybody was ignore it. Now they start looking into it because they start seeing like the only option to have a DECENTRALIZED exchange and start understanding what really is decentralization (like Bitcoin network).
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:55:57
Please post to r/coinbase, we are tired to hear all days about this shity banksters company.

I don't vote. Maybe other user, but wasn't me.  
We don't need "day traders", they are damaging Bitcoin not helping it.  
Actually soon, we will not need them anymore to create "volumes". Because nobody will use anymore exchanges to buy/sell BTC with fiat. Everybody will use Bitcoin or other cryptos and when they need to exchange them will use P2P exchanges like shapeshift or bitsquare or whatever other new P2P exchange.  
We are making too much noise just for another exchange hacked. We can live without it and many will appear more. And also they will be hacked again.  
Bitcoin is not touched, is just continuing his path.  
So let's move on and concentrate in things that matter (not exchanges), how we will gonna deal with the full blocks and high fees.

I did also my part for "Bitcoin Revolution". From only 1 person using BTC in my local community (me), now we are almost 60% bitcoiners. Starting with my landlord and grocery shop owner, people get interested and start using it for local exchanges/shopping.  
For the moment I am the only one living on BTC exclusively but there are more that will do this step soon.  
Next step will be to convince the local authorities to use it too. That will be hard.  
I am sorry that I can't say where is the place, we do not want to became a "media target" or even worse a "gov target". What I can say is that is a small community in EU. We (local bitcoiners) all agreed to keep this quiet for a while and not making too much noise so the authorities/media can hunt us.

Bitcoin doesn't need the "help" of those apps. Bitcoin will do just fine without them. You don't need a messenger app to send BTC, you need only your wallet.

For the banksters it's easy and they cost them NOTHING to give some fake money to a startup.  
Let's be clear: when a bank is "investing" is not using any real money, just IOUs fake money that they create out of nothing, but they put in debt those in who they "invest" in exchange not for profits, but for control...  
Wake up people! Banksters don't have any real money, they will never come to a company with a truck full of cash, saying here this is for your company... No they just create a shit paper where it says IOU x fiat worthless goat shit. Now I own you.

Or just buy online groceries with BTC in Germany   
I live on BTC for more than a year, but my solution to spend only BTC (no cash, no BS cards, no BS giftcards) it was to talk with shop owners around me and convince them to accept my BTC. Some are skeptics some are very welcomed. The skeptics will became later very welcomed when they see that the one next to him sell more :)... for BTC.  
One time I remember I went to a shop and they had a product that I wanted to buy. When I asked if I can pay with BTC the cashier said that have to ask the owner. The owner came and he said a quick NO. Then I said, OK I will go the next shop (1 block away) so I can pay with BTC. I headed to the exit and when I was out of the shop, the owner came to me and start asking what is all about this BTC. Then a new "friendship" started...  
I think the BTC acceptance start with each one of us and how we are dealing with merchants. Many merchants doesn't really know about BTC but once they know are really attracted by the idea of "people's money". So guys, don't just wait until the "merchants consortium" will announce on TV thjat from now on all shops will accept BTC. That will never happen. Start at low level, in your local community. Will spread immediately.

In few years USD will be mentioned only in history books. So no worth thinking that you will be rich in worthless goat shit fiat.  
You should be concerned more about how many BTC you have in your wallet not how much USD worth your satoshis...  
I think you forgot something very important:  
fiat/USD = endless printing/creating by banksters  
Bitcoin = limited to 21 millions, generated by mining, proof of existence  
  
Ah, if you want to make a comparison of store of value, better relation will be BTC/GOLD. That makes sense.

Bitsquare is creating a wallet that you are always in control of your funds. A hacker will have to hack each computer in order to have a decent amount of funds... so no worth the effort. That's why is named **decentralized**.  
Everything is hackable, but for a bunch of satoshis nobody will take the risks, effort and time. That's why hackers go for **centralized** and big exchanges, the prize is much bigger, quicker and easier.

I will tell you my sincere opinion.  
I love to see strong altcoins, because that will make also Bitcoin stronger currency. People are buying altcoins with BTC so always will be an exchange volume up/down and that is good.  
When I get into Bitcoin back in 2011 later I find out about Litecoin and Namecoin. I like their "concept" so I bought some, with BTC, not fiat. I still have some. And not for their "value". I don't care about value, for me are money and maybe someday I will use them for something (but never sell for fiat).  
So, after few years we see hundreds of new altcoins and some are very attractive (for me not like an investment, but like an instrument of payment).  
For example Dash is quite interesting like altcoin or form of payment. And is quite "pushed" on the market now.  
But you see? Being a "late appearance" also can be a trap.  
As I always said, banksters will do everything possible to crush or slow down all types of money that they can't control, including the option to create a so called "altcoin", push it into the market, "growing it" like their child until people get used to have it and then crush it. They have huge resources and willing to do that.  
So the big question is which altcoin from the new ones can be one that is controlled by banksters? That's why Bitcoin will remain the virgin and untouchable and will be the "digital gold", Litecoin the "digital silver" and Namecoin, something that we still have to decide :). The rest, I still have doubts...  
For the moment I see the altcoins just another scam scheme from "sharks" that just want to get rich from innocence of other fools. Trading altcoins for profit will end up in a failure.

Good intention but the product is just another chat app. No BTC wallet for a Bitcoin app? I can chat with tons of other apps in the same way.  
GetGemz and Wiper already did it and are even paying users for ads.  
BitBuds doesn't have even a BitcoinMap integrated or something like a directory.  
You want to penetrate the market with this app? Take in consideration these:  
- Bitcoin wallet in the app, HD, easy to export keys, make backups.  
- Bitcoin merchant directory, or just integrate coinmap.org  
- Merchants advertising: those who are near to the user location can push ads on a special channel ad to them, who want to read them can get a discount, bonus or something. Merchants pay the ad, wallet devs get a cut and user get a bonus, All wins. Bitcoin wins, because all merchants have to accept BTC in their shops. In this way the spread of using Bitcoin will be faster.

I see that you have **ZERO** knowledge about Bitcoin.  
I will tell you some basic rules/facts:  
- bitcoins will always stay on the blockchain (the public ledger), will never move from a wallet/person to another  
- when you own bitc owns means that you own the keys to open/control those bitcoins, you are a keys owner, exactly like safety deposit box in a bank, your cash is in some box, and the key to open that box is that you have with you.  
- you don't have that key, you do not own those bitcoins. You have that key, you own the bitcoins.  
- doesn't matter if your harddrive is dead, if you still have those private keys, you can access your bitcoins anywhere, anytime.  
- if you can't find those keys, consider that your bitcoins are gone forever and is your fault.  
- a good read to start learning about Bitcoin is this book:   
I really don't know how to react to these kind of posts: to laugh, to cry, to be angry, to ignore...

You can think whatever you want, but there is a fact: that card IS NOT USING BTC, BUT FIAT transactions.  
Bitcoin was created to get out of fiat not to find a way around but still using it. It's like you are in prison and you get weekly 1 day out of prison. But you still will be a inmate for life, never be free.  
Those cards are VIOLATING your financial privacy! Your financial privacy is like your freedom of speech.  
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody will know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you have) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check

Shapeshift them. Until you can.  
All my income is in BTC directly and I do this very often.  
Usually I have 2-3 income addresses that always I exchange those BTC into another altcoins and back to new created BTC addresses (not immediately). I spread also the amount into many small amounts to different wallets too, for convenience.  
In this way NOBODY can trace back to you the original inputs.  
Also sometimes you can have few profit from the exchange into altcoins, depends how organized you are and watching the prices.  
Shapeshift.io now is already integrated in many apps and wallets.  
Also you can use bitsquare.io the P2P decentralized exchange for that, so no need to use another "watched" exchange to shapeshift your coins.

Use a damn decentralized P2P exchange like Bitsquare.io. All your money are in your control, nobody is tracking you.  
That interaction is just between you and the other party of exchange. The exchange is just the intermediary/escrow/mediator, is not keeping/tracking your money. Your funds are always in 
For the others the bank transaction will be just between 2 normal individuals with no other details/alerts/trackings. Nobody will know that you send x amount of fiat to x guy that sells you x BTC. Nobody.

**That limit is for a reason**: to no be hackable. A hacker will not go for small amounts.

Do not let banksters to fool you! All "bitcoin debit cards" are in fact fiat cards, I mean worthless goat shit fiat.  
Bitcoin will never "back" a credit card and will never be a "debit card". You own bitcoins, you can't debit them. You do not own them you cannot spend them. Simple like that.  
A credit card = money created from nothing, money that you are paying later with taxes (forget about interest, that is nothing).  
**Bitcoin  = money that you cannot spend it if you do not own it**  
More than this:  
**There is NO such thing of "bitcoin debit cards"!**  
Those cards are fiat cards, linked to a bank account, linked to your name, linked to all your shopping, linked to all your movements...  
Those cards are created EXACTLY to slow down the full adoption of Bitcoin and keep you chained to their fiat and bank accounts.  
Do not fall into this trap of banksters! Use your BTC wallet and be free!  
A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them. The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Going back to plastic cards use, is going back to slavery masters...

So you study Bitcoin for years and still do not know which wallet to use?
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:21:55
People are using centralized and tracked exchanges **because are fooled by the companies behind them to use them**. It's a business that many now see it is very profitable (also when they organize "hacks" and they can get away with user's money).  
When Bitcoin (a P2P **decentralized** money) was at the beginning also many come to say that Bitcoin **won't solve the problem of central banking** and yet we are at 8 years after and the central banking is shaken...  
All P2P decentralized exchanges solve their only one purpose: to serve the people that wants to exchange currencies.  
Next days we will see many shills "protecting" centralized and "regulated" exchanges, because **this is what govs want** to track, control all Bitcoin users.  
Now many like you will try to adapt Bitcoin to the existing banking and financial system. That will not work, Bitcoin is having his own system.  
"A very simple way to solve this problem is to introduce a clearing house mechanism to Bitcoin" - Bitcoin doesn't need a BS "clearing house". He already have one - blockchain.  
We have P2P decentralized money - Bitcoin  
We have P2P decentralized marketplace - OpenBazaar  
We have P2P decentralized exchange - Bitsquare  
We have P2P lending - CredibleFriends  
We will have many many things P2P and decentralized.  
Something to listen:

Because all of you in US don't know to use anything else than plastic cards, that in fact you are going back to fiat payments with those...  
Just tell me which of these services to pay bills are available in US?  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit  
 - recharge your phone credit  
  
  
  
  
See [this extract]( from the [Mastering Bitcoin book]( Is telling exactly the situation between plastic cards and BTC wallets. Who have eyes to see this will win, who is not seeing it, will lose.  
And BTW sometimes it's easier to see how things are getting worse in US from outside than from inside. People in US are too blind to see the deep shit where they are.

Cool! I think this will be the future of wallets: integrated services into wallet.  
Next step: integrate merchants from directory to be able to push ads to wallet users that are close to their location. Only these users will have a discount in those shops if they see the ads. In this way all parties win (wallet provider, merchants, users).
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:59:17
All these will pass, Bitcoin will still be fine. These are exchanges and traders problems not Bitcoin's problems, or mine. They were stupid enough so why should I care about them because they lose money ? I didn't force them to gamble, it was their decision.  
This is like with the banks, we have to bail them out because they lose money. FUCK THEM!

Few months ago I was playing a bit with one of my 5 nodes. I put the computer date in the past like 1 year ago. The blockchain still synced.  
Then I put it in the future like 2 years from now and I noticed that synced faster. But still synced OK.  
I think this is a prove that Bitcoin is time travel proof :)

Try cashila.com or bitwa.la, bitbill.eu in EU  
Try bylls.com in Canada, I think is working.  
Try piixpay.com in AUS  
Try coins.ph in Philipines  
Then see how is it.  
Also bitwage.com is great to receive your salary in BTC. No more bank accounts.  
And things are getting better and better every day. The world of Bitcoin is not just reddit, man. Look around, ask, search, do your homeworks.

@_date: 2016-08-08 08:49:58
**You have been warned here many times** before about this scam. First of all a company that re-branding very often actually is trying to create a scam.
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:06:30
**Of course is an inside job!**  
Also is following the pattern: **problem - reaction - solution**  
What we have to do is to ask: Qui Bono? And then we have many answers about this well organized "heist" that fooled many people.  
So let's see who can "profit" from this "heist":  
1. **Banksters**. As you know they will do everything possible to diminish the trust in cryptos and push their own agenda of bankcoins shit. As you saw immediately after the "heist" media jumped with pushing the "solutions" like bailout, bailins, put the coins into a bank, just stupid crazy BS.  
2. **Bitfinex staff**. They could organized themselves this "hack" exactly like MtGox. Nothing can stop them to do that. Is the best way to fool the users and they believe it quite easy. Scammers in general do that, first get to be trusted, accumulate users and funds and then bam! get away with the funds and slowly disappear.  
3. **Gov agencies**. Govs, pushed by banksters (their masters) wants to regulate as much as they can the friction point between banking and Bitcoin. In this way can "filter" all these ramps and track all users that are using Bitcoin. Gov agencies, have the resources and will to infiltrate and organize this "heist". Exactly like Silk Road case.  
4. **Other exchanges**. Today is a strong battle between exchanges, to attract as many users they can. Let's be honest, exchanges now are not anymore exchanges (a tool to change currencies) but trading platforms, some of them quite complicated, used only to make quick profits from fast trades that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. And people fall into this trap. So is possible that one or some other exchanges be involved in this "heist".  
All of these possible "perpetrators" follow the path:  
- create the **problem** - stole the users funds  
- wait for users **reaction** and sometimes with well positioned media articles, prepare their weak minds  
- come up with the **solution** that was well prepared before the "heist" because the heist it is just an instrument not the final goal.

I prefer that instead of "regulated" and tracked exchange, funded by banksters, from where in the end I will end up in a "Bitcoin user database".  
This kind of P2P exchange is just the beginning, soon we will have even more advanced exchanges. Bitsquare is just young, but that doesn't mean is not doing his purpose: to help people to get BTC and NOT be tracked.  
Everybody is looking for fast trading and quick profits, I see in Bitsquare the future of exchanging currencies. We have a wrong perception of exchanges today, seeing in them just a tool to get rich. But this is not the real purpose of an exchange. It is just a simple fact that people need to exchange vary currencies between them.  
Many people consider Bitcoin a new Wall St. HF trading, but they are WRONG.

No thanks, never, I have my own bank   
Average Joe = Stupid Joe = I don't care about stupid people  
This is just another brainwash from banksters for "average Joe" to fool them into giving them the new money. Exactly how they fool them with "giving me your gold to put it into my vaults and I will give you a paper where it says IOU x gold." **That was the biggest scam of humanity**...  
Banksters are desperate that they lose control of money now, so they will try over and over many tricks for "stupid average Joe". But there are news for them: average Joe is waking up from that biggest scam now.  
Oh man, again George Carlin best quote: "Never underestimate stupid people in large groups". It's unbelievable that people after they get robbed, scammed, fooled by banksters still want to go back to them again to be robbed, scammed, fooled etc.. The deserved to be stupid and robbed.  
Satoshi N.  took the power of creating and controlling the money from the banksters and give it to the people. But now the sheeple wants to give back that power to the banksters. This world is full of stupid people... And the banksters are laughing like crazy about them.

I see that you are not quite noob. You did well until now. Well done!  
There are 2 ways to have a "backup".  
One way is to keep safe only the see phrase, on some password manager app (offline), or write it down a piece of paper and keep safe that paper. I usually keep an encrypted USB drive with a password manager file on it. That USB I also have a copy (just in case) and keep it in another place.  
Another way is to encrypt that wallet and save the wallet file into a USB drive too. I see that you already did that (2FA + password) and that is enough to keep your wallet safe. Now you can just copy only the wallet file onto a USB and even can delete it from your PC. I use to have a USB with many different wallets and access them through a Tail OS boot USB anytime I want, from any PC. I always travel with a copy of that USB drive encrypted (password protected), so no matter I am I have with my BTC. I f I lose that USB, I have many copies and even 3-4 NAS remote accessible.   
Electrum is really great wallet. That wallet file you can even open it into your mobile with Electrum mobile version. Same wallet, same password, same labels, all great.

But seriously now, how a bank is "investing" in a company? Do they come with a armored truck full of cash or just a simple IOU paper (worthless anyway) ? I think this is the most important question: a bank can create anytime a IOU paper, they cost them nothing. But if X person want to fund a company with money that doesn't have, physically, will have to come up with another IOU from a bank that guarantee the X person to have those IOU money.  
So actually BBVA didn't give to Coinbase any real money. So what is the deal in this case? What was the promise or push from BBVA to Coinbase, because is very important to know for the security of Coinbase.  
I know Coinbase will never answer my questions, they are too cowards for this and they have the bankster's gun behind their head. But that doesn't make them not responsible for what is next.  
Just see how many are downvoting my question because I said the word "banksters", that say it all.

Bitcoin doesn't need any country. Is borderless and unstoppable. You need just some patience.  
I wonder if you earn your bitcoins or you just buy them. If you want to make Bitcoin better, start working for bitcoins and close your bank accounts (as I did more than a year ago). That will make fiat (govs/banksters instrument) to be every day worthless.  
Your intention to have people registering to your project is more like what the govs want: a Bitcoin users database. Bitcoin need/have to be anonymous, otherwise is losing his mean.

Yeah, just a week ago I was talking with an old friend about Bitcoin and world economy in general. He's a bitcoiner too but he was a skeptic until 2014. I was telling him about BTC from 2011 when I jumped in but he considered me crazy.  
Once he saw my one of my first income (from work) in BTC, he was like punched in the head and wake up. Then he asked me to give him more information and material to read and he get really into BTC, buying steady monthly as far he can.  
So last week just told me that now he realized that all this time he was in a dark cloud, not seeing what's really happening and he really thank me for insisting to wake him up.  
Imagine how many other people are like him... and they will be all victims of the fucking banksters...

"En cambio, el Bitcoin, es simple. El valor se lo da los usuarios, entre más se utilice, más valdrá, llegará a 21 millones de Bitcoin, no más, no menos. Lo que provoca automáticamente una suerte de solidaridad entre nosotros; obviamente si veo un comercio que acepta BTC, voy, porque sé, como usuaria, que si le va bien a él, a mi también. No solo porque el BTC suba. Sino, porque estamos tomando parte de nuestra soberanía. Parece presuntuoso, no es que quiera ser una nación independiente, es que, al menos yo, quiero dejar atrás el Banco Central, el FMI, BCE y quedarme tranquilita, con mis bloques, aprendiendo a usar bien mi monedero ( cosa que aún no consigo) formar parte de éste mundo Bitcoinero que cada día me encandila con algo nuevo y soñar con una moneda que no tiene un control central, ni lobbies, ni usa guerras para aumentar su valor."

We already mined more than 17 millions BTC from the total of 21. That means that from no on the race of getting some BTC will be veeeery hard. The time when everybody wants to give you free information on how to get BTC and even give you some satoshis is over. From 2015 when I start being paid in BTC I stopped giving away free satoshis, tips and free advice. Now all my friends or people that ask me about BTC are paying me in BTC for my advice.

I leave a "default" empty wallet file where is saved in user profile. Then I took my wallet file, rename it and save it wherever I want it. When I open Electrum I select Open wallet from where I save it and done. Next time Electrum will open the last open file location.  
You can use as many wallets you want and each will open in a new session of Electrum.

Save those 12 words that are the passphrase for your wallet, in a safe place, like a password manager kept on an encrypted USB stick.  
Also put a PIN to open and/or spend transactions.

Another "Coinbase" ?  
Because the reason why a bank want to throw some fake money into a Bitcoin company is that they want to control something. A bank never care about investing for profit, they invest to have a piece of control.  
For a bank it's easy to make a IOU paper where it says: I will give you 1million fiat shit in your account to be part of your company. Even the paper cost more than that million fake money.  
And then the profit come from the control... in form of more control...  
So yeah will be interesting to follow this move.  
Good catch, thanks for sharing!

The best way to "make profit" with Bitcoin is to use it to buy/sell things and HODL it. Learning more about Bitcoin will give more knowledge and advantages over other people so again more profit. Create something with/for/around Bitcoin will bring you a way more profitable in the future. Knowledge is the power.

We already have a P2P decentralized exchange: Bitsquare.io. You are always in control of your funds.  
Yes I know many will downvote this because many here are making money from you guys that are using centralized/regulated/normal exchanges and in the end you get nothing because of those hacks/breaches.  
With a P2P decentralized exchange you will never lose money, because the exchange is not safe enough, but because the exchange will never keep your funds!  
BTW a P2P exchange also will never ask you for those stupid invasive KYC/AML. Those are not to protect you, but to incriminate you.

- all these BS AML rules are to scare people NOT to use cryptos and this a sign that EU banksters are scared the shit out of them because of Bitcoin  
- soon many peoples from EU will use more and more BTC just because this:   
If you want to buy BTC, start using [Bitsquare]( exchange (P2P decentralized) or localbitcoins, or Mycelium local trader or just start working for bitcoins.

Exactly, only idiots will say that they can't secure their own controlled wallets. They deserved to be hacked for their stupidity.
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:40:35
I use to have/use 5 mobile wallets and on desktop 2 types and each with 3-4 wallets. Hardware just for HODL coins.  
But each of my wallets contain several addresses (some vanity too) dedicated each for a specific type of use.  
I live on BTC for more than a year so for me the management of my bitcoins is important. Is like I am really my own bank.  
I have 2-3 specific BTC addresses dedicated for incomes only. These addresses regularly I shapeshift them. I never spend directly from those income BTC. When I shapeshift them I usually spread the original ammount into 3-4-5 different wallets/addresses, for specific spends I need. From those spending addresses I also send some to HODL addresses.  
So for each type of spends I use a different wallet. Mobile wallets for quick spends, small amounts, desktop wallets (controlling addresses) for large spends.  
I use Electrum on mobile and desktop with the same wallet file, that helps me to label txs or addresses.  
I use also Mycelium for paying bills with cashila and this same wallet also I use it into Electrum sometimes, to organize the change addresses.  
**Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank**  
For the record: gov will never have access to my wallets. NEVER! If they want to tax my BTC they have to come up with their own proves. I give them shit.

Don't you get it?  
The whole "hack operation" in fact was an undercover.  
Is the same scenario like with "war against terrorism":  
- create the problem  
- attacks, kills, bombs etc BS  
- wait for people reaction - media blow out, people are angry, gov is not doing anything, what a disaster etc  
- come up with the solution (that actually was already prepared before) - more restrictions to YOU the simple user   
**Always is the same scenario: problem - reaction - solution**. And always this happen exactly when something else more important is happening, to move your attention from it.  
Just think a bit: Qui bono? And the answer is: many but not YOU.  
This wasn't a random "heist", this was a very well organized/prepared operation, but not to "hack"... to prepare the minds of fools to believe the story.

Nope, I even not use bitsquare, because I am paid in BTC. But Bitsquare is the only best option right now. Is not spamming, is waking up people. My mom is using it to buy only.

Yes of course can be considered like a "transition" but promoting them is like promoting VISA services, means promoting banksters services. Many people will take this "promotional video" like the ultimate solution and will not look into using his own BTC wallet as much is possible.  
Instead of fighting to get out from the fiat slavery we are getting into a loop: BTC-fiat-BTC-fiat etc that will never end the shit we are living today (because of banksters).

**EXACTLY! Well said!** I was saying the same all the time, here, and immediately the "traders/gamblers" jump on me. When I told them that is about time that they will lose everything they laugh.  
The Bitcoin Revolution will not be made by traders/gamblers, but by real bitcoiners!  
I am happy too that this happen and I hope that many other people will wake up and realize that gambling with Bitcoin to get rich quickly is a huge risk.  
Best explanation here (from Andreas):   
And an advice (again) for noobs: **use a damn P2P decentralized exchange like Bitsquare.io** do not fall into traders "advice" to use centralized exchanges like Coinbase and others. On Bitsquare.io you are **always** in control of your funds, no verification, no hacks, no tracking. And use it just to buy/sell BTC and/or other altcoins, not for "trading". Even the bitqsuare wallet is yours, and the exchange doesn't have control of that wallet, just for escrow.

People wake up, all these "bitcoin debit cards" are a nonsense, there is no such thing "bitcoin debit card" because Bitcoin can't be debited!
These "cards" are just a nice way to steal your bitcoins and leave you with the worthless fiat.
Just imagine the following scenario: you give them your BTC (because effectively you give them the keys) and they put some digits (not real money) into your debit card. Now you are sheeple thinking that you are using your bitcoins but in fact not.
Then the fun game coming. You are dancing around with that shit card but one day the banks ATMs will be closed and merchants also will not be able to make visa payments. Then you realized that YOU ARE FUCKED! All your BTC are in that company wallets, gone and you remain with the goat shit fiat into a useless card.
HAHAHAHA! I will laugh to all those sheeple that let their BTC in the hands of new banksters: "Bitcoin Debit Card".
Now you will say that this scenario will never happen, gov and banks will take care of us and that is too big to fail etc BS.... I have news for you guys, this will happen very soon. MARK MY WORDS...

Let's not forget that those "cards" are VISA/MC fiat cards, so nothing to "help" Bitcoin. Really don't understand why people are so "excited" about these cards. These cards have NOTHING to do with Bitcoin, are just making banksters pockets bigger then are.  
All "bitcoin debit cards" are in fact fiat cards, I mean worthless goat shit fiat.  
Bitcoin will never "back" a credit card and will never be a "debit card". You own bitcoins, you can't debit them. You do not own them you cannot spend them. Simple like that.  
A credit card = money created from nothing, money that you are paying later with taxes (forget about interest, that is nothing).  
**Bitcoin  = money that you cannot spend it if you do not own it**  
More than this:  
**There is NO such thing of "bitcoin debit cards"!**  
Those cards are fiat cards, linked to a bank account, linked to your name, linked to all your shopping, linked to all your movements...  
Those cards are created EXACTLY to slow down the full adoption of Bitcoin and keep you chained to their fiat and bank accounts.  
Do not fall into this trap of banksters!  
A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them. The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Going back to plastic cards use, is going back to slavery masters...

If you still think that your vote will help a side or another and that side will do something for you, you are a fool. Politicians are put in place by banksters. Point and clear. The rest is just an illusion of freedom, illusion of democracy.

I pay bills through Mycelium-Cashila link. The rent I pay it also directly to the landlord, wallet to wallet. It's really cool.
The rest direct payments with BTC to merchants. It's up to you to find them, they are there I can assure you, but many do not promote too much their BTC acceptance.  
The only thing that is a bit hassle is the income wage payment. The employer pays always to a dedicated BTC address and that one I have to shapeshift it all the time to lose track of it.
@_date: 2016-04-07 15:10:00
From now on is not so difficult to live only with BTC.  
All starts with being paid in BTC, then pay your rent in BTC, then find places and convince more merchants to accept BTC.  
Cashila.com, bitwa.la, bitbill.eu are just few services that gives you a simple way to live on BTC. The rest come by themselves. You just have to look closer.

Each country, state, region, community will have an own coin, backed by a specific amount of bitcoins.  
Bitcoin can't be an universal currency, that is just a dream.

I don't know WHO created that bot and what is really doing. In Bitcoin world is better do not trust anybody.  
Just an example: 2 years ago I was checking to create my own .bit domain. I had it created but one day a smart guy posted here a page where people can "create" their .bit domain paying a fee to him. So I wanted to see if his "services" see my already created .bit domain so I check in his "search available" box. It appear to be free so he offer to register it for me. But the domain was already in function and even with a page.  
So when the domain was expired, I didn't want it anymore, was just a play test, but suddenly the domain was take... by the same page where I was checking it before...  
So I don't trust anymore these "checking" balance, domains etc are just stealing info.

First read this:  so you will have an idea about what is going on here. I am just a simple guy trying to fight with those elements and yes sometimes I can sound a bit crazy (because I am angry).  
I have 100% confidence in BTC because I hate so much the banksters, that ruined my life years ago. Bitcoin is my savior.  
I was very skeptic too back in 2010-2011 when I heard first time about BTC, like many others from here. But what makes me to be confident, was reading a lot about Bitcoin, watching many speakers (some of them just pumpers/dumpers) to see opinions and arguments. And one by one the arguments makes me to believe that Bitcoin can fix a lot of things that are not working in our actual system. Many things.  
Many people see in Bitcoin just an instrument of getting rich quick, but rich in fiat. That's a total BS.  
I see Bitcoin far more than just a financial instrument, is a total disruptor of actual system (that is rotten), and this is giving me hope.  
That's why I decided to be part of Bitcoin Revolution (disruption) by closing all my bank accounts and never use their fiat anymore. I use exclusively BTC for all my incomes and spending. And I live free.

Currency = trade money in exchange for better prices

Maybe those who you tried to explain are these ?   
I always took the approach in the reverse way: make the Bitcoin to be more valuable and the fiat like shit.  
I convinced a director of a company to pay me in BTC after I burned in front of his eyes a 50€ bill, saying that the shity bill worth nothing to me and I will appreciate if he will start paying my services in BTC. Next month I get my service invoices paid in BTC directly to my wallet.  
And this is the truth, people are blind and not see the true value of Bitcoin: FREEDOM. People are used to choose the candy bar instead of silver/gold bar...  
Another good quote:   
Also a great quote of Andreas: "Satoshi took the power of creating money from banks and give it to the people". If somebody didn't understand what does it mean this phrase is really dumb and no worth to discuss anymore. Here is the quote:

Is your right to be wrong. OB is not ebay. And thats the secret and the beauty with it.  
Think of it like you have some goods to sell (vegetables) and you go to your local store market, pull out your selling table/box/whatever shelf and start selling your goods. From 9 to 17:00. Then you pack all your goods and table/box/whatever and go home.  
Next day is another day for market...  
This is the P2P selling not letting your goods in hands of a distributor that gather from all producers and distribute them all around the world.  
You sell FRESH goods 1 day only in a BAZAAR.  
This is Open Bazaar and people really forget how goods was sold in history: P2P in bazaar markets.

I have a xapo account with a platic card associated too. The card is not issued by them.  
All works just fine but I don't keep too much BTC on that wallet. I don't need to. If I need to spend with the plastic card, I just have to move from my personal wallets some coins to the xapo wallet. The conversion is done in the moment you pay with the card. Nothing remain in the card balance.  
I have this xapo/card just for extremely rare cases  when I need to pay with fiat. The rest I use my wallets to pay only in BTC.  
They have also a vault system to keep your coins offline from the wallet, but I prefer to have my own vault (hardware wallets).  
Always keep in mind this 
@_date: 2016-04-15 16:18:45
The fact that only one person can't create money is not a real problem, because nobody took that right from you.  
Instead with fiat money, you don't have the right to create your own money or you go to jail, but some banksters can create endless money and don't go to jail...  
This is the most important thing: the power to create money that nobody can take it from you. Nobody can stop you to create your own mining farm.

Yeah I saw many times Andreas talking about “The Other 6 Billion” or the 6 billion people who do not have access to financial services.  
But my humble question to Andreas is: how do you make those 6 billion  people to use BTC if normally they survive with $1/day and they will have to pay a BTC tx fee of 5 or 30 cents just to buy a bread for their entire family?  
I see many here saying "bleah, 20 cents fee to send hundreds of BTC"... but they are not giving a shit about that other people on the other side of the planet will have to give away their daily bread just to be able to send a tx.

I don't want to pay any form of "bailout". They lost, he wins, this is the life. Bitcoin is NOT the fiat central banking. We shouldn't do anything, otherwise we create a huge precedent and then the whole Bitcoin idea fall down. This precedent is EXACTLY what banksters are waiting (or maybe they already plan it). To see how Bitcoin is falling from inside.  
No, fuck them! They lost because they didn't respect the only one rule that matters in Bitcoinlandia: You control the keys, it is your bitcoins. If you don't control your keys, is not your bitcoins.  
Let the police to investigate, is their job to catch the bad guys. If they can't catch them, should be a lesson for everybody!

Only an idiot can think like that. A "hack" of an exchange is not a hack on Bitcoin protocol. "Faith" was never shaken and now is stronger than anytime.  
And I don't consider that was a real hack. A hack is involving a lot of things to do.  
They let some doors open and somebody enter and find the keys. So the Bitcoin protocol it wasn't affected in any way but in fact worked as it was designed: **If you own the keys, you own the bitcoins. When you don't own anymore the keys, you lost your bitcoins.**  
Articles like these makes me think that there is more that we don't know. And one thing is that this alleged "hack" was an inside job with help from gov agents, with the goal of "shaking the faith" of new users...   
**Qui bono?**  
Who knows, maybe even Coinbase agents (aka gov agents) are involved in "hacking" Bitfinex, actually they stole their clients in the last reveals of who really is Coinbase...

Yes, I agree that we still do not see prices only in BTC, but continuing to use fiat products is like letting to bleed continuously. We have to be inventive in find ways to avoid fiat payments in any form.  
Yes, I agree that I have a "strong" attitude against fiat because they ruined me years ago and Bitcoin is my salvation. Somebody have to be the "rant guy", otherwise nobody will hear the other side of things, will be like just the MSM news, all people believe that things are just like on TV...    
But those cards are NOT a BTC-backed solution, but a trap. If you think a bit more, neutrally, you will realize that those plastic cards are created NOT to help you a bitcoin supporter but to help VISA/MC/Banksters to take your BTC and give you worthless goat shit fiat in exchange, to keep you in line into their slavery system.

Greeks can be helped by buying their products and services DIRECTLY WITH BTC, to skip the step of exchanging euro to btc.  
An btc atm in greece is just a furniture, nobody will use it because they are still limited to use euros.  
BUY THEIR PRODUCTS IN BTC!

Taxation is theft. I hope in some years Bitcoin will take over and somebody smart will make an invention based on blockchain technology that will create a social community wallet for common expenses. At a local level, region level and country level. So people can support those social wallets by their own will and generosity and also participants to have a direct vote on what they are going to do with those money.  
That will exclude a lot of unnecessary expenses like: military complexes, wars, corruption, worthless gov projects, tyranny, spying programs etc.  
Just an example (there are tons of others) of unnecessary expenses

YES! This is gentlemen! Good answer man!  
Is not stupid at all man. I closed all my bank accounts more than a year ago and now I live only on BTC.

@_date: 2016-04-12 12:27:16
Good luck with that. Only lazy and ignorant people will let their BTC address to be linked with their identity.  
I always have a vanity address that I use it for "public records" and tons of others that will never will be linked with my real identity.  
There are many ways to lose track of used addresses, even entirely.  
This is a title to scare the noobs that doesn't have interest to dig enough and know better how to use Bitcoin.  
I'm not encouraging illegal activities but I'm encouraging PRIVACY and in special financial privacy from my gov.  
I will always have 1-2 addresses that I will use them and publicly linked with my name and that is enough for my gov to know. The rest is not their damn business. They have to live with that from now on...
@_date: 2016-04-12 10:38:17
Yes nice answer. But you choose to TRADE BTC not to live on BTC.  
What will happen if all Estonians (or majority) will demand to be paid in BTC from their jobs? The gov will put them all in jail? That will never happen and gov will never stop you to use (not trade) BTC, because they can't stop you to use it.  
I think many people start in a wrong way with Bitcoin. Many consider BTC a currency (that is designed to speculate) and not MONEY (that is designed to trade for goods and services). If we start using it like simple money NOBODY can stop you.  
I know is a hard process, but everything have a start.
@_date: 2016-04-12 20:49:20
Merchant adoption will come when they will see that there are a lot of bitcoins to be spent.  
Merchant adoption start when people will demand to be paid in BTC.  
Right now is only greed of speculators.  
If we stop thinking only in that bitcoin is a currency that we can speculate the price and will start thinking that Bitcoin = Money then the adoption will come quick.  
I live on BTC, I am paid in BTC, I spend in BTC and I hold what remains, but I don't consider to speculate with BTC, I just use it like money. Freedom money.  
Satoshi did a something great for humanity: he took the power of creating money from the masters banksters and give it to the people (slaves/monkeys). Now the "monkeys" are playing with this toy but they don't really understand what they have in hands: POWER, FREEDOM MONEY.  
Will take a while until the monkeys will wake up and I hope will not be too late.

Yeah really doesn't make sense these BS "Bitcoin debit cards". Using bitwala to receive your salary in fiat to exchange it into btc, then exchange it back to fiat using these shit cards, is a total waste of time and money.  
People wake up, all these "bitcoin debit cards" are a nonsense, there is no such thing "bitcoin debit card" because Bitcoin can't be debited!  
These "cards" are just a nice way to steal your bitcoins and leave you with the worthless fiat.  
Just imagine the following scenario: you give them your BTC (because effectively you give them the keys) and they put some digits (not real money) into your debit card. Now you are sheeple thinking that you are using your bitcoins but in fact not.  
Then the fun game coming. You are dancing around with that shit card but one day the banks ATMs will be closed and merchants also will not be able to make visa payments. Then you realized that YOU ARE FUCKED! All your BTC are in that company wallets, gone and you remain with the goat shit fiat into a useless card.  
HAHAHAHA! I will laugh to all those sheeple that let their BTC in the hands of new banksters: "Bitcoin Debit Card".  
Now you will say that this scenario will never happen, gov and banks will take care of us and that is too big to fail etc BS.... I have news for you guys, this will happen very soon. MARK MY WORDS...
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:00:43

Cointelegraph have quite creepy pictures.  
In a previous article they make Andreas to look like a creepy FBI agent Cooper (Twin Peaks). Yeah a Bitcoin speaker being an FBI agent is kind of sick joke...  
Now we see Andreas like a waiter giving to Sir Bitcoin a golden fork. And the Sir Bitcoin is eating the banksters heart and drinking govs blood.  
These pics are really bad interpretation or they put them with a specific reason...

Most of people (bitcoiners) read first about how wallets work, types and then use bitcoins.  
If you already imported the private keys into Electrum, you should be able to move them anywhere you want.  
You have no idea because you are lazy and don't want to read and teach yourself. There is plenty of documentation about wallets, just start reading.
@_date: 2016-04-23 07:50:45
Hahaha now they realize that they are out?! Oh I have news for you politician guys, wait until Bitcoin will kick you out from those nice chairs, because soon we will not need you anymore.

Yes but is one of the best speeches that any noob should watch first.  
Maybe we should post every day one speech of Andreas just for new comers. Like Monday questions let's have Wednesday videos. And the noobs should make comments and ask questions about what they listen from those videos. The rest of us (olders) we can just answer their questions.

So you didn't import the private keys from core wallet. Again you didn't read about how to use the wallet.  
You import only the public key (btc address) not the private keys!  
Man, if you don't read you will never be able to use bitcoins and worst... you will lost them.

Liquidity of what? Of illusions? We already have 17 millions of bitcoin mined, generated, in use. We are just fine with that.  
Free markets are not driven by speculators or liquidity but by demand and offer of goods and services. The price of those goods and services are determined by demand and offer of those goods and services not by speculators.  
We don't need speculators to tell us to use Bitcoin, we just use it like money.

@_date: 2016-04-18 08:18:27
I think you misunderstood how Bitcoin works.  
Your bitcoins (not coins) always will stay on the blockchain. Bitcoins are tokens. Your wallet actually is a key chain holder  to access those bitcoins.   
You own those bitcoins as long as you are the owner and in control of those keys.  
TIP: You are no longer in control of your keys, you don't own the bitcoins.  
To have a backup of your bitcoins access is enough to have a backup of your private keys (not public ones):  
- paper wallet - a QR code with your private keys  
- a HD passphrase - 12-13 english words generated by your wallet  
- a copy of your encrypted wallet file  
- a hardware wallet that stores your private keys  
More details read on the right panel the getting started -------------------&gt;

Yeah man, you are right that is a transition phase. But from my point of view (living on BTC) I see this like a trap. People will get used with these cards and will start to forget that the main reason of Bitcoin is to not get back to banks. As I said: in some day people will start crying because they can't use those cards - banks will limit withdrawals or close atms.  
Yes you are right, these cards is better to use them little by little, but you know that people are quite dumb and will not do that. Will take the candy bar instead of the silver bar like in this video

I use to have Mycelium on my mobile and Electrum on desktop with the same seed/addresses. But yes I imported the seed long time ago, not sure if now with the new version is working the same.  
Now I can see/work with all addresses generated/used.  
Also the Wiper mobile app with BTC wallet have a seed that can be imported into Electrum desktop. Works fine.  
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:52:12
So your vault actually is NOT a vault. Is just another wallet where you keep another key. So useless, I can do that with many other wallets, without "linking" my identity to Clonebase wallets... that will end up in gov hands...

1. Your bitcoins will never "get out" from Electrum wallet. Your bitcoins are and will be always on the Blockchain. Electrum is just an app where you store your keys to access your bitcoins.  
2. When you activate 2FA, that doesn't mean your keys are backed up by that 2FA, you just put another layer of security to access your keys.  
3. Like any wallet or Electrum wallet, once you create it, first thing to do is: copy your passphrase seed into a password manager (offline, not dropbox/whatever cloud storage) and also all related info with that wallet (QR codes to restore the 2FA, password for encrypted wallet, private keys etc).  
I use these 2: [Efficient password manager -free]( and [KeePass]( (this one also has mobile version). Both are offline (not storing data on 3rd party servers) and you control it easy, just 1 file to save and carry on an encrypted USB.  
4. If you have saved those 12 words passphrase, those are your keys (apart from the real private keys, in case you save them too). Electrum can restore from both, passphrase or private keys.  
I suggest to all noobs to save on an encrypted USB and password manager all information about all wallets/accounts related to their bitcoins. An USB stick with 2-3 other copies, stored in a safe place.  
5. [How to encrypt USB drive](  
Keep on this USB drive: backup wallet files (encrypted with password to open) and password manager file backup, containing all your info about your wallets  
Also for those more "advanced", buy your own NAS (network area storage) and setup to be accessible anytime. I use to have 2-3 NAS placed fully accessible from desktop/mobile with backups of all my wallets (encrypted).

Cashila is generating just an internal reference for your payment. What's stop me to use a dedicated BTC wallet just for those payments? And in case there will be a leak from cashila, what will see the gov agents? Just a BTC address? They can kiss my ass, but they can never close, seize, track my bank accounts like they do now with regular bank accounts.  
That's why it says: Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank! Because you are the banker for your own money!
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:06:56
Nope. I give them BTC to pay my bills, not fiat. Is not my problem what they are doing with those BTC, are not mine anymore and I don't have to use any bank account in my name. That is all that matter for me.  
A shit card will always be in your name and will be tracked back to you. I don't want that anymore. FUCK THE BANKS!

Another fiat trap:   
Currency USD and HKD...   
yeah give away your precious BTC to them so they can give you shity fiat. No way!  
I can pay with my BTC wallet why should I go back to that plastic cards that trace every move I did?  
These "debit cards" are a big lie for bitcoiners, are created just to slow down the BTC adoption! If a merchant is not well informed that can accept easily BTC and can accept these cards will never adopt BTC and people will be again trapped into the existing banking system. This is a BIG LIE! We have to get rid of banks and their obsolete system!  
Bitcoin is the future!

Use exclusively BTC and all your privacy concerns are gone.  
Demand to be paid in BTC and not use exchanges. We have enough 17 millions of BTC in circulation.  
Pay with your BTC wallet and not with VISA.  
Don't wait for you fucking gov to say: hey please use Bitcoin for your own safety... that will never happen.

There is no such thing of "bitcoin debit cards". Are just fiat debit cards. Bitcoin can't be "debited".  
Stop believing/trusting in these cards, are just an illusion of using Bitcoin. You are giving away your precious bitcoins in exchange for fiat, so you are back to slavery...  
And I will give you just one example: you put your money into these cards but if the ATMs are blocked or shut down (because the banks can do that without notice - see Greece) you will not be able to use them. Instead your own BTC wallet you can always can use it and nobody can stop you to do that.  
Banks, on whatever form they are (fiat or bitcoin) are a friction point where you don't have control of your money. Never.

Yes Bitcoin is global and for that ALWAYS we have to think also at global level and not only in USD but in satoshis.  
I wonder what Andreas A. had in mind when he always said that Bitcoin will bank the billions of unbanked...  
If we will not make the fees to tend to 1 satoshi but to 1 million satoshi, the unbanked will remain the same like now. I'm not saying that Bitcoin will erase the poverty, but neither will penetrate into those worlds with 1 million satoshi fee.
@_date: 2016-04-23 08:04:04
I use many wallets (mobile and desktop) but to check them I just have to open my wallet, takes 2 secs and also I can see more than 1 address at the time. To check on another places I have to copy the address from a separate source and then open the app/page and paste the address. That takes more than 2 secs and I can check only 1 address at a time. So it's useless.
@_date: 2016-04-12 09:30:52
Stop using the damn Clonebase.  
Demand to be paid in BTC and use your BTC wallet.  
You can start receiveing your incomes with bitwage.com or cashila.com or bitwa.la (these 2 also you can pay your bills with BTC).  
There are so many options out there that you don't need the fucking Clonebase.

Make your own wallet. Clonebase is not the best way to start with BTC.  
  
My 12yr daughter create her own Electrum wallet, link it to her online shop (selling girl stuff) and receive directly into her wallet BTC.  
Nobody can stop using your own wallet. Clonebase is not an option. If you want to buy better use a atm or mycelium trade. But for you better start earning some btc. You can sell stuff on Open Bazaar or Bitify.

Andreas A. was right all the time when he says that Bitcoin is a disruptive technology on all aspects of society. Bitcoin is a cleaner...
Next step: making obsolete the politicians and banksters.
This is just the beginning.

I really don't understand why US people not start using bitwage and they stupid enough to use the trap Coinbase (or should I say Clonebase, they are cloning your identity with their data collection) ?

From Jan 2015 I start being paid full in BTC.  
I closed all my bank accounts in Mar 2015.  
I spend in BTC from what I earn monthly an hold what remains.  
What I mined in the early days I still have it not moved :) those are hold for my daughter, to secure her future.  
I live on BTC and I am a free man!

@_date: 2016-04-07 09:10:08
Geeze you are really nuts to keep that fortune on an online wallet.  
  
I have:  
- 50% in a "picture wallet" (a form to hide the 12 words passphrase in a normal picture), but you can have this on a hardware wallet too (ledger, trezor, passkey etc are many now)  
- 40% desktop wallet - Electrum and Multibit  
- 9% mobile wallets: Airbitz, Mycelium, Blockchain, Wiper and the famous first Bitcoin wallet for mobiles from Andreas S.   
- 1% Xapo wallet linked with a VISA card (extreme cases use)  
Nothing kept on online wallets, exchanges etc. All mine.
@_date: 2016-04-07 15:05:07
Some things you can't do it or is not good to do it with Bitcoin. So in order to do that thing, you will need a specific altcoin that you can buy only with a specific amount of bitcoins.  
You will see that soon, mark my words.
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:49:49
Don't you get it? Coinbase is a banskter's tool that fool people to get into BTC, but in fact just spy on them and take their BTC and give back the goat shit fiat.  
  
But yes US people are used to be dumb like these  choosing a candy bar instead of a silver bar, so they choose coinbase bar instead of bitwage or any other exchange or just keep their BTC in their wallet.

You want BTC? Work for, demand to be paid in BTC, is the best easy way to obtain it.  
Once you receive them it's easy to lose trace of those addresses you used.  
OB was not designed only for you to buy BTC. It was designed to be an open marketplace with tons of products.  
OB will work just fine without you.
@_date: 2016-04-08 08:23:59
You don't have any imagination.  
Using ONLY bitwage to exchange your fiat to BTC, will be the only place where you put your details.  
Once you have your BTC in your wallet (not Bitwage) you can make them disappear to any other addresses (I use shapeshift to move them into an altcoin then back to a new address in my wallet).  
If you are so scared with giving your info, demand to be paid ONLY in BTC directly, but even then you have to lose track of the coins you received because the same address will be linked to you when your salary is sent.  
More info you give when you use fiat with credit cards not when you use it with your BTC wallet.  
EDIT: and Bitwage is not a banksters tool, like Coinbase 
@_date: 2016-04-07 14:55:30
I really don't care about the BTC price in fiat. That is history for me.  
Check the buying value of $1 from 1913 until now. You will see that what 1$ could buy in 1920 now you have to pay 10 or 20 times more.  
That's because from 1913 when the banksters cartel start creating their own money and fool us all (remember the Jeckyll Island).  
Now with BTC the situation is in OUR hands not in their hands and more than that BTC IS LIMITED. I see that people forget this very important thing.  
BTC limitation to 21 millions will make that in time the value of 1 satoshi will increase exponentially.  
Remember the pizaa guy?   The guy that paid 10k BTC (not satoshis) for only 2 pizzas? And wasn't so far ago... just in 2010.
@_date: 2016-04-23 18:30:04
The difference between an old bitcoiner and a new one:  
- the old one is not giving away/tipping bitcoins, because he value them more [(see the case of 10k btc/2 pizzas)](  
- the new one is tipping all around and giving away, thinking that more people will listen and use bitcoin like him.  
Both they should giving away fiat and hold btc...

You are wrong. When I pay bills I pay them through cashila. I give them BTC not fiat. What they do with those BTC, I don't care, is not my problem. But I never use a bank account in my name.  
When I pay to a merchant I give them BTC directly to their BTC wallet, so is not my problem if they are too dumb to exchange those in fiat.  
Only idiots will use a 3rd party service to receive BTC payments. To accept BTC payments you just have to present a QR code from your BTC wallet you don't need a 3rd party to do that.
@_date: 2016-08-19 11:22:58

I'm like you. I live on BTC and I consider that is too valuable every satoshi so I decided to not tip or give away in any way or at least I will get back something. Before I closed my bank accounts I was giving away or burn fiat bills just to show to others that fiat is goat shit.  
OK there was a time when I was listening a guy singing with his guitar in a metro station and I was giving him every time some bits, but that was in exchange for his nice songs, I was paying him for his services. Sadly I didn't see him anymore in that station.  
But Bitcoin will still go on don't worry. People just need patience and all things will be sorted.

Great! Finally I see some move from Spain. I think Spanish people should be more involved into Bitcoin Revolution. And I think also that this kind of articles in spanish can help a lot. The language barrier in Spain, is keeping them to adopt Bitcoin.  
I was recently talking with a friend/client from Spain and I was suggesting to use Bitcoin for his business. We are in 2016 and he still didn't hear/know nothing about Bitcoin! And is a well educated person, but you see all news about Bitcoin are in English and he and others like him don't read news in English. Language barrier.  
So Cointelegraph.es please write more articles in Spanish and spread the word. Spain need Bitcoin.

That's why some publishers are against Brave, because they know will lose their us eless jobs.

Even Mycelium wallet keys can be used on desktop. You can import them in Electrum desktop and done.  
I think Electrum mobile is not really polished yet, but works fine. You can also open the desktop wallet file into mobile version so you can skip the sync if you have many txs.

A free and healthy market is not based on speculations of the value of a currency, is based on demand and offer of goods and services.  
The speculations comes later when some lazy bastards think they are smarter then those who work hard to create goods and services.  
For example nowadays we see the price of grains driven by speculators greed not by production amount and demand of consumers. And for that we see farmers and producers that they are literally giving away their production of grains because some speculators are fucking up all the prices. And are many families of producers/farmers that are starving or just surviving because of a smart ass that is playing with their lives.  
This is not free market, this slavery market.  
Exactly the same is with playing with BTC price, when a speculator wins because he played "well" on the speculation market, somebody on the other side of the planet died because of a loss.  
Speculation IS NOT FREE MARKET.  
A perfect example of how speculators always lose

Don't reply or trust too much these services. Are the friction point with the banks, where you are back to tracking.  
I have a Xapo card (actually is not issued by Xapo but by a 3rd party) that is not keeping any funds. The exchange is made instantly when you make the purchase, from your xapo btc wallet. So you don't need to load funds into this card in order to spend. Just move some coins into your xapo wallet.  
But I use this card very few times, I keep it only for extreme cases and for small amounts. Never withdraw cash and never pay large amounts.  
Nowadays you can pay directly with your BTC wallet almost anywhere. I live on BTC so for me these cards are temporary and make no sense.  
I pay bills with cashila and I spend most of my BTC online  I pay the rent directly in BTC to my landlord and I buy my groceries from a local shop in BTC.

Great article. Yes totally agree. I was talking with a lot of people about Bitcoin, but very few really understand the first thing that you started with: "Where Does Money Come From?"  
And people are really stupid and have NO idea how to answer this. Every time I start a discussion about Bitcoin with somebody, I start with this question. Seriously only 5-10% will have a good answer.  
And this starts from EDUCATION and willing to be well informed. Ignorant people will be always the last ones that will use Bitcoin.  
I start teaching my daughter about money, economy and Bitcoin because she is our future. If our kids are not well informed and educated, our future is doomed. We will have a generation of "Idiocracy".  
If you go to see what they teach kids about money and economy you are going to shoot yourself in your foot. Nothing, nothing good and only lies and BS. They are simply brainwashed.

Then we will invent the Bitcoin offline. Like Charlie Shrem said they created in jail a bitcoin blockchain system on notebooks that tracks the debts between inmates. I can't find not that talk with Charlie but I remember it back in 2014 or 2015.  
So each user will have his own notebook/blockchain where will take not of each tx to be recorded. And any other person will have a copy of that book.  
Yeah of course you will come and say that this is impossible at large scale. Yes is true, but also don't underestimate the ingenuity of a human... Definitely will be invented something.

Is not so important to return those funds but to re use them. Moving back and forward the funds is not so practical for small amounts. If you can have a system like: failed send, keep the funds and generate a key that can be reused for another fax, the the user receive by email or on screen that key, save it and next time have the option to put the key to re-use the funds.

People should understand that each altcoin have his own properties, functionalities, destination and role. And NONE of them can replace Bitcoin or another crypto, only if will have the same properties etc...  
So when you look at a crypto you should better look at a comparison chart between each other to see what is doing/or not each coin and then choose the one you want for a specific role.  
An example: you find a product/service/property that you can obtain it only with a specific coin? Fine, mine/obtain/earn some bitcoins and then go to shapeshift.io and exchange your BTC for that altcoin and buy you desired product.  
At the end will exist a lot of altcoins and is good to be like that. I love to see each country to have own CountryCoin backed by Bitcoin, so the people of that country will deal with their own coin internally and if they need international tx will use BTC.  
Let's stop this nonsense of pumping and dumping of all cryptos, it's silly and really hurts us all in the end.

I had a better "experience" than you. I had also quite some txs but I always use 1k satoshi fee for many years. And always my txs went through just fine.  
But you saw many "screaming" about how to increase your fee, because those screaming are from greedy miners. They are quite afraid of the halvening so now they try to deceive users to increase their fees so miners can cover their future loses. And we don't talk about those rewards for the empty blocks...  
Don't feed the greedy miners with higher fees, they will never stop in requesting more and more. The network will not be more secure with higher fees.

If you start with ignoring FAQ and guides you will end up losing all you have. And this is the best advice you can get first. Take your time and read all info you can get and don't rush. There is plenty of documentation on internet now, we are not in 2009...  
If you like I can give you full consulting in your issues and help you out with the best solution. But will not be free, this is part of my daily work (Bitcoin consulting for newbies) and nowadays too many people that want to jump into this train want free info for their ignorance and laziness.  
Few years ago when I was giving free info about Bitcoin to friends, clients and other people they didn't listen to me and some they get hit hard by their ignorance and came back to me and apologize because they didn't listen. My answer to them was that from now on you have to pay my services to help you.  
So like that I started a year ago to be paid 100% in BTC. Part of my income is from my Bitcoin consulting services.

Good points!  
But is quite hard to distinguish between "agitators/agents", normal users, users that are manipulated, users with good will for Bitcoin, devs with good will and corrupted devs.  
I would like to add also point  EMPTY BLOCKS. Is an issue that for years was ignored and almost nobody bring it up. We allowed miners to be rewarded for doing nothing and today we have like 10% empty blocks from total and in the same time we cry about huge mempools.  
I have a question for devs: Why for years you did nothing to stop this THEFT?!
@_date: 2016-03-18 10:00:33
I'mn talking about the receive box, where it says "specific amount". If you sent 4btc but you put wrong how much you want to receive, thats it, you just sold your btc for a much lower price.  
That deposit limit is just to show you how much min/max is available to exchange in that moment not how much you HAVE to exchange.  
Sorry for your loss man. Next time pay attention to details.

@_date: 2016-03-03 17:38:41
Then there is a bigger problem with the code not just the block size. If was allowed knowingly that for years miners can be rewarded for fake work, so they make huge amounts of BTC without any reason, the devs know that but didn't bring it up to discussion.... then we are quite fucked I say...  
For me this empty blocks issue looks like a bigger problem than block size, right now. Allowing some users (miners) to cheat in this process means that the protocol is not trusted anymore...

WTF is that nonsense "bitcoin debit card"? Bitcoin is not debited, is OWNED, you can't spend a bitcoin without having it.
All those cards are fiat worthless cards that are designed to steal your valuable bitcoins and give you the illusion that spending fiat is more easier to use Bitcoin.
Wake up people, don't be fooled by these BS, use your own Bitcoin wallet! Be free not a slave to the banksters... We have to dump all fiat and not use it anymore in any form, if we want to be free and not slaves.
Satoshi gave us the power to create our own money and now people are giving back this power to the banksters, by using these stupid "bitcoin debit cards".
Like Obi Wan said: "use the Force Luke" I will say - "use your brain, use your own Bitcoin wallet people"
@_date: 2016-03-23 10:06:05
I suggest you the following steps:  
- take USB stick and create a Tails OS on it (bootable)   
- use another USB (smaller size) and encrypt it using Bitlocker from Windows 7 Pro/Ultimate  
- Boot with that Tails USB OS, and run the Electrum wallet. Create a new wallet. Write down those 12 words for passphrase.  
- Send few satoshis from your BCI wallet to that new created wallet, just for testing.  
- Restart the Tails OS. You newly created wallet will not be there anymore. So Open Electrum and select "restore wallet". Put those 12 words that you write down on paper. Testing the recovery before moving large amounts of coins is a good practice. If all your satoshis are there you can continue with moving the rest.  
- You can save that piece of paper with those 12 words, or remember them (is not hard if you train your brain), or put the words into a picture (and only you know the order).
Optional:  
- Once you have all your coins into Electrum wallet, encrypt the wallet (put a password that you will always remember and not an easy one). That password will be used only when you send coins from that wallet.  
- When the wallet file is encrypted, you can copy it to another USB stick and save that stick in a safe place. You always can open that file anytime without recovering from your passphrase. That file can be opened later in any version of Electrum wallet: desktop Windows/Linux/Tails or mobile. But remember that will be encrypted with that password you created.  
- The USB with the wallet file can be also encrypted with Bitlocker from Windows 7 Ultimate, so every time you try to read that USB will ask you a password. So even if somebody finds your USB or you lost it, they can't open it.  
- Always make 2-3 copies of that wallet file or those 12 words passphrase. You never know when the USB is broken.  
But is good to folloow some general rules:  
- Never keep large amounts of BTC in an online wallet, mobile wallet, desktop wallet.  
- Online wallets are banks, so better stay away from them or use only to buy BTC.  
- Large amounts of BTC - paper wallets or steel wallets   
- Medium amounts - desktop wallets, use only at home with a clean PC, I have a standard linux notebook with Electrum, that is not used for online stuff, just BTC.  
- Small amounts - mobile wallets, just to have with you when you travel or go for a drink.  
You are the banker now so you can organize your money in the way you want:   
- secured vault (paper/steel wallet): for storing long time, do not touch, just deposit  
- main storage (desktop wallets): for storing medium time, easy accessible, to transfer to mobile wallets when is needed, for paying bigger amounts  
- mobile storage (mobile wallets): exactly like your leather wallet with fiat bills, you never take with you many bills, just change.

That's not embracing Bitcoin, is just extortion for more fees. When I will see a bank that says:  
- I will keep your BTC safe in an offline vault (it's quite arguable that anyway, because is giving them control of keys)  
- I will "manage" your BTC and you will get in return an x% interest  
- I will give you BTC loans and inssurances  
Then I would say that is a bank that embraces Bitcoin. Otherwise is just a lie. I will never give to a bank my valuable BTC and to give me in return worthless fiat goat shit. That's theft.

Interesting idea, but their web definitely is unfinished. Switching languages always was a "problem" for Spanish people. At least they can remove the link for English until the translation is finished.  
The design that looks like paypal and even the logo colors says - copycat.  
The name "Octo" doesn't sound too trusted too.  
The focus on mixing currencies in the same app is not viable anymore. Fiat currencies will be obsolete soon so apps that still use fiat will have the same end: people will forget them.  
But I salute the good initiative of these young Spanish guys from Valencia. Like Bit2Me and Coinffeine, this app will add up to Spanish contribution to Bitcoin revolution and we need to see more like these, Spain need to have a good position in Bitcoin development. I hope they will throw away the idea of using fiat and concentrate in Bitcoin more.

Hahaha this is funny but I see it like this:  
The Bitcoin adoption is like core client syncing:  
- the ones that start earlier, they already have a BTC stash but also the core client up to date  
- the ones that are waking up now (quite late) discover that only 5 millions BTC remain to mine and also they have to sync their client core.  
When we (the early adopters) was speaking loud about BTC everybody else laugh of us and say we are crazy nerds. Now they come to take the remaining crumbs and also they have to sync the whole core like a "prize" for their ignorance.  
Now the show just start: we will see people trying to catch some satoshis, like zombies a piece of meat. And I will really laugh to those who I told them years ago to take some BTC and they laugh of it, that now they will come to beg some satoshis from me.

Hey we should sell our core sync to those who want BTC... many of them doesn't know that is not really necessary to have a core wallet.  Any offer, I have 5 nodes synced and running.

Merchant adoption will never grow if these kind of "hybrid" services are pushed to consumers. People are lazy and ignorant so for that they will see these "hybrid" services like a easy way, but in fact is not...  
The "bitcoin cards" like xapo or shift are good for the transition, but in the end will be obsolete like the banks and fiat.  
Me for example, I start using xapo card before I was paid in BTC but let's say like 10-15% of my total expenses and only when I couldn't pay in BTC directly. That was more than a year ago. But then I start being paid only in BTC and start paying bills from my BTC wallet. So my use of xapo goes down to 1% last month. Paying ONLY few times, few amounts where was not possible (yet) to pay with BTC (ie. parkings).  
So if these companies that want to take over these 1% markets of "hybrid" payments, good luck with that... the rest of 99% will go to BTC acceptance merchants directly. Will not take too much until the merchants will really understand the power of having a BTC wallet.

Thanks for heads up and great explanation!  
I had a big signal alarm when Bitreserve changed their name in Uphold and they dropped Bitcoin. I don't have the link now but I saw their announcement that will not use anymore Bitcoin.  
I didn't use their services but that raised a big question about them and I really had the impression at that time that this storm will follow and that they are just a bunch of crooks and bankster agents.
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:54:46
Bitcoin is not used only by US people so stop saying that a fee  of 5 cents is nothing. At least can say that 100k satoshis worth nothing for you, but for others worth a lot.  
Paying every month a higher fee is not greed? What makes a higher fee to be more efficient in securing a tx than a lower fee? The fee is there not to be higher or lower... But just greed make it higher.
@_date: 2016-03-20 22:43:14
Hahaha good one! Very true also.  
Hey u/allthingsbtc you should do some t-shirts like this !

The key is just to sign the tx not to make a tx. Similar to what Airbnb is about to do.  
Or BitID   
Just imagine the tourism industry with millions of apartments for tourists: the owner have a key and the client receive a chip token with the 2nd key from a multisig address. The door can be open only with those 2 keys.  
Let's say you are a tourist and rent an apartment in L.A. through an agency. You make the payment in BTC with your BTC address and automatically that address can be written into that token chip. The door will be programmed to be opened with your key only for the days you rent that apartment. Additionally can be setup a multisig scenario when the door can be opened with the owner and your key. So when your time of rental is over, you can leave the token in the apartment (to be re-programmed with a new customer key) or just keep it like a souvenir.  
There are many innovations that can be done in this area... based on bitcoin blockchain or using other cryptos.

Ask non-US user about how much worth for them a tx fee.. Let's stop BS with this centric US usage of Bitcoin.  
Maybe you forget that bitcoins are limited to 21 millions, so spending now 50k satoshis for a tx fee, in 10 years I can pay 1 month rent with 50k satoshis.  
Also is enough that we pay free reward to miners for those 10% of empty blocks!  
As you can see I didn't mention any fiat conversion because that is already goat shit and really doesn't make sense to express the fees in goat shit...

Some ideas for you guys (btw you are doing a great job):  
- some models with 3D figures like those from Mountain T-shirts, but with Bitcoin figures  
- some models with Star Wars theme (the SW community will get it easier). I have one in my collection with: May the COIN be with you and the B sign in Millenium Falcon.  
- some with a building from where banskters are falling down (suicide) and some rockets with Bitcoin going up to Mars...
- some models with more historical phrases. Andreas A. have really good ones.  
My favorite quotes:  
Andreas:  
"Government say they are worried that criminals will use bitcoin. In truth, they are terrified that all the rest of us will"  
"Bitcoin's invention was an engineering solution to a governance problem. We can solve bitcoin's governance challenges with more engineering"  
"Bitcoin will do to banks what email did to the postal industry"  
"50 currencies today have less intrinsic value than goat shit"  
"Bitcoin is global, decentralized and unstoppable. Let govt try, it will be hilarious to watch"  
A bitcoiner on Reddit (sorry I don't remember his name):  
"Bitcoin is even bulletproof against time-travelers. No one can go back in time and bring a lot of coins to or from future"  
"Bitcoin concepts are just too hard for the bankers to understand"  
"Economists and journalists often get caught up in this question: Why does Bitcoin have value? And the answer is very easy. Because it is useful and scarce"  
"Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative"  
"Bitcoin is getting there but it’s not there yet. When it gets there, expect governments to panic and society to be reshaped into something where governments cannot rely on taxing income nor wealth for running their operations"  
"Gold is the money of kings; silver is the money of gentlemen; bitcoin is the money of technofiles; barter is the money of peasants; but debt is the money of slaves"
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:17:05
This utopia like "Venus Project" will never work, just because they want to remove the idea of money.  
The human history start with money because humans can't exist without a form of money.  
Removing the money = slavery. A slave will not have money (doesn't need them) and freedom (doesn't have the right). Slavery has evolved in many ways...  
I suggest you to watch this presentation of Andreas about money, that explain very well the money: 
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:02:55
As I said, I'm paid for my work in BTC. So every month the employer send me BTC to a specific BTC address. I can change that addresss every month but still is a large amount of BTC into a single address linked to me.  
So when I spend those BTC I will never spend them from the address I receive them.  
So the quick solution is to spread across many other addresses, anonymous them, using an altcoin. Until Bitcoin code will be updated with an anonymous option/feature this is my personal solution. Works for me enough.

Expressing the fee in USD doesn't make any sense.  
USD = endlessly printed/created goat shit by banksters of Jeckyll Island  
BTC = limited mining/creation to 21 millions  
Saying that 7 cents of fee TODAY is not too much, in few years will be 7USD, but in fact will be the same 10k satoshis like today.  
Also those 7 cents can be a meal for a guy in Ghana, India or Nepal.  
Let's be clear, fees should trend to 1 satoshi not to 1BTC, otherwise this network will not viable for everybody and will end up in not be used anymore.

There is no such thing of "virtual wallet". If will be, also your bitcoins will be virtual.   
Only your bank account is full of virtual fiat money, you know, banksters are just puting some numbers in the computer and done you have virtual money.  
Bitcoins are not virtual. We can say are digital money but also you are the owner of them all the time, if you have a personal wallet, not online wallet.  
The difference between online wallets and personal wallets is:  
- online wallets - you are not in control of the wallet keys, you don't own those bitcoins.  
- personal wallets - you are all the time in control of the keys, you are the owner of those bitcoins.  
@_date: 2016-03-19 10:07:27
Great idea! Bitcoin is the future of our children and they need to learn about it.  
I used to teach my daughter about Bitcoin, so I started first by explaining her what are money, in the history and how are created now by feds (there are tons of videos about this even animated). In the first moment when she realized that feds are just creating fake/virtual money she asked: so what people are going to do about this? My answer was: Bitcoin. Then I start explaining bit by bit how it works, in simple words and examples from real life so she can understand it better.  
Keep up and let us know how was your son presentation. Make a video (if you can) and post it, will help the humanity, you are part of the history now.

That's why multisig is wonderful... And I'm pretty sure will be wallets with self empty code feature. So instead of opening key you can put a special code and that will trigger to empty the wallet to a specific other wallet. Even if they beat you out of shit but they obtain nothing.

If somebody still don't have BTC to pay me, they cand send the fiat payment to bitwage.co or cashila.com or bitwa.la and I receive BTC into my wallet.  
People should start to demand to be paid in BTC and not waiting anymore to be ripped of by exchanges. We already have 17 millions BTC in circulation and enough for all.

so you will be a slave example not just a slave... go to a library and read more books to see who created the taxes long time ago... In schools they don't tell anymore why taxes was created but they teach that you HAVE TO pay your taxes.  
Taxes are to fund wars (the military complex) and make richer the rich. The story with building roads, hospitals and schools is just a bedtime story. The common expenses for a society can be done easily with crowdfunding based on real necesity and common decision at a local level.  
That's why govs/politicians/banksters are afraid of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin will stop the wars, because they can't spend anymore money that they don't have them. You can spend a bitcoin that you don't own it.  
Watch this docu for example, will explain you how is it

Simple. Make several exchanges to altcoins using shapeshift.io and then send them back into bitcoin wallet with different BTC addresses.  
I'm paid in BTC to a single BTC address every month so I take those BTC and move them across different altcoins and back to many addresses into 3-4 different wallets.  
This works just fine for me. And sometimes I can even earn a bit more because of the exchange rates. But that is fine, will cover the fees :)

All fiat became worthless...  
If you have a product that you produce and sell me every month and I will pay you with money that I will print them myself, because I have a printer and balls to do that, you will still continue to sell me those products? And more than that, when you need more money to buy materials and machinery, salaries etc and come to me to give you a loan, using the same money I print them endlessly, then you will have to pay me interest for that loan with the money (printed by me) you sell me the products, you still think those money have value when all your profits will end to be in the interest you pay me and I also have your products ? You remain only with debt to me. You will be my slave.

SR case was an undercover operation of feds from the beginning. They create it, put the idea in the minds of some admins, but they control it all the time. Exactly like those fake child porn sites used by FBI to catch the bad guys.  
Ross was used like a patsy without him knowing. They manipulate him from the beginning to cover the full operation so they can never be in "front line".  
The whole operation was to denigrate Bitcoin, to put it in a bad light and a patsy in jail for it. They don't care so much about those who was dealing drugs on SR because they are already part of that (most of it).  
To answer your question: now you know who have those 400k...

That because they don't want to "strike" from only one shot. Will be too obvious and can have a reverse action.  
Remember the: problem - reaction - solution?  
So the banksters and feds want only to slow down the Bitcoin adoption and deceive the population trust in Bitcoin, so they can come up with their fedcoin, rscoin or whatever BSCoin they can control.  
So it's a simple plan:  
-  create the problem: Bitcoin is for criminals bla bla  
- wait for the reaction and manipulate it through media: people are outraged by Bitcoin "bad use" etc  
- come up with the solution: RSCoin, FEDcoin, the best coins in town backed by govs and banksters...  
Then the world is taken over, total control...

Showing them that you made a backup of their wallet/money, will decimate the trust in you and in Bitcoin...  
I remember a year ago that I introduced a fiend to Bitcoin and he did like you said, lost his wallet.

Why people are so obsessed with market cap, coincap and other BS caps?  
The whole thing of converting a crypto into fiat doesn't make any sense anymore.  
Fiat is goat shit so why should I continue to calculate my coins value in that goat shit?  
Instead of these stupid marketcaps stats people should make a comparison chart between each crypto, each with his own features and functionality. Then will make sense to have an overview so users can decide better which ones to use and in what quantities.  
Showing each crypto how much shit worth it will make them all look like shit. And is not like that. Few people knows differences between BTC and LTC or DOGE and not talking about others. Each crypto have his own properties and destination, stop comparing them to fiat. IT'S A TOTAL NONSENSE!

I think I can get used with that, until they will get "tired" of doing "fake" tx just to get the reward. At the end is their right to make txs as many as they want but rewarding them for empty blocks is TOTALLY WRONG.  
Right now they get hundreds of BTC for that and we still discussing this issue. And this is wrong for the network, wrong for the community, wrong for the image of BTC.

The question is not why they mine empty blocks (we already know the process of empty blocks), but the right question is why we reward those empty blocks. Miners have for years mined at least 10% of empty blocks, nobody say a word, devs look on the other side and miners get the rewards for each of those empty blocks.  
If the devs would patch in some way the code so will force in some way the miners to fill the blocks with at least 90-95%, those empty blocks will disappear all of the sudden and the process of mining will be much fair.
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:18:39
In my point of view, altcoins are necessary, but not obligatory, in order for Bitcoin to take over. Even when (not if)  Bitcoin network will pass the difficulties from now, the altcoins will help Bitcoin to cover the other functionalities/usage that was not designed to have.  
Bitcoin will be like the base for all other altcoins. If you would like/need some other altcoin for a specific usage, you will need to use BTC to buy those altcoins.  
In the end I see that each country will have his own coin, backed by a certain amount of BTC. And that will be a fair use of Bitcoin.

First of all in a Bitcoin/Blockchain "supremacy" a country's central bank will not need to keep their reserves in another country's bank... Doesn't make sense.  
Secondly in a Bitcoin dominated economy a central bank doesn't make sense anymore... only if they will keep/create a national crypto backed by BTC.  
That's why we need to ditch fiat and central bank crooks. They just enslave us.

Depends of what amount is available for exchange in that moment. Transacting a large amount of coins at once is not a good idea.  
If you use the old version of the site I think is mentioning what is the maximum that you can exchange.  
And if you put wrong in the box "specific amount" to receive you just give a huuuge bonus to the one that made the exchange. I think this was the fail... Never put the amount you want to receive. Leave it for the market to calculate it.

Always when most of the time is user's fault they point to Bitcoin itself or service provider.  
I use Bitcoin and BCI for 4 years without any problem.  
1. You was warned many times here that BCI wallet have issues ans should proceed with caution.  
2. You are not mentioning if you use the mobile app or web.  
3. If you used mobile app did you have it updated?  
4. The title is misleading. Should  be "user create double spend intent and get angry that didn't get through". People let's be more caution with titles, these posts are indexed and other noobs (or dumb jurnalists) when they search and find this title will start an "ohhh bitcoin is bad!", or will create articles like "Bitcoin CEO was arrested..."

First of all read this to see who really is Coinbase:   
Then I suggest you to use Coinbase only to exchange fiat to btc and move the coins to one of YOUR wallets dedicated for exchanges.  
Then use shapeshift.io to move those bitcoins to another altcoin and then back to another of your wallets, dedicated to store, use, hold etc.  
I use to do that back few years when I was buying bitcoin. Now I EARN bitcoin so I don't need to buy anymore. Sometimes I move them through shapeshift, just to lose track of some.  
My real advice for all people: start demanding to be paid in BTC and don't bother anymore with exchanges. Bitwage and Cashila works great for this.
@_date: 2016-03-11 15:57:01
That's why is better not to use chrome and any other shity extensions. Keep and use a clean browser. Any browser (except chrome) now, have a function to not track you and do not keep cache/history once you close it.  
Definitely using chrome when you are dealing with BTC is a really bad decision.

You can earn BTC by working for or selling a product. Maybe this will inspire you   
I'm earning BTC (work for BTC) and I live on BTC for a year and this was my goal when I heard first time about BTC in 2012.  
There are already 17 millions BTC in circulation, from a total of 21 that will ever existed. So is time to have some.  
In all these years from 2008 until 2016 you know about BTC and you even not played some faucets to have some?! Geeze you could earn a lot for free all these years... any satoshi count in the end. I remember that in early days the faucets dropped like 1BTC/15min, damn... that was golden age...

There is no obligation in Bitcoin protocol to pay a high fee for a tx. Fees should tend to 1 satoshi not to 1 million.  
You pay high fees because you want to feed the greedy miners, but nobody can say that your tx will not get through with 1k satoshi fee.  
I live on BTC for about a year and I have no problems at all. And I closed all my bank accounts, those was a pain in the ass for all their stupid fees and capital control.
@_date: 2016-03-25 09:50:20
It is for me: I'm paid in BTC, I spend in BTC, I hold what remains. Depend on people around you and their open mind.  
I live in a small community where people start realizing that BTC is the only hope and we are using it every day more.  
Bitcoin mass adoption starts from local communities, not from your gov, politicians or some big company that announce their BTC acceptance.  
Bitcoin mass adoption starts by understanding how banks are enslaving us (including those cards you mentioned) and using BTC will give you the freedom back.  
Those "bitcoin debit cards" are just an illusion that you use BTC, using those cards you just give more hope to banksters to exist.

Yes is just a bank but many new users don't start with that information and/or really don't understand what does it means.  
Also Coinbase is way over-hyped like a service. I see many here that when a new user is asking for an advice for a wallet or where to buy, 99% are recommending Coinbase for both but forgot to mention the tons of other services and some of them way better than Coinbase.  
But none of those who recommend Coinbase never mention who really is behind: 
@_date: 2016-03-31 11:11:50
there many many services and webs where you can pay with BTC but are not advertised.  
I live on BTC and I'm amazed of so many places where you can pay with BTC. But yeah you have to search deep and where you can't find BTC option ask polite if they have in mind to accept it. Leave a note in all places. I received back an OK answer of about 50% and that is great.

You can't trade in a correct way with currencies that are created endlessly on the "other side"...

@_date: 2016-03-01 14:24:51
I agree with that. If there is a fees war why only miners have to profit from them ? Nodes are also important in a tx so they get nothing...  
If the node fee will be introduced then we will have more nodes also, good, like miners.
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:40:37
well done, stick it into your ass, it's a safe place anyway for SWIFT robberies...
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:36:14
I stop thinking in fiat conversion 1 year ago... doesn't make sense anymore. Having a pile of goat shit/ fiat will not make me rich or comfortable. On the other side spending now not necessarily 50k satoshis for a tx (doesn't matter how much BTC are in that tx) will make me regret later that I made that tx today.  
I repeat: higher fees doesn't make Bitcoin network more secure, but just miners fat pockets...

Is like you are worry to use email because are still fax machines in the world that still working and sending faxes... damn, use Bitcoin every day and forget about that shit. First of all demand to be paid in BTC, then pay only with BTC, close all your bank accounts and forget about fiat.  
I did that a year ago and now I am a FREE MAN. FUCK THE BANKSTERS and their SWIFT fucking system.

How that plastic fiat card help you in Greece when you still have limits to withdraw from ATM ?  
If you say that the card help you to use fiat (that you can't withdraw) to buy BTC and pay with BTC I understand that helps but not the way around...  
That's the problem with fiat, once is in a bank account is not YOURS anymore. And if you use BTC to top up that account is worst - you give up your freedom to use BTC to have them locked in a bank account...
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:05:07
Maybe the message/image was fake but important is what is saying there, that is not fake.

I live on BTC for about a year. I close all my bank accounts already. I'm paid in BTC, I spend in BTC (I don't use any shity "bitcoin debit card"), I hold what remains. I also have some stash (not moved) from the early days when I was mining heavily with GPUs.  
For me personally the illusion that some day BTC will be $10,000 or whatever goat shit fiat, doesn't make sense. Fiat in few years will be obsolete so thinking that I will change my valuable BTC for worthless fiat is a nonsense.  
But in my opinion Bitcoin in 10-20 years will evolve into THE BASE of other "colored coins". For example: each community, country or region can create their own coin, backed by a certain amount of BTC. Bitcoin will be the real digital gold.
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:15:13
Maybe you get me wrong. I was trying to express that in a fair exchange one part give something valuable and the other part also give something valuable. But nowadays fiat is no longer valuable.

@_date: 2016-03-01 22:23:42
Tell that to a guy from India or Indonesia that 50k satoshi fee for his tx is not so much because another guy in US is throwing around with dollars...  
Stop bullshiting with fees worth of 20 cents, bitcoin tx fees are in satoshis and are huuuge!  
US is the country with 50 million homeless/hunger people and you say that 20cents is a small fee?! Look around you boy...  
I have to remember you that we will have only 21 million BTC in the entire history of humanity?
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:14:36
Fees are in satoshis not in "p" whatever the fuck is that.  
Bitcoin is global, is not only for US, UK, EU. A guy in Africa or India, Venezuela or Argentina will appreciate 1000 satoshis much more than you.  
Or we go back to a currency only for rich and those who can afford to use it?  
In few years even you will cry for those satoshis... like the guy that paid 10k BTC for 2 pizzas...
@_date: 2016-03-28 20:54:14

@_date: 2016-03-17 13:57:31
Is not a mystery, depends where you live and which people are around you. I live in a small community in EU. I will not give too many details because we don't want to be another "refugee destination".   
But as far I can say is that the merchants adoptions in our area is growing fast. And are many communities like this but not many are publishing their "achievements" on coinmap.org or other sites.   
For that many people say that are not too many places where to spend their coins, but not that is the important question. The question is: what did you do to improve the acceptance and the awareness of Bitcoin? Bitcoin will start to be accepted at local communities level not governmental announcements on TV...  
Acceptance of BTC is not starting in mass with Microsoft, TigerDirect, Dish or OverStock. Those are just the signals that is time to start thinking WTF is wrong with my gov. Acceptance in mass starts with local shops, in small communities, freelancers etc.  
I explain it here not long ago: 
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:44:27
Why always the fees should be expressed in $ !? Fuck that shit $/€ Bitcoin is global not ONLY for US people.  
5000 satoshis are not the same worth in US, EU than Africa, India, Argentina or Venezuela!  
Fees should tend to 1 satoshis not to 1 million!  
And one more thing: Fiat money are UNLIMITED, satoshis are LIMITED. Remember this every time you make a tx. Maybe you don't care about 5 cents today ($ are goat shit anyway) but in few years you will cry for those 5000 satoshis from today. Remember the guy that paid 10k BTC (not satoshis) for 2 fucking pizzas? Remember that every day from now...

fuck that shit. Buy only from those who accept. Boycott banksters.  
I live on BTC for about a year of now and I have no problems. I am a free man!  
If we continue to use the bansksters tools we will be always their slaves!  
Convince your regular merchants to accept BTC, fight for your freedom, otherwise you are just a another slave...  
Banksters and govs will NEVER  come to you and say, hey use BTC because is better for you... but will do EVERYTHING POSSIBLE that you will not use it. And these "bitcoin debit cards" are just another banskter's trick. Think about this.   
Even the term "bitcoin debit card" is a nonsense. Bitcoin can't be debited with money that you don't have. Bitcoin you have it or don't. You can't spend a bitcoin that you don't have it. Depositing BTC into those cards and converting to fiat in bank accounts is just that you give up your real freedom money (BTC) for fake/endless/virtual money (fiat).

And btw WTF is this Gandalf Randal? Not even clicked on this clickbait...
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:04:42
That's the main barrier of adopting Bitcoin; people still get to use to think in fiat value...  
I live on BTC for about a year and never have problems or losing money. I closed all my bank accounts and forget about fiat. Is just a matter of thinking, a perception of value.
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:38:53
Try an account from BBVA, they actually ARE Coinbase - 
@_date: 2016-03-18 12:13:02
They always said that Bitcoin brings more innovation. But this is not innovation, is just another ostrich-camel...  
We should focus more on how to REPLACE fiat with crypto no to mixing them in a way that just create more 3rd parties that suck fees, commissions and control your identity.  
Using a so named "bitcoin debit card" (what a nonsense anyway) you just give up your pseudonimity using BTC directly and all your spending habits that goes to feds and marketing companies.  
Just an example for those who still use a plastic card   
People, we have to ditch the fiat in any forms! Use directly your BTC wallet! Make more merchants to accept BTC, don't help them to continue with plastic cards!  
Using fiat you are a slave forever, using BTC you are a free man forever. Don't let them fool you with nice apps that convert your BTC into fiat and viceversa, is just a trick of banksters to slow down  the adoption in mass of BTC and their end...  
Anyway, what we should expect from US... they prefer a candy bar instead of a silver bar...

Oh man, you are totally wrong: you don't need permission to use Bitcoin.  
And I don't live in Canada, I'm in EU, in a small community.  
And I will tell you something: Satoshi gave us the power (taken from the banksters) to create our own money, but now people are "in love" with those stupid "bitcoin debit shit cards", that practically you give back the power of enslavement to the banksters. So Satoshi did a great thing to free you from slavery but you go back to enslavement by yourself because the banksters brainwased you with those "wonderful" piece of plastic shit...  
I'm sorry for you guys (users of that shit cards) but you deserve this enslavement...
@_date: 2016-03-03 10:26:59

I like Electrum for desktop and I use it like default wallet. But for the mobile version I will wait until will be more mature. I test it and is slow and sometimes crashing because is taking too much memory.  
But I salute the effort and I donate some to them.  
Also I would like to see the option like in the desktop version to send from 1 address and also to re-use an existing one for receiving, sending one to many also will be good.  
I saw you can browse the wallet files, can I put in that folder the wallet files I have on my desktop version and open them on mobile?
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:07:47
Another one that thinks Bitcoin is ONLY for rich guys... and forget that bitcoins are limited to 21 millions and not endless goat shit fiat...  
We are NOT talking about cents but satoshis. FUCK the fiat! The future is Bitcoin.  
Fees should trend to 1 satoshi not to 1 million satoshis. Otherwise we have to go back to creating endless BTC like fiat... Imagine the tx fees like the interest you pay now for the gov debt... and you pay and pay and pay endlessly.  
Let's be clear, and who doesn't understand this formula, doesn't understand Bitcoin:  
Bitcoin = debt freedom  
Fiat = debt slavery

Bitcoin can be "dead" only when only 1 user/node/miner remain in use. But in fact the trend is on the other direction. More and more real bitcoiners are using it for daily life, like real currency and not exclusively like an investment or holding with hope that some day they will sell it for $10k... That is just an illusion of being rich someday in goat shit.
@_date: 2016-03-18 16:06:01
Bitcoin is open source, everybody can make their own version. The question is how many users will use a version or another...

Bitcoin is global not ONLY in US. You can stick with your US shity bankster's tool Coinbase. In EU we have many other exchanges for every "taste".  
This is an app that you can exchange BTC/EUR to any bank ATM in EU without any bank account.  
But I think OP wanted to register to buy BTC using their web so that can take longer until they KYC.  
u/BitcoinSuperman I suggest you to use BitBoat.net top buy so you can avoid registration. Work the other way around: You buy anonymously from web, go to a bank ATM and deposit fiat cash, then instant you receive BTC.

Bitcoin without The Blockchain can't function. For that is named The Bitcoin Blockchain. And blockchain without Bitcoin is just a ledger that is not useful or is just serving an altcoin. That means, whatever you do and design, without Bitcoin will be a worthless shit.  
And you have decide how you write: the blockchain is not the same with a "block chain".

That's exactly the script that banksters gave him to post, they were looking with this to create panic in bitcoin community and other people so they can come up with their failed banksterchain saying that is the only one solution viable ....  
There are many people that quit and sell all their coins because of their personal views, is their right. But coming from a bankster's spy/tool will have more impact on bitcoin trust.  
This manipulation is exactly what was tried with Silk Road case...  
I'm sure there are many other good devs that can replace him and I really have doubts that he sell all his bitcoins (we need prove for that).

You don't bother, is good that you ask, but in order to create lots of misleading information in a thread, better read first from a well known and verified repository. Otherwise, everybody here became an "expert" in explaining you and most of the time you will get wrong information. Then is really bad to start with wrong info...  
After you read those documentations (take your time and educate yourself) and you really have more questions, you can post here anytime your questions. If you need to know verified faucets, I can give a list of them by PM.

Yes I know, I use them and also cashila.com for EU payments. I think are one of the best solution out there for those who want to EARN BTC, instead of shiting around with Coinbase and other BS banksters exchanges.  
I live on BTC for about a year now and my incomes are 100% in BTC (40% bitwage and cashila, 60% direct BTC into may wallets).  
FUCK THE BANKSTERS! I CLOSED ALL MY BANK ACCOUNTS!

Empty blocks are a disgrace for Bitcoin and for devs that allow such thing.  
Is like that in a bus station are a lot of persons waiting (with their tickets already paid) to jump in the bus, but the driver say: sorry, this bus I will ride it alone because they already paid me to do that, so you can go fuck yourself and walk away or wait until next bus maybe will take you. This is insane!  
We are fighting to raise the block size but nobody is saying anything about this stupidity and theft! Only in the last few days Antpool (and maybe other pools) have lots of empty blocks, when we have a huge mempool and people waiting for their txs to be confirmed.
I think this is an outrageous error from devs that let this happen !  
Should be a rule that will give them 0 reward for empty blocks and a limit of 95% minimum full blocks in order to have a reward. Put them at work not letting them to pretend to work!  
If devs let this happen I think many of them are involved in this theft with the miners.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
And the list can go on and on and on. How many txs can fit in all these empty blocks?!
@_date: 2016-03-19 18:50:02

Yeah this is a fucking nightmare. Users are waiting their tx to be confirmed, even with higher fees, but the greedy miners are faking their work.  
This should be A MUST in the next bitcoin version: no more empty blocks mined or at least 95%. If they mine an empty block - 0 reward.  
Empty blocks mined = fiat endless printing/creating money

Local groceries or online. In EU are a lot starting to accept BTC.  
But yes... US is focusing in shity "bitcoin debit cards" instead of convincing/make it easier for local merchants to accept BTC...  
You don't need a big name where to buy your food. The local food always is better.  
I heard from a neighbor that a small town 50km from where I live they even create their own crypto currency, backed by BTC... You will not see these kind of news on TV because those people don't want to be on TV... but are real.

Yes, I see it like that too.  
In few years, fiat will be obsolete and Bitcoin will be the real "digital gold".  
People will start creating "colored coins" in their communities, countries etc and those coins will be backed by a certain amount of BTC.  
Fedcoins or bankchains will not have in any way success.  
I see many people that see ETH like a "replacement" of BTC but that is a big lie or manipulation.  
First of all each altcoin was designed to have specific features and be used with a specific role.  
Then ETH is UNLIMITED and BTC is LIMITED. We are not going back to endless generated currency. ETH is good for what was designed his role and will never replace BTC.

Yeah good point! And also they use to say about Bitcoin that is a "virtual currency"... What is more "virtual"? Fiat currency that is created by a click out of nothing or Bitcoin that is mined by math algorithm, you have proof of existence and more than that is a property?
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:40:05
I'm a cashila user for many months. But I will never use big amounts of fiat through a service like this. And not because can be a scam, is because like many others cashila need to respect the laws and they are more watched then normal people. Cashila have great services and I used them every month with no issue.     
Remember that any bank account (including their bank) is verified for capital controls. So is not their fault, I think is more your fault. Your transaction raised an alarm and for that is on hold by the banskters.  
If read and understand the message it says clearly that your account is in pending to verify for KYC/AML, that means the banksters are going to check even in your butt if you are not a bad guy...  
That's why we need to use as much we can direct BTC transfers. The friction point is at the conversion fiat - BTC and BTC - fiat. And that is the point where banksters still have control.  
Now, if you want advice to move 50k€ around, I suggest to be more inventive and try not to raise alarms. There are many ways, it's up to you how to find them.

You start with the wrong step with Coinbase, that actually is a bank and an exchange, is not a bitcoins wallet. For every exchange you need to pay a fee.  
You want BTC without exchange fees? EARN IT. Work for BTC, sell something for BTC.

Sorry if I you think I am against Wirex and I follow you. Nothing at all, I appreciate your efforts and good will but in my opinion I think you focus your efforts to a wrong direction. Even if now for few years your business model will make some money, soon when more people will wake up and will be like me will not use anymore those services and will use instead their BTC wallet (no intermediaries, no exchanges, no tracking). So your business model is not here to live too much.  
If on the other way, you also focus in creating apps and ways that merchants will fully adopt BTC then you will have success for many years from now on. If you can't foresee in 10-20 years from now and you focus just for 1-10 years, then at the end you will be like the fax machine, forgotten in a corner of the room...
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:42:05
Adoption of Bitcoin is only about you the user not the state. if you wait for your state to say "hey from now on you can deal in BTC" then you will wait until the stars will fall on you.  
In 2 weeks I convinced my employer to pay me in BTC, in another 3 weeks I convinced my landlord to accept my BTC for the rent, in another month I convinced 2-3 local shops to accept BTC (from me and my landlord). That's the way to make Bitcoin adopted...  
I will pay no matter the % of service charge just to NOT USE banks!

Comparing Bitcoin network with Uber network doesn't make any sense.   
We are now in a moment when miners are blackmailing us with higher fees because they know the halving is coming so their profits are halving too, so they want to "recover" their loses in some way.  
They don't like small fees? Fine, they just have to shut down their huge facilities and we can go back to GPU mining individually and the network will be just fine.

Yes but is not done by me. I'm paying to cashila in BTC, is their problem what they are doing with those BTC.  
On the other side, if you use a plastic card in YOUR name, you are the one that makes the exchange in YOUR name and YOU are using the fiat. That fiat tx is pegged to your name.  
For example I still have 2 years to finish the car payment. So I have a friend that wants BTC, so I have an agreement with him, each time I have to pay the credit receipt, he pay it and I give him BTC. So I never touch again fiat.  
My landlord is NOT converting his BTC into fiat, he use them and part of them hold them. He even think to pay one of his cleaning employee (he have many apartments) that is happy to accept BTC. So one by one everybody in my local community start to realize that moving from fiat is a good choice and easy process.

You still use that crap app? Was made only to catch fool users so they can move on to CitiCoin (behind GG is Citybank). Their BTC wallet always have problems. Luckily, if you have money into that wallet, you can import it into Multibit or Wiper (another chat+BTC wallet app).  
To move your gemz you need help/approval from GG team. This is not control of your money, this is control of you, exactly like a bank, you need their approval to withdraw your money.    
So stay away from GG, not worth it. Don't say I didn't warn you... sooner or later everybody that has a bankster behind will show their real master face... even if the devs have good intentions, they will be forced to do whatever the bankster want.

Periodically I use to exchange my BTC into LTC using shapeshift.io and back to BTC into new created address. Also spreading to many new addresses if is a big amount.  
For example I receive my salary in 1 BTC address, that payment I exchange it into LTC and back to BTC spread it into many new addresses or even another wallet. When I exchange it in LTC I also use many txs not only one, big. Yes this have an incovenient: many fees and satoshis lost.... but is a good way to hide your stash.

To buy bitcoins I strongly recommend the P2P exchange bitsquare.io - you are always in control of all your money and also you are not "interrogated" like hell with those stupid AML/KYC.  
Also is time to think and demand to be paid in BTC from where you are working.  
If you are a freelancer I strongly suggest to start with Bitwage or Cashila. You can receive your wages/payments from fiat into your bitwage/cashila account and you can receive BTC in the moment. You don't need a bank account in your name anymore.  
A great video here

I always used 1000-5000 satoshis fee for any tx. And all get through very well.  
Giving to miners more and more you just "feed" them and will became more greedy. When they will see that users will not feed them, will fight for any tx to include it into a block. If they don't like it, are free to shut down their miners, others will take place immediately.

You see all over the news that "bitcoins are seized" but none of them are giving details and that is wrong for the rest of people that doesn't know how really Bitcoin works. YOU CAN'T SEIZE BITCOINS WITHOUT PRIVATE KEYS!  
Also the term "seized bitcoins" is false, a nonsense. You can OBTAIN private key but NEVER can seize bitcoins. Bitcoin always will stay on the blockchain.

Saying "now BTC market cap is 10bn of goat shit" is the same saying "BTC market cap is 1 kilo of real goat shit". But is not the same saying that bitcoins in circulation worth 171300 tons of real gold. That is a point from where you want to start making "prices"...

A merchant will never sell his products/services for a currency that will not offer value for him. When the merchant will see that you and others have only BTC will start accept it.  
If you demand to be paid in BTC, that company will have to options: buy those BTC or earn them (accept them) but selling products/services. Guess which option is best for them...  
So again: work for bitcoins and demand to be paid in BTC!  
I see merchants that start accepting BTC and they use discounts for those paying in BTC. WRONG!  
Do it at reverse! Increase the prices with 10-15% for those who pay with fiat/plastic cards and keep the lower/normal price for those who pay with BTC. That makes fiat more worthless and BTC easier to use.  
I see many people that are tipping (giving away) BTC. WRONG!  
I give away fiat bills but never BTC! Bitcoin is too valuable to be given away... and no matter the price in fiat is. When fiat will disappear we will have limited bitcoins! Giving away today some satoshis, is like throwing away a fortune in few years.  
Many will say that this is a dream, I am delusional, but I have news for you guys: I would like to have as much as I can BTC in my wallet and to be the one that will laugh in the end...  
Throw away you bitcoins, I will be glad to throw away the worthless goat shit fiat for them. Nice exchange: **the best invention in human history** for a bunch of (endless) IOU papers that worth less than goat shit.

Backing? That is not just backing, it is controlling. A bank will always have the goal to CONTROL their "investment" not just profit. I think you are missing the point with banks...  
Coinbase was created by them just to slow down the BTC adoption and make things harder for newbies. Also to CONTROL WHO BUY/SELL BTC. This friction point is the only thing banksters can do against BTC: trace, record and who knows what elese they will do in the future with this information.  
People should realize this important point: banksters will not give up easily. People should start dumping the fiat (source of tracking and control) and start using their BTC wallets directly. Start buying BTC through [P2P exchanges]( in person trades, ways that will never let trace of your buy BTC operation linked to your identity.  
ONLY like that we can get out from this deep shit that banksters built around us.

The "value" of BTC in fiat money is NO value. You can't make something more valuable or less valuable when you are talking about fiat worthless goat shit.  
And again, this the beauty of BTC: banksters CANNOT use it, because they can't double spend it, they can't lie about it, they can't counterfeit it, they can't endless print it.  
The value of BTC in gold oz is another story.

@_date: 2016-06-19 10:52:56
Somewhere in EU, small community.  
Many people think that US is the country that lead the BTC adoption, but they are wrong. EU countries will be the first in adoption soon. Maybe not making BTC the main currency used but in the instruments of using BTC like the main currency.  
I see that in few years will popup many local/regional/national coins backed by a certain amount of BTC. and from that point many people will use those coins daily and put the fiat into history books.  
US is not prepared for that and most important thing is that US people are not mentally prepared for that.  
EU soon will have huge social and economic problems. What happen in Cyprus, Greece, UK (now brexit) , Germany (rapefugees), Spain (soon will change the direction) are just the tip of the iceberg.  The Netherlands is one of the EU country with huge adoption/usage of BTC.  
Soon many EU people will see the solution: Bitcoin and his "kidcoins". And this will explode from a day to another.

Live on BTC means, you are paid for your work in BTC, you pay with BTC for your expenses, so no fiat used in all these "trades". **IT IS a primary medium of exchange for me**.  
And I'm not an exception, there are others like me out there, even if they don't say it loud here. And if is possible for me IT IS possible also for others.  
The Bitcoin Revolution just started...

Because other "use case" imply use of fiat. Fiat and all his "financial services" is dying, slowly but continuously. Who do not want to see that, will cry later. Fiat is history and our children and granchildren will learn about fiat in history books. So why should I care about other "use cases" of fiat?  
Just because your case of using Bitcoin failed, doesn't mean anybody else will fail. We are many, you are only one.

I never tip (BTC is too valuable for me), I never give away BTC. If I teach somebody about BTC I never give him BTC, I sell him yes (but not for goat shit fiat).  
Instead I give away worthless goat shit fiat bills. Because I don't use them anymore :)  
Now I have long time "nonbelievers" that are coming back to me to teach them about BTC. I told them they have to pay me in BTC for those services. 99% accept it. I teach them how to buy, first, to pay me, then teach them the rest. Everybody is happy now!

There is no "best" wallet. All mobile wallets are almost the same, the difference is which one fits/like more for your usage.  
I have and use on daily basis (the order doesn't matter):  
Electrum - nice that you can use same wallet files on desktop and mobile  
Mycelium - I use the same passphrase on Electrum desktop wallet too  
Schildbach - one of the first mobile wallets, simple and easy to use  
Airbitz - works great linked with Bitwage, nice merchant directory  
BCI - I have a vanitygen address on it, also in an Electrum desktop wallet  
Xapo - is linked with a plastic card (used very few times, but just in case)  
Wiper - is a HD wallet linked with that chat app, easy to send/receive BTC from friends, chatting.  
All wallets backed up the keys in a separate repository, safe. If I lose it/stoled I can have immediately access to all my wallets from other ways. All wallets are PIN protected and never keep too much on them, just change or quick spends.  
Of course the mobile is clean and **encrypted**. Never use it for stupid things, social media, FB, games and other BS. Just BTC, calls, some Telegram/Wiper chat, emails and few basics things.
@_date: 2016-06-08 09:15:22
Hahaha... "in the future". The actual fiat is virtual/imaginary from many years (when the gold standard was no longer a standard).  
Any money you borrow from a bank was virtual money (they don't exist). How many of you try to take cash the credit you just borrow from a bank? They will never give you cash, just some numbers in a bank account. If you request those money in cash they will have to print them, borrow them from others etc, they don't have them in their bank.  
FIAT is a big LIE!

Nope are not stupid. Miners can't have "profit" at actual price. Thay have to sell at least $800 in order to keep actual profitability. Once will hit 800 media will woke up and make a paranoia articles about "pricemania" and will bring more attention from noobs. Then will be chaos until $1000 end of this year and slow down the between 900 - 1100. If more people will wake up, price will hike again and from that point, nothing can be stopped. Banks will crash and fiat will be obsolete. Sorry banksters but your end is near... than you think.

Today the "normal exchanges" are just a transition and/or a tool for speculators. This time will pass soon. There are 2 factors that will "kill" them:   
- govs will push more and more regulations (that will push them out or their clients will not accepte it anymore)  
- P2P exchanges that will popup like mushrooms soon.  
From now on many things will start to be decentralized and P2P, you will see. In 2-3 years few things will still be "centralized"... Like Andreas said: Bitcoin will change the world dramatically.

There is no such a thing of "bitcoin debit card". All those you mention are fiat debit cards, all are VISA cards. Bitcoin can't be debited, just owned.

Don't get drunk with water. Paypal letting you to buy/sell BTC using their services is just the prove that they are DESPERATE of losing terrain and just want some pieces of pie...  
Let's be clear, paypal will NEVER integrate payments with BTC because will be a nonsense. Why should I move my BTC to a paypal account and pay fees and get funds seized, when I just have to use my BTC wallet.  
Remember WHY Bitcoin take over back in 2010?! I think everybody forget that important thing: Wikileaks get paypal and VISA account blocked so they started to accept BTC!  
History will always repeat... They are done! Banksters, paypal, visa, mastercard all of them are scared, desperate and with shit in their pants!

But also if we let the miners to "dictate" the market fee will end up in being more expensive than banking or worst. So for that I will always pay a minimum fee and not feed the greed of miners. because this "market fee" is just greed nothing more.

Is not about markets. Is about the real price of mining BTC these days. Miners can't sell anymore BTC at the level of 400-500-600USD but to a double price. Otherwise they have to shutdown many facilities, will not be anymore profitable for them. Even for those that bought contract electricity in advance.  
Only after that the "market effect" will take place, when people will see that the price is rising to incredible levels, will follow like sheeps and buy, so the price will go even higher. At that level nobody knows where the price goes... but one thing is certain: **Bitcoin can't be stopped**.
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:08:19
Govs tried to stop BTC from the first day. Remember that in early days, Gavin goes to CIA and who knows what he told them? That was the first "interaction", that we know it, between Bitcoin and gov.  
I am sure that they get it from the first time and they think like: "oh man, this is going to blow up the whole shit we tried sell to the world like the only one best solution, we have to do something to stop it. But hey we can't stop it, WE ARE FUCKED!"

2 things about Coinbase. Before use it or keep fund in there:  
-   
-   
The term "cash out" BTC is a nonsense. Bitcoin is NOT a stock, bond or whatever you consider an investement. Is YOUR property. Is YOUR money, Is YOUR bank.  
Bitcoin is the future of your children and grandchildren. Giving away now, you just fucked up their future. Think twice about it.  
Don't think I am right ? Then watch this: 
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:47:13

In addition to this, noobs, repeat this every day: 
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:01:17
Never heard about BitChex and I will never use an web/online wallet other than mine (mobile or desktop).  
I used BitWage and Cashila sometimes to receive some payments from fiat into BTC, but I never keep my bitcoins in those wallets more than few minutes or hours. I move them to my wallets immediately I can. Then those bitcoins I exchange them through shapeshift.io into other altcoins and back to BTC to new generated addresses, so the payer will never know my real wallet.  
"No protection for fraudulent purchases either" - WTF means that? If I would buy BTC I would use bitsquare.io (P2P decentralized exchange) and nothing else. But I don't anymore to buy BTC, because I earn them. And I never sell them into fiat. I just use them from my wallets.  
I think you are quite confused about how Bitcoin really works.

I have another strategy (totally at reverse): I give away the fiat cash (but I don't have anymore) saying that worth nothing for me. And make BTC more "desired", not giving away... making it more valuable than goat shit fiat.
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:38:38
Periodically I use to exchange my BTC into LTC using shapeshift.io and back to BTC into new created address. Also spreading to many new addresses if is a big amount.  
For example I receive my salary in 1 BTC address, that payment I exchange it into LTC and back to BTC spread it into many new addresses or even another wallet. When I exchange it in LTC I also use many txs not only one, big. Yes this have an inconvenient: many fees and satoshis lost.... but is a good way to hide your stash.

Thanks for your good intention, but I would suggest you to be more careful with your "tips". BTC is became too much valuable to be given away. Soon you will regret each satoshis you throw away.  
My daughter's wallet is just OK with the amount of BTC she have. Few time ago she run a webshop by herself, selling only on BTC some girly stuff. And she made some good sales. Now the shop is closed because she's too busy with school and other stuff.  
I understand your good intentions but I am not looking for more BTC that I have. I mined from 2012 until 2014, I bought at any price, from 2015 I earn ONLY BTC, I spend BTC and I HODL. Me and my daughter we have enough to live free and without any more hassle. Soon I can retire with my stash :) and my daughter finish her school. I don't want to be rich, I just want to live free and in peace with enough money that I would not have to struggle.

- gov apparatus - 99% out, obsolete  
- huge unnecessary spending (like military complex budgets) - out, you can't fund wars with LIMITED money, nobody will give their money to fund wars  
- voting - we will not vote persons, leaders, parties, but projects, ideas, things that matter for our society, direct democracy, voting with your money  
- taxes - forced taxation ([theft]( will be obsolete, will have voluntary taxation, people will put more money into their local/regional community, where they decide directly what to do with the money collected  
and the list goes on and on and on....

Then you should start looking for another supermarket.  
I use to buy a lot online. If a merchant is not showing Bitcoin accepted I contact the customer service and I ask nicely if I can pay with Bitcoin. If they say they don't accept yet, I ask for a bank transfer and I pay with cashila (in BTC). Some of them they accept BTC even if they still don't have it on their web ready.  
But most of them already accept it. Many many products you can find here   
I live on BTC for more than a year and yes is possible, with patience and dedication.  
There is no way back for me to fiat. I don't want it anymore. I closed all my bank accounts long time ago.

All the "social media focus on privacy and security" will do exactly opposite: will sell my data to CIA/NSA/or whatever other spyware program.  
And that's the beauty of Bitcoin: it hides your identity from "social media" thefts. I am NOT for sale!  
And the tile is meaningless. None of the BTC projects will "bring bitcoin to the masses". This is a typical marketing BS to fool sheeple (like they are not enough stupid).  
Bitcoin will be adopted ONLY when people will demand to be paid in BTC. There is no other way!
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:27:04
In few words, here are the steps:  
- Dec 2014 Start pushing all my clients (I am IT freelancer) to pay my services in BTC  
- Jan 2015 my first client pays me in BTC (wallet to wallet)  
- Feb 2015 other clients start paying me through cashila (they send fiat to cashila bank account and I receive BTC)  
- Feb 2015 start convincing my landlord to accept the rent in BTC. He accept it starting with the next month payment  
- Mar 2015 closed all my bank accounts and plastic cards. I still have a residual to pay for car buy credit but that I still pay using a friend: he pays monthly in fiat from his bank account and I give him BTC accordingly. He want to slowly get in Bitcoin train so this is a win-win situation.  
From this moment I live exclusively on BTC, paying directly with my BTC wallet or using cashila/mycelium to pay fiat bills. With patience and dedication I found/convinced online merchants that will accept BTC for my regular shopping. I convinced some other local merchants from my community and now many people here are using BTC. Besides that many people say that they can't find places where to spend their BTC, I have an opposite opinion/experience: there are many merchants that will not announce it with drums and press release, they just accept it. You just have to ask or look closer.  
"The secret" of large adoption is not mainstream media or gov or big companies that announce that accept BTC. The important thing is to start small, from your local community and go further...  
It is possible to live on BTC but first of all you need to be prepared mentally. Getting rid of fiat is not a easy step, many people can't even imagine a world without fiat. For me is just history.  
Yes many will say that I'm lucky, but I think we all have to look for our "luck" and build something around us, in our community and not wait for other to do things for us. It's easy to say BTC is not adopted but you don't do anything about that and some people even do opposite - use the so named "bitcoin debit cards", that are killing the BTC adoption. BTC adoption means you use YOUR OWN BANK, YOUR OWN BTC WALLET.
@_date: 2016-06-22 09:16:09
A "bitcoin bank" is from start a failure and a nonsense.

Be Your Own Bank = use your own BTC wallet, do not trust anybody in keeping YOUR money!  
Bitcoin will change totally our world as we know it! And will start making the banks OBSOLETE. Everything will be P2P! No more bloodsuckers.
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:15:10
I have more than 60% of expenses paid in BTC, with no exchange involved in the process (by me or 3rd party). This is a "preparation" for when all merchants, companies etc will accept BTC or any other crypto.  
Changing the mentality to "**no fiat accepted here**" is a big step.  
I know that using services like cashila &amp; co. is not a real BTC economy but at least is moving me far away from getting in touch with banks and fiat. Going back to plastic vards will never move away from "fiat mentality" and will make even harder the process of BTC acceptance.  
I don't see many here that make this step to demand to be paid in BTC and try to make more and more expenses in BTC. It's easy to say, ah we don't have 100% acceptance so we have to use plastic cards, but not doing anything for NOT using those cards and banks.  
The bigger step in BTC acceptance is to be paid in BTC, demand to be paid in BTC. In this way you move the "problem" of obtaining BTC to the company that pays you, so you push them to accept BTC for their services/products so you already moving the wheel in the right direction.

I see only pictures and videos (title says "statistics" but nothing in there) but not facts, no guides, no success stories, no failed cases (sometimes we have to present failures to learn from them).  
Sorry guys, I am a huge fan of Bitcoin, but I see this website just like a hipsters site (infinite scroll down for nothing), showing how cool is using Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not just "how cool it is to pay with it"·, is much more than just that. Nothing interesting on that site...  
Show me:  
- statistics, how many of people are receiving salaries in BTC, and that will give a REAL measure of how much BTC is spend in Arnhem...  
- how many merchants are having door stickers saying: "Sorry no FIAT accepted here"  
- what BTC payment methods are using those merchants, what features, problems, failures, success they had. Experiences. Opinions from REAL people.  
- REAL opinions from people that use BTC in Arnhem.

A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them.  
The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Downvoting this opinion means you are supporting VISA and the banksters! Or at least say why you downvoted it.

**BITCOIN DOESN'T NEED PERMISSION OR LAW FROM ANY GOV, TO BE USED!** Stick this into your mind!  
Those "laws" of ban or recognize the right to use are just BS, to give you the illusion that gov is the only one to be trusted and the one that is giving you any permission to your rights.  
Like trully said: "Rights aren't rights if they can be taken away" I will add to that: You can't give a "right to use" of something that you can't control.  
People have the rights, govs have ONLY the permission from people... Govs CANNOT give a right to the people because doesn't have it in the first place.  
A society where gov "give rights" is a society of slavery...  
So do not get drunk with water, this is not good news, this is just how govs is playing with your mind.

Don't waste your time with those that doesn't take BTC or don't want to listen. There are many others that will be happy to work for BTC.  
I live on BTC for more than a year (freelancer) and I convinced many of my clients to PAY ME in BTC. Now they are happy to do that and some of them are real bitcoiners also.  
In this moment/phase, Bitcoin is not for everybody, is just for those who will listen and do what is important: start using BTC. I stopped working with those clients that are against paying with BTC or even not wanted to pay through Bitwage or cashila. I will not waste more time with "squareheads"...

For me the most important thing is that I NEVER have to use a bank account.  
FUCK THE BANKS! Enough is enough!
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:08:50
You always can use a P2P decentralized exchange like bitsquare.io and not have to follow their rules.  
Coinbase is more than just an exchange that is following the gov rules, is the banksters tool to track you, to slow you down in fully adopting BTC.  
I will remind you this:   
If you don't understand what that means, I will translate for you: Banksters will never put their money in something that they can't control it...

When you ask "do you accept BTC" sounds like begging. I never used that question. I was using the way around, making the fiat looks like worthless shit and Bitcoin like a desired item/money. An example: you can ask to give you the change in BTC or say keep the change is worthless for me, I use Bitcoin instead.

I see that today society need "edgies" to think for the rest of society, because people are dormant, can't be capable to think for themselves and just do what their masters says... anything else is out of ordinary and no matter is should not be "accepted"...  
I am sick and tired to be the masters slave! I can think and do things by myself. So I started with using Bitcoin and close all my bank accounts This is my fight against tyranny, against banksters, against modern slavery!

Yes you are right. I applied already what you just said: if I see that people are just don't get it from first time, I leave them alone, not even mention again about Bitcoin.  
But here, when you see the amount of newbies that have no idea about what they are going to experience, it gives me more energy to rant (sometimes maybe too much for nothing), but anyway is a form of expression.  
Sometimes I have this internal thoughts that stop me: STFU and do not tell to sheeple anything, keep it for you, more for you less for them. I have to listen more often those thoughts, better for me :)

There is NO alternative to Bitcoin. A better explanation here: 
@_date: 2016-06-09 08:06:59
Exactly that I said, but matter how many BTC you have not how much worth in whatever other currency.  
I think those who really want to have a wealth measurement maybe they can refer to gold/btc exchange. That will be a more reasonable "to the moon" level, not comparing with fiat.

I never give away bitcoins. Are too valuable. Instead I give away fiat bills - are worthless goat shit.  
My friends, I invited long time ago to join to Bitcoin Revolution and they refused, saying that is BS. Now when they want to join, they will have to pay me to explain it and also to buy BTC. Some they already did that and they appreciate much more the Bitcoin.  
People should not give away BTC, later they will regret it sooooo much!  
Normally NOBODY is giving away gold jewelry, just because they don't use them anymore... but used clothes, shoes, furniture etc. Exactly the same we have to do with fiat bills: give them away to those who still can do something with it.   
Giving away BTC is like throwing on the window your gold jewels... Thinks again!
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:56:48
That's the beauty of Bitcoin: you can consider it whatever you like: money, currency, bonds, stocks, digital gold etc. But something is in particular: **something valuable that your gov can never take it, seize it or tax it.**

Not only having access to your private keys, but can seize, close your access to your funds, track you, share that tracking info with "3rd parties", anything that a bank will do with your fiat money.  
The link from BBVA bank say it all: a big bank funding a "bitcoin company", you really think they do it just for some profit? No way! They do it to be able to track the bitcoin users and slow down the full adoption of Bitcoin.  
No only I would suggest to not keep any satoshi in that Coinbase account, but not using at all.  
You want to buy/sell BTC? Use a P2P exchange (bitsquare.io), in person trade (mycelium) or localbitcoins. Do not let govs to track you down in any way.  
You said "The reason I use Coinbase is that they make it easy to connect" - then you just "trade" your privacy for a "easy way to connect".  
Satoshi create Bitcoin just to give you more financial privacy, but you are going back to using banksters tools that will strip you off your privacy.

Ah ok, sorry for misunderstanding then. There are many others webs for BTC freelancing.  
But also you can always try to demand to be paid in BTC for your work, even if you are not a freelancer. You can use in the first stage bitwage.com, cashila.com, bitwa.la to get your salary from your employer and you receive BTC in your wallet. The employer will just have to make normal bank transfer instead of your bank account, into those service providers bank accounts, with a dedicated tx reference linked to your account.  
Then demand a direct BTC payment from your employer, when you convince the boss that is better for the company to use BTC.  
Also now you can even sell your services for BTC using [OpenBazaar](

Bitcoin and open blockchains will change/disrupt a lot of things in our society, believe it or not, it will happen:  
- politicians - out, obsolete  
- gov apparatus - 99% out, obsolete  
- huge unnecessary spending (like military complex budgets) - out, you can't fund wars with LIMITED money, nobody will give their money to fund wars  
- voting - we will not vote persons, leaders, parties, but projects, ideas, things that matter for our society, direct democracy, voting with your money  
- taxes - forced taxation (theft) will be obsolete, will have voluntary taxation, people will put more money into their local/regional community, where they decide directly what to do with the money collected  
And the list goes on and on and on....

There will be a lot innovations from now on. Including more "security" and "anonymity" for your BTC wallets/addresses.  
Personally I would love to see a "feature" for wallets like, when somebody force you to give up your private keys/passpharse of a wallet, in the moment you put a special dedicated passphrase (not the real one) the funds get instant moved to another address out of that wallet, so the "perpetrators" will get nothing, dust.  
I still don't get it how for example the feds get "seized" the SR-DPR coins. So, they have a keyloger on Ross computer, they force him to give up the keys or what?  
If I would be a "bad guy" I will make anything to protect those btc. I can even create a wallet that I will never know the entire passphrase so even if they will inject me with a "truth serum" I can't give them the access. So they get shit anyway.

This term "bitcoins seized" is a BS media creation, to scare noobs do not use BTC because can be seized easily. That's a lie!  
Let's have a case with a worst case scenario:  
A bad guy selling drugs, guns, child porn etc is catched and all he have is a wallet. No cash no nothing.  
What if in the moment is catched, another trusted person (yeah I know is a rare case) will just wipe the wallet to many different addresses? The gov agents gets NOTHING.  
I am 199% sure that in few years we will have the state of the art wallet design, with an anti-theft feature: once you put a special code instead of your regular passphrase, the funds gets wiped to another wallets. So kiss my ass feds!  
Even then I will never, ever give up my bitcoins, NEVER! Are MY PROPERTY!

Any "online wallet" that you do not control 100% your keys, someday, will be hacked, seized, closed, disappeared or whatever other reason that you will not be able to take your money out.  
People should start understanding ONE important thing: Bitcoin is about ownership, is not like fiat IOUs papers. You have the keys you own it, you don't have the keys, you don't own it. Point and simple.  
A great quote for this:

We are still in the learning and developing time. Bitcoin, in order to be mass adopted/used, need a change of mentality first, learning a lot about it and needs lots of apps, usages, niches where will have to penetrate and move things.  
Do you like Bitcoin and want to be adopted more? Demand to be paid in BTC, work for bitcoins. That is a starting point that will move things. Not the way around to wait until merchants will accept BTC payments. When people will have more BTC than fiat to spend, merchants will be attracted and will want those BTC.

Is not true. I'm a freelancer and I convinced all my clients to pay me in BTC. Nothing will stop you to work like a freelancer inside a company. Is just another form of selling your work time. Bitwage and Cashila are doing a great job in this matter (receiving BTC instead of fiat for your salary, no need a bank account in your name).  
Nothing can stop you to convince your landlord to pay him the rent in BTC. Is just a matter of convincing.  
Utilities and other bills in fiat I pay easily with: cashila, bitwala, bitbill etc. I'm sure are many others out there.  
Groceries, I convinced my local ones to accept BTC from me, now they accept BTC from many other clients. Every day are more and more small shops that accept BTC. Is just a matter of looking closer and ask nicely, explain why you want to pay in BTC. Once they realize that in order to sell more they will have to accept BTC also, they will do it.  
Just waiting with your BTC for other merchants to accept them will not gonna happen.  
There is a town in Switzerland that the local authorities are already accepting BTC, so the things are moving towards real acceptance.  
Where I live, a small community, also there are many merchants that already accept BTC. And this will spread every day, just because people are talking each other and doing something for their good, not waiting for their gov to do something for them.

I live on BTC for more than a year and here is my "way" to lose track of my coins.  
I am paid monthly to a BTC address that I generate every time I have to charge my clients. Never the same.  
Once I received the payments, I send those BTC to a shapeshift.io exchange order into another altcoin. Then I exchange it back to some bunch of new generated BTC address (sometimes even another wallet). So I split the original "income" into more inputs and the "original" address where I received the payment is empty and the payer will never know what I did with those coins.  
If you are well organized you can even have a small "profit" from the exchange rates BTC-ALT and ALT-BTC.  
I strongly suggest you do not use anymore Coinbase. [Is a banksters tool to track everybody is using BTC]( Try to use as much as possible P2P exchanges like bitsquare.io - nobody will track you, ask you for your IDs and other stupid KYC, you are always in control of all your money.

Why should I pay taxes (aka modern slavery)? So that the govs will fund military companies with my money, fund wars, fund all those unnecessary expenses for the community, fund politicians and bailout banksters? Hell no!  
I will understand I have to pay a voluntary tax when is about to be built something good for my community, for my region etc. But not a gun pointed taxing to fund things that I will never agree to pay.

This is a fight for survival and govs and banksters know that and will do everything possible to slow it down (full adoption). The exchanges are a friction point where govs and banksters can trace those who use Bitcoin for whatever reason.

Bitcoins always stays on the blockchain. You can't "take" them from there and "store" in a box/vault/cave etc.  
What you are storing is your KEYS to open that wallet. The keys (private keys) are in a format of digital string/ QR code/ passphrase. This is what you have to store "offline". By offline you mean: not connected to internet or saved in a computer file. This can be a hardware wallet, paper wallet (QR code), steel wallet (passphrase embedded in steel) or just an encrypted USB drive with encrypted wallet files backups.
@_date: 2016-06-10 09:18:48
I will explain my way to lose track.  
I live on BTC for more than a year. Yes I am paid 100% in BTC so I receive 1 payment to 1 BTC address. Each time I use a new address but that is not enough.  
So I use Shapeshift.io to exchange (by small parts) into LTC and then back to BTC, but to new generated addresses and even another wallet.  
So in this way who pays me BTC (employer, client etc) can't link those coins to me forever.
@_date: 2016-06-19 12:30:07

It is possible a society based on direct democracy. People can vote directly projects (with a solution based on blockchain) needed for society, but first they will vote for projects near them, in their community or region.  
Many will say that not all people will understand all the aspects of those projects and they are right. And here we have a place for professional politicians/specialists in explaining/debating those projects so the majority of population can know for what they are voting.  
What we have now, is a system of lies, of thefts, of deceiving, of slavery. Enough is enough! Right now we are voting only puppets, that have nothing to do with our demands, desires, needs. The actual politicians that have to represent us, are in fact doing "others" needs, even against our demands. This is not democracy, this is fascism.  
Thomas Jefferson said: "When the people fear the government, is tyranny, when the government fear the people, is freedom". Ask yourself: what we have today? Freedom or tyranny?

Use cashila.com or bitwa.la or bitwage.com to get your salary in BTC. Your company can pay to a regular bank account (of one of those mentioned) and you get BTC into your wallet.  
Regarding gas payment and other things, the most important is to make others to accept it. First is the mentality to change. I know is hard, but once you close your bank accounts, you really feel a freeman and you will have to start paying ONLY in BTC.  
I will never say that moving to live on BTC is easy. Not at all, is really hard, but once you start it never stop. And everyday it gets easier. We have to change our regular habits! We get used to have all we wanted with a swipe of a plastic card, but we never think about consequences of doing that. DEBT slave to banksters...

You said very nicely "obtained". The correct words will be squeeze you (illegally) to give up the keys.  
Yep, stupid people will always exist end they will be presented like an example, but in wrong way (like "do like them and we will catch you").  
BTW storing your wallet in a safety deposit box is a REALLY STUPID IDEA! Putting your paper wallet in a bank deposit box is like giving up to feds your keys before you get caught. Same for people that keep their backup keys in the cloud storage. You can store your secret wallet in many other different places but NOT in a bank!

As I said many times here (see my history), brexit does NOTHING to do with BTC.   
Real bitcoiners don't give a fuck about brexit. The rest of people also don't give a fuck about BTC because they are too dumb to understand the disruptive power of Bitcoin. So they will be the losers in the end.  
Brexit/bremain is huge hoax, all was decided long before you think/vote. Stop relating Bitcoin with these hoaxes, Bitcoin give a fuck to these "events". Bitcoin is following his steady path to freedom.  
Relating Bitcoin with any financial, economic, social movement shows exactly that some others are using it ONLY like a speculation tool. Do not fall into their trap. If you are trapped into this "bitcoin investment" rollecoaster you are lost and you are missing the whole point of Bitcoin.  
[As Andreas said in this amazing presentation]( Invest in your education regarding Bitcoin, not in speculation.

I don't see it like "embarrassing question" and also I see that you already have something in mind very well structured. Good move for you.  
I can't "promote" you a best wallet or solution, because every person that is using Bitcoin have his own "favorite" wallet. You should try some of the most used and see which one is good for you and your habits.  
Here you have some:  
- hardware wallets: Trezor, Ledger, Keepkey  
- desktop: Electrum (you can keep a wallet file on a USB encrypted and open it when you want, anywhere), Multibit  
- mobile: Electrum (you can use same wallet file from desktop version), Mycelium, Schildbach (one of the 1st mobile wallets), Airbitz, BCI.  
- online wallets: NONE

Miners are the main sellers, they are first ones getting BTC. Of course they hold some, but they have to sell also many BTC to pay the mining costs.

Why should I care? How a taxman would know how much I have in a many of my wallets? Is his problem to solve this  not mine. When I will see a gov paper saying: you own x amount of BTC and you have to pay x amount of BTC tax (in BTC) then maybe will be my concern, but until then... FUCK THEM! Anyway taxing is a theft...

You don't have to be a "believer".   
**Just only 1 fact: Bitcoin can't be seized** and makes it **very attractive**.  
Because, what is going on these days in the whole world, is following by a **BIG SEIZURE** of all capitals.... Who doesn't see this coming, is a fool, a sheeple, a slave, a robot, an ignorant, a thing that doesn't deserve attention...  
It's not about making money, profit, it's about **SECURING YOUR FUTURE**.  
For much you learn/know/use about Bitcoin, that much you became a freeman, you secure your future.  
Watch/listen this every day, until you really understand the implications/disruptions of Bitcoin:   
**Satoshi stole the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and gave it to the people - this is one of the biggest evolutionary step for entire humanity**.  
**Ask yourself this question: What would happen if some few "cavemans" would control the fire?** Same happen with Bitcoin...

There are many ways to integrate an API code in your website.  
But using a closed code of the website (squarespace) is not really recommended for BTC. I suggest to make your own website code or use WP + Woocommerce + BTC plugins. Much easier and safe to manage the web.  
I use with success on WP Woocommerce this one  All payments goes directly to my Electrum wallet, no hassle, no intermediary, no exchanges, pure money.  
BTW, I don't even trust a hosting company, I use my own hosting server. Nowadays is cheap to have a good internet bandwidth. A web server can be even a Qnap box.  
You should try also OpenBazaar. Open a shop there and in your actual squarespace web, put a link to that OB shop for BTC payments. Make the squarespace to be just the presentation pages but when is about to pay use OB page.

I wonder what they "celebrate" and discuss to that conference, because according to [this video]( in Amsterdam there is **no use of BTC**.  
Is really strange to NOT see Amsterdam like a Bitcoin capital...  
Now, there are 2 possible explanations:  
- at that conference they discuss anything else but **NOT** about Bitcoin and ways to be adopted.  
- or this conference is just about bla-bla discussions but doing nothing to help BTC adoption in Amsterdam  
So guys from bitcoinwednesday.com, please can you explain why there is no merchant that accept BTC in Amsterdam (according to that video)?  
According to coinmap.org there are 46 merchants posted. Are they still accept BTC?  
According to your website:  
**Mission**  
Bitcoin Wednesday aims to be an open and objective monthly conference for exploring all sides of the ongoing debate about the expanding influence of the digital currency revolution on society. Our primary goals are:  
1. To position The Netherlands as one of the world’s leading countries in digital currency innovation; and  
2. To educate and raise awareness of the broad applications of digital currency technology  
With so much "raising awareness" every month and educate people, we should see Bitcoin flourishing in Amsterdam... but [these guys]( say that there is no way to use BTC in Amsterdam

Nope. Nope. Nope. Brexit or No Brexit is a total manipulation and does nothing to do with BTC.  
You really think is your choice to exit or not? Hahahaha those times of democracy are gone long time ago my friend... Bitcoin is the only hope to get rid of these vampires politicians so you will really don't care about EU or not. EU will be meaningless...  
So you better be quiet, but more BTC and wait until you will LOL to all those sheeple that believe they can change something and not using BTC.  
Bitcoin will change the world, not your vote for a meaningless referendum. Bitcoin will give you power to kick out the politicians that suck your blood and crush the banksters that enslave you! Because when more and more people will use only BTC and not their worthless goat shit fiat, they will lose the power of enslavement. And you will decide what is good or not for you and your community.

3. If you are looking for a job start looking only for the jobs that PAYS in BTC. Then you have your future insured.  
4. Start learning about Bitcoin. This will change the world as we know it. You can start with Andreas. A presentations:  and reading his book

- why blockchain.info need a commercial?  
- why is saying "for few cents you can send money anywhere in the world" and not for few satoshis. Cents are not universal in this world. This is just an illusion created by the banksters. If we take it from them share it like this we just making their game. Those "cents" maybe are a meal for a person in Asia or Africa and worth nothing for a US citizen. We should NOT forget this!

A debit card is still a banksters tool...  
The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet**:  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Downvoting this opinion means you are supporting VISA and the banksters! Or at least say why you downvoted it.

Nope. Because Bitcoin is not IOU note, is just ownership. If you don't own it you can't spend it. Bankrupt happen when you spend more than you have.  
There are still many people that still do not understand this "ownershipity" of Bitcoin. And this is the big fucking difference between fiat and bitcoin. When people will really understand that owning bitcoins is much better freedom than having some virtual digits into a bank account, then will be the real Bitcoin revolution...

Because Bitcoin is the future of mankind...  
Forget about making quick profit from buy/sell BTC, that's total BS.  
Bitcoin is the future of our children and grandchildren.  
What we see  today happening with Bitcoin is like the early days of humans when they discover how to make and handle the fire in their cave. Those who prefer to stay out of the cave and not learn how to do the fire, they will be the losers of humanity, they became another species far less developed.  
Bitcoin will stop the wars. Why? Because you can't buy votes with bitcoins. Simple like that. A politician will NEVER have enough bitcoins to pay the voters, because he CAN'T DOUBLE SPEND like with fiat! Wars are created by banskters and politicians. [Bitcoin will make both OBSOLETE]( so wars will not have anymore funding...  
Who doesn't see the disruption power of Bitcoin, will became the "other specie of humans" lost somewhere on this planet...

Each time you use Bitcoin and not fiat, you help for destroying the military complex budget (that is the real threat to humanity and the cause of those poor orphan kids you mentioned).  
So, I live on BTC for more than a year, imagine how much I helped the humanity in this year :)  
I see many "charities" that fight against many things, but not against what causes those things.  
STOP the fucking wars and you will see how money will flow to other things that we lack.

I will tell you my "story".  
Back in 2011 I heard about Bitcoin and get interested.  
In 2012 I start mining with lots of GPUs/CPUs and cloud contracts, until 2014, when the mining get really low revenue (in my case).  
I kept all those BTC mined from then, few I spent to buy something necessary. I still have a good stash of BTC that I keep it for my daughter's future. When the time is right she will use them for her.  
From 2014 until 2015 I bought BTC from exchanges or in person, like crazy. Every time I had 20-50-100-200€ available I bought at any price, instant. And again kept them.  
From 2015 I start demanding to be paid in BTC and in the end I start receiving payment in BTC. Then I start spending only in BTC and closed all my bank accounts.  
I live on BTC, end of story.

I'm paid in BTC for more than a year.  
At the beginning the company didn't have BTC so they paid me using bitwage.com or cashila.com.  
Then they start buying BTC and paid also other employees that wanted too.  
Then they start accepting BTC for their services... and so on.  
Is just a matter of willing, not impossible thing.  
You said: "There is no service yet which automatically converts incoming fiat sales to BTC for me in real time." But there is NO NEED of that service!, you just have to insert in your online shop the option to make payments with BTC. With those BTC you pay your employees in BTC. Case closed.  
"bitcoin still completely lacks the financial products and services necessary for a closed loop system." - I live on BTC for more than year and this is a prove that you are wrong and not well informed.  
If you don't have that "will" to use Bitcoin, why you are here? Stay with your worthless goat shit fiat because you have so many "financial services", but zero freedom.  
Let me know when they will seize your bank accounts, just because they can and want... and tell me then about "financial services".

You will never sell. That fiat that is supposedly sell for will be worthless goat shit in few years. Let me tell you something:  
D today you buy a beer with $1  
- in few years when you will sell those BTC, the fiat you get will buy... a beer  
- instead if you USE those BTC to buy beer you fill up your fridge with beers for a month.  
Fiat is endless - in time the value is decreasing  
Bitcoin is limited - in time the value is increasing  
Fiat = slavery  
Bitcoin = freedom  
You are young, you should think about your future freedom not to your future "treasure" in goat shit...  
That's why I said work for bitcoins. Earn, spend and save some for later, but always use bitcoins. Dump the goat shit fiat and be free!

Yes that is a "fair" price for miners to continue mining and selling their BTC for some profit.  
I expect also $1000 until end of this year... Bitcoin will became more and more expensive for those who still didn't buy or work for bitcoins.  
I live on BTC for more than a year so for me the price is not so important. For me is always a win because is going up.

Every time when you use fiat (in any form of it) you are the master's slave... Not using at all their instrument of slavery, each of that day of not using it you will debilitate their slavery system and make them weaker and weaker.  
**Satoshi Nakamoto took the power of creating money from the banksters and give it to the people.**   
Now those people are quite dumb and instead of not using anymore banksters money (fiat), they go back and give BTC to the banksters in exchange of their fiat in form of those plastic shity antiquated cards... and not using directly their BTC wallets.  
The future is Bitcoin not fiat!
Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Let's stop this bloodsucking!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you.  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC anual fee, bank account anual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Downvoting this opinion means you are supporting VISA and the banksters! Or at least say it why you downvoted.

I'm paid in BTC to 1 BTC address, so I'm quite exposed. Then I use shapeshift.io regularly to exchange the wages received in BTC into altcoins, then back to BTC to new created addresses. Sometimes works for me even with some "profit" because of rate exchanges. If you are well organized you will never be in loss.

A friend of mine use it. I didn't because I earn BTC so for me no need to buy anymore. But my friend is happy with the experience.  
What should I say more? Is a P2P exchange, like bitcoin.de, like mycelium trade, localbitcoins. Nobody is asking for your identity, you set your exchange, make the transfer, done.  
There is nothing to worry, I think is much safer than any other exchange, because n obody is tracking you, asking you why you buy/sell BTC.

Or just watch this amazing speech: 
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:42:58
Nice. Well done! Please continue making these kind of videos about Bitcoin!  
Here an idea:  
In my opinion, Bitcoin is not "outperforming or underperforming" anything. Bitcoin is just doing his goal: change the world as we know it completely. Bitcoin doesn't care about any other currency, because are not HIS competitor, are just trash (goat shit) in his path.
Just imagine that you are Bitcoin and you are walking on a dirty road in the country of cows, goats and sheeps. You always kick some shit from them (that is fiat) and sometimes a farmer (bankster) will throw some tons of goat shit (more QEs) on your road (that is the moment when BTC price goes down) and you have to walk through that shit, but you still continue your trip. because you have a certain goal: once you walk that road, behind you, the ground start blowing of life, grass is even green, flowers everywhere, birds, trees are flourished, when before your passing everything was dirty and full of shit (from the bankster farmers that doesn't have any remorse about the nature). This flourishing life behind you are the people, companies that discover the Bitcoin and start innovations and thrive in their activity.
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:48:25
Again, Bitcoin doesn't need to be seen as legitimate or not. Is just used, nobody will force you to use it (like govs does with their fiat worthless goat shit), but in the end when you remain the last one using that worthless fiat and everybody uses Bitcoin, you will really don't care if somebody "declare" it legit or not.
@_date: 2016-06-27 13:47:20
priceless :)
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:08:27
I doubted also 2 years. I insisted, insisted and in the end the boss accepted to pay me in BTC. He bought some, pay my salary and keep the rest. Now he's a great BTC supporter.  
BTW I am amazed how people cannot imagine that is possible to be paid in BTC for your work! No wonder why BTC is not adopted, not because people can't use it but because people are afraid of Bitcoin!  
Bitcoin = freedom  
Fiat = slavery
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:08:36

@_date: 2016-06-19 08:42:33
You get it wrong. A bank's goal is not to help you with your investment, their goal is to control everything so they can enslave you forever. Banks doesn't care about money, they can create more anytime without costs for them. You will be the one that will pay. Because they are the masters...  
In this particular case of Clonebase, BBVA entered in the investment not to make profit, but to have a word in decisions of this business. Why? Because controlling from inside is easier than from outside.  
All these "problems" of Clonebase with their support and bad services are not for nothing, is a long run plan from the banksters to demise the trust in Clonebase and implicit in Bitcoin as a service.  
A noob that doesn't know anything about Bitcoin and end up with Clonebase, will have a really bad impression about how Bitcoin works and also about exchanging/using bitcoins.  
Why do you think Clonebase introduced also their SHIT plastic cards? To apart users from Bitcoin usage, to keep them in chains of using again and again that enslavement VISA cards, instead of their own BTC wallet.  
A BTC wallet is YOUR OWN BANK and banksters DO NOT WANT THAT!  
I hope now you understand why a bankster behind a Bitcoin company is a danger.
@_date: 2016-06-11 20:30:06
Hey noobs, watch out, "the halvening" will split automatically in two parts all your bitcoins: one part for you, one part for your kids. Satoshi designed this with the purpose to secure the future of your kids. Prepare from now and buy more... :)

I don't need you to believe me, that's meaningless for me. I need you to try it. Then we can exchange opinions.  
The "process" is simple: first step get paid in BTC. Start demanding to be paid in BTC.  
I start mining also in 2012 until 2014 with GPUs and cloud. That BTC stash I still have it and I HODL for my daughter's future. Then 2014 I was buying (mining was giving few) all the time I had some cash available, 20-50-100€, buy at any price. Then in 2015 I start being paid in BTC.  
The rest I explain it here:   
@_date: 2016-06-16 03:22:58
But in a normal market are 2 or more parties. In this crazy BTC fee market are only miners that "dictate" the fee level...
@_date: 2016-06-19 13:33:20
"Bored and really Horny" = very trusted, yeah...  
It was YOUR personal decission to do that not Bitcoin community or me and other people. So you have to take your OWN risks doing that. Why should I pay for your loss? Because other people died in that event/hoax/manipulation/whatever was ?  
Why every time when somebody dies we have to "donate" for that loss? How that will help bringing bag the life of those people? Is a total BS donating in these conditions. I consider it just BEGGING!
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:56:07
ETH is by far NOT a competitor for BTC. And we should not be so happy that another crypto is having problems. Any other crypto is not a "danger" to BTC but an ally. Each altcoin will do something to fulfill and help BTC to be the best one.

@_date: 2016-06-19 12:52:01
Sounds like begging and profit from an event and you decided by your own to go there instead of just stay at home and do your business.  
So....   
BTW if I would go to Belize for a holiday and my girlfriend/wife get killed by a shark, are you willing to "donate" for my loss? That makes sense for you? Is that donation brings back my GF/wife? How that will help me? And how that donation will give you a benefit or something else?  
Donations are for a common goal not for personal benefits...
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:01:43
Maybe because the world is still not wake up? Is still dormant and drugged by banksters?  
Yes maybe I am lucky, lucky that I woke up in 2011 when I read first time about Bitcoin?  
But the luck is not coming by itself, the luck is something that we are bringing with our actions, thoughts, mind etc.  
As I said many times here: BTC adoption is not something that will popup from a day to another, just because our "lovely" politicians will announce it on TV. BTC adoption come from each one of us, from our actions, decisions, disobedience against banksters and their stupid laws that force us to use their worthless fiat.  
You have to say: enough is enough! And start using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-22 09:22:50

Bitcoin is the Walking Dead of money, every time they "kill it" (see his 99 obituaries), is still walking dead over the banksters bodies...

Bitcoin and open blockchains will change/disrupt a lot of things in our society, believe it or not, it will happen:  
- politicians - out, obsolete  
- gov apparatus - 99% out, obsolete  
- huge unnecessary spending (like military complex budgets) - out, you can't fund wars with LIMITED money, nobody will give their money to fund wars  
- voting - we will not vote persons, leaders, parties, but projects, ideas, things that matter for our society, direct democracy, voting with your money  
- taxes - forced taxation (theft) will be obsolete, will have voluntary taxation, people will put more money into their local/regional community, where they decide directly what to do with the money collected  
And the list goes on and on and on...

If you use fiat in an illegal activity means that the fiat is illegal? No. Same for Bitcoin.  
A bitcoin that is not used, is on hold, is not moving from 1 address to another doesn't mean is frozen (like fiat in a bank account). Is just holding under the same owner.  
Bitcoin is owned by the person who have the keys not like fiat that is "created, moved, holded" by banks. A person will never own a fiat currency, only the central bank will be the owner of that fiat bill.  
So due to these "definitions" you have to rephrase your question.

Zero, Brexit will NOT affect Bitcoin. but... Bitcoin will affect definitely Brexit.  
Brexit/bremanin is meaningless for Bitcoin. Look at the big picture not the orchestrated hoax of this referendum. You are living in a world where democracy is just an illusion. All things are decided long time before you "vote" for them.  
Bitcoin is the only way to see the light on the other side of the tunnel. Buy/earn it, spend it, repeat. Only in this way you fucked up their plans...  
I see people happy that "because" of brexit the BTC price goes up, but all of them are missing the whole point. Banksters and globalists will never let an opportunity to impose more control over you, whatever you think you decided by "voting". They don't care what you are voting, they always have "plan" for you.  
Personally, I don't give a fuck about brexit or not. Because is a hoax and I never fear the banksters and govs. How that? Because I decided to dump their worthless goat shit fiat. Forever. I closed all my bank accounts and this is my fight against them and their plans.  
As the Bilderbergs create EU in 1955 (read the real history not google it, if you don't believe that), now they start breaking it, just to follow their own interest. Do not get drunk with water, step back and look the bigger picture. The "problem" is not that a country is part of EU, the REAL problem is that countries and people let to happen that EU became a gigantic government (that people cannot control it anymore) used in only ones interest: Bilderbergs. If citizens of EU want to be real free, they have to get rid first of that gigantic gov of EU that is NOT representing them at all. How ? Using the damn Bitcoin wallet.

I think Andreas is the type of person that will give help to all cryptos if they are in trouble. He never said "Bitcoin and only Bitcoin" but instead always he was a partisan of large types of cryptos and is logic to think like that. We need vary cryptos that will help Bitcoin to thrive.

A bankster "investing" in a Bitcoin company? You really think that a bankster will follow a profit from his "investment"? No way. Banks will always have profit so they will use the "investments" for "other" things, like control. Control of people, control of gov, control of everything.  
That's why we need Bitcoin, to get rid of all these banksters.  
Now come up the question: why we should not trust a Bitcoin company that is funded by banksters ? Because that "investment" have only one goal: to fight against Bitcoin. Banks HATE Bitcoin because they know this is the end for them. Banks will do EVERYTHING possible to slow down the adoption of Bitcoin, they can't stop it but at least they can do something to slow down. They are just in agony...

Price is a leading indicator for media attention of Bitcoin and eventual adoption by users but never will be a measure of wealth. So the whole "market cap measurement" is a BS crap illusion.  
Stop comparing Bitcoin with other currencies or stocks. There not the same.

Thank you very much for your appreciation but I will reject your tip. Not because I don't appreciate or value that amount of bitcoins (also is quite high in my opinion) but because you better use that tip to other cause, more important then me (an insignificant bitcoiner), like donating to freeross.org. Freeing Ross will be a symbol of Bitcoin Revolution, a symbol for real freedom.  
BTW, from now on people should be more careful with donations in BTC. Remember, bitcoins are limited... ? For each day 1 satoshi will increase in value. What you donate today like tip, tomorrow can be the cost of a bike, car, house or even more. So donate BTC to real a worth cause, that can help the Bitcoin community or people in general.

Yes, save your wallet file in another location, rename it for your convenience. I use to have a USB encrypted with many wallet files (from different many other wallets).  
If you are using windoze the default location for the default wallet is: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Electrum\wallets  
Then download the stand alone executable latest version and open a new default wallet. Once is open, you can go to File - Open and select your old wallet file from where you save it or from an USB. That's it.  
Don't forget to encrypt your wallet (create a password that will ask you when is about to make a tx).
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:53:32
I am a BTC user and I ALWAYS use only a 1000-5000 satoshis fee for any tx. Never had a problem with that. But never paid more to greedy miners.  
"on chain fees of $10-100 or even more" are a stupidity and never think in $ or other fiat shit. Think in satoshis, that is the real value not $$$shits

No you are not wrong, but is doing something more worse than cashila and bitwala: those bank accounts are in your name, so you are back to shit slavery tracking etc...  
You will see more and more banks like this from no on. Why? Not because banksters want to "adopt" BTC. Nooo, is because banskters in this way can slow down the adoption and easily keep you in track using their shity fiat and not your BTC wallet.  
USE YOUR OWN BTC WALLET - that will make banksters to kill themselves. Your BTC wallet is YOUR bank! You don't need their banks anymore!

Or just tell to your husband to work for bitcoins.  
I live on BTC and I have in my small town a grocery store run by a pakistani. He accept my BTC and he send them to his family in pakistan. Your husband should do the same.  
Sorry is wrong said "send them", he even don't have to send the bitcoins if he share the keys of the same wallet with his family...

My advice: please save this post for later. Hodl all your BTC you have and DO NOT talk anymore with anybody about BTC. Just do your job.  
In few years YOU will be the one that will throw vegetables to them when they will come back to you to ask if you can give them some satoshis....  
I had your experience too (but not with vegetables) and now I have some "friends" that are coming back to me asking about BTC. But now I charge them a fee in BTC to explain them. I say: sorry, few years ago my advice services about BTC was free, but now you have to pay a fee to teach you about BTC. And I have some that was paying me for that. And are really bitcoiners now. They appreciate much more Bitcoin when they have to pay for it, instead of getting it free.

Exactly, nice said "crypto vs the world not Bitcoin vs alts". We have to learn from every altcoin, from their success or fault, because together we can beat the banksters.

Never. There is NOT such thing of "bitcoin debit card". Bitcoin CANNOT be "debited".  
Stop using this nonsense term, is just misleading newbies, media and those that doesn't have patience to learn about Bitcoin.  
Say the truth: those are fiat cards and have nothing to do with Bitcoin. Visa/MC will NEVER use BTC on their plastic cards. Why ? Because it is impossible and is a total nonsense.  
Name those cards whatever you like but not "Bitcoin debit cards" because it's a lie, a total BS.  
Use your damn own BTC wallet and forget about fiat and their plastic BS cards. Be free, not an object to be tracked, squeezed, seized etc...  
Satoshi crated Bitcoin just to free people from this slavery and now people (dumb) are going back to those plastic cards.  
Satoshi give you, the people, the power to create money and you give away those money (BTC) to use the plastic cards (fiat), that Satoshi fight to release you from. Shame on you!

Look I don't want to enter in a debate with you. We are on the same side (I think).  
Can I give you an advice?  
Why don't you "make" your clients to buy your products with BTC?  
I see many that are offering discounts for buying with BTC. I think that is a bit wrong.  
I suggest instead, to raise the prices with 10-15% for those who pay with plastic cards and keep the lower price for those who pays with BTC. And put that very clear on the website so those who pay with plastic, will know WHY they pay more. So next time they will think about it.  
In order to be paid in BTC, I did that in the 1st phase, then I start rejecting all those who don't want to pay for my services in BTC.  
It's a matter of who wants/desire my services or your products. If they like it/want it, they will pay BTC, if not, are 2 explanations: my services or your products are not good or people are really dumb. I had a 10% reject rate, so with those clients I don't work anymore. soon they will come back to me.  
You sell products, I sell my services, we both sell something. For me worked, why not also for you?

You are using the word "virtual" too many times and wrongful.  
Bitcoin IS NOT virtual.  
Fiat IS virtual. Banks are creating digits WITHOUT having the real physical money. They don't have any proof that they create/mine/minted those money when you go to take a loan.  
Virtual means something that doesn't exist, an illusion, an avatar.  
With Bitcoin you have proof of exist, proof of mined so IT IS NOT virtual.  
If you like you can say that Bitcoin is a digital currency, a crypto currency but will never be "virtual".

... from a stupid/idiot BTC user that didn't encrypt/secured his wallet and/or give up his keys...  
This should be the correct title...  
The term "seize" is wrong used in case of Bitcoin.  
Seize = confiscation with no necessary need approval from the owner. And that is IMPOSSIBLE in Bitcoin case. YOU NEED approval from the owner of the BTC wallet in order to confiscate it. Then if you forced the owner to give up his keys, that means is theft with a gun point, attack, torture... so the feds will be the ones that should go to jail (in a free country, not in the USnazi...).

For example I receive my salary in 1 BTC address, that payment I exchange it into LTC and back to BTC spread it into many new addresses or even another wallet.

I use both methods. Depends the client and the circumstances. I am freelancer so I am free to use whatever I like.  
For those who still can't pay directly in BTC, I use bitwage or cashila, but I start charging 5-10% more than usual, just because they still pay in fiat (even if I receive BTC).  
For those who pay in BTC directly, is wallet to wallet, normal price, sometimes discounts (for those which we agree a price directly in BTC).  
What I recommend for those that are employees, to use for beginning bitwage or cashila. Great services. Bitwage can be linked with Airbitz wallet, cashila can be linked with mycelium (and pay fiat bills directly).

I think you are confused. Fiat IS a virtual currency. Bitcoin is not. Bitcoin is a DIGITAL currency, that means is not minted in a physical form, only digital.  
Virtual is not equal with Digital. Bitcoin always will have proof of existence, proof of stake, proof of work. Something that fiat doesn't.    
Fiat on the other side, nowadays IT IS VIRTUAL because central banks are just changing some numbers in a computer and done, they have more money, with any proof of work, proof of stake, proof of anything you like.  
Fiat is already just a IOU that worth NOTHING. So if you still trust that goat shit, good luck with that.  
Bitcoin will not replace fiat, will just make it OBSOLETE. Bitcoin will not be the only ONE currency, there will be many other cryptocurrencies but all of them will be backed by Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be the DIGITAL GOLD. There is no other way to get out of this shit we are living now.

I wonder which "community" you are talking about?  
There is no such a "Bitcoin community". The banksters took care and play the "divide and conquer" game. Even this article is "suspicious"...  
A Bitcoin community is not the one that:  
- always use Coinbase to buy BTC, so they are tracked, controlled, robbed etc. Instead of using P2P exchanges or in person trades.  
- Instead of using their BTC wallets for payments they prefer to use the so called "bitcoin debit cards", just another banksters tool that is slowing down the BTC adoption. Those are just another fiat cards, so they still using banksters tool of control. Oh but is worst, those cards are debited using their BTC so now the banskters have also more control of who is buying/selling/using BTC.  
- always look to the BTC price but never look to the Bitcoin innovations and the disruptive changes that Bitcoin will make in our society. Only speculators, the so called "traders" that doesn't care about nothing related with Bitcoin but just their quick profits. I name them: "marketcapers" :)  
- always look who is Satoshi, what he's doing with his BTC stash, those that for them Bitcoin is just another Justin Bieber in media news...  
THIS you name Bitcoin Community?  
A Bitcoin Community should the one that use exclusively BTC and look always how to improve it, create more innovations around BTC, make a life easier to the rest of the world. Just a recent example:  - this is Bitcoin!

So now the blockchain is quite stuck with many transactions that can't handle quickly, because don't have devs consensus for what we have to do to fix this shit.  
Many of those speculators use trading bots that also goes crazy in these moments of pricemania and generate tons of buy/sells transformed in txs.
Bitcoin needs these days a bit of silence not stupid waves. Bitcoin need to grow slowly, doesn't like the rollecoaster...  
In the end we are living in a crazy world, but is normal for this transition times. soon all this shit will go because Bitcoin will take over the world.

You don't need Coinbase to accept Bitcoin on your website/shop. There are many ways to take BTC directly to your BTC wallet without intermediary.  
And Coinbase is the worst one, is just another bank, maybe you forgot this:

Sorry I don't want to be rude with you. I just want to point some facts about Bitcoin that some other readers (noobs) don't know (yet). We should be careful with titles here, everything is indexed and when sombody search something about Bitcoin will get a wrong result based on our post titles.  
Exactly because that "money laundering" issue category was created Bitcoin. So you can't be stripped of YOUR money (BTC) by invoking "civil forfeiture".  
Using BTC in an "anonymously" way, you have quite some options.  
With BTC even if you do some illegal operations involving BTC txs, you can't be stripped without your consent, in any way. So BTC can't be "frozen" in any way without your consent. And BTC to be "frozen" (to use your term), needs a previous transfer of keys owner or moving them from your address to feds address (if they have one). So again need YOUR consent.  
Your question reminds me about those news articles about "seized bitcoins". For me is a lie, a nonsense. You can't seize bitcoins without consent of the owner. You have to be really stupid to make illegal operations using bitcoins and not secure them.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:04:12
BTC adoption will never happen if people are just waiting to happen.  
Start demanding to be paid in BTC, so the company will have to buy or earn those BTC. When they will see the advantages of using BTC, will start paying more employees with BTC and so on. Then more merchants will see that more and more people have BTC so they start being interested in accepting BTC.  
Waiting for your gov or local authorities to announce that "from today we accept BTC", is just an illusion. That will never happen because of a simple fact: BTC adoption will make govs to shrink to almost zero. They became obsolete in the actual form.  
So start convincing to be paid in BTC and you will see the "effect" later.

You are wrong: none of fiat plastic cards can be "loaded" with Bitcoin.  
1. Bitcoins always remain on the blockchain. Those plastic cards have nothing to do and will never have to do with Bitcoin Blockchain. are just fiat debit cards.  
2. This:  
**Those cards are not helping BTC adoption at all! The opposite, they just slow down the usage of BTC wallets and full Bitcoin adoption**.  
A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them. The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet**:  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Going back to plastic cards use, is going back to slavery masters...  
Downvoting this opinion means you are supporting VISA and the banksters! Or at least say why you downvoted it.

You forget P2P exchanges like bitsquare.io and bitcoin.de and Lycelium local trade.  
In few years P2P will explode. Just because the so called "regulated" exchanges are a friction point, where govs and banksters try to collect data, track and control those who use BTC. For later actions, who knows what their plan will be.  
Banksters will not give up so easy against Bitcoin, they know this is their end and will do everything possible to slow down the adoption.

Bitcoin doesn't need any payment gateway to be an intermediary. Bitcoin is itself a payment gateway and can be configured as itself.  
Using another intermediary for BTC payment is a violation of the definition of Bitcoin as stated in  [Satoshi's papers](  
**Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
There are many ways/plugins to setup a Bitcoin payment directly into your web using your OWN wallet not a custodial wallet.  
As a potential client for a web that uses BTC payment I will never use that merchant if I see that uses an intermediary payment platform. That means a direct violation of my financial privacy by using Bitcoin with an intermediary.

Bitcoin will change totally the way we are used to have the economy today, including loans, way of spending in general. We born with the idea that to obtain something we have to take a loan with money that we never have. That will be changed.  
I know this is hard to believe, but Bitcoin is here to do that. First thing that will be affected it will be WARS. Wars are funded with debt. In Bitcoinlandia the idea of debt (as a country) will be eliminated.  
Nobody will fund wars with their BTC (there will not be enough BTC to fund wars). Wars are funded with debts not with properties.

Good catch!  
But let's recognize that after 4 years at least their CEO has the courage and say it openly that Coinbase is not a wallet. For how much I didn't like their position until now and the fact that all new users don't know other thing then open their first "wallet" on Coinbase, I can say that I salute his step forward in saying that Coinbase is not a wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:25:41

Why people are so obsessed with taxes for their bitcoins?  
Get out from that nazi country (US) and live free in the rest of the world!  
Your US taxes are actually funding wars, bombing, CIA plots, TPPs, fake shootings, prisons etc.  
You should choose your living country by the military budget, smaller - peacefull/free, bigger - dangerous/dictatorial.  
Here is a good start  - as you can see US is like all top 5 countries combined...  
Did you asked yourself when you pay your taxes, what your gov is really doing with YOUR money?  
FUCK THE TAXES, FUCK THE BANKS, FUCK THE GOVS - Bitcoin will kick them out!

People have wrong perception of BTC wallet. Like Andreas said: A wallet is actually a keys chain, if you don't control the key, you don't control your bitcoins.  
A wallet like the one Coinbase is promoting to new users is actually a bitcoin bank account. You can control the access to that account but you never have access to your keys.

I'm prepared: years ago I paid all my debts, last year I closed all my bank accounts (I use cashila and xapo and most of the time just paying directly with my BTC wallet). I have some friends that still believe that the market is "just fine" and the ship will not sink - I laugh at them now and I will laugh at them when they will sink because they never want to listen my "warnings" and advice to buy BTC...
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:37:04
They let others to come up with this idea of an underground site (see the latest fake child porn sites owned by FBI...) and then infiltrate agents just to "manage" the data. In my opinion poor Ross was "pushed" inside so they can just have a patsy to blame. The FBI/CIA are really capable of doing this and people minds are easy to manipulate.  
People should understand one big thing: banksters, govs, politicians are scared out of shit of them because of Bitcoin come up, they know that this is the end of their "domination" and control and will do absolutely everything possible to bring down Bitcoin...

We have to show them that we are unite and let the devs to come up with a mathematical solution not a political one. Taking sides will not help in any way the future of Bitcoin...

This is always happening when try to use not trusted services to go around and not using directly bitcoin wallets (this include Coinbase shitcards etc).  
I live on bitcoin for about 1 year and never have problems like this. But I never use/trust an online wallet services and/or shitcards.  
I use directly my BTC mobile/desktop wallets and in special cases when is really impossible to pay directly with BTC I use XAPO debit card that I fund it from my other BTC wallets (I keep few BTC into that XAPO wallet). Xapo debit VISA card is taking instant coins and exchange them from my xapo BTC wallet, in the moment of payment.  
I think your bad experience with a sneaky solution to use BTC will be a lesson and start using from now ONLY BTC from your own wallet.

I am sorry for you. I hope you learned a lesson now: backup is gold. With daily backup procedure for your shared files, you just have to recover them and NEVER have to pay that shit.  
For me all these ransomware infections smell like FEDS tactic. They spread the infected files to all email servers, the victims catch it, pay the ransom and get hating Bitcoin, the general impression about Bitcoin from public is broken so they will not get into this train but they will "trust" the fedcoin, presented like the "savior" of our security because with a fedchain they can trace who did it (they know from the beginning but won't tell you).  
Guys, pay attention to these cases...  
IT admin, train your users to have wide open eyes and keep your backups up to date, don't be lazy!  
Users, don't be fooled by emails from your mom email (look like bu in fact if you look closer you will see that she never send that email). Ah and BTW, those emails from your super smart printer that is sending you your scans... are not your scans... are the infected files. So better move your ass to the printer and scan manually your documents. Printers are not "smart"...

I remember a year ago I was travelling in EU and I was wearing a Bitcoin t-shirt. The agent asked me if I have bitcoins in my bag. My answer was simple: I throw them over the border already... They searched all my bags 2 times and was nothing inside. Then they asked me why I said that and I answered: Is the truth, bitcoins are not travelling with an airplane ticket, are everywhere and cannot be stopped by any border, gov or bankster.  
They leave me to pass but in their minds who knows what shit remains about bitcoins.

I hope banksters will not "arrange" an accident to Andreas... He's touching some really hot points in his latest speeches, that are not so welcomed by banksters.  
But also I think he reached a level of audience that they will not dare to do something bad to him, will be too obvious. But also I expect in near future some "scandals" about his person, this is their usual weapon. I have a message for those "bankster media agents" that will try to denigrate Andreas: I REALLY DON'T GIVE A FUCK for your miserable techniques of manipulation. I really don't care if Andreas did something bad (whatever will be that) in his past or future. IMPORTANT is his fight to promote Bitcoin and freedom from you fucking banksters!

Actually I became a bit greedy. In the past I was "promoting" BTC to all my friends and well known. some of them follow my advice and jumped in this train. I have even one of them that after 2 years of bothering him he finally jumped in and after few months he realized that he's earning more and more from using it. Now he decided to pay 50-50 all his earnings from BTC with me.  
But in the last 6-8 months I stopped promoting BTC and I follow my path to earn/use/hodl and not saying any word to others. Because I realized that each one of new comers will take "my share" of 21 millions. Every day are less and less to mine so we have to be careful with that...  
I know is a bit stupid idea but this is my way.

You can deceive new possible users for Bitcoin, you can make actual bitcoiners to go away, you can bring down the exchange rate but you can never convince me to shut down my hidden nodes and miners.... NEVER!  
So your "Green Beret plan" will not achieve the final goal.  
Ah BTW, like me for sure will be more "crazy" persons that will not shut down their bitcoin machines, just for fun :)

Another one: try to use Andreas famous phrases. here are some:

And expect more scenarios like this in the near future. Banksters knows now that they can't shut down Bitcoin but they will try all possible to bring down the confidence and the image of Bitcoin so they can bring their fedcoin like the "salvation" of the "collapse". Even these "debates" inside the Bitcoin community have a huge suspicion that was orcherstrated by feds ... divide and conquer like usual they do

I live for about a year on BTC but I started when I had the first salary paid in BTC exclusively. Then I closed all my bank accounts and start living happy...  
What they are trying to do in that pseudo-docu is to use BTC for their expenses but nothing about EARNING BTC.

They can kiss my ass from now!  
All these "divisions", "news" etc are just to scare the weak minds (aka sheeple) not to use Bitcoin, because is a terrorist instrument and your gov will make a user database, so you don't want to be in that database...  
Why they don't start that DB with the banksters - the biggest founders of terrorists (aka our govs). Here is a clue: HSBC.  
Yeah maybe Coinbase and Circle will give up their user database (they already did it) but not the real wallet providers. Even if they will  be forced, there will be immediately new wallets out there, anonymous and with no traces.   
**They are pathetic and show us the real face of the politicians - they are the banksters puppets!**  
That's why I encourage everybody to dump the fiat and use exclusively BTC, in this way we kill them from the roots.  
Hey scumbag politicians and europol buttkissers! I have a first task for you!

Wrong. Is just a bank. If the bank close the access to your account you own nothing...  
When will happen all over the world like in Greece you will not say the same. Banks will close ATM and offices and you no longer be in possession of your money. The same happen with Coinbase.  
But if you have your own wallet/bank you will be always in control of your coins...
@_date: 2016-09-09 20:01:12
The answer to your question is: how come people still believe (and click) in this shit?!

There is no such thing of "bitcoin debit cards". Bitcoin can't be "debited". Those cards are loaded with fiat not BTC. You give up your BTC for worthless goat shit fiat!  
Bitcoin was created to get out of fiat not to find a way around but still using it. It's like you are in prison and you get weekly 1 day out of prison. But you still will be a inmate for life, never be free.  
Those cards are VIOLATING your financial privacy! Your financial privacy is like your freedom of speech.  
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody will know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you have) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check

if you create a new empty wallet with the latest version of Electrum and then just open the wallet file from that USB (or copy it on your PC first) into new installed Electrum, will work.  
I suggest to open that file from a location from your PC where you have some space (maybe on your USB there is no space) and let the wallet to resync with the network (will not take too long).  
Then you will see that the wallet is OK.  
You can try this even on their mobile version of Electrum.  
I did that with a friend's wallet (he was in the same situation like you) and worked like a charm.

Yes I agree to be helpful but with people that **don't lie** or try to deceive or FUD.  
Checking the price for something means you are well informed in that something or try to read more.  
If you limit your vision of Bitcoin just on "following" the price you miss the whole point of Bitcoin, so no need to explain more.  
Don't tell me that after few years of following you still "don't get it" Bitcoin... My mom get it in few hours of talking and now at her 60+ years she's using lots of wallets and bitcoins...

Inform yourself better. Read more about Bitcoin. Don't throw yourself into the false idea that Bitcoin is the fastest way to get rich just by buying it.  
Bitcoin first of all is FREEDOM. And with freedom start all good things.  
Read these books:  and   
Watch all these talks about Bitcoin:   
You can obtain Bitcoin in 3 ways:  
- work for bitcoins (be paid in BTC for your work), there are many places where to find a job paid in BTC and many ways to be paid in BTC (cashila.com, bitwage.com, bitwa.la and many more)  
- sell something for bitcoins on OpenBazaar or many other marketplaces  
- buy bitcoins from exchanges, but remember the golden rule of Bitcoin:   
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU  
  
  
  
 - buy with cards in India  
 - nice app to buy in India  
  
  
  
  
  
And the list goes on and on...

For US you can try bitwage.com

Just send an email to some mining pools and ask if they accept that large trade directly.  
Why is so hard to believe that is possible? Exchanges are just an intermediary between miners that want/need to sell their BTC. And sometimes those exchanges are limiting the transactions and/or asking for more details for AMC/KYC. I don't think a miner will ask too many questions.

That's not Bitcoin adoption. Is just business as usual with fiat cards that:  
- use the same worthless goat shit fiat that [is financing wars, corruption and slavery](  
- merchants are still ripped off with fees from intermediaries  
- customers are still tracked (by using those cards), sold, used, monitored  
- financial privacy is still violated  
- people are still age limited to use money (those cards are not allowed if you are not 18)  
- you still can be robbed, skimmed, scammed by simple fact that the plastic cards are a huge point of failure  
Bitcoin is eliminating all of these and even more.

1. "trustworthy online multi-wallet" = there is no such thing
2. Mycelium maybe will support multi currency in the near future but nothing is sure  
3. "I've used QoinPro in the past" = geeze man that is a faucet NOT a wallet!  
4. What stops you to use separate wallets? Too lazy for 2-3 more clicks? There is Electrum BTC, Electrum LTC, but Electrum DOGE I think no need such effort to develop a wallet for this :)  
5. As far I know a good multi-currency wallet is Jaxx, but that one is supporting BTC, ETH, DASH

Use the wallet that fits your necessities and you are comfortable with. Try all of them, with small amounts and then stick with the one you like it more.  
There is no such "best wallet" or if somebody famous is using x wallet that one is the one you should use it.  
Each wallet have his own specific features and functionalities, UI etc. Each one can be different than others, depending on your needs.  
Me for example, I have 4-5 mobile wallets and 2-3 desktop wallets and I use each one for a specific payment and with specific security measures.

The simple, not hassle and fast way: use a bootable USB with Tails OS (that include already Electrum) and open your wallet file (stored in wherever you like) and do txs when is needed. That Tails OS will never get "infected" because every time you boot it will be a new fresh boot and clean.  
No need to go super crazy with offline pc and stuff. If you don't use that USB/PC for other stuff online than Bitcoin tx then you don't need to go so far.  
I use to have it like that (a Tails OS bootable and a separate USB with all my wallets - encrypted) and when  I travel I can fire up my wallets in any PC I have access to boot with my USB (if is really necessary).  
2nd option: install that old laptop with any Windoze, setup your Electrum wallet and then put the DeepFreeze on it. So everytime you boot it up the DeepFreeze will bring back the configuration/state/setup you freeze it. So even if you get some malware, just boot it up and all is cleared.  
3rd option: use a damn Trezor/any HW wallet to store your big stash. Keep the change in your mobile wallets for daily small txs.  
My way (not necessary to follow): I keep the big stash on HW wallets, medium stash on desktop wallets (with many backups), small amounts on mobile wallets. Some of the mobile wallets are backed up also on desktop wallets so if I lose/get robbed of my phone I can immediately have control of my mobile wallets from desktop.

So much hassle to defend the crooks banksters.. because there is no other bankster than crooks. In the whole history of mankind banksters fooled people with their role of "a place where to put your money and get something in return". That is just an illusion. The main role of banksters is too fool people and make them slaves. See the history. Banksters ALWAYS funded both sides of wars and don't give a shit about people that deposit their money into their vaults, except other crooks and drug dealers that need protection and laundering.

I live on BTC for more than a year (but I don't live in US) and I don't see a "stagnation". I see more reticence in accepting BTC or hiding the fact that they want BTC because some of them are afraid of some consequences.  
Ask nice the retailer if they accept BTC and some will be glad to take your money.

Things to be taken in consideration by merchants:  
- NFC wallets already exist, see Airbitz, but that is not the big issue for merchants not using BTC payments.  
- to accept BTC in a shop is NOT needed ANY intermediary. Actually Bitcoin was designed to avoid any intermediary, Bitcoin is the payment platform itself.  
- merchants will setup a manager/owner wallet (Samourai/ Electrum) and a watch only wallet Sentinel for example, just for the employees.  
There are already POS systems that can integrate your own BTC wallet, [example here]( NFC is just something added, is not a norm and is not really necessary for BTC. NFC is for fucking VISA cards. BTC payment just need a QR code shown and that's it. Your POS system can read the blockchain and check the payment. No need for NFC to do that.

Useless list. Why not a list of most used BTC wallets and features. New comers need to know how to use BTC wallets not going back to those obsolete cards using fiat.  
The future is Bitcoin not fiat!  
Using a plastic card, even if si funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Let's stop this bloodsucking!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC anual fee, bank account anual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check

Even if is a stolen piece of silver, if you melt it and reshape it nobody can prove is stolen. So you win.  
How do you know if a $100 bill was stolen by the person that gave you? The fact that somebody offer you a silver bar for free why first thing you are thinking is that the bar was stolen and is not a charity? Only pennies can be given like charity?  
For me first thing I would ask: would you give me more silver bars? Because you are not having every day this opportunity of giving away silver bars on the streets. Chocolate bars you find in any supermarket like promos but not silver bars.  
And btw you have to be too dumb to not differentiate a fake silver bar than a good one. The guy that offer that bar was even willing to go to a pawn shop to check that bar... so you lose... again.

BTW a "leaked" database of 2TB than now is just 210MB is a fabricated database so is not trusted anymore. Why those papers wasn't published in a free way, raw like was obtained and was hidden public eyes for months?

Payments with BTC wallet:  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
  
Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC anual fee, bank account anual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check

I live on BTC from Jan 2015. I have used bitwage and cashila for monthly income and both works well. If you receive USD better use bitwage, if you receive EUR better use cashila.  
Yes cashila is great for paying bills, I have use it for more than 10 months with no problems, nice and easy services.  
There is also bitwa.la in EU to pay bills but I prefer more cashila.  
I pay the rent in BTC for a year and the rest of my expenses online and directly to the merchants that accept BTC.  
In Mar 2015 I closed ALL my bank accounts and never used fiat money.  
Overall you are on the right way to start with bitwage and cashila. Try to limit you usage of plastic cards associated with BTC. Try paying only in btc. I have also a XAPO card that actually is a visa card issued by a 3rd party (not xapo). That card NEVER have a fiat balance on it. When you make a visa payment is instantly making the exchange from your xapo btc account into fiat and making the payment. I use this card very few times, extremely cases and never withdraw from atm.  
To obtain fiat cash for a beer better use bit2me services. Send some btc to an address they give you a code and withdraw from many atms with no need of bank account or card, directly cash. But again, make posible to pay only on BTC.  
In this year living on BTC, I changed many of my purchasing habits and I convinced many merchants around me to accept BTC. Despite many people complaining that they don't have places where to spend their BTC, there are many places that accept BTC but are not very well known (for many reasons). In small communities BTC is very well used.  
Bitcoin revolution start from the bottom not from the top. Start from your local community the adoption, not from your government and big companies.  
Yes paying your rent in BTC is a big step, because in that moment, there are at least 2 persons in your local community, that use BTC. Next will be the bar in the corner, where both of you drink your beer. Then the grocery store from the other corner, then the bakery, then the rest of shops.  
Adoption start from your neighbors and friends not from big companies and govs.  
It's a big move to live on BTC, but also is a good start for your freedom! Plan every step and you will succeed.

Again we go back to be slaves to visa and banksters?!  
WTF is wrong with you guys? Looks like visa bought all the bitcoin exchanges/services and pushed them to offer now their plastic cards, taking the btc from the users.  
Wake up people! They are taking your bitcoins and give you worthless fiat on those cards!  
Use your BTC wallet to pay not those shity cards! In this way the bitcoins goes to merchants, merchants pay the salaries in BTC, employees start paying also in BTC so nobody will have to use anymore fiat.  
If you still use those shity cards you are going back to fiat!  
These cards are the biggest trap for bitcoiners! This is NOT good news at all for Bitcoin. This is good news for visa...

Not everybody on this planet is smart. New comers to bitcoin are smart and dumb, If you have time to spend with the dumb comers is your time not mine.  
From 2012 until now I was telling to lots of people about bitcoin. Some of them catch it from the beginning, some of them are dumb and they still don't understand it. So I wasn't spend more time with those dumb.  
Part of my work is to give consultancy to my clients and I'm talking with many people. I start thinking that bitcoin is not for everyone on this planet. Sheeple remain sheeple. Bitcoin is too valuable now for the dumb people.  
Look here a perfect example of dumb people  if you are willing to spend your time with them to make them smart and use bitcoin, good luck!

As I said: they will do everything possible to slow down the Bitcoin adoption. They can't stop it but slow down yes, until they will come up with their fedcoin, that will be hugely promoted like the only one option for brainwashed sheeple. And many will believe again another lie from them. And many of those who want to use those "bitcoin debit cards" will be also again fooled to use also the fedcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-06 08:59:33
If you are a huge supporter of those plastic cards also don't force people to use them. Making too much publicity to them you will attract also negative comments to plastic cards.  
Or at least when you post about them inform also about the pro and contra arguments so the new comers be aware of what risks should expect. Just saying that the plastic cards are the best option to use Bitcoin is misleading, because ALL plastic cards are VISA, MC etc, fiat cards and NOT Bitcoin debit cards. That means you are back to fiat anyway.  
If you don't want to use exclusively Bitcoin like others, it's your problem, stay with your fucking fiat. But others  maybe do not want to use anymore fiat.  
Let's be clear: there is NOT such thing of Bitcoin debit cards! All those are fiat debit cards. You give BTC to exchanged in fiat and then debit the card bank account. And these cards will NEVER HELP Bitcoin to be adopted. Merchants always want your most valuable money so if you still give them fiat, they will always request fiat, but if you always offer them BTC they will wake up and will desire your other money too.

99% of all these posts about "lost bitcoins" are fake &amp; shills from bankster agents. The goal? To scare the newbies and people that don't know or want to find out details about these "lost".  
If any bitcoin user have decency, will start the post &amp; title with: "I'm stupid, I get hacked, is my fault" then post details about what happen. So the community maybe can come with some help.  
All the time when I see a title like this, for me is a fake one, a big lie, made specially to scare others: buhuhu, he lost 22k, wow what a lost, we should stay away from bitcoin, is dangerous...  
But in fact even if is real is the user fault and stupidity.

I closed all my bank accounts more then a year ago and I live 100% on BTC. It is possible but depends on your desire to do that and unchain from the banksters slavery.  
You have to change a lot your habits and places to buy stuff, you need patience and understanding with merchants trying to convince them to accept btc.  
If you really want that, start with demanding to be paid in btc for your work. That will force a bit your employer to obtain btc to pay you. On one side you will not have to buy anymore, struggling with exchanges, will be your employer duty. On the other side, pushing the employer to obtain btc will go to acceptance of btc for his company (easier for him also). This is the easier way to push btc acceptance all over.  
Going to each merchant and start convincing will be much harder and with low % of success.

No need to explain. Doing this you raise more "questions" for them and they can start fabricating more "evidence" that prove nothing.  
That database we already know that is a fabricated and is not trusted anymore. If even is 1% true and you have money in some offshore accounts, is not people business. Those money are private money and people should not care about those money. If you was a public person, politician or a person that is paid from public money, Om I will understand the "worry" but being a private person is not their damn business. Is the same like linking a BTC address of 100k BTC with you. So what? You have money, what's the big deal in that? Are stolen or obtained in a legal way, also is not their damn business. If the authorities have to investigate that, also is not their damn business, is authorities business.  
Panama papers "case" is the perfect example of why we need Bitcoin and other cryptos. With Bitcoin we can trace and control public money and private money can stay private like should be.  
But panama papers are presented in media exactly the opposite: to make a case against Bitcoin, presenting it like the way to hide your money, stripping you from the last resort of privacy, financial privacy for your private money.

@_date: 2016-05-08 16:35:53
I have a xapo wallet and a plastic card associated with that account.  
I don't hate xapo, they are quite good online wallet service (of course keep in mind that you don't control private keys).  
They have an unique service with those plastic cards: you don't have to fund the card in order to use it to pay with fiat. The exchange is instant from your BTC wallet. So you will never have to care about your fiat deposits.  
But I use these services very few times because I use 99% of time only BTC wallet payments.  
What I like to xapo is that they offer many other services, with direct BTC payments: phone credits, games and other stuff that you can buy using your BTC wallet from Xapo, some with good discount.  
My opinnion is that people doesn't know well Xapo services and is not hate. Just ignorance.  
You will see every day on reddit that Coinbase is promoted all the time but few times somebody say about Xapo and basically both have same services.  
But let's not forget: Coinbase is from US, Xapo fro Switzerland... Which country is more "nazi" (tricky question)?

For me BTC is MONEY and all that matters. The rest is just manipulation.   
That fluctuation price in fiat is just for speculators that want to get quickly some money without doing nothing (working for). I think only in BTC and in future (10-20-30 years), fiat is the past...   
As I said many time, I closed all my (fiat) bank accounts so even if the BTC price will be $10000 I can't sell my BTC (that will be the stupidest thing ever).

To accept BTC in a store you don't need too much. A QR code for your wallet can be enough.

There is no such thing of "bitcoin debit cards". This term is a trojan horse!  
VISA is not using bitcoins and Bitcoin does nothing to do with VISA. These cards are FIAT cards!  
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet**:  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check

I see many zombies here that recommend Clonebase. That is definitely a place to avoid. Clonebase is a bankster's tool.

This bot really doesn't make sense. Takes the same amount of time to check my wallets. So why should I use this bot instead of just opening my wallet. Just to have my public addresses linked everywhere so making the job easier for the feds to trace my bitcoins? No way!    
Who knows, maybe this bot also is sending the same logs to feds... Linking specific btc addresses with specific telegram user is not a good way to stay private. If I just open my wallets to check the balance, that info stay only into that wallet and the blockchain. If I search my btc address   into a block explorer, that info stays in that browser session and I always control it. Limiting the friction points is making more secure your wallet info.  
You should focus on creating other types of bots more useful for bitcoin users.

I can say that are more and more people that are living ONLY on BTC now, but few you will see here on reddit say it loud. There are many "elements" that this FACT they want to be heard, because will wake up more and more people and that is not "allowed".  
Being FREE from the banksters slavery is something that still many people can't imagine, but is possible. You need strong will to do that.  
My story is quite simple. Nov-Dec 2014 I start to look in how to get rid of normal banking and start pushing to be paid in BTC by my clients (I am a freelancer). Then from Jan 2015 all my work is paid only in BTC. All those that do not wanted to pay my invoices in BTC I stop working with them. Yes is hard decision but necessary. To those that still want to pay in BTC but still they don't have the BTC, I use cashila or bitwage. So they can wire fiat and I receive BTC.  
In Mar 2015 I closed ALL MY BANK accounts and CCs. And from then I never touch fiat anymore.  
I do my shopping mostly online paying ONLY in BTC. Very few times I use my XAPO card. I quite don't like it because is still VISA, but I keep it only for urgent matter. And also is the only one that you don't have to fund it previously with fiat, is always empty and when you make the payment is making instant exchange from your xapo btc wallet (that also can be funded only when you know you will make a tx).  
Nowadays you can find quite a lot of online shops that accept BTC for your daily/monthly shopping.  
I pay my rent in BTC directly to the owner and for most of other fiat bills I use cashila to pay them.  
I really don't need anymore bank accounts.  
From March 2016 my wife also started to be paid in BTC so our life gets better and better living on BTC.  
You want to start living of BTC? Start demanding to be paid in BTC!  
FUCK THE BANKS!
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:35:06
Depends where you live and how much desire you have to use Bitcoin.  
I live in a small town, small community, where I started few years ago to promote Bitcoin. I was the first one and now is almost in any shop here. The most important thing is how smart are the people you explain about Bitcoin.  
Most of my expenses for food are online, from a local shop and part of vegetables (for daily use) I grow myself. There are many places in EU to buy online with BTC. If you really want a product and they don't accept BTC publicly on their web, try to contact them and say you want to order and pay with BTC. Some will accept and send you a BTC address for your order some not. For those that still don't want BTC, I ask for a bank transfer details and I use cashila.com and pay directly with my BTC through mycelium wallet. No bank account required, no details.  
The Bitcoin Revolution will never start if people just wait for their gov or local authorities to say "hey from today we accept BTC". People should start looking online and try to convince merchants to accept BTC, merchants to start paying their employees with the BTC they obtained from sales. Talk with people in your local community, the revolution start from low level not from high level...  
If I could do it in my community, also YOU can do it! But this depends on your desire to be free from the bankster's slavery.

I never trust a page where all persons in there are smiling. That just prove they want your money.

Bitcoin ALWAYS go to the moon so I will never be in a loss because of the price fluctuation.  
Before being paid in BTC I couldn't save some money. I was mining some BTC in early years (2011-2013) but those coins I still have them in hold, for my daughter future.  
Now I can say that I can save some money: I earn BTC, I spend BTC and I hold what remains. I live, I'm not a rich person, but I have an insurance for my future because I have hold some good amount of BTC.  
If I would save some fiat in a pension fund or something like that I would get nothing because soon the banks will take all and throw me on the street.  
With Bitcoin I have my future secure, nobody can take my bitcoins.

Because they know that is a TRAP. They offer it first time together with Bitwage (I get it in this way) like an "option" to spend your BTC until became mainstream, but is not the main goal to attract new comers to give up their BTC for fiat...

Is not "managed/traced" in the same way like the shit card.  
[Let's not forget WHO IS Clonebase]( If you still trust a bankster... I don't. Maybe for you that news doesn't mean too much but is very concerning when a bank will put money into a Bitcoin company. That means they have a good reason (to destroy/slow down the adoption of BTC or keep you again in banking slavery).  
Yes, in the end both cards are shity VISA and we should use them with caution and ONLY when is really necessary. Otherwise you have a beauty in your pocket: you own bank - BTC wallet! Or like Obola said... everybody have a Swiss bank in their pockets...

Bitcoin can't be used in other way. There is only one way to use it: from your wallet, making/receiving payments. Using those cards doesn't mean you use Bitcoin, you use fiat.  
If you want to hold your bitcoins, fine, but also you don't need VISA cards for that.  
If you want to use fiat, fine also for me. Will be more bitcoins for me.  
But DON'T promote these fucking stupid obsolete cards like the ultimate technology for Bitcoin, only an idiot will believe that.

I use for example on the site  email btcxxx (an alias of my main email address or just another separate mailbox for all the shit stuff). so when you have a leak like these you just go and close that alias or change it.

The future is Bitcoin not fiat!  
Using a plastic card, even if si funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Let's stop this bloodsucking!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC anual fee, bank account anual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
**Downvoting this opinion means you are supporting VISA and the banksters!** Or at least say it why you downvoted.

Use your BTC wallet and NOBODY will ask you for permission!  
Forget these obsolete cards! Are fiat VISA cards not Bitcoin cards. Bitcoin does nothing to do with these plastic cards. Don't let them fool you.  
If they still don't teach you what are real money in school:  
fiat = I Owe You papers = fake money endlessly printed/created by banksters = slavery  
Bitcoin = property of your money = real money that can't be double/triple/xxx times spend it = freedom  
These plastic cards are a trojan horse, to make people NOT to use BTC from their wallets and be free, but using thse stupid fucking obsolete cards that trace you, spy you, sell you and enslave you to the master banksters and their fucking fiat...

99% are lazy thinking and enough sheeple to not fight for their freedom. Bitcoin gives them freedom from banksters but they still prefer to not using exclusively btc. They complain about that don't have enough places where to spend their btc but they do nothing to find the places, to convince merchants to accept btc and most important do not demand to be paid in btc.  
The key of large adoption is not the merchants adoption, but to be paid in btc. Once a company will have to pay an employee btc, they have to buy or earn those btc. Then companies will prefer to earn (cheaper) than buying. And so on the wheel start rolling over.  
Once the merchants see that their clients have more btc than fiat immediately will switch their acceptance to btc.  
It's all about demand and offer. If you first demand, the offers will come. If you put the offer first, the demand comes way slowly than you think.  
Now regarding these plastic cards, people do not realize that the banksters are just "testing" them before launching their own fedcoin. Bitcoin is for them a perfect playground and people fall easily into this trap. Maybe today the users of these cars don't realize it but in few years they will see it (the trap).

You can do yourself a POS BTC   
There are many others out there, you just need to search for them. Even if you just start with a simple tablet and open a BTC wallet, is enough. If you want to integrate into your existing systems then is a part of digging and discussing with more providers to see which one is offering the best solution.

Yes, is true. But Xapo makes a difference: is not a debit card and is not xapo the issuer. Xapo just exchange your BTC and fw the funds to that card that pays instantly. Nothing remains on that fiat account.  
I also do not "promote" Xapo like the ONLY existing way to use BTC. This combination of xapo btc wallet/fiat payment I recommend it only for a transition period and only in extreme cases.  
A "bitcoin debit card" is when you use your BTC to deposit fiat on that card. That means the fiat exchanged stays in a bank account assigned to that card until you spend them.  
All these plastic cards (including the one named xapo card - but is not xapo) are FIAT cards and people forget too easy that. These cards wasn't created to make your spending easier, but to keep you in line with the banksters, until they will come up with their fedcoin and will fill your plastic card with endless fedcoins and get you in debt again...  
People are too dumb to think for their future in 5-10 years and for that they accept now these plastic cards like "normal" use of bitcoins.  
WRONG! Totally WRONG! People should stop using fiat in any form and use exclusively BTC wallets.

I will strongly suggest to use the P2P decentralized exchange bitsquare.io.  
bitcoin.de - P2P but not decentralized, works very well.  
anycoin.eu  
kraken.com  
cex.io  
bit2me.com - withdraw cash from ATMs  
bitboat.net - works nice but they have 9% markup  
chip-chap.com - works nice their mobile app with plastic cards  
cashila.com - pay bills also  
bitwa.la - pay bills also  
multisigna.com  
wallofcoins.com  
bitnovo.com  
coinffeine.com - P2P but not sure if is ready yet.

Welcome to Bitcoinlandia!  
I am working too in IT freelancing. And I live totally on BTC for more than a year. I closed all my bank accounts and all my clients pay me in BTC now. Is hard but it is possible. Depend on how much determination you have to do that.  
To be paid in BTC, at the beginning I used Cashila and Bitwage. So my clients paid in fiat and I receive BTC. Now most of them pay directly from their wallet to my wallet, because they start having more and more BTC. But I can say that these 2 works perfect! Definitely recommended for freelancers.  
Yes you will have issues if you use BTC daily, if you are travelling to places that never been before and do not know where to pay with BTC. In my case I do not travel too much and all my spends are in my community or online. You will have to use/rely on BTC maps like Airbitz wallert directory or coinmap.org, [Bitcoin map mobile app]( to see where you can pay with BTC.  
I never trust any web/3rd party service wallet. Point and clear. Never.   
Security measures:  
- never keep all your funds in the same wallet. Spread them across many wallets. [My example here](  
- encrypt your phone if you use mobile wallets, keep your phone clean/updated, do not install games and other BS apps.  
- backups, backups, backups  
- keep all your passwords, wallet infos into an offline password manager (never online or cloud). I have an encrypted USB stick (with copies) that keeps all my wallets, passwords etc in a password manager app. So there are 3 levels of security: one you have to know where is that USB, then to know the pwd to access it, then the pwd to open the pwd manager. This USB have another 2 copies stored in different locations. This USB keeps also all backups of all my wallets. So no matter I lose my phone or my desktop is crashed totally I still can recover all my wallets anytime. When I travel I have one USB with me, always.  
Scams are everywhere man, open your eyes and do not fall into their hypes. One in particular: the so called "bitcoin debit cards" is the biggest scam ever. Now are popping up everywhere companies that will offer you a plastic card that they said is loaded with BTC and you spend fiat. That is total BS. Those cards are simple fiat cards, linked to a bank account linked to your person. So they took your BTC and give you the shit fiat, that they can create it endlessly with no any proof. So stay away from those. In the past I used a Xapo card but now just stays in a drawer, few times used and forgotten. It's a lie! Fiat it's a lie.  
So good luck man! May The Coin Be With You!

**There is NO TRUSTED USER** in Bitcoin world. Only Bitcoin makes the transaction trusted. Because is not reversible, no chargeback.  
Use a P2P decentralized exchange like bitsquare.io if you want some tools (escrow) that gives you a bit more "trust" in the transaction.

There are many services that pays fiat bills using your bitcoins, like cashila.
@_date: 2016-05-08 21:16:30
I prefer to pay to those services some fees than banks. There is no such a thing of a bank that do not charge you to move your money. Only they will do it hidden in other "services".  
Every day I get more and more to pay directly with my BTC wallet, I'm paid in BTC to my wallet so I have limited fees to pay that I can ignore them.
@_date: 2016-07-02 13:36:47
Yeah there are highly important for the operators (banks and visa) not  for Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin can work perfectly well WITHOUT those cards.  
So what you are doing posting them like a "solution to use BTC" is in fact a free promotion of banksters tool. You just make their game.  
This is like the plastic bags from a supermarket: they force you to pay for them, but they print their logo and promotions on those plastic bags. WTF, I am paying for their promoting material!  
So you are promoting their plastic cards to be like "helping" Bitcoin ecosystem but in fact is hurting the ecosystem, because those plastic cards ARE NOT USING BTC, but fiat.

Try also  they have for many countries and accept BTC.  
If you are not in US (US didn't reached that "technology advantage level"), you can always use one of those services that pays bills in fiat and you give them BTC. You just have to choose to pay for the tickets with bank transfer.  
 - Canada  
 - EU

try also expedia.com or destinia.com both accept BTC and I think they have plan ticket services.

Personally I am a bit afraid of BTC mixers. Anything can happen and ruin the whole transaction.  
I will tell you my personal case of mixing. I would not say that is the best or that I recommend, take it just as a real example.  
I am paid in BTC for my work, so I am a bit "exposed" when I receive my BTC monthly payment to one BTC address. Yes in the past I used services like Bitwage or Cashila to receive my payments and then FW to my wallet. But now I am at another level, receiving to my wallet, one dedicated to this only.  
So, after I receive let's say 4-5 BTC in 1 tx, I make 1-5-6-7 other txs to shapeshift.io exchanging in any reasonable altcoin (also can offer some small profit sometimes). Then I create 3-4 new BTC addresses (sometimes to other different wallets and types of wallets) and I exchange back from that altcoin into BTC to many addresses. In this way I spread my income to many different wallets (mobile or desktop, trezors) for many different spends.  
I used this method for about a year (I live on BTC for more than a year) and works fine for me. Never lose any satoshi, I even had some profits from shapeshifts.

Everybody wants OB to be from the first day the new ebay but nobody wants to use it and improve it. It's open source so you are invited to contribute if you want.    
OB have not even 1 year from his launch day and people start complaining about the interface, number of shops and users. But nobody ask how they can contribute to this open source project.  
Be happy that you have this today! A total open source P2P decentralized marketplace is something that humanity never imagine would be possible.

Remember this: all wallets if in time accumulate many txs in history, will get to be not well responsive.  
I suggest to "clear" your mobile wallets periodically. Clearing means, move your coins to a new created wallet and new created BTC addresses.  
I do "clearing" combined also with a "shapeshifting" using shapeshift.io. Exchange BTC to any other altcoin and back to BTC in those new created wallets/BTC addresses. That give me more "anonymity" and clear wallets. But never use same amounts for IN/OUT. Let's say you have 3 BTC in 1 address/wallet, create a wallet with 3 new BTC addresses. You send 3BTC to altcoins but move them back in 3 different txs each 1 BTC to each BTC address.  
But this is just my personal way to do it, is up to you if you really want it.

Others in EU (that I know):  
bitcoin.de - P2P but not decentralized, works very well.  
anycoin.eu  
kraken.com  
cex.io  
bit2me.com - withdraw cash from ATMs  
bitboat.net - works nice but they have 9% markup  
chichap.com - works nice their mobile app with plastic cards  
cashila.com - pay bills also  
bitwa.la - pay bills also  
multisigna.com  
wallofcoins.com  
bitnovo.com  
coinffeine.com - P2P but not sure if is ready yet.  
The list goes on and on...

I don't mind to be the "ranting abrasive guy", I can handle all the negative rain against me, but at least other people will have another point of thinking, before falling into these kind of traps.  
Somebody have to sacrifice himself to tell the truth with loud voice and take in the face the rotten salads and tomatoes :)

Not all, and you don't have to use a Coinbase wallet to pay to another Coinbase wallet. That's stupid saying that all the transactions are done through Coinbase. Where I live nobody uses Coinbase and are quite a lot merchants now, they just present their own QR code from their wallet and done. No other BS intermediary. When I pay I pay with my wallet not a BS CB wallet. Fuck that shit. That's why was invented Bitcoin to get rid of all those bloodsuckers, intermediaries, we have now real P2P money. I don't a bank, I don't need a payment processor, I don't need an intermediary.   
BTW sounds really fucked that "payment processor" for a Bitcoin transaction. WTF is that? My own wallet is the payment processor.  
People should stop thinking and treat Bitcoin like any other fiat currency shit. **Bitcoin is truly P2P money!**
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:46:13

bitcoinway.com has a very good plugin for wp+woocmmerce sites. Works directly to your Electrum wallet, no fees, no intermediaries, no blockchain to download, you are always in control of your btc.

So you keep your BTC in a wallet related to what news says today?  
So tomorrow if you see other news you will move your coins to another wallet ?  
When is about to choose a wallet you never choose it because reddit, news, market, forums says that or that. You choose a wallet for only one thing first:  
  
Then come the other features, depending on what is the main use of that wallet/s.  
3rd level is the one dedicated to amounts of keeping: small, medium, large.  
Small - quick spends, mobile in general  
Medium - desktop, occasionally spends with medium/large amounts  
Large - hardware, paper wallets, for HODL, like your personal vault.

Nope. I think we will stay with BTC like it is today, store of value for few years more, until is well established and recognized as the best currency, like a digital gold.  
Then countries will start issuing his own coin based on a certain amount of BTC (backed by BTC). But not only countries will issue those coins, also will see regions, communities, companies etc.

Bitcoin is borderless so you don't need a specific country to live to be able to use Bitcoin. And also nobody can stop you to live in Pacific island and make BTC transactions to another country.

You see? My whole post history about Coinbase is confirmed now. As I always raise the warning to be careful with Coinbase because they are tracking your money use and they are a banksters tool, like VISA/Paypal.  
Many here told me that I am crazy/troll/extremist/lunatic etc but as always said: the truth must me spoken and the truth is only one.  
Many will say that ah it's ok, I just use them to buy and withdraw to my wallet. But even that is not enough.  
As I said million times here, Coinbase was created/funded by banksters with the **purpose to track those people that are buying/selling BTC**.
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:03:58
Oh not again this BS news!  
Selling "bitcoin certificates" means selling land from the moon, means selling dust.  
Just a word...   
Means, those banks are selling land on the moon... worthless papers like paper gold and fiat IOUs...  
Bitcoin means **PROPERTY**, anything else is credit or worthless IOUs.  
You see? This is the BEAUTY of Bitcoin, banksters and speculators can never fool people anymore... Is not your property, is not your bitcoins. Simple and never trust the other party will make safer your money.  
Nice try "penetrating the market", bankster. But now we have Bitcoin and you can't fool us anymore.  
You should delete this post and tell to your masters that also this time didn't work... **Bitcoin is non-penetrable**!  
Do not let them fool you with their "investing" scams!

**Everything is for a reason**.  
Put together these two and you have **Banksters^2**:  
  
and  
  
Are just 2 pieces of the whole puzzle: banksters tool created/funded to NOT helping/serving bitcoiners, but to slow down the adoption of Bitcoin by deceiving and making new comers to hate BTC (because of their services), until banksters will come up with their shitcoin and presented like the only viable solution. Coinbase is just preparing the "terrain", catching users and accumulate information about those who will use bitcoin or other crypto.  
In this case is not about a Bitcoin company that is looking for funding, but banksters looking for a tool to control the bitcoin users.  
You will see soon that I am right...  
BTC is P2P money, why not use also a P2P exchange?  
**BITSQUARE.IO - a P2P decentralized exchange**  
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:37:11
Many people buy small amounts of BTC, so that limit is insignificant barrier. I consider a huge mess the fact that people give up their financial privacy using Coinbase then considering a mess the fact that bitsquare is protecting them with that limit.

Noo, every satoshi counts!  
Here is a way to export your private keys from that wallet.dat file and then import them into an electrum wallet  
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:08:51
and what is the "from" address? OK that server looks legit (in mxtoolbox.com you can see which are the authorized servers for sending from a domain), but you didn't said that comes from support  
As far I can see their email domain is not well configured.  
Pref	Hostname	IP Address	TTL  
10 smf.inline.email.fireeyecloud.com 209.135.212.132  
20 iad.inline.email.fireeyecloud.com 209.135.212.132  
So mail1.bitstamp.net is not in the authoritative list... questionable that email. Maybe that server was hacked and used to send spams.  
I see that corresponds to an amazon server in Germany datacenter with IP 52.28.49.179. So seems that is their server but their admin didn't added into MX and SPF records, where are just those 2 indicated servers with the same IP. I see also that the SPF records are: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:amazonses.com ip4:54.235.132.61 ip4:52.28.49.179 -all, that corresponds to their mail1 server IP but is not specified correctly like mail1.bitstamp.net.

Guys, you still do not understand that **everything is for a reason** ? All the media disguised campaigns, shill posts, hyped announcements, fake hysteria it is created **to make people to use those services**.  
When a service is working fine and people are happy, nobody bother to put some money in a marketing campaign, is useless, the people will use it anyway.  
When a service is in trouble, companies usually push some money into marketing techniques to make people **think** that their services are great and they should use them.  
This is happening with all services and products not just Uber and Xapo. So next time when you see an article, post or news on TV, press, think twice: why now, why this, who is making profit from this, do I really need it?

Every move/payment you do is "shared" with "others".
@_date: 2016-07-05 22:12:35
No, good to ask, but did you read their FAQs?  
P2P in general is not "fully" anonymous. At some point in the trade you will have to give some information to the other part.  
For example: you buy BTC, so you are the one that is making the bank transfer to the other part. So in that moment the person who receive your fiat money, will see your bank account in the bank transaction. So that part is not anonymous anymore. But in some way, the bank can't control too much of this tx, they don't know exactly that you bought BTC or shoes...

So all the hassle was because of Coinbase shit wallet system not because Bitcoin payments doesn't work.  
I live on BTC for more than a year so for me paying with my BTC wallet (never Coinbase) is at daily basis. And never glitched, stuck, paid twice or something like this. I pay bills using Mycelium+Cashila and never had problems all goes smooth.

Stop promoting that [banksters tool - Coinbase](  
Are not enough users that get robbed/seized/fooled by those banksters?  
Coinbase was created/funded by banksters just to slow down and make hard the mass adoption of Bitcoin. All these "small problems" are well designed and programmed to make users to hate Bitcoin... They also want to track all those who buy/sell BTC, for later use. You are just a piece of their game when you use Coinbase.  
[Perfect example]( of masochistic way to try to buy BTC with Coinbase, instead of just using **a P2P exchange like bitsquare.io**, when you are always in control of your money and never nobody will ask you for your IDs, stole your funds and seize your accounts.    
The future is Bitcoin and all things P2P, not fiat and centralized exchanges, tracked by your govs...

**There is NO such thing of "bitcoin debit cards"!**  
Those cards are fiat cards, linked to a bank account, linked to your name, linked to all your shopping, linked to all your movements...  
Those cards are created EXACTLY to slow down the full adoption of Bitcoin and keep you chained to their fiat and bank accounts.  
Do not fall into this trap of banksters!  
A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them. The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Going back to plastic cards use, is going back to slavery masters...  
Downvoting this opinion means you are supporting VISA and the banksters! Or at least say why you downvoted it.

I wasn't quote that about stealing. My intention was to point that if you do not use your own wallet, you lose control of your money for any kind of reason. Maybe Xapo in that moment had some issues with their servers, so no big deal, is temporary, but if the user depends on only that wallet is bad. Users should realize that depending only of a web/3rd party wallet is a bad practice.  
And Andreas is right because the questions is simple: you put your coins into a 3rd party wallet, you lost control of those coins. If they will give you the option to export/import private keys to another wallet, so when they have issues with their wallet you can still use those coins from another one, that will be great. But they don't. So those coins are cease to be your coins once you put them in a web/3rd party wallet.

What have to do a torrent site with HSI?  
This is another HOAX planned by CIA. All those "proves" are too obvious for a dumb person that run a torrent site at this level.  
I really do not believe that an ukrainian guy will leave so obvious and stupid traces: FB login, itunes (WTF you buy songs to put them on torrents?) and Coinbase logins from the same IP. We are living in a world full of VPNs, TORs and other protection and shit and still an admin of a torrent site is doing these huge mistakes.

No, he goes to a bank and says, hey can you give me a paper where it says that I can spend 70 millions of that shit, so I can give it to these guys, so they think I gave them those money?    
Ah, if he goes with an armored truck and dump a bunch of bags of fiat cash, maybe, maybe we can consider a funding. But what he did was just giving a worthless IOU paper, fake money that doesn't exist.

Try to make a loan from a bank and ask them to give you those money in cash. They will never give you cash, just IOUs papers. Why? Because they do not have those money to lend, just a promise. So the loan is fake from the beginning.  
Then try the same with Bitcoin. The lender cannot give you the loan if he doesn't own those BTC.

 a P2P decentralized exchange  
 - mobile app (Spanish company) that offer easy buy with plastic cards.  
You can pay your bills with your Mycelium+Cashila directly from your BTC. Create an account on cashila.com, link it with your Mycelium wallet, go to SEPA transfers, put the invoice details and pay. Easy as cake.

I will tell you just one aspect:  
If I have to use an exchange like Coinbase I have to give up all my details: full name, email, IDs copies, KYC/AML BS stuff, what am I buy, what am I sell, bank details, cards details, anything that a gov would like to know about me and control me.  
If I would use an exchange like bitsquare.io I never have to give up those details in the first place. The only thing you will share and that is ONLY with the other part of the tx, is your bank account from where you send fiat to buy BTC.  But that is insignificant in a gov tracking situation. I can have a dedicated bank account only for using to buy BTC.    
And this is not about buying drugs, guns etc, is about your liberties.  
A great quote here:  
**"Bitcoin doesn't require to reveal yourself. That is not a bug, it is a FEATURE!"**  
   
**Financial privacy is NOT a privilege, is a right** and Coinbase is violating that right every single time you use their services.  
So decide for yourself, I was just warning the OP about the risks.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:38:16

"Pain points"? Nope. I see many bitcoin users that are "struggling" to live on BTC but most of them are from the other side of the Atlantic. I live in EU, small community, but here all things are fine with BTC, every day more and more people are getting in. And maybe because here we are not so "pegged" to the banksters system with their policy of "all on credit cards"...  
Living on BTC is more about "changing your mentality" first and then looking where to pay with BTC, then talking with many people and convince them to use BTC, but one and the most important is **start being paid in BTC**.  
As far I can see, people from US&amp; Canada are just waiting from a divine decision that from now on everybody will accept BTC. No! Is not like that, adoption start from each one of us, the decisions we make, the actions we take... And the first decision/action is: **no more fiat use**

As I **always** say it loud here:  
I wonder when people will realize why and [who created Coinbase](  
Coinbase was created/funded by banksters just to slow down and make hard the mass adoption of Bitcoin. All these "small problems" are well designed and programmed to make users to hate Bitcoin... They also want to track all those who buy/sell BTC, for later use. You are just a piece of their game when you use Coinbase.  
[Perfect example]( of masochistic way to try to buy BTC with Coinbase, instead of just using **a P2P exchange like bitsquare.io**, when you are always in control of your money and never nobody will ask you for your IDs, stole your funds and seize your accounts.    
The future is Bitcoin and all things P2P, not fiat and centralized exchanges, tracked by your govs...
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:49:50
BTC is not tax avoidance, is securing your future.
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:38:26
This is a nice and powerful tool for bitcoiners.  
I can't give you a personal experience because I didn't use it personally. I am paid in BTC so no means for me to buy anymore BTC. I never sell BTC, just use/hodl them.  
I wished that this P2P exchange would be launched soon back in 2013-2014 (when I was buying), but is not too late for new comers now.  
With so many rules and regulations and new draconian KYC/AML that will be imposed on ALL normal BTC exchanges, this P2P exchange will be the best solution to get some bitcoins.  
What I can tell you is that a friend of mine use it few months ago, with success, all process go smooth and quick. My friend ios buying now at a regular basis BTC using this exchange.  
Let's remember this is a P2P exchange! Person to person with escrow system. But this exchange will never give away your data, will never close your account, will never seize your funds, will never ask you for KYC/AML.  
The future is Bitcoin and Bitcoin is P2P money. Soon everything will be P2P and this exchange is a good example. Is like OpenBazaar.  
For those who don't know there is also bitcoin.de, an older P2P BTC exchange, but that one have a central point and is asking for your ID. But the exchange is P2P. Aslo this one works perfect.

@_date: 2016-07-15 14:19:28
Yes, you put reasonable questions. Here is my answer:  
- buying BTC from an exchange - who is stopping you to use a P2P decentralized exchange like bitsquare.io, where you are always in control of your money, nobody will track you, ask you for KYC/AML, just the receiver will know from which bank account the fiat come. That is the lowest risk to be "revealed". You want to more hidden/anonymous? Nobody will stop you to use Mycelium local trade, in person, or localbitcoins trade.  
- when you make a payment online, nobody will ask you to present an photo ID before you make a BTC payment. You will need to provide and address for delivery. Even if you will input your name (if you are forced to give your real one), you can use anytime a throw away BTC address. Remember? BTC addresses in a wallet are not limited, you can create as many as you want.  
Look, I live on BTC for more than a year. I am paid in BTC, I spend in BTC, I HODL BTC. So to "anonymize" my incomes, because they pay me to a single address, I use shapeshift to exchange my 1 BTC address to 2-3-4 txs in altcoins. Then back to BTC to another new 5-6-7 created BTC addresses. So nobody can trace back to me (my real identity) the same coins i received and for what I spend them. There will be no prove to link to my real name.

Soon you will see that will be a pfffssssss...

Still people don't learn the lesson and fall into these lies and traps.  
**You really want to invest your bitcoins in something huge? Take one or some Bitcoin companies, startups and buy some shares in their company, help them to launch their product for Bitcoin. That is a real investment if you really care about Bitcoin.**

You use VISA, is fiat, you are not making any good to Bitcoin, but making big pockets of banksters and VISA.  
Each time you use fiat to pay, central banks will create from thin air those money. Then you pay bailouts, taxes etc to cover that process. It's a simple economy class that nobody wants to understand that we need to stop this process of lie. But instead we choose the "comfort" to pay with VISA and not the freedom of paying with Bitcoin.  
If those fiat will be backed by Bitcoin maybe there is a reason to pay with a VISA, but fiat is backed by nothing, are just IOUs, are not money.
@_date: 2016-07-25 17:27:19

@_date: 2016-07-22 15:39:28
You will see soon that I am right.  
People should fight for using their own BTC wallets and not let them be fooled by those cards, just because you now can use your BTC.  
Let's be clear:  
- your BTC CANNOT be spend if you do not have them  
- a visa card is full of non-existing money that they allowed you to spend them forever, later you will pay the consequences and your grandchildren too...    
**If we continue this lie, banksters will fool us forever to use their IOUs lies and we will be forever enslaved!**  
Just hiding behind the comfort of easiness of using those cards just because are accepted and BTC not doesn't mean you fight for your freedom, for your financial freedom, but you are going deeper and deeper in the shit that banskters are throwing at you.  
People should wake up, this is the last chance, with Bitcoin, to see the light from the other side of the tunnel. Using fiat in any form is just enslaving you more, using BTC (directly with your wallet) will free you. Each time you use BTC, wallet to wallet you put another boot on the face of a bankster.  
**Satoshi took the power of creating money from the banksters and give it to the people.** This is an incredible breakthrough of humanity. But some of you are still blinded by banksters easy tricks to no use that power, so you are going back to their enslaving tool.  
You complain that you don't have too many places to spend your BTC directly?! Make the damn (R)EVOLUTION and convince as many as you can merchants, companies to use BTC. Stop using plastic cards. Stop using bank accounts. Only like that we can win this fight.  
I live on BTC for more than a year, I close all my bank accounts. This is my fight against banksters! I do not use their instruments of slavery! Yes it wasn't so easy to be here, but I never complain, I look for online shopping with BTC , I convince as many as I can merchants (i did that a lot in my community), I convince my employer to pay me in BTC, I convince my landlord to accept my rent in BTC, I found a way to pay bills in BTC and never touch again a bank account plastic card or fiat cash. **What did you do in this matter?**  
Do not complain, act!

Helping a Bitcoin company is much better for your investment to grow in the future, because Bitcoin IS the future.  
Instead og having Bitcoin companies funded by banksters crooks  
**[Coinbase is funded by banksters crooks - No.1](  
**[Coinbase is funded by banksters crooks - No.2](  
We better create a P2P fund that will finance creation of great Bitcoin companies that we the people, control them.  
Check that CredibleFriends.com platform, is in beta now but have a great potential.  
We start with P2P money - Bitcoin  
Then we create P2P marketplace - OpenBazaar  
Then we create P2P exchange - Bitsquare.io  
Then we create P2P lending - CredibleFriends  
What can be next?  
A P2P funding for projects in common interest for all humanity?  
You asked about bitbonds. OK fine you can buy those types of bonds, but the question is what is a bond? Is actually an IOU like fiat but with more security and certifications etc . So in the end you give up your BTC for a piece of paper, promising you that in some day will pay a certain amount of money.  
But a direct investment in a Bitcoin company will bring you more satisfaction and money. BnKToTheFuture this is doing, creating a funding platform for Bitcoin companies, funded by normal people and investors.

What I do not see yet developed is this. And this will be a boom!  
An OpenBazaar for apartment rentals (like a P2P decentralized AirBnB), where:  
- owners can publish their own apartments, for normal rentals, tourist rentals or whatever rentals  
- all prepayments/payments done with Bitcoin, directly to the owner's wallet  
- for those apartments where owners installed new technology doors, that can be opened ONLY with the BTC address that was paying the booking. I know it is already developed this but I can't find right now the links.  
- additional cleaning services can be added to the bookings, by request or default.  
- the list of features is open...

Yes you are right gold failed to substitute fiat because 1000 years we didn't reached the digital age and because 1000 years the banksters manipulate and fool people to give them their gold in exchange for their worthless goat shit fiat.

No, better leave it so others can be warned. I didn't want to shoot you, the messenger, I know you always post many links just to inform people and that is fine. But I suggest more precaution from now on. Bitcoin became more and more attracted by scammers and those fuckers will never spare an opportunity to make some money from people that doesn't have time and knowledge to check things better.  
The link I posted at the end is a good reference to check scams. And the WHOIS, today is a must for financial websites. If there will be about dildos I would understand the need to "privacy" but not when is about people's money.

[Perfect example]( of masochistic way to try to buy BTC, instead of just using **a P2P exchange like bitsquare.io**, when you are always in control of your money and never nobody will ask you for your IDs, stole your funds and seize your accounts.  
I wonder when people will realize why and [who created Coinbase](  
Coinbase was created/funded by banksters just to slow down and make hard the mass adoption of Bitcoin. all these "small problems" are well designed and programmed to make users to hate Bitcoin... They also want to track all those who buy/sell BTC, for later use. You are just a piece of their game.

Not only that. Review the whole case, are lots of questions that people do not ask or want to be revealed.  
In my opinion and I know sounds crazy but just think a bit about "what if this is real?":   
Gov agents created SR from the beginning, inserted the idea into some people mind, infiltrate their agents from the beginning into SR "core", but not catch the "bad guys" selling drugs, but to create a good "case" to demolish the "trust" in Bitcoin.  
Ross was used like a patsy by gov agents, deceiving him, and I believe that many "proves" against him are fabricated.  
FBI/NSA/CIA have the resources, the will and determination to do a scenario like this. They are masters in disguise.  
I consider SR case almost the same important like JFK assassination. Have many implications and many theories that could be in place.  
EDIT: you will see that this theory is not welcomed to be told here, by the many downvotes I will get for this opinion. So that will give you an idea about the "strains" of this case.

I am glad that you are a "fighter" too!  
But believe me I was struggling doing the same from 2012. From 2015 (when I start being paid in BTC) I stopped doing that anymore. I decided that no worth anymore to wake up stupid people. [Banksters will do the rest of the job]( I am so sure about that.  
Now my "strategy" is at reverse: making fiat worth shit (is already), give it away, burn it in front of them, just to show them my "opinion" about a worthless goat shit. and on the other side, I make BTC desired: never give it away, sell it for 30-40% more market price if they want to take from me, if I give some satoshis for testing purpose I request them back or in exchange or something else (but not fiat), sometimes even being like Gholum with his precious ring :)  
In my opinion Bitcoin reached a level of awareness quite high, so from this point only those who really understand it will use it, hodl it. We are not talking about speculators, they will always dump it for quick profits, but those will be the ones that will lose everything in the end, because their greed will make them sell for piles of worthless goat shit that in the end NOBODY will use it anymore.

Work for bitcoins   
I see you tried ll kind of things (stupid things) but you never think that you can work and pe paid for your work in bitcoins.  
If you are too lazy to work, buy some using an exchange like bitsquare.io
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:06:03
But you forgot the P2P. Bitsquare.io and OpenBazaar is doing a great job out there.  
Bitcoin - P2P money  
Bitsquare - P2P exchange  
OpenBazaar - P2P marketplace  
Banksters can suck it from now.  
And if they still impose strictly rules over normal exchanges, people will start looking into being paid in BTC. We have already more than 75% of all BTC mined so enough to start building a new type of economy, not based on fiat, banks and tyrannical govs.

OK I appreciate your good intentions to create a site/exchange for "almost anonymous" exchange. But what is the point of just being intermediary between parts, that will exchange anyway emails between them.  
I can do the exchange in OpenBazaar or Bitsquare much better than this. Or even Mycelium trader is netter than this.  
If you really want to contribute with something for anonymity, why don't you make another P2P exchange and be the middle man/escrow or something like this. Even an improved copy of Bitsquare will be appreciated. The best will win!  
So this intent, smells like a fbi/nsa trap but the lack of design and idea makes me think that they are capable of more than this.

@_date: 2016-07-22 08:23:37
Let's be clear: You are **NOT** traveling with Bitcoin, you are using fiat cards. Again subversive titles to fool people to use their scam services.  
You have been warned!  
  
As I warned people here many times about Coinbase and many says I am crazy, yet my words are proven.  
As I warned people here about this scam Wirex, soon you will see that I am right.  
Wirex is the defunct E-coin scam and is run by banksters. The goal is to fool you to NOT use your BTC wallet but their stupid cards. And you already know what is doing a plastic card with your identity.  
**Everything is for a reason** is not to help you using Bitcoin.  
This Wirex company is doing the same like Coinbase: pushing by shills their services, using reddit like a promoting platform to fool people.  
**Wake up people! The Bitcoin Revolution will not be made with VISA cards, but with BTC wallets!** Make it possible that all merchants accept BTC and not plastic cards. Continuing to use plastic cards you just continue to bleed using fiat.  
Now, the banksters see that they can't stop Bitcoin but they think can hijack it by fooling people to use the so called "bitcoin debit cards", that in fact are just fiat cards, fiat that is controlled by them and have nothing to do with your bitcoins. There is a "war" started between banks who is taking more bitcoiners with these cards.  
Just think a bit: you have your bitcoins, you own those bitcoins, are yours. But they give you a card in exchange for your bitcoins (ownership), full of fiat worthless IOUs, money that doesn't exist! I think people do not realize this **HUGE SCAM**!  
Quick tip: why there is no big info about the director of e-coin/wirex Dmitry Lazarichev before Peltrade? This person is presented like the "financial specialist" but nothing before, to see his "experience" in scams. Seems to be a fabricated person by banksters, clean and nice presented. And this in real world is not happening or at least when they clean the traces.  
  
  
The truth is only one.  
"If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.  
We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth.  
The bamboozle has captured us.  
It’s simply too painful to acknowledge,even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.  
Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”

@_date: 2016-07-13 20:58:53
All are fiat cards, I mean worthless goat shit fiat.  
Bitcoin will never "back" a credit card and will never be a "debit card". You own bitcoins, you can't debit them. You do not own them you cannot spend them. Simple like that.  
A credit card = money created from nothing, money that you are paying later with taxes (forget about interest, that is nothing).  
**Bitcoin  = money that you cannot spend it if you do not own it**  
More than this:  
**There is NO such thing of "bitcoin debit cards"!**  
Those cards are fiat cards, linked to a bank account, linked to your name, linked to all your shopping, linked to all your movements...  
Those cards are created EXACTLY to slow down the full adoption of Bitcoin and keep you chained to their fiat and bank accounts.  
Do not fall into this trap of banksters!  
A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them. The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Going back to plastic cards use, is going back to slavery masters...  
Downvoting this opinion means you are supporting VISA and the banksters! Or at least say why you downvoted it.

 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards

Then one of the bars owner, because he accept from me BTC, he started to buy with BTC from the grocery...  
The whole thing started with me, being paid in BTC :)  
But depending on where you live, there are many online shops or just shops that start accepting BTC. For example this one:  or  and many others. Just look closer, ask them, discuss with them. Everything is possible but not just waiting for them.

Again this scam? And now promoted by bitcoin.com? 
Just look to the WHOIS info for ipayyou.io   
And remember: when you see a website that is putting on the front page a big picture of a vault and says "it's secure" ... that's exactly the opposite.  
Just looking to those "people" on the front page, all smiling like zombies, it gives you shivering on your back, like they are ready to grab your coins and run... Hey guys from ipayyou, smiling creepy people is not providing comfort for my money, just shows me how ready they are to scam me.  
Just read this from their "secure" section:  
**"iPayYou wallet keeps all funds in your personal bitcoin account – not in our wallet. You retain full control – there is even a way for you to spend it without needing to log into our site. Your private keys are encrypted on our server and are backed up, backed up again and then just for safe measure, backed up again. Security based on 2048 bit certificates – no one can decipher the keys, even our employees."** - Do you believe this shit?!!!  
So, if the bitcoin wallet keys are mine, why should I keep them into their hands (even if the backed up and backed up), why should I pay fees to them when I can use my own BTC wallet ?  
You have been warned! You really want to put your money into hands of somebody that is not providing info about who really is?  
And normally when you see more than once per day a post about "promoting" a product/service, that is fishy like hell, suspicious to be paid shill.

Ha!   
Nothing from their actions shows us that their goal was to "grow bitcoin as fast and as broadly as possible" but at reverse:  
- tracking users  
- imposing strictly rules  
- making impossible to trade  
- closing accounts  
- pushing hard the so called "bitcoin debit cards" that in fact are **fiat VISA cards**, so nothing to do with "grow bitcoin as fast and as broadly as possible"

You see? This is the big problem. People start to believe that is their business MY MONEY. Their service is to offer me a deposit account and nothing else.  
If you will go to a bank to open account and from the beginning they would say:  
- we will watch all your movements, sources  
- ask you every time you use this account what you gonna do with these money  
- will limit your withdrawals  
- will limit your transactions  
- will force you do NOT use cash  
- will seize your account if we don't agree with that  
- we will give the "keys" of your account to your gov to seize your money  
**YOU WILL NEVER OPEN THAT ACCOUNT!**

"paper wallets": 1 copy in paper, stored in a metal case, well hidden (not in my house) and 2-3 digital copies stored in encrypted USBs (with other wallets also) also well hidden not in my house.  
Another way that I like it is to put the 12 words hidden in a normal sentence and that sentence, stored in a normal text, that only you wil know it. In plain sight, or in a picture, like a poster on your hall or in garage.  
I also have 1 wallet stored ONLY in my brain: 12 words trained to remember. With some practice it's quite easy.  
**But I will never keep all my BTC in 1 wallet, whatever that will be**. That is a good practice also against wifes, they usually spend all that they find... So give them only a spending wallet and the rest keep it safe :) **Wifes are worst than a broken trezor** :)

I closed all my bank accounts and burn the plastic cards more than a year ago...  
When I went to the bank to do that, they asked me why I close all the accounts and I said: I have my own bank now... then I show them my BTC mobile wallet and the tshirt with Be Your Own Bank. Then just throw the burned plastic cards on the table... and leave forever that bank office.

In general many of new cryptos are a pump/dump ponzi scheme. There are many "great investors" out there, that are launching these kind of phrases just to pump and then dump the crypto.  so they can get out with a lot of money, because fools believe them and buy that shitcoin.  
Today there are very few coins that still can be considered "trusted" in some way. But only one will stay and that is Bitcoin.

From the tons of other exchanges, still you end up in the pit of crocodiles (Coinbase)...  
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU

I pay 90% in BTC directly so more than miner fees what else? If you refer to cashila, bitwage etc, are infinite less than keeping a bank account/plastic card etc. Even if will be equal with fiat fees, I would prefer to pay them than to fucking banksters.  
I closed all my bank accounts, FUCK THE BANKS! They sucked enough blood from us, is time for them to go...
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:01:24
I have used bitcoin.de (that is also a P2P exchange) several times (when I was buying BTC, now I earn them) and NEVER have a problem like that. Same with bitsquare.  
A bank transfer is NOT so easy, as you think, to reverse it. So scammers know that and not use it.  
And let's be CLEAR: KYC/AML ARE NOT to protect YOU from scammers, but to track you down. They say that is to protect you but in fact is to fool you with that reason, to fall into their trap.
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:29:06

BS, fiat will be obsolete soon and will be no need to build a fiat currency over BTC.  
But... what we can have is this: many other cryptos, colred coins, backed by BTC. Is already possible to create a crypto and define how many BTC is backing a certain amount of those coins.  
In this way we can have many other local currencies and we will never have the problem of today: central banks creating money from thin air.

You miss the whole point of using fiat.  
An example: you sell 1BTC to those issuers of those plastic cards. In that moment they will not have the fiat money to pay/debit you for your bitcoins. They borrow them from a bank, That bank also doesn't have them, physically, they borrow them from a central bank that is just printing more fake money as much the market wants...  
This whole process will never work infinitely, forever. Because it's a lie!  
If you want to print money because you don't have enough to buy a bike, you get to jail. A bankster get a bailout or more money, but never get to jail and you are the one that pays his debt. Is this fair for you?  
Those plastic fiat debit cards (don't name them "Bitcoin Debit cards" because is fake) are filled with IOUs not with money like bitcoins.  
If you want to live in a world where LIE is TRUTH, then use the fucking fiat.  
If you want to live in a free world where TRUTH is TRUTH, use Bitcoin.   
Nobody can give you 1BTC if he doesn't have it!  
Please go to any bank and borrow 1 million fiat and ask to give that credit in cash, right away. Nope nobody will give you those bills. Because they don't have them. They just lend fake virtual money.

Go to a MeetUp Bitcoin near you. Start your own MeetUp group. Teach yourself, teach others and that will make you a bitcoin savvy. You will never regret that.  
I did that and in few years my local community has many bitcoiners now. And for more than a year I live only with BTC, closed all my bank accounts.
@_date: 2016-07-29 08:04:16
I live on BTC, I am paid in BTC, I spend in BTC from my wallets and I HODL some (that I mine in the early years).  
I pay the rent in BTC to the landlord directly to his wallet.  
I pay some groceries to the local shop, run by a paki that also send/share those BTC with his family in Pakistan.  
I have also some local bars that accept BTC (when they saw my move with the grocery they start also).  
Other needs buy online (spendabit.co is a good start).  
Also bills are paid through Mycelium wallet linked to a cashila.com account.  
Every day is better and better for me.  
Is not easy, but a person that want to live like that needs a lot of determination to do that. I have one, big: I HATE BANKSTERS. They ruined my life and others and I said enough is enough, from now on I will never use their worthless goat shit fiat!

You will regret that decision to use Coinbase. Soon.  
  
Or soon you will be victim like many of these:  
  
I will NOT recommend you any wallet in particular, but I would say this:  
**there is no best wallet, but safe wallet**  
Use any of the wallets that **you control all the time 100% your private keys**  
You better install and test all of them and see which one is most suitable for your needs.  
Desktop: electrum, multibit  
Mobile: BTC wallet Schildach (one of the 1st launched wallets), Mycelium, Airbitz, Electrum (you can use same wallet files from desktop version), BCI  
Hardware: Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey and many others.
Online/WEB: I would never recommend any of them. There is a matter of time when their servers get hacked or your account get keylogged.  
Exchanges: definitely I would never "recommend" Coinbase. Is the worst case scenario. Try to use most of the time P2P decentralized exchanges like bitsquare.io and you will never get hacked, scammed, robbed, seized, account closed, tracked, stupid KYC/AML.  
Please save my words for later. You will remember them...
@_date: 2016-07-21 20:40:36

I was warning and warning about Coinbase, but everybody laugh at me. I don't need your gratitude now. I just want you guys to learn this lesson: that not everything is "promoted" here is good. Do not fall into this trap of shills and be cautious and act accordingly, read more, think, analyze.

Don't need to be a "WW success". Bitcoin just open the "pandora's box" of P2P, decentralization, encryption etc.  
Is a matter of time until we will have a multitude of "Bitcoin like" solutions that some even will interact between each other, complementary.  
We already have (in just 8 years!!!):  
- P2P money - Bitcoin  
- P2P marketplace - OpenBazaar  
- P2P exchange (not only for FIAT but also many other altcoins) - Bitsquare.io and shapeshift.io  
What's next? P2P gov, P2P everything!
My vision/prediction/opinion (you name it) will be like this:  
Bitcoin will be the digital gold, storing value for long time.  
Many other altcoins/colored coins will be created and used at a daily basis, national coins, regional coins, companies coins, govs coins etc  
But all of them to have a real value will be backed by a certain amount of BTC. So when you create one of those you will need to have prove that you own that amount of BTC. Who wants to buy some of those coins will pay with BTC only.  
Bitcoin, even if we find a way of this endless debate of block scaling, will not be a one world currency for daily basis. Humanity didn't reached that level of intelligence that will make this happen. When all wars, greed and territorial disputes will be over maybe humans will pass to the next level. Until then we are just advanced monkeys with guns.

Again this scam? And now promoted by bitcoin.com? 
Just look to the WHOIS info for ipayyou.io   
And remember: when you see a website that is putting on the front page a big picture of a vault and says "it's secure" ... that's exactly the opposite.  
Just looking to those "people" on the front page, all smiling like zombies, it gives you shivering on your back, like they are ready to grab your coins and run... Hey guys from ipayyou, smiling creepy people is not providing comfort for my money, just shows me how ready they are to scam me.  
Just read this from their "secure" section:  
**"iPayYou wallet keeps all funds in your personal bitcoin account – not in our wallet. You retain full control – there is even a way for you to spend it without needing to log into our site. Your private keys are encrypted on our server and are backed up, backed up again and then just for safe measure, backed up again. Security based on 2048 bit certificates – no one can decipher the keys, even our employees."** - Do you believe this shit?!!!  
So, if the bitcoin wallet keys are mine, why should I keep them into their hands (even if the backed up and backed up), why should I pay fees to them when I can use my own BTC wallet ?  
You have been warned! You really want to put your money into hands of somebody that is not providing info about who really is?  
And normally when you see more than once per day a post about "promoting" a product/service, that is fishy like hell, suspicious to be paid shill.

Are just 2 pieces of the whole puzzle: banksters tool created/funded to NOT helping/serving bitcoiners, but to slow down the adoption of Bitcoin by deceiving and making new comers to hate BTC (because of their services), until banksters will come up with their shitcoin and presented like the only viable solution. Coinbase is just preparing the "terrain", catching users and accumulate information about those who will use bitcoin or other crypto.  
In this case is not about a Bitcoin company that is looking for funding, but banksters looking for a tool to control the bitcoin users.  
You will see soon that I am right...  
BTC is P2P money, why not use also a P2P exchange?  
**BITSQUARE.IO - a P2P decentralized exchange**

Insolvency? That is the last thing you should be worry. The worst thing about them is that are banksters crooks and traitors.  
**[Coinbase is funded by banksters crooks - No.1](  
**[Coinbase is funded by banksters crooks - No.2](  
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU

Bitcoin doesn't need "investment" funds, hodl, bitcoin certificates, bitcoin debit cards and shit like that.  
Bitcoin need to be used, adoption, apps that make easy use for merchants and customers and most important to have people well informed, people that are paid in bitcoins, people that use bitcoin daily.  
Then will come the lending platforms, trust funds, scam funds, ETF, ETI and other BS lies.  
"Investing" in Bitcoin ETF means **greed and foolishness**, that means we will never get out of this deep shit even if Bitcoin try hard to get us out from this shit.

Let's be clear: Bitcoin and other cryptos are NOT "virtual currencies". You can say digital currencies but NOT "virtual".  
But you can say about fiat currencies that are "virtual" because those money doesn't exist, are created from thin air, not even digital doesn't have any prove how was created.  
So let's stop using this BS term about Bitcoin being "virtual currency". IS digital yes.

When you say "mob rule" people think of a bunch of crazy fucks that make their "rules of force". Is not like that. P2P gov means looks more like  how is in Switzerland the political system, focused more on direct democracy.  
A P2P government will be quite easy to manage with a blockchain, people can vote/propose/act directly on any social issue that is in their interest to participate. Ok we can use politicians like "promoters" of projects or laws or whatever needs to be decided, but the final vote will be from the each citizen.  
So when is about to spend billions on wars, bombs, war machines etc, and a promoter come up with the invoice to be paid for all those expenses, people will think twice if they will vote or not that invoice, instead of building an university or a hospital...  
I think you understand what I wanted to say with this.
@_date: 2016-07-15 09:32:41
Oh yeah, instead on focusing on how to convince merchants and people to use Bitcoin, now we focus on how to convince people to not use Bitcoin wallets, but "virtual" VISA cards!  
So we are going back to master - slave relation, instead of freedom...  
All these so called "bitcoin debit cards" are in fact a tool against Bitcoin adoption, is slowing down the adoption, is tracking all your movements (so the gov can come up after you later) and is still keeping alive the fucking banksters (by the fees you pay using their worthless goat shit fiat)!  
What a madhouse world... Wake up people, you are being fooled!  
A bit of history for those who are new here:  
- Wirex is the deceased E-coin. Like many other scams they always re-brand it into a new born app, coin or whatever  
- Run by a russian director [Dmitry Lazarichev](  
- [Suspicious to be a scam](  
EDIT: yeah downvote this because you are a brainwashed slave that doesn't understand one thing: Bitcoin = Freedom, Fiat/VISA = slavery!  
**Satoshi did something amazing for the humanity: he took the power of creating money from the banksters and gave it to the people, to trade freely P2P. But the humans (or monkeys better said) turn down that gift and start giving up their bitcoins (freedom money) for fiat money (slavery money), loading those plastic cards. Shame on you humans! The banksters are freaking happy now, when you go back to their fiat...**

If you have a website based on WP (Wordpress) with Woocommerce, there is a smooth plugin  that connects your Electrum wallet with your shopping platform. All BTC goes directly to your BTC wallet, no intermediaries, no fees, no conversion to fiat.  
If you want tips, just create a new dedicated BTC addres from your wallet and paste it on your web and if you like post the QR code.  
Once in a while, if you receive many tips, I suggest to use shapeshift.io to 2shapeshift" them into another altcoin and back to BTC, using a new BTC address to receive them back. In this way you "anonymize" a bit your tips. :)

If Coinbase would put from the beginning a big popup when users enter on their site, warning them that due to regulations imposed by gov, they have to report any movement of their users, that will be a fair notice and everybody will use it by their own risk and knowledge. But as I read here, many users not even read the TOS!  
But nooo, Coinbase didn't do that, even worse, did everything to catch as many is possible users, squeeze them for information, give away that information to who knows else, and didn't notice at all the users. And now you come to say that we have forget that and look to the real bad guy - gov.... No is not working like that. **Yes, the gov regulations are the CAUSE, but Coinbase, to be a fair "bitcoiner" like is posing, should inform their users about the risks**.   
Let's not forget who really is Coinbase:  
**[Coinbase is funded by banksters crooks - No.1](  
**[Coinbase is funded by banksters crooks - No.2](  
We don't need to complain anymore, we don't need regulations anymore.

We have P2P money - Bitcoin  
We have P2P exchange - Bitsquare  
We have P2P marketplace - OpenBazaar  
We have P2P lending - CredibleFriends  
We will have many more P2P services, one by one all will be P2P! We can do our life P2P (like should be), we have the tools, we just need the will of people move on. Enjoy it!

Stop putting this BS into weak minds... **Now you want that govs can use my bitcoins to bailout banks! NO WAY! They can do it with their worthless fiat goat shit, but not with MY BITCOINS!***  
Bitcoin and taxes are 2 things that will never meet, cross, work together or "collaborate!!  
Bitcoin can be "taxed" only if the owner want to give some. This is the beauty of Bitcoin. Nobody can take your bitcoins. Taxation in actual form is theft!  
I "foresee" that in a "Bitcoin economy" taxation will became just "voluntary funding" or "community funding".  
So politicians and corrupted govs.... bye bye! Because what we are paying today with our taxes, are just their fat asses, wars, military complexes, big phrama "studies" and "vaccines", GMOs, death and corruption.

Is quite confusing your request for help:  
- your store is online or brick&amp;mortar ? Or both?  
- Why should charge a 10% fee? To accept BTC cost you nothing, zero.  
For online store, if you have a web built on WP + Woocommerce, I suggest to use the plugin for BTC payments from [BitcoinWay]( Works great directly to your Electrum wallet. No fees, no intermediaries.  
For offline, you just open any wallet (Airbitz, Mycelium, BCI, Schildbach, Electrum) on a tablet/phone and present to the client your QR code for the payment.  
Like a marketing strategy, if you really want that your clients to go to BTC, I suggest to raise a 10-15% for fiat/visa payments (where you pay fees and commissions) and for BTC payments, keep the normal prices or give a 5% discount.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:21:37
That's why convinced many people around me or that I am dealing with, to use BTC. Easy for everybody.  
I convinced my landlord to accept BTC, just explaining him how many days will take to make a bank transfer for him, if I have to exchange BTC into fiat and then move them through a bank, fees etc. Next month to pay was in BTC directly to his newly created wallet. Now he pays some of his cleaning employees with BTC too (he have many apartments in the area).

Look I will explain my situation, that maybe will not fit yours and is not really necessary to do what I do. So take it like an example not like recommendation to do like that.  
I live on BTC, I am paid in BTC, I spend in BTC, I HODL some.  
So in this situation I have a problem: every month I receive all my income in 1 BTC address. That is not good. So I will need for this a wallet with many addresses to control for shapeshifting (exchange in altcoins and back to BTC to other new created addresses). For this I use Electrum desktop version. It's easy and fast to control and manage your addresses, labels, many to many tx etc. From Electrum I am distributing my incomes to many other wallets I have, a % to each.  
Electrum mobile - just a backup for the desktop version, to check.  
Multibit classic &amp; HD m- hodling some BTC from old mining days from 2012 until 2014.  
For "coffee payments" I use AirBitz, quick and safe + merchant directory.  
Mycelium - more online or on streets payments, bills (using cashila). This wallet is also imported in Electrum for better management.  
Schildbach Mobile wallet - backup wallet for Airbitz or Mycelium.  
BCI - a vanity address imported in that wallet that also stays on Electrum wallet. This I use it more for some donations, small incomes, something public (contain part of my name). These funds also are shapeshifted.  
Trezors - several Trezor hw wallets to keep in each 3-4 BTC, spreading the stash, never together, hidden.  
I do not use any online/web wallet, not even BCI, I do not trust them and also the browsers can be easily flawed.  
So for me none are the best/better than the others. All are good for what am I using each.

Financial privacy = nobody should know your financial transactions, accounts, spends, amounts, shopping habits etc.  
**The actual financial system doesn't work, is rotten!**  
The fact that you don't agree with those KYC/AML but you accept them and consider them a "fact of life" means you are just another sheeple that accept everything your gov it says, in other words another slave.  
Bitcoin come to help you to recover your freedom, but still you don't want that freedom.  
Buying from bitsquare means, your transactions are ONLY between you and the seller. So only you and you banks knows about that tx. Banks doesn't know you are buying x amount of BTC, is just a normal tx between 2 individuals. That's the point of bitsquare. **Is P2P**. Using Coinbase you have to give them all info: why you buy BTC, for what you spend, track your BTC wallet, put a star on your bank account etc.  
So far the majority of you using Coinbase will be victims of persecution, later, by your nazi gov.

Even that "purchase" is suspicious to be tracked and declared to your gov. That's why I strongly suggest to use a P2P exchange - bitsquare.io

Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:   
 - P2P exchange  
https;//bitsquare.io - P2P decentralized exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU

Yeah but that doesn't mean to go so excited that I have to pee in my pants because a guy throw some fake money into a startup. Those millions are shit anyway, you really think the guy sold his gold bullions to convert in fiat cash to fund that startup? No, he goes to a bank and says, hey can you give me a paper where it says that I can spend 70 millions of that shit, so I can give it to these guys, so they think I gave them those money?   
Ah, if he goes with an armored truck and dump a bunch of bags of fiat cash, maybe, maybe we can consider a funding. But what he did was just giving a worthless IOU paper, fake money that doesn't exist.  
So, do that with Bitcoin and then we talk about funding...

I convinced all my clients to pay me in BTC (I am freelancing). So all my income is in BTC. And from there all started.  
I pay my rent directly to the landlord. I convinced him to take my BTC.  
I pay my groceries to the local shop, run by a paki, that he uses those BTC to send them to his family in Pakistan. Now he have many others that pays in BTC in his shop.  
There are many other online shops where I buy stuff directly with BTC. Examples:

Why don't you create an OpenBazaar for your items? Also a simple WP+Woocommerce site with BTC payment plugin works nice. For 150 items definitely you need your own web.

From 2015 finally my dream come true: I start being paid in BTC for my work. Now I can spend BTC for my regular monthly spending and HODL what remains.

Why bother buying BTC, then send them back to a visa card? Stick from the beginning with the worthless goat shit fiat into a visa card.  
Let's be clear: these cards **are not helping** adoption of BTC. Adoption means when the merchant will take your BTC from your wallet to his wallet. People should focus on making this happening and not how to move back BTC to fiat, just because the merchant still doesn't know how to handle his BTC wallet or users are well "infected" with the "syndrome of fiat-visa" and the drug named Bitcoin is not so effective on their jelly brain.
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:26:17
Taxation in the actual form is a THEFT!  
Bitcoin will change that in a radical way. People should understand that Bitcoin will disrupt and change dramatically our society, for good! Who doesn't like/want to understand this is their problem, but those who will, are prepared (they use/hodl BTC).  
Stop bullshiting around on how to adapt Bitcoin to actual way of things. Bitcoin will never adapt, but will disrupt.  
I will tell you few things that will be changed (and please save this post for later):  
- Bitcoin will make fiat money OBSOLETE. Banks will not disappear all, some will adapt, some will be gone, like the fax machines. But banksters of today will have an obscure role - to crawl in shit.  
- Bitcoin will make actual taxation system - OBSOLETE. There will be voluntary funding (because is quite improper to say "voluntary taxation") for society projects. Projects that will be voted directly by people not by politicians and govs. People will decide what to do with their money. No more funding wars, military complex, GMOs and other crap.  
- Bitcoin will make politicians OBSOLETE. We don't need them to (not) "represent" us. We can represent ourselves using a blockchain technology. Making these scumbag obsolete, we solve from one shot a lot of things in this world. You name them, the list is huge.  
- Bitcoin will NOT be the one world currency. There will be many "colored coins" backed by a certain amount of BTC. So in order to "issue" a x amount of your let's say national coin, you will need to back them with a certain amount of BTC. Like a digital gold reserve.  
So stop being concerned about IRS taxes and govs, be concerned more about YOUR future. They can take care themselves (hang by their tongue). Or are you one of them and you are concerned about your nice job of fucking people?
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:31:10

Is not at all doing something illegal with your bitcoins, is about your financial privacy. Saying that you don't care about your financial privacy is saying that you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.  
**All those trackings by Coinbase are for a reason** and that reason is not only to catch bad guys selling drugs or gambling (like gambling is a bad thing), but to track everyone is using Bitcoin for later use by the gov.  
That's why you have to keep private your financial records at any cost. You will regret it later if not.  
BTW 99% of bitcoin users are not doing anything illegal with their coins.

BTW, I am not married, will never get married, but I live with the mother of my daughter, happily and prosper, each one with his money (BTC). Things are cleared from the beginning. If they want my money they should obtain them from me when I am alive. After that they get nothing.

Just looking to those "people" on the front page, all smiling like zombies, it gives you shivering on your back, like they are ready to grab your coins and run... Hey guys from ipayyou, smiling creepy people is not providing comfort for my money, just shows me how ready they are to scam me.  
Just read this from their "secure" section:  
**"iPayYou wallet keeps all funds in your personal bitcoin account – not in our wallet. You retain full control – there is even a way for you to spend it without needing to log into our site. Your private keys are encrypted on our server and are backed up, backed up again and then just for safe measure, backed up again. Security based on 2048 bit certificates – no one can decipher the keys, even our employees."** - Do you believe this shit?!!!  
So, if the bitcoin wallet keys are mine, why should I keep them into their hands (even if the backed up and backed up), why should I pay fees to them when I can use my own BTC wallet ?  
You have been warned! You really want to put your money into hands of somebody that is not providing info about who really is?

Pero sería mejor crear un r/BitcoinEspañol donde más gente puede encontrar información sobre Bitcoin en Español. Publicar en español aquí, es casi nada, muy pocos aquí entienden Español y además van a ignorar o downvoting tu post (hay muchos ignorantes).  
Yo, como hablo más idiomas (el Español) también, me preocupa que Bitcoin sea conocido por todo el mundo y me alegra y en el mismo tiempo me sorprende que no hay muchos españoles o hablante español que utiliza Bitcoin.

Ah no I don't think the world will gonna end, but just the banksters. I want to go off-grid because I like to "deal" with nature and be free. Right now I moved away from big cities, closer to the location where I want to go off grid. Just to "accommodate" and to know well the area, making the preparations, growing my own food.  
I hope Bitcoin will help me to buy the land and the rest...
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:45:14
Stop thinking of Bitcoin that is stocks, bonds, shares or other shit like that. Bitcoin is money. The rest is just worthless goat shit.  
Do not fall into the price market trap, to buy/sell for quick profits. Buy at steady pace, at whatever price it is with the money you can afford in that moment. Or just start working for bitcoins. Start using those bitcoins to buy stuff. Or just HODL them for later.  
I will tell you my "BTC experience".  
In 2012 I heard about Bitcoin, so I start reading. A lot. Then next month I start mining, with GPUs (at that time I had on my hands lots of computers that just stay doing nothing so I use them to mine when nobody use them). Then I start mining with USB miners, then start with online cloud mining contracts. This was like until 2014 when mining get really hard at that level.  
The BTC I earned from that early mining I still have them. Never sell. Those are for my daughter's future.  
So in 2014 until 2015 I didn't mine but I start buying, at any price, any volume, with 20-50-10-200€ anytime I had some extra cash available. And I HODL or just use them to buy stuff. From mid 2014 many places started to accept BTC around me.  
But in 2015 I start being paid in BTC for my work. I insisted to be paid and I convinced anybody around me to use BTC.  
So from 2015 I live on BTC. In March 2015 I closed all my bank accounts! Yes I close them. Fuck the banks!  
So now I earn BTC, I spend BTC, I HODL BTC. But never so focused on the market price. Is useless, because I know now for sue that fiat is almost obsolete. Doesn't make sense anymore to think that someday I will sell all my BTC for a pile of worthless goat shit fiat.  
I hope my story will help you to take the right decision for your future.

Ah an BTW, I never lose because I live on BTC. I am paid in BTC (that's why I shapeshift them) and I spend in BTC. But now that Bitpay is offering altcoin shopping (through shapeshift) I am thinking to keep some altcoins too, just for using them for shopping.

Suck my anonymity. Tell me what I just bought with BTC !  
I am just sick and tired of all these BS news propaganda titles. This proves exactly that the banksters are DESPERATE because Bitcoin get too much attention and adoption and they use the media to brainwash them the BTC is not anonymous anymore.  
I have news for you suckers! Bitcoin wasn't any time "anonymous" but pseudonymous.  
 I will tell you something else: I live on BTC for more than a year and my FIRST concern was to pseudoname my coins. I use shapeshift.io to shapeshift them so you can suck my anonymity finding exactly who have each BTC address and what is buying with that address.  
Ok you can close shapeshift.io but soon will popup like mushrooms many others. The Pandora's Box was already open!

Why not keep $2x7days then make them $14 and do the exchange once a week.  
But for god sake not on that shit Coinbase!  
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
And the list goes on and on...

I have like 2-3 vanity addresses. One for example I receive only my incomes (yes I work for bitcoins). But once I get the bitcoins I shapeshift them into altcoins and back to BTC to more than 3 new generated addresses (but never the original one). I don't have any problem reusing those vanity, that is the purpose for those addresses.  
There are many ways to keep your identity safe, not only not reusing a BTC address.

A bank of cryptos is a nonsense or a scam. Each crypto user is his own bank with his own wallet. Nothing to explain more.  
Those who think that a bank will secure your fund better than yourself are fooled or really stupid.  
Even if the bank will "attract" you with nice words like: vault, multisig, secure etc. always will be a chance to be hacked. Even if the hacking will not leave you with zero funds, will be enough that you can't access them.  
A hacker will always try to hack where are well known a large amount of funds not trying to hack obscure wallets that maybe are empty of few satoshis inside...

All are fiat cards, I mean worthless goat shit fiat.  
Bitcoin will never "back" a credit card.  
A credit card = money created from nothing, money that you are paying later with taxes (forget about interest, that is nothing).  
**Bitcoin  = money that you cannot spend it if you do not own it**  
More than this:  
**There is NO such thing of "bitcoin debit cards"!**  
Those cards are fiat cards, linked to a bank account, linked to your name, linked to all your shopping, linked to all your movements...  
Those cards are created EXACTLY to slow down the full adoption of Bitcoin and keep you chained to their fiat and bank accounts.  
Do not fall into this trap of banksters!  
A debit card is still a banksters tool... Think twice before use them. The future is Bitcoin not fiat! Using a plastic card, even if is funded with BTC, you just give more hope to VISA and MC and banksters to live few more days and make more money from you. Enough is enough, let's stop these bloodsucking vampires!  
Just an example:   
These cards are created/pushed by banksters with the goal to slow down the adoption of BTC, to make you NOT using your BTC wallet, to keep you chained to their obsolete banking system of fiat and plastic cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**   
- secure, nobody can stole your identity - check  
- nobody can know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you can) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards)**:   
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check  
Change your mentality to be "out of fiat". Only like that Bitcoin will thrive. If not, better not use it at all...  
Going back to plastic cards use, is going back to slavery masters...

Bitcoin and taxes are 2 things that will never meet, cross or "collaborate!!  
Bitcoin can be "taxed" only if the owner want to give some. This is the beauty of Bitcoin.  
I "foresee" that in a "Bitcoin economy" taxation will became just "voluntary funding" or "community funding".  
So politicians and corrupted govs.... bye bye! Because what we are paying today with our taxes, are just their fat asses, wars, military complexes, big phrama "studies" and "vaccines", GMOs, death and corruption.

Caution, also can be a disguised trolling from "another" company, or just trolling.  
Look, in the beginning, when Coinbase was launched, years ago, I was excited about. But soon I discovered that was funded by banksters ([BBVA]( that raised an alarm for me. Then problems started, another banksters fund them again, etc. So I start warning people here about Coinbase. Is not that I have something against this company, but their history/owners/practices are super shady.  
But also posting over and over "cases" of lost funds, closed accounts, after we all find out that they are bad company, will not help in any way. That shows 2 things: those people that continue posting, or are not well informed or are trolling for nothing, just to create more panic and division between BTC community.

That will not just absolve them for any anger (like mine) but will raise more questions against govs (like Bruce said) and people will start asking the right questions like this:

Why is so exciting this obscure, possible scam for Bitcoin?  
ETF - Exchange-trade fund - means you put your money in that fund and they trade with your money. In this case Bitcoin is an asset, but this will not help Bitcoin to go further. Just the owners of that fund to make more money with your funds and possible you get nothing in the end.  
Still people don't learn the lesson and fall into these lies and traps.  
You really want to invest your bitcoins in something huge? Take one or some Bitcoin companies, startups and buy some shares in their company, help them to launch their product for Bitcoin. That is a real investment if you really care about Bitcoin.

Is laughable this news but in the same time, means something.  
Western countries (leaded by US) wants to kick out Russia from SWIFT system (already almost dead). Is well known that. Because they have their stupid reasons. But Putin like a good diplomat and strategist, is preparing wisely his path to be independent of banksters system.  
First, he create good relations with BRICS and S.Asia countries.  
Then own banking system for trading and funding.  
Then will be a currency, based on a blockchain, because he realized that it's easier like that. Why do you think all the ping-pong of ban/un-ban Bitcoin and cryptos. He can't ban BTC and cryptos if he want to introduce his own crypto (controlled by state of course). That will put him in an awkward situation and Putin is not Obola...  
But yes, 2035 is a date quite far away of how fintech is evolving now...

Nope that was the easy part. The hardest party was to get paid in BTC.  
When I get all my income in BTC, my landlord also start accepting my rent in BTC. I have a grocery shop in my local community, run by a pakistani; after I explained him how it works he was really happy that he can take my BTC so he can send them to his family in Pakistan.  
I buy a lot also online. If a shop still don't accept BTC, I ask to make a SEPA transfer and I use cashila.com (send BTC from my mycelium wallet and they make the fiat payment).  
I never have to use a bank account anymore!

Coinbase is not a wallet. Is a bank that will steal your money. Is a matter of time when you will get closed your account, seized your money, tracked and who ever knows what they will do with that information you share with them using THEIR wallet.

Let's be clear: Ross wasn't the original "creator" of SR. CIA/NSA/FBI was the original ones and hidden pursue Ross and others to maintain it, like patsies.  
All proves we have about this case we see them from our lovely gov agencies, that they can fabricate them, manipulate them and used in their interest.  
They forced Ross to stay in jail and it's supposed that they threat his family with repercussions if he would say a word about the truth.  
The real goal of creation of SR by CIA/NSA/FBI was to discredit Bitcoin and his community. Their plan wasn't so good, the community is still in place, (but divided - another plan of theirs).
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:44:14

From gov agents. But that doesn't mean is the truth...

Debit cards: **remove the entire section - is nothing related with Bitcoin**, those are just fiat cards. You just create more confusion for the new comers. A bitcoin debit card is a nonsense, will never exist.  
You can replace this section with **payroll companies**: bitwage, cashila, bitwala  
and/or **bill payment processors**: cashila, bitwala, piixpay, bitbill, bitrefill and many others

The exchanges section is quite short and not concludent. I think you should make a split in 2: trusted and less trusted exchanges. And bitsquare.io to be a separate one, because IS THE ONLY ONE P2P! That is a very important thing and people should make the difference.

I wonder when people will realize why and [who created Coinbase](  
Coinbase was created/funded by banksters just to slow down and make hard the mass adoption of Bitcoin. all these "small problems" are well designed and programmed to make users to hate Bitcoin...

Yes Bruce is right, and how we fight that? Not using exchanges like Coinbase, using everything P2P, skipping the gov rules and regulation impose.  
That's why Bitcoin was invented! To be free, to have a full P2P economy.  
Satoshi's vision was to create P2P money that will make the gov intervention to be minuscule or zero.  
**Satoshi took the power of creating money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now people have to continue his work and move forward to a full P2P economy and society, that only with P2P money can be done!**

Look I was always warn here about Coinbase. Is not that I have something against this company in particular, not at all, I have something against banksters (and Coinbase is a banksters tool), Coinbase is not for newbies or not well informed people.  
But now with so many posts and articles about problems on Coinbase, is coming this question:  
- if these posts complaints are fake, are a nonsense or really trolls that just want to put gasoline on fire (we do not want that). If you already knew that the community knows about Coinbase bad practices, is useless to continue posting that you get screwed. Just stop using it and deal with that, move on, life continues.  
- if these posts are not fake, the OPs are really dumb and not well informed, do not read news about Coinbase or just ignore all the warnings and shit. So is their fault that they continue using Coinbase so again their complaints are useless and meaningless.  
**Do not complain anymore! Stop using it and done, move on to another exchange, are plenty out there!.**

Again come up this question:

If you still don't know about Electrum and also didn't use it, you better start learning more about Bitcoin wallets and then start implementing Bitcoin payments into your web.

I'm not anger, just vigilant.  
Do you think a gold certificate is also owning gold? Or just a scam?  
Vontobel is doing the same thing. Selling Moon land, something that is a promise to own. Bitcoin doesn't fit in that type.  
Do I have to remember this?  
**You don't control your bitcoins keys, you don't own the bitcoins.** PERIOD.  
Bitcoin is direct ownership through the private keys, not through a piece of worthless shit paper named "certificate".

LOL  
This remember me when I had bank accounts with ING (more than a year ago).  
In their online banking I had the option to name my bank accounts. In those times I was buying BTC with one of the ING accounts and I rename it Bitcoin - Be Your Own Bank.  
After few transactions, buying BTC through bitcoin.de, I received an email from ING questioning my txs for Bitcoin and the name. I answer them that IS NOT THEIR damn business what am I doing with my money.  
Next day they close my account, luckily I had zero € in it because I never keep money in a bank account.  
I send them an email saying that from that day I will close ALL my bank accounts with them and other banks and from now on I will use ONLY my OWN BANK - my BTC wallet. And that happened: from Jan 2015 I live on BTC and from Mar 2015 with NO BANK ACCOUNT! All closed.

Watch this:   
Living free and self-sufficient is not impossible and crazy idea. We are get used to think and have a life full of stuff and complicated. But in fact we can live free and simple and much longer than a stressful life in a big city.  
My temporary move from big city to a tiny village brings me a lot of advantages and one of the biggest: I am healthy than before. Much healthy. I have at least 10 years that didn't need to see a doctor. And I am every day much stronger. The air, the food, the state of mind, the people around you makes a life much better.  
An off-grid situation will be even much better. When you **see** a friend you really enjoy it and you will have **less real friends** not **tons of fake friends like in a big city**. A real friend is the one that give you a hand when you need it not when is coming to ask you to borrow him some money.  
In off-grid life you appreciate a lot your life and being alive and you enjoy it every second.

**"iPayYou wallet keeps all funds in your personal bitcoin account – not in our wallet. You retain full control – there is even a way for you to spend it without needing to log into our site. Your private keys are encrypted on our server and are backed up, backed up again and then just for safe measure, backed up again. Security based on 2048 bit certificates – no one can decipher the keys, even our employees."** - Do you believe this shit?!!!  
So, if the bitcoin wallet keys are mine, why should I keep them into their hands (even if the backed up and backed up), why should I pay fees to them when I can use my own BTC wallet ?  
You have been warned! You really want to put your money into hands of somebody that is not providing info about who really is?  
And normally when you see more than once per day a post about "promoting" a product/service, that is fishy like hell, suspicious to be paid shill.

Satoshi gave them power and they give back that power to the banksters...

Stupid people will always exist. It's the nature. And they are insignificant number in Bitcoinlandia that cannot affect the adoption.  
Bitcoin wallet it's yours and you are the one in charge with security. Fiat ATM are owned by banks and they are in charge with security but also once is hacked will affect more people at once not just one (like in Bitcoin case).

**Thank you Andreas, for being our new Socrates!**  
I was serious saying about that book and remembering you forever.  
If I will find time, maybe I will start by myself to write that book. But the thing is that you will always have to add something so should be like an open source book, that is never finished.  
Maybe you can find a way to create on your website or on that bitcoinbook.info a special page/place where people can find your great quotes? If you don't have time to put them together from your videos, I offer voluntarily to do that, for free of course, humanity will pay me later with the reconnaissance of the new Socrates.  
Note for all others here: I am not idolizing Andreas, sometimes I even not agree with him, but that is part of our life, to be human. I just want to give him the right place in human history.

**Everything is for a reason**.

[Coinbase was created by banksters]( Now you will say, ok so what? But..  Coinbase in hands of banksters is great tool to:  
- track everybody that is buying/selling BTC, for later "use" (why do you think they impose so many stupid KYC/AML rules?)  
- by their stupid internal policies, will do everything possible to slow down the adoption of BTC and/or making it hard to use for normal people that are using ONLY Coinbase. Just think about the timing of your withdrawals, time until your orders get executed, "technical problems" that makes a nightmare using their exchange, seizing funds for no reasons, seizing fund for stupid reasons.  
- putting funds into Coinbase you risk to have NONE, in any moment can be seized, they can stop you to withdraw/move, **[you NEVER have full control of your BTC keys](  
Using Coinbase you are taking a huge risk, so consider this a final warning...
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:17:37
Instant limits are applied when you buy BTC from any other exchange than Coinbase...  
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU

@_date: 2016-07-26 20:44:49
Nice intentions, but I consider that we are making too much noise for nothing. Why?  
Those "regulations" will apply to registered online exchanges and wallet providers. People will start discovering the P2P exchanges like bitsquare.io, localbitcoins, mycelium local trade and many others will popup like mushrooms.  
These kind of media hypes about "regulations" against Bitcoin are there just to scare the shit out the new comers and people that don't have patience to read more about or educate themselves, that they just take what MSM is presenting them.  
Politicians and govs knows very well that they can't stop Bitcoin but to slow down the hoarding and adoption, until they (think) will come up with a contra-crypto that will be presented like "the best solution to save the world" (sic), but in fact will be a fiasco.  
The fact is that govs are good in only one thing: **to scare the shit out people**. The rest are just lies and manipulation for weak minds.  
Wake up people! Dump the fiat use only BTC, we have enough for everybody! Nobody can stop you to use only BTC. I live on BTC for more than a year now and all is getting better and better.  
The Revolution starts by being paid in BTC not by merchant adoption. My employer after they start paying me in BTC they had to accept BTC for their services/products so will not be needed for them to buy BTC. They realized that it's much better now to accept BTC than buy it. Exactly like me, why should I buy it when I can earn it with my work directly?  
We already have P2P money - Bitcoin  
We already have P2P marketplace - OpenBazaar  
We already have P2P exchange - Bitcsquare.io  
We already have P2P lending platform - CredibleFriends  
Next will be P2P governance and will kick out all those dumb ass corrupt politicians and govs.  
Bitcoin just opened the Pandora's box of P2P, watch out what is coming!

SR case is a long term "case to finger point" by MSM and govs like the bad use of Bitcoin and that will be used to slow down the adoption of Bitcoin.  
Their initial plan was that SR will raise outrage against BTC and people will stop using it. And also to use Ross like an example of "what will happen to you if you continue to use BTC".  
But people, one by one woke up and start asking this question:  and in the end they realize that Bitcoin is not the "bad guy". So then gov realized that the SR case wasn't a "success" and for that they wanted to be finished and case closed quickly so people will forget to ask more questions.  
That's why now you are not seeing too much about this case on MSM. How many times you saw mentioned on MSM the SR case? Almost none. Do you really think is just a coincidence?
@_date: 2016-07-15 09:49:11


That is because of people like you, that are not helping Bitcoin to be used directly P2P, but pushing people back to use of VISA and fiat...  
**Bitcoin will never be adopted if people still use to convert into fiat through those cards**.

LOl I had the same thought but you was first in posting it :)  
WTF is wrong with these people? We are struggling to even have 1.0 (if we can version it like that), is not even adopted well and now we are "preparing" the 3.0 ?!  
I think this "trend" of version x.0 everything is a way to hide something that you are not capable to do. So you come up with a new x.0 that always is presented with more BS than previous and in fact is doing nothing more.  
OK I understand that you (not you OP) are a "visionary" and you think a bit more in the future, but when you already have a finite product, when the product already have a good based v 1.0 that works and everybody is happy with it. Then yes is time to think for more features, more x.0s...

Just explain me what is a "bitcoin certificate"?  
- A paper wallet where **they** keep the keys and you get the paper? No.  
- a paper that says: you own x BTC, stored in our vaults. That is a nonsense, you are not the owner of those BTC if you don't control the keys. Point and clear.  
- a paper that says, you give us x BTC with the purpose that we the bank, will trade with them and make more money. That also is a lie, you can forget those BTC to be yours forever.  
So in any case those "bitcoin certificates" are a lie, a nonsense to fool idiots.

I live on BTC for more than a year but, I'm paid in BTC, I spend in BTC (from my btc wallet) and I hold BTC that remains. This is living on Bitcoin not using those stupid fucking obsolete VISA cards.  
Those cards are loaded with fiat money, money that doesn't exist, are created from thin air, are IOUs.  
Bitcoin is real money, is mined, can't be counterfeit, can't be created endlessly, can't be lend endlessly (without having it) and bitcoin is PROPERTY (not IOUs papers).

What a BS, what do you mean by "record bitcoin transactions" ? Are already in the blockchain, they don't need another database to make a copy of the blockchain. And btw, those are just transactions, but never linked to a specific individual. So good luck to find out who did those transactions.  
And 1 question: what they will gonna put for the Satoshi's  first transaction? Terrorist?! And what will be his real name?  
This will be really hilarious to watch, I prepare the popcorns... What kind of morons are in the EU parliament? They should invite Andreas A. for a chat like Canadian Senate did, at least they will have an idea about how Bitcoin works so they will not bother in starting this BS with citizens money, wasting money, nothing else.

I live on BTC for more than a year, but not in US. US is really shity at BTC services.  
1st: **get out of Coinbase!**  
2nd: start demanding to be paid in BTC for your work, so you will never depend anymore to buy BTC.  
If still you can get paid in BTC, use the P2P exchange bitsquare.io  
3rd: use services like cashila.com, piixpay.com, bitbill.eu, bylls.com, coins.ph, bitwa.la to pay your fiat bills directly with your BTC wallet, with no need of bank account.  
4th: insist to your landlord to pay the rent in BTC (if you rent a house), find many places online where you can shop (are many many that you can use)  
5th: close all your bank accounts  
6th: live free!  
I did all these steps and I live free of fiat.

Yes, OB is one of the greatest apps with BTC that few noobs know/understand how it works. OB is a great opportunity to break the chains... Shame that is not well promoted.

Banks are "infecting" anything that touches, including their personal. No worth trying to explain them anything about Bitcoin, let them to remain in their shit until they will eat that shit that enter in their mouth.  
Look I am a bit of Bitcoin "evangelist" in my town but I never tried nor wanted to explain Bitcoin to a banker. They do not deserve it! We have to let them in darkness to know nothing about Bitcoin.  
FUCK THE BANKS AND BANKSTERS!

Politics is BS. An illusion of democracy.  
Bitcoin will bring **direct democracy**, politicians will be obsolete or insignificant for society (like a fax today).  
"governments' practical laws for preventing terrorism and human/drug trafficking" - Hahaha this is the best joke!  
**Gov IS** the one that fuel the terrorism, drug trafficking etc. not the one that stop it. **YOU** are the one that pays the bill for their games....  
I strongly suggest you to watch this very interesting talk about Bitcoin an wars:  will answer many of your questions (if you still have).
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:48:12
So now, seriously, why did you continue to use Coinbase? Or you didn't know/notice/find out their "evil procedures"? Why you rely on them so much?

**BITSQUARE.IO - a P2P decentralized exchange**  
BTC is P2P money, why not use also a P2P exchange?  
@_date: 2016-07-15 10:21:51
Even easier than that: a multisig wallet for the shop, and just a QR code for taking payments. Any merchant can do that for themselves. And cost zero.  
But you see? This is the thing: the actual vampires (payment intermediaries) do not want that Bitcoin will take over their commissions and blood sucking. because if merchants and people will start using the P2P money there is no need for "intermediaries". And they are afraid of that, so they come up with all kind of these "inventions" of "bitcoin debit cards", just to keep you in line with their shit.

LOL, the ad is not so weird, is quite sincere actually. But the weird question/situation is how will be delivered? So if I met the seller, will pass the BTC to her wallet and then she start milking her breast in a bottle? That will be a really weird situation :)

I make my invoices to my clients, expressed in fiat and they pay in bitcoin at the exchange rate.

Finally a post that is not about the fucking Coinbase!  
Good to hear!
@_date: 2016-07-24 07:22:56
Look I was always warn here about Coinbase. Is not that I have something against this company in particular, not at all, I have something against banksters (and Coinbase is a banksters tool), Coinbase is not for newbies or not well informed people.  
But now with so many posts and articles about problems on Coinbase, is coming this question:  
- if these posts complaints are fake, are a nonsense or really trolls that just want to put gasoline on fire (we do not want that). If you already knew that the community knows about Coinbase bad practices, is useless to continue posting that you get screwed. Just stop using it and deal with that, move on, life continues.  
- if these posts are not fake, the OPs are really dumb and not well informed, do not read news about Coinbase or just ignore all the warnings and shit. So is their fault that they continue using Coinbase so again their complaints are useless and meaningless.  
**Do not complain anymore! Stop using it and done, move on to another exchange, are plenty out there!.**
@_date: 2016-07-15 08:37:11
Hahaha very good said: **"there's nothing keeping anyone else from mining"**
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:01:41
try chip-chap.com, they have a nice mobile app too.  
But I strongly suggest to find another way to obtain BTC. Soon govs will implement more and more rules and regulations for buying BTC.  The best option will be to work for bitcoins or use P2P exchanges like bitsquare.io
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:21:20
Hahaha my bitcoin in a bank.... what a joke!
@_date: 2016-07-25 22:53:12
then use bitsquare, a P2P decentralized exchange, or Mycelium trade in person.
@_date: 2016-07-12 10:23:14
Then work for bitcoins and you don't need to buy anymore :)
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:22:27
I think is just a coincidence for the name. But who still believe in coincidences today ? ;)
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:34:04
Nope you are wrong, P2P government means WE decide for what needs to be done/paid,built etc, not some corrupt politicians.

I have many wallets that doesn't require to download the blockchain.  
One in particular is Electrum. Just save a tiny file of 30-200kb and done.   
Don't tell me that you do not have 200kb free space on your pc!  
Your post show us that you never read more than 1 page about Bitcoin, so you better start reading. There are tons of materials out there, you just have to type and search.
@_date: 2016-07-27 10:01:06
No, I don't have nothing against bitcoincracy, is a great tool and will be very useful in the future, but saying that a bitcoin user with lots of BTC in his wallets is important, that means nothing.
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:42:47
BTC debit card - nonsense, because you already have your own wallet, that can be used to pay. You don't need anymore the shity plastic cards that just charge fees to be intermediary.  
Bitcoin will never "innovate" banking, Bitcoin will make banking obsolete. Why do you need anymore the actual banking when you will be your OWN bank? You will need a credit? No problem all will be P2P.  
Enough with this enslavement of actual banking!
@_date: 2016-07-04 11:19:33
Don't worry about their "superfucking state". Bitcoin doesn't give a shit about it. Is just... borderless and unstoppable. :)  
That is just a sign that they are super fucked up and desperate. You should just buy BTC at a steady pace. They will do the rest... to fuck themselves.
@_date: 2016-07-22 12:42:45
bitsquare.io - P2P decentralized exchange, no fees other than your normal fees for bank transfer. Also you are always in control of your money/BTC. Anyway, move the BTC to your regular wallets to manage them better (electrum, mycelium etc)  
May The Coin Be With You!
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:21:34
EXACTLY! Future governance is a P2P governance, when people vote for common projects that need to be done, not for (corrupt) people that promise to do things in their name.

From that forced taxation you have also **WARS and military complex** that are taking more than 60-70% of all taxes are collected....

**With Bitcoin you cannot start wars!** it's impossible to fund wars with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:14:09
I will NOT recommend to anybody any wallet in particular, but I would say this:  
**there is no best wallet, but safe wallet**  
Use any of the wallets that you control all the time 100% your private keys.  
You better install and test all of them and see which one is most suitable/easy to use for your needs. My mom (60+yr old) uses 3 mobile wallets :)    
Mobile: BTC wallet Schildach (one of the 1st launched wallets), Mycelium, Airbitz, Electrum (you can use same wallet files from desktop version), BCI  
Maybe there are others but it's up to you to test them and choose the one you like.

I never said that I will exchange back to fiat those BTC.  
I live on BTC for more than a year and I closed all my bank accounts, so tell me in which phase I exchange the BTC back to fiat and I use that fiat.
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:49:19
And that's because CIA is not using Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:01:56
Sorry but you are more confused.  
I live on BTC for more than a year, I mean, I am paid in BTC, I spend in BTC, I HODL BTC. So for me fiat doesn't exist anymore.  
Fiat is way more **virtual** than anything else.  
When a bank is lending to you money is creating **virtual money**, those money doesn't exist before and they created from thin air.  
Bitcoin is created by a mathematical process and there is **proof** of how they was created. And what is more important: **A bitcoin can't be created or spend it twice or many times** You do not own it, you can't spend it.  
Seems that you need to read more about Bitcoin, check this book for you: 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:10:03
Yep, exactly. For more than a year now.
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:07:27
No, I think you do not understand. I never have to exchange for fiat. I closed all my bank accounts. I don't have a credit card, that is for slaves... All are gone forever. All I do is paying directly in BTC.  
I don't need you to believe me, I don't need your "approval", I live like that and I am happy and free. And that's possible where I live and because I speak with people around me and I convince them to use BTC.  
Fiat is going to be obsolete soon. This big fucking lie (of banksters) is going to end...
If where you live is still not possible that, maybe is time for you to move...

Maybe those EU fucking regulators didn't hear about these examples, where you can't watch/download/listen those artists work without paying **with Bitcoin**.  
But yes this is even worst then what they really want: to give a fucking fat commission from the artists work to the bloodsuckers. **They do not want that artists can sell their work directly to the people...**
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:05:56
Nope. Cashila.com is doing a great job in paying all my other bills that I can't pay directly in BTC. And also is linked with my Mycelium wallet, just one click and the bill is paid. No need of any bank account.  
I just explained to this guy how I do it: 
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:41:26

Ok but those bitcoin was bought with fiat and that fiat was printed by evil banksters with no reason...  
But hey, those who use Bitcoin also use internet, phones, socks, breathe air... and nobody is saying nothing AGAINST these "evil" things!  
But again we have a block of "media coverage" paid by banksters to put Bitcoin in the position of the "bad guy". Why? because their end is near and they are DESPERATE of losing against Bitcoin!

@_date: 2016-07-16 14:37:01
Actually I do not use bitsquare. I am paid in BTC for my work so no need for me to buy BTC.  
But for me bitsquare is the best option if I would have to buy. I wish I had this exchange back few years ago.  
Oh yeah now we have to demonize all P2P services, like Bitcoin too?! Those services don't need warnings, because they do not "share/track/sell" their users activities.  
Soon we will have even P2P governance so enough with imposing strictly rules for anything, just because they want to control the masses. We will regulate themselves with our own rules and regulations that doesn't violate any right.  
**Is not your damn business what am I doing with my BTC/money!**
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:42:12
Yeah I had almost the same "situation". But my response to the "POS BS reason" is: that POS, every time you touch it, is charging you a commission and you don't own those money. Bitcoin QR code don't and you own the money. The choice is yours.
