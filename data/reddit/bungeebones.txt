Isn't the way to disincentivize large mining pools is to tell the miners the truth - that a mining pool doesn't increase your odds one bit ... or am I forgetting the little bit I learned in one statistics and probability class?
As I see it the probaility is constantly changed by the difficulty. No matter how many miners pool together the difficulty adjusts for the whole entirety of the miners. Yes, the pool has a greater chance than any one individual but the pool doesn't give its proceeds to an individual It divides it among the pool ... according to their hashing power (which is what the difficulty factor does). But the operators of the pool take their cut off the top (just like the house in Vegas) so the miners (as a whole) actually get less than they would mining solely.

"According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the United States loses between $40 and $70 billion in tax revenues annually due to unreported earnings stashed in tax haven bank accounts. Globally, the Tax Justice Network estimates that figure soars up to somewhere in the neighborhood of $225 billion per year."
BlockChain.info reports the current market cap at just under 7 billion. Realise that the above numbers represenet the TAX SAVINGS and not the total amount of capital kept in the tax shelters. If/when that money does flow into Bitcoin it will not be for specuylation and will tend to stay for a long time, thus raising the cap rate through the ionosphere.

The author misuses the word "dollar" even though that is it's common usage. Replace evry mention of the word "dollar" with "Federal Reserve Note" for a lot more clarity on what is really happening. The "dollar" is a approximately one oz silver coin manufactured by the US Mint still to this day. There is absolutely nothing wrong it it or with its value. The Bretton Woods accord made the mistake of pegging the Federal Reserve Note to gold. When Nixon orchestrated the default of the Federal Reserve gold backing he essentially made the Federal Resrve Note a bounced check. It had been a promise to pay the bearer a certain number of dollar's worth of gold but from then on it was a promise to pay nothing.
By calling the Federal Reserve Note what it is (i.e. an empty promise) you avoid their phony hearttug at patriotism to raise support for preserveing "the dollar". I say let the Federa Reserve Note go on it's the way to the brain fart dung heap with all the other stupid ideas in human history like the flat Earth and blood letting.

Isn't part of the tax payer's game to 1) Review their 65,000 plus pages of regulations 2) Hire a professional who supposedly knows what they mean 3) Run the gammit between taking the riskiest of deductions or the safest of deductions 4) Getting audited by some bureaucrat who claims to understand the 65,000 pages 5) Have the bureaucrat determine that you viloated one obscure tennet and 6) seize your funds
thus leaving you without your funds on a whim of a bureaucrat because they were left so unprotected. You would left with the option spending more money to get your money back while the tax authorities have unlimited taxpayer funds to defend the most rediculous legal positions imaginable. 
And then of course, as history has demonstrated, if you are on the opposing political party those 65,000 pages of tax laws will be used as a political weapon against you.
I think jumping to the presumption that they are guilty of fraud is just guilt by association because they have their money in a tax HAVEN. I think tax fraud and tax havens are two distinct, different things. The tax havens provide anonyminity (just like Bitcoin). That feature is why they are being attacked by the taxing officials and not because they are harboring know tax fraudsters. I believe the taxing authorities have all the legal means to apprehend them if they do, indeed have proof they violated the law. The tax officials want to know EVERYONE who has an account.
It's all about anonyminity.

I had the same gripe with TigerDirect. But what makes it even worse, you couldn't add to the store credit balance with Bitcoin. In other words, had the option of 1) Spend the exact some amount as the store credit 2) Spend as near as you could to that amount and kiss the rest good by 3) Spend more than that amount and use a CC to make up the diff. When I took it up with the management they had the audacity to blame it on Bitpay. I quickly informed them that my hosting company has a Bitpay form enabling me to fund my pre-load account (same as a "store-credit") for any amount so it was just a coding issue of TigerDirect's web programmers. They still have $2 and change because I refuse to give them my CC info. If they aren't technically saavy enough to program such a simple accounting procedure I dread to think what their CC security might be.

I think a label of "hoarding" applied to Bitcoin is totally misapplied and it is, rather, simply a case of the effects of Gresham's Law (  being applied. Bitcoin is the "good" money being chased out of circulation by the "bad" money (the fraudulent, counterfeit, decimated Federal Reserve Note impersonating and masquerading as the dollar). Bitcoin (or Bitcoiners) aren't the root cause of holding Bitcoin but rather the phony Federal Reserve Note. End the Fed and the Bitcoin will flow.

When there was talk about the Post Offices becoming Bitcoin exchanges I was thinking that would make getting paid in Bitcoin much easier. One wouldn't have to "cash" their check.

Get them to split their investment in Bitcoin into three piles:
1) Chump change, spending money, play money, small change  etc. and open an app wallet on their phone to store and use it.
2) A "real" wallet on an online service such as Coinbase, Blockchain.info etc for an amount that they want to be convenient to spend online understanding that any online storage is risky but not as risky as dropping your smart phone.
3) A "Money Belt" stash that they want to be a little less at risk and less obvious (less a target) than a smart phone or online wallet and have them download and install a wallet on their pc such as Bitcoin core or Mycelium. The key point then is that they understand they control the keys but if they get hacked (because their PC is connected to the Internet) then they could be out their Bitcoin.
4) Lastly, a "Vault: version - Install Armory (online version) on that same PC and also install the offline version on a completely offline and dedicated pc where they store the keys and sign transactions completely secure from online hackers.

I don't see how ANY of the money in circulation is "clean" anyway! It all has been created out of thin air and given to special interest groups (including farmers, homeowners, construction companies, mitilary contractors et al) beyond even what they can create out of thin air to the point where they have to put future and present minors(i.e. not of legal age to vote and get "representation") into indentured servitude because one generation failed to pay a bill with yet even more funny money.
The entire system is corrupt from grandma and grandpa on down. It's as Jefferson said (I believe) .. :Once the populace realizes they can vote themselves money out of the public coffers democracy is finished" (or something like that). To pay with Federal Reserve Notes (or their digital counterparts) is to be part of the fraud. Keep calling them "dollars" and keep calling them "clean" if you want, but they aren't. It was all built on the blood of future generations.

I think any claim of legitimate taxing authority by a government issuing fiat money out of thin air, together with their spending more money than they can create out of thin air (how is that even possible) and then putting the burden of repayment onto the children and unborn (who have no vote and, therefore, no representation) is absolutely, positively bogus and fraudulent and without any legal basis and is morally repugnant. Practically speaking, they can create every bit of their tax revenue out of thin air at the same time they create the rest of it.

Actually, no one is going to understand that the money is debt as long as people call Federal Reserve NOTES (the word "note" being a sure sign of a debt) dollars instead of notes. 'The beginning of wisdom is to call something by its proper name" (Confucius).
Legally, a dollar is a one ounce silver coin issued by the mint. A Federal Reserve Note is a fraudulent, empty promise to PAY the amount of dollars printed on them.
Some real simple rules of grammar illustrate this as true also. A noun is a person, place or thing. An adjective describes a person, place or thing. The green, paper thing is what? A note (it says so). And what adjectives describe the type of note that they are? 1) Federal reserve 2) 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 Dollar notes. When one holds a $100 Federal Resrve Note you don't hold a hundred notes but only one. That is the one thing in your hand. If you held 100 $1 notes then you would have 100 things. . But the one $100 note cannot simultaneously be 100. The numbers on them are adjectives, not things.
Masquerading the Federal Reserve Note as a dollar is one of the biggest weapons of the fraudsters. FUDD is everywhere lamenting the pending collapse of the "dollar" but in reality it is the pending colapse of the Federal Reserve Note which should be a time of rejoicing, not lamentation.

People need to realize that by demanding that taxpayers report their earnings in dollars they can exchange Bitcoin for genuine US dollars produced by the mint and declare that as their proceeds. One US Dollar (a silver Eagle) sells for $25 FEDERAL Reserve Notes. The dollar sign is applied by commerce, not by law. The IRS is under the law and the law still says the $1 Silver Eagle is a dollar while the Federal Reserve Note says it is a note (i.e. a promise to pay a dollar) that doesn't pay anything. Just report 1/25 of the value in FRNs and pay the bill with the worthless FRNs (legal tender that they have to accept).

I think pre-mined is the only way to go if there is a product or service backing the currency rather than scarcity like Bitcoin is. Let's do a for-instance using MacDonalds, for example. If they were to create a McDCoin and use it as a promotion like they do their Monopoly game the coins would be "backed" by Quarter Pounders, McChickens and french fries. Whether they pre-mined 50 thousand or fifty trillion is moot. As a consumer/user of the McDCoin all I care about is how many burgers I get per coin.
The advantage of premining is the security isn't it? If all the coins are mined there is no need to distribute mining software and no threat of a fifty one percent attack - ever - because the MacDonalds corp. owns all the mining software itself.

I am totally for dismantling the Fed and the phony fiat money system and the debt driven enslavement system but this story gives way too much credibility to the Fed of it being a government agency. The Fed is NOT a government body and is, instead, a private corporation. ANY regulatory function it performs is strictly and totally as a trade organisation policing itself. With that said, why would any trade group with such a long history of fraud and corruption as the banking industry be expected to have in place a moral and ethical self-policing arm? The corruption happens because the police are corrupt and the corrupt keep the police they want in power.
The danger of presenting the Fed as a corrupt government agency is the very real possibility they will just start a public relations campaign to "clean up" their "government" agency and will be given another long term lease to continue to function as a private, self policing body.

I use the approach "Bitcoin compared to what?" They need to learn it in relation to what they know:
Bitcoin compared to credit cards (1950's technology - compare a 1950's car to a car of today)
Bitcoin compared to central banks (both have centrally planned money supplies but Bitcoins is fixed/cast in stone while the CBs "try" to figure it all out)
Bitcoin compared to fiat money: Both are created "out of thin air", both are digital (the Euro has a small percentage in actual cash right?)
Bitcoin compared to banks (A Bitcoin wallet basically enables a person to be their own bank. They can "write checks", make "deposits", send "money wires" "send remittances" etc no matter how poor they are. Stress the opportunity for the unbanked to be able to get banking services.
Maybe Bitcoin vs EU. It (Bitcoin) can function as another currency within their borders in competition to the Euro for those that want that.

"Taxpayers must include the fair market value of Bitcoin payments for goods or services as part of their gross income, the IRS said. The fair market value would be calculated as the U.S. dollar value on the date payment was received."
Can someone help me with this please?
The U.S. Dollar is what? According to Dr. Edwin Vierra (he's a lawyer and has, ahummm, four PHDs from Harvard) he writes that the U.S. Dollar is a silver coin officially produced by the US Mint.
Which is one of those silver thingys right?
So, if I understand what the IRS is telling me correctly I take the value of the Bitcoin I sell and convert it to US Dollars. If I sell it for US Dollars (like that silver thingy) I'm fine with doing that. What do I do if I sell it for Federal Reserve Notes? Do I divide the amount of the number of Federal Reserve Notes (I mean what they are denominated) by the then current price of a US Dollar and report that?

Gresham's Law says that "bad money chases good money out of circulation". The US government is letting good money (Bitcoin) back out into circulation to retrieve their own bad money OUT OF circulation ... just the opposite.

Your charge of me being an anti-semite is ludacrous and without any foundation what-so-ever. You are engaged in a typical "straw-man" false argument and, in this case, a totally false accusation.
But if the metaphoric term I used bothers you then please, suggest any other equally derogotory and repugnant term and I will degress. I will not budge an inch, though, on how disgusting the people that sold the children of this country into debt slavery are. 
There is only one way out of this mess they made. They can print all the trillions of dollars it would take to pay off the debt (and the unfunded liabilities they have made) and, at the same time, pass a mandatory balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Then, and only then, are they enabling the children of this nation the same right of "no taxation without representation" that this country was founded on. There is no way these corrupt politicians (bought and paid for by the bankers, corporations and other special interests) are representing the unborn yet they pass the debt onto them. Or, I suppose, there my be some magical way to give the yet unborn the right to vote their greedy asses out of office but I don't know of any way to do that.

No, you are receiving benefit from things you have no intent of ever paying for and for which children and the as yet unborn will end up paying for. This country was formed over "No taxation without representation" but this generation is a bunch of scumbags that puts the burden on the future generation. WOW tough guys, like they can even put up a fight! A generation of wimpy aholes that think their smart taxing kids!

The man is daft! Seems his biggest issue is that Bitcoin was the tool of Silk Road. If that is a reason to ban Bitcoin what next, the Post Office, UPS and Fed EX because the drugs weren't delivered by carrier pigeons!
And since the Post Office, UPS, And Fed Ex all used trucks and planes to deliver the illicit products then those means of transportation should be banned also! 
And while we are at it, how about the automobile? If we are going to clean house then, by all means, get it done. Ban automobiles too because, as every one knows, criminals love to move fast. What kind of a getaway could they make with bicycles right? We certainly need to keep such efficient technology only in the hands of law enforcement.

In real estate you can swap an apartment for land or a residence or an office building and they call it a "like kind exchange" (or at least they used to but they change the tax laws quicker than a nursery changes Pampers). I would think trading one alt coin for another would constitute a like kind exchange if anything did.

Google is a wolf in sheep's clothing regarding Bitcoin. They haven't supported it, they operate what is essentially an information monopoly and now they actively profit by poisoning it!

I disagree. Money is delayed consumption. If I have possession of money it is because I have forgone immediate spending of it (thus I would no longer have it).
And on the other hand if I don't have money "now" it is most likely isn't because I never had any but rather spent all that I ever received (thus never delaying spending/consumption etc).
Debt is usually an attempt to spend in the present time the expected income from the future. Add interest onto the debt and the result is less spending in the future than what you would have had to begin with without the debt.

In January I got our students to get wallets and gave them each a few bucks worth of Bitcoin TO TEACH THEM personal money management and economics. That didn't include letting them "play in the street" of false cost analysis about the economics of mining. And avoiding the topic by going off into "alt coin" land where their only protection against 51% and transaction maleability type issues (both past and future) is their "stealth through worthleseness" approach. Having kids mine worthless or next to worthles alt coins without analysis is no more valuable a lesson than mining Bitcoin without one.

You're comparing apples and oranges. That is a comparison of Federal Reserve Notes (wortless I.O.U. nothings) compared to real silver coins. The current value of a real silver dollar to a FRN is around $22. Multiply all the amounts "it" will buy today by 22 to get an accurate picture of what the "dollar" is worth today. The amounts posted reflect the picture of what the FRN is worth today. (Zimbabwe, here we come)

How about a "Get Us Out Of Debt" Manifesto?
1) We call things by their real name ... A Federal resrve Note is not a Dollar dipshits (politicians, lawyers, accountants et al). Go back to grammar school you duffus and learn the difference between a noun and an adjective. And bamkers, all those mortgages that say people owe you "dollars" are bullshit, pure bullshit because the "meeting of the minds" and the understanding between the parties was that they would pay back Federal resrve Notes.
2) The same points apply to the national "debt". In case you didn't know it China, Japan, Saudi Arabia et al, the money you loaned us was our own money created out of thin air. But you did know it you liars and thieves because all your dumb asses do the same thing.
3) So, here is what we do to "settle up". We create out of thin air all the fucking Federal reserve Notes they say we owe and we pay the bastards off, in full, next week! And Voila, we are debt free! Year of Jubilee is here.
Some might try to make the claim that that would be immoral or unethical but how could that be? They accepted money from us in payment that they knew we created out of thin air. They loaned it back to us under the conditions that we paid them back with even more money created out of thin air. And we are? I don't see where the problem would be?
But the baby boomers with their retirement funds would be wiped out. How did they not see it coming?
But what they want to do is to keep bullshitting the kids by not admitting the truth, that it is all a ponzi scheme. And if they can just keep the kids dumb for a little bit longer they might be able to get out on time. So, don't do as they tell you kids. Do believe the truth and just plain common sense. You can't create money out of thin air. Settle the fact that that is what they do. But want some salt on that wound? They managed to spend more than they could create of of thin air! How the hell is that even possible? Someone forgot to hit the zero on the key board?

I enabled the student body of a K-12 school with blockchain.info wallets and gave them each a few dollars worth. I also paid some of the older students for work with Bitcoin. Overall I'd say it was a good experience for all (except the BTC price dropped). 
I also got some of the students to post their BTC addresses on their articles posted to the school blog and drummed up some donations for them. That put some smiles on their faces when they got money for their homework!
That inspired Blog4Bitcoin.club, a Wordpress MultiUser site I am developing to enable students to post their homework, essays, projects, theme papers etc. online and earn Bitcoin from it.

Why would anyone with half-a-brain "lend" to someone that could " create as much money as they want (out of thin air)? To say China is ignorant of the fact that we (the US and entire Western World) create our money out of thin air would be absurd because they (China) too create their currency (the Yuan) in the same way. They even peg it to the US dollar and, so, match our inflationary practices step for step. Fundamentally, it is a cultural battle between savers (China and the Asian countries in general) and the borrowers/debtors (the Western countries). Debtors who start to think they are too much in debt to be cut off from borrowed funds are fools. And when the funds are withheld they will still lack the discipline to live within their means. That's the real issue.

I think the Bitcoin opponents have gained the "moral highground" so much that even many Bitcoiners themselves "feel dirty". Perhaps part of the image update is to sling the mud back and let those that participate in the fraud (that is fiat money) and incredible national debt fostered on the unborn (when all they have to do to pay it off is "print" some up) know that they are the moral degenerates. The Magna Carta is 500 years old and one of its major tenets was "No taxation without representation". We have degenerated morally to a historical era before Columbus discovered the New World. What next, bringing back the Rack and the Iron Maiden?

Because of changed social paradigms. Our ancestors had both "savers" and "hoarders" as two, distinct behaviors. In our debt and consumer society "saving" has become "hoarding" and is considered anti-growth and anti-social behavior.

The problem is putting all bitcoin storage systems under the one heading "wallet". You don't ever store all your cash in your wallet right? You use safe deposit boxes, checking accounts, savings accounts, money belts, wallets, cookie jars and mattreses.
There are different Bitcoin "wallets" for each of the security situations above. How secure vs. how convenient you want your access to be?
Most secure/least convenient - cold storage
Least secure/most convenient - centralised online wallets that are not much different than an email account keeping track of numbers

Something that always puzzled me about the Silk Road thing was how did they ship all those drugs? The media and politicians had a blast toasting Bitcoin as the means of payment but not one peep was made about the means of shipment? if the USPS can detect money they certainly ought to be able to find drugs one would think. And how about the private carriers (aka UPS, FedEx etc)?

No way can all those trillions go into cash ... not physically possible since only a small fraction (3% is hwat I routinely hear) of USD are actually cash. The rest are merely digits in a computer. The real question comes down to how would a system based on the ability to forever create more units ultimately crash. After all, the owner of the keyboard can "bail out" anyone with just a keystroke. My guess is that all the "digits" will flow into hard assets like gold, real estate, farmland, and any HONEST digital assets. Stocks are totally digital today too and there is no monitoring of their actual production. That leaves only hard assets and blockchain based assets left standing.

I think it "might" be good. It wouldn't be just the central Banks creating their own but also the Walmarts, the MacDonlds, Wendy's and Burger Kings as well. And after the dust settles, and everyones realizes what they and Bitcoin REALLY are, they will realize the one with the strongest network of miners is the best, most secure place to store your value and conduct business. 
They would not only have to get a huge mining pool together but would also need an isolated support system such as their own wallet. Bitcoin and all the other alt coins are way ahead of them in all those areas. EVEN if they make their alt coin a FIAT currency that could pay their taxes they would still have to secure it against double spending and the 50% attacks that the system is susceptable to. 
After all that though, why bother? Just use Bitcoin and save the hassle and expense!

There are a number of benefits my idea has over a laptop. Assuming apples to apples (i.e. new laptop vs. new ssd harddrive) there are a lot of benefits to my idea:
1) lower cost
2) fewer points of falure
3) easier storage
4) less prone to damage
And my idea uses the Linux (Ubuntu) operating system which is IMHO more secure which should be installed on the laptop anyway.
And depending on the value of the Bitcoin in storage I would not want to use an old, used laptop for such a potentially valuable asset. 
Re: the RaspberryPi, I love it and have used it  but with my idea I can use any available PC that has the USB. And the key is stored on an SD card. A little too flimsy to let me sleep at night with a wad of Bitcoin on it. They're too easy to lose and too easy to forget and leave behind. I could put it all together on a thumb drive but chose the larger, more reliable SSD for those reasons.

The only problem is that it legitimizes the idea that Congress has some sort of oversight capabilities (along with all the other governements) but the reality is they have none as I see it. Bitcoin is a protocol and anyone, anywher that knows how to function within that protocol can irregardless of whether or not Fincen agrees or not. If they insist, they can force Bitcoin underground in the US and it will pop up again in BitEasies (the Bitcoin equivalent of Speakeasies). Those that stand in its way will be branded for life and lose their positions of authority. 
That lady at Fincen made a career move. So haven't the Congressman and Senators. Give them enough rope and they will hang themselves. They are all elected and appointed to act responsibly so when they don't (as she has demonstrated) she will pay the price politically and career wise. If she's a lawyer let her go back to defending traffic violations or something.

It all depends on where you start the "tit-for-tat". IMHO, the entire fiat system is built on fraud. So, yes your system may look prosperous, and even self righteous and benevolent, but in the end it is all ill-gotten-gain. Nothing in life is free. Someone lost out because of the unfairness of the system and paid for it. The fundamental ethical question then is, can you live with your conscience while living off of ill gotten gain?
