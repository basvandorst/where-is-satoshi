Preach! The argument over the name isn't helping core's image. It's like the thinking has shifted to: if you can't beatem' on the tech, beatem' on the brand name.
(kind of curious how many downvotes ill get in this sub)

Wow what a coincidence, Hal knew Dorian. Going along these lines, who knew Hal personally and may have heard of Dorian thru him?

Thanks for this. I had to read it twice and watch Antonopoulous's video about CME futures (released yesterday) to have a broad understanding what you wrote. Still not sure I get this whole thing down. Not a finance guy.
I do think people need to understand the momentum ignition concept and how they can be led by the nose thru futures. Your explanation here is great but too technical for your average Joe. Need to simplify it a bit.
Here's my stab at a TLDR:
The CBOE/CME futures is first and foremost a signaling mechanism, BUT NOT FOR BETS ON FUTURE PRICING BETWEEN THE BIG BOYS. Rather it is a signaling mechanism the big boys play with to fuck with the smaller guys' heads. They're not signaling for any reason than to whip the masses into buying and selling frenzies into which they "fade" the trend and buy/sell massive $ amounts without fucking up the chart with massive 100 story dildos. So moral of the story, don't be a newb and panic at the futures price. Remain calm and carry on hodling.
