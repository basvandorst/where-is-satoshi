A lot of that sentiment that I've heard have been coming from traders who've been trading for less than a year, have only known a strong bear market where it's fast and easy to make massive profits shorting it all the way down the bubble's deflation. They don't know a blockchain from their butthole and don't particularly care to. That is, they really don't care one way or the other about the tech, it's just easier for them to make money down. There's also a large contingent of traders who just consider any currency not backed by a government to be inherently a 'Ponzi scheme' and enjoy taking money from those they think of as foolish.
They make me laugh and laugh at their antics, especially now as we transition to a bull market.

Banks require great trust to operate. I do not trust them. A blockchain requires no trust. I trust it greatly. Thus, the only question remaining is how much to trust the tech surrounding it. BCI is certainly a nasty failure mode, but there's plenty of simple things you can do to have utterly secure matresses (y'know... wallets with a ton of cash in them).
It will take a lot of learning and change before society figures out how to deal with crypto, but in the mean time I trust my own judgement a lot more than I trust that of the banks.

Reasonable people can value different tech for different use cases. They can value it more than the notional network effect that would be gained by a monoculture. The fact that you don't value the utility they gain is a problem, yes, but... it's your problem.

One thing to make clear here: 'wallet' is a really bad metaphor for what's going on. A better way to understand it is as a "keyring inside a safe". You know the combination/passphrase that unlocks your safe/wallet. That lets you use your keys to access your bitcoin. 
You never need a 'place' to store your bitcoin -- all of them are right where they were first found: on the blockchain. But, to extend the metaphor, each one has a locked up ledger saying "I was owned by x, then y, then this account." The keyring lets you open the ledger and add to the record. "I now belong to Bob. ". At that point your keys don't fit the lock to that coin anymore.
Does that make sense? When I "send" you 10 bitcoin, I metaphorically walk up to the blockchain, find 10 bitcoin labeled "I was last sent to Stunspot", unlock their ledgers, and add "I was last sent to lukeawilson" at the end, thus making only your keys fit the ledger's lock. Your "wallet" is constantly checking for any bitcoin labled as 'sent' to you, see's the new lables, and updates your balance. 
I know... Pedantic and quibbly, but you'd be surprised how a clear understanding of the central narative of crypto can illuminate the whole thing.
@_date: 2014-12-15 07:59:54

Sigh. I was just elliding over the Born Rule - no point digging into how the sausage is made. But you don't need to assume two worlds for two outcomes. You can do things like treating reality/probability as your primary fundamental, with it weighting more towards one than t'other, ie, one outcome is 'more real'. Or look at it from a Wigner's Friend perspective: there's only as much seperation of worlds as there is propogation of information. As to the lack of wavefunction collapse... um... that's... y'know... its primary feature. That's the whole point to it. The math never talks about collapse, so let's assume it doesn't. Perceiving discrete events is exactly what you would expect in an uncollapsed wavefunction. You correlate your state with another system's state by observing it. You both go into superposition but stay correlated. So the bit of the system called 'you' that corresponds to the neural correlates of the qualia of perceiving the measurement are also in superposition. Many futures, single past. As to quantum immortality, I say, so what? Yeah, it's surprising, but so is the two slits experiment. To me it just says, "Be prepared. For everything."
But this isn't the 'Prove Your Favorite QM Interpretation' hour, so I'll just leave what I've already written.

The fact that he uses the idea of a negative feedback loop prominently in his article, but doesn't actually know what one is is worrisome. A negative loop is one that's self-dampening. A positive one self-exaggerates. It has nothing to do with direction of the effect.

@_date: 2015-01-20 09:16:10
Ok, what you are talking about is the local consistency of cause and effect in the presence of closed spacelike curves. And the answer is, we just don't know. It may be that time travel that causes change is impossible. ie. you go back to kill your grampa, fail, and then remember that story he told you one time about almost getting killed - this is a hyper deterministic timeline, and choice vs. free will depends exclusively on the perspective of the obsever. 
It may be that you go back, make a change, and the universe just doesn't care about globally inconsistent timelines. It doesn't matter if the whole thing is nonsense, as long as each event logically connencts to the next. This is like the Empodyclean paradox: The following statement is true. The preceding statement was false.  "I came back to change x. I succeeded. Which means I never would have come back. Which means x had to happen. And the universe is ok with that." This may be how the universe work. Call it Star Trek rules, since that's how their time travel usually worked.
The other major possibility is that the Everit-Wheeler-Graham Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (or its decedent) is correct. I'll skip the details, but the end result is that everything that is physically possible to encode in the universe, actually occurs.In bad movies they usually say something stupid like "every time you make a choice, the world splits into two parallel worlds", but that really downplays the situation and focusses on choice like it's relevant. What really happens is that every time a particle interacts with another, the universe splits into as many worlds as there are outcomes. (Or possibly something way weirder I wont get into here.) So, going back in time presents no issues to causality.You'd go back, kill your grampa/hack a blockchain, and there would be and always had been two worlds - one where you showed up and one where you didn't.
Now, like I said, we don't know which if any of these ideas are correct. But the MWI is pretty well accepted nowadays and is IMHO the only interpretation of QM that isn't batshit crazy. It may be testable, though, if we get a particular kind of quantum computer built.
But, let's assume you somehow build an ansible with bluetooth, yeah, you could fuck with a blockchain pretty bad. Just automate sending the answer to the block's mining problem back 10 minutes to your computer just after work starts. If you have transtemporal computation, you basically have unbounded computational power.

Hydra is an apt metaphor, but what you're overlooking is that regulation is the molten lead Herc and friends used to kill the fucker. 
If the US, Canada, and the Eurozone said "It's illegal to buy, sell, or barter cryptocurrencies with our money", bitcoin would be stillborn. Oh, sure, it wouldn't "die" but it would be relegated to a curiosity for a century at least. 
No, our real hope isn't crypto's invulnerability, but, rather, its strangeness and novelty. That and the saurian-like lightning reflex adaptability of Zippy the Wonder Slug, er, I mean "institutional banking and governance interests". Basically, crypto is so godsdamned _unprecedented_ in its potential scope for radical personal change that I don't think the Powers That Be will barely bother to notice it until it's far, far too late.

Proof of Stake. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (aka mining) as the mechanism for distributing the money supply, which is fixed at 21 million bitcoin total. 
 Other coins use Proof of Stake (proof that you have a 'stake' in the health of the coin in the form of ownership). In practice this means you compound interest and that's how new coins are created.
Some people have severe technical and philosophical problems with this, but I do not find them convincing. So, I bought some HYPER which pays 5% per month and have been quite happy with it. And since this is the bitcoin subreddit, and some get cranky when people talk about alts, that's all I'll say for now.

Well, it seems to be at or near the bottom of a yearlong bear market. Anyone who isn't a permabear that thinks the technology is inherently a Ponzi scheme is expecting a big turnaround in the near future. Last year was a deflating bubble filled with massive infrastructure building and bringing in lots of new money. I expect bitcoin and general cryptocurrency to explode this year and now is a great time to buy for medium to longterm holding. That's what I'm doing.

I don't get it. Everything they've been saying has been consistent with what they've said before. To me, they seem pretty professional. Or is this just FUD?

Well, it was nice of Kim Dotcom to push the price up. Let's see if it takes.

I would love 100 bits...

Oh, as to where it will be in the future... think about market cap. Right now, the whole bitcoin network, the single most powerful supercomputing pool on the planet, is market valued at less than a tenth of what they paid for WhatsApp. That seems ludicrously low to me. So, figure out what your think the network is worth and divide by the number of bitcoin. A million doesn't seem crazypants to me.

Another option is to buy a PoS coin. There are one or two that are quite reputable (I personally own a fair amount of HYPER and it stakes 5% per month).

No, you need to transfer it to your personal wallet, or there's a web wallet that either just came out or is about to which stakes.

It would take a pretty concerted effort to take out the internet and compitetitor nets. Basically, crapocalypse like Mad Max that took down the prerequisite infrastructure.

They get half because when two people get married, their two lives become one - emotionally, spiritually, and _financially_. There simply ISN'T Mine and Yours, there's just Ours. 
So, when you get married, your choices are to either get a prenup, use multisig with your spouse having a sig, or be a lying scumbag fucklehead who doesn't deserve a partner.

I dont care about "God", but the concept of financial union is the one relevant to this conversation. Once women stopped being property of their husbands, such a union became pretty universally recognized. It is mete and appropriate for a prospective wife to marry with that union being her understanding. Most ceremonies have vows explicitly saying such. To act as though that were not the case is simply dishonest.
Like I said: get a prenup if that's not the deal you want to sign up for. That's what they're there for. But saying "I have altered the arrangement. Pray I do not choose to alter it further." and then acting aggrieved when someone calls that shitty, childish behavior is, itself, shitty, childish behavior.

There's several exchanges but most people buy at bittrex.com . If you're interested, do some research. The main website for the project is  .
