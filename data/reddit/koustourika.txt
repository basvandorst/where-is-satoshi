Hahha no worries, as I said I really appreciate when people are informative. We need more smart people even if they don't get sarcasm :)
Could you explain to me what is /s or how to use it? I'm non English native and never seen /s... 
It might be useful for me, you know French people love rhetorics :)
Edit: I guess I simple have to add /s when I do sarcasm, right?

Nobody knows the future. 
One thing is sure: I never buy during or just after a big rise like that. Market is market.  
Edit: ok that's real for alt coins. My opinion about bitcoin is different. I see it like a strong long term investment. Just buy some every time you can, at the lowest price you can (mostly during dips). That's all. I don't imagine the value of Bitcoin going drastically down over the time because I think Bitcoin is about to stay with us for a VERY LONG time, so I only see the price (globally) going up over time. That's maybe just my opinion.
Yup after big up I'm always waiting for the dip after. And it happened that waiting for the dip I had lost the train for the moon so there is no real good answer here
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:01:00
Don't think like that.
Just buy now.
And if there is a dip later: just buy more. 
That's what I do with Bitcoin not with altcoins of course.
This is the best investment advice I can barely tell it will keep work over time. It worked pretty well since now and I'm confident about the future (EFT)

You can change fees in option for BTC in jaxx.
It is up to you to choose between low fees, normal fees or high fees. Of course the cheaper the longer, you'll have to pay more fees to get a quick transactions.
Don't worry all those fees issues will be done when IOTA will take on the world..
Edit: whow actually you have paid 15$ fees while your option was NORMAL... fucking expensive for a "normal fees" transaction I can admit!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:54:51
That was ironical from me. But thanks for the time you took to add some interesting and informative stuff in your answer ;) 
Edit: sorry I replied like if you was the original poster so that's an honest thanks for being the one giving informative details here ��
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:10:59
Have you read what I have written just above this text. I clearly explained WHY I think like that for BTC only.
And this is just my opinion you know Îm probably dumb enough my 5 year French diploma in economy and sociology worth nothing that's it? Smh

Stored on a Ledger Nano S doesn’t mean the money isn’t in the blockchain.
Simply transfert the money to a marketplace (exchange or any place where you can sell your coins for fiat or for other coins). Like with any other paper or digital wallet.
The secure aspect of a Ledger Nano S is that your private key is stored in it, and not on your computer.
