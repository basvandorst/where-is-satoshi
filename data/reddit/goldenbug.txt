Well, we still have plenty of homeless people in Pensacola, I guess they are just well-fed?
I think Jason is a good guy and well intentioned, but you either play along with the system or you don't at all. I think that's perhaps why they haven't continued to gain traction.

I doubt the elite would be able to move their shares without the market being tipped off. An algo could identify increased volume and ramps into/out of stocks before a news event.
Also, the market moves in mysterious ways.  I think insiders would get wiped out on bad predictions. Apple is a great hype company to see this pattern.  Example: Record profits! - $10 a share! Oh wait, the street was expecting it to beat $10.50.  Stock tanks.

Yeah, i saw this move and thought about arbitrage. 
Mt Gox was trading about $10 higher than BCE, a 10% opportunity.  Problem is, you would be stuck in a hole until Mt Gox allowed withdrawal, also, even normally it would take time to move back to cash to try it again, so not a pure arbitrage.
However, if Mt Gox adds Litecoin, and allows trades in BTC/LTC all sorts of arbitrage opportunities will open up, with near instantaneous transfer and repeatability, which will really help smooth pricing across other exchanges that trade BTC/LTC.

Yes, Friedman just mentioned the current property tax system, which really has little to do with the Land Value Tax as developed by Henry George and geolibertarians.
