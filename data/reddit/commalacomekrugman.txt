Also, I will bet good money that a lot of these people are anti-semitic.

Partly correct, high-skilled immigration might hurt the group whose jobs are being directly competed against, but the consensus (and the evidence) says that it benefits the country as a whole.

To make a long story short, when immigrants come over they do increase the supply for labor but they also increase demand for labor because of what they consume.
You might object that it's only theory, but there's empirical, peer-reviewed research on this:
At least in the US, the only groups that are really hurt by low-skilled immigration are people without high school degrees. High-skilled immigration is pretty much beneficial towards all groups.

1. The RBER is a fun joke. 
2. These claims represent the consensus of mainstream economics as a whole. 
Don't believe me? Check the IGM poll linked.
Also, I fail to see why we can't have better job retraining programs and more effective welfare policies to help distribute those gains. Also, even the research on low-skilled immigration shows that negative effects might not be as bad. When Cuban refugees doubled the labor pool in Florida, nothing happened to wages. 
What other concerns do you have?

In common usage, nobody takes "I believe in free markets" by itself to mean, "I'm an anarcho-capitalist." 
Take a look at all the other dictionary definitions of economic ideologies. They're all pretty abysmally off. The definition of socialism is so weak and broad that it can be used to define neoliberalism. On that point, neoliberalism's "official" definition is so bad that nobody who calls themselves neoliberal actually means that.

Given that you're the only person I've seen who uses that definition, I'm going to argue that you're being pedantic.

Smaller government while being a good step forward in granting everyone an equal opportunity to succeed. Just because he believed in free markets didn't mean he was against welfare or government intervention like an Ancap.
