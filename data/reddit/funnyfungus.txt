I've read that WTF? link and I still don't get it... that big red "wall" means that someone's trying to buy a ton of btc, and the market doesn't know if it can supply it?

Is it too late to participate in this? I found some typos here: 
1) "times thowed the real outcome" -&gt; "time showed the real outcome"
2) "the massiv 24.93% increase" -&gt; "the massive 24.93% increase"
3) "the second small one was even loosing place 3" -&gt; "loosing" should be "losing" and "place 3" should be "3rd place". However, I would reword this clause as "the second small spike occurred when they lost the 3rd place match"

EDIT: One more from this page: 
Instead of the first sentence "When people buy a miner in order to make profit with this investment this constitutes basically a bet on the future development of the difficulty" I would write "When people buy a miner in order to make profit, this constitutes, basically, a bet on the future development of the difficulty" (note the comma placement)

But it seems to me that arbitrage should make all the markets interlinked. Assuming the fees involved in leaving one market and entering another stay constant, I would think that the difference between the values of btc on different markets would stay the same. If it's ever profitable to buy on one market and sell on another, then people will start doing so, increasing the supply in the market they're selling to and driving the cost down.

I see. So the red line must be the amount of people selling at or below a certain price, and the green line tells you how many people are bidding at or above a certain price. Is that correct? 
Also, where do you get that 20K figure from? Can you read it from the graph?
