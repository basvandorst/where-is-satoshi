Yes of course I know about homesteading. I whole  lot of libertarian thought is dependant upon the concept(in fact I would say it is the fatal flaw in all libertarian thought). You have to at least admit that the concept is far from rock solid. Its a compromise libertarians make. 
Think about it for a second, working on the land for an unspecified amount of time gives me ownership of it forever. Surely there are subjective criteria for how much work and for what amount of time.
If I work on the land that is owned by another person should I receive part ownership of it?
Geolibertarians recognize that land can never be owned by a person because it was not created by a persons physical labor.

I dont think this is the *only* way. In fact their are many many more. The land value tax proclaimed by geolibertarians seems far more fair to me. 


Thats not really true. if that were true why would areas of land with high deposits of gold sell for more than other areas?


Hah I dont own any bitcoin. If I did I think I would have a right to the labor I put into mining them or buying them. That doesnt mean that you own 100% if the right that I dont. It means everybody does- so I wouldnt be apposed to being taxed on them.

Ok so bear with me, if every single thing I create requires natural resources then this statement turns out to be untrue-


The person who owns the natural resources that you used can have some moral claim to whatever you create.

You can not produce anything using just your body. Wealth is created when labor is combined with natural resources.

Why? this doesnt make sense? Everyone has the same right to those resources because nobody created them. Everybody has the same right to natural resources as anybody else.


Your pointing out flaws in modern statist society. I agree.. I dont know what that has to do with me pointing out the flaws in libertarian philosophy. I do however think its better than what libertarians are proposing. In part because it runs much deeper than what Ive stated here-
If a person does not have a right to the land that they own, they also do not have a 100% right to anything they create from that land. Say I mine some gold from my land, I do not have a natural right to 100% of the value of that gold. I might have a right the value of labour I put in to getting it out of the ground.

Dont you think theres a pretty good chance it will hit that low that it did a few weeks ago around 576? 
Theres been a bit of bad news today. Volume has been increasing, it looks like people are selling off.
