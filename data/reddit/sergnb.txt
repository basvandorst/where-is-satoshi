there was a sudden burst of a solid 1k increase that happened over the course of 45 minutes this morning. Ever since then people have been reacting to it, mostly with people getting caught up and getting their shitcoin profits back into btc. 
No clue what caused that first outburst tho. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:40:06
oh wow, sudden spike up, what the hell happened? Does this have anything to do with an event or did it just happen randomly?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:42:09
Oh, okay. Neat
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:48:13
one of the exchanges is showing 20k a bitcoin now. Shit crazy unstable these last hours. Give it some time to stabilize. It's like a finance trex walking around the charts and shaking them all up 
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:43:11
fell for like 15 minutes and went back to 16k, then fell for another 10 minutes. Still on the rising trend tho. Give it some time 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:34:52
they're both going up at a similar rate, i'd say the transaction fee ain't worth it 
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:39:34
when you know you are trash and you just own it 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:51:01
and getting massive idiot gains in the process?
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:02:30
and it's at 15.9k on bitfinex and gdax. Shit's unstable right now, can't tell a discernable pattern atm. That 1k in one hour rocket jump this morning shook things up. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:45:39
Went almost 1k up in like an hour this morning. What the hell was that 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:17:34
how do you know there's a buy wall incoming? just curious 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:27:38
Beeple is the man. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:11:48
congrats man. It's not a game for the weak of heart, but you made it through the finish line. Big props

Yeah, I'd like to think i'm being intelligent with this, it's too easy to get carried away with memes and circlejerks. Behind the freak outs, jokes, memes and sarcastic comments there is a reasonably high amount of sane advice going on in all of the forums regarding cryptos tho, which is good to see.
Ridiculously enough, I happen to have a bit of experience in markets and investing through steam markets (yeah, lootboxes, gun skins, betting, trading, all that jazz). The money I made from that time is a joke (I think I came out of it with like 107 dollars net profit and I thought I was such a cool kid, lol) but it was a good crash course on the risks of playing games with real money. I still remember the first time I lost 40 bucks in a day and it never rose back, and I'm very glad I got that burn at that time with such a low amount of money. I'd imagine if I had invested 5k on a whim on btc a week ago without research and I was sitting at 4k right now I'd be losing my mind. I hope not many people did something like that, and if someone did they are sane enough not to panic sell. The HODL memes are stupid sometimes but freaking out doesn't help anybody.

bitcoin, or huge anime boobs?

i bought at 15k thinking i was missing the ride. Didn't put much yet because I was just gonna try to test the waters and if i missed the rocket launch to the moon, i could still inform myself on other ways to profit from this rising market. 
Seeing my money dissapear from my wallet is sobering indeed but it's also reassuring, in a strange way. Seeing the chart go and up and up only made me think "there is no way that's gonna stay like that for long", so i'm glad to know correction and a bit of sanity are capable of happening even in crazy times like this month. I'm extremelly cautious with "get rich fast" promises and I never really truly believe them. This was the first time i felt the tug of the good old "fear of missing out" dog, and i'm glad i didn't go ALL IN with just one week of research behind my back. 
It's a freakout but i think the slap on the wrist will be benefitial in the long run for many people that are new to this game.

Tends to fuck up and not actually save comments when i check afterwards for me, for some reason. This is safer :X
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:50:54
what is this sub anymore
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:31
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:15:35
replying to this so i can find it later, good info
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:08
Well, don't sing in relief yet, the dip hasw been going up and down, but mostly down, for the past 4 days. It's still early to call in the "we bottomed out" shots. There could be more to come

newbie here: which ones do you think have more future, tech wise?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:42
I mean googling it is faster than asking what it is. Here's the crux of it, the Monte Carlo fallacy basically consists on the statement that if something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, if something happens less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature).
I'm not stating he is right in calling it that, i'm not even sure how it applies to this case as it's more of a gambling related fallacy. Just came here to provide info
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:39:31
If i saw a dude wearing  that in a concert or festival nowadays I would think he looked fly tbh 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:56
Yup, I am. I don't mind losing what I put in at all. It's a very low amount comparednto my other sources or income 
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:05:33
This sub is such trash, jesus christ 
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:44:46
y'all guys with this bullshit. How are you fucking dollar cost average an unstable-ass crypto market. It don't work like that 
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:59:21
it's fitting that the moon never gets any closer 
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:35:14
But he is right tho
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:59:39
I just checked in after 2 weeks of break
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED 
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:37:08
this sub is trash 
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:36:08
If you find yourself defending shitty ass memes with the childish "lol you are so bitter why so serious lo lol" excuse, it is you who needs to reevaluate things. This shit is low effort trash.
You sound like the people at r/funny man
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:25:41
Every single time I call you people out you reply with the same attitude. "lol why so triggered lmao". Get a grip my guy, I'm not the one triggered, you are the one getting defensive about shitty memes, not me.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:02:50
You realize you are doing exactly the same, right? I'm allowed to say content is crap when it is. I don't have to waste 7 hours making content to make this point. This "if you don't like it make something better" argument makes no sense mate.
Like Jesus christ, I said this feels like I'm browsing r/funny but I didn't know it would go to this extent. People getting defensive about shitty memes is the hallmark sign of a community reaching critical shithole levels. That December bubble really did attract the lowest common denominator I guess
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:33:53
I was wondering the same thing. I subbed to this sub expecting discussion and I've been getting nothing be Facebook tier memes for the last 5 months.
I mean if at least they were clever memes or something I would find then funny but these memes are literally all variations of the same "we have bitcoin we are so smart everyone else dumb lolz". Everytime I open one of these I leave thinking how insecure and childish this community is. It's like browsing a thematic r/funny at this point
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:23:37
Like you are adding any value 
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:38:53
New meta: being offended by having your shitty humor called out and complaining about people who think this low effort Facebook-tier crap is funny 
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:37:28
And the amount of people defending them are greater than those who thing they are stupid. Think it's about time to leave this shithole, at this point it feels and reads like a thematic r/funny
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:13:30
newbie here, exactly what charts and what subreddits are you looking at? It would be helpful to know what the fuck is going on
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:16:48
thanks mate
