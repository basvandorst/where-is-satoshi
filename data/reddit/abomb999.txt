why isn't an open source exchange dominating?

It's 5% of his net worth, a gamble, but nothing that will cause him to go busto. GL OP! I'm thinking of throwing 5% of my networth into bitcoin if it continues to bottom out, but I'm far from a decision on it.

"Losing even 50% of the time is fine if you're set ups involve payouts that are greater than 2:1 and you know how to exercise proper risk management. At worst you come out scratch… Next bus in 20 minutes."
If you're getting 2:1 you need to 33% equity or better, not 50%. If have 50% you can make 1:1 gambles all day and break even.

So are you saying the best way to launder stolen coins is through exchanges? Exchanges are like a black box?
Thief ( puts coins into exchange (  ).  then gives coins to many different address (  ...,  ). We now don't know which addresses are the thief's and which addresses are legitimate users?

But... but... R&amp;D costs! scientists won't do science unless they know their share holders are raking in billions in profits, and their industry is one of the most profitable on the planet. Check mate atheists!

Also currently gitmo and killing many innocent people with drones, and even if they are actual rebels, we are creating them. 
Also, our actions and hegemony have contributed to the creation of ISI; and like others have said, the US has  history of atrocities that far out number ISIS.

The government and the corporations overlap. The point is we live in a culture where we accept sick people being sick and trying to make billions in profits for the shareholders for medicine. There is something wrong with that, especially in the context of the government/corporations spending trillions in wars that are proven to have been ineffective. 
We should have a more compassionate form of capitalism. 
I would also argue that making drugs is so far advanced and complex, you can't really have a mom and pop R&amp;D farm, you need a large and resource rich network to do it. This in itself eliminates a lot of competition as few have the resources to get in to it, unless the people wanted to be taxed to create such a corporation, and I"m sure most of us would be ok with a greater percentage our tax dollars going towards health R&amp;D  instead of such a percentage of our taxes going to war.

I think BTC needs to be more useful first. I'm a noob but there are 3 apparent problems:
Security(Don't trust it, too easy to get hacked or threatened with physical violence and no recourse), Transactions per a second limit, and mining type problems( no incentive and 51% attack).

Mushroom trips abolish some people's despression. No more life time anti-depressants. Other people will mention other stuff.

1) Trust in a web wallet? Is there enough of a guarantee to get my money back if coinkite becomes the point of attack, i.e. they MTGOX me or hackers install some rogue script? 
2) How? I heard we're limited to about 7 TPS, even increasing the block chain only gives TPS # in the tens. Typical credit and debit TPS are in the 100k+ numbers.
3) We've already gone close with certain aggregate entities getting close to 51% of the mining share (ghash.io has twice come close to obtaining 51% of the bitcoin network's hashing power). How the fuck isn't this a practical current issue? With less miners, lower BTC value, higher energy costs, and more powerful mining hardware, it will only become more of an issue.

It was doing well. I played there almost everyday. Great HU action. Sad to see SWC close it's doors.
