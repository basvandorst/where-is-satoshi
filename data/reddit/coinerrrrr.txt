Go for it! I bought LTC at .47USD. I think at any point in the history of BTC, LTC (or perhaps any crypro thusfar) one could stop and come up with reasons not to buy in. 
On the other hand - If you need money to feed yerself, get outta crypto, or any high risk money thing.

Neat. Would that replace an apache server or is it used in addition to a regular webserver?

1. Create account on cavirtex.com
2. Select "deposit request" in the account section
3. Enter the amout you will deposit (last two digits are your account number, ie if you account number is 1234567 and you want to put in $100, then your deposit amount will be 106.7)
4. Write down or print out cavirtex's TD bank account number. 
5. Go to TD bank, go to teller, transfer the cash to the account. 
6. Wait a coupla hours (depending on when you deposit, they check their account every so often)
7. Buy BTC
8. ??
9. PROFIT!

Im interested in testing out your arbitrage project. . . Im wondering how I can add an exchange. The documentation on adding an exchange doesnt seem to exist. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:13:37
Ive been thinking about doin somthing similar. I think your plan is great and may implement somthing like it. 
Not too rigid. You need to ensure that you are profiting from the transactions and a 2% fee is cheaper than some exchanges (cavirtex). I think the customer would be happy with a clear pricing scheme for the coins they are purchasing. 
Heck, Id even suggest you up the fee to 5% or so,.. You are going out of your way to do somthing for someone that they could do themself; you offer a service of convienience. If I were clueless about interneting and whatnot but wanted to get in on the bitcoins, I'd have no problem using such a service and paying a modest fee.
Good Luck!

Sounds about right. Its really all about what you are comfortable with. Id keep an encrypted copy away from you computer, on a hdd usb stick (or six) perhaps. 


Yes, you can manually import your wallet.dat after installing a fresh copy of bitcoin-qt. By 'manually import' I mean you copy your wallet.dat file into the bitcoin folder via Finder.  The bitcoin folder is a hidden folder in you home directory, somthing like this:
you'll wanna double check that, Im on a linux machiene now and can't look to confirm. 
Bitcoin-qt may have a button to let you import as well. I usually do it manually.

I tend to not leave my currencys on btc-e... I get the sense that they probably are not out to screw anyone,... however they are in Russia, which is a long way away from where I live. So in the case of a big problem I feel I would have much less recourse in dealing with an out-of-my-country exchange than one that is local to me.

Apparently bitcoincharts.com use nginx. I have been hammering that site and got a 'bad gateway' reponse from nginx. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:26:02
cool. Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:15:39
Its not open? Can you try again and let me know? Thanks
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:01:05
Hey, OP!
After reading the comments here Im wondering: Has your retardation cleared up yet?
@_date: 2013-03-12 14:28:07
Could still be an issue with the blockchain,... I to am having some issues with 'missing' coins. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:39:28
amen to that MasterEnt
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:47:28
Well gosh darn,.. I guess my coffee hasnt kicked in yet. 
You are right; there is no TD option. No matter. It works the same for the other banks. Just go get the hard cash at your TD branch, then go to one of the other banks to transfer the money into the cavirtex account. 


Right above the drop down where you select your deposit method, you'll see text 
that says 
"Your VirtEx account number with us is:"
Just below is your account number. 
Edit: Also change step 4 (Write down or print out cavirtex's TD bank account number. ) to reflect the bank you'll use to deposit. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:44:23


cavirtex.com lets you set up notifications and auto orders. I havent used it much, but the functionality is there. . . Not sure about other exchanges. 
You could also write a script to work with an exchange's API. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:37:31
wow. You'd think with the typically non-food like quality of our american 'cheese' the gov would be paying people to import the real thing.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:58:18
Hmmm... I was assuming that you were installing for the first time. 
Either way you should totally back up your wallet.dat manually. Im not sure if the client is designed to automagically recognize and keep an existing wallet file around when reinstalling/upgrading. . . I would not risk it. Always back up your wallet.dat. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 14:42:00
Not sure, but I just read that one of the exchanges (btc-e) is redownloading the blockchain and will be back into BTC trading when done. All coins that are missing should be back into their proper wallets. 
Im guessing your situation may be simmilar. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 17:16:34
Actually, I just got my coins back!!!!
Chack you btc-e account again!
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:25:37
Why can't you log in? Not sure, but btc-e often gets DDOS'd, keep trying. Once you are in send a msg to support to whitelist you ip.
How long for BTC to transfer? Ive waited an hour or more. Their confirmations seem to lag a bit; I was waiting for a transfer yesterday, nothing for an hour, no confirms, then 6 confirms and the btc are in my account in a matter of seconds. It can be slow but Ive never had a problem with loss. . . Also, I find LTC transfers in and out WAY quicker. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:23:09


lol. I cant say. It will deffinatly drop, and rise and drop again and then hopefully rise. If I had a solid answer to this question I'd be typing this response from my private G6 at about 30 000ft, but alas, I am typing this from my lowley office desk. That being said, Ive got some money in BTC and will probably be in it for the long term. 


Not really sure, I hear that they may have been DDOS'd earlier today. I have also heard that they went down while upgrading their system (somthing about peoples account numbers changing).  Also, I think there is alot of growing interest in BTC (and other cryptos in general), more and more people are comming to gox to trade, causing lag. 
Hope that helps,
A random stranger on the internet whos advice should be carefully scrutinized. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:44:47
Yes, I do.... But thats MY opinion... largely cuz I bought a bunch when they were around .30 USD. Now they are trading at about $5 on btc-e. 
I also bought more at around 4 bucks. 
Maybe it's a good investment for you too, Im not really qualified to say... However I am qualified to echo the advice most people give here: Dont spend more $ on crypto than you can afford to throw away. 
Good Luck!
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:41:00
I got mine all back... after a few hours of brick pooping.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:59:38
Yes. Just make sure the last 2 digits of your deposit are the same as your account number. 
if your account number is 1234567
your deposit amount: xxx6.7
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:20:37
Yes. There is a need for more exchanges. You should create one to rival gox. 
Also, we could alaways use more charts and the like. Ive been using bitcoinity.org/markets recently but am alaways looking around for something new. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:23:39
No problem. Im sure it will work out. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:50:30
No Prbs!
Im gonna say that point  is your issue. There was a major update in the last few weeks (remember the forked blockchain thing?).
Go and download the freshest copy of the client. That should work for you. 
Also, be prepared to let the client synch for up to 30some hours before you can use it (or download the blockchain via torrent and you can synch a little faster).
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:45:26


Why should reddit not be involved?


What does this matter?


Are you? What do the REGULATORS have to say about bitcoin? Besides that they are aware of it, and you need to pay tax on earnings?
I cant tell if you are trolling or not, your questions hurt my brain. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:54:40
So, do I have to claim intrest gains on crypto that I have sitting on blockchains and increasing in value, or do I only pay interest gains when I cash out?
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:35:33
Hmmm.... I wonder if this would make folks more interested in trading LTC for drugs and hookers,... LTC is cheaper and possibly easier for people to spend.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:41:01
Im running the same thing. osx10.7 bitcoin-qt and I dont have problems. 
1. Are you running the latest version?
2. Are you using a user account on the machiene or do you have ~~root~~ admin privs?
3. What do you mean by 'crash'? Is OSX reporting a crash and needs to shut the program down, or is it just 'hanging' forever, not doing anything?
@_date: 2013-03-12 17:15:49
Yep. Im waiting too. The dev will post updates in the english shoutbox on the 'trade' page. I think I saw em mention that they were waiting for 500 more to go. . . 
Here's hoping our coins come back!
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:04:43
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:06:07


Buy them, unless you have lots of money for ASIC rigs and electricity. 


make sure you read-up on and understand what a bitcoin is. Understand how to secure your coins from theft and/or loss. Also understand that any money you have in crypto today may be worth millions in the future, or possibly nothing. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:47:44


Thanks for pointing this out. Very import stuff here.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:23:42
This. Ive had this happen to me on cavirtex too. 
Can you check your 'actions' page and confirm that you coin actually did sell or if it is still in escrow?
Im concerned because I use virtex everyday. Id like to hear the end of this.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:48:48
If we all give one downvote, soon they will add up!
