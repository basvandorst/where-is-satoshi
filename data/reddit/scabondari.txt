Agreed coding is the best skill for making money nowadays. I'll be graduating from B. Eng (Computer) soon but really for a job I'm going to be doing some coding that someone could teach themselves if they're determined

Or is it just the single biggest issue in crpyto right now? High BTC  fees and the Ethereum network being overburdened seem important enough to keep bringing up. You seem like the type to sit in the kitchen drinking tea while the house burns down. Some of us would like to discuss it

Well the countries that embrace crypto will see considerable investment flow into the country as well as job creation from new businesses so the less corrupt countries that actually care about that stuff won't ban it

Bitcoin is also too expensive for them to use day to day ...

I don't see it. I see them promoting their own project as an alternative but not attempting to mislead anyone. Anyways I'd say increasing the block size is a lot closer to the original vision than the overly complex LN. 
So really the 'true Bitcoin' is a meaningless statement now. There's two competing projects so just get over it.
And if the one you're backing isn't doing so hot it might not be productive to go pointing fingers at the other. Look to within for positive change. 
Sounds like your just being whinny saying BCH shouldn't be allowed to promote their own project. If they think their version is closer to the real vision maybe it is. Prove that it's not by further your own project instead of whinning

In what way exactly are they trying to trick people into confusing the two projects? The difference seems as clear as day to me
