And banks have nothing to do with money? Fish have nothing to do with water? Plastic has nothing to do with oil?
Come on, man. Just the associations means they have something to do with each other. Maybe that wanes in the future, but pretending it's not there is just silly.

7.4 MW, and little more than a watered down test of *some* of the technology required to run a LFTR. That and a few reactors that you admit are "in production". 
You have a really odd definition of "works today", because I think most people's definition would include something about being operational right now. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:07:24
If your definition of working includes zero reactors at a production level and little more than in the design or early construction stage, then sure, LFTRs "work today".

I'm glad you do. I want to keep eating shit that had a face once.
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:18:03
Yeah, but it was first. It's like saying that tulip bulbs have nothing to do with capitalism. It's part of the early history of Bitcoin and to pretend that it isn't is childish. 
Don't change the goalposts. You said it had nothing to do with Bitcoin, which is so clearly does. Now you want to say it's not appropriate to use to criticize Bitcoin. Stand by your words or admit that you didn't word that very well and you meant something different.

They really are like a modern day Blockbuster. They make it hard to cancel or charge your card early and suddenly that $1.95 free trial turns into two months of subscription that you never wanted.

I get about .00078/day. I don't think I'll be running them once summer rolls around.

Wouldn't it be better to get them to accept bitcoin for chips?
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:03:15
OK, I did some mining last year and I have some BTC, but I've never conducted a transaction. If you want to throw me a few pennies to get my feet wet; I'm not going to say no.

I was thinking of firing up my 24 ASICs because it's getting cold out and my office gets a little chilly.

I think the big different is that torrents never threatened the governments of the world. I think a closer analogy would be to torrents + wikileaks. We saw how they responded to that.

Looks like my 24 ASICMiner Sapphires are about to be put out to pasture. It's 79F out right now; I certainly don't need the spot heater that has been justifying their continued use.

Since you have extra storage space and you wear it around your neck, you should put digital copies of any important paperwork on there. DD-214, birth certificate, marriage license, drivers license, etc. 
It could come in handy if you find yourself in a natural disaster or something worse.

I like that idea more than all the posts about charities now accepting bitcoin. I'm sick enough of those that I'm considering unsubing.

The cancelling maybe, but they still charge your account a couple of different times during your first month. I signed up for one this summer and was charged for my second month 11 days into my first month. They tried to charge me on the 2nd day of the second month, but my credit card had just expired so it couldn't go through.
All attempts to get that second month reimbursed failed so I had to resort to challenging the charge with my bank. Huge pain in the ass on my part due to shady practices on theirs. I'm sick of them complaining about people not being willing to pay. It's not that, it's that were not willing to get ripped off.

I didn't realize there was that big of a difference. I've stopped paying attention to the hardware/mining side some time ago.

I'm pretty sure the US could do that without even trying. 5 of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world are under the direct control of the US government.

Need and desire are two different things. Besides, they are going to bundle them with other services or hardware. E-mail didn't kill the Post Office, the Internet didn't kill magazines, the Kindle didn't kill books.
I understand everyone's enthusiasm about the game-changing nature of Bitcoin, but it isn't going to change human nature. Some people are always going to want to avoid certain parts of running a business and they want someone else to be accountable for them. That peace of mind or saved time is worth the price to them.

You need to run a special program, not a special operating system. Two very different creatures.

Think of what bitcoin might be worth in five years and consider your future self having access to that money for a little effort past self made five years earlier. What about 10? 20? Are you going to tell your grandkids that you gave up mining because you were only getting 1000 microBTC year?
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:49:04
I was wondering where the difficulty posts were, my bfgminer has been showing 707M for over a day now.

That won't help you from a writing-style analysis. There's some amazing work out there using compression to 'boil down' a writing style to allow a certain confidence interval between separate accounts and single ownership.

I was coming from the perspective of someone who already had purchased mining gear but didn't think it was worth it to run it anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:11:02
There is also a long lead time for a lot of the mining hardware. People are getting rigs that they bought a year ago so even if the price does go down and purchases slow, there is a backlog of hardware waiting to be delivered.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:32:03
My point exactly. In addition, they will become harder to spend in fancy restaurants and furniture stores and the like. You can try to quietly spend your bitcoin, untaxed, over the rest of your life but you are betting against the increase in computing power and pattern recognition over said lifetime.
Like everything else ever invented or discovered, there is a way to keep track of what "they" care about. They don't care about someone flipping some gold or bitcoin for a couple of grand, they do care about a couple of hundred grand.

How did the police even find out about him? He was selling bitcoins for cash in a McDonalds or something. How did they get from the original theft to an anonymous cash transaction to a bank account?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:43:11
What proof do they have that you actually completed the transaction? How do they know you didn't use a mock-up or something?
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:47:55
Of course they will. Look at other business activities that are farmed out. Many companies are perfectly able to handle their own payroll, but they hire a company to do it for them. Why? There are ever-changing laws involving commerce that have to be accounted for. There are end-users who need customer service. Many companies, especially the small ones, would prefer to spend their energy focused on their products/services and not on the mundane aspects of the business, even if it costs them more money than doing it in house.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:47:10
How much more is coming online though? How many manufacturers are using their own rigs to mine before delivery? I wonder if they don't just take the first few months of low-hanging fruit and *then* ship out their product. This would mean that these deliveries aren't increasing the network speed, just transferring who gets to do the mining.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:09:43
Yeah, I was getting ~$0.09/day with my Erupters on yesterday's difficulty. I'll be running mine throughout the winter instead of kicking on a space heater. I'm sure by the time I turn my heat off in about five months I won't even be covering electricity.

Be prepared to pay the price. Why I love Ali. He did his time for what he believed in instead of running to Canada. I would; however, add that I'd rather owe money to the mob than the IRS.

I often wonder about the large stores that early adopters have. Satoshi could easily have 5% of all bitcoins that will ever exist. As the price continues to go up, that gives him a tremendous amount of power.
I don't think you'll ever see bitcoin become a store of large amounts of wealth (i.e. 1BTC = $1M) until those early coins are spread around. It would be too easy for manipulation to destroy the value.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:00:42
They (Au, Ag) are also quite easy to trade in a cash-only fashion. You can easily cash out locally, on demand, without ever paying taxes on your gains and little way for the government to know. You'd either have to blabber about it or live a lifestyle way beyond your means to draw attention.
I agree that they won't end taxes but I do think they will provide an avenue to avoid them while still retaining the option of claiming losses on tax returns. Bitcoin has portability as an advantage while things like precious metals have ultimate physical fungibility. You can melt them down and start from scratch.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:55:38
That, I think, is the most solid angle to take. Do they have a public schedule for how long they do a burn-in?

It's Oregon; weed is a medium of exchange here. Asking if you can buy pot with bitcoin in Oregon is like asking if you can buy Yen with USD.

Bitcoins are very trackable and will only become more so as everyday usage becomes common. Think about the government having the serial number of every dollar exchanged along with other meta-data like location, time, and amount. Add that to phone location data and previously established individual travel patterns and you will very quickly have a nice little picture of who is spending what.
I'm not entirely convinced that bitcoin won't be this decade's equivalent of cell phones. That is, a very convenient tool that ultimately serves as a ridiculously effective tracking device.
Sure, that doesn't mean that people can't go to extreme measures to ensure privacy, but that'll be a handful of paranoids and professionals.

If you are bullish on the price, I don't see much reason to consider power to be the limiting factor. I have 24 erupters running now and I like the spot heat. I won't consider shutting them off until Spring and just might keep running them until the following Spring, or the one after that.
I think for me, hassle and heat will be the determining factor and it's pretty hassle free at this point.

I would say one of the keys; go to a dive bar on a weekend late night. You'll notice that if violence is the last resort of politics, then some people's politics see their end game much sooner than others.
Profit is huge, I have to concede that. But I'm a 43 year-old who got called out for a fight over a disagreement on the relative merits of halal/kosher food (in quasi-redneck territory). This was two months ago and he wanted to brawl.
People want to fight. Some of those who want to fight are really good at it. Profit isn't the only driver, it's just a tool to them.

If you have electric heat, you might as well keep it running as a space heater until spring. Right now you should be getting 143uBTC/day.
