TL;DR - guy uses a lot of unnecessary, evasive language to confuse TSA employees, is carrying a backpack full of hundreds of lapel pins (why wouldn't you just check that shit?), TSA is suspicious.

Brian Morgenstern seems to have been a manager at a Circuit City for many years, before receiving a 2 year degree in criminal justice from Rutgers, then having an internship and kind of maybe working for ING for like 6 months. Yep, seems totally qualified to initiate these kinds of proceedings to me.

Nah, I'd step into the opt-out line, but I see no reason to be a dick throughout the process. I'm all about getting through with minimum hassle to myself. I suppose the point where I'd draw the line is being asked for credentials to log into my laptop (fat chance of that happening), but I keep a guest account that can't do anything with it around for just that reason.

I've tested this with readpreference set to primaries only and still found that it overcounts when it's migrating data

This is impossible, as there is no known technology for using a published cryptographic key to verify a signature.
