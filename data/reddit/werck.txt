**How to redeem my BCC?**
BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys,
which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your
Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide
to use.
Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.

I'm "storing" the 6-6 words on two different papers, in two different places. I'm pretty sure it's still not even near the safest solution, but it will do for a while.

About Electrum Cash
The name "Electrum" has been visible on bitcoincash.org and
electrumcash.org, with a modified version of our logo. The use of our
name and logo constitutes a trademark infringement.
We have never enforced our trademark against altcoin versions of
Electrum (such as Litecoin, etc), because we consider that users of
these altcoins are well aware of the distinction between Bitcoin and
their coin, and that they cannot be harmed by that confusion. However,
we do not agree with the use of the Electrum name in the context of a
Bitcoin fork, because it suggests that we endorse that fork, and that
we also endorse that wallet.
We reserve ourselves the right to use the name Electrum for a Bitcoin
Cash wallet, should we decide to publish one in the future."

Thanks for the detailed answer and the advice about using this forum! 
I'm going to use Electrum as you and other members suggested.

Thank you! This one looks like the safest solution. I'm going to set this up if I ever buy some new coins.

You might find [this]( helpful. 
I would set up an [Electrum wallet]( if I were you.

Thank you for the links I will definitely check them out!

Thank you for the suggestions!
I'm going to set up an Electrum wallet for now, but I might buy a hardware wallet if things get serious :)

Thanks for the links! Looks like Coinbase really is awful!
Luckily, I was able to transfer my funds to my newly created Electrum wallet. 
I think I'm going to delete my Coinbase account. Looks like they are shady as hell. The only thing I'm worried about now is my identity card and credit card information. I should have asked someone before registering to that website.

No. You don't control your own private and public keys, therefore you won't be able to claim the altcoins.

Is hittng ~2300 possible? What do you think?
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:20:29
Well yeah, that's true, but firstly, I'll have to get hold of a computer with a freshly installed system and no internet connection! :)

Sorry for the dumb question, I'm new: am I safe if I transfer my bitcoins from Coinbase to a Blockchain.info wallet?
