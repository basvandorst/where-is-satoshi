A scaling solution doesnt need a benefactor - the public will demand it and it will be profitable for someone to create/provide it. Ocean plastics on the other hand, do need a benefactor. I'd much rather see the Pineapple fund consider the Pacific Garbage Patch.

1) From what I remember, Bitcoin QT will spend from the wallet without the blockchain being fully synced.
2) The wallet.dat file is the part with the addresses and private keys. Use the export feature to get a .json file that has your keys in plain text. (be sure to keep this file safe) You can then import private keys into mycelium.

I too have been mining and trading a lot through the years, not realizing the complexity of captial gains tax accounting. Basically once I read about the wash sale rules for short term capital gains, i realized my trading history would be very complex to compute.
The post says 'your tax software' will figure out short term captial gains. Anyone have leads on this? Especially for mtgox logs in csv format.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:16:10
The way you phrase it matters. Focus on the sale and work backwards from there.
You sold half a coin for $5. What did you buy that half a coin for? $2.50. You realized $2.50 in capital gains.

The issue of looking for the txid is bogus even without maleable transactions. Determining when a transaction will hit the blockchain is impossible and may be never. Once a transaction is issued, its impossible to reliably revoke. The solution is to move the bitcoins to a new address, making the old transaction irrelevant, then issue a new withdrawal from that address to the customer. Thats in addition to tracking all payouts to detect maleable transactions.

A raffle/lottery is interesting way to describe this difference in mining a block. The number of players does not affect your chance of winning *in a single number pick*.
What does change with the number of players is the time available to find that winning number. Each player has a ticket-generating machine. A single miner is competing against the hashrate of the whole network. The higher the network's hashrate, the quicker the opportunity space is covered which means less time for a single miner to find the winner.

Woah now, this is the chart you want to be looking at, percent of transaction volume going to fees:
The chart linked in the headline shows total fees per block, which says nothing about the per transaction fee.

the minimum tx fee is 'whatever a miner will accept' to process your tx. So its potentially highly dynamic.
 is an excellent site that watches the mempool and monitors what people are actually paying to get into the blockchain.

"The 21 Bitcoin Chip has an efficiency of approximately 0.16 Joules per Gigahash and arrives configured to calculate at a rate of approximately 50 Gigahashes per second."
By putting 50 GH/s into  you get 0.00012825 BTC/$0.08USD per day. Note the 21.co computer would never 'win' a block by itself - it contributes hashes to a 21.co controlled mining pool in return for a tiny stream of btc. I have no idea what the rate of the actual stream of btc is. If some 21.co owner knows, please step up!
Its a very interesting project. The mining pool raises just a bit of a red flag since it demands a level of trust in 21.co. I imagine there is various trickery possible in adjusting the mining output for various reasons.

Its simple to disprove, if the IRS says it was a sale, where is the cash? There isnt any cash involved in the transfer.
Keep calm and report BTC when actual tax events occur, just like normal. Its unfortunate that coinbase is misrepresenting transfers, but it doesnt change the law.

Using the most efficient miner in a random blog post of miners, The Dragonmint T16 miner: 0.075J/GH times the current hashrate 83526953TH/sec =  6.2Gigawatts.

SegWit creates segwit transactions, segwit addresses, and requires servers and wallets across the entire ecosystem to upgrade to support it. Because segwit transactions are listed as anyone-can-spend to non-segwit clients, near 100% cooperation is necessary. Even the secondary benefits of fixing malleable transactions is only for segwit style transactions. Its overly complicated and after multiple years of stalemate, the issue is finally coming to the boiling point.
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:53:12
This is taken from a pro-segwit page 
To see where segwit would lead bitcoin, just try and follow along with this.
"Overall, the changes that segwit makes do maintain compatibility with non-upgraded nodes. With these changes, a non-upgraded user can send Bitcoin using the current output types, thus able to send to both upgraded and non-upgraded users. Because the transaction uses the current output types, the following transaction cannot take advantage of segwit. However, a non-upgraded user can send to a segwit output nested in a p2sh output which allows them to send to upgraded users who can then take advantage of segwit for the following transaction. Upgraded users can also spend from any of the output types and still create the current output types so they can send to non-upgraded users as well."
Here is another section that tries to say in other terms that segwit transactions are listed as anyone-can-spend, without actually saying that.
"Myth: If I don’t upgrade, I can be attacked by people sending me transactions with segwit outputs
If you don’t upgrade, your wallet will not know of the segwit outputs. It will not know that these outputs are meant for you. This can of course create problems if an upgraded user decides to create a segwit output when sending to a non-upgraded user. The non-upgraded user will not recognize the transaction is for him and this can create disputes. Unfortunately this flaw cannot be fixed through the consensus rules but rather through software implementation. For this, the best thing to do is for software to not use the segwit output types at all but rather continue to use the currently used p2pkh, p2sh, and p2pk output types. "
"...*not to use segwit outputs*.." does not sound like a rollback is easy, or possible, does it?

This part of the analogy falls down. Tether does say exactly that they will redeem USDT for USD.
"Absent a reasonable legal justification not to redeem Tether Tokens, and provided that you are a fully verified customer of Tether, your Tether Tokens are freely redeemable."
I think we agree that USDT is a timebomb and people would be well advised to avoid holding USDT. My guess is that the Tether organization is holding up their end of the bargain. Its amazing that USDT has operated so well for so long. 
Here's an interestig tidbit from that same page.
"Beginning on January 1, 2018, Tether Tokens will no longer be issued to U.S. Persons."
A number of exchanges are US-Based such as Poloniex, and rely heavily on USDT. I wonder how they operate under these terms.

"We cant use two horses, noone would buy a double-wide buggy. Instead we'll put half a horse directly in front of the first horse, unless 80% of the passengers are Amish then the Witness Horse can be 100% of the original horse times the segwit factor of course and we can only pull into segwit carriage houses. We added blinders too (malleability fix), which anyone can do but some attribute it to segwit."

I wonder about that, too. BTC-E operates in Romania and/or surrounding countries (there is little info on that). I imagine there are major impediments to moving US Dollars in to/out of the exchange. Cryptsy (in Florida, USA) is also, at times, significantly 'away' from the other exchanges.

In a profitable example, buy at $100 and sell at $125, timing starts to matter. Due to the Wash Sale rule you'll be taxed on the $25 profit even if you buy coins again with the proceeds - if the buy happens over 30 days later. 
In that case you dont really have $125 to spend. You have $107.75 because $12.50 should have gone to uncle sam (using an example 10% short term caiptal gains rate)
This is based on my own research and I'm not a tax professional. It seems like an accounting nightmare if many trades of different amounts were involved over the course of a year. I'm working on an algorithm to try and calculate which short term trades get the wash sale treatment.

I thought about this too, but it violates the basic premise of arbitrage. The idea that one currency is 'safe' and another currency is volatile. Wait for a spread between two markets and limit your exposure by being in the volatile currency just long enough to do the trade. By keeping a pile of coins on an exchange, thats continual exposure to btc price changes which is the very thing arbitrage tries to avoid.
