Nice referral links, leach

Why not utilize the vault? It's insured

What would it take to get a BTC stock split going? 
1:1000? BTC is now worth $4.50!
Let's do it guys.

Let's meme this bitch up

BTC SV is best!

Ah yes, the (((financially system)))

Hopefully we'll create more alt coins and give me more "free money" again.

Have you seen their country? They gave up a long time ago...

We use CNN to refer to mendacity now. Get with the times.

What is "real backing?" Does the USD have "real backing?" 
The stock market is backed by the assets and hope of future earnings of companies? What keeps the stock market from having a runaway chain reaction where people get nervous and sell everything off? 
Nothing, right? That shit happened in 2009. 
But yea, absolutely, BTC could boom and bust - but so can any other asset or currency.

He failed out of BUDs, is that what you're talking about

Come on over to Literally thousands of like-minded individuals. They're a little angsty about crypto these days though, long story...
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:43:15
These people are just searching now. They haven't even tried to buy yet. 
This means bubble is in a week or two. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:12:53
He's not. 
He failed out of seal training, that's it.

Do you feel a little pissy about ETH gains right now? I know I do. 
They feel the same way. They did things "right," and there are people who took a risk, didn't work hard or anything and are running circles around their plans. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:56:46
I don't care what the cats heard!

Doesn't feel like real life. Segwit has been a white whale for what, two years now?

You're assuming he doesn't want to eat his d on national t. 
Remember who we're talking about here.

He would "owe" it, but they would never find out.

I'm finally convinced investing in BTC and ETH is completely and absolutely different.
BTC is like digital gold and ETH is like stock in a tech startup (that's not to say it won't be succesful, it might be) but it is NOTHING like BTC.
If you doubt what I'm saying read this tweet thread involving Vitalik, Nick Szabo and many others. 
It seems ETH will end not being actually a blockchain but another kind of pseudo-decentralized processing system.

How are you mining 
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:40:16
This could in fact be a bubble, in retrospective 
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:01:23
Truly a visionary 
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:31:33
People don't just buy coffee with gold. It's just crappy speculative asset.
