.. get out
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:20:53
So am I
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:21:19
He probably is tbh. And thats the sad part.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:02:27
As long as they do their own thing and dont pretend to be bitcoin there is no problem with this
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:07:08
Dont let yourself get annoyed by it
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:10:19
It's a real issue. Crypto enthusiasts will still use crypto though. Let's hope that one day crypto become mass adopted and gets a stable price but for that to ever happen, there needs to be early adopters.
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:24:39
Not really. We're in a correction and it could very well go down further. But if you are gonna sell, you better buy back more at a lower price.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:29:00
I've never had any problems on Windows 10 so probably a linux thing.
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:33:47
Its not spam if its legit
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:35:45
Nah spend it and use it as a currency as it was intended
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:33:18
Yes it is
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:01:25
I see more people complaining about people not getting the joke than people who don't get the joke
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:50:48
What exactly is this? Will my bitcoin automatically get converted to segwit2X or is it a new seperate currency?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:34
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:22
You're saying that when its on its way up again?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:12
Uh ok? Did I loose btc?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:52:34
Price in early 2017: ~1000$
Price now: ~14 000$
Also, most of the growth this year happened in the last month.
Yeah nothing is happening.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:28:36
Because he didnt know he was rich yet..?
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:32:05
Nope. You just create a new bitcoin account. You don't create a new seed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:02
Once bitcoin gets the upgrade, theres no reason to use BCH
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:04:19
Really? From what I've seen it should take about 3 days. But some wallets will constantly rebroadcast the transaction and that could cause it to be stuck for ever.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:20
You will win from this. Just be patient
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:58:03
Wait a couple of days, its either gonna go trough or the network will forget it and you get it back.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:59
I got 0.000002 btc.. I had bitcoin before but I sold those.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:27:57
Hmm.. Why are people even taking it seriously?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:11
And then you got me who just panicked and did nothing. I neither lost nor won.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:29
It drops, then comes back stronger like it always does
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:45:38
Aight. So it will be automatic as long as your wallet supports it right? No hassle for us?
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:25:37
Is segwit2x developed by the same people as segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:34
Seems like its already over. Damn I missed it.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:16:27
How are you not addressing the porn thing?
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:26:31
The market goes up and down all the time. Whats so special? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:41
Yeah cancer is too soft. Get burned alive is better.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:16:18
I just hate the idea of splitting bitcoin into several currencies
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:11:48
Wait, you can actually send 0.01 sat? What happens when you try to send that to the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-09-01 18:57:42
Oh my
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:29
Going to sleep. Not sure what to expext tomorrow when I wake up
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:23:55
Its a joke
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:13:26
Rip :(
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:32:09
Its not easy, you just got lucky. It could have gone the other way
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:38:46
Nah fuck Bcash. But even tho the mempool is almost empty, I still thought segwit would be more used as its used by most wallets and exchanges
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:11:19
Passport? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:52:05
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:50:46
And religious people say the same about atheist but there's no doubt who's right.
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:46:17
Well, I guess you just gotta trust that Coinbase got good security. I almost trust them more than myself tough. Having to keep your private keys on your own device can be risky too. 
And im not sure why they don't list it. It's weird since coinbase is one of the biggest exchanges.
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:48:27
Thats true. It's also worth noting that GDAX is changing its name to Coinbase pro.
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:23:25
Or just use satoshis
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:45:08
I never tought coinbase had high fees, but I guess compared to other exchanges it might.
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:32:13
I bet you're Roger
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:34:05
I guess I did then. I'll just blame it on "my english isnt the best"
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:52:58
Buy more? Or did I miss a joke here? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:52:18
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:09:40
Bcash are systematically attacking and hurting bitcoin. Let's not ignore that.
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:25:01
I would love to set up a node myself. You can do this using a raspberry pi right? Could anyone link me to a good guide on how to set it up?
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:04:07
Yeah the one on the painting is wrong, his actual adress is 357dmbAEipaPLTAeKBq1bs1ZMmBZ8PLMRN :)
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:19:16
Earth is round? I disagree.
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:39:36
Because this guy is fooling thousands. We have to do our best to inform people and stop his BS.
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:54:52
Just report the channel.

While the number of miners will increase, GPU's will continue to become more and more power efficient. Also, we will produce more and more energy as solar panels become more efficient. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:12:37
Even if it's not roger whoever runs it is still a fucking idiot
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:36:49
Any of the options on there should be safe. [Bitcoin.org]( wouldn't list any non\-safe options. I personally use coinbase as it's very simple and user friendly and has a good wallet, but I know a lot of people don't like coinbase because of various reasons. Just do some research on what people like and don't like.
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:50:01
I know right? Bcashers are some of the most childish people I've come across.
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:09:48
That is so stupid.. Yeah we should've just let hitler do what he wanted and let him do what he thought was right.
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:16:24
supports Bcash and not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:49:49
I wouldn't be surprised if theres a big bullrun coming, now with all this attention.
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:57:39
What's with these coins having weird ass names? I don't see "Pivx coin" ever catching on because of the name alone.
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:54:44
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:57:45
Yeah, that's definitely not very user friendly..
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:13:43
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:56:43
It's funny cause I never thought I would find one of these guys in the wild, but I did. This was on video completely unrelated to bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. 
This was the video: 
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:42:44
Opera is really good. It got a built-in password manager, VPN and adblock.
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:50:16
I've never used Bisq, but I've seen other people recommend it so it's probably good.
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:42:01
But isn't segwit the default option in wallets? It has been in the wallet's I've tried, including coinbase which is the biggest bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:22:23
Sure thing
Also, just the fact that he says Bcash is bitcoin is a scam
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:05:46
Not even I can solve captchas so it'll take a while before bots can
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:27:10
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:47:28
You could always buy BTC on coinbase than transfer them to another wallet like Samourai. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:20:38
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:14:23
I know this is an unpopular opinion, but now that coinbase support segwits, its not a bad option.
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:58:31
HE DOESNT USE SEGWIT?! *TRIGGERED*
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:33:27
We'll just say that BPC is the real Bcash beacuse our coin is what Roger envisioned Bcash to be.
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:32:06
Seeing Bcash supporters on twitter is just ridiculus. They seem to have no life as they sit there and bash on bitcoin, the lightning network and segwit 24/7
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:03:10
Its gonna be hard to get stable above 10k. Its such a "special" number and so many bots are set to sell at that price.
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:11:26
I mean he is a fraudster and he's known so the statement is pretty correct.
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:44:09
The religious obviously /s
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:49:59
Oh really? I'm sorry for saying misinformation then. But isn't coinbase also international tho? I know it's available in Norway at least, in fact my bank has coinbase integrated in their mobile app.
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:24:29
No btc is not controlled by banks in any way. Bitcoin can and is functioning 100% without any banks. Blow up every bank in the world and btc would still be up and running.
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:37:30
When was satoshi last seen?
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:03:22
If this is real, than that's really cool. Congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:03
Im just confused. Im not complaining about free money but wtf
@_date: 2019-03-21 22:16:18
Yeah, what are the chances that a r/bitcoin user would get such a coin.
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:06:21
I hope its the next avengers
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:47:19
There probably werent gonna be much leftover anyways as she used it all on.. you know
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:12:45
The lows are getting higher tho
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:03:22
Uhh I also made a node
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:32:44
I guess I'm asking what is considered my many to be a good block explorer
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:22:16
Then the supply increases and the price decreases
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:43:57
Lol idiot. Satoshi is my uncle and he's definitely not Swedish.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:14:54
There will never be 21m coins in circulation, because of lost coins and hodlers. If lost coins would get found again it wouldn't do anything, imagine finding a lost 100$ bill, that wont change the market, you'll just be a little richer.
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:48:43
Isnt that pretty risky?
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:35:03
You copy the bitcoin blockchain and alters the rules. This would basically create a new cryptocurrency and would be incompatible with bitcoin. Anyone can do this and there have been a couple of forks already, like bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:09:42
Couldn't you say that the mempool is a part of the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:55:42
This could be huge for crypto. If they would do this, it might not be too far\-fetched for them to accept crypto as payment on amazon? I hope this is real
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:23:38
They should've said that a lot more than 7tx/s is possible using the LN and segwit. Lot's of people are gonna see it and be like "Wtf it can only do 7tx/s? What a joke"
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:05:57
You can only estimate. There is no way to know.
And the value of bitcoin just depends on supply and demand, lost bitcoin will make the supply lower and therefore make the price a bit higher.
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:54:51
I've seen people be against the LN? Why is this? Cause to me the LN seems great
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:38:49
That too
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:12:41
And why is it being upvoted?
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:01:48
Depends on how much your electrisity cost
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:15:59
Good luck shutting down all nodes and miners ;)
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:54:08
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:24:21
Lol I see
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:43:31
This is a really good point and I'd like to see how a Bcash supporter would defend this.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:36:52
Except bitcoin also went down
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:36:15
Ok wtf
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:01:06
I don't know what cash app is but I know coinbase is a popular place for new people to start trading BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:00:22
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:30:13
That would require a hard fork
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:57:26
Its a joke
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:35:11
Downvotes are probably from anti-segwit/ln people
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:32:52
This type of falure could happen to any of those you listed tho
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:49:13
I think it's kinda weird. It is a decent wallet/exchange in my opinion. Only thing I don't like is that they don't give you access to the private keys.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:04:17
With segwit and LN on the rise, i would asume fees will never get that high again?
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:20:25
They wouldn't be able to mine enough to make a difference
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:34:22
It was out on [bitcoin.org]( earlier today but then it got removed. I posted about it 50 minutes ago here on the subreddit.
Edit: Lol so apparently my post got deleted because it's a duplicate of this post even tough my post came first. But I guess your post is a little better with a more information so its not a bad thing.
Edit2: Also why is this getting downvotes?
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:28:31
Its like anything that has value
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:38:28
Same, that's why I said " I want a good alternative to blockchain.info "
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:09:55
Thats kinda genius
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:07:00
I mean if a seccond layer literally just makes it better than give me it
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:48:15
:) 
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:14:38
I suppose you're right. But I still wanna argue that BTC has advantages in being decentralized
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:28:40
You lose time. And time is money.
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:04:43
Well use a offline wallet and you're good. Also there are many currencies in europe, not just euros.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:42:34
It's currently not suitable for everyday payments, but isn't the goal that one day it will me?
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:40:15
If you want untraceable money use cash
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:41:32
Absolute unit
@_date: 2019-06-15 21:15:53
This and also we just hit a new all time high hashrate? Thats gotta be good news
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:30:32
I think your thinking is correct
@_date: 2019-06-14 01:34:50
That thing that says it is bitcoin but also says its better than bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:27:14
He just replied to you, retard
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:41:18
Pretty sure they would use satoshis instead of saying "0.000000031 btc"
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:16:48
What logic is that? It's up 200% regardless if you bought it or not.
@_date: 2019-02-07 09:51:36
If it included LN activity, would it make a noticable difference? Im under the impression that the vast majority does not use the LN
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:33:10
The fact that we don't know who created bitcoin is a strength and not a weakness in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-13 23:20:15
Digital gold
@_date: 2019-06-13 23:23:05
r/bitcoin will upvote anything as long as it makes bitcoin look good
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:20:41
Major event? Like a meteor hitting china?
@_date: 2019-04-21 07:15:40
Probably you
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:10:30
No idea how this guy don't get that
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:13:17
Uhm I use coinbase and it has segwit so idk what you are talking about
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:46:20
Are you an idiot? Even if I bothered logging into my coinbase right now, a photo would't prove it. I could've photoshopped it. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:46:16
I dont actually. As you can probably tell im no pro in bitcoin and crypto in general
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:20:47
Dude im telling you, coinbase got segwit a long time ago. If you refuse to believe me, google it or create your own account.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:42:10
Sold as it went down, bought at a lower price and now I got more bitcoin. Who is the moron again? 
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:44:01
Never even heard of that site. Sure its not sketchy?
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:35:02
They use tether tho?
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:02:42
I could just find any transaction on the blockchain. How can you know if its my transaction or not?
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:20:54
I tried it out. It doesnt seem like I was able to verify my "proof of residence". I dont know if I used the wrong type of document or if its not supported in Norway but I sent a support email.
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:59:23
I just realized you don't know how to spell Coinbase. You haven't spelled it correctly a single time.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:27:41
As in, if you want to trade fiat you have to do it via tether. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:35:59
Those must be edibles
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:09:21
Why is it getting upvotes? I thought this comminity was better than this.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:23:57
They're like pants but shorter legs
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:11:29
Even if they simplify topics, its still educational.
