Any publicity is good publicity.

I'd do it. Not only would it be good publicity, but as a college student, it could be rewarding.

A pirate walks into a bar, and the bartender says: "sir, why is there a steering wheel in your pants"? The pirate says: "ARGH! It's drivin' me nuts!"

Long-time lurker here.
I've been in BTC since mid-2011, and I've learned so much from the BTC community. While I haven't invested a lot of money into it, I have invested a decent (maybe too much) amount of time into learning the in's and out's of the protocol, as well as being a part of the community. I mined in the early days, and was one of the first in line to use OpenCL when it was introduced for Guiminer (sorry cg/other fans, just for convenience).
As a networking security college student, I was (am) tight on funds and always interested in emerging technologies (security-related or not). Naively, and with all the regret I can muster, I decided to keep (almost) all of my coins at MtGox. I had decided a few months ago that I would withdraw some (for spending [only a little]) and hold what I could at Gox for trading/holding (which was the large majority of my holdings). 
As I'm sure the countless others Gox account holders are feeling right now, I'm pretty scared. I just want my coins so I can hold or spend or do with them as I please. I was planning on using my BTC for my college loans, or for down payments on my post-graduation living arrangements (I graduate in May). I got so excited I left them in the exchange, and I feel like I got burned.
I guess my real question(s) is/are: 
Can someone with some experience in corporate or marketing or something of that nature really try to speculate on what is going to happen with MtGox?
Is there anything I can do to help the community of holders in my situation? (Already know of Josh Jones)
Can anyone make recommendations as to what I can do from here?
Thank you everyone for always being helpful, supportive, and as always, my information-base.

I wasn't trying to insinuate anything. I was just pasting the email I received this morning. Sorry if my title said otherwise. Mods: you're welcome to change it if you want.

I guess my questions were answered today. Thanks for the help anyway.

Woops, didn't see the original. Will leave it up for now.

So it is pretty safe to store coins there long term then? As long as all of the coins are in the multi-sig vault? It's funny you mention you forgot your password. Mine wasn't working when I tried to withdraw either. Even had it in Keepass. Could've sworn that was the right one. Ended up using my User seed as well. 
EDIT: Which brings  up another question, can I withdraw my coins (recreate the HD wallet) without my vault password? You need the shared key to create it, which is encrypted by the vault password. FAQ says there's no way to change any info about a created vault (except the name) once it's created. I guess I'm better off dumping the vault and recreating it with a known good password.
