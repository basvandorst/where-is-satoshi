Ethereum been hella slow too. The 2nd and 3rd Gen coins have way better technology. Bitcoin is only in demand because it’s so widely accepted now, it’s built a name for itself. Ethereum has a bit of a name and although i think it is going to continue to rise, it isn’t the pick for a guaranteed investment profit

And I’m saying the technology behind Ethereum is struggling under cryptocats. I don’t see much potential there either

I have too much pocket change and it makes my pants fall down because it’s heavy

I think there’s better coins but as bitcoin is still the fiat/crypto medium i think the price will continue to rise until that is no longer the case

Jesus buddy I’m just sharing an opinion on a  discussion forum, take yourself a little less seriously. 
I said my opinion is that bitcoin is also NOT the way to go. Said it pretty clearly, in fact

Because after that disgusting spike people cash out to take their profits

There’s limitations on what Ethereum can do, that’s the significant factor in my eyes, but I’m not going to sit here and argue about it

10k creates too much media attention for it to drop
