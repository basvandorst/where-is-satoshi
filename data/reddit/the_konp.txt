Carrying around more than $10k in cash in the US? You're a criminal until you prove otherwise. ---- Yep you guessed correctly: Debit Card users not affected.

Right now I wouldn't do any large transaction with bitcoins.
Think about those guy who sold their porsches I think they both lost like 10k in the deals unless they cashed out right after they sold which would pretty much defeat the purpose of doing BTC

@_date: 2013-11-07 15:21:52


because I dont like the idea of losing 100s of dollars? Remember those stories about the guys selling their porsches? after the bubble popped last time they sold a 50k car for 20k

1st printing - 2d printing
2nd priting - 3d printing
3rd printing - 4d printing
that right fourth dimension printing which allows you to bend spacetime

Isn't this the whole problem with BTC right now? They arnt an investment they are a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:10:31
Its not retarded just because it pointed out some flaws in bitcoin
bitcoins massive fluctuation is worrisome. Im not willing to spend 1 BTC on $200 of product because 1btc might be worth 300 tomorrow
With a stable price more people would actually us it as a currency rather than an investment

Why on earth would anyone give those people money?
Hey guys I want to make a documentry on how to buy a ferrari with bitcoins please send me money
@_date: 2013-07-17 19:51:56
Until bitcoins are actually easy to acquire they will not be great for starting a business. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 00:40:51
I still done understand how those two were able to sucker 70k out of people

Hey guys I'm starting a kickstarting project, trying to buy a ferrari with bitcoins. I'll need about 10k coins get on it
 
@_date: 2013-06-21 19:13:44
right OP is basically saying hey its easier to break the law with bitcoin

3rd printing begs to differ

if the price was trending upward he would still be wary of using his coins
why would I drop 10 coins on a $1,000 product when tomorrow I realize I just spent $2,000 on something worth $1,000
@_date: 2013-08-28 01:40:22
it was 73k on kickstarter. I wonder if they converted it all they may have turned 73k to 730 BTC which is now worth 95k
