I do agree with you that it is a joke that a BTC conference does not accept cryptopayments...

Don't you agree that this a great thing? Being able to have complete control over your transactions, that is what Bitcoin is all about!

Faketoshi strikes again. Even the Bitcoin Cash community starts disliking him. He is poisoning the whole crypto community!

I do actually utilize cryptocurrencies on many occasions. At least where they are accepted.
And there definitely more people out there who are contributing to the network instead of cold storing.
So no, that's a false statement.

First of all, that is your opinion, freedom of speech I guess. I do not believe in religion either but there is no reason to call it "bullshit" without any backed arguments.
Second, look at the big picture. In a matter of time you will be able to support any cause globally (whatever it is) with cryptocurrencies, without anyone interfering! Religious beliefs are only a fraction of the whole.
One step closer to global adoption.

It is more convenient to use BTC. Or you have to exchange your cash to Russian Ruble (and back if you do not spend all).
In addition, the exchange fees they take in fiat is nuts.
I would say it's a perfect opportunity to use BTC!

Elaborate please? I am talking about cryptocurrencies as a whole.
