And yet you're shitting all over people for having a difference of opinion.

I understand bitcoin has nothing to do with my database.  That's just their means of paying them.
There's a site called bitcoinabuse.com and there's 30 reports to this account over the last 3 days.  I was just wondering if something was going to happen due to those reports.  That's my question.  I guess the answer is 'no'.
edit: I decided to post here because I thought if anyone knew what would happen from bitcoinabuse.com report it might be you guys.

Which item in the community guidelines cover this? Legit question.  I did read the guidelines before postign and saw nothing that would indicate I shouldn't post  this.  You guys sure are butthurt over someone asking a legit question.

that's basically what I'm asking.  is there some value to this site other than an archive of reports. it appears the answer is no.
I live in Canada and the site is hosted in USA.  Basically, there's nothing I can do about it.  Just bummed and grasping at straws here.

That's a terrible analogy. I didn't give out any money.
@_date: 2019-04-27 10:04:25
And yet I never asked about @_date: 2019-04-29 00:59:34
And I never said it did.  If you had read the chain you'd see that I said something like "if anyone would know about bitcoin abuse report then it would be someone here".  That's why I asked.  I have no idea why a few of you have your panties all bunched up over someone asking a legit question.

bitcoin address yes.  Sorry, I'm not a follower of bitcoin so I'm not familiar with the appropriate terminology.
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:29:47
not blaming bitcoin.  bitcoin is all cool with me.  I have nothing against bitcoin or any users of it.
see my edit to the original post.
I submitted a report to bitcoinabuse.com.  All I'm asking is if something can or ever happens to the abuse reports.  That's all.  Did I just waste my time submitting the report.
