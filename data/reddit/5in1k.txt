Maybe that works in a stable country, this is Venezuela.

Trading?  I thought Bitcoin was money not a stock.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:56:45
I'm saying the infrastructure needed to use Bitcoin probably isn't there, money is useless if you can't access it and spend it.

I'm waiting until it's $800 a coin.

Hard work, too many people want to get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:20:00
Fuck this, you don't go into debt to "invest" or whatever people are calling buying Bitcoin now.  That's how you get fucked.

Hahaha, I'm sorry but until we mine asteroids for it, gold will be dominant.

I'm not praying for anything.  I'm pessimistic about bitcoin's staying power, I wouldn't buy at 800 because that means it's probably dead anyway.

You can blame old money but the downfall of Bitcoin right now is people treating it like a stock and people manipulating it pretty hardcore.

I thought it was currency not a stock market, god so many fools.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:27:28
In a market with regulations it would be.

That sounds like hippy bullshit.

Star Trek was a fictional TV show.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:16:13
Star Trek can be hippy bullshit yes.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:26:54
How about I just watch from a distance and laugh at the hodlers and never buy any Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:34:16
I doubt it.
