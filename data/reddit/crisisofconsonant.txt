yes_thats_right, yes thats right.
I'm glad you understand like so few others seem to, with investments not moving forward is the same as moving backwards (actually moving forward but slowly can be the same as moving backwards).
It's all about what level of risk you're comfortable with, but paying off the loan is a poorer investment (but greater risk) than letting it increase in bit coin value at that rate. I don't think even the mob has interest rates that out do the growth he's made in 1 month.
I am curious about one thing, can you even liquidate that many bit coins (I assume approx 1200). So say the market for bit coins starts to fall out because of crypto concerns or a competing market. Even if caught early if you have a large bit coin investment can you liquidate fast enough not to be screwed? It's not like a government or asset backed security so I assume before you can liquidate you have to find a someone to buy. Is there an automated process for that? I don't know the sums of bit coins transactions that are flying around so I don't know if that's a lot of bit coins or a trivial amount in the grand scheme of things.

I think you might be my brother... hookers &amp; blow obsessions are genetic right?

Ah, yeah I guess if they do 100 BTC's an hour liquidating 1200 is pretty easy. Of course that's susceptible to real change real quick if suddenly there are more sellers than buyers.
Personally I think this is a very unlikely scenario. I can only imaging it happening if something was found out that allowed new bit coins to be generated very quickly. I could see that basically causing hyper inflation, but then only if the technique was found out by a lot of people. Although this is an investor market basically so just a single spook can do weird things.
