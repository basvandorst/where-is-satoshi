It's up now!
That's not a bad problem to have as long as it crashed for the right reasons ;-)

As far as i understand the final software will run, you will just need to run Ethereum in the background and the Augur software will work perfectly. I have tried the Alpha and the Ethereum software is needed, but nothing else is needed to run Augur.

The affiliation with Ethereum is one of the biggest reasons I was so hungry to join the Augur team. So far both the Augur and Ethereum teams met and exceeded my expectations.

Had the pleasure of working with Jason for a while and he is a great guy who is really really smart. Awesome to see this as I love hearing him talk all things Bitcoin!

Thanks! We are in talks now.
Also, huge thanks for those recognizing the potential of Augur, it's great seeing people who saw the same thing I did.

Thanks Erik, I'm super sad I couldn't make it out there but according to Jeremy and Jack things are looking great for Augur and the Innovation Lab has only been open for a short period.

Awesome to hear! I used the handle that I traditionally use for responses regarding my podcast earlier as it was an audio related question. 
Glad to hear that excitement in so many comments, that's exactly how I felt when I joined the team and read the seemingly overwhelming amount of content that Jeremy sent me. We hope that everyone who is excited can spread the word about this video and the project.

Thanks Erik! I remember chatting with you about Augur as I was joining the team and I have to say I am more than happy I decided to join. Being a part of such a small and brilliant team has taught me so much and really forced me to learn more about a subject I was already interested in.

Regarding the Shooter question, he is heavily interested in Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech and became a great friend of mine over the past year. I knew he did a radio show on Sirius/XM and asked him to do the voiceover, he agreed and knocked it out of the park. Hearing him talk about Bitcoin on Joe Rogan's podcast and other media is always a thrill. Can't say enough good things about the guy. 
Regarding the Ethereum question, a developer can give a more eloquent technical answer. I do know that Vitalik and their team have worked with us extensively and all of us are happy to be the first app released on the platform.
