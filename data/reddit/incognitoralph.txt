Dude.... pretend to be less smarter than you are lol it's safe that way trust me. I'm guessing you haven't broken the barrier

this is why I have c4 implanted in my neck lol or the bitcoin password tattoed inside my head so that killing is the only logical way to get to it. Legit though, everything feels like everyone is working together and cooperation is awesome. But correct me if I am wrong, not every human is equivalent and not all humans possess the same knowledge as the next. Given this condition along with my predictive, analytical and financial reasoning there are more than likely lower members ready with a tactical plan to kill all the weak old rich "fat fuckers" who don't deserve any place in the evolutionary chain because of how dumb they are. Because of their massive amount of trust in their own blood, they made monsters of the world while making their fun and violent, brutal and cruel tv shows. (everyone is ultra savage nowadays, no honor code lol, if you do I applaud you, and give you an estimated less than 6 years left to live, only for your estimate sake) If you give a certain type of violently disposed people (Rh-) people money and power, and force them to soldier more violently disposed people, these people can't control their anger. So all of a sudden, the top guns decide to drop bitcoin. It isn't to revitalize the human race, or save all their loyal dogs, they want to see evolution at work, evolve this pathetic stupid fucking race and pit all of you motherfuckers against your friends, family, and people you believed you had a working relationship with. I mean, if you have a certain blood type your safe I guess... Literally kill you while you work for them is one of the most intelligent ways to fire somebody from your organization. That's how I would do it, can't leave some pathetic loyal dog who has no significance to the greater wheel other than growing old and dying or his pussy grandson who dresses in wannabe gangster clothes but has the intelligence of an angry middle schooler. Too bad greed is very powerful, and everyone else has 210 iq too? Not that any intelligent conscious animal would think to exploit that greed. Only the dumbasses will get tortured to death, everyone else will either go on the offense or join groups. I personally enjoyed the pillaging its what makes the universe the universe you know. 
I think the lack of independence from humans of all blood types is astounding. Honestly a reset button along with ET's determining a genetic pool out of the smartest of our species is the best idea, everyone is just too stupid to remain alive lol, and maybe that includes me. Your not really a slave if your leader has to hide underground or in disguises that's just weak evolution. Can't even convince stupid people that you would be an intelligent leader, that
s how fucking dumb and weak you are. Maybe this is a planet designed to make weapons. I took my BFL yesterday.
I'd much rather have 8000 5g wifi routers around me than be my enemy tbh, literally remote viewing friend-on-friend btc torture.... when I figured out how to spot the, or a target. doesn't work all the time, it looks fucking weird. 
Personally, I would bring at least one weak attacker with me so it wouldn't count as suicide my head is blown into a million pieces. My death and future bloodlines, potentially my humble contribution to evolutionary development because I'm not fucking retarded. 
I got my meds late lol

The aliens �� are going to come here like the recent movie predator and take an autistic boy who can somehow decipher alien code language, or something like that.
Or they will take our water because it's liquid, but anyways fun!

so the only two ... men in existence on youtube actually warn people about the dangers of cryptoanarchy (love the term)
I feel like many people might have a bias when entering into my fantasy citadel, but rest assured, at Golden Company our word is as good as gold. The trick is to buy the equipment that other security companies never thought about buying.

I can already say that bitcoins aren't tulips because tulips are actually, fucking flowers. Literally fucking flowers. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:11:44
that would break every alt and shitcoin in existence and we need to break every alt and shitcoin in existence to have bitcoin dominant.

cat does post well, we still need banks but the assets that are unsecured will now be super secure, while also increasing in value over time because mining increases in expense every time the blockchain halves

people who don't like an abundance of money are the same people who don't give a shit about bitcoin. Their loss. Be a builder, not a destroyer. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:09:44
or the banks already bought a fuckton of bitcoin, as instructed, and like all new wealth, wants to turn bitcoin into an asset class because of it's widespread usage. When, fiat fails, and venezuela happens, everyone will want to turn to one asset class that is not government regulated and caused. (Hint, financial collapse) Bitcoin. It's unique because of it's users, security, how it functions, etc, and it is now known well across the entire planet. (because of one bull run to 20k) Sometimes, I feel like losing all my bitcoin was not a blessing but it was a wakeup call to own a small amount of bitcoin, like 0.5? 
@_date: 2018-11-02 04:46:19
Just advancing the blockchain quickly, we don't want the dumbed down population to pick up on bitcoin. One more push to 100k and a crash should really weed out the ones who aren't confident in their decision. Remember, this is one of the greatest social engineering feats that has ever occurred in humanity and might even save our race for the future.

Just read this thing might go to 10 mirrrrriooonnnn dorras. So naturally, I got hacked when I bought it. Now I'm at 0.5 btc, and about 120k in debt from mining machines 
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:02:43
So essentially the people is their fallout. We need bitcoin and we need it soon. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:45:11
dam I'm gonna short it all with all my money, nothing to lose since I don't know whether it will go back up. I don't even know what blockchain is, screw it!

It’s not a fucking tulip and people are using mobile payments all the time these days in certain countries where cultural practices are not barbaric down to the shopping mall lesson is don’t buy bitcoin, because you know it’s going to crash again

next level conspiracy, it is a test to weed out all the less intelligent people from owning a large amount of money, which in turn propels humanity to a new future where the rich are also the smart. It depends how you see it though, and how your survival is caught up in this evolutionary mess you call "7 billion people"

So people have to write to politicans to secure their 401ks just in case they might be stolen because of mismanagement? well that’s not appropriate at all. 
I’m pretty sure bitcoin is a decent fix over who owns what money, and how it is currency that can’t easily be electronically transferred or stolen, even.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:31:02
this is proof money does not create happiness or comfort. Listen to your elders brothers, they don't know jack shit
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:56:16
I like the analogy that bitcoin is this super hot girl, but shes a bicycle. A bicycle that goes 100km/hr, turns it into a suicidal death machine, as it rolls through the streets. But she's still hot, as long as you understand the hot and crazy logarithmic scale, you will get to know this super hot girl and realize that she is not crazy as long as you ride her properly.
This is gild worthy. Gild me instead of buying bitcoin and we will joke in 4 years how much bitcoin could have been bought with the gild. I'm dead serious.
