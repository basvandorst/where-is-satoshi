Gavin pushed for very controversial hardfork, which also turned out to be completely shit. He claimed it's all totally safe and tested. Turned out to be unsafe and untested. Same guy then believed C. Wright and claimed that he's *sure* Wright is Satoshi.. but later admitted he might have been bamboozled. Ohh and same guy, Gavin, calls himself "Bitcoin chief scientist" although Bitcoin obviously doesn't have one and according to Bitcoin developers, Gavin hasn't deved Bitcoin for years.
Not to mention Gavins many personal attacks towards others, including core devs. I don't want to even dig them up!

Claiming it's ponzi because early adopters made money by selling bitcoins to newer adopters. I can see why people easily think it's a ponzi.
Used by criminals.. Well, money, no matter what kind of, is used by criminals. Some criminal business seems to be better done with bitcoins, as we can see from the darknet markets. But it's not just criminal businesses which benefit from Bitcoin. Again, easy to see why people claim it's used by criminals - and they're not wrong. Criminals prefer better money, too. :)
Low throughput.. It's correct. Decentralized is not as efficient as centralized. Decentralized money is new technology and it will get better throughput. Decentralized money doesn't need to beat centralized money at everything.

It was reasoned by gmaxwell that it wouldn't be better overall to do it as a hardfork; it would be way more messy that way.


Doesn't break wallets (or shouldn't!) The point of soft fork is that it's not breaking anything. There are rules the network follows. Soft fork narrows those rules, so the old rules still accept the more narrow new rules.


Increased code complexity is something current Bitcoin developers have accepted as tolerable. Segwit fixes malleability for good, other fixes.. hard to say.


Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2016-04-21 10:37:09
Malleability has nothing to do with doublespends.




Stating that accidental doublespends are common is simply very wrong. You stated so, I corrected you. Not a big deal.

Well pretty much nobody here in Reddit knows how Bitcoin works on the deep level.
Also 10% of the 44% is 4.4% of total people. I said I'm pretty sure that *less than* 10% of them can describe how Bitcoin works. I also specified what I mean by that, which is that there are nodes who keep the network up, miners who keep it running and issue coins, addresses where you can send bitcoins and finally that there are bitcoin tokens (which they know most likely out of these four.)
So pretty basic, simple way of describing how Bitcoin works.

@_date: 2016-04-28 17:23:12
Yeah. But Bitcoin is slightly different beast. You mess with it you lose instantly and nobody will be there to help you. It's required that people understand the most basic level of how and why the thing even exists. As long as they don't know those details about Bitcoin, they will be using centralized services happily. Why wouldn't they? Centralized services are a lot better for people who do not appreciate Bitcoins main ideas (decentralization -&gt; trust-less, non-permissioned).
If people want to use centralized services, they don't need to use Bitcoin at all. If they use centralized service which uses Bitcoin on the background; no difference.
If people want to use decentralized services, they really do need to know a little bit more. Let's have Tor as an example. It's pretty easy to use Tor without knowing how it works, right? Right. It is. But it's **very** easy to accidentally leak your identity in one way or another. Using Tor properly requires lots of knowledge. If you leak your identity... well, not the end of the world for most as most won't care about your identity - or they don't even connect the dots because they're not looking for you, or anything. But with Bitcoin... Your coins will be stolen as soon as you make a mistake. And there's nothing you can do.

Bitcoin? Anywhere in the world, with almost no fees and you can buy things online with it (though less than what you could with Paypal). So why would they start using BTC?
Most people will happily provide personal information; it's normal these days.
Many miss the point of Bitcoin. It's decentralized so therefore *trust-less* non-permissioned system. Most of the people do not appreciate these things Bitcoin mainly offers. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:53:24


I think this divide doesn't exist. There are lots and lots and lots of bullshit being spewed by some very small but annoying group. They make this block size issue sound way much more important than it is actually. They provide "solution" which is not even a solution. Some of them say it's only a near future solution. However they're happily kicking out all the people who're developing the long term solutions. There's **lots** of fuss - the system is *very* complex. So it's **very** easy to be confused which gives an opportunity for some, the annoying group, to game your opinion.
This small group is just small. They use Bitcoins complexity - that most people don't really *know* how it works - as an edge to steer opinions. They understate the objective importance of decentralization. They lie. They are populist. Many of them don't even know they're doing all this.
But they're just minority. A much bigger group is those who think that not everyone needs to have the ability to run a node. In reality, majority of Bitcoin users do not run a node. The point is that "everybody" should have the ability to run a full-verifying node at some sane cost, at their homes.
What means "running a node"? Being 100% equal to others in the network. This is the *only* way to use Bitcoin in a trust-less, secure way. Many do not value this, and so they don't think this is important. But it is very important *system-wise.* Many consider SPV-usage or connecting to several full nodes as "safe enough". That sounds like safe enough, indeed. But what if everyone, or majority did this? The more SPV usage in the network the less secure it gets.
So increasing the block sizes cause centralization because the requirements to run a full node increase, and some people can't run a node after increased requirements. We also know that block sizes can't be increased very much. 20MB is absolutely centralizing. Even 5MB is too much, according to some analysis.
So why is this block size increasing so damn important for Gavin? And why it was so important for Hearn? Why is this so important for so many? Could it be that there's quite a nice amount of misinformation and the issue has been weighted way too much? People also need to learn the importance and definition of decentralization as the non-knowledge about it has been used as a weapon for last year.
We know that increasing block sizes is not a solution. It's *only* *very* short term help OR it centralizes the network.
I'm pretty sure everyone wants the same thing: Decentralized which makes it trust-less and therefore able to be some sort of "Internet cash" -Bitcoin.

Well, it's called "educated guess." Majority of Bitcoin experts agree with this assumption.


You're missing the point of nodes. You don't (mainly) run the node for others. You run it so *you* can verify everything. You run it to be part of the network, 100% equal to others.

For technical security I'd prefer electrum, external electrum server (own VPS or something, for privacy - but not needed for *security*), and then Trezor.
Trezor handles the wallet itself, signatures etc. Electrum client handles coin control etc. wallet stuff in a lightweight way. Electrum server (+Bitcoin Core) validates and serves the blockchain for you, so you don't need to lose privacy.

See the "'s. People usually call address an account, because it kind of looks to be functioning like bank account (or whatever balance account) if you ignore all the tech behind the front.
If you request info about some specific UTXO, that only reveals you're interested in that UTXO. Not the ownership. If you spend the UTXO, well, that reveals a lot more but let's stick to *owning*, so not spending. Why do you think UTXOs are more easily tied to persons than many might think?
You can hide HD keychain, or you can hide whatever, like words which you could hash - or whatever - into a "raw" key. Just saying that brain wallets don't necessarily need to be HD wallets.

Okay, well say that all the nodes are equal to each other and function exactly the same as others. So they *have* and *validated* the blockchain, just like others. All nodes have validated the blockchain (so, downloaded it obviously too.)
In centralized system there's one party that does everything, others do nothing (or do less). In Bitcoin system, every node does 100% everything as every other node. So, the work is not done just by one party but by all parties. This obviously costs more, hence it's less efficient.


Bitcoin would be centralized (to gain better efficiency) if it was possible. Being trust-less *requires* decentralization which is why Bitcoin is decentralized. This is the *key property* of Bitcoin. Centralized systems can *never* offer this property as it's only obtainable by being decentralized. There are some downsides, such as decreased efficiency etc. But that doesn't make it inferior system.

Miners are not guaranteed to follow fee order or anything. It's likely that at least some miner will take the most money possible (pick highest fee txes first) but it's not guaranteed. Also, it might be that fee levels simply rise to a level where no miner will pick the tx that has to go to blockchain in specific time limit. But there may be ways around that, e.g. RBFing the tx somehow but I don't know if it's possible for LN "emergency" transactions.
Edit: To clarify, I am talking about the emergency LN transactions which are needed if someone doesn't want to follow LN rules and "judgement" has to be made by Bitcoin blockchain.

LN is a way to use Bitcoin transactions. It's an idea, a protocol. Will it improve decentralization? I guess so, because more people can run nodes but still transact cheaper. Compare to the trade-off where you can't run a node but can transact cheaper. (Also, LN *really* scales unlike many other solutions.)
One bad thing (security-wise) is that nobody can guarantee that certain important LN txes will be mined if they have to be mined. There are some mitigating ways around that, though.

How much is enough? 8MB is nothing. How about 100MB? It'll be filled, too. We already see this with Ethereum as their transaction fees are rising too to levels of uncomfortable for buying cryptokittens. There's simply no way to keep fees nonexistent when actual resource costs are significantly higher, as in decentralized systems the load is not divided. Everyone carries the full weight. If weight is too much for you to carry, you can't be equal to others in the network.
First of all, as many as possible need to have the possibility to run a full node if they want to. Full node = 100% equal-to-others in Bitcoin system.
In reality, this question is quite hard to answer shortly and thoroughly. But shortly it (significantly) increases requirements to be 100%-equal-to-others part of Bitcoin system while giving relatively little for that trade-off.

Problems pretty much arise (I guess) if fee levels grow significantly and those LN txes were signed with lower fee. I am not sure if it's possible to re-do those txes (with higher fee) in that situation. I would *guess* no.
So you would need to set a high fee in them, but it might still be too little.

Don't believe all the bullshit you hear around the Internet. It's carefully crafted and deep, suited to trick people like you.
Bitcoin blocksizes were increased slighly (~100% effectively..). More transactions could be fit in the blocks if certain high-factor Bitcoin services used blockchain more wisely. Increasing blocks won't make the scaling problem go away, but it will give us a bunch of other problems. E.g. Ethereum can't be (practically) synced anymore but still they're at capacity and fees are high and getting higher. Etc.

Yeah, but this does not apply when confirmation amount is higher like 2000. Cumulative work on top of the transaction -including block is what matters the most. Right now a single Bitcoin miner with ~12% hashrate could switch to Bcash and override their 2000 blocks silently, making a huge reorg and 2000-blocks worth of rewards to this one miner &amp; nulling all transactions during those last 2000 blocks.
It is likely that this 1/9 difficulty difference increases making it more and more viable to pull an attack on the smaller chain. I don't know why Bcash'ers take this risk, however they do 1-week-notice hard forks and other ridiculously stupid risky choices so it's not surprising.

(Secure) blockchain does not scale very well. That's reality. You hate Bitcoin because the demand is too high and resource supply is too scarce?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:39:37
No, it was never about blocksize. It's about control and money.
Scaling problems are really not that interesting. Mixed up with bullshit and politics, it becomes a nice tool to get more control and make more money. For example r/Btc: people genuinely think they understand the technology well enough to know better than e.g. devs, because the scaling issues have been portrayed as so simple (which is bullshit). In reality it is very hard due to trade-offs and uncertainties.
And in the end you can present your own non-solution to these over-simplified problems to gain control and money. Just need to fool enough people. Bitcoin is meant to function in extreme conditions --something that most altcoins can't do due to relatively bad choices.

Too bad, but that's how it is currently. Need to develop Bitcoin further: fungibility, layers, sidechains etc. But have to keep base layer as good as possible, because everything builds on top of it. Cheaper fees are possible on less secure layers or systems.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:16:05
Yup, seems to be a good use case for altcoins. However, alts do not offer the same security -- not even near to Bitcoin. If your altcoin transactions can be wiped after weeks, how much did those 15-sec confirmed txes really matter?
It's about different trade-offs. Ultimately there's centralization, least fees and least real security (=control). On the other end, there's ultimate decentralization, most fees and best security. There's no middle ground between these really due to the fact that you can only get significantly smaller fees by going to ultimate centralization. What seems to be possible is to leverage the decentralized system on layers: combine the decentralized best-security system and drop the requirement of all nodes to carry all the weight. That's one way to layerize.
High amount of users -&gt; each's weight must be carried by everyone in the network -&gt; very high fees as each user has to compensate the costs paid by all nodes. (Bitcoin doesn't exactly work like this as only miners are paid, but that's a fundamental likely-unsolvable problem. However nodes --who in this sense do "unpaid job"-- can choose to simply not support higher weight (= higher blocksizes)).
Alts do not have high amount of users so it's easy to carry the weight: fees can be ~zero.

He ceased on working on the blocksize limit problem because "he was done"? Well, Bitcoin needs consensus and when he didn't get it with his proposal, he went to tear down that consensus (by pushing it via XT) instead of working to find a solution which gets consensus. Obviously it (BIP101) didn't gain consensus because there are issues with the problem - and he insists there's no problem.
Hearn and Gavin apparently pretty much ditched XT already, which I think is a wise thing to do. And they ditched BIP101 and their reputation by refusing to work collaboratively to find an agreement on how to solve the problem. Everybody else is accepting to do teamwork - and they *are* doing that teamwork. Of course whoever can just stop whenever they want but it's very irresponsible to make a "solution", push it to all people and dismiss critique and stop working on the problem. So they, Hearn and Andressen, lost reputation.

NewDoges would mean nothing if the economic majority refuses to back them, and/or the majority of miners refuse to mine them.
But guess what...if the economic majority did choose them, and the miners mined them...they would be, by definition, bitcoin.
You've proven nothing.
How do you measure economic majority? Don't you see the problem here? Don't you see the problem with that multiple different things call them the same? We can't have 1000 different Bitcoins. Which of them would be the *real* one? Hence, we need to keep consensus even if it meant that some things were not done the best possible way.
Also, BIP50 had consensus behind it. So it was easier and responsible to hard fork to gain better system.


Probably. I've talked and explained these things many many times here. Why? Because it's saddening to see lies stated as facts. My guess is that there's ongoing an orchestrated misinformation campaign which is then boosted by echo chambering by clueless people. Non-tech people who are easier to manipulate with politics. It's not just about the blocksizes. It's a lot wider. Manipulators are abusing the fact that majority of Bitcoin users don't understand the system.


Nope. I always tell why they're wrong.

Cryptographic proof in this case means that the proof was included in blockchain, proving its existence. It *proves* that the hashed data existed at least since that point.


Can't prove that with this presented timestamped hash. I at least can't verify that it existed prior to that block being mined which included this proof hash.




Yup, sure.


Yes, but in this exact case he was using *blockchain-timestamped proof* which doesn't actually prove much due to this timestamp being after bug publishing. This is the thing here making this proof bunk. The proof he provided has a bad timestamp. Simple as that.


I didn't address that. I addressed this blockchain-timestamped proof ("cryptographic proof") Belcher commented. That centralized 3rd party thing is something else than the blockchain-based proof that was presented, and what Belcher commented. After this people learned about this weaker Slack-timestamped proof.

That's just your opinion. I pay with Bitcoin. Why would Bitcoin be a only a settlement system? Do you think it's comparable to SEPA? It's not SEPA.


That's just your opinion. Everyone can use it if they can pay the fees. High security, high costs. Hopefully layers will ease the fees.


That's also just your opinion, not something that makes Bitcoin worthless. Fees could be lower, but in a sense they're not that bad compared to what you get for the fees. Most people probably do not value what they actually get with Bitcoin. Volatility is hard to address as Bitcoin is still searching for its value. There's a lot volatility even in highly controlled fiat world, of course not as much as in Bitcoin.


Most people (99%?) prefer centralized systems anyway. People in general do not value what Bitcoin offers.


It's not a fault of Bitcoin that fees rise. Demand to use Bitcoin is higher driving the fees up. Someone is still paying those fees, even though it may not be you. Obviously someone values Bitcoin and pays the "too high" fees.
What's your solution? What should be done differently? World is not perfect, but only whining about it helps nothing.


Bitcoin is not centralized and can't be shut down. That is one of the things driving up fees. Ultra-secure system like Bitcoin is very valuable! Nobody, not even governments, can stop Bitcoin. It's built to be like that. One downside of this ultra-secure structure is higher fees (than in centralized systems.)


I don't see the logic in this sentence. You need everyone on-board to make it too big to be shutdown? That's not how it works. We've seen that governments will do whatever they do if they can. E.g. removing that gold standard even though everyone used it.


Bitcoin can't be shut down no matter how many people use it or not.


Its security benefits will still apply to the "rich people" who can afford to pay the fees. Remember that if nobody uses Bitcoin the fees are zero. Fees only rise when there's more demand than supply.

I've tested it myself, with significant delay to bypass any "double spend detectors." Though this was a while ago, things may have changed but I doubt it. Some safety for 0-confs could be achieved by those detectors, I think. But it all comes to just accepting the fact that double spends happen and possibly not very many double spend, especially small sums, even if it was super easy to do.


It's "safe" because most people are honest.


This is *opt-in* for senders. Merchants can accept *non RBF-enabled* transactions like they did before. Also, this (or actually full-RBF) was already in the very first Bitcoin version so one could say this is intended functioning of Bitcoin.
FSS-RBF could be fine, too. Though I think this is better since we're *anyway* moving away from 0-conf for good. Well, opt-in RBF is not *really* a step forward to that. It just prepares for the step to be taken.
It's just that merchants can't force users to make reliably non-doublespendable transactions.
Users shouldn't trust 0-conf anyway and so they shouldn't trust FSS-RBF'd transactions either. Unconfirmed transactions are just candidates to be included into a block. Blockchain gives the order.

Yeah.. B. Armstrong apparently sees it a bit differently. I'd guess miners could do pretty much what they want if we (users) trashed Bitcoins consensus about its rules. In practice, I think miners have more power than users would like.

Maybe it would help to not get so offended when someone calls your shitcoin Bcash. Even "Bitcoin ABC" developer did/does that -- there's nothing wrong about it. Term bcash was labeled as _a bad thing_, by certain actors or "community" when it was obviously not going to confuse people like "Bitcoin Cash" does. You know, "Bcash" doesn't help the agenda where "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin" and so on; wouldn't "Bcash is Bitcoin" sound silly?
Again, like numerous people have been saying for a long time, stop trying to fool people to think that Bitcoin Cash is somehow Bitcoin. IT IS NOT BITCOIN. That is _the_ problem people have with Bcash promoters. If your altcoin is somehow superior, why can't it stand on its own?

Transport-layer parameters significantly affect the (technical) security of Bitcoin. *Everything* in Bitcoin is based on that security. Transport-layer parameters are consensus parameters only because of the security.
As mining is too centralized these days, consensus among the community must be kept. Otherwise miners get the power. You can join the development process by for example deving, testing or taking part in the peer review. No devs have power to choose what people run.

It's very hard to to prove it as we can't see who's voting.


OK. I checked it, too. Looks like it has calmed down *a lot.*
First thread: 
Top voted comment in that thread: 
While the comment sounds good and has valid points about public good, there's this: He wonders whether Luke-Jr has something personal against Gavin. Even if it were so, who thinks these guys are that childish?? And talks about beliefs about BIP101. The fact is, these things need *analyzing.* Not beliefs. That is why BIP101 wasn't/isn't widely accepted by community (hasn't gained consensus) nor is merged into Bitcoin Core. BIP101 simply needs more analyzing. We don't know what are the consequences, one can just guess. And as there's no immediate need, it's better to try to fix the problem with smarter solutions. 


In that sense Bitcoin has already lost. Fiat currencies have more acceptance. A less decentralized, trust-needing cryptocurrencies will come and they may easily bypass Bitcoins popularity, just because less decentralized systems can do some things more efficiently. And sadly majority of the people of the world value those things more. As an example, cheap transactions, fast transactions, microtransactions, mobile systems, ease of use, reverseability and so on. Bitcoin offers good things for those who value *censorship resistance for all* the most. 100% trustlessness is the most important thing Bitcoin has, everything else comes after that. 99% trustlessness is simply not enough since then you (or 1/100 of the people) **need** to trust someone else to use the system - and that opens up ways to restrict usage for some.
One can argue that 99% trustlessness is just fine. Huge majority of the users can use the system without problems. Too bad for the 1% who are banned from using the system. Bitcoin is not that kind of system and doesn't need to become like that. BIP101 is a path towards that kind of environment, *in my opinion*, and I think many (or majority of bitcoin community) share this or similar opinion. 4-8MB *now* would possibly be just fine, after same adjustions or even without, though.
OK, then the next comment after that... 


Alright. You're talking about one of the most active Bitcoin developers / maintainers. Some respect, no?
Then 3rd comment ( is just so delusional and disrespectful I don't want to say anything about it, so I'll skip to the 4th.
4th comment: 


Under constant development and improvement it has been working fine. It's nowhere near finished. It's not even at version 1.0 yet! And for sure it needs lots and lots of improvement before all the major issues are fixed for good. Lots of those issues only start to show when Bitcoin grows a lot so it may be easy to think Bitcoin code is finished already.
Anyway, the OP in that thread is somewhat reasonable and seems to listen &amp; understand answers. Overall quite reasonable thread. Trolls have mostly missed that one!
2nd and 3rd threads: some advertisement and someone asking help with Electrum.
4th thread: 
Hate and theymos-slandering. At least comments try to ridicule with that.. But no, sadly there are trolls who want to make it serious. For example, rises to write a comment only to mock theymos. And allegations and assumptions that *everyone* hates theymos, like it's just a fact. Newcomers and people who don't actively follow will get their view about this by reading those shitty comments.
Then someone goes and tells that it doesn't matter who sent the e-mail. And that follows with lots of theymos-hate. I see my own comment there, just trying to make at least some people see what's going on (or how I see these things.) Why I answered exactly that post? The guy states "obvious" things as facts which are lies and/or opinions (based on lies), just like that. And then our troll cheering the hatepost.
OP comes to chime again: "The sender of a Nigerian scam email usually isn't moderating the two main discussion forums for a community that I care a lot about." ( So when did this all become true and fact? WTF?
Luckily some people are trying to make this all look like a joke. They fail somewhat since the trolls are insisting to hold that bullshit theory up. Well, they didn't apparently succee very well since they couldn't make it another huge shitstorm after all.
It looks like the hate has dropped significantly from what it was ~a week ago. Good.
Some threads which show some or huge disrespect and/or hate and of course lots of lies and bullshit. Just skim over them to see the attitudes. The last one shows how arrogant some of the devs around Bitcoin scene are. It's not good.




Yes, but it is what I've observed.

@_date: 2015-12-29 00:42:31
A miner makes a transaction which is included in the bigger block which is fed to your Bitcoin Unlimited nodes. They accept the block, obviously.
Same time the miner makes a smaller block which spends the same outputs but not to you! This block gets accepted by the consensus-following nodes and miners. You could even relay the smaller block a little after the bigger one so you make sure the "Bitcoin" Unlimited nodes get it. Or you could just feed it straight to the node you want to doublespend against.
And there you go, doublespent easily.

Correct. XT has different consensus rules than Bitcoin. XT's consensus rules don't have consensus among Bitcoin community to be correct consensus rules.

Hopefully these help with defining consensus rules. It's a bit tricky. Maybe someone else can provide you with simple definition of consensus rules. Basicly it's the rules about how the blockchain is built and how the transactions are built in it.
You can do lots of things without changing consensus rules: you can redefine transaction OP-codes to mean something else than nothing.. etc. Old nodes would treat them (scripts) as they know it (they ignore the previously non-used valid opcodes) and new nodes would treat them in a new way (have some function instead of nothing). As long as everything is valid for both (old nodes see everything done with these opcodes as valid because the opcodes in their view do nothing), they work on the same chain with same rules. Old nodes of course can't validate things based on the new opcode definitions.

So many important devs will quit working on Bitcoin if that happens.
Bitcoin is doomed if it implements non-analyzed BIP via non-professional way and of course without community or devs consensus.
So we could and most likely would end up in two coins with own chains, which would set us back quite much and would leave room for other cryptocurrencies.
I'd sell in both cases.

But it is easy to double spend! Check out 
People don't double spend because people are honest. Those who are not honest, they double spend. Merchants have reported significant losses due to double spending.
So after all people not double spending relies on people being honest. Real confirmations are needed when you don't want to rely on peoples honesty.

The thread where someone was promoting Bitcoin XT as the solution (and to ditch Bitcoin Core &amp; other Bitcoin implementations) and pushed people to use it, got removed as being offtopic, because it was about a "bitcoin" client which doesn't follow Bitcoins consensus rules. A shitstorm started after that removal.
So then mods stopped moderating r/bitcoin for a day or so.
The front page was full of "SWITCH TO XT IMMEDIATELY OR WE ALL DIE!" -type of posts. And almost all other threads full of that same shit. Literally every single thread on the front page was about XT. So they made this "Topics pertaining to scaling bitcoin must be posted in the stickied thread" -rule, which I guess, is meant to be temporary - obviously. This subreddit is not just about scaling Bitcoin so it's better to not fill it with threads about scaling Bitcoin.
Changes to sorting were made for same reason as points were hidden. Vote manipulation. Just check it out, some people were negrated - no matter what they posted - they were instantly negrated to -10 or less. That is a form of censorship. Actually it's a lot more censorship than what theymos is accused of.




See... Also, just check out r/bitcoinxt and how many of the BIP101/XT'ers discuss. It's full of "let's fuck up everything!!!!" -attitude. For some reason BIP101/XT seems to attract lots of trolls.






That is *not* a sign of anything. It's easy to make dozens of accounts to upvote. (And that has been happening, as I and many others have observed.) So don't rely on the vote counts, rely on the content of the messages. Understand the content and be critical, even if the post had 1000 upvotes.




No. It's what can be observed to be happening at other bitcoin subreddits. Just check 'em. Clueless people are shouting all around, lots of lies and nonsense and stupid accusations. Best I saw today was when someone accused theymos to be that "satoshi" who posted to devs maiing list. His argument: email was sent from same region as theymos. And I sure bet you that a lot of people consider that as enough evidence to start huge shitstorm about how theymos faked email. Shitstorm with that "evidence" happened / is going on.

Maybe as a service provider you should know what you're talking about and quit spreading FUD.
1. RBF is always possible, miners choose. There are always nodes which relay RBF.
2. Doesn't affect accepting 0-conf at all, except that now you can see that RBF-flagged transactions are signaling miners that those transactions are supposed to be replaceable. So it should actually make accepting 0-conf *easier* or at least it doesn't hurt it.
3. *All* transactions can be RBF'd, no matter what the transaction signals. Miners choose.
4. Blockchain determines the order of transactions. All unconfirmed transactions are on the same level (level 0) and don't really have any order.
5. Reliable 0-confs is history. People are not double spending because *people are honest.* And those who are not honest can already double spend *easily* as there are even easy-to-use tools to do just that. I've tested these tools and even made my own - and it really is quite easy. 0-confs are *not* secure *at all.* It mostly depends on the senders honesty if you get double spent or not.
If you wish that Bitcoin evolves into a system where reliable instant confirmations can be achieved, look at Lightning Network - and support it. Reliable opt-in RBF is quite necessary for Lightning, AFAIK.
Don't know about Lightning? It has the possibility to take Bitcoin to the next level with instantly confirmed (micro)transactions, with small fees - and of course it's decentralized. It's so called off-bandwidth scaling solution. Check out

The more you can invest in mining the more profitable it gets to you. This highly pushes mining towards centralization, right?
We've now seen it. For example, Bitfury produces mining chips which are *at least* 100% more efficient in power and electricity than any other previous chips. They don't sell these chips. When the difficulty rises they'll be the last ones to stop their miners. Who shuts down miners first? Small miners with most inefficient chips. Individual miners amount is these days too low. You see lots of pools, yes, but tell me why hashrate increases in all of them at the same time, significantly? Well, maybe someone with miners is using all the pools...

Consensus rules *must* be same for all bitcoin users. It's that simple. There's no voting about those rules. They don't get changed by a vote. You either follow them or you don't use Bitcoin.
How are consensus rules updated? It's very hard and risky. It's meant to be very hard. That's how Bitcoin gets to be gold of the Internet. You can rely on consensus rules, no matter who you are or what you do.
Consensus rules are updated via hard fork only. Old Bitcoin gets rejected by *everyone* and new Bitcoin gets adopted by *everyone*. How to coordinate such update for a decentralized system? Peer review has worked quite well. Long collaborative work is being done and only conservative and uncontroversial patches are done. Preferably consensus rules would be made so they never need to be changed again.
So your BIP would essentially enable people to easily choose what soft fork updates (or hard fork proposals?) they want to use and what not? This could lead to coin losses. 
There's no point in making Bitcoin look like a system with voting. You either follow the hard rules (consensus rules) or you can't be part of Bitcoin. You can choose to follow soft fork'd rules but if you didn't follow them, you would just be running full node which misses lots of data but validates perfectly what it sees. With new opcodes you would see "anyone can spend" outputs everywhere and you wouldn't be validating the real soft forked features, like new opcodes.
Who would this voting feature benefit? I'd say the people who want to trash Bitcoin by breaking its consensus, making it into a chaos. In a decentralized systems you have to have certain rules and they're *not* up to voting.
Preferably longest chain would define Bitcoin blockchain but these days it's not that simple as mining power is very centralized.

Well, as I said, *RBF was in Bitcoin from the beginning.* "Way to go, Satoshi."
It makes double-spending *zero confs* easier, but currently it's just opt-in which means only RBF-flagged transactions get RBF-treatment. Nodes (including miners) could choose to treat all transactions as RBF and some already do. It's a policy.
It's possible that this makes Bitcoin more and more closer to the point where 0-confs are close to 100% unreliable and super easily overridden. Though the situation currently is pretty much that already. Whoever wants to double spend, can already double spend relatively easily and it doesn't even require too much tech knowledge.
Bitcoins blockchain exists to solve this double spending problem. Transaction with 1 conf is 1 conf ahead of 0 conf. 0 confs are equal to each other, they don't have sequence in the blockchain.
And why RBF exists? It has use cases. Full-scale RBF (non opt-in policy) is the end goal of RBF and we will have that at the latest when instant confirmations are possible. (For example in LN system that is so.)
So what good does this opt-in RBF do for now? It helps to scale Bitcoin, for example. One use case: services can group their outgoing payments into a single transaction per block by adding more outputs as people withdraw.

In the end, it goes back to the question: who should be able to fully verify bitcoin (or any other blockchain system). If you think that a couple hundred machines around the world are sufficient decentralization, fine. You can of course use resources accordingly, too. But if there's enough will in the world, a couple hundred or even thousand high-resource server hall machines can be shut down and it won't necessarily be that hard to do. It would be hard improve decentralization at that point. Right now nothing is really threatening blockchain systems, but at least I expect that to change radically in the future.
But if you want that more than just a couple hundred machines can do full verification now and in the future, e.g. you want that *you* can do it with your home system if you want, that's a lot higher state of decentralization. At what cost: less usable resources as everyone in the network *has* to do the same work, so network uses the resources to match the capability of the least resourced participant.
What are the main goals of Bitcoin? Who should be able to verify everything in Bitcoin and who shouldn't, at the cost of more resource cost for the participants?

Bcash widely refers to Bitcoin Cash, not anything else. That Bitcoin/Zcash mashup project you mentioned was made later to use an argument "Bcash already exists, you can't call Bitcoin Cash the same!". Btw, see the hypocrisy in that? At least could you drop the act of "not understanding" what is referred to by term Bcash? Kids play...


If you genuinely "know" that Segwit was a major update making it not Bitcoin anymore, how come you accepted 2010 post-hard fork cryptocurrency system as the "real bitcoin"? Segwit is like CLTV or CSV updates, which happened prior Segwit. How come CLTV or CSV did not make Bitcoin into Bitcoin-CLTV and Bitcoin-CSV?


Shortly: Untrue. Bitcoin is Bitcoin as is defined by Bitcoin.


Bitcoin can be updated. There's no reason to oppose Segwit update, just like there's no reason to oppose e.g. bug patches in any software. (Only people opposing are the ones profiting from said bugs etc.) Well, we all know that BITMAIN has miners which only work on Bcash chain now, as they had hid their use of Asicboost instead of making it overt -- which would've been Segwit-compatible of course. Or in other words, if BITMAIN had announced that their miners are incompatible with Segwit, segwit could've been changed to support their miners. However, BITMAIN didn't want to disclose (instead, they lied that they don't use it) their use of covert asicboost (but which was later revealed by reverse engineering their mining chip), so they made up all these excuse reasons to be against Segwit. In the end, after everybody knew why they really oppose Segwit, Segwit went through just like CLTV and CSV had done.


LN is simply an idea and a way to use Bitcoin transactions in a smart way. It's like you're against Linux OS's because someone made graphical UI's on top of it, and now people have an option to the text-only terminals...
Btw, your "mathematical proof" is nonsense. Google up why. Also try to understand the insanity of saying "LN can't be decentralized". LN is an IDEA. You can use the idea in any way you want!!! LN is a way to use Bitcoin transactions, how the hell can't this be decentralized?

How can anyone else help, when you've been filled with bad information? You need to do the work here.
I'll shortly address your points anyway.
Bcash is simply a shorter, easier name for Bitcoin Cash. As a bonus, it differentiates it clearly from Bitcoin. Some people started calling it "derogatory", because it removes the confusion and clearly marks it as separate from Bitcoin. These are two incompatible systems so it's beneficial to not mix them up. You could argue that you *want* Bcash to be Bitcoin, but that's a totally separate issue and has nothing to do with the fact that two systems should not be called the same. Fact is that Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin. It can't be twisted in any way to make that fact go away.
FYI, this "Bcash" altcoin ( was made to make up this story of "Bcash already exists, you can't call Bitcoin Cash bcash!!". You'd know if you were there, it's hard to dig up discussions of the time, but you can try. The whole point of naming Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash was to ride on the Bitcoin brand. It's bad to cause confusion. Why do you want to cause confusion by not using a clearly distinct name when referring to Bitcoin Cash aka. Bcash? You could also call it "Roger Ver's Project", as RV calls it "my project" himself. :)  (Although in reality it's Jihan's project, to make those covert-ab miners have something to mine...)


Reality is not changed due to your opinion. All the altcoins and whoever claim that they're more Bitcoin than Bitcoin. All the excuses have been seen. Facts still stand: Bitcoin is Bitcoin. You can use other implementations than Bitcoin Core to use Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin Knots and Btcd are Bitcoin clients. It looks to me, that you've misunderstood what means "implementation" as rBtc is twisting that word heavily, and I suppose that's where you mainly learn your bad information from.
(Btw, My AnduckkBitcoinCoin is THE most nearest to REAL BITCOIN in EVERY way, including code, paper and everything imaginable, but people just refuse to call it Bitcoin like I do... :((  )
Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Think why it is so, and why e.g. Bcash is not Bitcoin and why AnduckkBitcoinCoin is not Bitcoin. In any case, causing confusion by mixing up different incompatible systems names is irresponsible. The only reason Bcash supporters insist being called Bitcoin-something (at least), is to ride on the Bitcoin brand. Btw, in my opinion Bitcoin whitepaper didn't even detail Bitcoin (first code version of it), so it's a super bad argument to say something is closer or further from the original Bitcoin white paper. Also, in reality it doesn't matter shit as facts stand. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Calling something else Bitcoin will cause confusion. Do you want to cause confusion? Why?


There's no significant downsides in Segwit update. Why are you not so loud about other updates, like CLTV or CSV? They were applied to Bitcoin just like Segwit. Is it just that you need an excuse why Bitcoin wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore? In any case, that's *your* opinion and no matter what *you* think of it, facts are facts. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
All in all, these things you must learn yourself. If you genuinely think that Bitcoin is "crippled" by some evil actors and that Bitcoin Cash truly is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin, it's hard for others to drive you in the path of facts/reality. Because at this point you've already consumed tons of bad information and most of it is too hard to debunk by others. You have to do the work here.

Large transaction is a transaction including lots of inputs or outputs. The more the actual size of the transaction (in kilobytes) is, more fee you will want to pay to get it accepted by the miners. If you pay a correct fee, a fee that encourages a miner to accept your transaction in a block, it will get in the block. If you pay less than what miners generally want for that sized transactions, too bad... The usual tx fee is 0.0001 btc, btw.
@_date: 2015-12-17 23:05:31
Let's see...
Make a BIP, BIP101. It gets rejected by peer review, so it needs more thinking, analyzing etc. So you go and put the BIP (with a bunch of other rejected BIPs) into an "alternative client", which it actually wasn't anymore after BIP101 merge. (It's a client which uses current Bitcoin blockchain and produces and validates data like Bitcoin *currently* - XT has this protocol rule difference, BIP101, which Bitcoin *does not have because it's got no consensus behind it!*)
Now you go promote this client, essentially trying to tear down the consensus everything is based on. You refuse to do teamwork towards gaining consensus behind a proper, well analyzed non-rushed solution. Conferences to solve the problem your Improvement Idea tries to solve are held. The most important one you refuse to participate, and in general, you refuse to participate in this collaborative work to find a consensus-based solution.
So why didn't Gavin Andresen do things nicely as there *was* no problem and now there are bunch of problems? It's silly that some people claim that Gavin and his BIP101 triggered Bitcoin devs to work on scaling Bitcoin. People who are clueless. Don't be clueless, learn.
And apparently Gavin (and Mike Hearn but after seeing his latest comments and attitude... he turned out to be a joke, so no big deal, thanks for his contributions tho) seems to be just fine with that his XT fork is used as a weapon to attack other Bitcoin devs. Why do you do this??? Bitcoin needs consensus, not people to break it to gain something better (even if it were so!)
Why do you refuse to do teamwork? Why make it political battle?

A brainwallet actually means exactly that you don't write it anywhere. Check  and read the "Precaution" section in the bottom. It's the reason why people say "don't use it".

The whole thing about why brainwallets "are bad" (or why people just say "don't do it") is because people naturally choose weak entropy passphrases. There are lots of computers scanning these. If you attach paper, a device or anything like that, it's not a brainwallet anymore. Brainwallet means "wallet in brains", not on paper/device or relying on something written on anywhere.
And btw, the "brainwallet.org" or something similar.. the one who runs that site is allegedly bruteforcing the brainwallets generated at that site. They used bad rng or something (possibly on purpose).

Did people care about internet? E-mail? Facebook? Reddit? Youtube?
1. Internet. Enables fast data sharing. But it needs applications to enable its possibilities..
2. E-mail. A major "product" for the internet protocol. Enabled super fast (private) information sharing and communicating.
3. Facebook. A simple everyday communication product. It's a database of people. You can easily keep track on peoples lives without asking everyone, people are curious which is why Facebook is so popular.
4. Reddit. There are so much news that there's simply not enough time to read everything. Reddit gathers the generally most interesting stuff, chosen by people.
5. Youtube. TV everywhere, anytime, with unlimited content - and even you can be on the TV!
People don't really need the applications of internet, all these functions were possible even before internet, just not in such a big scale or as refined as these days. People are able to send letters via mail, people can keep phonebook and have social meetings where they share things about their lives, local newspapers gathered the most interesting news from the world. And we had a TV, it just wasn't showing all kinds of content all the time.
What Bitcoin does to the value transfers we do via credit cards and banks? Well, a lot can be done. Though, you can already move money around the world, just like you were able to send mail. Mailing a letter may cost you half a dollar, mailing an email may cost you nothing. Sending money to the other side of the world may cost you $50, sending money to the other side of the world may cost you nothing. Majority of people will choose the better system for everyday usage.

It's pretty hard to make a good brain wallet. It's even harder to remember it. If you want something like a brain wallet, make a HD seed (using Electrum for example) and memorize the seed or use it as your private key.

Two easy ways to contribute. 
1. If your ISP allows, seed blockchain bootstrap.dat file. Search bitcointalk for jgarzik post about it. On a X-less Linux box easiest may be rtorrent.
2. Set up a full node. Short instructions (for linux): 1. Install git on the server. 2. Next we fetch the source from Github where bitcoin source is, branch 0.9.3 is good for this. Do: git clone -b 0.9.3  3. go to bitcoin folder and open bitcoin/doc/build-unix.md for compiling instructions. It's pretty straightforward after you've all the dependencies. You can build it without wallet too, there's a switch for that (details in build-unix.md). 4. Open/make ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf and set rpcuser and rpcport. 5. Go to bitcoin/src folder and run bitcoind. ./bitcoin -daemon -listen=1

5. Don't re-use same address unless you know what you're doing and what effects it has.
6. 80% drop in usd/btc isn't that bad when +3000% follows (edit: , even if it didn't.)
7. If you think bitcoin as an investment, remember that you can only lose 100%. some people forget this.
8. Don't use brainwallets. It's not so easy to do well and the benefits for normal usage are minimal.
there's some 8.

There are lots of things which make a privatekey a brainwallet. "Except with their encryption cyphertext written down" has nothing to do with this. Brainwallet is one of the ways to make a bitcoin private key.

The book is bad. It could be good but it's bad. Most of this book readers are most likely people who don't know cold facts about Bitcoin, so newcomers.

If the first transaction is deleted from bc.info, bc.info would happily accept the "double spend." If bc.info knows about the transaction, or sees that the inputs have been spent elsewhere, it won't accept it. But you could push it from your own bitcoin core node.

The thing is... As the review says, as even the book description hints: it's bullshit. Even the name of the book shows the writer doesn't know or understand what Bitcoin is. According to the review, the book is very biased and the "arguments" are based on everything else but facts. That is absolutely not a good book to read, right? You will learn nothing but anger from a book like that. If you want to verify the review is accurate, then read the book. If you want real contrast, read some quality stuff. According to the review this book isn't quality.

Why? I find it an excellent method. Orders could be shipped to you (so no re-shipping needed if the merchant sends to your country,) which means that you could just get someone to pay for your order which you can then pay in bitcoins.

What did they remove? Good, tested code.
What did they add? Bad, untested, broken ideas -- and even implemented them badly, without testing.
Doesn't that sound insane? If it does, it's because it is insane. I don't know why BU should be named as a legitimate option to improve Bitcoin. BU is simply very stupid shit, but it's got about $1M funding from Roger, so they keep on going possibly for some time to come.

OK. Bad wording by me, fixing. What I mean is that the blocksize limit doesn't really change the scalability of the system. And the scalability of the system is what it is, no matter what the blocksizes are.
So I mean scalability, not capacity. Safely usable capacity is determined by how scalable the system is. Blocksize limit is one of the security parameters limiting the system to be in the safe-capacity zone.

You are not required to use the biggest routing node.
Also, if and when there will be fees, they will most likely be very low. This is because the transaction is validated only by a few parties so not everyone knows (or needs to know) about all the transactions.


Can you please clarify how this is a bad thing? Nobody is required to use any hub. Anyone can act as a hub. There's nothing one can do when people choose to use centralized stuff either. But as said, these hubs can't steal funds etc. So while there will most likely be big routing nodes, they are just that. Routing nodes. And everyone can choose what nodes they use anyway, or if they act as one themselves.

Yes. So far I've only seen *excellent* work being done by them. So I don't see any threat so far. They've contributed hugely for all of us. It's *great!*
Also note that these people *formed* the said company which now employs a *significant* amount of them (naturally). They're not the majority, btw.


The related mod decisions have been carefully examined many many times. Briefly, the problematic thing is this:
Consensus rules can't be changed if you want to use Bitcoin. We all can't have our own consensus rules. Miners are not deciding what are the consensus rules. So let's just have an open fight over the blockchain rules? Well, sadly that fight winner will be chosen by the miners. And we don't want miners to decide the consensus rules. So who should choose? Educated users, those who know how the system works and can discuss these things well. Peer review. Consensus before actions. Currently I'd estimate over 90% of these people are with Core and their plan, instead of other plans.
And the mods don't want that incompatible "nodes" are spread around here, as those nodes gaining popularity would lead to the open fight which outcome would be decided by the miners. Also remember that Reddit is quite easily manipulated. Outside the reddit these things are (and always were) much clearer, the support is heavily on the Core side. You've probably seen manipulation in all directions here. All in all I'd say r/Bitcoin is the most readable source for Bitcoin information.


Googled up this, related to that: 
Instead of this, why wouldn't he just collaborate and do things in public? Because his ideas are garbage and he knows they won't pass the peer review of experts. This issue is pretty much solely technical as long as we agree on that decentralization is the most important aspect of Bitcoin.

This is the shit-throwing part, followed by Roger leaving: 
Like, why the hell does Roger need to recap what Johnny has said? Alright then, so he does the recap *but colours what Johnny actually said*, changing the whole narrative of Johnny's. I think that was quite low by Roger - and it certainly was intentional.
All in all, Roger pretty much argued from one point of view. He completely ignores that we can't go back in time to those days with low fees and "0-conf 99% times gets confirmed" etc. by removing the limits (doing the BU), because that would kill decentralization - the thing that Bitcoin builds on.
And apparently when Roger doesn't seemingly *understand* the points (which in this case are highly technology-related), he starts to play with emotions and do the basic politician tricks.
It's just that developing Bitcoin is not meant for everyone. You *need* to know the basics of various  (mostly technological) things, e.g. what is decentralization in Bitcoin and why Bitcoin requires it. Roger doesn't know this, based on the radio show. Doesn't make him satan though.

If it was $100 usd bet, you have 2 outcomes and you can hedge it:
1: You sell a bitcoin now at $200, take the bet, bitcoin drops to $100 - you've now gained $100 and lost $100 so no profit, no loss.
2: You sell a bitcoin now at $200, take the bet,
bitcoin goes to $1000, you've won $100. (Though you've missed a $800 increase in that bitcoin value but this shouldn't matter as long as you're not all-in.)

So you mean you pay $0.00 instead of $0.02 to the miner to include your transaction? And the miner isn't even carrying all the weight but still gets all the reward! Nodes have to validate your transaction and you're paying them nothing. All the future nodes also have to validate your transaction. Etc. It's not cheap to do transactions in a decentralized system like Bitcoin. Or well, currently it is very cheap. We'll see how it goes. Centralized services will always be more efficient and cheaper to use, at least by looking at the computing power and other resources required for the transaction.

There's a good reason to limit the transaction capacity: decentralization. So individual people can validate all the transactions and be full part of the network, equal to others.
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:09:44


Segwit is already here, only to be deployed in the production network. It's active in the testnet, as you mentioned. It is not a scaling solution but if we say increasing blocksize limit is a scaling solution, then segwit is also such. Segwit increases the amount of possible transaction-bytes over the 1MB limit by segregating the witness parts.
How is the *hard-fork* limit increase supposed to roll-out? Before segwit which is most likely happening in 1-2 months?

Well, 56k modem users can validate the system by downloading blocks only. Would take about 3-4 minutes to download a full block. Syncing would be quite near impossible, though. Would take 8-15 months to download the blockchain.

Gavin *knows* these things. While he states something he knows is bullshit, he's lying. Simple.
Everyone can see that libsecp256k1 was made, and supported by *everyone.* Libsecp256k1 is one very much needed on-chain scaling solution.
And that is just one example. Something to also note is that it's not about being on-chain. It's about being *getting the same benefits as being on-chain.* Such may possible. Lightning is pretty near as it's off-bandwidth &amp; on-chainable by any participant at any time.

You're being fed this. Now you're spreading the same bullshit around. Some people are intentionally misrepresenting lots and lots of things they know are lies. For example, Bitcoin Core is whoever wants to submit code to them, or work for the project. There should be lots of different implementations for wallets, even nodes but the consensus rules are something that *all* the bitcoin users have to have the same. You can't have different consensus rules if you use Bitcoin, it's that simple.


Pretty heavy. Have a look at the Classic "side"? Gavins backroom deals pissed many people off, classic "supporters" have manipulated the voting system (admitted by Reddit admins), etc etc.

Could you please provide some examples of these things you've seen happening?
Bitcoin Core doesn't want a leader. Granted, the development may be harder and slower but it's also safer. Not *significantly* slower, btw, at least currently. Gavin also rushed with some things, like P2SH. It would have been much better if it was deployed few months later. Similar to this: If Bitcoin Core had gone with the 20MB blocks, we would have very centralized very unsafe Bitcoin currently - assuming that community would have followed Core. Even 8MB has been analyzed to be too much - Gavin initially said 20MB is safe - and then that 8MB is safe. Better safe than sorry - Bitcoin is that big. Most of all I don't like that Gavin is not doing things collaboratively. He could but he refuses to. It's OK but not if there are competing consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-01-01 17:48:23
Funding the network may come from soft-limit (soft-fork?) minimum fee to include tx in a block. Other miners can discard blocks which include too much free transactions, in the extreme case.
There will be mutual minimum fee to transact. All this will happen naturally as users wan't miners to mine (to secure network) and miners don't want to stop mining and they (most of them) won't do it for free.
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:50:26
Bitcoin.com is a lot different from bitcoin.org.
Bitcoin.com is for-profit site and the owner lets people know that they can and will do anything with it, for profit.
Bitcoin.org is meant to be neutral source for Bitcoin information. Of course there are borders to neutrality. As an example, consensus rules are *not* up to voting. Consensus rules itself can have a rule that allows voting about some parameter value but that's a lot different thing. Some people fail to understand the importance of consensus rules and what it means to alter or try to alter them.
Bitcoin.org, while being privately owned, have stated to have the role mentioned above. Without changing the agenda, they're pretty much obliged to do as they say.

Well, there are lots of problems which should've never appeared if at least some software engineering tech had been used. Then there are some that are annoying but not critical, like that the wallet used to generate transactions which wouldn't get relayed because of the "change" output being too little. And then there's the problems which were fixed way too late or never.
Specific problems: 
One of the major problems is the quality of the whole process to do these things. Like, is there zero testing of the code or is it just published to production instantly?
One more I almost forgot, a bit annoying but not critical: the import wallet section. I still don't know if importing wallet.dat works.

These days there's lots more data and it's known that with higher limits there would be too much resources needed for many to use the system.

Why Bitcoin exists? to make cheap transactions or to have central authority -free money?

I am talking about the ways more well-resourced miners can kick not so well-resourced miners off the network. BU would allow this as miners are in charge in BU. Miners would seek for highest profits. You get higher profits when you kick out other, smaller miners, without anybody noticing. Of course the small miner can whine that he can't mine anymore but if 99% can, who cares? Repeat kicking the 1% off as many times as needed. When it happens over time, nobody notices as it's not immediate or even visible in a p2p network.
@_date: 2016-03-26 12:44:02

Bitcoin solves one major thing others couldn't: centralization.
Why are some other aspects important enough to weaken centralization? You can build whatever, even centralized networks on top of decentralized network - but you can't do it vice versa. Can't build decentralized network on top of centralized network.
Also, the benefits of especially this simple limit bump to 2MB are *very* questionable. Remember that even Gavin was *strongly* against something like this, only a little less than a year ago! That is *not* rational.
So makes me wonder why do this.. My guess is that some people are honestly thinking they're doing the good thing while some parties who want to see Bitcoin fail are boosting whatever makes them closer to the goal. Dividing the community is one great way to sabotage the project.

Yes, we should increase the size of the bus. But *only* if it comes without meaningful (yes, subjective and why it's very hard to say anything about it) downsides which would make the bus nothing. Remember that the bus only exists because... well, hard one, but say the bus never crashes into the trees because it's steered by anyone who wants, and not a single person can steer it towards trees. Other buses have single driver and occasionally they crash them into trees. What makes this small 10-seat bus unique is that it *absolutely never* crashes into the trees.
The size of the bus shouldn't be changed even if 2000 people wanted a ride with it. The increased interest to ride the bus is not a reason to change the bus.
Maybe some other analogy instead of buses could work better...

There's some PM spam coming, an edit to this image is being spread: 
What I replied to their PM:
You have factual errors in the text.
1) Blockstream didn't buy any devs. Devs formed Blockstream. Blockstream makes open source software. People choose whether they use it or don't. Bitcoin Core is developed by many people and Blockstream employees are not a majority and they don't choose what is merged.
2) Blockstream pays for key developers, to make open source code. Isn't this a good thing? Nobody works for free and this is like the best possible way - the devs forming the company to pay themselves salary.
3) What do you mean by crippling? To me it looks like they've contributed more than anyone to Bitcoin. Remember libsecp256k1? Segwit? Many many BIPs. What do you mean by that they would gain financial gain from crippling Bitcoin? They have their salaries timelocked tied to Bitcoin. What solution they have that would bring them financial gain, that is not Bitcoin?
4) Blockstream is not forcing people to use the limit. It's just that consensus among community seems to favor the limit. So be it. People like the limit because it secures the decentralization. Decentralization is the reason Bitcoin exists.
5) Not 3 TPS, it is 7 TPS.
6) There are lots of parties developing Lightning Network solutions. At least 3 parties have told about their work publicly. Blockstream pays one developer to dev Lightning network. Lightning network is not a hub-spoke model. Lightning network is open source. It is decentralized, like Bitcoin. There is no central authority to pick fees.
7) Blockstream is not related to bitcointalk.org or r/Bitcoin. Many of them (individuals working for Blockstream and Bitcoin Core) are against some parts of the moderation, especially those parts people claim are censorship.
8) People can discuss these things freely on r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk.org, among all other forums. Only r/btc is getting censored by instant downvotes as they do not fight against the manipulation.
9) Satoshi said whatever he said OVER 5 YEARS AGO. Bitcoin was not a big deal back then. Things change. Current experts know way more than Satoshi did. It's simply because now there's a lot more data and things evolve of course. Also, Satoshi said the limit is required but what Satoshi said doesn't matter at all. We're talking about technical problem here. Doesn't matter who says but what says.
10) Bitcoin Classic is willing to include privacy-invading code changes to their repository.
11) r/Btc censors a lot more discussion than any other Bitcoin discussion board. For example these things I've mentioned here, you would've known if you weren't being censored this stuff. You're being fed the hate, fud and rage and it seems to work. Please understand this.
12) Blockstream is not a central authority. Do they force you to use some client or some rules? No! I and other Bitcoin users do.

You announce your support for a fork project (XT) which has claimed that they will do just that, with checkpoints if necessary. Shouldn't be that surprised?


Would you support the longest chain if miners declared to update their block reward to 500 BTC per block and started producing these blocks? You say that won't happen? Never say never - mining is too centralized as of today - and if BTC/USD falls too much lots of bad ideas will be brought up.


Indeed, you would not as that wouldn't be **valid**. So what is valid?


Economic majority - that's *not* measurable nor should consensus protocol decisions rely on that. Economic majority of the world is fine with fiat banks, centralization and hidden fees. The issues of centralization usually hit only a small percentage of users, therefore it's not very good to look what the majority wants.
Only option is to divide into multiple chains or stick to what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is *decentralized, trust-less Internet cash*. If some people want something else, they can make their own system. Calling it Bitcoin is not cool, though.


This hardly reads as "We are only experimenting with BitcoinXT and we don't actually rely on it."
You said Coinbase is running XT in production, now you claim that is not the case. That is pretty confusing.
So which is better, a tweet from CEO or Reddit post from CEO? This Reddit post I guess since you declared it as official.


This is good. But why state that you will move to XT at certain date (and later that you moved to XT in production)? Bitcoin XT could be changing the consensus rules without consensus about changing them. XT has been programmed to change Bitcoins core functionality on non-consensus based event. It's irresponsible to support such way to change (or attempt to change) Bitcoins consensus functioning. The whole thing is very risky as you may now see. Developing Bitcoins *core rules* aka consensus rules must be done collaboratively - because there can be only one Bitcoin and miners are *not* choosing how it works.
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:00:59
Too bad that Bitcoin is used so much and $5 txes are priced out when fees have risen. The capacity is limited because it would be insane to increase it significantly (say 10-100x), which would get us back to $0.05 fees *for a while*. But what happens even at 5x capacity increase? Decentralization weakens *a lot*, the overall weight added is simply not worth it. Bitcoin is built to be decentralized. Would be insane to weaken decentralization that much to gain short-term can-kicking gains.
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:36:06
It's currently there due to technical reasons. The cap could be increased safely (ignoring the problems of hard fork), but not very much. After all the whole cap, set at any value, does not fix the real issue. So it's actually not very important re: bitcoin scalability. It would always be too low, no matter what (non-centralized) value it's set at. *Currently* it would solve near-term soon-to-be-a-problem blocksize limit problems. But that's what for Segwit as a softwork will be implemented pretty soon. Segwit will increase the capacity quite nicely, without a hard fork.
So what are the technical reasons?
 is a good read.
Most of all the limit is to keep bitcoin decentralized. How it does that? Bitcoin is not controlled by those who have the power (or most resources like bandwidth, CPU, storage etc.) Without the limit they would be in control. Nodes and mining would be centralized as there would be incentive to centralize them.
There are lots and lots of details, smaller and bigger. Those details make bitcoin scaling a complex thing.

Yes. The reason was that some people were running different rules than others, as you can read from the link.


Because even simple changes in the consensus rules may divide people in to different chains? Indeed.

You can specify to have a week to pay. If you leave the payment at the last minutes, who can you blame.


I'm sure market will find a solution. Reminder services? Automation? Long enough times?


Very bearable complicity. Look at the benefits!


6 confirmations is a standard confirmation time.


Reorg doesn't affect these. Btw, if miners refuse to include your transaction you're using a centralized service. That would mean Bitcoin has failed.


Dunno. Make new contracts instead while waiting for it to solve? This question of yours is a valid one but hard to assess. Similar questions can be asked about Bitcoin we use today. Like, what happens if miners set soft limit at 10 kB? What if some portion of miners stop accepting txes which don't pay a minimum of 1 BTC txfee? It would cause a backlog.

@_date: 2016-01-20 22:15:53


This is true but doesn't change what I described. I think it's fair to say that after a certain point in blocksizes the requirements to run a full node increase faster than the amount of users who want to run full node and have the ability to.


Are you full part of the network if you can't propagate the data to others? Well, anyway the most important thing from individuals point of view is the ability to validate the blockchain. If you can't even validate the blockchain, then you're seriously not using Bitcoin, the peer-to-peer cash, as a full member. Peer-to-peer means that all the peers are equal (full members as I call it.)


Probably. It takes time to improve the scalability and then change the safety limits accordingly. Would be a lot easier for centralized system.


Blockchain is not getting saturated. Statistics prove this. And statistics even suggest that most Bitcoin users currently overpay! Granted that sometimes there are spikes in the usage when blocks are full in a row. A decent fee, like $0.10, should still fix the problem.


That's quite subjective. In my mempool... Looks like lots of very low fee low value transactions.




Only natural for system like Bitcoin. This was predicted. Also, what would happen if user amount increases by 10x overnight? Blocksizes should be increased to 10MB which would cause significant centralization and drop lots peers out of the network.
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:22:47

Stop bullshitting people. Core is a software project made by large group of people. Many people who also contribute to Core, have submitted several hard fork block size limit increase proposals. None of them gained consensus. That's how it works!
Also, SegWit *increases block sizes*, it *increases* block sizes. IT INCREASES BLOCK SIZES. IT IS ON-CHAIN SCALING. And Segwit makes *real* scalability improvements possible, such as Schnorr, MAST, LN etc.


Again, stop bullshitting people. Segwit increases block sizes 70 to 120%. That's roughly a 2x gain: 2MB blocks! Segwit SF **IS** 2 MB INCREASE BUNDLED WITH SEGWIT.
Jihan Wu opposes Segwit, who knows why. Likely there's external money involved. Technically competent people do not oppose Segwit. This is how no-brainer update it actually is.
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:35:25
I am asking this generally.
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:44:40
Currently there has to be artificial limit. It may be so that it can never be removed.
What happens if the limit doesn't exist?
Bigger blocks would be produced. There would always be some % of users who couldn't handle the bigger blocks, so they would drop out of the network.
Step 1. There's 1000 Bitcoin users who want to run full node. While the blocksize is A, they can run full node.
When someone starts producing bigger blocks (A+B) and sees that supermajority of the other full node operators can handle them, happens this: Say that the supermajority is 950 nodes out of the initial 1000. 50 of the nodes can't handle these bigger blocks but as they're minority, nobody cares about their opinion. The system works fine without them.
Step 2. So now we have 950 nodes with avg blocksizes of A+B.
Step 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the system is centralized.
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:05:34
Well, it's more about that increasing the blocksizes solves absolutely nothing. Right now lots of people can't use Bitcoin because the limit is at 1MB. What if it was 2MB? Even less. 5MB? 10MB?
And 10MB would only allow 10x the current users.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:42:56

Yes, but there's great incentive to do that.


It's very controversial to do the fork. Not that people aren't supporting 2MB sized blocks. (And actually segwit pretty much gets us to that 2MB limit.) So it should be fine. 


So suddenly everyone jumps on the "non-minority" chain? Nope. **Nope.** And as we've seen people are *not* supporting the "Bitcoin Classic" approach so.. Can't we just get over with that (as currently it's only causing noise as it is not approved as a solution, by the community, obviously, as you can see how little the support for that is) and proceed with the segwit etc?

Gavin is outright lying here. He knows very well that people are working on on-chain scalability solutions. For example, libsecp256k1 is a one fine example of that work, work that has been going on actively for years.
And he should know that increasing the blocksizes is *not* on-chain scalability solution. It's simply removing the limit to let the system float free to be centralized, inaccessible to those who can't afford huge bandwidth, huge cpu etc.
He really should stop bashing others. Also, these politics are not going to lead us into a better world. So instead of these posts, why not work towards the goal and preferably together?
I mean.. He knows that blocksizes can't raise very much. User amounts increase by 10x? Can Bitcoin blocksizes be increased 10x? Not without significant centralization. Bitcoin *is made to solve centralization problem.* So why the hell is he bashing long-term solutions now too? He thinks that rising blocksizes **is** the long-term solutions? How is it, I am pretty sure sane Classic supporters would also like to hear your answer to this: do you think that blocksizes can be increased everytime there's a need, to keep the fees low? If not, what should be done instead?

This is what would happen if Roger got his way and BU took over: everyone would lose because BU is technically pure shit.

Reddit is not great as people use it very wrong. People care too much about the vote count. It means literally *nothing* as it can be gamed very easily.
FYI I downvoted you because you state very weird things, like:


Mike not honoring the peer review, using politics to gain popularity etc. Overall not doing things in good manner. I'd say Mike pushed everyone else away. Ostracized himself.
What is the consequence of "taking the matters to the people": These days lots of people consider highly technical issues simple or something they can understand easily. Obviously it isn't so which leads to lots of misinformation (small or big) being spread by incompetent people. Lots of this (mis)information is spread in good faith. It's very frustrating for developers to actually develop things in that kind of environment. 
This doesn't mean people doesn't have the power. This simply means that the whole project now suffers from lots of noise and therefore worse SNR.


New data is gathered all the time. Things evolve. Satoshi's work is highly appreciated no matter what.


I find this quite weird, too. Hard forking may cause instant losses for the non-updated nodes. Also, it's very damn hard to coordinate a hard fork in consensus-based decentralized system. Miners can't choose everything as mining is very centralized; Bitcoin is not in the hands of 10 people.

I don't really care. Segwit is as no-brainer as CSV or CLTV updates. I don't know why certain people try to paint Segwit as even remotely controversial. There's no reasonable reason to oppose Segwit. Well, okay, the only reasonable reason is that it increases block sizes and some parties do not want that. But I guess the consensus is that block sizes can be increased safely to 2MB.


Tell me about any possible sane reason to block Segwit. I already named the only one I know of: it increases block sizes.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:52:49


Nope. Malicious (or profit-seeking) miners would make blocks that do not work with compact blocks. E.g. they make a block full of earlier-unseen transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:30:12


Well, as I see it there's quite a lot differences. Consider.it is meant as a voting platform for everyone. Github is meant for technical talk and all the ACKs and NACKs etc. are related to that only.


Fine, no more joking. Anti-Core people will use it as a weapon!
Also, remember that "Core" is everyone who ~~wants to~~ contributes to Bitcoin Core. There are no restrictions, you can contribute if you want. Therefore I find it quite silly to go against Core; why don't you improve things re: Core? For example people blame them for bad communication, which is at some level true. Communication should be better. So why don't you go and improve it? And so on...

A profit-seeking miner willing to do anything to make profit.


Yup. For miners the incentive is to mine whatever cryptocurrency that makes them the most money.


I'm sure they're willing to do this if it pays them better than just mining. Remember that there are lots of parties around the world who would love to see Bitcoin die - and some of them are very loaded.


The incentive model is that it rewards people playing with the correct rules. Miners do not set these rules. Miners playing with bad rules are not rewarded by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:43:17
They also. Everybody wants capacity increases. Blocksize limit increase is not a scalability improvement. Scalability is increased by improving the system to be able to handle more and more. Ability to create bigger blocks is not related.
Anyway, blocksize limit is the value set to limit blocksizes so they are in the safe limits. Safe limit is increased as the network gets more optimized and developed.
Currently 2MB can be done *safely*. Bitcoin Core roadmap is targeting at increasing the blocksizes soon with SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:40:13


People should educate themselves and not rely on some Reddit comments as their sources. Go to the roots of the information and do the work yourself, then you learn.
Community wants Segwit, exchanges support Segwit, other services support Segwit. Only some miner wants something else. 


Just pointing out the bullshit some groups bring in here. When you talk about stuff and drop in several lies, and you even signal that you're knowledgeable - but you obviously aren't, then you deserve some more harsh replies.

Forks, sure! Differing implementations are always good. Except for the *consensus rules* which must be absolutely same for all Bitcoin users. Everything else can be changed.

Just trying to signal that it's not the important thing here. 
Blocksizes must increase from 1MB, that's for sure. However, bigger blocks do not help much. Bigger blocks is not the solution to scalability problem. Lots of people would decrease the security of Bitcoin to achieve higher user count. What if bitcoin user amount increases by 10x overnight? See

No, this has nothing to do with *opinions.*
There are some people who are simply not aware of how Bitcoin works, including what is the incentive model of it and how Bitcoin is secured. These things are *very* complex.
Complex things can be twisted in various ways. For example, we've seen the increase of politics and such.
One of the things that hold Bitcoin together are *consensus rules.* They simply *cannot* be differing for Bitcoin users. Promoting the usage of different consensus rules is therefore *bad* for Bitcoin. Promoting update to the consensus rules is *different* and it is *not* tearing down Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:58:28


If I have to rely on someone else to use the *decentralized, peer-to-peer Internet cash*... Well, that is what I call centralized. Same as if you had to use some 3rd party service to use torrents!
Most of all people should remember that there's no blocksize limit that could serve the system well if the user amounts rise heavily. So the blocksize is not actually that interesting - at least it shouldn't be changed to gain some near-term benefits if it costs pretty much anything. Hard forking for that is pretty heavy cost.

Actually analysis shows that there was no significant malleated txes around that time.. Or before that time.
"In this work we use traces of the Bitcoin network for over a year preceding the filing to show that, while the problem is real, there was no widespread use of malleability attacks before the closure of MtGox."
"MtGox claimed to have lost 850,000
bitcoins due to malleability attacks, we merely observed a total of 302,000 bitcoins
ever being involved in malleability attacks. Of these, only 1,811 bitcoins
were in attacks before MtGox stopped users from withdrawing bitcoins. Even
more, 78.64% of these attacks were ineffective. As such, barely 386 bitcoins
could have been stolen using malleability attacks from MtGox or from other
businesses. Even if all of these attacks were targeted against MtGox, MtGox
needs to explain the whereabouts of 849,600 bitcoins."

I guess you can say this about anything.
Decentralization is one of the core values of Bitcoin. BU wants to fully centralize Bitcoin mining. I could go into details about this if you want. Anyway, Bitcoin is built on decentralization and no politics will change that fact. Bitcoin is a very technical and complex system.
Also, Bitcoin has this rule that its core rules cannot be updated without unanimous support. BU does not have unanimous support and they seek to change Bitcoins core rules, therefore they are technically an altcoin and not Bitcoin.

People often forget that Core is *everyone who wants to contribute.* It's not a closed project.
At least regarding consensus rules it's essential to govern them as has been done so far. Bitcoins' consensus rules are not governed by democracy. 51% doesn't choose how Bitcoin works. It needs pretty much 100% support to change the rules, but as that's not possible in real life, it means 100% support from "everyone who matters" which is quite vague term but I'm sure you know what I mean.
For other parts of the software... everything can be forked, why not. Consensus rules can also be changed, why not, but one should not call it Bitcoin then. It only becomes Bitcoin if the old Bitcoin dies.

Not really. Say 40% of miners wanted a minimum fee of X and rest mined for free. This will likely be the case; some miners accepting transactions for free and some not. If user wants to confirm transaction fast, he pays a fee to be included in the block if that 40% of miners happens to mine the next block. Majority of miners won't mine for free, as they have no incentive to do so.

@_date: 2017-03-09 19:34:04




What happens when e.g. 99% of the network is OK with the larger block? The remaining 1% is not and their voice is not heard because for 99% it's OK.
What happens when the 1% gets dropped, say 100 times? When it happens relatively slowly, it's very hard to see happening and it centralizes mining and Bitcoin network. 


This would be free market where miners can kill each other and network would blindly follow. 1% getting kicked out of network at time is not visible to the majority. Bitcoin is for 100%, so this kind of free market enabling people to be kicked out of network should not be supported by any Bitcoiners.


We need consensus and not control by miners. Nothing is centrally controlled. If you want to update the hard protocol rules, you need real consensus. Consensus is very hard to measure. Current consensus is 1 MB maximum block sizes.

My point is that if a company is claiming to be doing something that they don't do.. that is bad. They got removed from Bitcoin.org because of that. People simply thought they had switched to XT which was how their CEOs tweet was generally understood. Later they declared that they do support Bitcoin and XT is just being tested, not in actual production usage.
The thing is, there are no *stances* in Bitcoin. You either use Bitcoin or you don't. Bitcoin is not changed by making alternative rules for yourself and declaring that it is Bitcoin - it only causes confusion and is bad for everyone.

Right. Though I *guess* that more and more transactions will be multisig etc. Even though effective blocksizes may be 1.5MB or something in the beginning, the limit is much higher and blocksizes rise as people start using "better" Bitcoin tech.

I think you're missing the point here. The point is to 1) show that double spending is easy and 2) opt-in RBF has nothing to do with it.
Nothing personal for using Coinbase as an example. Coinbase is big enough so it's good as an example target.

Also, obviously $10 is nominal sum. You should just message him if you want it back, you'll get it back.

@_date: 2016-01-11 13:01:45
RBF is not made to make unconfirmed confirmed. Bitcoin is made for that.
Also, double spending has been easy for a long time, as I said. When nodes policies started to differ, it became easier and easier to doublespend. In most cases you don't even need to have good success rate to be 100% succesfull (cases where you can repeat.) And double spending has quite good odds, I'd say about 50% already. Based on my tests.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:03:34
Yeah well Gavin hasn't exactly been very collaborative during the most important times re: blocksize or scalability overall.
Blog posts aren't really helping with the real problem. But it's fine, maybe some people now learn a lot more about Bitcoin! And the communication inside the community has got a lot better.
But why does Gavin propose this now? He knows it won't pass, other devs are following the roadmap. So why does he propose this as he absolutely knows it will not be merged?

BU has no reviewing. It's known that BU implements a very flawed idea, and is very buggy and otherwise poorly implemented. People treat it as garbage, which it is - not a real competitor to Bitcoin. Knowledgeable people don't waste time by reviewing some garbage fork.
The bug itself was very embarrassing. Had BU project any testing or code reviewing, this would've been detected even by newbie programmers. The whole BU project is a total joke. It's simply so poorly done that it's becoming hard to describe how poor it is.

I don't know if it's intentional or not, but supporting BU is being against Bitcoin. For sure most of the BU supporters are just fools, not malevolent. Simply put, BU would break Bitcoin.

The network works perfectly, nobody is forced out. Block space is scarce - that's built-in feature of Bitcoin.


Segwit is there and is technically no-brainer update as it's also opt-in. BU is very controversial shit piece of software. BU is untested crap as has been proven in practice too. BU is against Segwit. You support BU. You are against Segwit.


Miners are paid by the users to do their job, not to voice their opinion.

Of course and he is perfectly fine with it. If it fails, we can build a new Bitcoin! Remember the "Urgent! Blocks are full!" -blog posts by Gavin, something like a year ago? It was pretty much "i tested it and it's safe to do 20MB block limit now!!!". Turned out 20MB is far from safe. And that there was no urgency and still isn't urgency. And Gavin even said 2MB is too little back then. I really don't get that why Bitcoin should be developed like a headless chicken run.
But OK, one can like the "fast and loose" as a good development method. I just don't see it fit for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:08:27
It's obvious that "longest chain" means "highest cumulative PoW". Also, highest cumulative PoW aka longest chain only dictates the order of transactions, i.e. the correct history. Some people try to fool others to think that PoW can be used to expand rules, which is untrue. (The whole blockchain thing wouldn't exist if rules didn't set its boundaries to begin with.)

You are aware of that the big part of the Bitcoin developers *formed* Blockstream?


What is their business plan? What is the conflict of interest here? Proofs please, no bullshit.
Isn't Blockstream making money by making Bitcoin succeed? To me it certainly looks like they've done a lot to make Bitcoin succeed.


There are some alternative implementations, like btcd. Anyway, care to elaborate what you mean by *this*? What makes me see?


While it would be probably good to know it, they're not obligated to reveal anything.


Hardly any Bitcoin-related company is transparent. For example, tell me exactly, with proofs, how Bitpay makes their money with 0-fee service.
Also now when you're talking about conflict of interest, please remember that Gavin is paid by Coinbase (which started using XT which Gavin advocates) and Mike Hearn is the lead developer of R3. And neither of them have developed code for Bitcoin in a long time!

Let me explain to you. This has been repeated here many times, but it people tend to still not know it. Yet they talk about BU as a possible solution to anything. BU-idiots oversimplify stuff that can't be simplified.
Check out 
Bitcoin Unlimited would allow miners to choose how big blocks they produce and support. According to them, these settings should be dynamic and vary between each individual miners. So those values are whatever individual miners want them to be. Consensus should somehow magically form. Magically, because it's not known to a man. :) Essentially, as explained in the link, the network could be split into two by making one specific-sized block.
On a fundamental level, miners would choose how big blocks they can make. Remember that mining blocks effectively requires you to download and validate others blocks *as soon as possible.* Better resourced miners could make blocks that are just fine for them, but would drop say 5% of the existing miners off as those 5% can't keep up with the better resourced miners. More resourced miners would produce blocks that are too resource-heavy for smaller miners to handle. This would force those 5% out because for those 5% mining wouldn't be worth it if they can't get the blocks in time. Now repeat this scenario over and over again, always killing 5% of the existing miners. 95% turns into ~90% etc.. Soon only the most well-resourced miners exist and rule the blockchain.

BU is retarded. Do you suggest that we shouldn't call it what it in reality is?
Look, there are people who want smaller blocks and there are people who want bigger blocks. Only idiots want shit. BU is shit.

Those hardforks are usually about increasing the blocksizes. This would mean more and more cheap transactions, so more attractive to most of the people. But, increasing blocksizes also makes Bitcoin less decentralized, introduces additional risks (mostly related to decentralization like mining centralization), increases minimum requirements to be part of Bitcoin network (validate &amp; share blocks). Etc... The downsides are not really downsides for companies. But more users is always very good. Increasing Bitcoin efficiency like that decreases Bitcoin security.

Any increase would be consumed, by spam if there's not enough usage. What do you consider low enough fee to be considered spam? Increased blocksizes increase minimum requirements to be fully equal-to-others part of Bitcoin.
Currently our average fees are around $0.35/kB which means roughly $0.085 per 1-input 2-output transaction. (check 
However, the chart above also shows that roughly half of that would be enough most of the times to be included in the next block.
So is there really urgency yet? Slightly cheaper fees (&amp; more spam, less decentralization) to gain short-term benefits? While we could strengthen what we have and work on the long-term benefits while simultaneously seeing how the network works when blocks start to be full. Wallets and network must solve the equation which they would anyway need to solve at some time. Better now than in the future.
Also, of recent blocks, many of them are "utxo cleaning" blocks. They fill the blocks with dust utxo sweeps which may at first look like there's lots of users but actually the block may be even more than 50% filled with high sized 50kB dust grouping (by pool.)

I actually do. Also, I agree that there are always compromises. My point was to highlight the fact that it's a good thing that Bitcoin developers aren't trading security to something else unless it's really worth it. Bitcoin works because of the strong crypto, availability, decentralization, code quality and so on. It all adds up into "security".
Much can be improved but pretty much nothing should be improved by weakening security. Improving through weakening security might be the easiest/fastest path but it's the worst after all.

Depends on the community. As we can see, people do not understand what is decentralization, and if they at some level did, they'd trade it away for quite a little. People all over the world use centralized systems even if decentralized / more fair systems were available. This is so, because unfairness hits only some smaller portion of users but trade-off gains like efficiency, cost savings etc. affect everyone. This is the world Bitcoin needs to live in. So it's pretty hard to say if that "community" would support centralization or decentralization or whatever trade-offs.. It has to be the other way around, and even then it's very tough. I'd guess that "root" of Bitcoin community would go after decentralization, at least. But weakening its security is just so juicy for so many..

2MB or 4MB blocks won't be very helpful if Bitcoin should support all the transactions in the world. But such would cause quite some damage to decentralization as the resource requirements increasing speed doubles or quadruples.
5x more users = 5MB blocks? What if we want to support 100x users? 100MB blocks?
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:36:19
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:16:43
Well, hard forking the block size to e.g. 2MB is not really very significant for Bitcoin users (in the future). Double the chain growing speed and allow double the tps. Former sounds bad and latter sounds insignificant. But tech will get better and 2MB will be treated like we treat 2KB now.
However, any hard fork means a total rule change and simply *everyone* agreeing on changing the rules. This weakens the system. Who knows what will happen in the future? The promise of Bitcoin (current rules) is broken / weaken when hard forks are done. Is 1MB-&gt;2MB worth it? I think not.

I don't think Bitcoin has really *faced* the block capacity cap. Fees are relatively low still. There's no real fight over the capacity (and there should be, because resources are not free!)
I think fungibility, *real* scalability (remember that block size cap is just a tool to manage the scaling problems!), keeping consensus (so no chain splits), miner centralization problems etc. are *way* more important than what the block size cap should be at. Common bitcoiners see the simplified versions of these issues. The bad thing is that these can't really be simplified - we're talking about extremely complex system.


You don't know what you're talking about if you think that we know everything about "the Nakamoto consensus" systems, or crypto currencies anyway.


Stupid lie. You make yourself look like an idiot by spreading shit like this. Anyone can understand the simplified version of Bitcoin, like yeah you have these private keys and bitcoin addresses etc. and you move money. Magic Internet money.
Start telling them about bit-wise synchronization issues, Internet structure and the bottlenecks &amp; problems with certain kind of communications over it, the Nakamoto consensus and how it really works, money-critical software development and the dangers of doing a mistake with it. Maybe tell them a bit about the used cryptography and the incentive model of Bitcoin. What keeps Bitcoin running? What keeps this system working in the future? What protections do Bitcoin have against e.g. governments?
Simply, Bitcoin is extremely complex system. It can't be understood by anyone without carefully educating oneself about it. The overall idea is quite simple to grasp, but that's *very* far from understanding Bitcoin.


Keep on throwing insults. I understand it's all you can really reply to me at this point. :)


You should really understand why software is ran in the first place. Then you might understand why Bitcoin system is not just simply only a technical system.

Well, I can answer my own question.
One team (or one guy) has done some research and analysis about the propagation times. Useful info.
One guy has rehashed an old idea. Turned out there was already a much better alternative*s* made, which he had missed because of not willing to collaborate with others. He made his work *appear* so "revolutionary", maybe to claim *some improvements* have been made. A nice try, though.
This is actually *everything* they've done. Oh, and they've copypasted Bitcoin Core and changed some variable names to "funny stuff", deleted some code and changed some variables.
Didn't "Classic" (or whatever they call it these days) already declare to simply copy-paste the work by Core devs and delete parts they don't like? This explains why they've not made any improvements by themselves.
The scalability-related code in Core exists for a reason. I'd question whether it's wise to just delete parts of it to "improve scalability."
That's it. Did I miss anything?

I think it's quite fair to say that Viabtc is blocking Segwit. They've announced that they won't support Segwit. They're a mining pool, and 95% of mining power needs to support Segwit for it to activate. Even though the actual network rule change signaling hasn't started yet, these off-channel announces are valid anyhow.
Segwit would bring &gt;70% increase in capacity, in ~1-2 months. Being against this means being against the capacity increase (this way). Segwit would also allow scaling via layers. So what are they looking for if not this heavily scalability related upgrade??
@_date: 2016-12-06 13:12:37


You're missing what I mean, big time. Core is good, other implementations are good. Forking Core or other implementations to change Bitcoin rules, then pushing those changes to everyone without having consensus - that's bad. See the difference between implementation and different rules.


Intentions may be good - who knows - but the outcome has been bad. BU idea is crap, simple. Other implementations are fine, but changing Bitcoin without consensus is not. In addition to that, BU also tries to change Bitcoins rules to crappy rules.


Bullshit. This kind of "facts" is what makes you and r/btc trolls.






They made a block size increase SegWit, how's that saying "we need 1mb limit"? Who are you talking about, anyway? Blockstream or Bitcoin Core, or someone else? Do you get that Blockstream is a company and Bitcoin Core is a *project* and there are tens or hundreds of contributors.. and so on. It's this bullshit narrative you and r/btc do, that Blockstream *is* Bitcoin Core. No wonder people ignore you (you &amp; r/btc) when you spread this level of crap.


I don't agree. Why do you think so?


Could be done in 4 weeks with SegWit. Why are some people refusing it - I also wonder that. Doesn't worry me, though. Bitcoin is working just fine, just like it has been since "URGENT! Blocksizes must increase" blog post by Gavin 1.5 years ago.


I linked you to one of these. It's not addressed by any "developer" of BU, because it's a fundamental problem of the idea. You're "sure" it's being tested succesfully? Well, **Bitcoin Core** contributors found a bunch of bugs from the code made by BU devs. Funny... Sad, actually.


OK. I disagree. 


No! Discussing ideas is welcome. Promoting implementations of alternative rules is *not*. See the difference between development idea and actual implementation that's being promoted.


Well, nobody is blocking ideas. Is this clear now?


Ideas are fine. Altcoin clients in Bitcoin subreddit are offtopic IMO.


Why are you supporting Bitcoin XT? (Dictator Hearn in charge of everything)
Why are you supporting Bitcoin Classic? (A handful of people in charge of everything)
Why are you supporting Bitcoin Unlimited? (A handful of people in charge of everything, letting miners to be in charge of the Bitcoin rules)
Think about it. Go to the sources of the information. You've spent so much time already, so why not just go directly to the root of the information. It's more time consuming but you get real information. Now you've spent a lot time spewing other peoples bullshit lies. You're sharing those lies around, essentially contributing to keep the misinformation alive.


This is how bitcointalk.org and r/bitcoin etc are and has always been. I think this should be quite clear to you already. 


No. This is one of those bullshit lies r/btc paid trolls keep on spreading, helped by non-paid users because they see this version of truth appealing to them. But, you can ask Gavin or whatever to find out that Gavin simply stopped contributing - that's it. No drama involved.

It's possible. Pools could even just tell to the world that they're supporting SegWit. They can mark whatever bits they want in their blocks - and they can say that those bits mark their support for SegWit.
Apparently now some pools have assigned the coming SW indicator bit to signal it already, before the "official" signaling begins. It's pretty straightforward to me. The signaling has meaning, even though it's happening before it "counts" network rules -wise.

The thing is that they're still complaining after doing nothing to help the development. Maybe the problems would be solved faster if they contributed. Many of the problems need lots of analyzing etc. There's lots of stuff to be tested and analyzed. For example, Circle could've helped testing &amp; developing SegWit but they did not. They could do *something* but they haven't.

Also, try to understand that the whole block size issue is a gimmick in itself. There are numerous much more important things to be improved. Focusing on block sizes is naive.

Feel free to ask me to elaborate.


Bullshit. There's nothing to indicate that they would be seeking to profit off bitcoin transactions.


It's disingenuous to claim that Blockstream hired core devs while those core devs *founded* Blockstream.


Nobody is censoring discussions about higher blocksize. That's just bullshit again.


Wait a second - you're contradicting even yourself here. What is SegWit again - not a block size limit you say? Well, why are SegWit blocks bigger than 1MB? Who's refusing to raise the limit again? *Nobody.*

I don't think that he did it *only* for the publicity. My point is that $25k for him is the same as $25 for some middle-class worker.
You know he buys publicity, right? He allegedly bought a subreddit (which now promotes his agenda and silences others), he bought bitcoin.com (which promotes his agenda and suppresses others), he pays many people to work for him (e.g. trolling, spreading misinformation, attacking people/companies Roger doesn't like etc.) He pays good money for this media &amp; propaganda machine. I wouldn't be surprised to learn some nasty things about the reasons behind this donation.
(Btw, you must now be thinking that I'm just speculating.. Well, check out /u/ MagmaHindenburg - one of the Vers paid staff - and his Segwit/Core slandering campaign. Poor opsec revealed his sockpuppets and now we're left wondering if Ver actually paid this guy to do the attacks against Bitcoin Core devs &amp; SegWit etc., or if it was just a coincidence)

His forum (r/Btc) is much more censored than r/Bitcoin, if that's what you're talking about.
In addition to that, they actually do ban users. E.g. they banned me. They also sticky very opinionated stuff, usually simply misinformation or otherwise disingenuous text. People with opinions against the r/btc agenda are restricted in their ability to speak. But they do allow shitposting. This may make it look like uncensored, but it's hiding the truth quite well. So, is this "uncensored" to you?

Some Bitcoin developers *formed* Blockstream company. Why do you think that they are controlling Bitcoin Core? This is one of those r/btc conspiracy theories... Bitcoin Core, the open source project, is *not* controlled by Blockstream. So, a lie.


No they didn't. There are lots of Core project devs and they as one did not promise anything. It's quite a big group of people.
If you're talking about the occasion where two Bitcoin Core contributors were locked in a room before they would agree on to something...
That's not "Core devs promising a blocksize hard fork". So, a lie again.


They can upgrade to use SegWit whenever they want to. This is not a hard fork. They can implement or choose to not implement SegWit if they want. SegWit is not a breaking change to Bitcoin because it's *optional*. So, a lie again.


Lightning Network is simply a name for an idea where Bitcoin transactions are used in a new way - a way which allows off-bandwidth transactions to happen. This doesn't alter the Bitcoin idea at all. Lightning Network uses Bitcoin and makes Bitcoin transactions; all which are totally valid to be also included in to the blockchain. The idea of Lightning Network is that not everything has to be written in to the blockchain; therefore reducing the technical costs to use Bitcoin.
Lightning Network is implemented in over five different public separate code bases. E.g.    etc.
So, Lightning Network implementations exist and actually You can test Lightning network already in the Bitcoin testnet. It's working quite well! So, you're lying again!


Lightning Network is an idea; which wasn't even made by Blockstream by the way. It's completely an open source idea, implementations are open source too, how could anyone charge you to use it? Can people charge you to use Bitcoin? WTF? Again I repeat: Lightning Network consists of Bitcoin contracts (between peers) and of methods to mix these contracts. This is completely decentralized, so where's the gatekeeper taking fees?
So, a lie again. 




It increases effective maximum blocksize, just like I said. SegWit is not mainly meant to be a blocksize increase, but it includes it anyway. There's no such thing as "ultimate scaling solution".


I mean SegWit.


It far from urgent. Remember how Gavin Andresen said about 1.5 years ago that blocks are full and it's urgent to increase the limits? Doesn't seem like urgent to me. TX fees are skyrocketing?  I don't see fees to be skyrocketing at $0.10 per typical transaction. Blocks are full? That's how it's meant to be!


Yeah, really simple and clean. Those 8MB blocks would've broken Bitcoin, as has been analyzed afterwards. It was wise to not be a fool. You lied again.
Trolls are spreading these lies you just told me. Do you want to educate yourself or do you want to be one of those trolls? Go to the root of the information and educate yourself - don't listen to others. Be critical and don't be naive. The only way to not be fooled is to use your brains instead of letting someone else do that for you.

He's doing some nasty stuff regardless. E.g. he actually loves to do censorship when it benefits him. Just check out the r/btc situation; how they handle those whose opinions are shut down by manipulators (w/ bots and so on). Shortly: When someone gets enough downvotes, Reddit places a 10 minutes timeout between posts. This means that you can do a maximum of 5 posts per hour, given that you post exactly every 10 minutes. This means e.g. that you have to waste 20 minutes to post 3 messages, because there are 10 minute timeouts. This feature is made by Reddit to control spam bots. Reddit admins encourage subreddit admins to fix this issue to all legit users by adding them to subreddit whitelist. Whitelisting does nothing else than removes this restriction for those who are affected by it.
Many have asked them to do what Reddit admins suggest. They refuse. They simply say "hey, this is Reddit feature." They acknowledge that they're actively placing people in two categories: those whose opinions are allowed and those whose opinions are not. Latter gets the restriction and therefore less visibility in the subreddit. Seriously who wants to look at the clock all the time to post again? Meanwhile shills post 100 messages spreading misinformation, pure lies etc - and there's *nothing* you can do about it. You can correct a maximum of *one* post, then you're again timeouted for 10 minutes. Effectively people with "wrong opinions" get frustrated and close the browser. Roger Ver and his mod team completely understands this and they do this on purpose. They call it moderation, but it's actually censorship. Say what Roger wants to hear and you can speak freely. Say what Roger doesn't want to hear, and you may speak sometimes.

Probably, but this is not about the scaling debate. All the professionals already agree on that SegWit is the path forward. There's no consensus about what happens after that re: scaling. But SegWit has nearly unanimous support among the experts.
r/btc is *not* "the other side" of the scaling debate. r/btc is the land of trolls. There's this side who want everyone to choose their own blocksizes, but this idea has been analyzed to be extremely stupid a long time ago. In addition to Bitcoin Unlimited being coded poorly (99% of the code is from Bitcoin Core, the rest is poorly implemented by them), "let's let miners choose everything" is a bad idea.

 &gt;we also want on-chain scaling ( bigger blocks ) 
It's that people are being fooled that bigger blocks would somehow be a proper solution to anything. It's not. It won't solve the major questions re: scaling. But, bigger blocks do kick the can which itself is a fine *short-term* solution. SegWit does exactly this. Increasing blocksizes is *very* risky business, for many many reasons. Manipulators make it sound like it's stupidly simple and should be done of course. But they don't tell you about the big picture: What it really means to increase the block sizes anyway!
Let me tell you what it means to me:
1) Less people can run full nodes, because 1) verification gets harder (takes longer time, and this only escalates as all the new peers must download and validate the whole history). 2) Downloading and sharing the blockchain eats more resources - again the speed the resource requirements increase increases. This could be very bad long-term. We don't simply know how the networks, CPUs etc evolve. Bitcoin is primarily meant to enable monetary sovereignty for everyone. This simply means running (or being able to run) an own full node, nothing less. This is decentralization: the one key aspect of Bitcoin that should be taken care very very closely. Can we afford to make Bitcoin less decentralized? Decentralization is extremely hard to measure. But even today we know that many don't run their own full nodes because it's too expensive / hard / has too many downsides to be worth it for them. The key thing here is that people can run a 100% equal-to-others full node, if they want to.
2) Fees will be lower, probably. How much are the fees today anyway? 5-20 cents. I think they could be *a lot* more. Why? Each transaction is stored/validated/downloaded/shared by all nodes. And this is not a one-time cost - it's repeated every time a new node joins the network. Someone has to upload the transaction, someone has to download and validate it. They don't get anything for doing this. The transaction might be e.g. someone sending a half dollar to someone (so not very significant). This transaction is secured by thousands or tens of thousands of computers around the world; now and for many years to come. Each transaction increases the resource requirements to be part of this Bitcoin network. Increased resource requirements means less people can be part of the network. But by increasing the resource requirements growth speed (= increasing block sizes), more people can *use* the network because of more capacity (and also lower fees because of the increased capacity).
So, now the question is; which is more important? Possibility to validate the system or use the system? I'd choose to validate the system. But it's a tough question as both are important. But one has to remember that Bitcoin is based on the fact that "everyone" can validate everything. For those who don't appreciate that, there exists services e.g. Paypal. And "everyone" can use Paypal!
3) To combat the consequences of low capacity, we need methods to leverage whatever capacity the user gets. Or in other words, layerization. There must be some ways to use the capacity for more than just simple one-time value transfers. And luckily there are!! E.g. Lightning network is an excellent attempt to leverage the power of decentralized ledger and Bitcoins scripting system.
Now when the layerization is relatively near, and a small (well, &gt;70%) capacity increase is being (hopefully) enabled soon, why should we worry too much about increasing the block sizes again? The cost to use Bitcoin is currently very low (the money you need to pay to the miners), and in many cases that cost is already lower than the cost to validate the system. The "technical" costs are paid by nodes (common people who want monetary sovereignty) - and they don't collect the transaction fees.

Btw, also the transaction history would be leaked.

Thanks, good reply.


Downlink is a whole different thing than uplink. Uplink is one of the bottlenecks for Bitcoin. We've not actually seen too much improvement here, globally. Hopefully we'll see those Gbps/Tbps links covering the whole world in 15 years - but I doubt it. Max 144MB growth rate per day is quite sane for todays global state of Internet connectivity. One could argue that it's even too much, even more so when you see the low fees. (And yes they're low for the received security etc. - but this is not really something we should argue about :) )
I think 1-2 MB block size limit is super fine for now. I've heard some bad reports from people who've run *very new* altcoins which implement e.g. no limits on block sizes or too high limits. Even western, rich people, are struggling with syncing &amp; running full nodes for these altcoins. Try some of them! E.g. Ethereum syncing is PITA. According to  Ethereum requires 75 GB of space today! That's *insane* growth rate. And the transactions are much more costly (slower) to validate than Bitcoin transactions. But, try it for yourself.
Also, we don't want Bitcoin to become like PGP - a very good system which nobody really uses because it's so hard to use. Running a fully validating node should be relatively easy. We'll see how the tech evolves.

The narrative is still that "make Bitcoin great again" (by making transactions cheaper and trashing decentralization). Because who cares about decentralization when you can send $1 for $0.005 fee?
It was, and still is, a common idea (among some people) that Bitcoin will be valued *lower* because the blockchain is a scarce resource. I disagree with this, because I think Bitcoin system value comes exactly from its unique aspects; immutability, decentralization, storage of value. Internet gold (but better than gold). These values should be protected. Bigger blocks hurt decentralization which in turn makes Bitcoin more vulnerable to manipulation and so on.

Great. Too many people think that the block size problem is the biggest and most important problem ever.


When were you coding Bitcoin? How is this relevant anyway?
Much of how it works is still dark to everyone, btw. We're getting more and more information all the time. Bitcoin is not just purely technical, which makes it extremely complex and hard to predict system.


Will they grow forever? Even if they do, there are still lots and lots of people who don't have access to resources to run a node - even today!


Irrelevant. It's a centralized server serving these websites. Bitcoin is not a centralized service. E.g. your home connection couldn't be used to serve people these 2MB websites. Consider 10 different people accessing your website the same time; requires 160Mbit/s upload connection. Do you have 160 Mbps upload?

Those few devs against Core project simply disappeared after working on "XT" and "Classic"?
Do some background check for a few of those members of that, apparently, a troll project. E.g. Andrew Quentson &amp; cypherdoc. The BU project may have some legit people around, but some of those guys want to destroy Bitcoin. Funny how r/buttcoin contributors have now moved into this BU project "to help Bitcoin". :D
I really suggest that you read the Bitcoin whitepaper and try to understand why "Bitcoin Unlimited" is bad. But, this has nothing to do with the fact that "Bitcoin Classic" "devs" moved into "Bitcoin Unlimited" after the power grabbing attempt failed. First of these three ("XT") openly admitted the will to have 100% control of everything; second was just a power grabbing attempt which were "uncontroversial enough" so "everyone should accept it", this 2MB block size HF that is. Now this third attempt ("BU") is kind of "OK lets' then trash Bitcoin - we couldn't get the power we wanted!". Just read up the Bitcoin whitepaper and see why BU a bad idea. Let me tell you that many of those working for BU understand that it's not good for Bitcoin; not to forget that many also work in good faith.

Actually Lightning is working already in the testnet. And in the mainnet too (but not very well due to malleability risks). Malleability is fixed with SegWit, so we now just need to get it in the mainnet to use Lightning in the mainnet.

I think it's good that people work on Bitcoin related stuff, e.g. BU.
But, they do poor quality code and are not willing to listen to other developers who are truly experts in this field after working on these things for years and years. Also, some people are using this BU thing as a tool in their power grab attempts.
But, it's good that people do something. I am sure most people supporting BU have good intentions.

Why are BU crew not willing to test their ideas first on an altcoin? Why push this ridiculous badly implemented very fragile and untested functionality into 
Bitcoin mainnet? It's simply extremely stupid thing to do.


I don't know where you see those personal attacks you mentioned. I think I clarified what was seemingly nonsense.
About division.. When you have a group who are willing to do 1) Bitcoin XT to hard fork to 8MB-&gt;8GB blocks, which failed.. then 2) Bitcoin Classic (which is simply a hard fork to 2MB blocks)... which failed and then 3) blocking SegWit (which would be ~2MB soft-fork) and promoting utter garbage (see earlier posts) BU ruleset.. Do you think they're seeking to *not* divide the community further? SegWit is literally bringing them that capacity increase they so much (seemingly) wish, but they reject it. After all, it should be obvious to everyone following it that it never was about Bitcoin block sizes or capacity anyway. It's about division and control of Bitcoin. Divide &amp; Conquer, remember. There are so many entities which would really love to kill Bitcoin - and many of those are filthy rich. Now you think that's conspiracy? I am just saying that there are numerous entities loaded with money who wish that Bitcoin never existed.
How can one really kill Bitcoin then? By dividing the community. How can one divide the community? Well, there are lots of guides about this - many of them are leaks from 3-letter agencies. They're not new in this business. Manipulation is doable and done. In the Bitcoin scene? Probably. Trust the code, reject the politics and nonsense. Code is the important thing. But in reality a working community is actually also very important, even for Bitcoin. The community should identify what's important and good, and what's not. Go to the sources of information - don't settle for the already digested version (which is always colored).


Bitcoin Unlimited implementation is being pushed around without consensus. We can discuss the idea but we shouldn't push people to use consensus-less version of Bitcoin rules (= altcoin). Discussing the idea is very different from promoting the implementation of it.
Anyway, the BU idea is simply bad in so many ways. For some discussion about the BU problems, check out 


You're free to do whatever you want. But don't expect others to do what you want. Bitcoin is quite well defined and the free market will never change what Bitcoin is. You simply can't change the definition of Bitcoin like that.
Who are the experts? People who are maintaining Bitcoin. People who know Bitcoin extremely deeply. People who are developing Bitcoin further. We can be pretty certain that they understand the Bitcoin code the best - at least after they carefully explain everything. After this it is up to the people to listen or not to listen. You can then judge if you think what they're doing is best for all parties involved, or not. You can of course also always fork as it's open source completely. Do you have a suggestion for alternative governance model? Bitcoin XT had this new "Hearn dictates" idea, would you have preferred? Bitcoin Core has 100+ contributors - it's an open project for anyone. Contribute and your voice will be heard. Or would you like "Bitcoin Classic" governance model where a handful of guys choose what happens? Or how about BU model where miners choose who can run Bitcoin and a handful of guys "maintain" the codebase?
Just think about it. Think about the options and why things work as they do right now. Check out how Bitcoin Core project is governed. All this information is available in the Github repo.

Roger pays people to spread propaganda to the miners - and he of course does it himself too. He has lots of money, and now he's attempting to gain some power for that money. This is why he has his own media sites, all promoting *his* choices. This is why he has his own mining pool - to have more power.
All this "r/Bitcoin is censored" etc is bullshit and he knows it very well. At one point I thought he does everything with good intent; now I am not so sure anymore. So many people have tried to talk to him, so it really is now looking more like a power grabbing attempt. People with money do have influence on Bitcoin.

Are you saying XT supporters *know* XT solutions aren't the way to go but just want to speed up the development of scalability-related solutions in Bitcoin? That is not how it's being marketed here at Reddit.
It is a known fact that real solutions to the scalability issues must be developed and increasing the blocksize isn't a real solution, though it will be necessary most likely anyway. What increasing the blocksize limit may actually cause right now, is slowing down the development of real solutions. The can can always be kicked further - until we've hit the point where we can only wave goodbye to decentralization. In the other hand it may very well be so that the real solutions will be developed faster now when there's a real threat (to Bitcoin) around. But can we really demand faster development for a project like this...
Of course we can always fallback to another cryptocurrency but I hope everyone wants to keep Bitcoin alive and do responsible adjustments to the code.
If XT gained much traction, to me it would signal about the weakness of Bitcoin. Bad code adjustments could be done just like that and the support could be achieved just like that, without caring about the technical problems or proper development process.

Even though Lightning hubs are centralized, you **dont need to trust them really.** What they can do is not process your transactions or they can lock up your funds for a while. If they do this, you can use another Lightning hub. No money were lost. If all your money were locked up in this bad behaving hub, I'm sure someone will make a market to trade these locked funds for non-locked funds.
It's silly to say Lightning hubs are like using Paypal. When you use Paypal, you need to *trust* Paypal in all ways. With Lightning, the hubs cannot steal or keep your funds (except for the relatively small lock-up time, and as I said earlier, you will be able to exchange the locked funds for non-locked funds if that happens.)
Lightning enables transactions which aren't really possibly right now in the Bitcoin network. It's silly to store 5 cent transactions in all full nodes, in the blockchain. It's a huge waste of space, agreed?
Instead, you can sum these small transactions and only do the clearing in the blockchain. For the end user, there's not much difference - except that the users will be able to do trustless micropayments and get those confirmed immediately, among other cool things.
Maybe in the future there'll be plenty of bandwidth, storage and CPU power to process every single, even tiny payment in the main network and store it in every computer doing the validation and storing of blockchain. But that's not very realistic right now - Lightning is.

Well, there are no direct/"enforced" ties between bitcoins and real-world identities. All the money and transactions can be seen by anyone by looking at the blockchain. Transactions' traceability can be limited to the system itself. So you can acquire bitcoins anonymously and spend them anonymously, it just requires lots of effort and knowledge.
Monero only (partially) solves problems of the system-level traceability. In/outramps are main information leaks for both Bitcoin and Monero.

Wrong. You're actually censoring yourself here with your fixing of every Bitcoin XT mention. LOL.
The sidebar says: &gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

Although, as I said several times and now second time in this single post: **I also agree that deleting the threads wasn't a good thing to do but I do understand why it was done, so me not agreeing the deleting is just my opinion and not something that everyone should agree on.** As I explained, the deletion of those threads can very well be seen as normal moderation as the discussion was about Bitcoin-XT (the non-consensus based rule-altering protocol fork), not Bitcoin as we currently know it.

BIP101 were discussed - I didn't claim otherwise so please don't state so. BIP101 still needs more analyzing and analysis about the side effects, mainly the effects caused to decentralization of Bitcoin. The key thing in Bitcoin is decentralization (being trustless system actually.) Fast and/or cheap transactions are not as big priority as to keep the system trustless. If they were, you could use an alternative like Paypal or crypto currency -boosted (but at least privileged ledger) systems like Ripple or Stellar.
I'll just say: Think about how these kind of systems should be developed. Which know better, users or the developers? Would Bitcoin really be this good if excellent PR skills could change the protocol? I'm also pretty confident everything will be fine. XT as I see it just won't be accepted. note: BIP101 =/= XT.
Though; I am against the censoring too. You just can't censor anything, really. It could've still been seen as normal moderating. There were quite a lot discussions about Bitcoin-XT, even to the point of it getting super noisy and non-constructive.

@_date: 2015-08-19 17:02:09
Actually a lot of it is based on the tech available. We could have a "datacenter full nodes only" -network, it would still be hugely better than Paypal or such. That is a bit like surrendering to give up on the decentralization. It's definitely possible to scale up without losing decentralization - why rush with the scaling approaches which lose decentralization, add extra risks to this whole project and are hard to undo? And still it wouldn't be real scaling up solution.
@_date: 2015-08-30 10:57:19
You need to know what Bitcoin is to comment things about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not your usual internet protocol. Being a PhD possibly makes it a lot easier to learn, though.
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:13:30
A lot of people apparently do fail to understand the key factor of Bitcoin and how important it is to preserve it. Bitcoin being trustless, decentralized. And the "solution" to the scaling problem isn't even a real solution. Increasing transactions/block is only one step needed to get real scaling. A lot of analysis and planning must be done before even trying to push something like BIP101 to the protocol, there's no hurry here. Currently it's known that it will hurt the decentralization.
There are lots of great things being developed, many to solve the scaling problem, one of them being Lightning. Maybe blocks propagation problem will be also solved, then bigger blocks wouldn't hurt, possibly at all, the decentralization.
People undervalue the importance of preserving the decentralization. And it's already kind of struggling and needs new tech to be great.
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:54:10
Discussed but still no consensus about how to deal with it. Solution? Implement it.. OR Think about some other kind of solution which wouldn't hurt the consensus. If BIP101 - which isn't even 2 years old - were discussed for 2 years already, why are there no proper analysis or anything like that about it and/or the effects it causes to Bitcoin (mainly it's decentralization)?
When the devs disagree, there's often (always) a proper technical reason behind it. It's really not about their opinions when it comes to consensus questions.


You don't apparently understand how Bitcoin works, based on this statement of yours. The development process of the protocol is peer reviewed and consensus based - there will be no rushing with that kind of very fragile and serious thing. Altcoins can test out new things if they want to - why risk the big thing with that kind of stupidity?


Maybe it should then be made more clear that Bitcoin *is* about being decentralized and trustless and if someone wants just free/cheap and fast (micro)transactions etc, he can seek for other kinds of solutions. Maybe Paypal would be sufficient?
Of course you can make a hostile fork to push your not-yet-accepted BIP. Tell to people about it and tell them that they will be able to move more money in the network when they adapt it. There will be no big problems and decentralization will be just fine. Right?
Right. Lots of people will never agree with that kind of thing. First of all, hostile forking is the worst ever way to change the protocol. No way that should be supported, unless current development process of Bitcoin protocol was in deep shit. And it's not, it's working very well.
If people and miners really start to adopt the XT, then we will split, at least with the silly 75% of mined blocks thingie which is the worst possible number to be there. Two chains with different purposes.
Go on with your fast and cheap transactions, forget the decentralization part and the boring technical bla bla. You're the user, you're in charge.

The progress has been ongoing all the time. It's not like you can speed up the development this way. There's multiple things being developed and some are very far in the development too, actually. So it's very insulting to say bitcoin devs are not doing anything re: scalability. It just happens to be so that Gavins solution proposition got rejected and he still insisted on pushing it through. It tells a lot about the mentality and how much he really knows about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:41:59
Changing the blocksize (as Gavin proposed) as a scalability issue solution/fix (at any level) isn't very good or worth the risk, as was determined by the BIP process of careful examination of the proposal.
This means that while the blocksize increase could work, it's not a proper way to deal with the *real* scalability issue. If you want to do fast and cheap transactions, use Paypal. If you want to do fast and cheap transactions and keep the idea of Bitcoin, you have to do things quite a lot differently. Adding more transactions to the core network, right now, before things are ready for that, is most likely not going to work well. And even if increasing the blocksize was a good thing to do right now, Gavin has been pushing it in a very harmful way. Maybe it'll end up being a good thing in the end, who knows.
Everyone would agree to increase the blocksize limit if it didn't have the consequences!

Denying transactions will pretty soon drive users away from the hub which does that. When funds get frozen in Lightning system, you can be perfectly certain the funds are not lost and you will get them back soon. You will also know when you get the funds back.
With Paypal they may be silent for days or weeks and you may never see your money again if they choose to do so.
The Lightning system relies on Bitcoin - you'll still be using the Bitcoin protocol but you're just not wasting everyones resources with the small and all the time moving all-day payments. The whole world doesn't need to store your coffee purchase transaction.

It's very easy to spread tons of misinformation. It's very hard to refute tons of misinformation.
But, this time.. I'll counter some of the easiest and most obvious lies in your post:


Core is the only project (of these full node software which most are copy of Core) so far which has actually done scalability upgrades. These other "projects" are trolls or otherwise bad. "We changed this and that and now it scales better!!" Yeah, sure, many n00bs will fall for that!


Thanks to Core project (its many developers), Bitcoin is successful. About Blockstream: You blame Blockstream because... they've produced you code to use for free? Heh.


Segwit increased blocks. How does that prove they want small blocks? Why would anyone want high fees or slow confirmations? You're proving you're out of your mind. Too much RV bwashing? What off-chain products do Blockstream sell? Lightning Network? Lightning is not theirs and is not even a product. It's a protocol. Think about your claims if you're able to do it.
Simply put, you have zero clue about what you're talking about. You're free to believe otherwise, but then again you'd be wrong.

Obviously it's dangerous to push protocol changes without consensus. Here we are seeing absolutely no sight of even a small consensus. Instead, we're seeing great consensus on the opposite side: about everyone else (of devs, the people who know about these things) is against the BIP101. That may of course change (when research and analysis is done) but it is what it is now. We're talking about the rules of Bitcoin and we all need to accept those rules to use Bitcoin. You can't just change the rules just like that and push it to people. Or well, you can but that is dangerous and irresponsible. Not to even mention why you pick such a bad proportion as 75% to "indicate a consensus" among miners... For many this is a serious project.
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:26:30
Indeed - but the reality starts to hit here. Is there enough power in the Bitcoin to be able to handle the micropayments without a Lightning-type level? I say not, at least not yet. Let me repeat myself: *Maybe in the future there'll be plenty of bandwidth, storage and CPU power to process every single, even tiny payment in the main network and store it in every computer doing the validation and storing of blockchain. But that's not very realistic right now - Lightning is.*
No matter how hard you wish we had the resources to enable all the good things right now, we don't. Of course you can sacrifice the idea of Bitcoin and start using Paypal. Or if you want to use a cryptocurrency-boosted privileged ledger system, try Stellar or Ripple. Of course Bitcoin aims to be able to work as well as possible but the decentralization is the priority, it must be protected. People are all the time working on solutions to these problems. Some rushed solutions may work fine but may eventually turn to be bad and non-undoable actions. It's still not responsible to do rushed decisions with Bitcoin.

It is *not* censorship. It's moderation. You're absolutely free to discuss off-topic somewhere where it's on-topic. This is not rocket science, but I can see that it's easy to fall for that "ohh, you remove posts? that IS censorship then!!" -thinking. Think about the options. Manipulating Reddit (and other social media) is quite doable and here Reddit admins acknowledge the problem of course too. Why don't you acknowledge it?

There are other forums for altcoins. However, I agree that when e.g. some altcoin gives free value/tokens/whatever to Bitcoin owners, it's really relevant for bitcoiners too. But then again, it's altcoin stuff which is not on-topic here. How much relation between some altcoin and Bitcoin is enough to make it on-topic here?

The core devs are saying Bitcoin can't handle bigger blocks yet. This does NOT MEAN they do not WANT bigger blocks. They just say it's not the right time to increase it (even if it was Jan 2016). Basically they and the majority of bitcoin users are against XT - because it's plainly silly, very risky.. most likely won't work very well (Bitcoin with the 1MB blocks is having enough problems already.) So it's just tearing down the consensus here, right now, right?
Of course everyone wants these new cool things like 0-confs, bigger blocks, cheaper transactions. It's not about that (though that is how XT is being crammed through the throaths of redditors.)

"Devs refusing to address the most basic level scalability issues" - man you need to do some research before stating insulting nonsense like this. Do you have any idea of the amount of work being done on this? For example, start by looking at  or  etc, LN being one of the newest.
You're stating very insulting lies about the Bitcoin developers. When you say "core devs have to wake up and start acting responsibly" what do you think they're doing when they do not accept XT patches committed while XT patches were only accepted by 2 out of 20 or so devs?

They are actually developing the Bitcoin, not just the one implementation called Bitcoin Core. They may obviously not be forever correct but so far they've proven to know what they're doing. Nobody said they're perfect.
They're group of people who develop Bitcoin - just like Gavin and Hearn. Gavin and Hearn are Bitcoin developers too, people tend to forget this. The thing here is that out of the great amount of Bitcoin developers, there are two (Gavin and Hearn) who wanted to proceed with patches which didn't gain consensus or anything even near to that among the Bitcoin developers. (Now said patches are implemented in Bitcoin-XT)
Do you seriously think that the (usual, common man) community knows better than the people who have dedicated much of their time to gain knowledge of this system to be able to develop it further? The devs are also part of the community, obviously. And not just the devs are against XT, the great majority of known Bitcoin professionals are against it too.
If you want Bitcoin to be here for more than the average lifetime, why rush with such stuff like XT?

It's a lot better than it was when every topic were about Bitcoin-XT - and it was even worse when the moderation stopped completely. Do you really think people would learn to do good choices in that kind of environment? Drama seekers probably enjoy that hugely.
Also, about XT being an altcoin.. Maybe they say so because XT refused to go through / honor BITCOIN improvement proposals and instead wanted to rush the changes to the protocol. It's obvious that a system like Bitcoin can't be developed or maintained like that. Maybe altcoins can be used for tests and rushed patches.

It's technically a lot worse (if miners start producing big blocks, shit will hit the fan pretty soon.) Do some research. Things need to be developed and consensus must be reached before such sw.

Hardforks or chain splits or whatever are just fine to be discussed here as long as you don't claim it's Bitcoin. It's not Bitcoin unless current Bitcoin users agree on that it's Bitcoin. Hardforking (=replacing) Bitcoin requires consensus. Simple.
And if there's no consensus, the said hard fork ends up being an altcoin (or non-existent.) And altcoins are off-topic here. If they were on-topic, the amount of noise would be ridiculous.

The Y attribute is the key. If it means "Year", then it probably hints about the tank, eq. btc/usd free fall of 2011. Flooding the floor etc probs means blood in the streets, obviously. Therefore if it's "year" it simply means another tank. If it means Y axle, it means rocket. Simple? Deja vu in both cases since we've seen huge rallys and huge tanking. 
But i'd say "change the Y attribute" sounds more like it means "Year". Another tanking coming? =) 
What I think this riddle tries to say: Bitcoin has been dumped heavily on markets, been a long bear market while eq. Stolen Goxfunds are being dumped. This kind of things has happened before, when Bitcoin was small. 2011 it was all "Gox's fault" (at least when they got hacked and bitcoin value went to 0, heh)

Not really. As long as you can run a node you can verify nobody is taking over Bitcoin.
This is all about the *possibility* to run a node if one wants to. Making it harder to run the node now and in the future because of *very* short-term gains is just not good option. Bitcoin is currently very cheap to use. But as we know, not everyone wants Bitcoin to be ultra secure and would be willing to do trade-offs. But there's always huge amount of users who use Bitcoin specifically because of the heavy decentralization. This means Bitcoin either stays as it is as of today or it scales via layers (or some other method.)

Well, I don't consider the money received until it has 1-6 confirmations. Some may consider unconfirmed as received. Some may even consider non-broadcasted signed/unsigned transactions as received!
And this **opt-in** feature only affects **policy** of the nodes how they treat **unconfirmed (0-conf)** transactions which signal they wish to be replaceable **in the unconfirmed state.**
When transaction is in a block, it is in a block and therefore part of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:00:33
The problem here is that *every full node* needs to carry the weight. Not everyone can carry the same amount of weight. When the growing speed increases, Bitcoins peer-to-peerness aka decentralization on the network level weakens.
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:26:42
Could work. Small groups of people could pool in money to share a full node. It just requires trust, but that should not be a problem in such groups.
My point is that people run full nodes *for self*, to be able to verify things, not to primarily serve others. Also having all the transactions is the only way to check *yours* without revealing which transactions you want to check.

I'd say it's better to have as many options as possible. It is possible to extend the system further for different needs. Everything must be based on the *really* decentralized root network because you can't extend to more decentralized systems on top of that. You obviously do not need or want to run a node yourself, but many do. But on the other hand not everyone can run a node even today. So how much is too much and how low is too low.
And on the other hand we know that the blockchain can't work for everyone even if the blocksizes increased 10 fold. That would allow maybe 10-15 fold more users than as of today. And it would drop huge amount of people out of the *peer-to-peer, supposed-to-be-decentralized* network. Bitcoin should target to be working for 100% of the people, not any lower. Bitcoins key properties are *not* fast or cheap transactions. It's all about security, since always. Internet cash is not Internet cash any other way.

We're talking about *technology* here. Bitcoin scalability is entirely technological issue itself. Leave solving it to those who know what they're doing, really. This doesn't mean he should be quiet.
The big non-technological question is how big share of the (potential) Bitcoin users should have the ability to verify &amp; be part of the network in full, if they wish to do so. This means running full node. Obviously there are trade-offs to be done re: this question, or we wouldn't even be discussing this.

No, there are critical differences.


Internet doesn't *rely* on DNS. Also, we have some other services like the Tor which has its very own domain name system.
Internet is just way to share information which is and should be easily copyable. Just like libraries etc. used to do, but way more ineffectively.
And there is lots of fake information in the Internet.


Bitcoin is first of its kind. You can't extend Bitcoin to more decentralized systems because they would rely on the less decentralized system. We're talking about technical security.

Seed is the root of the bitcoin keys you have in Trezor. This means you will lose everything if you lose the seed. Optional password acts as an extra word in the seed, but it can be pretty easy to brute-force when you know the seed.

I suggest you use a wallet which supports "coin control", so you can specify which coins are sent together and which are not. One good option would be to run Bitcoin Core and Electrum server and then use Electrum w/ own server with coin control and multiple wallets.

Propagating nodes choose what the validating-only nodes get. Therefore, validating-only nodes are not 100% equal-to-others. This means that they are not *full* nodes.

Bitcoin is in that kind of state right now. Bitcoin has many properties.. Right now its valuation is a top talking topic as it's fluctuating heavily after a massive bull run. It's only natural, and valuation is very important aspect of Bitcoin. And not everyone is talking about how much money they might lose. Worst case is only -100%...
Bitcoin being deflationary, it works as a "savings account" and is used as such by many. Bitcoin was never about "spend spend spend" like fiat systems are. That's a crucial difference: inflationary fiat systems encourage to spend while deflationary Bitcoin encourages saving. Saving is much more healthy than mindless spending just for the sake of it, anyway. It would be unfair to say that spending is or should be the primary use for Bitcoin. Historical usage of Bitcoin, even when it was inconvenient, made the word spread. These days that (spreading the word) is not needed in the same way.
Bitcoin is best spent when it's (or has a chance to get to be) the most convenient way to send money to whoever you're sending money to. Bitcoin has various properties that makes it excel in some use cases while not excelling in some others. E.g. accepting money via Bitcoin is the most risk-free method (at least for me).

Notice that this is extremely bad for your (and others who you've transacted with) privacy. By giving your xpub to the site, it reveals all the history of your transactions, current state and all future transactions of your wallet.
If you want to derive paths from your xpubkey, the non-harming way for privacy is to use local tools for that. For example ku (key utility) tool available at  can do it, and it's easy to use. The tool also supports various other sorts of things, like conversions between formats etc. But as always, use it at your own risk.

If you create a specific address for this purpose, and will not receive any coins in it from any other source, and will not spend coins received to this address with other coins, it will most likely not de-anonymize you.
Also, you need to be careful when/where you request info about your wallet (where this address lies), if you use a non-full client. For example checking the address via public blockchain explorers reveals the possible link between the requester (IP, browser etc.) and the address.

Do you have to be a cryptography, (decentralized) networking &amp; computer expert to use Bitcoin or the browser, or anything?
Also, to use LN you don't have to be always connected. Because LN uses contract between you and someone else, you are responsible for taking care of it. Unless you hire someone to watch it for you (or someone does it for free for you.) You don't have to be always connected, but you have to periodically go see and verify that things are as your contract says. Btw, if the other party of your contract is trying to steal your money, Bitcoin blockchain ("the judge") can be used to punish him (as is written in the contract you both agreed to) which makes you get all his money from the contract. So there's no incentive to try to steal others money, as it only requires you (or someone else who watches the contract for you) to be online and see that such attempt is tried.

This message would need a huge audience and real actions by so many holders of the community. E.g. Coinbase is [currently holding]( at least 5% of all bitcoins and similarly huge portions of other coins (like 25% of *all* LTC).
It's easy to let others take care of storing your bitcoins, but if you're into the ideas behind Bitcoin it's worth it to educate yourself enough to be able to securely hold your bitcoins yourself.

Total valuation should IMO count all non-circulating and circulating tokens, even though it tells very little about reality like real liquidity or circulation etc..

That's one definition of investing. I think that's too restricting, though. By dropping the "static" value meter (=e.g. USD), it opens up a whole new investing world. By your definition, you want X to gain more X. By my definition, I want X to gain something but not necessarily more X.
I see "everything" as investing. If you keep your value (=money) in a bank, that's an investment. It's one investment strategy to hold everything on a bank account. One can invest in something that generates more value, but I don't see it as a requirement.

You had plenty of time to tell everyone why this opt-in feature is bad. Segwit is *not* controversial. There were tons of discussions about block size and 2-4 MB was found to be safe, so Segwit SF included a block size increase too. It's the only remotely controversial thing about it.


SF can't be done like that. You with the full node you run, choose what code you run. Miner-chosen SF's have been discussed. Miners maybe don't get that PoW can be changed, dropping them out of business. That's why miners have aligned with the *users.* Not other way around.
Segwit had 95%+ node support. The network ran the code even though blocks weren't yet built by those rules.


There's no solid arguments against Segwit which would make Segwit bad. Of course you can argue that it's a change and it means some party X needs to do Y now and it's bad. Too bad! World changes.

Also, who do you refer to when you talk about people who started working on bitcoin only when it became popular and not before that?


Sadly, this is not currently technically possible. Everyone would prefer that, obviously! Gavin too knows this and have admitted this. Gavin proposes to increase block size now to give more time for real scalability solutions.
Lots of devs have spent lots of time on the scalability issue. Gavin also has done lots of work towards making Bitcoin scalable. There are real solutions (libsecp256k1, lightning, smaller optimizations to the protocol, etc...) being made.
So you see, the devs are (or were) actually working on the long-term solutions. Possibly the whole block size limit could've been removed or whatever, so increasing the limit is (or were) actually a back-up solution. This is how I see it, currently.
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:54:44

Fact is, we can't yet get that. Hearns solutions are not scalable. Or well, they are but then we will lose trustlessness. Bitcoin is based on trustlessness.
Crypto currencies as of today just aren't scalable. Why can't Hearn &amp; co. just use their time better and work on Lightning which keeps Bitcoin trustless and leverages that trustless in decentralized centralized-hub model for everything he wants?

Also, centralized systems are most often the most efficient and powerful. As you can see, VISA can handle 10k's of tps while the decentralized Bitcoin can handle only 3 tps or so. Lightning allows us to leverage the decentralized trustless network (Bitcoin) to be used in a centralized way, getting all the power centralized ways offer.
Bitcoin would be centralized if it would be possible to make a trustless centralized system.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:58:16
... Please get your facts straight.
Lightning network is still completely trustless. Bitcoin is decentralized to be trustless. Bitcoin needs to be decentralized and trustless for Lightning and other layers to work, in trustless way.
**OF COURSE** everyone would want all the transactions to be in the blockchain but that is simply **not scalable** which is a well known fact.

There's no such thing as sides. Discussions to improve Bitcoin are just fine. To make improvements into Bitcoin, they need to go through peer review and so on. Pushing changes to consensus rules without proper analysis is just irresponsible.
Of course discussing this bitcoin scalability is just fine. Lately there's been huge amount of hate around here, though. I personally do not get why Andresen and Hearn even want to push BIP101 without consensus. Everyone knows Bitcoin needs consensus to work.

Are you sure these things are that simple? I am not that sure..
What happens to the opposing developers? Do they join or do they not? Most of Bitcoin (Core and protocol) developers are opposing. Do people think they know better than these people who have dedicated a significant chunk of their life on this project? Bitcoin is really not very simple thing.
What if only 70% of miners support it but had a lucky streak? Why did they even pick 75%? 75% is nowhere near consensus. 90% would be a lot better indicator of consensus. If we don't even care about the consensus but just want the fork to happen, then we can call it a hostile fork.
What if miners support it but community doesn't? (Say 70% of community opposes.)

I am not so sure about this.
If there were problems with Bitcoin not being trustless anymore, for some people, only the affected parties would see it. Community wouldn't do a thing for them since Bitcoin would be working well for them (the big majority.)
Keeping Bitcoin trustless (and in this case this means decentralized) is the most important thing. It's very hard to sense when it's not trustless anymore, is it?

Well, core dev Gavin didn't even sign this letter which I assume represents the view of big majority of bitcoin users. Why wouldn't he sign it? Is he against that kind of Bitcoin?
Bypassing the consensus process is by itself enough to declare XT as an altcoin (or hostile hardfork try) - and therefore offtopic &amp; deleted from Bitcoin-only boards. There are methods which must be followed when developing the Bitcoin protocol. If these weren't followed by majority and people would be running the consensus code they feel fit *to vote*, we wouldn't have consensus or Bitcoin. We could eventually reach consensus that way - just to break it again soon. Could Bitcoin work like that? Not really.

This doesn't really require very "smart contract" to do. You can e.g. use coloured coins / counterparty or similar which works on top of Bitcoin. Or bitcoins itself. E.g. send 0.01 BTC to owner. If owner sells, he sends that 0.01 BTC minus fees to new owner. CoA breaks if it stops being 1-in 1-out.

There can be standing objections as unanimity isn't required to form consensus. The objections could even be well reasoned (but, for example, trade-offs could be seen as too big by others.) The opposing sides of course aren't black and white so forming the consensus can easily allow objections.

Well, if the hub starts to behave badly, it can effectively freeze your funds. As it's still trustless, if something like this would happen constantly, there would be a market to swap frozen funds to non-frozen. The market maker wouldn't lose there since the funds are just time-locked and there's no risk (hence trustless.)

I also don't like how XT is being promoted (you know, it's not equal to other bitcoin clients and it's painted as "bitcoin core but better.") The whole "choose your wallet" thingie is quite bad. While you copypasted bitcoin.org's code why didn't you also copy the options? No, because $$$.

LN wallets are useful when private keys are on online machines (=hot wallet). This is, because LN requires active participation, which requires private keys, from both participants when a payment occurs.
Exchanges could build some layers between their exchange-faced machines and wallet machines, and they can and are doing it already with or without LN. But still they are hot wallets as private keys are not kept strictly offline.

There's no point in wasting lots and lots of time to determine the value of the block size limit - or the method of how to increase it or whether to remove it totally.
But there is point in developing actually scaling solutions. Then we could possibly completely bypass the whole issue if it became obvious what to do with block size limit.
The network can support huge blocks. It's not about that. Most Bitcoin users don't run full nodes and still use Bitcoin.
It's about what Bitcoin is. To me, Bitcoin is a trustless system. This means I need to be able to run a full Bitcoin node.
So increasing the blocks sizes is a trade-off. How about a solution where we don't need to make a trade-off?

Well, placing the "indicator" at 75%... that is nowhere near consensus. One of the key problems in XT.
What could easily happen is that miners get it through while small proportion, say 25% of the community supports it. So the miners will choose how Bitcoin works? If that's so, it's not a very good thing. And I'm pretty sure 75% of the community would do something else than honor this miners' vote.
If miners are wise, they will not mine XT blocks because that weakens the value of Bitcoin. If they are unwise and do mine XT blocks, they risk a lot (of their future profits.)
Okay, what happens if miners do SPV mine? They claim they do XT-blocks when they're actually doing whatever kind of blocks they want. This happened with BIP66. Miners voting for something they weren't doing. Huge mess would follow, not good.
Okay, so say miners did get XT through, Bitcoins' value would've already dropped hugely (due to the non- purely technical dangers of hard fork like this.) Some services using XT, some not. Doublespends everywhere, great.
If a (you could say rushed) fork like XT went through, it would tell a lot about Bitcoin. It would drop the price heavily if the (important) consensus rules can be changed this easily. Most of the devs wouldn't probably join XT side either. Who would keep XT running, then? This would probably slow down the development of crypto currencies overall.
The point is, miners doing the vote (to 75%) doesn't really tell too much about the consensus. If they set it at for example 95% it would be a totally different thing. Why put it at 75% and "force" the rest (when the 75% of miners could actually be representing minority of the community.)
At least for some time when there's no consensus and lots of uncertainty about what's going to happen, there could be two coins. Getting them to join back as one chain, after several days of building different chains, is a huge, IMO impossible task.

Who knows were this "episode" good or bad after all.
I think that XT is good to be available but it turns bad if people (&amp; services etc.) actually start using it. Now it looks like it won't gain much traction which is very good for the Bitcoin project.
Remember that block size limit isn't the key (or actually *anything*) to make Bitcoin scalable and hence available for mainstream.

Things need to be analyzed properly before pushing them to the "production." 8MB is probably just fine but we don't know it yet. Worth taking the risk? Well, probably. There are lots of consequences to Bitcoin mining which essentially secures the whole thing. We don't want to make it even more centralized.
@_date: 2015-09-02 12:37:03
Missing the big picture. Scalability has been one of the biggest problems - lots of devs time has been spent on that single problem. Increasing blocksizes is just one part of the solution (actually doesn't solve the problem at all but bigger blocks are still needed for real solutions to be great.)
It should be quite clear that there's no point in wasting too much time on near-future problems (which could be totally evaded by developing long-term solutions.)

If it's all about signalling support for something *else* than current rules, why are non-voters votes split among the options by default?
A very little portion of your miners voted. There was maybe 5% support for non-Core rules. By making this "oh you don't vote? we'll vote for you" as a default you're now able to say "XX% supports non-Core rules" because now "everyone votes" while in reality maybe 20% of miners vote. People don't really bother and you obviously know this very well too. This doesn't sound very honest way to have a "vote" or "signalling".

Then you "forced" their hashpower to represent a vote. You didn't accept those non-voting passive miners - everybody *had* to have a *political* stance if they mined in your pool.

Please do some analysis about the *content* of the blocks. I've found a *very* big portion (10-50%) of some of the blocks (when I did my analysis, it was maybe every 3rd block) are filled with big transactions which contain many very small inputs (maybe 50-100 inputs to 1 output). I call those transactions "blockchain cleaning" as they make the UTXO set smaller. Those transactions are most likely made by the pools (as they mine publicly accessible otherwise unspendably small outputs).
@_date: 2016-10-19 16:28:07
This means that while initially maybe 5% voted for XT/Classic/whatever, and a total 10% of the miners voted at all, Slush gamed the system so all the passive miners votes were cast without them acknowledging it!
Not voted means NO VOTE. It *doesn't* mean that "I vote what others vote." It's at best *very* confusing and *very* misleading. I am sure we can agree on that.
And on top of all this, we all know why this was done: to bump up the "fact" that "so many" miners want to fork to "Classic". In reality only 5% of the miners had signaled this intent. All this happened months ago, when the "Classic" boom was at the highest.

We're solely talking about the limit here because the limit doesn't need to be more than how much the network needs at time. It's there to *prevent DOS.* So let's assume that the blocks are filled enough at any limit level. If they're not, the limit is too high and allows DOS and spam to happen. And if the limit is too low, fees rise and backlog increases which is also very bad.
So let's drop that stupid thing between "actual block sizes" and "blocksize limit" while the concerns apply regardless.
Do you understand that if Bitcoin wasn't developed further from the Satoshi's original code, Bitcoin would've broken multiple times already? Setting the blocksize limit is one of these developments and without it Bitcoin would've been and can be DOS'd very heavily.
What I say about the ability to act as a fully validating node is perfectly valid.


If you ask the common man if they want cheaper transactions and more larger userbase and more transactions, they will always say yes. Everyone will say yes. What you fail to mention to them is that you are weakening the key aspect of Bitcoin: trustlessness and open innovation. How are they weakened? By the centralization which happens because people can't be part of the fully validating Bitcoin network due to increased resource costs. If you think this is a baseless argument, well, you're kind of quite lost.
And if you now tell them about this side effect, still most won't get how significant thing it really is.
If you want more TPS etc. which are gained by centralization (off-chain), please use Paypal or similar centralized service.

However it allowed Slush to claim that those 5% voting for Classic were now 30%. Proportion didn't change, but there was no more "non voted" miners. This is called gaming the results. Now you couldn't say who actually voted for Classic and who simply didn't know about the voting thing / didn't care to vote anything at all.
Remember, all these updates to Slush pool happened *out of nowhere* - very little amount of miners were aware of that they should vote something. So slush cast passive miners votes when they didn't do it themselves. About 90% of the miners were passive.

What I mean is that Lightning can scale Bitcoin without increasing blocksizes (which would weaken network security if raised too much.) 
This means we can increase blocks to the point where network security is not affected and with Lightning we can get a lot more out of that blocksize space.


Growth is obviously good but if we get growth by sacrificing network security, then it is bad. So let's get growth without sacrificing network security.


As I've explained earlier, we can say blocksizes will be at blocksize limit. If the limit is too high, there's DOS possibility. So let's just talk about the limit or actual blocksizes - we mean the same thing anyway. No point in separating these as we're talking about the same concerns.


If we set limit to like 50MB now, we would see lots of spam and lots of nodes would drop out of the network. Did you watch the video I linked?

Not yet, really. Lightning Network is in the works to leverage the already achieved confirmations instantly.
@_date: 2015-11-08 13:19:32
There are at least 3 semi-working implementations of Lightning already. There are some holes to fill but the general idea is pretty much known to be doable. You have to know about technical things and mathematics to know what is possible and what is not, even if they didn't yet exist and even if there were holes to fill.
It's also super stupid to not talk about almost-ready gamechanger technology, Lightning.


I am saying that it is important to keep things at balance. Users *will not* seek for the balance because the other end benefits them a lot more with very little *immediate* cons. And the other end is also bad but it's a lot easier to move from there towards the another end (to gain the balance between these two.)
The two ends are roughly "network security" and "TPS, UX, low fees".
Going too far into the "TPS, UX, low fees" -end will make Bitcoin Paypal 2. And it's *very* hard to fix that if it ever starts falling there. That is because for majority of users Bitcoin will work *just like before* but with lower fees and more TPS. This is called permissioned ledger.
And the other end is also very bad: Overkill technical network security. There wouldn't be that much users because fees would be a lot higher. And that would obviously be very bad for the system. 
So we need to find a good balance between these two. Funnily, current 1MB blocksize limit is pretty close to that, IMO. It could be increased quite a lot before we hit the other end badly but all the time when we weaken the network security, and make the network less decentralized, we're moving towards the other end. And as said, it's a lot harder to move back from there.
Best solution would be to keep blocksizes low enough and use Lightning. That is actually the only proper solution. We can't increase blocksizes so there'll be low fees all the time. If bitcoin userbase 100x'd now, Bitcoin couldn't handle it even if we 100x'd blocksize limit to 100MB. We would have permissioned ledger then, aka. PAYPAL 2.

BIP100 is even worse than BIP101 - so it won't be merged I think. BIP101 could possibly work with slower timespan with blocksize doubling. It's not good to give more power to the miners with BIP100.
I think doing no update is better than doing a rushed or stupid update which may not be undoable. Users will not see the change to a more centralized system. Too big blocks centralize the network. It increases UX as the transactions are much cheaper but same time we sacrifice the key aspect of Bitcoin (100% trustlessness is achieved by having up-to-date blockchain and that blockchain self-validated.) If Bitcoin gains more users, what do you think will people care about this since they may not even know about this?
Lightning is a very good solution for scalability. Increasing blocksizes is just temporary solution, for now, although needed. Blocksize limit must be in balance and it currently quite well is.

Not exactly so.
Miners, while decentralized, mine blockchain and include transactions in the blocks.
With over 50% of the hash power, miners can stop including *all* transactions in the blocks. Miners can simply mine 0-tx blocks. &gt;50% hash power can choose how the blockchain is built; but within the rules the nodes set. (Otherwise the blockchain is invalid.)
So yes they can do whatever soft fork they want. Soft fork narrows the rules, they could narrow it down to zero txes being accepted in the blockchain.
So in other words, centralized mining (&gt;50% hashrate) can stop the blockchain from growing (=stop Bitcoin).


Network doesn't care about arbitrary data in the block headers.

I don't think that is so. If you're here to improve Bitcoin and are productive, your comments won't be banned.
What do you think, is it productive to tear down or attempt it or alternation to Bitcoins consensus protocol without getting consensus among the community first? That kind of counterproductive comments are most likely deleted - because they're not productive and are just harmful.
So how do you get the consensus among the community? "OK i fork it, even while everyone among the developers seems to be against it. And I will push it to people! LET PEOPLE CHOOSE!!!" -approach is not helping while everyone else is trying to get consensus on how to proceed properly.
In the end it's Peoples choise to use whatever code they want. However, it's rational to make the changes to Bitcoin via proper channels where things are thoroughly discussed and debated among the people who know this system best.

Well, there are obviously trade-offs but it's *nothing* compared to the tradeoffs we would get by increasing blocksize too much, which would allow cheap transactions for huge userbase but simultaneously it would ruin network security.
Lightning doesn't ruin network security.
Nobody is limiting the blocksize at 1MB. It will be increased but the question is how much, where is the balance between good network security, risks, tx fees and userbase.
Increasing the blocksize stupidly now is just stupid, as that will not be the path to scale anyway. That path will lead to centralized permissioned ledger and everyone knows that - but some argue that technology will keep on pace with the blocksizes.
BIP101 may or may not be bad for network security. It's hard to say since we don't know about the future. Currently most of the developers think that it's most likely bad for the network security. It weakens it *too much.* And since it *still isn't a real scalability solution,* is it worth taking that risk?
So in the end we must find real solutions to the scalability problem. One of them is Lightning.
@_date: 2015-11-24 06:59:44
Not necessarily but those are kind of separate things. Blocksizes are best kept at a balanced value. Blocksizes could be increased now, I believe it wouldn't cause security issues, but the issue is with how to do the increase. It's not good to do manual line change everytime it's needed - or is it?
So there will be some kind of method to adjust the blocksize. It's good to think well what kind of method it should be. After all, regarding Bitcoins scalability issues, increasing blocksizes *do not* solve the problem. I very well understand that Bitcoin developers spend time on real scalability solutions (like LN) a lot more eagerly.

False. This also contributes to why people are hostile: people state "obvious" things which are false and it pisses people off.
There are people who have contributed significant amount of time on Bitcoin and understand it deeply. Then someone who barely knows what a wallet is comes and tells people what to do. OK, let's say those who know how Bitcoin works (at some level) but they don't know reasoning or importance of some aspects, come and tell people how to change those aspects to improve Bitcoin.

That is true, there needs to be a balance. 1MB is a lot closer to the balanced value than 1GB. And for the record, I think too big blocks are worse than too small blocks. 
Blocks could be unlimited if that was technically wise. Bitcoin would not be decentralized with unlimited or too big blocks. Not being decentralized means you need some sort of permission to use it, from the people in control (centralization.) At any cost that kind of scenario should be avoided. Bitcoin is using smaller blocks because of this only.


I agree. The problem here lies with the method that should be used to change the limit.

Hey, who here is talking about **keeping 1MB blocks**? Nobody. 


Wtf? Because blocks *must* be kept small enough *because of security reasons*, fees *will* get higher naturally as the space in the blockchain is scarcer.
And the last of your post, it's really nonsense. I guess you do not understand how Bitcoin works. Therefore please educate yourself before talking about Bitcoin technology. First you could start from reading what for mining is done and what is actually done when bitcoins are mined. Read about the incentive model too.
It is true that by centralization Bitcoins value would be *currently* destroyed but in the future that may not be so, if centralized version would work *just fine* for 99% of the users. But it would be permissioned ledger.
About 1MB limit: **I've been saying to YOU that it will NOT LAST, it will NOT STAY AT 1MB FOREVER and how there must be a BALANCE** and the limit set according to that. What you're doing here is **FALLING IN TO THE SAME PIT OF POLITICAL DISHONESTY LIKE MIKE HEARN.**

And next.. I guess that's bad news indeed because there are no other options, right? Increasing blocksizes to support every future user drives bitcoin into centralized permissioned network.

Anyone can run hub so how is that centralized?
You can run your hub inside TOR or whatever. If some hubs started blocking your transactions due to whatever reason, you can use another.
For increased privacy you can chain things.


You can use cheapest available hubs, and there will be competion. There may even be free hubs, and most likely will be. Doing transactions in the Lightning network isn't very resource consuming as individual hubs are centralized. That is why they can do this for like no fee at all. Lightning would also allow lots of more volume because of the *instant* confirmations (so there's no 1-conf delays, you can re-send the money instantly), individual transaction fees could be very low.
And yes it's true you could re-send 0-conf received bitcoins but that's very risky to send unconfirmed coins.

It's really after all about UX and network security. When common users are in command, majority of them obviously pick UX (lower fees, more TPS which leads to bigger blocks.) How big can they get without ruining network security and making Bitcoin permissioned ledger? There's no real visible line where it happens. Majority of Bitcoin users won't be running Core (therefore *not* helping the network) so they, who are fools which is &gt;90% of users, will not understand what size-increasing blocks *by then* will cause. Slow death.
So we must avoid that kind of situation as well as possible. It's a real threat and it's a huge one. It's a lot better to be conservative with blocksizes than rushing to too big blocks and then seeing they're bad. 


So wouldn't that give space for 4.4x more users than without Lightning? 4.4x more without making it harder for full nodes. Miners would earn their 540€ but it would come from lots more sources.

@_date: 2015-11-23 02:41:16
My new argument? It's the same as earlier, isn't it?


The censoring of one user was just an example. Maybe a better example of too much centralization would be alternation of the blockchain while including most of the original transactions. Small forks and reorgs happen all the time so that kind of thing could easily vanish and it could be called an accident or non-intentional fork.
If you don't validate everything by yourself, you're trusting others. How is Bitcoin trustless? By trusting others? Well, you can trust others if you want to but Bitcoin is what it is because you *don't need* to trust anyone in case you don't want to. Hence, it's trustless and must stay as so.
Also, you just jump to worst possible conclusions imaginable and assume you won't be treated as a troll? I think it was pretty clear what I said initially: "I think too big blocks are worse than too small blocks."

Ok, a few things.
Educate yourself about the matters you're speaking of. Don't trust random comments in the internet.


Actually most Chinese miners were already doing SPV mining. Also, it's not only about the bandwidth speed, it's also about data caps.


Sure, 8MB may works "well enough" but how about the doubling which BIP101 got? Maybe do it without the doubling? How to proceed after 8MB? That is on the table right now. Where to scale now and how to proceed.


Blocksize limit were set because of DDOS risk. Miners also get an advantage over other miners by producing big blocks. Other miners need to download and verify the huge block to continue mining. There are similar issues like this which cause more centralization. Some obvious centralizing issues are bandwidth and data cap requirements but there are many more more complicated phenomena.


This is much better than changing the system to be forced non-trustless -used aka. accidently breaking the core of Bitcoin. 8MB would probably be just fine, though. But what after that? Bitcoin doesn't scale by increasing the blocksize. If the blocksize limit is updated everytime fees get too high.. Well, Bitcoin will become cheap to use but insecure by centralization. We already have such services, why make Bitcoin like them? 
Instead, we can keep Bitcoin decentralized (trustless) and scale it with layers consisting of bleeding edge technology.


How? Are some of the developers not targetting at Bitcoin to be as good as possible?


This is exactly why you should educate yourself. Most of the people behind Blockstream did the same (cryptography, Bitcoin development) for a long time before grouped as a company called Blockstream.


Isn't that slightly contradictory.


You should know about the people behind Blockstream. And do you know how Bitcoin is being developed? Some people, like Mike Hearn, would want Bitcoin development to have *the king* or *CEO* or whatever you want to call it, a boss, who says what is done. What is more centralized than one person being in charge? Bitcoin development is also made quite decentralized, on purpose. Probably not the most efficient way though.

By just downloading the 32MB you'd be leeching the network. The point of peer-to-peer network is that you also upload it to others, preferably to more than just one peer.

Based on that article, wireless (3G/4G) providers in the UK have data caps around 2GB to 50GB per month. Only Three.co.uk offers unlimited data, others have quite low data caps.
Broadband providers in the UK seem to have generally unlimited (with Fair Use Policy) plans. Those who have data caps seem to have them at around 50GB to 100GB a month.
And UK has fairly good network.

The more *full* users, the more security and decentralization. If you trust others in the network and don't validate things yourself, you're not a full member of the network. This is obvious so why do you try to stir up drama.


How come BIP101 got hardly any support from Bitcoin developers and there are lots of other BIPs around or being worked on?
And now the most vocal BIP101-supporter Mike Hearn has stopped to work on this issue. Not interested in collaborative work to find a proper solution to adjust blocksize limit. Meanwhile lots of people are working on the solution.
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:37:15
Well, you apparently fail to understand what I mean or you do it intentionally. Anyway, let me clarify.
What I mean by "too small is better than too big" is that it's a lot easier to increase the blocksize limit than decrease it. Too small blocks only cause inconvenience and high fees (and yes, less decentralization in the form of decreasing userbase) but too big blocks could cause invisible centralization, or walking towards that inevitable centralization. One day you'd notice you've been censored out of the bitcoin network. Others wouldn't complain since for majority, say for 98% of users Bitcoin would work perfectly. But it would be permissioned ledger then, even if users didn't even see that. It's that decentralization and trustlessness are very hard to measure - and even harder is to know how much is enough.
So then go tell to the userbase "oops we actually should have smaller blocks since now I were censored out of the network because of those big blocks! How about we switch back to smaller blocks and pay more fees and have less TPS &amp; userbase?" and people will laugh at you.
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:02:04


**It is not a minor change.** It's a hard fork which carries huge risks on several levels. For example, nodes need more resources to be able to be part of the network, miners need to figure out how to mine most efficiently (block propagation speeds &amp; orphaned blocks vs gained bitcoins from fees etc.) and current *incentive model* of Bitcoin is being altered significantly. And so on. There are reasons why these things are being discussed and debated constantly, for the last 3 years or so on. Solutions which have been proposed need to be carefully examined by the community (developers, peer review) and well analyzed. Making rushed "I think it'll work" -solutions and pushing them to the people, bypassing the majority of peers opinion, is irresponsible and very stupid. 


It very much does affect bitcoin owners and users, technically too. For example if you became unable to use Bitcoin 100% trustless because you couldn't validate the blockchain anymore due to data caps or bandwidth. In the worst case Bitcoin's security would be effectively traded for better UX like transaction capacity and low fees. Guess which most people prefer?


Allows more people to use Bitcoin but it still isn't a real scalability problem *solution* and everyone agrees on this. If Bitcoin really wants to scale and be able to support lots of more users, real scalability solutions like Lightning Network are needed. So why not just keep Bitcoin blocksizes reasonably low so as many as possible can run fully validating Bitcoin node? Blocksizes must be kept at balance between UX and network security. Current 1MB limit is IMO lower than what the Bitcoin network could handle securely currently but we still need a proper way to increase the limit. Work is being done all the time. And I very well understand why those who know Bitcoin the best have focused on Lightning-style solutions instead of what kind of model should be used to change the blocksize limit.


Lots of bitcoin users aren't doing on-chain transactions at all. While Bitcoin network can't carry all the transactions, off-chain (centralized) solutions are currently supporting more than just two million active users.
But I see what you mean, it's the scalability problem of Bitcoin. It's a very tough one and has been worked on for years and it is *not solved by simply increasing blocksizes*.

The masses can't ever understand all the things the software they run is doing. They will just use what works the best. And guess what kind of Bitcoin would work the best? The one where 99% of people can transact for low fees and TPS would be huge. And then the last 1% would be denied the usage. The 99% of users wouldn't even know about the unjust treatment against the 1% of users. Just google up "Paypal sucks" and I'm sure you'll be amazed how much content you find where people have been unjustly treated by Paypal. I know people whose accounts have been frozen without justified reason.
So which one would you choose? Bitcoin where 99% of users can transact lots for cheap or Bitcoin where 100% of users can transact less and fees would be higher? 
(PS. Don't remember Lightning which solves lots of the scalability problem! - so maybe we could keep it at 100%?)

Well, there can be only one consensus. Why would you want to break the consensus?
You can preach to get people to separate from the consensus. But you must see that is hurting the consensus, so it's obvious it'll be defended. This has nothing to do with decentralization or how trustless Bitcoin is. What if people started forking consensus rules how they wanted. That is OK, right? But what if some crappy consensus rule fork were advertised to the masses heavily and people actually started using it (because they trust the maintainer,) without knowing about the consequences? It is made hard to get that kind of changes through. Consensus must be formed among community before making code changes &amp; pushing them to people (who rely on persons opinions only and don't know about the tech.) If you don't do that, well, you're working against the consensus (and Bitcoin *needs* consensus!)

Bandwidth, history validation (validating the entire blockchain from 0), latencies, etc. Why increase? To what? 10MB would be way too much and would only allow 10x the current possible. Also, blocks are not full. Bitcoin is still "too cheap" to use. Miners get the fees anyway while nodes carry *all* the weight. Ability to run a node must be preserved as Bitcoin is for people - validation should be possible by reasonably everyone.
Anyway, search for reasons why the blocksize is good to be kept low enough. Gavin doing this "hey emails don't have restrictions!!!" -thing is not helpful, so avoid such nonsense. There are valid reasons to keep the blocksize low. Ability to run a node on a RPi is not one of them.

Even if some individual LN hub operators denied your LN usage, you could use some other hub or make one yourself. There will always be regulation-free hubs. And if you're using the hub and then they deny your transactions, well, your money will be time-locked for a while in the worst case. And you could use these hubs via TOR etc.
About privacy... 
You can chain LN transactions, you can use CoinJoin to increase your privacy before using Lightning etc.
About the sustainability of the fees: Bitcoin base network will have its uses (like colored coins, settelements etc.) and there will be lots of volume (with increased blocksizes, too, to keep the individidual fees low enough but still not too low.) Lightning can be used as "cache" for the simple transactions.

You're right, there needs to be good balance where the blocksize limit is set.
Lightning is *real* scalability solution because with it not everyone needs to know about everyones transactions. And blocksizes obviously must increase too but it's really not that important matter, seriously. Bitcoin can't work if everyone needs to have Paypal-level server equipment with huge internet connection costs, this will always (or if not always, this is currently the most obvious path) be the case as transaction amounts will increase too.
So the solution *must* be that not everyone needs to validate and/or download every single transaction happening in the trustless Bitcoin network.

It's their best interest to get more users. Security of the network is secondary. Users get them their money.
They can keep on running the node (being full member of the network) long after common people have dropped off the network of full nodes. So it doesn't weaken network security from their point of view.
BIP101 probably isn't the worst possible option but advocating it while nearly all of the people who develop Bitcoin are against it, is quite irresponsible.

Thanks. I guess something around 10MB blocksize aka. 7M active users should be doable at least, without sacrificing or risking network safety. I'm not sure would Bitcoin allow that *right now* - possibly.

Of course you can have as many implementations as possible - and those are not censored. But if you have different consensus rules in your code, that is actually not Bitcoin then anymore.

Apparently miners extend the chain with near to 0-value transactions (as the fees are near 0!) All the nodes need to carry this added weight.
Maybe the 1MB limit will make miners include higher fee transactions only? They get the compensation anyway. Increasing blocksizes lets them add more and more meaningless transactions in to the chain - and nodes carry the weight. They're meaningless because they pay no fee. If they paid a proper fee (like $0.20) they wouldn't be that meaningless. In that sense.

He's not really honest. To spot the dishonesty you must know Bitcoin quite well. The dishonesty lies in small details (which may be actually quite important after all!), weighting things in a non-fair way and such. It's basically what politicians do.
Take a look at, for example: 
Would you consider that as honest? Strictly he's correct (XT *currently* uses bandwidth like Core) but that is not how his reply is understood. His reply is understood as "XT is and will use same amount of bandwidth as Core" - and XT is *known* (among the people who know) because of the increased bandwidth costs. For common bitcoiner they may not know what XT really is set to do. Some even think that it's just alternative implementation which it is not (because it also alters the protocol rules by setting some rule about if blocks announce something the rules change.)
And btw, follow developers channels and such. You'll see where and by whom the real work is done. Not that Mike wouldn't also contribute - but it's not really that much.
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:22:38


Not an issue *I guess* because only thing you can lose is money-time (money frozen for short period of time) and information about your payments (&amp; you). There will be services which will take care of money-time issues (if those happen) and you can probably use Tor or some other network with the Lightning. Also, I've heard that Joinmarket-style (Coinjoin) gets a significant boost from Lightning.


Well.. This time you'll be able to choose who's your middlemen if any.


The limitation really comes from opening and closing channels. I'd see that even current 1MB limit can do quite a lot of these *and* all the non-Lightning transactions. Currently there are lots of very low fee transactions and big amount of 50kB+ low-fee "many inputs to one output" -sweeping transactions (by pools.) This means there's space in the blocks, just that currently pools are doing some UTXO cleaning meanwhile people are not doing transactions.

@_date: 2016-05-07 23:29:36


Do you know why Core never had any "operative leader" after Gavin?
Basic misinformation spread especially in other subreddits. Corrections: Core has been developing scalability solutions for years (since 2011 something?). They did not start developing them when Gavin or whoever made it a hot topic. Core has been very carefully working towards more decentralization and leadership-less development. This is what I've seen. Also, I'm not a Core developer and they obviously know this better.


Bitcoin after all works because the community wants it to work. If miners at large start doing stupid things, the community can choose to change rules so shut down those stupid miners. All this means that it's the community who dictates what is Bitcoin. Changing Bitcoin requires consensus among the community. Spreading binaries/links to software which uses different rules than what the community is using, can be seen as an attack. Bitcoin will not be improved by competition between system rules. This is what altcoins are for. Want some other rules than what Bitcoin uses today? Make an altcoin. Want those rules in Bitcoin system? Follow the procedure. Procedure is shit? Improve it. Or don't. And don't follow the procedure if you don't want to. Makes it harder to get consensus behind the improvement proposal. Consensus behind the proposal is something that is hard to measure which is also why defining some improvement idea as an attack is highly subjective. In these cases high majority of the top experts of Bitcoin (not just devs but other smart people too) have been against those improvement ideas, which would make the more an attack than not an attack. If there was some reasonable amount of people supporting those ideas they wouldn't be seen as an attack by so big portion of the community.
Also, XT/Classic are not traditional forks. They use different rules than which Bitcoin system uses today. They're simply not compatible, even though they *currently* kind of are. But in right conditions they will operate in a non-compatible way, making them something else than Bitcoin we use today. Those clients do not have any sign of consensus support. The consensus should be gained before pushing the implementation, IMO. Otherwise it really does look like an attack. 


I can only see work by Core devs being used in the network (viewed from my nodes.) Whose work do you see?


In real world I barely see any opposition to what Core devs do. I really can't see this "substantial segment of Bitcoin user base." If this is true, it doesn't seem to count.


No, actually. Think about this. People want efficiency. Everybody wants efficiency. Efficiency goes straight against decentralization (currently, maybe improved in the future.) People at large don't understand or care about decentralization, this is obvious and nobody can deny this, right? People think it's cool and stuff but the real benefits are rarely visible. People who have had problems with centralized systems usually value decentralization and monetary sovereignity - which is what Bitcoin offers. What I mean by all this is that efficiency is a lot more important to people than decentralization. And the current situation is that you can't improve one without sacrificing another. It's obvious what majority of people would "vote" here. Actually, majority of people are already voting for the efficiency; they use centralized and therefore very efficient systems. After all majority of people don't have any problems with those centralized systems.
Bitcoin developers are those people who don't vote efficiency here. There are lots and lots of various systems which offer better efficiency than Bitcoin ever (possibly) can. But none of the other systems can offer the same level of security, monetary sovereignity etc. that Bitcoin offers.

No. Think about this for a while. They are individual developers who produce open source code for you to use or not to use. You decide. Apparently Core has listened to the community because the community seems to be using Core pretty much solely? 
Also, community are mostly not experts. There are some and some of them are already doing the work - they don't need some "community" to tell them what to do.

Windows is closed platform. How can you code anything secure on that?
Of course majority of people don't care.
@_date: 2015-10-16 09:05:20
Well, there's a reason why Bitcoin wouldn't work as closed source. With closed platforms and software you can't know what it's actually doing. You don't even have the possibility to verify the code.
So running Bitcoin on Windows.. Well, not a problem currently. You know these days Windowses call home all the time. Though you can hack it to not do that. But you can't really opt out, Windows doesn't let you choose. So majority of Windows users are sharing lots of personal data with people around the world. It could easily report your bitcoin transactions and so on. I wouldn't call that secure. With Linux you can get peer reviewed, signed code all the way from the kernel to the Bitcoin client.

$300k in 2020 is highly conservative. A bit less than 5 years and bitcoin value would rise only 115300%?
So roughly 1150x the current value. That would be only 270x *in 5 years*.
Market cap is currently about 3640 MUSD (about 14M coins and $260 per coin.) 2020 we would have like 18M coins? Market cap would be 5400 billion if 1 coin was $300k. Let's look at *one* company, for example Microsoft which market cap is 400 billion. If we take about 20 of these kind of companies we would have more than the entire market cap of Bitcoin (in 2020.)
I think it's very doable to at least spike the value of Bitcoin market cap to 5 Microsofts'.

You can't be serious.
Toxicity is that you don't want to collaborate and you just want to see the world burn.
Blockstream is working on code that is published for everyone to use or not to use. They use lots of their own resources to build Bitcoin further. They don't need you to tell them what to do, especially when you are not willing to collaborate but just steer the wheel.
All Bitcoin developers are like this. There's this thing called technical community. Things like human respect can be seen in there. Hardly any toxicity there.
What is Roger doing? Currently running the most toxic discussion forum in the Bitcoin scene. He's also helping it to be even more toxic, as has been demonstrated *several* times. He trolls the forum even himself. Trolling is maybe a bit mild word. It's pure shit. He may mean good but he's blinded by the anger.

I can't deny miners from accepting these 0-fee transactions in the blocks.


People who run nodes do have the need to limit the growing speed of blockchain. People who connect to other peoples nodes? They just shout they want everything.

Discussions here don't really form consensuses. You can discuss these things here but if you want to find out whether you can get consensus amongst the people who know Bitcoin best, push your ideas to the dev mailing list or IRC or Github, to other developers. Maybe even make a BIP of it.
If developers have a consensus it's worth doing it, it most likely has consensus among the community too. After all, devs are the people who know Bitcoin best.
If Reddit Community thinks that doing X is a good way forward with Bitcoin - but developers disagree, consensus is not formed. And vice versa but not as strongly.

It is of course read by lots of people. Probably less than 1% of the users, though. But if the code were found bad by someone who actually read it, people would hear about it very fast and the bad guy would be also known because code changes are tracked.

Good text.
There still are some problematic things..., like humans. We all could have our own specific crypto currencies - but is that a good goal? If we want one global "base" crypto currency, like what Bitcoin is today, what is needed? Who controls the main sources for source code?
Some claim that it's not good that some group of people controls the main source of source code. They say those people are in control of what people actually run. They're wrong. Why? Because those who don't know what they run choose to do that. They choose to rely on the source they found the link/code from. They choose to rely on the majority. Those individuals use their "vote" like that, and they're free to use it like that. And people who know what they're doing can modify the code or look for alternative sources or whatever - write the whole protocol from scratch!

We're far from high fees. How big portion of blocks are transactions with $0.05 fee or more? Indeed; we're not even close to full blocks at minimum fee level of $0.05.

The worse thing is that Mike Hearn doesn't want to contribute his time anymore to find a solution to the blocksize limit problem. Devs are collaboratively working on solutions. BIP101 is just one of the candidates and apparently Hearn wants to push it through or nothing. Certainly looks like collaborative work and better solutions are secondary for him.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:30:35


It really depends on how much it's increased. If it's too much, it will - heavily. Do you know what happens when blocksizes are increased? Increasing blocksize limit will result in bigger blocks as I explained earlier.


Requiring shitton of bandwidth and data transfer from all peers around the network.. Well, those are not cheap either! And if we can keep the stress out of the base network, isn't that good for all as in less fees for everyone as it's overall cheaper to transact in the network? More for less.


It will be a lot easier to do all kinds of attacks, even the 51% attack, when you can make huge blocks. You can punish smaller miners by making huge blocks so they can start mining the next block only after they've received the last one. This kind of amplifies the difference between miners hashrates. They could do SPV mining - which they're doing at least in China - but we've seen the consequences of that. (SPV mining is kind of headless mining power, it can be tricked to mine bad stuff.) SPV mining may also become impossible in the future.


There were soft limits (at least at 500kB and 750kB) for years. Soft limits kept the balance I've been talking to you about. Experts have also said that Bitcoin wouldn't have worked years ago with even 1MB blocks.


There are all kinds of DOS attacks. For example if we set the limit to 100 MB a miner could produce 100MB block full of hard-to-validate transactions. It would take a lot time to first download the block, validate it and think about the propagation time with that! And that miner would've already started mining the next block when others are still validating it. This is especially dangerous if one of the biggest miners would start doing this.


Is it for the miners? They could gain an advance against other miners by doing it.
We can talk about the limit or actual blocksizes, same concerns would apply anyway... So let's just keep on talking about the actual blocksizes then.

Theymos is anti-censorship. Do some research for example about why scammers are not banned from bitcointalk.org.
The *debate* were ongoing all the time until one side said "fuck it! We don't listen to you anymore, we'll do the patch NOW!"
Hearn fucked up the sane debate and now the outcome is that Hearn lost lots of his credibility. What is so damn hard to understand in that big majority of Bitcoin devs and community are against such patch. So why do the patch and push it to people? Because that's "decentralization" or "voting mechanism"? Please.
Let's make it clear here: **Debating is perfectly fine. Making fork and pushing it to people is another thing.**
Only one of these were censored. All updates to bitcoin and debate about them is perfectly fine. Yes, it was censored briefly here when it was too noisy and didn't bring any sane outcome at the time, that is called moderation. Currently debating about BIP101 etc. is perfectly fine, just like it were before, too.
While I say some refused to participate in the IRL scaling workshop, I mean the people (namely Hearn) who could've participated but instead refused to do so. That is "I wanna do stuff but not with you" -behaviour. Not cool. Not only that conference non-attending tells about that kind of behaviour. If you read the mailing lists and so on, there have been cases where some developers have been stubborn and even stupid. But they've learned. Now it's time to see Hearn learn how to work colloboratively and without doing stupid things. Currently he's not showing signs of change, though. How come other Bitcoin devs get along quite well?

Some would say that is natural development of crypto currencies. Possibly, but could we please do that kind of expirementing with other crypto currencies first? It may slow down the evolution of crypto currencies significantly if we *fuck up* things now by ignoring opinions of the people who *know* and *understand* these systems very deeply and who made all this possible.

You're missing my point. The point is that there are lots of low value transactions, which transfer like $0.50 of value. Permanently. Globally. Nodes who process that transaction get no compensation.
A big portion of the full blocks transactions is these low value transactions which pay very small fee. When a fee of $0.20 is something that gets your transaction to be part of the blockchain, there won't be many $.50 value transactions.
$0.20 is still very small but I'll tell you there's *lots* of space in the blocks for a fee of $0.20.

The fee is to pay the miners and also to prevent spam.


Blocks are full of near to zero fee transactions. It's super cheap to "spam" the network when fees are like 0.0002 BTC / kB. Only $500 to keep all the blocks (6 blocks) full for an hour. Start paying a proper fee when you're doing a meaningful transaction. Although you don't need to pay a proper fee yet as the fee levels are very low still. Paying $0.10/250bytes tx will get you almost always to the first block.

Unconfirmed is very far from 1-block confirmed. I'd say it's fair to call it binary-enough as the difference between "part of the chain" and "not part of the chain" is huge.


Yes, I know this. Why are you teaching me?


No. Let me teach you. :)
This has been demonstrated several times. Even the most high quality "confidence analyzers" can be fooled. The difference between 1-conf and 0-conf is still huge.
We have *the blockchain* for transactions. Anything not in the blockchain is simply not in the blockchain and is *never* guaranteed to ever be part of it. 
Unconfirmed transactions are simply candidates to possibly be included into a block which builds the chain. Work has been done to seal *your transaction* when it's in a block. It may be reasonably reversable for some time, yes, but still much harder to reverse than simply doing *no work at all* and replacing the transaction while they're on the same *replaceable* level. Your node doesn't know what my node knows.
RBF has nothing to do with the "double spendability" at level 0 (the unconfirmed level). It's very easy and this RBF (opt-IN or full or whatever RBF) doesn't have anything to do with that.

Well, you're obviously lying here.
Discussions about the block size are not removed.
Bitcoin XT is made to work with different consensus rules than other Bitcoin clients, hence one could say that it is not Bitcoin client. It is functioning alike *currently* but possibly not in the future - there's rules which are not part of consensus-approved protocol rules. If you want to patch Bitcoin consensus ruleset, do it via the correct channels and get the *consensus* behind it before trying to push it to people. If Bitcoin loses the consensus about its rules.. - well, we don't have to see that happening. Now do you see why links to Bitcoin XT binary are removed?
So... Posts which are trying to break Bitcoin (yes, they may say they're patching it but in the real world it's actually breaking it) versus posts about a common Bitcoin client.
About XT: It would only be a patch if people actually started using it and XT became to what we known as Bitcoin. That would of course come with very serious side effects like losing lots of the credibility (of crypto currencies), losing lots of developers and many other things.

People don't understand how Bitcoin works. They and everyone wants everything, sure.
IF you want these updates apply to Bitcoin Core (and to the protocol,) make a BIP, get the green light from community (mailing list, irc dev community, github, fix the issues if there are some in your BIP and so on.) SKIP this process, you'll fail horribly at pushing your fork. And if you get the damn bright red light, don't try pushing it since it's apparently hugely bad update to Bitcoin.

Benovelent dictator of XT, Mike Hearn. How about him? And here we're talking about improvements to the protocol, not about who makes decisions about the protocol.


Isn't it quite the opposite? Isn't Blockstreams business model to make money by holding Bitcoin &amp; making Bitcoin succeed?


To be a stable platform, rushing with changes to the protocol shouldn't be done. Bitcoin can be the backbone, expansions can be done to it but shouldn't be required by everyone. That is how solid systems work.


How can someone claim that is simple, obvious upgrade? If it were so, why isn't it so? How come there are various kinds of angles that need to be carefully examined?

One of the major problems for Bitcoin is that people actually do choose centralized unfair service over decentralized fair service. This can be seen in the world. People know the unfairness and other bad things (rich get richer, poor get poorer) and are still actively participating in the system. It's simply much more easier, cheaper, faster, "secure" etc. for most people to use centralized services. E.g. it may be that centralized system shows *only the good stuff* for 90% of its users. These 90% of people are genuinely very happy with it. The rest, 10%, are forced in the unfairness (if they want to use that centralized system.) These 90% of people might see centralization as the solution (they have never had problems with centralization) to fight the trade-offs caused by decentralization.
That's a rough example, but maybe someone can get ideas about it and think further.
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:35:10


That really means that you obviously do not know about theymos at all. Please do some research and don't trust others, do the work yourself.
Could you please separate *debate about ideas* and *debate about whether implementation &amp; download links should be allowed*?


What I saw is that XT-hype were pumped. For a while, the subreddit frontpage was *all about XT*. That is community censoring everything else. Really good discussion were negrated (so effectively "community censored") because pro-XT people didn't like the technical or otherwise wise answers (by, for example, bitcoin devs who were arguing against the XT, questioning it's sanity.) I am very sure that people do not understand the incentive -or any other- models of Bitcoin and why Bitcoin absolutely **needs** them or it's gone. Don't trust me? Do your research. Of course crypto currencies won't go away but we can definitely fuck up things so it'll slow down heavily. Ignoring the people who understand what they're doing, that's very bad. After all people rely on other people when they're deciding what to do, unless they know what they're doing and those people are very very small minority.
About "waiting indefinitely", well there were development going on. BIP101 *still needs* analyzing and testing, those were not done by the authors of the BIP. So it stalled. Other devs said it's bad because of the doubling mechanism. But this all needs lots of thinking - there's no point in rushing with these things because that will hurt credibility etc. Better do things cleverly but still without being too conservative. I don't think Bitcoin is being developed too conservatively. **Huge amounts of work** have been done during these years. It seriously tells a lot when these devs say it's a bad thing and one guys still goes and ignores others opinions and implements it and pushes it to the community as a "solution" to the problems.
All the ideas and debating re: Bitcoin development, scalability etc. are totally permitted. That is **not** censored, alright?

Anyone can fake nodes. You can't prove a unique node exists. You can channel 1 real node to 1000000 interfaces of their own IPs etc. It's still just one node, ran by one person. There is no way to detect spoofed node.
Also, is the network really decentralized if you have one guy running 1000 nodes? Node counters are bad source for information.


Maybe. Only thing what matters is that you can run a node if you want. That is decentralization.

Discussions about how to make Bitcoin better and so on are open and free for all. What is the problem with this? Have you seen this *not* being allowed?
Now, you're obviously mixing my sentences poorly. I'll try to clear it, though I think you're just trolling now.
**Pumping and hyping Bitcoin-XT is very different than discussions about how to improve Bitcoin. XT threads were to discuss the implementation where these ideas were implemented. That is not discussion about how Bitcoin should be developed. That is discussion about a fork which changes Bitcoin rulesets without community consensus. I wouldn't have removed these threads, mainly because that way XT wouldn't have gained (possibly) any traction at all. I still perfectly understand why those threads were deleted. They crossed the line - they were not about patching Bitcoin, they were about attacking the current consensus rules &amp; Bitcoin. They were to push people to use Bitcoin-XT (which uses different rules than other Bitcoin implementations, hence one could say it's not Bitcoin anymore.) Bitcoin-XT could change to be what people consider Bitcoin, but doing that in a "fuck the discussion, let's make code and pump it to people" -way is just hostile and bad for everyone.**
Let me be very damn clear here: Everyone has the same goal. If you think Bitcoin rules could be updated by doing change X, then discuss the change X with the community. If you just make code where you implement this rule update and start pushing it to people, you'll face pretty pissed people and you'll lose your credibility instantly. This has happened here.

The most wrong thing here is human thinking. People think everything "just works". People don't get *why* Bitcoin exists and works. And many seem to think that developers are slaves which can be switched at will.
So, people (I'd say majority) don't even want decentralization. They can't see why they would need it. Why would they? It's a fact that centralized systems can be more effective which means cheaper,faster,easier access to people to the system. Sure, some 1% may be denied to access the system. But why would the 99% who can access, care? They don't even *see* that there are people who are denied, for one reason or another.
Why would bitcoiners be any different? Well, luckily *a big portion* of bitcoiners understand that *ultimate decentralization* is the base of Bitcoin. Weakening it risks the whole system to threats that can't even possibly be seen by the majority (99% vs 1%). So this is why blocksizes (and therefore minimum requirements to be part of the system) are restricted, by the community. Even today there are people in the community who *simply cannot* use Bitcoin in a trust-less, decentralized way.
Blocksizes should increase, because the tech gets better globally, but how much is too much? We need more information and need to do analysis and we get this by rising blocksizes in small steps. There are some tough problems in Bitcoin system still, for example that nodes need to process, store and share all the information and they get no compensation to do this. Miners fees do not go to them. Increasing blocksizes increases the costs to run nodes. After all the possibility to run a node must be preserved, because running a node is the only way the system stays decentralized - when everyone can verify everything if they want to.
But, again, the only big problem here is human thinking. People don't care about the future. It doesn't help that Bitcoin is extremely complex system. Bitcoin system needs work (and be developed) so human factor isn't relevant, while understanding that human factor builds the whole system and keeps it running.

@_date: 2016-07-24 11:03:07
"Node counter sites" are not accurate because counting nodes is near to impossible. You can make estimates, but *anyone* can game the count. Just like how they did with XT/Classic. They popped up 100's or 1000's of nodes on some cheap VPSes, or even same VPS with 10's or 100's of different IP's.
@_date: 2016-07-24 12:12:17

Well, CB changing (increasing) fees, CEOs journey in the Ethland which e.g. caused poor internal wallet management, controversial support service answers (like when they said that ETH-F contract to address payments are not processed, but then another one said exact opposite), etc. There are certainly CB *and* Bitcoin related topics to discuss.

You would want a totally separate program to generate single keypairs. You don't want software that has a wallet to generate outside-the-wallet keys. There are many programs around to generate single keypairs, e.g. 'ku' by richardkiss.

It is trivially easy to create a very long chain. And you can make it so it's still accepted at 1/1/2016. The point is, it won't be accepted because the total sum of difficulty of the blocks will still be lower than current Bitcoin blockchain. It is the difficulty which consumes a lot of power.

Yeah, well.. It's quite hard to do automatic estimation with this history:

Just suddenly I received my ban after talking with him! LOL. I don't want to be rude, but that is just retarded! He always says how he's open etc. but then when you engage in a discussion with him, he stays silent when answers should be given.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:46:02
would have 20% complaining about the censorship of r/btc but they censor it.
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:23:44
I don't know if ToS has been violated. Is trading subreddits permitted?
My point anyway is that r/btc is "also censored".
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:53:18
You misunderstood what Luke said.
You use full node to validate that you have received real bitcoins. You can broadcast your own transactions however you want, as it's not security-critical stuff. E.g. broadcast via Tor.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:48:35
Consider the rest as "no comment". You can join Core too.

How big portion of your friends is using Bitcoin without permission from anyone?
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:31:04
Miners only do the ordering of the transactions. They build the blockchain. *Nobody needs to trust them about the transactions.* Your node verifies that transactions put in the blocks are valid.

Ok. Well, it may be that in the future someone comes up with a hack for the current trezor version you have, so do NOT do anything that causes the device to lose those keys..

@_date: 2018-12-20 22:00:32
Yeah well I wouldn't be against such merge, although I think that it should be on a separate program. (I think Core has been trying to separate wallet and node functionalities, anyway.) Do you have a PR link?

OP has value. Puts peoples minds back to the ground (instead of the moon.)

@_date: 2015-02-09 17:05:45
The system can be gamed so you could mine a longer chain than the chain we have today. But the total sum of the difficulty of the blocks would be far away from the real Bitcoin blockchain.
For example, you could keep the difficulty low by gaming timestamps.

These altcoins do not have future planning at all. Any kind of system could work in the current state where nobody is really attacking the systems. When you count in what e.g. countries can in theory do, most of the altcoins sink deep.

They were pushing for a controversial hardfork. The chain splits when there's significant controversy, and it was obvious with XT from the beginning that there is such.

But in addition to that, you can run one single node behind several interfaces. Say IP X and Y both connect to the same node. This method can be used to spoof the node counters, by for example making the node available to public at 1000 different IPs.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:21:02


Bitcoin Core will never make a decision about consensus rules. It's not that they're incapable, it's that they actively choose to represent consensus, not "make" one.
Project can't push any change, but individual developers of course can and should.
@_date: 2016-07-27 14:47:59
Not so ridiculous after all. Analysis was made a year later which shows that 4MB is the safe limit (XT would've bumped it to 8MB.)
I don't know if there's more analysis done after that, or if situation has changed since the analysis. The analysis, AFAIK, is considered to be valid.
@_date: 2016-07-24 12:15:59
Also, check my reply to you about the node counts.
Using "X has Y nodes" as an argument.. Weak!

I see that people are against exposing this functionality in the QT client. (Not cli.) Only Luke seems to be properly against it. I only glazed through the messages, so might be that I missed something.
Also, it seems to be off-topic for that mailing list, as J. Schnelli notes in there... Did you post it to github or bitcoin-core-dev ML?
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:37:25


This is not really like this. When the Ledger web wallet learns about your xpubkey, it will know all your history, current and future transactions of that wallet.
You would need to generate a whole new wallet and then never use that wallet on that web wallet thingie, so xpubkey doesn't get leaked to them. Using Electrum your Electrum client only requests Electrum servers info about specific addresses, i.e. info requesting (=privacy leaking) is based on single addresses, not the whole wallet.
Also, as a curiosity, Ledger wallet plugin had a bug which allowed any web page to learn the xpubkey of your Ledger while plugged in. These kind of risks are always around...
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:30:44


Analysis about this shows the contrary. Google it up.


Bitcoin is mostly about financial sovereignty.  Other systems may be faster, simpler and cheaper but they offer no financial sovereignty -- for instance.

There was this one story where the seed phrase was stored on paper and that paper had been trashed (by someone else). The guy couldn't remember his pin code to the device, so he wanted to restore from seed -- but that seed phrase paper was already gone.

You can count node interfaces but not actual nodes. You simply cannot verify a node behind the interface is unique, therefore nodes are uncountable.

Wonder why R. Ver paid $100k to "own" r/btc... Which is currently being censored way much more than r/bitcoin. LOL. Though their way to censorship is not yet clear to everyone - because well, nobody here cares about r/btc and r/btc silences those who bring this up!

Untrue. It may seem like that when misinformation, wild price predicting (up or down) happens or so? There's some thread manipulation around here, it's sometimes hard to detected legit users in the masses. 
I am sure that mods are not intentionally modding like how you describe it, e.g. modding using bearishness/bullishness as any factor in decisions.

Yeah, this is insane. Frustrating. Just leave them and be productive where people actually respect you &amp; your work.
Maybe believe that majority of people aren't bamboozled so Bitcoin can succeed.
It's probably one of the hardest issues in Bitcoin; stupid people want to change it in a stupid way. Rough but true. People want efficiency. People also want to change systems they don't know about. Efficiency sadly goes pretty much straight against decentralization (currently). This is why "XT" got some popularity; luckily Bitcoin community is still small enough that big enough portion of it can understand why Bitcoin exists and how it really works.
I'm sure Gavin &amp; others understand these things well. The only good way out of this problem is to develop a well-working real scalability solution. But why are they wasting time with these stupid non-solutions......

Learn about Ethereum and especially about how fragile it is, and why being fragile is very bad.
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:35:55
wtf? What exactly is the problem here?
The point of mine is: One can mine a very long blockchain easily but it won't be accepted by bitcoin because the total sum of difficulty of the blocks will be smaller than current bitcoin blockchains. So the _length_ doesn't matter itself.
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:17:23
Yes, it is significantly cheaper.
And yes, indeed, we could have 10 real nodes behind the 5.5k interfaces. But, I think it's safe to assume we have a bit more than 10 real nodes. I know more than 10 people who run their own full nodes.

This, the barrier of entry, would need some proper research. I think there are major factors making that barrier that are not related to the block sizes. Some of the possible factors: One needs to keep it updated. One doesn't use computer where he wants to use Bitcoin (e.g. he uses mobile phone). It takes a while before it boots up (e.g. keep your computer off for a week and it'll need to sync that week of blocks -- it'll need to do it regardless of how much needs to be synced, and it'll always be "too much" even if blocks were 100kB. a 2 minute start-up time is as bad as 20 minutes, for many.) These are just some not-resource-related factors, but there are a lot more. Also maybe these factors should be divided into "factors that make real barrier of entry" and the rest, inconvenience etc. increasing factors.
So even if resource-related barriers were "fixed", how would it affect the barrier of entry that still has those other factors?
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:22:39
Splitting a coin in two chains decreases utility, to name one of the downsides. Decreased utility means decreased valuation, and obviously no sane Bitcoin investor wants to see that happen.
