I can appreciate where you are coming from but I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve. Not everyone shares your values

I just joined reddit purely to reply to this. I think the way some exchanges handle forks is damaging to investor's wealth. It particularly hits hard newbies. Let me explain
When a coin forks, one might think that one becomes two. This is not the case. One becomes THREE. When Ethereum forked, we had original ETH (rebranded Classic), hard-fork ETH which resisted the DAO attacked, and we had yet another THIRD coin appear purely as a result of this situation. That coin was anything on PRE-FORK blocks, which had replay rights to BOTH ETC and ETH. So you have post-fork ETH, post-fork ETC and pre-fork ETH&amp;ETC combined. THREE coins, the latter being the most valuable.
What some exchanges are doing is giving investors a major haircut when these forks happen. Exchanges are consciously converting investors from the last listed coin above (the most valuable one) into one of the other two (less valuable ones). The difference in value doesn't just disappear. Someone steals it.

No - quite a few exchanges are going to convert Bitcoin that exists on both chains to lesser value BTC or BTU that exists on only one chain, and give plenty of naive investors a haircut while stealing the difference, just like happened with the ETH fiasco. These forks are turning out to be lucrative for exchanges. There will likely be plenty more of them in coming years. And don't even get me started on the "loaned bitcoin" issue, what does the loaner get back - pre fork (combined) or post fork (single chain) value? Conflation of pre-fork and post-fork coins is ripe for abuse, and is being abused in the industry.

Sit tight through the fork while there is confusion, and when you later transfer your coins to anyone (like an exchange) make sure it's clear they will credit you with BOTH BTC and BTU. It is likely that at least some exchanges will.

Yes, you lost (some) of your bet, because if you tried to lay it off with a bookie, you'd get a worse price. Same thing

I used to play poker - a lot - when I was in my 20's. I would lose thousands. Do you know what the hustlers would say to me after I lost? "Do you think you are playing with babies?"

I remember telling someone my rule of thumb that prices double on average every 10 years. They scoffed because that doesn't match the official inflation rate. But the public debt has to translate to inflation eventually, and that's pretty much doubled every 10 years.

Utility is keeping value away from The Man. Brand enables liquidity.
Those justify some reasonable BTC price.
Do they justify as high as $9k? No way. See chart below.

Understand what you're saying, but here's the thing. "True value" is a concept that is abstract at best, costly at worst. For example if you ever think that "true value" is different from current market value, there is someone who will take your trade and profit off you. Are they right about "true value", or are you?

Don't people think the most likely outcome is two coins listed on exchanges, much like happened with ETH ?

You say, "But again, a supermajority of hashpower and a large part of the economic majority have publicly pledged support for SegWit, so we should have no problem activating it on or before August 1."
The DCG signatories have chosen their preferred technical strategy. They haven't chosen Segwit alone. What they have chosen explicitly includes 2MB. Also the plan they have chosen is a clear refutation of the remaining Core devs. There is no political will among the majority of the hashpower to support the Core position any more, even if Core doesn't really support BIP148, it's too close to what Core previously wanted. Therefore I can't see there being much political will to support BIP148

When people say bubble, that's saying the same as: prices are going to retrace (or already have retraced) by a large amount... because otherwise it wouldn't be a bubble by definition, it would just be a market re-rating.
Here's the thing, people have this idea that prices moving very high, very fast necessarily leads to large % retracements. Where's the evidence for this? I've never seen any evidence of this.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:27:15
Segwit was designed to pacify the community temporarily, "we're working on scaling!" -- in the knowledge that it would always be far less than enough. If all that happens is Segwit, Bitcoin dies, and that's been Core's primary focus for years now.

Understand what you're saying but I never bought into that idea. I count my gains even if they are unrealized, so do most 401ks if you look at their calculated rate of return estimates
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:48:48
I'm not clear what evidence you have that actually thinking about investments produces better returns, for most people, other than it appears to be "common wisdom". What was that research about a monkey with a pin beating the stock market? We do know that trading has transactional costs, and that spending time on analysis has a time cost.

Not even an argument along with your ad hom = zero points!

Won't happen, author is simply wrong. Most of the hashpower that signed up for Segwit2x are not going to go for BIP148

Many thought (for two+ years after) that buying at the top at the end of 2013 was irrational exuberance. Turns out that buying at the top, ultimately still provided those investors with well-above average returns considering current prices.
