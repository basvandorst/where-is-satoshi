Thank you everyone for the responses! Love this community

Yikes not really. People that get taken advantage of are the ones that are in too deep/have weak hands and panic sell once the price drops. I'd consider myself pretty poor, but I've only put in what I can afford to lose and the whales haven't taken any of my bitcoin.

Was close to putting in a buy this morning at 12.8, thought I missed the gravy train when it hit 13.7 and finally got my order in at 11.9. What a ride

Hindsight is always 20/20. I almost pulled the trigger on a large purchase at 3.5k. Missed my chance and ended up getting in around 5.8k. Im not complaining, and neither will you when bitcoin hits new ATHs

You are certainly entitled to that opinion my dude

Shake off these weak hand pussies and keep on rising

You're on the bitcoin subreddit asking which coin to invest in... I think you know our answer

For the noobs asking if this is a good time to buy, it doesn't get any better than this. Fresh retrace from a rally

We may actually never see 4 digit prices ever again.. that's insane

According to my crystal ball, about 69 minutes from now

Tbh 1. inevitably becomes true just based on the fact that all fiat currencies devalue with inflation

13k we're back

Gold is the perfect example, what planet are you on? From the dollar off gold standard to now gold has gone from being worth $40/ounce to $1400. If you don't think that's USD devaluation then I don't know what else to say
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:38:54
In all honesty if you're not just laughing off a baby dip like this, you're in way too deep. Bigger drops are not off the table
@_date: 2019-12-12 07:18:29
looks scammy as hell.. just enter email and bitcoin deposit pops up? no ty lol
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:24:19
time 2 buy
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:27:33
Know your client basically you need to provide ID to buy any crypto with fiat
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:12:21
Sorry for your loss but lesson here is not to put all your savings in to bitcoin. And yea like the other person said, don't store it on an exchange
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:22:19
I don't like the complete control banks have.. but I'm not exactly balls deep in crypto either. We're in a transitional period and I think both are important in today's society. That may be completely different in a couple of decades but for now I'd say having a bank account is still quite necessary for day to day life
@_date: 2019-12-09 17:18:21
this is as good of an indicator as the shape of my morning shit

Today's the day I finally own my first bitcoin! Woo! Been contributing about 20% of my pay for the past year. I don't make much but hopefully this investment will bear fruit

What kind of bank are you using? There are plenty of banks out there that don't charge you monthly fees as long as you meet certain requirements

i have a ledger nano S but preordered the nano X. anyone have insight on what i should do with my S? are there any advantages of having multiple hardware wallets?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:57:16
Your guess is as good as mine. It's impossible to time the market unless you're manipulating it. That's why most people agree you should buy little by little. If it goes up, you win. If it goes down, you win because you get cheaper bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:14:08
Do a coinbase buy. Bought some during the 6250 pullback this morning and not regretting it
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:51:18
Only thing is, you can't deal in fiat on binance. Crypto to crypto only so if you wanna trade fiat put it into crypto first
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:45:18
Imagine of other countries saw this as a way to take the US down. The first country to buy into bitcoin will be a future superpower
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:53:01
Yea and then once you hit 1 coin you want to go for 2, then 3.. and so on. Buy what you can afford to lose and don't get greedy. Yea it would've been nice if I got in at 3k, but now I'm glad I got in at 5k
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:48:05
You can't deposit until some time tomorrow but once it opens up you can deposit as much as you want without verification. Just can't withdraw more than 2BTC/day without KYC on binance
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:41:44
Not if you withdraw less than 2BTC/day
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:26:39
Wow really? That bright circle coming up must be the moon then. Explains this price action

i guess what i'm really trying to say is no one can predict what bitcoin will do tomorrow. hindsight is always 20/20 and more often than not, you'll get burned trying to play the market
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:27:50
1. Get a wallet address (do your research on which ones are reputable)
2. Sign up for an account on an exchange that takes fiat money (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) 
3. Buy bitcoin(BTC). Not bitcoin cash, bitcoin diamond, bitcoin gold.. BITCOIN
4. Withdraw bitcoin to your wallet address
5. Keep your wallet private key safe
