I have no way of checking or finding out the public key.
I'm almost 100% certain that the coins are in there still... and yeah I do have what should be almost an exact copy of the password I used for this wallet.. 
I really did save it and secure it, this wallet went corrupt . It was a major failure.....

He didn't .. It was hard enough begging him to give me something.. All he gave me is a " encrypted string " to the wallet I had lost access to.

You think they are gone and lost? Its not the end of the world because I kind of figured this was the case.. Of course it would just be pretty cool to get that payout now that bitcoin is worth a lot more aha

Well I recently scraped up almost 10 BTC from when I was trading as a full time job back in 13-16 just from various wallets and electrum address's I randomly found stored in encrpyted files long forgotten... 
So of course when I remembered this POS wallet that cost me 4 BTC ( probably $2-3k back then ) . I decided to see if somebody could help me out. I didn't bother back then because 1k didn't seem worth it and I figured that this asshole company just fucked me out of coins....
But with the recent price of BTC it makes sense and now I will easily give 10k worth of this BTC to anybody willing to help me here... Now thats worth it and thats why I posted this.
If its gone its gone , I survived back then and its not like i just lost 30k of coin .

So the CEO told me that they couldn't help me, the wallet went down and they told everybody to move their coins.. Thats when I tried to log in using my password I know was correct and it kept giving me a end of string error.. I had access to the email used for the account the passwords for the account and access to it (until the app went down ) and even with all that he told me tough luck and told me to take to Reddit to try and find somebody to help me bruteforce it. I'm not exactly an expert in encryption or hashing so yeah maybe its my fault I didn't get all that info.. 
He said with the encrypted string I could bruteforce my way into the wallet to retrieve the coins... = / This was also back in 2015 though... Back then I was extremely angry and out of $3000 but now I just wonder if somebody could help get those coins out so we could both share the wealth of what I wrote off as a loss..
