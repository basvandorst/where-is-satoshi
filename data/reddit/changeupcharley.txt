Does it actually mean something beyond the strikingly cringey, couldn't-be-more-fucking-obvious, literal 5-year old comprehension level required definition when people tag shit with "Lower High" and "Price Drop Range" on charts like this?

Because someone that's working with someone with a 10bn portfolio, trying to sell him an idea, isn't going to call him condescending on public media. That's how you kick yourself out of the circle. This never happened.

There are some terrible groups of people in this country practicing their free speech by demanding a halt of free speech from others, or demanding that others speak in a fashion that fits the lowest common denominator. Look at the Linux CoC, for example. The latest abomination.

Sure. You posted an article that represents a Republican congressman that discusses his support for blockchain technology, enabling the use of it while protecting consumers from frivolous IRS situations, and de-regulating miners from having to register as "money transmitters".
That's de-regulation, and that's not authoritarianism. I would liken authoritarianism to someone wanting those tax dollars gobbled up in every way possible (a historically proven democratic faith), and telling you how you're going to use blockchain and cryptocurrency.
I believe that there can be laws that protect consumers, and the country, and still not be authoritarian. I really don't see how this is an authoritarian approach, unless you're going to tell me "well there should be no policy, period".
I hope that helps.
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:44:53
Republicans? Compared to Democrats? You've got to be joking. You just posted an article that is the exact opposite of what you just said to me.

Oh, opinions don't count to you when they're not spoonfed? That's your 2nd victim mentality, the first being your victim's lament surrounding bank adoption.
Bitcoin was built with scarcity for a reason, and just like everything in this world that has scarcity, the first to it are generally going to enjoy the benefits. You should quit with your utopian fantasies and become MUCH more realistic about the real future of this shit.

The power of septum rings and twitter couldn't bring enough strength to have an affect on adoption from happening, no matter how badly you want the adoption to proceed exactly as you desire. "Play how I want you to, or be gone!" is not how decentralized ANYTHING works.

While I appreciate your compassion for others, to say that they are all without 99% of their own blame, is you lying to yourself, and excusing everyone else that fails, too.

Look man, since you're so skeptical of the people telling you it's an obvious scam, why don't you just do it, and come back and tell us how well it's all working? Take referral fees from all of us so we can get in on it too.
I'm telling you right now-- you're going to lose everything. He's probably going to ask you to register on some private site with an email and password too, and once he has that, he's going to log into every common account known to man that doesn't have phone-based 2fa, and take what he can from you there, too. People don't have anything to offer you, when it comes to making money. Did a genie lamp pop out from under your pillow late last night?

Ok, I'll connect them. The people who want universal healthcare also don't want to increase their own tax contribution to make it happen, they want any tax bracket but their own to cover it all for them.

An ETF is adoption, stop treating it like more than that. It doesn't stop you from maintaining any of the qualities of Bitcoin as you use it today.
So many of you talk about how "impenetrable" Bitcion/blockchain is, and then you fear-sell adoption when mass adoption becomes a topic. You're hypocritical beyond your own comprehension.

What you've expressed so far is that you believe theoretical Quora articles to be fact, even after the writer ends the article with a disclaimer that none of what he wrote is more than a theory, and also that you've experienced an AI dominated economy.

Well, you're right, but there are also plenty of cases where your account was hacked because your exchange, or wallet "daddy", or other various entities that you relied on failed to maintain security, so it's not 100% on the individual that desires to maintain security.

I didn't ask for lessons, I asked you to prove why your theory-based sources and this supposed AI/Automation economy that you've never seen, touched, lived in, or otherwise are credible. You avoided the shit out of the 2 things you need to validate for people to believe you, so it's obvious that you think that anyone that questions you is now an "angry AnCap"? Stop changing the subject. Nobody said they don't know what UBI is, or why it's useful, etc. That was never the problem. Also, if you had more than a fucking Quora article, and a Richard Branson statement for sources, you wouldn't be deflecting, so it just becomes more obvious that you've made your mind up on UBI just because it sounds nice to you. Typical shit, no new behavior here.
Richard Branson is far less full of shit than you, so far, you're not going to gain much by using him as your scapegoat.
