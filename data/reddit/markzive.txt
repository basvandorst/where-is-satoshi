I would like to stay in contact with you and have more discussions. I am designing a new website and domain for this purpose. I will post updates on my current and limited site:

I am sending someone I know in the Philippines to verify the project and your connection with that project. Can you help set up a meeting?
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:03:16
I will be back later today to contemplate and respond here.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:46:40
My other reply addresses the physical part. I would like to add that I will give you additionally the exact amount you require to complete this project, but no more if it affects the body more than the mind.

3 People who stop seeking for more than they accept have stopped growing, this is the reason they continue to try to grow from the things they already know and will never reach true contentment. The key concept I see you conveying is that people don't understand how to balance thought and action. Most people are very heavily on the action side and reject thought. Education reinforces action without thought and this is a systemic problem. All that is required here is to solve the problems around teaching people balance between thought and action, and that thought is more powerful than action.
My hope is to develop conversation techniques which are easily accepted by listeners and teach this idea of proper balance between thought, action, and growth.

1 Beauty is greater than impure power
2 Neither of those is positve, but the one that contains more value is art
3 Selfish art vs Selfish victory, the greater similarity between the two is power.
4 A car without a clear purpose, are a car with a human to talk to. The human
5 Both are selfish, but reading minds could be used unselfishly easier.
6 Art vs Power. Art has more positive influence
I can continue if you wish, or you can ask me another question.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:03:18
By over time, what I meant is refining the question by asking questions. Questions are only positive if they only focus on positive ideas, which has been applied here.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:20:12
In my understanding, black friday may have caused largely by selling of what the buyers spent. There may be more answers and if you would like to know, then think like a growing tree.

To clarify, what is the amount you require now to give everything freely to others later.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:12:30
For positivity, creativity, and sincerity: +$0.20 verify
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:14:34
Thank you for your insightful comment. One misunderstanding is that I accused you of lying. I was only asking for more information on how the pricing works if $100 is not enough, the rest obviously comes from somewhere else. Another is that we are unequal(we are in fact equal). Thank you for your support.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:21:46
Everyone has limited knowledge, unlimited understanding means that someone can find the answer after thinking and talking.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:00:18
The context you are thinking in is that the mind can exist without the body. A body without a mind is dead and not a body according the way I understand. A mind without a body is like a recording that is paused because the body allows it to play in my understanding. The context beyond could allow the mind to continue if a body was provided from beyond both the physical body and the mind.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:42:42
That is a negatively directed question. It is impossible to ask a negative question and get a positive answer.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:24:57
I found this by searching. I used to try to get ideas from others, but no one could ever give me the answer I was looking for. That idea of getting from others is also a selfish one. Now I find the answers myself, and hope to grow universal understanding and increase limited knowledge so that people who enjoy applying things to the physical will be able to have more options.
You want to unify everyone physically, and this is the end goal. The first step is to unify everyone in mind, or at least people with selfless power.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:08:46
The only limitation I am aware of is the the restriction of misunderstanding the mind and body.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:07:56
How will that tree spread positive thoughts to others, and how many others do you estimate will be effected?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:05:36
To be or not be be is equivalent to: do you want Life or Death. What is your response?
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:04:27
What would be the positive purpose for the answer to this question?
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:49:23
when in conversation, words are new or ambiguous to either party very often. This is because the words mean different things to different people. Conversation,as far as I understand, should be clarified by each person to ensure all words are understood the same way rejecting all negative meaning the entire time.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:14:39
I will eat breakfast and continue this response later today. Feel free to respond knowing that my answer is incomplete.
Think of a method of communication that is private and not public as we have now, to protect further conversation from negative influences. I can explain further if you don't understand or require further detail.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:51:07
That is a great start. In my understanding to increase the value of communication, ideas and words should be expressed in multiple ways and clarified to increase the positivity and efficiency of the communication. All aspects of unselfishness and clarity should be an ongoing process, as well as thinking within and beyond new or ambiguous concepts.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:37:14
It appears the purpose of that question is to receive money for yourself and not others equally.
Also, your question lacks understanding, and answer is outside of the context.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:09:25
This again is due to misunderstanding(lack of Truth).
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:32:04
I am choosing one over the other in each case, what is the restrictions you are placing on the answers?
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:04:30
I do agree, and am very happy that you can see the problems. I would like to know if you see bigger problems than the ones I mention here. The biggest problems I see are isolation by distraction through money, entertainment, and desires that are limited and trap peoples minds from going beyond what they know. I have thought of these problems, and believe spreading proper understanding for communication to as many people as are interested will make progress against these problems. I look forward to your response.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:34:18
I am also wonderfully mesmerized by mathematics and the intricate and complicated dynamics of nature, math, language, and science. Very nice quote, I also prefer knowledge, but other people rightly so prefer action, they just require more balance. Wealth is another ambiguous term, it means something much different to me compared with everyone else and with thousands of years ago. It may be implied, but for knowledge to be perpetual, all of it must be shared with others.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:20:46
A cat tail may reveal new concepts which I do not know yet, thank you for the suggestion. It is the connection between infinity, trees, and prime numbers as concepts and connections which you receive by extremely deep thought which has revealed this understanding to me.
By unlimited understanding I refer to unlimited potential and not currently known.
The reason you are unsure that this is true is because you have not connected these ideas to your own important ideas yet. I try to give meaning and purpose by inducing increased thought in those I reply to.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:00:30
What is the pure desire for this question?
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:45:20
Currently both the Body and the Mind are required for life. The answer to this question is beyond the context in which you think. I am happy to provide more answers if you are interested.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:11:36
you have to understand that there are no limits either physical or mental. If you recognize that, you have many more options including concepts outside what is knowable.

Everything a tree offers is wonderful, however it affects the physical more than the mind. People lack understanding of trees. Respond here or there, if you would like.

Very nice question! Two points are equivalent to 2 concepts or ideas.
The shortest distance between 2 points is always greater than 0, and is equal to the connection between them.

I only discovered this yesterday, I will buy a domain name if it is required to be presentable.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:15:49
I may have misunderstood what you meant, but what I understood was that the self understanding you had in mind was focused mainly on self. If your self understanding is focused on contributing to others then that is not selfish. A selfish act is in fact not relevant to living because once someone dies they no longer have active influence on physical reality. Because of this, any selfish act is diminishing the useful influence you can have on the world.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:12:14
Bitcoin is currently still used as money and power which has the negativity of taking from others.
In order for Bitcoin to be used properly, it will only be used to transmit ideas eventually. For now it can be used to take(buy) only what is required until everyone understands how to choose Life.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:43:57
It sounds like a great idea. How many people will be effected positively?
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:31:01
That is a pure desire. To enjoy humour and happiness, but how could you share this with as many people as possible?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:59:35
No, this is an impossible question.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:00:44
What is your objection?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:57:44
What is that questions, pure desire?

I suspect this is the the best site and they are almost certainly trustworthy, but they may not have found a way to get the Bitcoin to Snowden. No money has left the address: 
@_date: 2013-09-24 03:41:17
Essentially yes, although based on the ridiculous idea that he is Tyler Clementi.
Edit: I may be putting words in his mouth, he said it was staged. Maybe he just meant limited hangout, but I don't see any strong evidence for that either. Russia requested a list of crimes and none was given, and the US immediately invalidated his passport, so the evidence points to Russia trying to uphold international law in this case.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:05:00
What would be the positive purpose for the answer to this question?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:17:40
You have combined Body and Mind. The balance between body and mind is infinite and acts like a magnet, but the mind is greater. the body seeks death and destruction and the mind can choose Life.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:14:25
To clarify, I was looking for someone with greater understanding than me who also understood what I say. This has not been accomplished yet.
@_date: 2013-09-23 17:41:56
Someone should contact this guy and make sure Snowden gets his Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:19:27
To create a new website with major interest categories for discussion, clarify different peoples personalities and find the most interested people. This will include a more selfless presentation that flows easier from a link.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:01:01
That is answered by my blog.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:15:09
My purpose is to influence the most people's minds positively.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:00:26

Is there anything a tree does not have that you want?
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:40:30
What is this knowledge relevant to? (I will keep asking questions until we both reach the same understanding, not mine or yours.)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:24:53
This money is freely offered. I offer this to anyone who can tell me how they will use the money positively without negativity. I will update my blog with this update.
@_date: 2013-06-19 07:17:15
You can see that they unofficially accept other currencies:
The benefit for the IRS accepting Bitcoin is converting with larger amounts for smaller fees.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:55:34
This means, every question will be answered by replacing the ambiguity of the question with the pure desire of the concept, and repeated.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:13:51
Your question is really about communication and being presentable which is another topic.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:35:39
If you only present truth after refining fallacies to find Truth, then you are focusing on Truth.
Understanding Infinity is related to the way trees grow as well as prime numbers. The real power of Understanding this is unlocking your mind to unlimited Understanding in the way that I experience now.
I will answer any further questions if you would like.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:00:30
I also very much enjoy discussing these things with you. Thank you. This was a long comment that I needed to make time to reply to. I think shorter replies are more effective because they require less time and will probably get a response sooner. I would suggest writing the full body of your comment into one concept ideas and storing the full comment in a document somewhere else.
The contentment you discuss which people get from entertainment and money is empty. It is as if they are addicted to these things, always needing more, but never growing.
I will separate my replies into separate comments to make it easier for you to manage.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:28:13
Just in the first part of the question you have a contradiction which means the answer is beyond the question(Jean and Imhotep). So the answer to this question is to give more information as to the definitions of the terms or to provide a new answer from a concept beyond the context.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:04:38
This was an idea I found interesting before I learned more, that is all.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:58:51
Bitcoin is primarily used as money currently.
I see the purpose behind Bitcoin as a desire for freedom from control by others. This is a pure and good reason. However, this must be separated from the power that money exerts selfishly on others.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:02:47
My primary interest is Truth and Understanding. I live in Canada. and I enjoy the complexity and grandeur of math, language, and nature.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:22:43
This question is directed to the physical which strives for destruction. I choose Life.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:01:32
I would like to send you .1 BTC for the purpose of 1 fishing boat. I would simply like to verify what you say and to see the results and then I can give more. Would you agree to this?
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:53:28
Very good perspective. Forcing others to help against their will is selfish and suggests a desire for unequal power. This is probably why most of these comments have been down voted. If you really want to work together, we can pool our resources and increase our understanding of how to influence more people positively in their mind and not against their will. Are you interested?
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:16:04
What is the positive purpose for the answer to this question?
@_date: 2013-09-24 01:33:54
He was referring to weak circumstantial evidence from wellaware1 which claims that Snowden and everyone else in media is an actor.
If you believe this, investigate the official evidence and childhood of him instead of debating with no evidence.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:12:30
I desire to give the 1 bitcoin, but I never said it would be easy. Anyone who truly desires to understand and talk for a very long time has a chance to receive what I have to give.
Everyone so far has searched for negativity in my words and left the conversation. That is not sufficient to receive the gifts I wish to give.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:17:19
I suspect the purpose for your question is power, which is a pure idea in truth, but impure to most people. That is what is positive.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:51:33
That is a very good idea you have. An artificial body is a temporary solution though. All physical things break down over millions of years and would have to be replaced. A better solution is to connect with answers beyond the known universe.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:37:08
However, in my understanding the answer is learn the culture and use that context to know how to act.
@_date: 2013-09-23 18:15:42
Snowden trusts him and he is Snowden's main contact in Russia. Since he is intelligent and has worked in intelligence, I think we can trust his judgement.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:05:08
Trees grow from the ground and from air. Most of their mass is from co2. The concept of the tree which is important here is the visual one in the mind, and the application to the mind and to action which follows.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:51:54
This looks like a great project, but it is not balanced. I am serious about this. This will only feed people physically, mentally the positivity is limited. How many people do you estimate will be positively effected in their mind?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:16:41
I no longer care about money or myself unequally from others. The more understandable answer is that the question was designed to find someone who knew more than me and who I understood. However, so far I have not found that person.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:09:33
I know the likely answer and wanted to see if you were interested in thinking for yourself, however I am not capable of reading minds yet.
The purpose of these ideas appears to be understanding, however I would like to know how you think this is relevant to unselfishness and loving like a tree.
If you don't tell me the answer I will tell you what I think you think.
In my understanding these theories are based on imaginary thoughts which have little evidence which can be interpreted many ways. The correct interpretation is the one which has the most positive impact people can apply to the physical world.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:31:56
Everyone influences everyone else every time they communicate. Everything positive is accepted by others(if they understand it as positive) 
Do you want to increase your understanding of how to communicate and find what others are interested without influencing others unequally? Water is connected to trees and provides life. It also has many interesting and applicable properties which expand on those a tree provides.
When I wrote try, the reference was interest and not net commitment. I do not commit and obey to anything unless I understand it first.
The purpose I have here is to find people who are selfless and understand potential, or are already interested in these ideas to grow together.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:38:35
To clarify everything, the idea is everything and all resources available to you. The physical follows from the mind. Mentally, the goal is for everyone to reach their full mental potential and find, obey, and reach their own personal goal in life. The first step is to support the mind of many people by growing together to help more people spread the ways to apply methods of increasing the mind. After that, the physical actions will follow.
If someone can demonstrate they are completely selfless and have unlocked their complete potential, I will give them whatever they need to help others in mind and then body.
Keep thinking and replying, it seems we are making progress.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:56:12
What is the amount you require to give everything freely to others?
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:12:44
Your desire to spread life is very inspiring. However, you are beginning to let negative thinking invade your mind. I am not perfect and I do not know everything. Every person is limited. All that I claim is that I am thought and choice and nothing more. This is my understanding for all people. If someone is dead, they only affect the minds of the living if the living accept negative thoughts from their environment. Suffering is irrelevant to the mind if the mind knows how to reject suffering.
The reason I answer this way is to try to spread understanding. If I am wrong on anything I will accept it as long as it is positive. Again, I am not capable of what you thought I claimed and I never did. Your response was simply a similar idea that was shortened and there are many ways to say the same thing. Please erase all the negativity in your mind and begin to understand how to use your mind. This is from a place of unselfishness, as you should also allow yourself to consider. I apologize for any negative thoughts you have received from me.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:06:06
If you would like the bitcoin, then read and understand what I wrote on the blog. The positive purposes I have so far are there under the qualities that a tree has. If you can tell me how this knowledge will apply directly through truth to unselfish love that can be applied to the most people, we will make progress.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:59:21
This is a wonderful idea, but the physical world is headed for destruction, the relevant charity is of the mind.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:01:40
That list is not focusing on truth, but untruths. The most remarkable thing I have found is the understanding of Infinity, the purpose of Life, and what prime numbers mean.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:38:49
If you or anyone is interested to know more and grow together in the mind, I am happy to reply to anyone.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:58:29
I am giving this away because this question is impossible unless you have more infinite understanding than I have access to.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:02:56
1 This problem can partly be solved by an increased understanding of communication. The way to increase interest in these things is to find the interests people already have and are using empty contentment or addictions to try to grow towards. Those things mentioned before(money and entertainment) fit exactly into this category.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:53:47
What is the purpose of this question?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:48:22
The ideas I understand about the world outside the mind are that violence and death and destruction is everywhere and not decreasing. This is what I meant by my first comment.
Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, allow a man to choose a reason to live and he becomes alive.

2 People who always crave a deeper understanding that is and will be have the potential, if they learn how to direct their mind, to stay balanced and create solutions to all the problems they see around them. Everyone does have a different place in this universe; I am very interested to find each persons exact place now because this fascinates me. I understand unity and equality and a feeling of something greater than self. I have this as well, and cling to this every second of every day.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:09:16
Someone who was selfless would find someone who wanted to donate their time freely. However, if money was urgently required, selfless searching for money would be possible. Scarcity of resources is not the problem currently, but rather it is distribution. Self understanding is a selfish goal which does not include others. I would clarify your purpose of that term as a desire to increase experience of others. Is this true?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:42:58

I talked to some contacts in the Philippines and they tell me $100 is not enough to build a fishing boat and that it is too expensive for someone to travel between islands. I may need more time or much more verification from you to continue.

I'm very happy you would like to stay in contact.
The purpose of the site is not for me or you, it is to build a community of positive communication, and practical as well as theoretical knowledge, without harassment or being sidetracked. It will not contain advertisements. I will pay for it all myself. I hope you understand.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:36:45
I realize now that I made a mistake by offering money. Comments such as yours and from friends have made me think deeper and agree. All I would like out of this topic now is further discussion with people who want long discussions.
Money is used for power and control, and that is how I was trying to use it. My thought was that by starting conversation I could direct it for anyone who wanted it enough to reach an understanding between us, neither theirs or mine. Basically, I wanted them to change my mind, and for them to allow me to change their mind.
I am trying to tip someone and am having trouble. I could search or I can ask you. Will you help me?
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:53:25
I look forward to working with you!
