Purely as a personal stance, I do believe in trying to change the system from the inside out.  I recognize this may be impossible, but I have my reasons.
Chief among them is this: I am a militant pacifist. I recognize that sometimes, violence is the only option left on the table.  However, I think it's crucially important for someone to be there, looking under the table to make sure nothing got knocked off in all the shouting.  Violence too easily loses sight of its original goals, however noble.  It too easily accepts collateral damage as inevitable or even desirable.  Someone has to make damned sure it really is the last resort, lest violence become the tool of those too lazy to try anything else.  Who will abuse it to elevate themselves.
Hell, maybe, just maybe, someday we'll get rid of this pernicious idea of force and the world will be a better place for it.  Not counting on it, not so long as we remain *homo sapiens*.
I know it isn't a position for everyone.  I'm sure I'm going to get downvoted for this.  I'm alright with that.

Whine about the good old days when you didn't have to explain a concept.  A concept that says people who don't understand it will be coming.  So, you either don't understand it or you're an elitist prick who just wants to whine and seem important.
I thought the former at first, but I'm willing to revise my opinion.

Wow. Ok. EVEN MORE BLUNT VERSION: I don't think you actually understand things.

That was early on in the adoption cycle, wasn't it?

I didn't make price predictions.  You might want to start checking usernames.  
Definitely a prick.

You shouldn't confuse legality and morality.  The laws exist.  Violation of those laws is a crime.  Locking him up for violating the law is consistent with the law, therefore not a crime.
If you want to say that it's *wrong*, that's an entirely different thing.  And you know what? If you live in a democracy (or a democratic republic), sometimes you're going to disagree with the law.  That's ok.  You're perfectly free to do that.  You're free to try to change the law.  You can ignore the law if you like, but if you get caught you'll face the consequences of having committed a crime.
If you want to change the laws, *do something*.  Donate bitcoins to the ACLU or the SPLC or whatever organization best addresses your specific concerns.  Volunteer.  You might not succeed, but your chance of failure is 100% if you don't try.

I don't think placebo means what you think it means.  It's actually the opposite of what you seem to be saying.  The placebo effect is when a false therapy (such as a sugar pill without any active ingredients) produces a measurable effect on a patient's health.  
Far from being sham ways to placate the masses, if guilt and innocence were placebos, they would still produce meaningful judicial outcomes.

Might point was that you ought to have expected more and more users who know less and less when they start to adopt.  The technically savvy or knowledgeable people would tend to be the early adopters, not form the majority waves.

If that's what you meant, you should have lead with that, instead of:




By all means, after you.

I wasn't aware that [congestive heart failure, epillepsy, food allergies, herpes simplex symptoms, and ulcers]( were considered unmeasurable phenomena.  
The definition of "brainwash" is


Synonyms include indoctrinate, condition, reeducate, persuade, influence, propagandize, and inculcate.   To call the placebo effect brainwashing is to dramatically understate what brainwashing actually is.  Kidnapping someone, locking them in a closet, and telling them you're their friend until they believe you is brainwashing.  Giving them a pill that contains 25 mg less active ingredient than they think it does is... rather an entirely different prospect.
Edit: If you do think self-reported pain is "unmeasurable", you should (re?)familiarize yourself with a few diagnostic tools used in pain management:
[Trigger points, also called 'jump sign',]( are used to diagnose back pain.  Touching the trigger point causes the patient to involuntarily jerk or jump, which is why it's called jump sign.
[Phalen's maneuver]( is used to diagnose nerve pain and muscle weakness in the upper extremities (i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome).  As is [Tinel's sign](  
I'm sure there are others, but it's been years since I worked for an anesthesiologist and I can't remember them.

Price predictions have nothing to do with what I said or why I said it.  You might want to look into that whole reading thing yourself.

What, exactly, is my recommended recourse? To do something? Like giving money to groups fighting against encroachment against our civil liberties.  Like volunteering to do things. Those are low-risk things you can do.  I also mentioned ignoring and breaking the law, with the caveat that those are high-risk.
You can hold them in all the contempt you like.  But I object to the attempts in this thread and elsewhere in this subreddit to redefine reality based on personal beliefs.  Regardless of what you think of the system, it exists.  What counts as a crime in book is irrelevant unless he gets enough people to think it's a crime in their books, too.  Calling me out as a statist or simply decrying the state of affairs on a fucking website counts for jack shit in the real world.
Which is why I advocated *doing something*.

Fair enough.  I wasn't sure if there was a way to blacklist addresses that receive funds from a blacklisted address automatically, or if the exchange would have to track that manually. If they just refuse to accept a coin that's passed through a blacklisted address... hm.  I could see that biting the community in the ass.  Could the owner of the illicit coins could send funds to wallets they *want* to see shut down?

Neither "Dude it's 2015" nor "So we land on a comete but we couldn't find a way to open a letter without any trace?" is actually a relevant argument.  Just so you know.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:28:04
Is there some reason the owner of the address couldn't create as many new addresses as they liked? Just shuffle the coins around from address to address, unloading until each new address gets blacklisted.

If you think something is important enough to argue about, you should really bother yourself to argue a little better.  It's not a technicality if your arguments are *completely unrelated* to what you're arguing about.
