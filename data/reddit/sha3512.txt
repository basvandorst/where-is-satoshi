Yes. is incorrect. A 51% attacks allows all blocks to be mined by the attacker, provided the attacking pool is willing to violate the standard rules of mining. A miner is always supposed to work on the most recently completed block. If they don't, and they have less than 50%, they go broke because most of their effort will be wasted on blocks which will never be added to the chain.
But if they have &gt;50%, they can choose to mine exclusively on their own blocks, orphaning any blocks found first by other people/pools. Their pool will always catch up and orphan other most-recent blocks because they generate blocks at a faster rate.

Maybe. But just as easily there could be run *to* the pool, because at that point not only would only Ghash miners would reap any rewards, but in fact they'd reap rewards out of proportion to the hashing power they'd have in a fair scenario.

More or less, the meeting itself is not the primary concern. The meeting is just to help them determine if you're delinquent on your taxes or not, but they can and will do that on their own if you fail to show up.
If they decide you are delinquent, they can and will order you to pay back taxes and fines. If you don't pay, you'll get charged with various tax crimes. If you're in Mexico, they'll ask the Mexican government for your extradition, and by treaty Mexico will in fact extradite you.
Look, get a lawyer. They can give you much better advice than you'll get on Reddit, and if you're at the point where you're seriously considering fleeing the country you need the best advice you can get.

Watts are a unit of power, kWh is a unit of energy. Everything past that point is wrong. This is why professors are sticklers about this sort of thing.
Anyway, "watts" should be "joules", which would convert to about 462 kWh. Thus the estimated price from this post is too high by a factor of 360ish.

Yes, but the problem is not that the honest miner makes 0 BTC. It's that he makes less BTC than he would if he were a member of the dishonest pool. This gives him an incentive to join that pool, which makes the pool even more profitable compared to the honest miners, leading to a vicious circle.

I don't know, but in principle a handshake between the managers of BTC Guild and GHash.IO would result in a pool containing 49% of the hashing power right this moment.
But also remember that a 51% attack isn't necessarily the end of the protocol. It allows them to pick which blocks they want to include, but they can't forge transactions or realistically reverse transactions which have already happened.

If one block is found every 10 minutes on average, the [exponential distribution]( can be used to find the probability of a block being found in under a minute. It turns out to be about 9.5%. The probability of two consecutive blocks being found in under a minute should be that probability squared, or a bit under one percent. As about 1000 blocks a week are mined, we should expect to see two-blocks-in-one-minute happen several times a week.

Excellent work. To explain a little further, pretend that the three largest current mining pools joined forces and worked as a single pool. At that point [they'd have about 63%]( of the total hashing power. There's then two options:
1. The pool behaves honestly, and as a result mines about 63% of the blocks and gets a corresponding percentage of the block rewards and transaction fees.
2. The pool behaves dishonestly, ignores the bitcoin standard requirement that mining immediately begin on the newest valid block, and the pool only mines on top of blocks they created. If a newer block is mined by someone else, they ignore it and continue on their own fork. Because they have more than half of the hashing power and are able to create blocks faster than everyone else combined, eventually their fork will always be the longest. They thus mine 100% of blocks, block rewards, and transaction fees. The blocks mined by others end up orphaned.
In short, OP is wrong. If the "selfish miner" attack fails, it won't be for the reason he postulates.
