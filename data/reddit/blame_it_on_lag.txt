Locked in some mad losses right there props to you
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:45:10
im Lost, how does that clue help?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:33:45
probably because the BCH difficulty scaling is super broken and instead the intended 6 blocks per hour BCH is mining upwards of 30 per hour
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:21:39
No, still funny
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:59:01
Um yea that is exactly what the title says, since LTC blocks are every 2.5 min and they are 1mb each that equals 4mb per 10 minutes, where BCH is currently only 2mb every 10 minutes
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:00:57
Um you spelled downgrade wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:02:03
and look at how much it just dropped in 1 day
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:48:58
He isnt a hero, however the punishment is egregious, and seeing as how judges often use precedents for future cases, people convicted of similar, or lesser crimes similar to his could suffer ridiculously unfair sentences

you can do it on coinbase using a credit card without ID, however to get money back after selling you will need to id verify
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:45:29
I think not
@_date: 2017-07-04 02:33:58
I mean a rainbow table is a start but still would take a while to go thought all of those
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:56:16
no no no he said he would eat his own dick, what kind of people would we be if we didnt help him keep his word
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:26:26
no he said there is no limit to the number of digital currencies that can be created, not there is no limit to the number of bitcoins that can be created
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:30:18
It is definitely more likely, but only time will tell
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:43:03
revelation of what spam attacks?
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:23:42
buy high sell low the golden rule of investing
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:00:32
how will it never be solved, it is either one or the other so all you have to do is show a mathematical proof proving it to be one or the other.  Will it be easy? hell no, but it is not impossible
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:22:39
well I dont think this guy has to worry about his arrest destroying his business, he did that himself.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:03:56
I strongly disagree, if your stupid enough to lose a bet where your wager was your own dick you clearly shouldn't be reproducing anyway
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:21:25
that is because some major pools are not going to start signaling support until the 21st, when it is suppose to start
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:18:46
That is not how this meme works
@_date: 2017-07-04 02:38:58
it would take that with modern technology, however there are 2 things to consider.  First quantum computers are being developed, which have astronomically higher speeds.  And second human kind has never actually proved the N vs NP problem so if it shows that N=NP then everyones private key would be compromised instantly
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:55:41
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:25:17
yea lets just break all the laws we don't like instead of creating petitions and electing officials who hold our viewpoints to try to change them, hell while we are at it i think we should just declare anarchy and go around killing everyone
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:47:34
yea sure whatever
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:50:23
no no no your reaction is all wrong your suppose to be like "WOW", and then just sit there with your mouth wide open for a couple minutes
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:20:43
yes so by as soon as 2030 the dollar will have -90% value, so in essence the dollar bill will turn into a debt note, the more you own the more you owe the government, the poor will become the rich and the rich will become the poor, big changes are ahead
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:15:20
honestly for something minor like that coinbase shouldn't give you any problems
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:17:55
there doesn't seem to be anything here
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:49:46
yea pepes are pretty undervalued, however i believe doge is in a bubble
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:45:11
um what, a system of rules without rulers aka a republic or democracy and a murderer can not in any way shape or form possibly be confused with each other as they are in no way similar at all, not only was my comment meant as a joke but your reply is so hopelessly confusing i feel like you just babble nonsense and pray that what you say makes at least a sliver of sense in the end
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:42:47
honestly if gdax had dogecoin i would defiantly buy it memes and crypto together are a powerful force
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:07:01
yup just read it looks like they are following it just fine to me
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:29:27
Its nice but you may want to add some more decimal points, when i changed the currency to bitcoin all the products just said 0 BTC
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:03:28
just scroll down a little and you can see a gif saying "Stop my penis can only get so erect".
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:09:59
Um actually it is followed by the government, that's the whole point of the judicial branch, and yes sometimes legislative branch passes laws that violate the constitution, but that is because if they didnt pass them they would look bad, lets say there is a bill coming up in the house for not allowing people to carry guns within 500 feet of a school, a clear violation of the second amendment.  However if a representative did not vote for that when reelection came around his opponents would say this guy supports carrying guns near our schools which would almost certainly means he would not get reelected.  This law would then get overturned in court if a case came up against it. TLDR: politics is complicated
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:46:18
If all those eraser marks dont show how volatile this currency is I dont know what does.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:41:08
Let me post the definition of anarchy for you because you clearly don't know it.  Anarchy is defined as "a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority".  Anarchy does not mean "without rulers" it means without "enforced rules".  Since democracies enforce their rules they are not anarchy.
Nice Affirming the Consequent logical fallacy though. =:)
