Well duh but he's not going to say that obviously :)  
His answer of "too complex" is pretty funny.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:36:02
That comes across as bullshit to be perfectly honest. What are the negative impacts of this "overly complex solution"?  How does it do any harm?  
The simple problem you're referring to is the transaction malleability fix I assume? Because if you think transaction throughput is a "simple problem" then it really isn't worth the time to converse with you (assuming you believe decentralization and censorship resistance is the most important aspects of bitcoin).  
With transaction malleability being a simple problem - why hasn't BCH fixed it?

I still don't understand the centralizing effect lightning network will have ( this is what that the BCH folks keep telling me). They just kinda state it as fact and don't really explain how.

@_date: 2018-01-10 21:43:24
Prioritizing launching bch will do you no favors if you care about the goodwill and support of bitcoiners. If Bread really cares about not "letting their customers down" then launching an alt/shitcoin on what (we thought) was a BITCOIN app is incredibly foolish imo. Why not dedicate those resources to figuring out how Bread will support/integrate LN which is pretty clearly the future?  
Q: what are your personal thoughts on bitcoin cash vs the lightning network?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:23:56
One of the bigger benefits for me (atm) is the ability to deposit/withdraw quickly and cheaply from online sportsbooks with the real benefit being no chance of having my cc info / identity / etc stolen (fairly common with online sportsbooks).

Why kiss BTC goodbye? As far as I know my coins will be completely safe until a time when LN goes live.  At which point I will begin transacting with it cheaply.  
I personally have zero issue using an alt for payments until this time. I currently use BTC as a store of value and other than the price going down (I bought in when bitcoin was much cheaper so this doesn't really bother me) I don't see any issue.  I want to put most of my crypto wealth in the blockchain that I think has the best chance to scale long-term.

Routing yes (in terms of it still being early with lots of kinks to work out). KYC/AML on lightning "hubs" no. I've heard/read enough people I trust and respect like Nick Szabo, Antonopolos, Adam Back, etc that say it's bullshit to not bother.

I have a hard time believing this is a genuine question. No one gives a fuck if someone hardforks bitcoin to have bigger blocks. All the power to them - it's an open source project. People lose their shit if you market that fork of bitcoin as...the real bitcoin.  
This isn't complicated.

I've had the conversation with friends IRL a few times. I don't really ever need to appeal to authority directly I don't think. I can explain what lightning does, just not exactly how it does it. I've found (non-technical) people don't really care about the how, just the what.  
I do not feel like I am participating in propaganda during these conversations.

I am convinced that the folks who frequent r/btc are either paid to do so or are the dumbest group of humans alive.

Not sure "wrong" is the correct term to use. Youtube is "easy" to consume.  
I'm sitting here at my computer at work. I want to listen to podcast y through my softphone. I google the podcast episode number, followed by "youtube" and click the first link. I minimize the window and let the pdocast play in the background. Am I listening on the "wrong" platform if it is the easiest for me?  
And yea it's a fantastic conversation definitely worth the listen. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:34:20
My point was that the statement "All of those things that were to be used to harm or defraud another were explicitly disallowed by Silk Road" is extremely misleading. He just separated guns etc to a different website.
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:02:15
Nothing as far as I can tell. I don't concern myself with the semantics of such things.  
What do you consider audio recordings on youtube with no video and just a static image showing (some audio-only podcasts do this just as another medium of exposure).
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:04:50
There are not "two sides of bitcoin". There is bitcoin, and there is forks of bitcoin. BCH is one of many. BCH is simply the most scammy in their deceptive marketing as "the real bitcoin".

@_date: 2018-05-03 20:02:50


Probably yah. Bitcoin for sure. But can you be so certain about BCH? Obviously the chances of this happening are very slim: but what would you think happens if Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and Craig Wright all made public statements that BCH was a failed project and they no longer support/mine or dedicate any resources towards it in any way.  
Probably not going to happen but what would happen if it does? Is bitcoin susceptible to the same risk (3 individuals disavowing it and thus likely killing it). I don't think so.

@_date: 2018-10-18 20:45:00
Wish you success. Well not actually considering in my view bch is actively working to undermine bitcoin... but yeah whatever good luck I guess. You at least don't seem completely out of touch with reality and as far as I can tell aren't trying to brainwash ignorants with less-than-factual info.    
While I have your attention I'm curious - does it worry you a bit that (at least in my city - Toronto) there are very few people who actually support and own bitcoin cash? Like I talk with crypto people regularly in TO and have yet to meet a single person IRL who believes in the long term future of bch. I meet way more people that believe in fucking Ripple lol. 
It seems like for bitcoin cash to have a hope of success - the lightning network must fail. At this point I think it is extraordinarily naive to think the LN devs won't solve the remaining issues and increase the UX to the point it is at least as easy, if not easier the onchain transactions.

Looking at amazon it appears a trezor is $260 (cad) not $60.  If it was only 60 it would make it a much easier choice.
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:11:37
Huh, figured it would be pointless to implement without segwit.  
also: didn't I hear in a recent debate (I think with Jimmy Song?) that you don't consider yourself a bch developer? Do you just help them with some copy/paste work now and then?

@_date: 2018-10-19 20:27:52
Sorry to bother you again, but I had a thought/question...  
It is very possible I am being naive to think LN will have its outstanding issues solved eventually. Afterall, I can't read of a lick of code and am utterly unable to evaluate things based on their technical merit.  
But my question is: what of the 10+ smart/accomplished/respected developers devoting their lives and working full time on Lightning? Developers the caliber of waxwing, roasbeef, etc (in my understanding) aren't exactly a dime a dozen and I have a reeeeally hard time imagining those guys spending countless hours (years) on something they aren't pretty damn convinced they will make work well...eventually. Do you think they're all wasting their time? Are the outstanding issues unsolvable in your opinion?  
I just don't get it.

I can't figure Erik out. His non-apology for backing a clearly non-consensus hardfork is damning though. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:50:48
If it was all about helping bitcoin why not listen to the actual people working on the bitcoin protocol and those working on legitimate long-term scaling solutions? Correct me if I'm wrong but I can't think of a single one who supported the 2x part of the agreement.  
In general, do you believe bitcoin core developers are competent and want bitcoin to succeed and change the world?  
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:13:21
Yeah I guess so but in my opinion in these early stages getting more and more people to help build out bitcoin infrastructure and L2 solutions (lightning) is more important than getting more people to use it.  
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:25:27
Accusations based off of evidence...  
Do you think someone can be indicted without a "shred of evidence"?

@_date: 2019-02-06 15:01:34
With one on-chain tx (opening a channel) and one more (closing the channel) you can make millions of payments. I think you overestimate how often people will be opening/closing channels. Don't need to do it very often.  
Smart people are worried more nowadays about there not being ENOUGH opening/closing of channel tx's on the layer 1...

@_date: 2019-06-26 14:01:37
Stress is the point that really flies under the radar IMO. Buying x bitcoin and being committed to holding it for at least y years allows for absolutely 0 stress if you didn't buy more than you can afford to lose.

Do you really think there aren't dummies out there going "Bitcoin? I really need to start learning about this thing. Well, maybe I'll start at bitcoin.com and go from there".  If you don't you underestimate both old people and dumb people. These two demographics are a large part of population. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:14:16
I do not get how people don't understand this.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:28:36
I really don't get it.  How can they still think this won't end in an utter, embarrassing failure?  I think people like u/evoorhees agreed to this with worthy intentions but it's obviously not what the community wants.  How can they think it will work when it's so hard to find people willing to support/debate/put $ (Adam Beck's offer) towards it publicly? There's hundreds of thousands of noobs finding out about bitcoin and (we) will undoubtably side with the brilliant developers/cryptographers who got us here - not a hotel room full of CEOs.  
Not to even mention the one developer actually working on btc1 is LAUNCHING A GODDAMN ICO.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:49:22
I don't understand how people don't get that like youtube comments and twitter - the dumbest people often speak the most and the loudest. I hate generalizing communities based on the lowest common denominator.  I and many feel like Erik's heart was in the right place and he was doing what he thought best to help bitcoin.  Most people just read reddit and don't comment.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:03:33
Why didn't you listen to everyone who told you to hold you own keys (for precisely this reason). Not your keys, not your bitcoin. Do your research next time.

No preferences on who dictates how/what Core develops?  Some folks such as Roger/Jihan/Jeff/Barry/etc seem to want the job? Should it be them and the other NYA signers? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:11:42
If you were really paying attention you would notice that a LOT of people don't give a flying fuck if the base block size is 1mb or 2mb.  However, a SHIT-TON of people really, really, really care that a group of businessmen got together and agreed to change the consensus rules of bitcoin.  
The average user realizes that bitcoin core devs understand bitcoin at a technical level more than any other group. They also likely want to see bitcoin grow and flourish just as much as any other group. It's hard for people to get behind a contentious change to the status-quo when the smartest, most knowledgeable, most trustworthy people are saying FUCK NO.  
And then peoples $ is on the line and that makes things turn nasty.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:08:19
Yea core devs like luke-jr are very clear in their support of a blocksize increase /s 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:47:53
I can only speak from personal experience.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:28:46

I agree but you may not want to call others dumb with sentences like that 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:58:53
I really want to defend Erik here because I truly thought and still think there's a good chance he might be a good guy, but even the last post in his post history is him pointedly not saying anything bad about Craig Wright / FakeSatoshi or calling him out as the obvious fraud he is.  I've yet to find someone I respect in Crypto who has not yet denounced Craig for pretending to be Satoshi. So this is another warning sign for me.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:12:59
Man its so hard not to be snarky - sorry in advance.  I barely know the first thing about code but having a thorough review before going to production seems like something you should've learned already.  
Was everyone in the NYA really comfortable with one dude launching a fork-related token running the whole show and making all the code change?

Definition of "shill" from google - an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others.

Yes that's actually precisely what got me into crypto. It is infinitely easier to get funds in and out of sportsbooks with bitcoin over fiat. No one can deny this honestly (well I'm exaggerating with "infinitely" obviously). 
In terms of use-cases I'm curious: what do you think of stories like this:    
“Paperwork for transactions is a complicated issue with banks, and Bitcoin payments will help solve that by being faster. It could also help solve payment problems in countries like Pakistan, Russia, Sudan, Yemen and Qatar, which have safe companies but are victims of sanctions being imposed against their governments.”
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:17:37
I hadn't really thought about that but agree it is likely true.  
The ability to admit things could have been done differently bodes well for Bread however imo. A lot of people still hate u/evoorhees because of his lack of remorse in championing S2X (his claims of not knowing it would result in a contentious hardfork being either naive, criminally stupid or untruthful). Whereas people like u/wences have been re-embraced because he admitted 2x was a bad idea.

2) I must (to a certain extent at least)
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:03:55
To use another example: Trump has down EXTREMELY well. He is worth billions and is the "leader of the free world". I would also classify him as a "dumbo" and an "asshole".  
I would also classify many other very successful and rich people as dummies.  I personally don't believe rich/accomplished = highly intelligent. It often does, but certainly not always.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:56:04
It really gives me a chuckle when I read on rbtc how us "core shills" are apparently getting desperate... 
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:44:48
Does betting on the outcome of sports games fall under black markets for you? It's not illegal in any way in my country? In your list of things bitcoin is currently good for I'm not sure where it falls?  
My point is not that bitcoin is equivalent to the internet. My point is that to judge a technology by what it is/can do less than ten years from inception is very naive.  
I don't buy bitcoin for what i can do with it now (although the sports-gambling convenience is nice). I buy bitcoin to speculate on what I think I will be able to do with it in the future (buy house, car, etc). We are still in extremely early stages of this new technology.

There is a reason Roger renounced his citizenship and will never step foot inside the U.S again.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:51:00
I certainly understand and respect this position. However, at the end of the day bitcoiners are going to bitcoin, and those (tacitly) supporting projects that are openly attacking bitcoin (bch is the real bitcoin) are going to have a tough time with this community.  
And by support I mean turn a bitcoin wallet into a bitcoin + alt/shit coin wallet.

So just to confirm - I should only criticize those who have accomplished less than I have? Is this the case for everything? Should I be biting my tongue on calling Donald Trump a dummy because he's accomplished 10,000x what I have?
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:00:21

Yeah maybe. He does say "complete ignorance" however and I think software development can be quite different from "cryptography". However I am by no means an expert and realistically it doesn't matter at all. He's still writing awesome, incredibly important code.

The people who go to bitcoin(dot)come are the exact ones who don't do any research. That's the problem, but also why I don't feel terribly bad for them.

I don't know how you manage with all the lies and nonsense spouted about you and Blockstream Adam. Must be frustrating but good job tuning it out and putting your heads down.  
Actually here's a question - do you think the social attacks from the altcoin world is good prep for the type of state attacks we could face in the future? (I'm assuming none of these projects have state backing which I'm actually very unsure of).

I really want to believe u/evoorhees but I work for an FI and I know how projects work.  There is very little chance the project team wasn't referring to the coins in this manner throughout. And high-level execs are kept abreast of projects like this...  
I have a hard time believing some new girl to the company who is apparently ignorant about crypto made that fucking youtube video.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:47:20
I understand. However, there are many, many people like me new to the space trying to figure out who is right / who is wrong in this blocksize debate. You should try and do a better job convincing people. Right now I side with core mostly because reading/listening to them I truly believe they want whats best for bitcoin/the world.  I trust them as individuals (and because I don't understand the technical aspects) therefore I trust them in figuring out the best ways to scale.

Hey, truly not trying to be a dick but I am interested in your thoughts on the article in my first reply to this comment. It seems to me it is inevitable we will be hearing more and more of these type of use-cases going forward.

You don't need to know people personally to understand they are an imposter/fraud...
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:54:38
Could be.  Most of my info comes from twitter however.  And there I make absolutely sure I'm following folks on both sides.  To be fair, more from the core side but still.

NEO is the centralized Chinese Ethereum equivalent right? Or is that Nano? I get many of the alts confused tbh. Honestly I wouldn't say I know enough about it to call it a shitcoin, but if it is the completely centralized one out of China then I would say so yes.

Is there a list of contact info for the CEO's of the businesses who signed segwit2x?  I feel like I should be doing something as a user and need to email them or something.  I feel like this fork is really going to fuck up my deposits/withdrawals from the (several) online sportsbooks I use regularly :( 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:15:01
I disagree strongly with his stance on 2x but calling him filth is super mean, untrue and not helpful. I have a VERY hard time believing he's trying to sabotage bitcoin. There's a lot of people in the world I would classify as filth, but Erik isn't one of them.

We shall see my friend. A lot of those same people you're describing also dismissed the internet.  
edit: also it's not an assumption. He admittedly doesn't understand cryptocurrency "at all".  
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:00:50
I don't really give a fuck about the blocksize personally.  I don't like backroom deals struck between people who are not the most knowledge about the tech (relative to core devs obviously).
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:15:21
Either that or someone's got a family member of his held hostage or something.  It's hard to imagine he could still possibly think this is going to work.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:39:55
Erik, I think you chose your words poorly. Privy means: "sharing in the knowledge of (something secret or private)".  
There is nothing secret or private in this matter. Working at a crypto company working on integration with bitcoin.com and being unaware of this strain credulity. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:45:20
As a newbie you are coming across very, very poorly in this thread just FYI (and I mean your personal comments, not those made about you).

@_date: 2017-10-13 14:51:23
I reconcile it thinking that less than 10 years ago bitcoin wasn't a thing and it is still coming into it's own.  I personally don't expect a global electronic currency to stabilize in less than a decade...

This I don't really fully get.  When it fails won't he and Garzik be viewed as the dudes who tried to highjack the development of bitcoin but failed? What's worse?
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:47:43
Respect.  Thanks for your response.  It makes also makes me really happy because I'm quite certain Core will not be working on the 2x chain and that others share your opinion and will bail on the NYA once this becomes readily apparent.
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:10:58

Gemini is based out of NY but takes Canadians and is super legit.  They make you provide a whole bunch of ID, etc.  Takes a while to get verified.

I am constantly amazed learning I am a paid shill that is part of an organized campaign against segwit2x.  Doesn't it make more sense that I'm just some random dude who got into bitcoin fairly recently and doesn't agree with something that appears unnecessary and is obviously highly contentious with the smartest dudes in the space?

Certainly.  However investing now it making a bet on where/what it will be in the future. 5 years from now when (if, I guess) the market cap is orders of magnitude bigger, do you still foresee it being quite so volatile?

I personally think he is comprised/controlled by a 3 letter agency and they are playing a long-game. No proof obviously just my gut feeling.  
With that being said I do not think it matters. Bitcoin, like the internet, has no website.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:45:01
While I do think segwit2x is effectively an attack on bitcoin (i do not believe this was the intent) I don't think dudes like u/evoorhees is an enemy of bitcoin. I think he's a guy trying to help and stuck in a bad situation. I do find it weird however he hasn't backed out (he would have many good reasons too) considering the utter improbability that 2x is going to happen successfully. Plus I don't see how you can't REALLY question Garzik at this point about his morals relating to his new alt and segwit2x

@_date: 2018-03-13 20:20:06
I actually agree with you 100%. However, I still own a small position just in case I'm (we're) wrong. I would  also add:  
3. Ability to scale long-term still very uncertain  
4. Centralized point of failure (I think Vitalik could really fuck up ethereum if he really wanted to).  
edit: weird I have 3. and 4. beside my points respectively but they're appearing as 1. and 2. Weird.

Bitter and short sighted. My mom asked me yesterday "what's bitcoin at?" I say "7k". She goes wow you must really, really believe in it. I said of course I do, nothing fundamental has changed. Plus I bought most of it at 2.1k less than a year ago...  
She then started to question me why I didn't just sell it at 20k and buy back now. Wanted to throw myself out the window.
