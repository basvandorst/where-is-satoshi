Lots of hubs are powered externally so you can plug high drain devices into them. They vary on wattage but I imagine if this device carries the official usb label(meaning it conforms to some standard iirc) then it'd be easy to find hubs for the job. Obviously, it'd be better to buy a bigger machine. The only advantage I can think of is you'd be able to slowly increase your hashrate with the money your convoluted mining rig makes.

I know that feel bro.

I'm not 100% sure how to use the bot yet. Do I post accept here or pm the bot? I actually did make a begging post [here]( and put my address on it.

Anybody that wants to do a bro a solid and help with bitcoins can look [here](

That's a good question but idk, if they haven't already, we'll have to wait till they publish specs to find out.

You're probably right. It's too bad begging is forbidden on this subreddit... Some people *cough-cough are probably in a tight spot right now and could really use the help *cough. :-)

Oh. I didn't realize it was a joke but thank you. $2.19 down, only $897.81 to go! You are now tagged as "Bro that helped me when I needed it most" and can expect up-votes from this guy for life. :D

So how did that go?

As long as you have fewer than 127 usb devices and properly powered hubs, why wouldn't it work? Pool mining uses very little bandwidth so I don't imagine it would exceed the bandwidth limit of even usb 1.1.

I really miss the Chappelle show.
