Well you can infer deviations from current price, averages and look at the price history and make accurate enough predictions. You can’t predict exactly what’s going to happen, sure, but prices tend to move in trends

Then stop electing people that support that stuff? Tax isn’t a bad thing, the way your government uses it is.

Based on the data on the graph ��‍♂️ right now it’s close to being overbought and the lower end of the band is $10k. It’s more likely that if the resistance level holds here, it could start a downtrend back down to a lower level to try again. Not saying it’ll be $10k, but if support fails it could happen over a couple of days

I remember reading it somewhere. I’ll try and find a source for you. Essentially I remember reading that it uses (or used to use) google APIs, but purposefully anonymised the requests

RSI can hold past 70 in a strong uptrend
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:06:24
Yep, these are silly gains for a short amount of time. Look at what happened in 2013 and 2017. Over the next few months the value bled away and it stabilised (at least on a weekly basis) for a long period of time. It might go higher, but too much inflation too quickly isn’t a good sign for the long term, and I’m pretty sure by the end of this year or mid next year, the value will be much lower.

If usage doesn’t pick up, demand could drop. Right now we’re trading to hold, but how many people actually use it as a day to day currency? That part is still developing, and if it doesn’t take off as well as many would like (or if a newer and better currency comes out), it could be worthless. An item is only worth what someone will pay for it.
Plus, fiat money is backed by governments that assign its value, and (I think) back it with physical gold which has a value.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:22:25
Problem is none of those are nearly as good
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:37:24
I did say that I wasn’t 100% sure on the gold part.
And referring to your second point... Who decides that it’s a store of value? Saying that “bitcoins use as a store of value gives it value” is a bit of a tautology. As I mentioned in my comment, it’s value is derived from supply and demand. If demand drops, so will its value.
This isn’t to say I’m an expert in the field, but bitcoin is not exempt from basic economics.

The comments section feels like a bloody advert wtf
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:58:29
Okay, go live in a field and see how well that all goes for you then. I should have known better than to post here for some mature discussion
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:48:37
I never said it **was** going to happen, just that it could - just like it could spike to $20k tomorrow. All you can really do is try to predict a reasonable forecast for what may happen. As you said, you can’t see the future
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:31:16
That’s exactly what they want you to think. It is entirely possible to vote the corrupt people out, you just don’t care enough for the most part (not aimed at you, just your general society)
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:00:21
That’s because it uses google under the hood

If you live in Zimbabwe, yes? Why should they house you for free whilst you use their resources? And the tax wouldn’t be half.
What you’re suggesting will just create tax loopholes for the rich, resulting in the poorer people covering the costs.
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:39:37
Tbh I can’t see this changing much. Any capital gains are taxable and bitcoin shouldn’t be any different. The regulation just hasn’t really been set in place yet but for people to treat it like a real investment, it needs to be handled as such.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:05:24
How very constructive.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:23:00
I’m not really going to argue semantics, but if you make money you pay tax, it’s as simple as that. I don’t really care _how_ it’s paid, just that it is. I see your point about inflation however
@_date: 2019-07-30 14:03:24
Vote for people you believe will do the right thing, protest against bad decisions, boycott the companies that have power. It’s not easy but it’s simply lazy to say “we can’t do anything”.
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:52:36
The value of alt coins follow the same pattern as bitcoin so they’re not even that independent
@_date: 2019-07-30 11:37:29
Because you’ve made money. If you want to invest in assets to earn a living, it doesn’t make you exempt from paying tax like the rest of the population.
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:14:21
Oh you’re one of those “taxation is theft” guys... okay, pay for your own roads, infrastructure and schools yourself.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:59:11
Yeah I agree, there isn’t really much evidence to suggest it will go down to $10k any time soon right now. Especially not a sharp decline like originally stated. There’s plenty of support levels to get past on the way down if it does go that way and it could stop at any one of them
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:55:58
Does the same not hold for most other crypto?
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:00:28
I think I was actually wrong about that, it uses Yahoo and Bing, not sure where I got google from
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:26:53
Yeah, thought I was reading at first

I think if the beer around where I live was £1.30, I'd be perma-drunk, so perhaps it's a good thing that it isn't...

This post is literally just a huge advert for BitPanda lol
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:26:57
The drop from $20k to $3k took 8 months, there’s still time
@_date: 2019-08-30 08:45:19
IMO you shouldn’t have bought all at once, spread your investment out over a period of time and you’ll get the best price
@_date: 2019-08-10 06:58:22
Could this be classed as fraud in a sense? I imagine if any trading institution lost money because of what they did, they’d be in for a bad time.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:24:36
The best way to go about it is just simply dollar cost averaging. 
The majority of people don’t know how to read the market, and even if they do there’s no way of knowing what’s going to happen. “Buying the dip” is bullshit imo.
If you’re gonna invest £10k, split it up into equal chunks (e.g. £100 a day for 100 days) so you’re never exposing your whole investment to a correction.
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:57:24
You don't have to sell it all, just cash out a bit if you need it, you can always invest more later on

@_date: 2019-10-04 10:46:45
That's not it, you are charged that much if your 30 day rolling total is less then $10k. You can consistently buy and sell and that total gets much higher and lowers the fees.
When I was trading daily I was trading $2-3m each month, but I never had anywhere near that much.
