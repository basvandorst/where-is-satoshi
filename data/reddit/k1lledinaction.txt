You get people like this is life, he must be pretty bored...
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:49:32
Would you like it to be added?
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:21:12
Yes, I agree, I'll have to look into that.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:16:38
Some things don't die, if your cab driver said you should buy bread, you still would.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:04:36
I just thought people may be interested as it supports BTC projects.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:10:24
I mean you could just put in $1 to test if you want.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:03:20
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:22:21
I invested $5 on my first time. I am literally creating a win/win here. Trying not to sound scummy tho.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:43:46
Ahah :D
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:36:43
I understand what you are saying but there is no point building a skyscraper on scraps of foundations! The nodes will always be relevant and the numbers may die down after this most recent surge in popularity.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:07:34
Basically I have a ref code that gets me 10% of what you pay to bunny token. You can then immediately withdraw. I will then split the referral bonus!
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:01:12
That’s why you can choose to use a monero miner or an anonymous monero address
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:32:01
Well, I will do my best
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:26:48
As I said, you can immediately withdraw to Bitcoin, no problem.
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:01:31
Some type of Escrow system.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:36:13
Yes, apologies.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:48:57
It was never thought that we would be able to compute 10 numbers 100 years ago! Look at us now!
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:52:13
Okay well, technically a Bitcoin payment could be anything that involves getting something for Bitcoin, therefore, Using an automated Bitcoin to Monero to Bitcoin converter you could have an anonymous Bitcoin payment.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:35:44
Will do, not that I’m planning on dying anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:27:08
Sorry, what do you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:56:01
Yeah, true, I'm mainly just providing it for people who are travelling, need instant alerts etc. I personally need it for when I'm out.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:51:17
The price has some importance, yes. But, Bitcoin was not built around its value. True believers in the currency do not mind what the value is at current, as one day fiat will not be used!
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:00:04
I have data, however, I would find it easier just to receive an alert.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:03:06
Ahah, yes I see what you mean, if you check a few posts ago, I have made a website that supports Bitcoin nodes and would allow people to receive donation without revealing their identity (nodetip.com)
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:18:34
doesn't matter guys I have found a way.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:15:21
Thanks, I'll check it out.
EDIT: It seems to be still in development.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:09:19
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:50:52
I guess it would be in my best interest.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:48:05
I understand that t is not guaranteed but what would happen in the event of bankruptcy? How would you be covered?
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:13:20
I would say that the best would be Rpi3 with a 250 GB SSD/HDD.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:49:33
Thank you for all of your replies, despite finding it hard to admit, I see that this projects is not going anywhere and will concentrate else where.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:45:31
I would eventually like to have a page for every node to tell its story and stats about it!
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:04:50
Okay, great! Won't have to make one myself!
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:42:21
Must be careful not to generalise, but, yes a large amount of people here are like that. Which community are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:58:14
Guys, I've set a reminder, I'll meet you here in 10 years.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:10:04
Yes, but straight after, you can withdraw in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:08:39
And guess who the saddo who always reads it first is.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:48:30
Hey, I have been looking into the topic of anonymity and so far, the best option might be to have a donation address that allows a user to donate Bitcoin which is then sent to a BTC to Dash converter and then back to Bitcoin. This would make it extremely anonymous.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:47:13
Well, I'm all for Bitcoin, but I feel we may run into this issue.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:29:12
I'm unaware of any fees other than the BTC fee. I am only offering this here as I can't use my own account with the ref fee and none of my family have BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:56:47
Apologies, I have a much higher percentage of bitcoin assets and feel I have to take different measures that may not be necessary to some people.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:53:42
I mean something like this is really needed. Nice to see someone taking some initiative. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:57:59
I understand what you are saying about the BTC address but not the IP as a node can be found by doing a whole net scan in under an hour, this along with its location and ISP. 
With the donations, have you got any ideas on how donations could be allowed without revealing this?
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:01:36
I was thinking of donating 90% of mine to charity. Trying to live minimal.
Also, I believe in this basket. And it’s a big basket.
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:51:50
I thought it seemed pretty legitimate. Has its own page on faucethub.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:19:51
I respect your opinion, however, I have had plenty other people show interest in this project and it will continue. This is self funded. The more you put in, the more you get back. I hope you change your mind but thanks again.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:12:47
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:53:06
I guess it depends how much you are trying to keep safe. I personally think that I would opt for a system that does not rely on a third party. Possibly self-made (bit if a programmer) in which the keys were encrypted until a certain time, which I knew I would be dead by. Happy thought :D
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:00:24
Newcastle in north east England, the original Newcastle 
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:03:52
I think this is my second post.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:45:26
Lets say there are attacks on Bitcoin in the future, with better computers than us, an attack that starts creating millions of addresses and periodically clears their funds. What would happen?
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:35:22
I feel like there’s a demand for a new sub possibly.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:32:59
I emailed the guy and he told me that the projects that were listed on his page were all ongoing and he had already contributed funds himself. He said that the page was built to support his Bitcoin related projects and that the last 25% was to fund domain and hosting costs, after that he would take for his own.
After receiving his email and using his page I am fairly certain that this is legitimate. I think he said he would be posting project updates to the page.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:39:19
Yes, this could prove to be a problem if a private key was leaked. Perhaps, a timer system that sends funds to a wallet in say 30 years.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:19:17
Well, we'll see.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:49:19
Possibly, it seems pretty legitimate though.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:47:28
Do you host a node?
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:58:54
Congratulations :D
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:34:54
Would I have to list it in my will? Would Bitfinex finally take it or would it literally just sit there?
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:56:22
I appreciate that this may not be the most valuable use of my time and I will work on other projects. I will finish this project by making it fully automated and 'hands free', add it to my portfolio and move on. Even if this is a waste of my time 'in your eyes' it is developing my skill as a programmer. Thank you for your support and I will continue this project.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:39:05
I am on 2 mb/s and actually started a scheme that will allow people on a 'third world' internet connection to host a node by sending them a HDD with the latest blockchain on it to reduce the amount they need to download! It just never really got any interest...
EDIT: Used to have another account but was hacked.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:48:54
I'm not sure, it says on the page but I'm at work.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:27:08
That would be great! Channel 4, here in the UK is £1000 for a 30 second slot. Sky One is about £500.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:09:38
tell me when its done!
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:29:57
Hey, I currently enter all IPs manually, in future I will construct a program that does this for me. I do realize that this is a large responsibility and have taken relevant precautions:
* The database is not hosted on a 'root' user.
* Antivirus software installed.
* Strict firewall.
* Multiple copies of the database.
* Hosted in a physically secure environment.
* DDoS protection 
* Fail2ban installed with custom settings.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:11:01
I have contacted Samourai regarding this.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:02:42
But they can expect it
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:30:16
Yes, but a way around this.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:41:20
I will get back to you with my results.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:17:06
Well, I am using the RPI3, I just installed a small heatsink.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:03:19
So basically, you get caught: Better call Saul.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:45:29
Are you guaranteed security? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:58:47
Thanks, I'm working on just this right now :)
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:44:15
And not all people will be as committed as you. I can see that you are a very active user and clearly have a lot of interest. I am creating this to give people the incentive to join us, then they might stay.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:20:32
Well, if you're willing to contribute, I can make that happen quite easily.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:17:59
So a better way of privately trading?
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:58:28
Your loss.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:19:08
Glad to hear this, if you need any help with setup you can view an earlier post of mine [here]( or pm me.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:03:08
Yes, I understand that it secure your own transactions, but you are also supporting other people. This means other people are using your electricity and your computer to help them perform a task (a transaction), if this was mining you would be getting paid, why not this?
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:21:58
This system does not require trust. The lottery could go to a monero address instead or if the demand was there I could create a program that encrypt the IP so that I cannot view it.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:52:38
Yes, one of mine is actually running on rpi, only problem is that I'm getting an increase in usage which is causing the pi to overheat!
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:09:27
Anything specific?
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:55:47
Reminds me of the recent Pewdiepie vid
Better not be pronouncing that jif :)
