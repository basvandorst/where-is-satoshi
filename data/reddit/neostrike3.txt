In the last 1.5 months alone it has gone from 19.9k to 14k then back to 18k then back to 13k then to 17k then to 11k then 17k again and now crashed to the lowest i saw 9.5k and now its at 12k.
So before YOU get excited that it is "rising" realize that 1. It isnt even close to any of the highs in the last 1.5 months before it crashed again and everytime it has crashed it has gone lower then the previous crash. 2. Even if it raises it can easily crash and crash worse then before, the past few weeks have been examples of this. People get all excited it is going up again and start acting all high mighty that they were right for it to crash again even worse then before. 
Im all for it going up since i own btc but its annoying to see posts talking "smack" about people who were claiming btc is dead and crashing when they do the same exact thing as the people they hate when it raises

Just like all 630k of people here dont have coinbase accounts. And even the ones that do wont all actually have 0.1 btc = ~$1600 currently in their coinbase account. 100k people had $1600 each which is roughly $160million
Its a noble gesture but to think this reddit community has that much combined is doubtful
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:56:30
I'm all for it going up but it can easily go straight back down like it did twice already in the last few weeks
So Saying it recovered already is pretty premature

I got $500 in btc  and $140 in Ltc  Trust me i been in the red for a month and right now im still about  a -40% loss. Just have to wait and hope

I have had bank of america  for 9 years and this has been a standard for years. This isnt new and idk why people are freaking out about this. $1500 is a huge limit for low income to have but $250 direct deposit monthly? Really? Thats less then a weeks pay at minimum wage. 
They also have a program for students to have free checking for 5 years which waives this fee if they dont meet the above requirements.
But i guess any reason to hit big corporations people will rally behind.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:51:30
They have 100 million accounts? . There is 630 thousand users subbed here. Saying each one had a coinbase account which we know isnt true and wanted to do this. It would only be less then 0.6% loss. You wouldn't make a dent
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:30:28
Then dont overdraft? I had a bank account with one of if not the worst bank in the US for 9 years. Bank of america. I have never had an overdraft fee since im responsible and watch what i spend and know how much is in my account/will be after things clear before i pay a bill/make a purchase.
Their overdraft fee is $35 if your account goes into the negative and is still there within 24 hrs. Also another overdraft fee of $35 if its not corrected within 5 business days. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:59:40
Where 100% americans do already that make less than 20k/yr [$10/hr]?

This. Bought at peaks at 5200, 7800, 8200, 10500. At the time i was nervous but now looking back i know it was right. Thinking now if you bought it, if you give it a week or two and it will hot 13k-14k and  you will feel the same

Just attached  my credit card and ready to insta buy  if it drops under 12k. Come on baby. I need some weak hands to sell
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:45:22
Lol people saying this but changed weekly to month as soon as it dropped past positive numbers.  Next they will be saying yearly once saying monthly isnt positive

 Ya i do the same now that i have more then 0.1 btc
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:05:10
I think long term. When BTC becomes globally accepted. Having a lot already invested puts me well off instead of trying to get into it later. If that means going without a new game or movie every month for the off chance ill be able to buy 100 of them with the same money ill take my chances
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:33:57
I bought at the ath 6 times. At 5000, 7500, 8200, 10200, 12000, 14700.. but guess what  ? If you hold and dont panic sell you come out a winner

It will be there  less then a week. I bought last at 10500. It jumped to 11000 1 hr later then crashed to 8900. I held strong and 1 week later im 2k+ over  the ath
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:32:23
Considered minimum wage  is $7.25/hr in 40% of america thats only $15k/yr x 50 yrs thats $600,000.  
Just looking at my 11 years i worked i started at $8.52/hr and currently make $14/hr. So thats about an average of $11.25/hr. Which is $23k/yr x11 years =$252,000 so i managed to live  for 11 years on 1/4 that and this is even with my bad spending problems and alcoholism.  So using my numbers i could go 44 more years with my current lifestyle putting me at age 71. Ya im fine with that

This, it seems high now but in a week, month, year it will seem cheap.  I had the same mindset when i bought in at 5k and it was the all time high. 3 months later i have tripled my investment

If i had a total worth of 1+mil i would sell instantly. Sure it will go up and i can earn more but realistically i would just be earning more money then i need. I can easily live off 1 mil for the rest of my life. Most americans only even  make 1 million in their lifetime

@_date: 2018-08-08 09:04:07
people like this "just zoom out the chart to a time that fits my point". They are annoying and just as bad as the people who circle jerk as soon as they see a 10% increase or go and say btc is dead. 
I cant wait til zooming out 1 year ago will be a mass negative so annoying people like OP cant go"it was increase from a year ago! Keep hodling guys!". Even then I know people like him will just increase their "zoom out time from 1 year to 2 years" just to try and keep their argument valid to themselves.
Exact thing that happened after the crash in January and people said "just look 6 months ago!we are still positive!" Now that cant be said they have extended it to the 1 year mark now and soon that wont be able to be said
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:10:59

I sold most of it back when it first dipped to 14k after the 19k peak. I felt bad when it bounced back up to 17k but as u saw it kept dipping lower and lower each time it have a small spike in growth. So now I'm glad I took the profits I had at the time cause seeing it now is worrisome and doubt it will ever grow back to what it once was. The hype is gone and the general public who isnt into crypto will look back at the last 6 months and see it as a reason not to invest.
I still have about 0.05 bit coin left but it's such in the negative i doubt I'll be positive again on it. I spent $800 at the time for it and now it's down to like $350 . Wish I sold all of it when I was positive but hindsight and all.
I dont plan to invest anymore until I at least see it balance out and stagnate for a while or an upwards trend.

@_date: 2017-11-27 05:11:13
Um mo you're wrong. You can purchase directly from your bank accoynt BTC and you are locked into the price even though it takes 10 days. You cant touch the BTC though til it clears but you are to get it no matter what.  I bought 0.01 BTC at 7700 2 weeks ago and even though its 9700 now i still get 0.01 for the same price
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:39

People always knock coinbases fees but i like using my bank and being able to buy the bitcoin right away at that price at the time especially this year since the  waiting 10 days has always meant i would of lost more in gains than the small 2% fee charge.  I dont day trade or plan to sell until its an amount that i can retire from so not having the bitcoin available right away doesnt bother me

@_date: 2018-11-26 08:13:54
So true. All year people been like this. Just look at the charts since jan 2018 everytime you hit a "valley" and btc starting going up again people will start to celebrate saying its rising only for the next "valley" on the chart to be lower then the last. 
People should wait more then 1 hour before they celebrate 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:34:10
Nah not badly addicted.  Just watch the price everyday multiple times and let the price swings effect my mood but financially its done nothing bad
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:46:34
"early year dip". If you call a 60% loss a "dip" sure then. Also remember hearing when btc started to go down in december everyone was spreading false hope that "the beginning of the new year it will go up because of tax returns and christmas shopping is over". Ya people like that are annoying just like the people who say btc is dead. Neither know what they are talking about and just hope the charts will reflect their ideals so they can go " i told you so"
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:00:37
Yay another topic of lets zoom out the charts even further everytime btc drops more to pretend it's not crashing. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:42:07
 Pretty much where we are now. That was a 70% drop. We are currently at a 60% drop
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:53:32
That's less of a fluctuation then now.  Be comparable be like 8k drops to 3.2k
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:25:26
People like you are annoying. When it first started dropping people like you were like "ATH was 17k a week", then " ATH was 15k 1.5 weeks ago", then " ATH was 12k 3 weeks ago" then " ATH was 10k 6 weeks ago" and now its "ATH was 8k 60 days ago". 
Soon you won't have anymore graph to zoom out on and will be like herr derr " ATH was 1k a year ago calm down guys"

Fuck that, glad I sold at 14k. Kept ~$120 from initial buy in and that has turned into $10. Wish I sold all but overall im still positive from the previous sell and no point now to sell for $10 so just waiting to see if it ever goes back up again.
