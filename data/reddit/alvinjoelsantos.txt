Approval sentiment currently sitting at about [44%]( in prediction market. Still a guess at this point, unless he has some inside information or just plain pumping.

It is apparent OP does not have a complete understanding of how ring signatures work in relation to forming a transaction.

Hopefully we can get more people interested in developing and testing joinmarket. It has great potential... The difference between [sendpayment.py]( and [tumbler.py]( might be a little convoluted and could cause confusion if directly combined in [joinmarket-qt]( To add to the confusion, there are other features in joinmarket like [yield-generator]( Having a single-purpose app may be easier to explain to new users, "keeping it simple." coinmix is not an every day wallet or an interest bearing account. It is a utility that mixes Bitcoins with CoinJoin transactions and outputs to wallets of their choice, while they control the private keys. I like the idea having a [joinmarket_core]( acting more like a framework to build applications on top of. There is an [issue]( open to try to break away non-essential code and make coinmix a separate project as much as possible in the near future and totally redesign the [balance view]( from [joinmarket-qt]( current GUI.

There would always be those who would hold out hope of Bitcoin rebounding in case of a doomsday scenario, so I do not think it would ever be completely "worthless." However, Bitcoin would take a huge hit if:
1. China decides to crack down on mining pools (e.g. AntPool, F2Pool, BW)
2. There is a well publicized hack of a major exchange (Bitstamp, xBTCe, BitMEX, GDAX)
3. There is a continued decline of full nodes to the point where there aren't enough full nodes to sustain the network

Due to Know your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering regulations. The big exchanges want to stay in business, so they try not to run a foul with the authorities by complying with such regulations. You could look into P2P trading platforms, like Bitsquare, or trade locally, check out LocalBitcoins.

Agreed, with current DNS it would be quite easy to attack. For something like this to work, I think the implementation would have to be hard coded into wallets and a feature would have to be developed to allow for the registration of domains on the bitcoin blockchain itself. However, I doubt there is a demand for such a feature. I do not see this being developed and widely adopted any time soon.

Having an easy to remember domain name that can resolve to a bitcoin address in any wallet would be a cool use case. Instead of having a long string of random numbers and letters, you could simply share your domain, "yourname.bitcoin"

Cryptocurrency is a risky business., it can go up or down in a flash. Do not invest/gamble more than you are willing to lose.

Don't think you can be "exempted" from the miner's fee. You should be able to change the fee to "low priority" in your wallet, which lowers the fee, but your transaction would take way longer to confirm, if at all.

I think the best thing for you to do is to talk to a lawyer (or a different accountant) who is familiar with cryptocurrencies and tax law.

It is definitely possible. There are projects that aim to have a decentralized blockchain DNS, like the ".bit" and ".bip" projects, but ultimately something like a ".btc" or ".bitcoin" would depend on development motivation and adoption.
