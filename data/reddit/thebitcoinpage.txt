When you hover over a link, you can see its description, if it has one. Try hovering over the bitcoin-qt to see the description of that link. You can also look at the image on the howto page for an example.
The point is to put a short description for every website.

I might insert an investment category, but I don't know all the websites and companies in the bitcoin investment field. This is the exact reason for this contest. Add content, upload it and help me make the site more useful for the visitors

Added Coinfloor. check your name at  :)
All the exchanges are handling bitcoins. There are multiple parameters for each exchanges such as currencies, virtual currencies, fees and much more. At the moment the list is minimalistic, just links to exchanges which handle bitcoins. In the future I might improve on that.
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:12:57
Thanks. Its only great if its getting updated regularly, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
@_date: 2014-09-10 07:34:33
I heard that there are no inconsistencies in the site, but i'm biased ;)
And for maintaining the site up-to-date: since this post is on the front page of I got many emails with new links. I will check them and update the site in the next couple of days. Only quality sites are entered into TheBitcoinPage.

I gathered these links exactly for new people who wants to learn about bitcoin: 
Go to the [homepage]( for more resources about bitcoin.

Hi Reddit, I am the author of the website.
The goal of the site is to create the best list of bitcoin websites, in one simple page. I was disappointed by the all the bitcoin directory sites which link to too many broken links, projects that were shut down or stores with zero products available(?!). Even the official bitcoin wiki is a mess. So I decided to create a clean, simple page only for the quality ones.
I take the quality of the content very seriously. This is why I created a simple text file in an editable format (check out the [links.txt file]( and the [howto page]( ), so that the community could suggest new sites easily. In addition, I didn't mention it in the site yet but unofficially if you find a link that does not work anymore (due to the company being closed, not accepting bitcoins anymore or any other any reason), message me or write a comment here and get 5$.
Also, I am having a 500$ contest which ends in just 3 days, on the 9th of August. The rules are very simple: The person who submits the most links and new content to the website - wins. Only new and quality links that are being approved are counted. More details [here](

coinometrics is on the site.
coinalytics is in beta - can't access it at the moment
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:41:29
Thanks for the feedback! I will add both sites on the next update. A charity category sounds good as well. If you keep updating the content using the site upload feature, please make sure include your nickname so I will be able to count your suggestions!
Links for the small icons? hmm.. maybe on the next version :)
And twitter? maybe, but there is a twitter account for almost every website on the list, so it will contain too many links

I have been doing this for the past month for my site, manually checking and adding great bitcoin websites:
Every link here is up-to-date, related to or accepting bitcoin.
Plus, I'm so certain that this list is quality that I'll give anyone 5$ for every broken link or any website on that list which was closed or no longer accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:22:09
I sent them an email and their response :


I'll remove them from TBP on the next update.
@_date: 2014-10-21 13:54:09
If you dont find what you are looking for, look at other categories for general purpose shoppping:
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:34:29
I added scroll bar to sections for display purposes, to avoid columns that are much larger than others

@_date: 2014-09-02 18:54:03
Of course. I have created the "Learn about.." categories on my site for this exact reason:
I suggest that you visit these links, which I personally picked, and choose the best one for you.
If you need other links or resources about bitcoin, check out the other categories by going to the [homepage]( (which again, are manually picked by me, each and every link).
Good luck

Added coinbrief.net to 
@_date: 2014-08-13 06:44:21
I also added so many features during this time.
For example, you can now link to specific categories... like [Bitcoin Wallets]( or [Bitcoin Exchanges](
