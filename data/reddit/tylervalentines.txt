Yes. I'm thinking index funds. I mean, I'm all for putting 15% of what you have into Bitcoin if that means $15k or so, but if you don't have much, isn't it a waste..?

Lmfaoooooo. Do you think there are hedge funds investing in crypto shit coins? Maybe ;).

They're regular people like you and I. They browse Reddit on their free time for sure. Especially cuz they're probably nerdy after years of studying they have no friends they have to go on the internet also.

Hmmmm. Idk. Is it even worth it to put such a small amount in it? I mean how much would Bitcoin have to grow to turn that into 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000?
I'm just going to put the small amount of money I do have right now in safe stuff.

I mean who does..? Everything you read on the internet probably doesn't even apply to you because everybody's circumstances are different.

So you're telling me someone literally robbed you of a sum over $100k and you're powerless to do anything about it.
This is why people should not hold so much bitcoin by themselves. It's too dangerous.

HAHA I agree. Nobody fucking knows what's going to happen. It's a SEA of SPECULATION.  Why anyone would put more than 15% of their portfolio into speculation is BEYOND ME. 
But now that OP made his mistake. I'm not going to be hard on him. 
I think that Bitcoin will survive as an asset class. But the valuation is iffy. My strategy in order to potentially savage all of this, would be to withdraw all the cash you have right now and dump it all in bitcoin. 
Idk... at this point, all of these decisions are stupid and OP is fucked.
Sorry :/
Edit: But I think the most important thing would be to pick a strategy, write it down and
stick with it no matter what. Panicking will not help.
