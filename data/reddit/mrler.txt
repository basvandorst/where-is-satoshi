If this concerns you, all you have to do to protect yourself is never reuse addresses. That way your private keys are protected by SHA2 and RIPEMD160 which are not compromised by quantum computing.

Accepting multiple payments to a single address could be an accounting issue and will obviously allow an observer to link the transactions, but the real concern is reusing an address after you've spent from it.

Namecoin is very interesting, but not meant to function as general currency.

I think one of the most import parts of the discussion was when Mr. Schiff compared the risk taken by an early investor of $50 to someone investing $1M today.
If he can't understand that to compare the risk taken by each he would need to compare similar values (investing $1M a couple years ago vs. $1M today), I don't know if he can be reasoned with at all.

I just read the whitepaper for Peercoin (didn't know much about it previously). The proof-of-stake system is interesting and more efficient than Bitcoin's proof-of-work system. I'm actually convinced that the proof-of-stake system is more secure than the proof-of-work system, but a 51% attack against Bitcoin seems highly unlikely at this point and so I doubt that Peercoin's advantages (a possible security advantage and a definite energy efficiency advantage) would be compelling enough to displace Bitcoin.
Definitely more interesting than Litecoin.

Yes. Changing the hash function used for proof of work would require some coordination, but it's very doable. If SHA2 needed to be removed from the address generation process, that would be messier (people would have to move their coins), but SHA2 is one of two hashing functions used there.

The rewards are - and should be - proportional to the risk. Early investors were making a very risky investment even if the size of the investment was small.
Lost coins really don't matter at all. A 'Bitcoin' is an arbitrary unit and the number of total coins is an arbitrary figure. When an amount of bitcoin is lost that just means the value present in the network is divided into fewer units, but since those units are as divisible as needed it doesn't matter.

They're capable -and they would probably have a massive hash rate- but they wouldn't be efficient. No general purpose computer or computer optimized for some other task can compete with a mining ASIC's efficiency.

Bitcoins exist only as entries in the blockchain 'ledger'. There is nothing that identifies a particular 'coin'.
 Transactions moving coins from one address to another are added to the ledger in 'blocks'. When a miner wants to add a block to the chain he bundles a bunch of transactions together, along with a single special transaction transferring coins from nowhere to an address he owns. This is where new coins come from.
In order for other miners to accept a new block as valid, the block must meet a certain requirement. When run through the SHA 256 hash algorithm, it must produce a number (called a hash) that is less than an agreed upon target. To achieve this, the miner adds a bit of junk data to the end of the block. This is called a 'nonce' and there is no way to know what nonce will make the block meet the target. So the miner repeatedly changes the nonce and tests it to see if the resulting hash meets the target requirement. This process is computationally expensive, but once a miner finds a nonce that will make his block valid it is easy for others to verify (finding the nonce might take billions or trillions of tries, but it only takes one hash to verify it).
Every so many blocks, everyone on the network determines a new difficulty (the number that the hash must be less than) by evaluating how quickly blocks were found during the previous period. This adjusts the difficulty so that blocks are found - on average - once every ten minutes. The number of coins the miners allow each other to transfer from the ether to themselves in each block also changes after a certain number of blocks (it's halved each time).
That's the best I can do right now, I'm on my phone, in a car. I highly recommend that anyone interested in bitcoin - particularly if they're going to write about it - read the white paper. It's not very long and it's very understandable.

If you're trying to compare the risks as they relate to the dollar of their times, and you say the dollar was safer several years ago, that would mean that it was riskier *-relative to the safer dollar-* to invest in Bitcoin several years ago than it is now *-relative to the riskier dollar*. That's the opposite of what you first said. 
And any change that in the dollar's safety or value over the past couple of years is going to be completely insignificant in comparison to the changes in Bitcoin, so it doesn't matter either way.

All of these videos seem to start with "I don't understand how it works, but here's my opinion on it's value..." Which is then followed by comparisons to beanie babies and tulip bulbs.
TL;DW - He doesn't think it qualifies as a currency because it's not widely accepted.
For something like Bitcoin - a currency created from scratch with no backing - it's kind of a chicken and egg problem. It needs to be widely accepted to be useful as a medium of exchange and it needs to be useful as a medium of exchange to be widely accepted. Fortunately, there are people who **do** understand how it works, can see it's value as a technology, and are willing to take a chance and offer goods or services in exchange for it.
Bitcoin might reach a critical mass point and enter wide use, it might not. Nobody can know for sure which it will be. As a technology, Bitcoin is powerful and potentially world changing, but that doesn't mean it's success is guaranteed.
If you're really interested in Bitcoin, spend the time to actually understand how it works. It's silly to try and compare it to beanie babies, e-gold, dollars, or stocks without understanding how it works. There's never been a currency that's instantly transferable from person to person at almost no cost, perfectly fungible, potentially infinitely divisible, that can be stored as writing on a piece of paper.

With the right parameters scrypt hashing involves a lot of memory. So a scrypt ASIC would need a large amount of memory (making it more expensive than a SHA2 ASIC) and your bottleneck is going to be memory operations. This would mean any scrypt ASIC wouldn't be much cheaper or much more efficient than a general purpose CPU.
However, litecoin's scrypt parameter's don't even require a lot of memory, so none of that matters.

Personally, I'm pretty uninterested in the deflationary vs inflationary debate. If there were consensus amongst economists as to what constituted good monetary policy and someone figured out a way to implement that policy without  compromising the properties of Bitcoin that I'm actually interested in, I'd try that alt-coin.
Building an inflationary cryptocurrency seems very doable, but I don't know if you could jump start a currency like that from zero. Plus, I'm not confident that economists could tell us how much inflation to bake in, when it should occur, or how it should happen in terms certain enough to be implemented as code.
On a different note, how would you respond to claims such as [this](
Aren't there any economists that see Bitcoin as a potentially interesting experiment? Imagine what you could do with a pseudonymous ledger of all dollar transactions.


Please ask your fellow economists to get on it. I'd love to read something like that, something that went further than offhand dismissals and came from someone who actually bothered to figure out how Bitcoin works to begin with.
