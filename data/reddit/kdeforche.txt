It's most likely that the big merchants will be the big lightning hubs as they will likely have lots of funds so they will encourage you to buy from them ?

They'll still need an additional $400,000 to manage you. And for parties.

Well, evidence may also mean scientific evidence for example, which usually does not involve accusations, crime or trial either.
Theories need evidence to be confirmed or invalidated.

That seems to be in line with what it costs them to run wikipedia.

"The currency is often linked to illegal activity online."
should that not be
"Other reporters have written that the currency was linked to illegal activity online and because that sounds intriguing and doing actual research is hard I'll just repeat it here"

What do you actually understand as crashing (hyper-inflation?) and what exactly can a central bank (e.g. the one in Belgium) do to prevent the Euro from crashing? Europe has been through an almost existential crisis w.r.t. the Euro; what exactly did the central bank do and how is the next crisis avoided?


Bitcoin is a currency/online payment platform/asset; I think no-one is suggesting that for Bitcoin to be succesful people need to put their life savings in Bitcoin.
If I have over 200K euro of savings, should I feel relax if I put that on a Belgian bank? There is only a guarantee of 100K, and you and I know equally know that if it would come to it, nobody has the money to back it. But because the Euro is protected by a central bank, there is no risk, really, is there?


Bitcoin is now in the eye of the speculator. Volatility should improve with increased market capitalization, right?


There's few people that invest (any; their life savings) money in gold, and yet, the gold price is a lot more stable.


Apparently, it's only the mainstream press that still doesn't understand that Bitcoin isn't exactly anonymous. The lack of anonymity is actually considered a major problem within Bitcoin communities, and I would think that administrations are quite happy with a public ledger.
Oddly these days you can read in the same newspapers reports of the Bitcoin-bubble and of a new world-wide financial crisis in the making (in the bank world) without connecting the dots!

I actually believe that this person really believes this to be true. Thank Satoshi that it's simply impossible since these people's fingers are itching to 'pump Bitcoin into the system'.

The research paper "Two Bitcoins at the Price of One" also suggests a simple solution to mitigate double spending attacks, which should be easy to implement in clients. So yes you're right : today it's not the case. But bitcoin is not about today, it's about tomorrow.

I'm not sure. To me, the excitement of BitCoin is not as an asset. Not at all. It's a payment system, really, that will compete head-on with PayPal. But I would be surprised if you would hear that from someone affiliated with PayPal.
Perhaps he does get it and tries to position BitCoin as not competing to PayPal?

it's ?


my books only make some sound when you turn a page but it surely isn't saying what is on the page.

Possibly because the block they mined didn't make it into the block chain (it's an orphan block)
