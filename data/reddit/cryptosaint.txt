lol this is what Tesco do (look into who owns Tesco..)
you expect a bag of frozen veg to be 1kg in the UK. It used to be. Tesco will reduce it to 900g or 850g, and charge £1 the same as other 1kg bags at other supermarkets. Or even more sometimes.
Supermarkets constantly list price per kilo in different formats. Like price per 10g or 100g, so in a hurry you can't easily do the maths to compare.
Tesco also sell inferior red grapes that are more green then red, for £4 a kilo. This inferior product in Aldi is their 'value' range and is £1.25 or £1.35 at time of writing with actual red grapes being £1.59 or £1.69.
Sometimes Tesco sell the proper product for £2 (£4 k/g) but I suppose when it suits them. If they only have inferior products they obviously feel no shame about just keeping the price the same hoping Joe bloggs doesn't have the time or energy to moan.

if I do recover them the wallet is hot right, then I'd have to make a new one?

What do you mean by fake account? you mean make a new paper wallet and test it here?
