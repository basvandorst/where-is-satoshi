No one pays 30-50% income taxes..... Anon needs to learn how marginal rates work.

0. Crypto is play money.
Retirement money is all in low cost index funds.

Bias is understandable and inevitable, just don't let it blind you! (It happens to all of us, whether we care to admit it or not).
I think mass adoption will require more than adoption by retailers. Until it's easy to purchase, transfer, use, it'll be limited to people who want to put in the time to understand it. And still, there's the reputation of being primarily for illicit goods that cryptocurrency needs to overcome.

This has little do with with US law and more to do with USAA looking for ways to up-sell different products.
Source - am USAA customer, opened a local bank account (with a different bank) a few months ago and only needed to provide ID and an initial deposit.
Edit: PR residents DO pay federal taxes. Just not income.

Have you managed to find the "dark web?" It isn't something you just google.
I've always used coinbase to convert fiat to crypto.

Seems like it finally broke resistance at $4k and is currently consolidating around $4170. To the moon?

No problem. The traditional "safe haven" during uncertain markets is bonds (US T-notes are always popular, but there are many, many more), which are not reflected in any of the market average indices, as far as I know. There are also other types of investments: REIT, commodities, etc. Also, people could just be pulling their money altogether and holding it in bank accounts.
There are many places for money to go when it leaves the traditional market so drawing a line between crypto and stocks is poor analysis. But it is an interesting hypotheses. Any way you could test it?
