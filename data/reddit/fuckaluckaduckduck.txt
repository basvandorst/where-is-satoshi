Hokay so. I'll ask some of the real questions then.
What size and type of batteries do you you use to store/transfer your solar energy to your s9's? What PSUs are you using to supply them? 
So, you have 20-25 gal water tanks with... what types of fish in them? creating nitrogen for your hydroponic greens growing under that special violet light i've heard of. 
So the greenhouse was built for growing, but you find that you have extra stored solar power and mining BTC is an easy, cost-minimal way to generate income. I like it. 
how many s9's do you think you can operate overhead of your pumps and lights?
And lastly, do you think this could work in a non desert location, perhaps a sunny part of western canada? Or do you find that you run out of stored battery power due to having machines working 24/7. 
Do you mine solo or with a group?
Do you sell the fish? or what do you do with them?

I agree. Adoption without decentralization will lead to just more of the same gov't controlled shit.

maybe Bitcoin isn't for everyone, right now. We all know it's a young tech just starting to bloom with the right imputs. Uses for Bitcoin and altcoins and the blockchain will only grow in our future. The blockchain has too many business uses not to be taken advantage of by profiteers, so uses will be developed around the population of the world that want to use it. Imo, mass public adpotion is still a decade or two away. But that doesn't mean there won't be a million large scale uses for Bitcoin, Eth, Litecoin, and most the other larger market cap coins. For a long time, there will be not a full replacement of fiat currency, but space for both. Also, the community that supports bitcoin will never let it die, there will always be nodes running somewhere in the world now. Always.

hmm. it was more of a blanket rant. the government has tried to stop or outlaw something completely and it never really works. but the situations are comparable in the way that if someone wants something bad enough, they'll get it, illegal or not.
was really just shaking my fist at the government tho :P

this. I get that he needs to fit a huge number in a graph relative to really low numbers, so it fits the internet...
But boy this log scale pisses me off.

this. or prohibition. or prostitution, or drugs. Or guns. or... wait. what have they stopped?

I agree with your decision to buy S7's instead of the new S9's, as the price to Th/s seems to be in favor of S7's. 440 usd for 4.73 Th/s vs 1800 usd for 11.85 Th/s (Bitmain.com July 3rd). The math is good there, and with 28 of them, you'd be running a system worth 132.44 Th/s off your generator, which will cost 12320 usd + 28 psu's( = 17000 usd. 
Running these things at 40000 Kwh, with a power cost of 0.01, the mining calulator I used pumped out some impressive numbers. [calculator link](
 says you'd break even day at 185.3 days, and be making 33k a year, within the set variables (and 12.5 bitcoin/block). It would be useful to know any other numbers you could provide, such as a more accurate cost of power, cost of generator, and pretty much everything Erumara said in his comment.
I would like it if anyone were to correct me on these numbers, because mining bitcoin seems outrageously profitable with this low cost of electricity. If I were to run your setup with my cost of electricity (0.11 per kw/h), I would never make a profit, ever.

why? i don't know how eth operates or plans to operate

Killer line. it made me say "Fuck yea man"
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:36:29
well. transferring our value of money from the "greenback", or gold, or w/e, into a digital currency with an emission curve would still be a large disruption in money spectrum.
outside of this, banks already do what visa and paypal do, authentiating as a 3rd party. We want to replace them with blockchain trust and cold digital storage. Oh shit it looks like im going to be ranting about this stuff for a bit.

I see what you did there.

Ok. i'd love some solid discussion on this video.
He stresses so hard that the use of blockchain is way beyond that of Bitcoin and altcoins. I would really like to focus on whats really happening right now, and how we get around some of these traps we are in. May i start with...
1. Crypto Exchanges. These are ruining one large side of decentralization and forcing a 3rd party step onto users. It is ridiculous there has to be a bank type party like poloniex w/e, where you have to send them your coins in order to trade for other coins. This ruins the openness of trading P2P.
2. The idea of bitcoin is to remove centralization. Anything that involves centralization with a blockchain is not doing it right. It defeats the purpose. Even a national coin is pointless if its value is controlled by one or few people/institutions. The point of a decentralized  blockchain is to free the market from this type of control and give it back to individuals. Everyone. "you dont trust anything but your own outcome of validation".
3. I dont think people understand what miners do and why they get paid. They do work on the blockchain, deciphering new blocks of hashes that act as a ledger of transactions of the coin. They earn coin (relative to working for stock in a company) and then get to disperse their coin as freely as they want. We already have most of the bitcoins out in the world, and they have a value attached to them, so trade is possible, and as long as there is a way to trade it freely and openly, the currency will exist. 
4. This tech is still being written. BEING WRITTEN. seriously. its like we are in the early days of computers and if you wanted to do anything, it was developed fresh. Yet the common user expects a flawless, user friendly system... urrrghhh 
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:20:42
but. but, the point is that the decentralized blockchain IS centralized without the need of your traditional centralization. Itself is the centralization, we are the decentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:30:07
ok. this is referring to how bitcoin is encrypted. when deciphering a block of Bitcoin, your computer will decode 2 lines of 256 characters, which is called 1 hash. So then, a signed hash is one that has been transacted and added to the blockchain. When we mine we try to decipher these hashes, which does work for the system, and miners are rewarded coins as compensation. Because of an algorithm that reduces the amount of coins awarded per block of hash over time, it creates a stable and predictable value over a long period of time. The problem of course is with people playing with speculation like in the stock market. just stttooopppp ittt
