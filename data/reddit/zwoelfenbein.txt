"A decentralized system is when every individual makes their own decisions" -&gt; Which is exactly what Bitcoin is. Nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin Core. There are other implementations of the Bitcoin protocol. You can also create your own implementation or create a fork. When people decide your fork is better nothing stops them from using it instead.

This isn't restricted to US charities right? So I would propose [Netzpolitik.org]( a German news site/blog that fights for things like net neutrality and privacy protection. They are an important countermeasure against the established media in Germany regarding digital rights and are for the most part funded by donations. In the past they leaked classified government documents multiple times and have been sued for treason because of that (which has been dropped furtunatly). They are defending the values that enabled the development of Bitcoin and accept Bitcoin donations.

I've seen many projects using this method. The problem is that it's veery difficult to get to know the _real_ IP address otherwise. Just think about when a proxy is used, multiple routers, vpn etc. Yeah these services are centralized but they are more reliable than any dencentralized method I can think of. As long as there are fallback addresses (obviously 1 in this case) I wouldn't consider this critical.

There is a way to create an anonymous tax system. Let's say every country publishes a Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin protocol would implement that 5% of every transaction must go to one of those addresses. The Bitcoin clients would let you choose were those 5% go to. Of course when you live in Germany you could choose the US as the receiver of your "taxes" but why would you do that? Most poeple would support their country. This way we could have a anonymous tax system based on Bitcoin.

Just create a public non-sudoer user account on each server and publish userid and password. I know this raises a few security concers, but with chroot and correct permissions this should be fairly safe. Also there shouldn't be any private information on the servers.

Yes it's evolving in a way that there are lots of variables, which are changed by small amounts at each run, like in the nature. The algorithm uses historic data from Mtgox and runs through it many times to find rules for the best moments for buying/selling to get maximum profit. My thought was that the same rules that were applied to the past could work for the present. I paused the project because I didn't have enough computation power, although I used a 32 core cpu at the end =)

First there is no such thing as "more buyers", just more transactions which means someone's buying and someone else is selling. 
The bottom graph shows the current offers. On the one side people who offer Bitcoin for as much money as possible, on the other side poeple who offer money for as much Bitcoins as possible. Everytime their offers "hit" or overlap a transaction occurs.
Predicting prices is quite impossible even for supercomputers and pseudo market analysts.

I once wrote a genetic algorithm that compares lots of Bitcoin-variables (e.g. price and difficulty amongst others) to predict price jumps and find the best moment for buying or selling.

Just a rough estimation. In the first minutes of the dump (when the price went vertical as in the picture) the whale was selling. After that I assume it was just arbitrageurs, people panic selling and bots. The volume of Bitstamp during the first minutes was about 2,000 BTC more than usual. Looking at  you could see that the price has been quickly arbitraged and fell for about 5% on ALL exchanges. As Bitstamp accounts for ~10% of the global volume and the price I just projected to the global volume. You get almost the same result for OKCoin.

You would have to install an additional Electrum server in order to do that. Since ElectrumX exists it's not that big of a deal.

Not many normal people are using it directly. But many companies are using it (exchanges/miners/pools/online wallets/..). As they are responsible for a big chunk of all transactions the update should have a rather large impact.

With Ledger/Trezor you can password protect your seed (25th word). Also can set up fake account with only small funds on it.

How does Bitstamp support Segwit? They don't use Segwit txs for BTC withdrawals (yet).
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:06:00
They handled the last hard fork quite well and let you cash out all of your Bcash shortly after the fork. I assume it will be similar when the next fork comes. If not they're using BIP39 seeds so can just import your seed into Electrum and cash it out that way.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:23:36
They have been using 3... addresses for years because they use multisig wallets. I've seen no Segwit txs from them so far.

I don't see a way to add terms in there. If you wouldn't mind please add the following terms to the German glossary: wallet, passcode, private key, phrase, recovery phrase, network fee, transaction fees, peers, password

The Mac installer is awkward. Why even use an installer instead of just providing the .app file as before?

You can if you connect an ASIC to it.

Are they UK only or EU? I'm from Germany and would like to use a UASF friendly exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:14:50
Although I support UASF the too lower quadrants that have exactly the same text/outcome but one is red and one is green seem quite fishy to me.
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:44:50
Meanwhile there are only 3 UASF enforcing Electrum servers.  
EDIT: 3 publicly visible Electrum servers with a UASF node running at the same IP.

The future market price isn't that meaningful as you have to lock in your BTC in order to sell BCC. Most people are not willing to take that risk which keeps the supply low. As soon as you can safely transfer your BCC without locking in your BTC I assume the supply will explode and the price will drop.
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:09:30
At least Bitcoin Core contains hardcoded "checkpoints" (block height and their corresponding hash) for every n blocks. That would prevent such an attack (at least up to the most recent checkpoint).

Electrum servers usually have many hundred connections because there are so few of them, so I would say so.

Safes are hard to hide and can be cracked after gaining physical access. Learning how to use a hardware wallet is not much harder than learning how to use a safe. HW wallets are superior to safes IMO.

"If we only have one signature per transaction, a spammer would need to send far more transactions and thus spend more money to take up the same transaction space."  
Why is that? As transactions fees are usually satoshis/byte wouldn't you have to pay the same amount to spam the same size?

Luke counts thin clients as well like Multibit or Breadwallet. Problem is most thin clients have no way of signaling for UASF which makes those stats flawed for checking the UASF state.

The shortage can be a result of a bubble. People realize they suddenly have 3x the money they had a few month back and feel the urge to protect it better.

You can avoid micromanagement by using Nicehash. It changes mined algorithms based on profitability and you get paid in BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:58:13
You using it makes it economically relevant (to a small extent) which is fine.

For a single exchange you can simply look at the order book. At stamp it only takes a few BTC do make the price go up/down a few dollars at the momemt.
