I wanted to make a wallet with a passcode to use in mycelium so I made one in electrum and tried to put the seed words into mycelium but it doesnt work. Do I have to change some of the settings on electrum when I make the wallet?

Most people want banks to look for suspicious activity on their accounts. Just because it might take you slightly longer to buy a monitor isn't a reason people are going to leave the security of banks.

Maybe the problem is you getting your panties in a bunch over every little price change.

Nothing is indicative of future performance if past performance doesn't qualify.
