I belive reddit implements an automatic down vote system for some reason.  Or something like that.  Every post gets downvoted to balance upvotes.   Don't quote me.

Newb question.  I set in a buy order for when a certain coin fell to a certain price.  It went through.  I have another buy order for when it drops to another price.  I also have a sell order for when that coin reaches a certain price.  But for some reason, I can't set another sell order beyond it (I'm trying to layer my sells).  Is it . cause I don't have the coin in my account because I haven't bought it yet?  I'm using binance.  I know it sounds like a stupid question and it is, and I know the answer is something simple, but I can't for the life of me figure it out.  Say I put a buy order for 12 coins at .917.  It went through.  Now I have another buy order at .91 for 12 more.  It hasn't went through yet.  Not I have a sell order at .96 for 12 coins.  But now I can't place another sell order at .97 because it won't let me.  Is that because I don't have the coins in my possession.   Please, be gentle.

Just tried to transfer from my trezor to gdax.  How long does it usually take?

We seriously need to have a bot remove these kind of posts.

I did the same.  Woke up this morning with 3.6.  I only have .4 left.  Been selling all afternoon.  My buy median was 6500 usd, so I profited a little bit.  Going to layer my buys whenever this thing stabalizes.  Congrats.

Good video.  Knowledgeable for people just getting into btc.

What bots do you use?

I feel the exact same way.  These posts about bitcoin's history doing the same exact thing every December-February is heart-warming because it's telling me that there is some evidence that it's going to come back up to where it was before all this.
On the other hand, I hear all this talk about how Bitcoin just doesn't have it anymore.  It's not the perfect coin.  There are better coins out there.  The government is finally stepping in with regulations.  It can't handle the social media spotlight now that it has become a house-hold discussion.  And this scares the absolute fuck out of me.
I was an idiot and broke the number one rule by investing more than I can afford to lose, but fortunately invested right before the huge spike of September.  Now, I'm trying to stay calm, because all I have ever heard from everyone I know who knows Bitcoin had been to no matter what, Hodl.  It's been attacked before hundreds of times.  Yeah, yeah.  I see all these people regretting during the despair phase of year XXXX.  
So I don't know what to believe.  At this point, I'm just waiting to see some form of stability.  Something.  Anything.  Even if it just stays at a somewhat price that is close to what it is now for months on in.  Instead of just falling and falling and falling.
If it drops down to where I bought in at, then I guess I will be forced to sell.  It's that psychological factor of telling myself "At least you didn't lose money".  
I hope others out there are hanging tough.  And I hope we get some kind of legit good news soon.

What app is that?

Most replies on here are saYong to go ahead and invest.  How would I go about aquiring a large amount of bitcoins?  I've only used paxful in the past.  What about years down the road I decided to sell?  How would I go about that?

I don't mind losing a couple k.  What would be a good website to aquiring bitcoin?  What about if I wanted to sell years later?
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:27:25
I have money I can spend every month easily and still be very comfortable due to my low budget.  I've bought some on paxful and just kept it.  Is that a good website?  What about if I bought a large amount and wanted to sell it years later if the price was somewhat higher?  Say $2000-$4000 worth?  Is it somewhat easy to sell that amount without major difficulties?

Oh wow.  That sounds painful and a complete turn-off.  So ideally you would want to trade from the same country as you.  Thank you for that tip!
