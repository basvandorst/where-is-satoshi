If you're deciding between company a and b you might not know which one you would prefer, and might decide to go to the one that accepts bitcoin, all other things being roughly equal. Obviously, if one business is clearly superior to another, you choose that business regardless of whether or not they accept bitcoin. But you rarely know for sure which company is better, and bitcoin is a fairly easy thing to add to your website. A very small thing, that may drive sales up a fraction of a percent. Or maybe more. It's a small risk regardless, one worth taking for a company working to set themselves apart, even in a small way.

Well, if he is or isn't Satoshi, a lot of people are assuming a lot of things when they say that he needs our help. I saw that other thread where that guy is offering to take him on a private jet to a secret island or whatever. If he's ignoring  corporations, governments, criminals, and reporters, he's going to ignore this guy too. For all he knows, the guy could be taking him to his torture chamber in an attempt to get his private keys.
I know all the people that want to help mean well, but realistically speaking unless you know the guy personally you and him are both better off without your help. 
Don't let this stop anybody, if anybody can truly help him and believes that's the right thing to do, then go right ahead.

Yes, I'm definitely following this rule. I just never realized there was such a gaping hole in the fundamental design of the system. It seems doomed to fail, any gains made will be in the short to mid-term. If bitcoin can't change, something that is more secure will have to come along eventually.

A popular bubble is the pre-2008 housing market. Prices were soaring through the roof, everybody was investing in houses, people with no credit were being given loans to buy houses. The prices kept rising and rising until all of a sudden the bubble "burst", meaning the market corrected itself (as it always does) and prices plummeted, people were underwater on their mortgages (owed more than their house was worth) and that's what pretty much caused the recent recession that we are still recovering from (and some might argue, heading back to).

If somebody can explain, why would somebody spend all that money to acquire 51% of all bitcoin, only to destroy bitcoin and make it worthless? Am I missing something?

There are fees to buy bitcoin, you are paying the exchange for the service. There is no fee to spend or accept bitcoin. Well, in the future when there are no more bitcoin to give out to miners, there will be a *miniscule* fee applied to every transactions in order to keep paying miners to verify transactions. Not 2 or 3%, a small fraction of a percent. At least that's my understanding.

I like Peter Schiff. I don't agree with his stance on Bitcoin, but that's alright. The guy still knows his shit. Read the book Crash Proof, he completely predicted the 2008 crash. Also he's one of the few champions of Austrian economics. If you like bitcoin, you should like Austrian economics.

In case its not? Or in case he lost his private keys and can't access his millions? Or just because we're trying to make a statement that we as a community stand by this man who is being harassed by the media and god knows what entities?

Hey thanks for posting this, it was a good read. Just a quick tip to save you like 3 seconds in the future, you don't have to do the full hyperlink thing in order to link to a user. You can just type exactly this: and it links directly to the user. Or type and it links directly to the subreddit. The first slash is important for this to work.

He was saying he loves the sub, seemingly because of the meme that he is responding to. I was giving him a subreddit that has only memes, I'm not trying to imply that this does not belong here.

Are you serious? Why do I even have my money in something so vulnerable? I thought I understood the risk but you're telling me we can't even properly track if somebody has the ability to carry out a 51% attack. This is starting to look riskier than it's worth.

Because it all becomes a big propaganda filled echo chamber circlejerk where people are not interested in what is right or true, they are only interested in whatever supports their bias. I'm not against people supporting or being excited about something. I just don't think dissenting opinions should be covered. They offer an opportunity for both parties to learn something, if they keep an open mind. Is bitcoin a religion or is it an investment? Any investor that can't handle reading criticism isn't an investor, they're just loyalists.

It's bad for the bitcoin community as a whole that the main bitcoin board blindly believes in bitcoin and does not allow any negative thing to be said. It makes casual observers ignorant of the realities. This is basically the_donald, bitcoin version.

Have an upvote for expressing your opposing view. I happen to disagree with it, but you have every right in the world to contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way. 
You've made your points, people have argued it, and you've argued back. Until Apple allows Coinbase, people have every right to be annoyed with them. The same reasons expressed here is the same reason why I've always had Androids. I tried iPhone, I couldn't stand the restrictions, so I switched to Android. Plain and simple. People are talking about it now because the restrictions affect something they are passionate about. 
Just because my opinion differs from yours, doesn't mean you're getting attacked by a bunch of mindless circlejerk zombies. It seems to me like you realized that there might be something to our argument, and instead of acknowledging the point you've fallen into a defensive mode. Oh well.

Never tip when the tip is included (unless the service is particularly exceptional). I also never tip when I have to pay upfront (most casual dining restaurants, burger places, taco places, etc.). If they are bringing out the food to me, I might leave 1 or 2 dollars.
I think having an upbeat attitude and being nice to people is a requisite of any type of customer service job, regardless of tipping. Even when you're having a shitty day, you have to put a smile on for the customer. There can be an element of phoniness regardless of whether tipping is involved. 
This point is certainly debatable, but if the employer had to pay the staff more, I would assume that prices would go up. At least with tipping, you have the choice of rewarding good service and punishing bad service, without having to go to the manager and make a scene (an option most people don't consider unless the situation is extreme).

This is probably the most ridiculous post I've ever read. Do whatever you want man, nobody is holding a gun to your head asking you to call your congressman.
Calling may or may not be very effective, but it certainly never killed anyone. You act as if calling them would somehow be detrimental to your life. Do you lose a bet every time a congressman gets a phone call or something? It doesn't make any sense that you're this passionate about it.

I'm on the 10% plan. Every time the price doubles, I sell 10% of my bitcoins. I make my initial investment back by the time it doubles 3 times. It's all profit from there.

I don't have an iPhone, so I've never run into this problem and absolutely cannot speak from experience. However, I'm assuming that if there's people that are bitching about it and switching devices because of it, then unless they're complete trolls they have found it detrimental or inconvenient in some way. 
The only experience I can speak from is the short amount of time that I had with an iPhone and found it very frustrating to use the way I wanted to use it.

Well that's literally the whole point, isn't it? People are switching to Android because they want that feature. They can't get that feature on Apple products. Whether or not they are "anti-bitcoin" doesn't matter in the slightest.
