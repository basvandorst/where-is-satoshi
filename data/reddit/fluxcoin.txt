It leads all the way back to this address:

Absolutely correct. Thanks for saving me from having to make the same point.
The question is, what is the base of the logarithm for each sensory datum? Nevertheless, they are all logarithmic.

No, you seem quite intent on trashing BFL, for whatever reason. I'm guessing you aren't a BFL customer, but someone enjoying the ride on the auto-fuck hate machine all the same, or am I "missing" something?
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:33:54
Don't sweat it. He just went full retard.

Saying that success isn't good news is something of a contradiction in terms.
No, this is not a sign of success. We haven't succeeded yet.
Is it a sign of impending success? I wouldn't go that far either.
@_date: 2013-08-02 19:17:45
They accept it through coinbase but not directly? Heh.
@_date: 2013-07-10 19:54:14
Wow, that's a whole hell of a lot worse than what BFL did regarding their "all sales are final" policy. They actually have had venture capital to fund their projects when they were new - nothing sleazy there.
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:36:55
You must be new here.

Of all the bad investment decisions you could have made, you probably made the worst one. Did you even consider costs-to-benefits in your investment scheme? Did you consider hashrate, power consumption/cost, rise in network difficulty, etc? Did you use a calculator at the very least, like  ? Oh well. Live and learn, I guess.

All news outlets are dedicated to writing negative articles about anyone. I never trust journalism in this day and age. Or any age.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:13:24
Interesting how some people "miss" what they prefer not to notice....
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:59:52
You know, you could try giving us some hard evidence to go on instead of lighting a torch and waving a pitchfork. I know that BFL has recently setup an RMA form that allows you to apply for an RMA, so it won't be lost in their email. That means you can give us a screen shot of your RMA application in your account dashboard to see if your RMA was actually processed yet.
No 2 of spades. Go fish.

Hey, I'm not obligated to know your life-story. I was upfront about what I thought about you. It wasn't an accusation - it was an honest question.
Don't let all that anger burn you up.
@_date: 2013-07-10 19:48:12
I like your use of "would have been". In the past compared to now, sure - hindsight is Superman X-ray vision, I know. But it isn't "all in the numbers". It's a bandwagon on the Oregon trail, and we know how that ends.

Yes, current crypto solutions are for short-term security. When quantum cryptography goes live, that will have to be the basic level of security, since classical cryptographic solutions can be handled more quickly using quantum solutions. RSA is useless, for example, as a long-term cryptographic solution.

Just the other day I heard someone complain about not being able to get BTC quickly and easily. Surely they'll beg to differ now.
Just jizzed in my pants.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:51:33
So much anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering. Do you really want to be "justified" on the dark side?
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:03:19
Quite right! :)
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:34:48
The coinish calculator is probably the best one out there. I like it. I mentioned it in an older reddit post and received a downvote. Only Satoshi knows why.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:40:44
BFL sells chips with 65nm process - and those are separate from their typical products. If anything, they encourage that approach, if a daring miner so chooses.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:28:11
Pst: troll is trolling.
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:08:45
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:13:36
Yes. This is clearly so poorly written, it's beyond retarded.
@_date: 2013-07-09 22:05:08
Excuse me while I don my tinfoil hat: That is clearly a misleading image; the boxes were full of baby innards and snuff films.
Do I win?

All AM shareholders want others to jump on the bandwagon. He just told us what cards he's probably holding. Nothing surprising there.

KnCMiner pretty much just fucked themselves into oblivion.
Too bad to anyone who thinks they're not vaporware.
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:21:08
Ah, the subtle wiles of redditors... +1
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:47:56
Well, pretty much ever since they got BTC from BDF, I think they're going to keep accepting them.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:32:40
Since when is a company shipping product "not really shipping"?
O wait. Hurr durr. I iz on reddit.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:02:22
Wait, you don't actually know it's a scam, but just like to call it one anyway?
The FUD train goes choo-choo.

I think you would be better served by looking at a BTC calculator, like  or  BTC101 stuff here.
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:38:26
Yes, this is exactly the sort of attention Bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:37:22
It has always baffled me why BTC miners would spend the thing they are supposedly using to invest... I mean, seriously, why do it if you are planning on investing in it, meaning expecting some ROI?
Then again, I suppose that can be attributed to the short-sighted expectations. Only those who were in the know when the exchange rate skyrocketed to over $250 benefited in that scenario.
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:48:52
Not a very well-written article. I hope the second one is a *bit* of an improvement....
@_date: 2013-08-05 20:30:05
You do realize we'll still be able to figure out your username on wikipedia if we check the revision history, right?
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:18:51
This trollish anti-shill sh-reaks of sour grapes. Guess we can't expect much else in this subreddit any time soon.
