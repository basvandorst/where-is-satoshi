@_date: 2016-04-15 10:17:14


No. Unless Bitcoin itself is modified, new bitcoins will continually be generated until we reach 21,000,000 BTC. Losing coins has no effect on the total number of BTC, only the amount in circulation. You cannot "destroy" BTC, you can only render it unspendable (like by sending it to an address that can never re-transmit it). Even losing your private key does NOT count as burning them because they are completely spendable as normal bitcoins are: by anyone who has (or eventually discovers) the correct private key.

So now I can give you credit not only for being inclusive but for being able to laugh at yourself. I guess you're not *all* bad.


Nope. That one's easy to work out. You say something stupid to embarrass yourself and I continue to mock you as long as it amuses me. If you actually consider yourself a troll then I'll count that as further laughs provided.

Instead of finding some random comment I might have deleted once upon a time and trying to fake that (despite the fact that I already let you in on the "secret" that anyone can easily check deleted comments) you reply to a comment that hasn't been deleted (or even edited) and try to pretend it was deleted?

The museum blamed the problem on flaws in the ticketing system used worldwide. As it turns out, this was a known problem with the ticketing system and all other museums had been confirming any refunds given instead of just taking the customer at their word.

Yes but it evens out. You need more blocks but they come in more quickly.
Orphaned blocks will happen anyways, it is just the nature of Bitcoin. I believe somewhere around a 1 minute block time allows for quicker blocks without worrying about orphans getting out of control. When Worldcoin first launched with a 30 second blocktime, they had that issue. I think somewhere around 45 might be where it becomes or stops become a problem and at 1 minute you're fine. Sure you will have more orphans than with a 10 minute blocktime but you just wait for more confirmations (although stastically the same amount of actual time [not blocks] you'd normally wait).
That said, bitcoin doesn't NEED 1 minute blocks - I believe Satoshi did not intend for Bitcoin itself to be a solo ecosystem that did everything but expected that services for specific purposes would be developed around the blockchain to compliment it based on the differing needs of the Bitcoin community.

It was also extremely dirty pool for Karpeles to come out and falsely blame Gox's failure on Bitcoin, whether he was purposely lying or just making shit up without actually determining what the problem was.
Although based on the circumstances it seems not improbable that he did this intentionally to try and crash the price (knowing it would almost surely have at least some downward price effect) in the hopes that he could then buy back some/all of the coins he mismanaged to try and have the Bitcoin community cover a loss that his company/shitty software was responsible for.

Although since this is probably the only time I'll ever hear about this company it could very well be a publicity stunt.

Presumably Roger was satisfied that they had signed the contract or I doubt he would have given them any access to the domain.
If Roger is trying to be dishonest and present a different contract from the one actually signed (signed by him and someone else who isn't actually an OKCoin employee) shouldn't OKCoin be able to provide a copy of the actual contract that doesn't have timestamp/signature issues?

That's just one reason Bitcoin is better than centralized coins like Ripple. If you were talking about Ripple, yes you'd be SOL. However if BitPay decided to make their service too restrictive and difficult to use their customers would just go elsewhere.

It's still very clear you're either a troll, a moron, or more likely both. I only feed you because it amuses me.
It's quite obvious. I said something about a remote chance of a successful legal action against a shit exchange, you show up clearly not getting what "remote chance" means and say "you'll never get anything from them, limited liability!!" and clearly fail to understand things like negligence/duty of care or the way the world actually works. If you want to believe you can do whatever you want and have almost no liability, please please please go out and do something retarded. I look forward to reading the court transcript where you try to say "BUT MY WEBPAGE SAYS I LIMIT MY OWN LIABILITY SO YOU CAN'T SUE ME!!".


so you're saying negligence is par for the course? Jesus, let me know if you're involved in any Bitcoin companies so I can avoid them!!


This made me laugh even harder the second time you said it.

First of all, reread my post. I said "might have a chance".
Secondly, that's not how the law works. There are just some things you can't agree to or opt out of, and quite often just because you think someone agreed to something doesn't mean they did or that it will hold up in court. 
Otherwise the only people successfully sued for negligence would be those people "negligent" in not saying OH IM LIMITING MY LIABILITY HERE SO YOU CAN'T SUE!
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:57:41
So would that not mitigate against any sort of large block attack? The larger the attacker attempts to make a block, the less likely they will successfully have their block included in the chain even if it is found first. Even if they pay a very large fee to trick miners into including their "attack blocks" the mining power will just be mostly wasted making blocks that have a far lower likelihood of being included?

You seem to believe that companies can escape any real/significant liability simply by posting a disclaimer "HEY WE DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING". If that worked, no company ever would get sued for negligence. (You should look that up too, since you undoubtedly haven't heard of it).

A hard fork is one in which blocks that are valid in a newer version are invalid in older versions. This is is what happened here, albeit unintentionally. New versions had no problem, older versions broke off into a side chain but for the sake of the network the invalid side chain was selected to be the "real" one as it would be easier to downgrade a few big pools than to get most people to upgrade.
Contrast this with a soft fork in which blocks that were previously valid are made invalid.
If it was a venn diagram a hardfork would be a big circle surrounding the current chain and a soft fork would be a smaller circle drawn within the current chain
at least that's how I understand it.

The fact that you keep referring to a corporation's "limited liability" status as if it is some contract proves you don't know your ass from your face.
Instead of being a smug moron, if you'd read the link I provided you'd have actually understood what a limited liability company is. 
You don't enforce limited liability - it's a shield not a sword and it doesn't protect a company from liability arising from negligence.
Just because you can't wrap your head around a simple concept doesn't make it untrue, it makes you a fucking doofus.

Roger clearly provided a service to these guys. Even worse (for them), they did make some payments to him. Regardless of the petty details, there is an obvious business relationship here and a court in any legitimate country with the rule of law would likely find a contract existed even if the written one did not conform to standards.

I'm not aware of any decentralized forum software at the moment so in order to have any sort of Bitcoin discussion forum it will necessarily be centralized and under the control of some person or group of people. At any point they could abandon the forum or abuse it for their own purposes to the detriment of the community, etc. 
Seems kind of antithetical for Bitcoin since decentralization is one of its core concepts.
Obviously the forum data (posts, replies, etc.) needs to be stored somewhere and the Bitcoin blockchain certainly has potential, although storing additional data in the blockchain is quite a divisive issue in the community [see, for example, OP_RETURN]( Perhaps this could be accomplished through some service like [counterparty]( 
There have also been proposals for side chains which are separate from the main Bitcoin blockchain but have a two-way link to it. The idea is that this keeps the blockchain from being too bloaty or congested. 
[You can already write messages and such into the blockchain]( but that is far from being workable forum software.
I don't claim to have a design for this or anything, I just expect that it is an idea that someone will propose or design sooner or later.

So when you said that no exchange has any liability, what you *meant* was "exchanges don't have any liability.... **except for cases in which they have liability**" which is obviously a moronic statement to make.. so dumb that even you were capable of understanding its stupidity and is likely why you avoided actually clarifying the issue until I was forced to put the question to you.

Lazy and or ignorant software design and coding.
Despite being a well known "issue" (not a bug) for over a year before the incident, Gox's code simply didn't bother to operate in compliance with the transaction malleability issue. If it were really a bitcoin flaw then the person(s) responsible would surely have started liquidating coins from other exchanges at least by now. 
So it wouldn't surprise me if they also didn't think about the fact that when someone gives you a private key they don't renounce their own ability to use it and so just thought "ok we have a key for an address with 5 BTC, we'll credit this guy's account 5 BTC".

That unfairness, though, does not excuse everything Ulbricht did which seems to be point of the article linked to by OP.

The "consensus" you speak about doesn't exist and won't until a majority of the network is running an updated version of the software that allows for the block expansion.
If less than the majority of the network is running that code come March 2016 (or whatever date/block height/etc. condition is set) then the change has been rejected and everyone mining 20mb blocks will split off on to their own useless fork of Bitcoin while the actual network continues unabated.

OKCoin is a private company (or just a brand if you believe what they say). If they didn't dismiss him properly as I already stated and wanted to recover any money paid they would have to sue him civilly. However the fact that they claim they knew he was incompetent the moment he showed up yet continued to pay him anyways would likely make that pretty difficult.

Fraud is a criminal issue, this is employment.

While the sensible thing to do would be not credit someone's account until you *can* sweep their address, the fact that their handling of the transaction malleability issue already shows their software is likely cobbled together out of shitty pieces of code, and certainly without a complete understanding of how Bitcoin actually works means this is totally possible.
In fact while technically different, this proposed attack is effectively very similar to the TM issue. You basically tell their software to give your account credit for bitcoins they think they control but you have retained/taken control of.

Did we ever find out what was up with that apparently fake lawyer tactic? I don't see anything by way of explanation here for that. 
If I was Chinese I might also be insulted by how it appears that they try to play the "me Chinese, me English no good" game whenever it is convenient for them despite having no problems normally communicating in English (and they signed an English contract). 
Then they go back and forth from "oh we are so poor, you are mr bitcoin jesus!!" to "we are busy we have much business this is a trivial matter". Well, which is it? 
Not to mention how hilarious it is that they say "there is no such thing as OKCoin, it is just a brand but has no actual corporate existence" yet they turn around and say "business as usual, please do not worry customers, keep sending us your money". So if OKCoin is not a legal entity, is this company being run out of Star's mother's garage? If it is just a numbered corporation carrying on business as OKCoin that's even worse. "Yes we signed a deal with you but since you spelled our name wrong we feel entitled not to pay you for the domain which you have provided to us to use for months".
The funniest part to me is that either they are really stupid and think whole fiasco will reflect well on them and poorly on Roger or that we are all really stupid enough to ignore all the evidence in favour of one statement saying "don't worry, business as usual". Really, OKCoin?

If he is ignoring a court order (such as an order to pay a monetary fine) that is most certainly contempt of court. Courts do not like people scoffing at their authority. If people could get away with just ignoring judgments, then the courts would become effectively useless since the losing party would never follow through knowing there were no consequences. 
What sort of punishment he would face in Brazil I can't say but if he is hiding assets to frustrate a judgment I am pretty sure a Brazilian judge would not take kindly to this.

If the USPTO is not doing their due diligence and awarding patents where there is obvious prior art, why do you assume they would find a letter they sent to one patent applicant (very likely by a different patent examiner) months/years prior?
If you're thinking that coinbase could just submit that letter to fight against any future patent application would that really be significantly different from them just submitting the prior art that they used to get that letter in the first place?
Perhaps having a patent that is public vs a letter that nobody else knows about would do something to discourage patent trolls (who can easily search the patent database vs spending money to search out prior art). There might also be legally strategic reasons for getting the patent in that it might cost less to fight someone in court who was granted a patent that is clearly a copy of an already existing patent rather than trying to fight their sole patent with prior art.
Those are just my guesses though. I've never applied for a patent let alone been involved in a lawsuit revolving around one.

That number is based off of the assumption that "mega miners" will as of now cease adding any further power to the network which, as long as mining remains at all profitable is probably highly unlikely.


Again, these people would also have to be willing to pay at least 8x the cost for the same mining power which also seems unlikely on a massive scale. If those chips were to be put into cell phones as you mentioned earlier, people would have to be willing to pay that premium on top of what the phone would otherwise cost. Not to mention that I don't think cell phones are a reasonable use-case since those chips would be a constant drain on the phone's battery and as it is people are constantly searching for ways to *improve* thier battery life.
So like I said much earlier it is entirely possible that a massive amount of people with small mining power *could* outweigh the "massive miners" but at this point in time (and until something else changes) I do not think that is likely.

[I said as much two days ago in another thread about 21.](
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:44:47
Don't forget that the device, by 21's own claims, might only do 50 gh/s. If that's the case, you'd need 2.5x more chips to get the same figures I mentioned earlier, which would bring the number up from ~3.4 million to 8.5 million - a substantial increase.
That also assumes that "the mega miners" (which I take to mean anyone operating commercial miners as opposed to these smaller devices for which mining is supposedly more incidental) completely stop adding power (which, as long as it remains even slightly profitable is probably unlikely). 
You also have to remember the vast price difference between these machines. The recently released S7 costs $1,823 USD for 4.86 th/s vs the 21 machine which costs $400 USD for, *at best*, 0.125 th/s. That prices the S7 at ~$375 USD per terahash vs the 21 machine at $3,200 USD per terahash. 
So you'd need to find millions of people willing to pay at least ~8.5 times the price (if not more) for the purpose of mining (ignoring any other benefits each machine might have) and have "the mega miners" add no more hashing power for that to occur.
Is it possible? Definitely. Is it likely? I'm not convinced.

Supposedly those devices do, at *best*, [125 gh/s.]( That's 0.125 th/s. 
10,000 of those would be 1,250 th/s or 1.25 ph/s.
I think the current network hash rate is around 428 ph/s.
To get to 428 ph/s (and "begin to overtake") the big miners you'd need about 342.4 times as many of those machines which would bring the total from 10,000 to around 3,424,000 (and that's if "the big miners" never add another hash of power).
So unless I screwed up my math (totally possible) you'd need WAYYYY more than "a few thousand people" to buy these machines before you'd be looking to "beat out the mega-miners".
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:08:27


And as I said I don't see dedicated miners ceasing to add hash power to the network so even if those devices were ubiquitous their hash power wouldn't necessarily threaten dedicated mining which I expect will continue to grow as 21 inc does/might.

According to [this paper]( 20% is about the maximum you could go without the attack being detectable by the pool operator as the standard deviation is estimated to be ~24%. So at 20% the block withholding can be attributed to variance and can not be said with certainty to be an attack.

It should be swept immediately, presuming the reason they are tearing the piper printout in half is because it printed out the private key along with the public one. 
I would imagine that any criminal with even half a brain would snap a picture of that receipt before taking it to the counter, pay, walk out of the store and then sweep the coins back to their own wallet.
Once someone has access to your private key even for just a second you have to consider it compromised.
I would think a better solution would be to modify the printer to only print out the address without the private key, either from a list of pub keys the shop keeper keeps updated (and has the priv keys to) or to generate them on the fly and send the address to the printer and the priv key to the shopkeeper's secure server.

It is possible that this is a move to stop patent trolls. 
Sure, prior art exists and patents should not be granted but I understand that the USPTO is infamous for granting patents that blatantly should not be granted.
So if some malicious entity came along and got these patents it could club people to financial death with them especially if the victim cannot afford prolonged litigation or to have the patent reexamined.
If coinbase gets the patents first (assuming they are granted) it *could* give free licences to everyone to use the patents in a somewhat similar way to what Elon Musk did with Tesla's IP.
I can't speak to coinbase's motivations and they could be entirely malicious and motivated by greed but I thought I'd throw this out there since it seems most other people are already calling for their heads.

That's exactly the business model of insurance companies.
1. Draft a contract that *appears* to offer coverage/peace of mind and charge/collect exorbitant rates for it.
2. Deny coverage against any and all claims and use the loopholes in the contract you snuck by the patsy/client to avoid paying out the money you took from them.
3. Profit.

It's one thing to charge a fee for your service (which was fine a year ago).

I think it depends on your market outlook - whether you expect a price increase in the short term or not. [I give an example of what I mean in this post](


On the face of it, that is true but given the current climate (significant price drop a long time ago that has not yet recovered plus difficulty that continues to generally increase) I suspect there are many people who are mining at the edge of profitability or perhaps even a loss and a massive addition of hardware like that could drive a number of people out of the mining game entirely which could (at least for a while) cause a significant drop in difficulty which would restore (at least temporarily) that profitability.
Also if the price does have a significant increase their mining profitability could go through the roof and they would be positioned to capitalize on it while everyone else who wasn't ready for the price increase is suddenly rushing to try and order miners and find space.

Which is irrelevant to my speculation as to their motivation for applying for the patents.
Sure they applied for the patents as a protection against patent trolls. Is it possible that in 5 years they'll turn evil and start trying to club other Bitcoin companies with them? Sure. 
But you'd still be 100% wrong in saying their future change of plans in any way invalidated the fact that their motivations for applying for the patents was defensive.


Wrong again.
I never said "this is what coinbase is doing", I said "before everyone shits down their throat I'm going to point out that it's entirely possible their motivation in applying for the patents was to head off patent trolls".

Well first crack just means they are probably making more profit than the guys down the line. That said, "centralization of mining" doesn't (and doesn't need to) take into account any given miner's profitability. I would expect that there will always be at least slight differences in the profitability between all miners because it is highly unlikely that they are all exactly the same.


Assuming they are a rational business, the fact that they are doing it means it is in their best interest financially. Could be a number of different reasons for example perhaps they want cash up front for further R&amp;D (and selling the miner will net them more cash than running it for a short period of time), or perhaps their manufacturing capability exceeds their hosting capacity.

True, lots of people here are quick to jump on anything that they can even remotely attribute maliciousness to (like the coinbase patent applications - most people were essentially saying "FUCK YOU COINBASE" without any statement by them and even though their patent applications could innocently be explained away.
In this case, however, this news was immediately preceded by news that at least two of their top level executives have such horrible security practices they sent millions to a scammer who had but to ask and bitpay's metaphorical "FUCK YOU" to its customers by laying out both new fees (not free) and transaction limits (not unlimited) only a year after promising "Free, Unlimited, Forever". 
So in this case people's anger is at least slightly more rational/understandable.

No it is not. You continue to make the same huge mistake the media et al. did over a year ago when MtGox went tits up. Bitcoin is far bigger than any one company. There are other payment processors and if Bitpay went under the void they leave would be filled.
Regardless of whether it was malicious or not, they handle a significant amount of money for customers. The fact that their security practices are so terrible they would just transfer millions of dollars away based on a simple email requesting that they do so should *definitely* be of concern to anyone who puts their money through bitpay. 
Are you saying you wouldn't be concerned about storing your money in a bank that would just hand it out to anyone who walked up to a teller and said "can I get some money from PastaArt's account"?
Plus I was not attacking them when this happened, I am pointing it out now that they have shown malice in saying "Free Forever" in order to entice people to spend money to set up their business through BitPay only to have them turn around and say "Yeah, we lied. So pay us or pay more money to switch your business to another service". Or do you not have concerns with that business practice either?
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:53:09
It is possible that this is a move to stop patent trolls. 
Sure, prior art exists and patents should not be granted but I understand that the USPTO is infamous for granting patents that blatantly should not be granted.
So if some malicious entity came along and got these patents it could club people to financial death with them especially if the victim cannot afford prolonged litigation or to have the patent reexamined.
If coinbase gets the patents first (assuming they are granted) it *could* give free licences to everyone to use the patents in a somewhat similar way to what Elon Musk did with Tesla's IP.
I can't speak to coinbase's motivations and they could be entirely malicious and motivated by greed but I thought I'd throw this out there since it seems most other people are already calling for their heads.

I'm no KNC insider so this is all based on what I have read so I can't guarantee it is factually accurate but if anyone has any evidence to support or refute it, please provide it!
I'm going to describe it as a sort of "reputation ponzi scheme". 
Yes, early on they cultivated a reputation for under-promising and over-delivering. They then leveraged that reputation to take a lot more money out of customers who believed they were dealing with a reputable company.
Then suddenly all of the good things they supposedly did disappeared. They went well past their deadlines for delivering the Neptunes. They then tried to reduce their liability by having Neptune customers take delivery of Jupiters instead implying by omission that they would receive NEW jupiters instead of the NEW Neptunes they ordered. 
Instead, customers got a bunch of well-used shitty Jupiters many of which were DOA. Those who didn't take that bait were promised bonus Neptunes in order not to ask for refunds.
They took all the customer money and instead of using it to provide the Neptunes people purchased in a timely manner they used it to build their own data centre to compete with their own customers. Even worse, instead of shipping out the Neptunes late, they first filled their own data centre with miners paid for by their customers and THEN once it was way too late and they'd mined a bunch of BTC and upped the difficulty, they shipped out the Neptunes. 
They're also apparently terribly designed and pull power through connectors in an amount much higher than they are rated for which supposedly caused a number of them to catch fire or burn out. 
So in the end they took an interest-free loan from their customers and used it to screw their customers even further, only providing what the customers paid for after they became relatively worthless (vs what they were supposed to be when they were purchased). 
I think the funniest part is they turned around and said "we're not going to sell to customers in the future" implying that it was their own decision not to sell to the public anymore when in reality the fact that they took their reputation and used it to screw their customers meant nobody with any sense would ever be buying from them in the future so they couldn't sell miners even if they wanted to.
Or perhaps I totally misunderstood what happened.

It is important to note that the primary change is a change of *venue* for miners, not necessarily a centralization of all mining power under a very small number of owners.
Sure you see large mining farms owned by KNC etc. but there are also a large number of hosting providers who take advantage of the geography/power cost/etc. you mention which means the same people who bought miners yesterday can still buy miners tomorrow - the only difference is they will have them hosted by someone else instead of running them from their home.

I wouldn't say that's another view. It looks like you're essentially saying what I'm saying. 
The two models are basically either:
- pay for the service with money outright or 
- sell them some data I don't care about in exchange for site access. Yes, they in turn sell "me" to an advertiser - obviously the advertiser wants to know there is traffic to the site to see their ads. My point is that since I am conditioned to ignore ads, those advertisers are the ones paying for my use of the service but they get no benefit since I ignore the ads.
or am I misunderstanding your view?

Which was in response to his comment about being sued over the patent. Yes, the patent application might not be granted. But if it is, then they can beat you over the head with it and one way or another it's going to cost you money either to defend the lawsuit or to try and have the patent re-examined and invalidated. 
You say that "the way patents work makes them invalid" as if, assuming the patent is granted - which is the situation we are talking about - the patent will magically disappear so there's nothing to worry about.

The *real* question is what is the highest percentage of that $100 someone will pay as a tx fee to ensure that *their* address sweep transaction is the first one processed by miners?

A post from someone today who can't withdraw their BTC from Craptsy is only *slightly* more surprising than a post from someone today who can't withdraw their BTC from MtGox would be.

Let's see, Texas does not have super cheap industrial power but it does have a lot of ambient heat, both of which make it  unattractive for mini... WAIT DID YOU SAY FREE POWER FOR ONLY A FRACTION OF EACH DAY? WHERE DO I SIGN UP??

It's not dangerous or complicated, all you're basically doing is rebroadcasting the transaction (or another one using the same inputs). 
Double spending is not allowed so the idea is that your second transaction will hopefully be accepted (since for whatever reason your original one seems to have been ignored) and as soon as your second transaction ends up in a block the first one necessarily expires and becomes invalid (since it would be a double spend of the same inputs that were just put in a block).

If you want to put back doors in encryption, you want to ban encryption.
Encryption with a back door completely defeats the point. Even if you installed a back door and shot the guy who put it in so nobody knew how to use it, the back door would still exist and it would eventually be found and exploited and in that case encryption would be worse than no encryption since people would be proceeding under the assumption that things were encrypted when in fact they were not at all. 
The only question is how much time would it take before that back door is discovered?

What a joke.
So the message here appears to be "Don't start an online drug market, that's too risky. Instead, have some patsy start that market and just steal all the profits from him. Way less risky."

Why *wouldn't* there be one? Because it already concluded?
Or because the US Government got tired of pursuing easy, slam-dunk cases of securities fraud vis-a-vis Bitcoin companies?

What clients do these "servers" accept and fulfill requests from? You do realize when someone "queries" the blockchain they aren't sending requests to miners, right?
If anything, most miners are clients who make requests to pool servers for info.

Certainly his sentence should be far less than DPR's.
After all, we should be holding law enforcement officers who abuse their position of trust to a far lower standard than we hold criminals to, right?

Who in their right mind would claim responsibility for creating that bug-filled shitbox on their resume?
"Hey I created/maintained a bloated bug-filled shitbox and now that the company running it is under SEC investigation I'm looking to write crap code for a different company. Hire me.... p-p-p-puhlease?"

If you ever send coins purchased through circle to "a third party" you've acted as an intermediary. The only way you don't breach that term is if you never send those Bitcoins to anyone else.
So according to Circle, their service is useless unless you intend to buy and hold forever.. (literally forever, not "a really long time").

So if you're a criminal you'll go to jail forever but if you're a cop who tries to fully leverage all the criminality of that guy and steal his loot you'll get a relative slap on the wrist?

While I applaud your candor for setting the record straight (*especially* in the Bitcoin industry where it seems like there are a disproportionate amount of "scammy" companies) this is definitely concerning.
In fact, I now feel less comfortable about the security of these devices than I did previously. Pretty much about how I'd feel if **I** was the one who had designed these wallets (as someone who does not have the requisite skills to do so).
After your initial problems did you hire people who actually knew what they were doing or was this more of a "learn as you go along" process?

Except that in the Kit-Kat sense a "break" is something positive, it's time off, it's relaxation.
The halving is exactly the opposite, it means miners now have to work TWICE as hard to achieve the same benefit.
That's why you're being called out on the joke falling flat.
