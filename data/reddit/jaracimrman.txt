Roger Ver stands behind bitcoin cash. He is known for his manipulative maneuvers and currently he is using his domain bitcoin.com to basically confuse newcomers into forcing them to use bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin. You can find more information around the web if you search for it and make your own opinion. I dont want to sound like a hater, but this is just how i feel about it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:51:59
Not if it's bitcoin cash.

Gemini is an exchange :) owned by winklevos brothers (known for facebook thing)
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:37:11
Actually, i personally use litecoin to transfer my btc between exchanges. But i dont see anything wrong with it?

Read the title again, he wont be able to own one, not fraction of one.

I go to Alza (big PC and electronic shop in the pic) several times a month and usually there is no line, probably busy christmas evening, its always swarmed there around 5-7 PM, people picking up christmas gifts and stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:03:35
I smell a bcash shill
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:53:39
Fair enough, i just have bad experience with private schools, they are usually overpriced normal schools, except your children get free pass because you pay.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:39:18
Did you seriously just put your wallet addresses into a meme pic? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:21:25
Trezor is open-source unlike Ledger! 
That alone is enough for me to NOT buy Ledger. (You buy hw wallet to keep coins safe but its closed source wtf!)

Your're worth $4M and you need to cash out crypto to pay off mortgage?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:24:00
Well, maybe because the correction is inevitable.
Or they just want to buy christmas presents.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:14:56
I would use LTC for that.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:36:48
If you want the rest of the world to use bitcoin, this is not the approach you want to go with.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:03:04
Most secure in a way that your cloud photos get hacked into.
You dont know what code they are running there. 
And to keep your seed somewhere where it can be potentially compromised is just no no.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:55:04
The other currencys exchange rate plays a role here too.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:30:10
Just panic sell already, so i can buy some.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:30:35
Lol ~ private school
I could find better ways to waste money.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:02:21
Please please let it sit there, some coins can give you huge returns in few years while on others u can only lose 100%
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:02:38
They are stealing money since June.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:29:24
What is a liberal?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:08
Smart buy on the dip and sell on the high after dip. But if you dont dare just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:10:04
Yes but with Trezor, you can read the code and spot the bugs in code yourself. And as more people use it, more people are auditing the code, it's a public information.
With Ledger, you're relying on a private company to do that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:08:59
No it's not. Firmware is closed-source.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:04:35
Lemme make some popcorn.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:25:54
As of now, definitely not small transactions.
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:15:54
Reverse psychology, bruh.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:13
Bitcoin is correcting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:46
It's the other way around. People are unintentionally DDoSing exchanges because bitcoin is going down, they want to sell and buy.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:00:55
Why couldnt he fuck his private yacht?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:27
Crashing. Ha. This was correction what we were all waiting for... time to slowly buy more.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:14:13
RemindMe! 3 years
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:13:32
Its time to buy more when it drops, duh.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:00:18
Coinbase is known for ridicoulosly high fees on small transactions, find some other exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:02:01
RemindMe! 5 years
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:39:29
It is still possible...
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:19:27
Not a good time to buy BTC after it reached ATH, significant correction will happen soon.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:39:19
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:24:56
1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:47:05
My prediction: dip down to 4-5k in upcoming 2 months. Then slow rise to 10k.
RemindMe! 3 months
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:51:27
I will buy more when that happens :) i have like $25 in btc and alts in total, just testing some day trading for now before the dip.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:22:24
Not really :) deposit is free and fees is 0.25% per trade
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:09:55
It could have been very well worth $0.01 too.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:26:24
It's bad time right now, we are just a few days after reaching ATH, a correction will follow. When that happens, BTC will dip into 3-4000 dollar range, you can buy then.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:07:38
What do you mean? I dont know all the word shortcuts :)
