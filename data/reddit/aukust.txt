I'd say that there is certainly a possibility for that especially when viewed from a (skewed) perspective of a long time holder like me. That's mostly why I have sold only about ~15% of my initial coins bought in 2013.
Even if Bitcoin doesn't become a "global currency", I think that it would still have enough utility to have a lot of value.

Actually, SEPA transfers take up to 2 days.


I agree that coinbase is easier to use and has some advantages compared to some exchanges but there are a lot of reliable services that makes buying bitcoin fast fairly easy. I'm just saying that this post sounds juuust a bit over enthusiastic

It doesn't really matter if Bitcoin was founded by someone whose identity is known in my opinion. It isn't a security feature at all to anyone else but that founder(s) if they would feel that they would get into trouble because of it. It would actually be more advantageous to Bitcoin if the people who made it were known as they most likely hold enormous amounts of Bitcoins, if they haven't dumped all those private keys which I doubt.
It doesn't matter who founded Bitcoin, but it does matter that they probably have almost 1 million BTC. In that sense Bitcoin is pre-mined if the owner of those coins is Satoshi.
I just hate this "everything is good news" thinking really.

Armory can do something like this, not a simple key but with offline wallet and watching-only wallet that runs on online computer. You have to confirm every transaction with a signature from that offline computer.

Meant to respond to this. No sensible individual accepts credit card payment as a payment for a car. In the case of a bank transaction, you can ask for the money but neither the bank or the seller is instantly liable to return the 10k. If both the bank and the individual refuses, you have to go the legal route anyway was it cash, bank transfer or BTC.

It's very volatile as the value of it mostly stems from speculation about future use. If it was really useful as a transfer of value, why would it be anywhere near as volatile? Crypto right now acts how it actually is currently - a high risk investment with some little useful value as a currency.


How does road building and other public services relate to money creation and its control? Roads are built mostly by tax income, which could be deducted from anything that could be classed as currency like gold and other things in the past. Having crypto as the de facto currency wouldn't decimate taxes.


There being little regulation for crypto doesn't mean that there couldn't be any. You can't track cash transactions either and grey economy still exists with the current system. Blockchain analysis has gotten pretty good and now it's pretty easy to track it if you know how and there is enough incentive to do so. Tracking bank transactions between countries and people isn't that easy either.

At least Thai police seem to take it pretty seriously. How does insurance or financial institutions relate to contract law? It can sure but not usually. 
I know that here in Finland you would get the other part of the contract easily liable if they sold you a car for bitcoin and the car blew its engine immmediately for example.

Long term stability is poor for fiat currencies. We currently try to overcome this with issuing of new money trough the banking system and other methods like controlling lending via reference rates and other regulation. The current methods to control the market and the economy seem to me like patching a boat with duct tape. No one seems to agree how you ultimately should control economy.


Governments and tax officials are monitoring the transactions in the blockchain right now as we speak! At the moment you need trust between banks and the government to operate the system sufficiently. Crypto could help with that by transferring the trust needed between the parties right now to the fundamental mathematics behind crypto. Anyone could look into the public blockchain to confirm the transactions and track them with no other parties in between. There are huge money laundering schemes that have been exposed before and investigated right now that have been allowed to happen by the banks as they can profit from it.
I personally really dislike the 'libertarian' part of the circlejerk here with taxes etc. as I do not see that happening in any way like many here talk about. I see that crypto could eliminate the need for the current role that banks and some business enjoy and the benefits could be distributed forward by the government through taxation for example. This would obviously not be very beneficial without a strong a government that cares for the people e.g a strong democracy.

You can't charge back a bank transaction on a car from another induvidual, that you purchased with it as a payment method in most countries. The bank shouldn't be allowed to make that crageback and if they did, you probably just committed fraud.

I think altcoins can be only positive for cryptocurrencies. They implement new features in them and many times work as a small scale experiment or test. With them, you can better detect possible improvements or flaws that can be implemented in Bitcoin too.

BTC is most definitely covered as a mean of transaction if that is mentioned in the agreement / contract of sale. That is how I buy cars myself from another individual! In this context it doesn't matter what the payment actually is, what matters is the payment that is required for the car to be the property of the buyer. If they want to pay with a bank transaction, I write it down on the agreement. 
With BTC, you could write in the contract that the X amount of BTC has to be transferred to address X. With that agreement, you are legally as covered as with cash or a bank transaction.
You could even state in the contract that you trade the car for another physical object and the argument would be as valid.

I don't know how fucked up banking is in USA but in Finland you usually don't pay any fees on anything except if you take a loan. This is including ALL customers not just rich folks. Those who have more money on their accounts get special benefits with loans and investing of course but that is different.

And just to note, Germany is the most influential nation in the EU

Yep, the thing why I got into Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies again is when I found a wallet file from my old HDD. It was just 9 BTC but it was much needed for me. I already sold most of it but I also bought some litecoins with it too.
After that crash in April I wanted to buy some more BTC. I didn't need though because soon I found 6 BTC from my old mtgox account. 
But some BTC is never coming back, that is my mined ~20 BTC at slush's pool, automatically donated to pool operator.
