Try not paying your taxes. This is more than "demand" this is the law.

In the long run I never said it did, but as it stands now, it is the PRIME MOTIVATOR for peoples desire to acquire debt notes.

**The Key Role of Taxes**
The answer is that Federal taxes must be paid in fiat money.  Every Federal Reserve note contains the inscription: This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private.  A note has no value other than the promise behind it.  However declaring it to be legal tender in settlement of debts between private parties would not be sufficient.  **But the need to acquire fiat money in order to pay one's taxes guarantees its value as money.**

What makes you think I'm pro-fiat? I posted those facts to show how the system works. I am not supporting the scam by doing so. You're an idiot to assume I am.

Physical will always be more valuable than virtual. Sure we would all love to have 1 bitcoin be worth $1,000,000,000.00. But if you had that much money, you would start seeking gold and a place to store it. Bitcoin could be wiped out but your gold remains valuable pretty much forever. Unless there is discovered a way to reproduce gold easily out of thin air? That would be pretty crazy. What would also be crazy is quantum computing causing Bitcoin wallets to become easily crackable and the entire infrastructure to become insecure.
