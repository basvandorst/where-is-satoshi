Lol yes. This is a gold rush buddy. Winners make it big and losers cry tears. Do you have the weener that it takes to be a winner?

Funny that this guy is concerned about fraud against himself while actively trying to defraud the government. Shit like this is not good for Bitcoin as it will guarantee that the regulatory dogs will be all over the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:20:49
Talks about "diversified investments" and buys bitcoin. LOL
There is no reason why this shit should bounce back at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:38:35
Nope. This party has just begun. Blood of pigs will fill the streets.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:00:28
Just about all of those alt coins have no fundamentals or reason to exist at all. People are buying them and praying to the heavens that some other idiot comes along and buy it from them for a higher price. It is literally gambling.
My friend said he put $500 into COLX and if it goes to 0.2 USD he would have made 100k... Why would it go to 0.2 USD? He has no reason to believe it will at all. He just 'hopes' it does.

Not sure what is dumber... calling Facebook, Google and Amazon bubbles or comparing their valuation to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:41:43
If you consider your fiat money worthless can I have it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:59:28
Why don't you just sell and collect your money? 5.5k on a 25k investment is still a huge gain in just a month... If bitcoin recovers you can always come back in.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:53:59
You think is not gambling? lmao. Just look at the name of the sub.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:12:33
Fuck trump
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:33:39
A guy I met that worked for Nortel also HODLed on it. He lost every penny he had and now can't retire.
When bubbles pop things get bad and the last sucker still in is the one who is completely ruined.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:24:45
Cool! Thanks for this.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:06:07
just checked and bitcoin is only up 2.3% in 24 hours.. SUCH RECOVERY HOLY SHIT
Also remember it took almost 2 years for the .com bubble to fully crash from peak.

@_date: 2018-01-31 16:47:23
Lmaoooooo jesus. Well people were always saying it is a classic bubble.  Based on this sub we are easily at "fear" right now
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:15:24
Mortgage your house then. Free money right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:22:28
Killing the planet... :/
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:24:27
Anyone buying right now is like a pig for the slaughter.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:46:37
lmao. Who uses it for daily transactions outside of drug dealers?
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:35:35
Canadians don't pay taxes for gambling winnings. If it is gambling then we shouldn't pay tax for bitcoin profits. Only fair right :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:49:54
Did you buy at 20k?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:29:26
Looks like 'Denial' everyone.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:03:54
Smart people guaranteeing their profits during the bubble mania phase and people putting up stop losses as this crash is too much for their risk tolerance. None of that is dumb. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:23:13
I'm more concerned about the idiots hoping for it to crash so they can keep on buying more for cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:01:51
We all here for Lamborghinis. You promised us!
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:57:00
It kept crashing and he kept on buying more and more and more. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket AND work for that very company. I'm in the telecom industry so I meet many of these miserable people.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:20:12
Yes. Bitcoin is bleeding in a cycle of crashes, small recovery, stabilization, failure to get any upward momentum and then another crash occurs. This is a typical pattern of a bursting bubble. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:41:13
For the lambos
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:38:11


Could just keep on crashing..
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:05:40
Doesn't look like a dip to me. More like a sinking ship. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:48:11
$ETH is down almost 30%...
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:10:12
Another name for hodler : bag holder. At least it is a Gucci bag right now.. Keep holding and it will be a plastic bag.
