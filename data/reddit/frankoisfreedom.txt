Since he's a coward who doesn't stand by his own words and deleted his reply as I made mine, here's the deleted comment for posterity and my reply: 
No im sorry. Random septic tanks arent really my thing.
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:40:56
So that's why you *think* you are replying. You think you have control of your impulse to reply or not. That's so cute!

And its not just directed at bitcoin, all the altcoins suffer from dissent causing trolls that cant be reasoned with and so closely mirror paid actors.

He worked for and contacted more than just that guy, a good handful of sites yall used everyday back then were influenced by him directly, I know a couple of altcoin exchanges.

@_date: 2015-12-04 22:34:37


Interesting.. How would that work? By trying to rewrite history in a favorable way? If you have bitcoin in a UTXO how can I "steal" it with out your key? Then if Idont own any of the keys in the transaction chain how can I rewrite history in my favor if I cant sign any of the TX's? I guess we could write new rules in a fork but who would want to honor that hostile chain?
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:36:28
It wasnt his fault, there really was no way for him to know that it would go this high. None of us really knew. We all hoped for it but it all seemed like a fantasy. I sold most of what I had in 2011. -shrug-
@_date: 2015-06-17 00:41:35
Idk man, that sounds pretty shocking to me.

@_date: 2015-12-18 12:52:54
its not entirely just that, its a way to have immutable past history as well, but i guess if you are the only miner on the chain you could then  redo all the work and rewrite history if you truly wanted to.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:08:30
oh yea? What happened here? 
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:39:27
he did it single handed?!?!!?
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:48:11
thats exactly what multipools do to altcoins which introduces incredibly wild swings the longer it goes on.
@_date: 2015-12-04 02:30:52
It didnt say that to me at all, it said that he was conniving and actively trying to further launder more of his ill gotten gains.

LETS GO TOM!
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:43:14
I'm working on something similar right now 
Still working on it obviously, but the way it will work is this.
Users create an account, and logs in, then they have to verify they control atleast one address with a balance &gt;= 1 which unlocks voting power and the ability to create projects.
Each project will have many tasks to complete. Each task of the project will have a donation address. If you donate to a task or project via a linked address you are awarded with more votes and your rank in the leader boards will go up. You can also earn rank by completing tasks aswell as the funds donated to the tasks.
No where near completion but, that is the idea. Perhaps someone can now use my idea to win this 100k because im sure it wont be me lol.

The vary nature of cryptocurrency says "we need to stop ny residents" goes AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT IS CRYPTO. Its a decentralized system that is ment to be disruptive because it cant be stoped and regulations like this are the competitions attempt at flexing a little muscle. Its ridiculous and only cast a huge spotlight on their intellect. The hydra cannot be killed by cutting off heads. This is merely an attempt to cut off heads.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:04:56

oh yea sorry if i came off rude, i agree its a first step! I think reality people is a service that could actually hold btc as opposed to someone who needs to replace inventory and the inventory cost usd. Good job getting them to accept!
@_date: 2014-08-22 14:02:55
That you can. No one is stopping you. Bitpay is working on a way to donate via bitpay, but that is also doing exactly what im proposing lol :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:51:23
Maybe they should offer FRK instead
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:31:04
What if no one acknowledges their license? Who are they to even THINK they have the right to regulate a market that is outside the scope of their existence. Hilarious.

this is an amazing idea for a service!!
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:04:31
Perhaps there needs to be a client that automatically does this.

@_date: 2014-11-14 18:28:56
read the fuckin article, they dont want fiat which is why they are creating their own currency. They arnt making their own currency to sell for fiat. There is a reason they want to use precious metals, and that reason is there is already a demand for precious metals. I'm not creating the demand the demand already exist. Would I buy an oz of gold that is severly undervalued just because it has an isis logo on it? You are damn right I would, then I would melt it down and put a FRK logo on it. And I would gladly trade and piece of paper to do that. Call it flawed, call it foolish, idgaf. I'm thinking about tomorrow not today.

thats an amazing idea. I know this is the bitcoin subreddit but what about the ability to spread an altcoin like Franko around?
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:10:33
cant, im shackled to my deathbed with chains of debt and locks of poverty.
@_date: 2014-07-12 12:38:19
so true
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:28:00
that is the wet dream of crypto
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:08:39
Well reddit is anonymous so they could have some shills employed to frame the conversation.
@_date: 2014-07-26 12:06:27
I wonder when they are going to try and enforce this on the blockchain. They must be trying to go after satoshis million bitcoins haha

@_date: 2014-11-14 16:10:02
The biggest terrorist are the ones supplying the fiat. The fiat you would trade for the gold has a high likely hood to go to near zero. All fiats have went to zero. So why not give them fiat, take their actual assets and bankrupt the fuck out of them? 
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:32:05

Havnt got that far yet. I'll be consulting an attourney tomorrow. The main thing im wondering about is, is it an ATM or is it a vending machine. Because you can only purchase BTC with it. The atm does not pay dollars for btc. Also, you have to preload the machine with btc so it feels more retail then it does like an exchange. Another thing, fincen doesnt define a money transmitter if you are doing under $1000/day in business. Is that $1000 in profit or is it $1000 total sales? I'm sure someone will have to get paid in order for you to make any money, thats usually how life works. Just not sure who.

If you can rob them of actual assets by giving them worthless paper, yea i think that is a really good thing. We both want the same thing you just want it differently and feel like fiat is the only thing of value. Which is surprising coming from a bitcoin subreddit.

I run 3 full nodes. ^_^ Mostly because of the warm fuzzy feeling of doing a good deed but it would be nice if there was more of an incentive to do so, because if the warm fuzzy feeling isnt enough to secure the network against double spending its probably not enough to keep it decentralized and fault tolerant either.

I thnk someone here doesnt understand what fractional reserve means, im sure they are going to google it and be like "i knew this all along" then write a huge paragraph to be consistent with the original fud claim.

Well its not like who I am is a secret or like the funds arnt transparently stored on a publicly shared ledger or anything lol But I do believe in trustless systems so i'd prefer you went through bitpay but at this second in time that isnt an option and you still have to trust someone ;) OR you could send the raw transaction on a carrier pigeon if that makes you feel safer.

How to get others to use the new pools though? Why would I mine and get less at a new pool rather than stay where I am at the pool getting the most blocks?

@_date: 2016-01-12 00:33:37
Its sort of hard to argue that one, anyone can create as many fake zero conf transactions as they want, only the txs with big enougn fees to go into the blockchain are real, its why since the beginning of bitcoin time its best to wait for atleast 1 confirm but 6 is the standard for certainty.
@_date: 2016-01-12 00:43:39

@_date: 2016-01-12 13:31:43
Perhaps you are right, but &lt;---- its a feature not really an exploit, the software allows for it by default. Are all the people doing illegal things when a block is orphaned and they get their coins back?
@_date: 2016-01-12 00:36:04
Everyone has known about the risks of accepting 0-conf transactions, coinbase is betting that not many people will do it so accepting 0 conf transactions will net more money than lose. Coinbase is playing a game of russian roulette, sometimes they will shoot themselves.

lol that has absolutely nothing to do with it.
"With the soft fork, transactions which interact with a DAO will not fit within these two classes: they will fail execution but no gas will be charged. This must inevitably be the case in any soft fork that aims to freeze the stolen funds; since the protocol does not specify a “DAO Interaction Exception,” miners must either include the transaction in their block along with all of its resultant state changes, or they must exclude the transaction entirely, and forfeit any gas reward."
It doesnt cost ANYTHING hence the problem.

But the moment you fuck the attacker you also get fucked because you open up a can of worms and paint a huge regulatory target on your backs. The moment they exert control of the chain and its funds they are completely liable for all the value on that blockchain and ethereum becomes permissioned. Then the value goes to nothing as the rats abandon a sinking ship.

@_date: 2017-01-07 11:06:19
no bitcoins are values stored on a distributed ledger that have a puzzle associated with them that is basically like this.
"only the person who can solves this puzzle can move these values to a  new puzzle that only someone who can solve that puzzle can move"
So the keys associated unlock the puzzle.
So a tx looks like this...
x amount of value is now owned by this new key ~ with love, previous key.
and when you want to send a new tx you scan the blockchain for values that have been assigned to your key and when you send them it looks like.
if value has been assigned to me, assign them to somewhere else in the amount specified, ~ with love, my key

crazily better than you might think. Because every hash has an equal opportunity at finding a block as the next hash, the object of the game is to do as many hashes as possible and there for more tries. but hash 1 and hash 123 vigintillion are equally likely to be the block solution.

@_date: 2015-04-20 02:53:19
Show me a single altcoin thats price doubled when they halved. It seems logical that, if the demand is the same and the supply is lowered the price would go up, but supply and demand isnt really the principle behind mining. The driving force of mining is incentive. The incentive to mine will be half of what it once was, if the price doesnt magically double like you are suggesting then it will cause an even heavier sell side and drive the price even further down. Ill get downvoted by the bitcoin puritans all day but we have seen this happen with all the altcoins with swift halving schedules. It was so bad for doge they had to merge with ltc or die.

Why do only merchants have to pay in bitcoin? When making bitcoin, the incentive to to "work" for bitcoin securing the blockchain was earning bitcoin, the rest came after. We need to create more ways for people to earn bitcoin. As it stands now, merchant acquisition isnt BAD but again, it shouldnt be the focus, because if you increase the way to earn them, than people will create ways to spend them. That's what we have learned so far from the history of bitcoin.

lol so i can use my fiat to buy btc to give it to uber so they can sell it to fiat? Or do you want to be a driver who accepts btc? Fuck adding new merchants, I want to see employers paying their employees in btc. Adding merchants only helps those who already have bitcoin, spend their bitcoin. It doesnt give me an incentive to buy bitcoin.

Negative, that isnt the solution but that is what the system promotes. Because it punishes those who do spend them with future prices. Which is why I think fiat is so inflationary, to promote spending. Inflation forces people to spend more today because tomorrow it will be worthless.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:40:37

@_date: 2013-10-14 12:27:25
Mining is completely busy work. Those computations are random numbers, they arnt processing transactions they are trying to guess a huge number.  If they guess the huge number, then they put transactions into the block, but the actual mining is just wasted energy. The concept of hashcash is to prove that they have worked for X amount of time.

The proof of stake concept is nice, minus the fact that it increases the reward for early adopters and completely centralizes the coin faster then most of its alternatives. Especially when you look at the initial distribution of the coins. 10% of the entire mint was minted in just a few days, then the blockreward was cut down so low that it would take ages to catch up to the instamine.
