If you are asking this question to random people on a message board, you will have bigger issues.

Are you naïve enough to think linking a drug deemed illegal in most countries with a currency that attempts to rival national currency is a good idea?  
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:26:16
How arrogant and misinformed you must be.  In times of panic, there are times where it is profitable to buy.  At other times, people lose everything.
Knowing half the story is more harmful than not knowing it at all.

If you people are so serious about Bitcoin, why is the question that OP has posted not been the most asked about question here?  So few people are actually able so spend Bitcoins, and all the focus is on this bubble of an investment.
He questions on how to spend Bitcoins, and you guys reply how many fees there are if you don't actually want to take volatility risk in holding Bitcoin.
Once I see a solution to Squidot47's problem, maybe I would have faith that Bitcoin is not doomed to be worthless.

Past price determines future price?  I don't think so.  Time to take Finance 101.

Shorting just adds to efficiency of a market.  If price is too high above equilibrium, it brings market back into check.  If price is too low, shorts get destroyed by people entering in value trades on the long side.
Your comments are obviously biased though.  I'm sure you have no problem with people taking long positions on margin, and driving the price up....right?
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:06:32
Most people here are uber bulls, and for them it is always a good time to buy.  I am a bear, and think Bitcoins' eventual value will be near zero.
Don't listen to people on forums, you need to do your own research.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:55:36
You put a lot of trust in organizations that handle Bitcoin.  Many do not share your trust.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:45:53
That's not my point.  My point is that the USD is backed by the stability of the US gov't.  Bitcoin is backed by faith of people continuing to use it as a trading medium.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:50:21
Not what I was implying.  But to say that future price is some function of past price (eg. a rate of growth) has no basis.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:30:51
Maybe it will go up, I'm not pretending I know.  But what credentials do you have in determining what "equilibrium" is?
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:02:52
His arguments are valid.  Not to say Bitcoin is doomed to fall to zero, but you dismiss the probability it could.  As for it being backed by nothing, he is right.
As much as you think he is closed minded, you are also closed minded.

I'm a bit confused.  Are you basing your opinion on valuation from random people on a Reddit message board?
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:00:20
Why should he subsidize others?  You greedy pig.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:56:06
Now you must realize how people with backgrounds in economics and finance feel when people with little to no knowledge or experience in finance or economics go about proclaiming to be experts in asset valuation in a such an item as.........bitcoin.

Why is "their" and "there" so difficult for people?
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:03:35
There really isn't one unless credit cards stop being accepted.  For legal transactions, people have so many methods to spend without Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:33:30
It's backed by the ability of the US gov't to generate tax revenue.
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:29:48
You overestimate the influence Reddit has outside of this forum.

More likely those who have had their coins stolen were more likely to keep their coins than spend or sell them.  Those who have stolen the coins are more likely to sell them.  This puts upward pressure on supply, and leads to a price decrease (until a hypothetical equilibrium is reached).

The word you should be looking for is "if"

Nope, Bitcoin isn't an asset.  You fail to understand finance or economics here.  It is like saying the demand of a paper currency is determined by it's volume in circulation.  If you want to value Bitcoin as an asset, it is worth zero. Simply that is where you have a giant disconnect with simple economic concepts.
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:34:24
Market cap?  This isn't an equity that generates revenue, with the underlying asset being a present value of future income.  It is a currency.  The volume in existence has zero economic information.  The volume only is impactful as to what level of inflation or deflation is anticipated, and whether there is enough currency to satisfy demand of transactions.
Bitcoin is not an asset (only is asset in the sense of those mining them), it is a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:39:39
1) No, current price gives no information on future price.
2) Yes, but it is in the midst of a bubble.  Demand is not for demand for use of transactions, but speculation.  Also, many people are hoarding supply for same speculation purpose.
3) Yes, future supply is known.
4) No, price has little to do with future demand.  Price of the currency here is not driven by normal supply/demand, it is driven by speculation.
Bitcoin is not an asset because it has no intrinsic value.  Paper currency is not an asset, it is a token for exchange.  That's why you keep speaking of Bitcoin increasing in value if it increases in use.  This is not the case.  Bitcoin generates no revenue for an owner of a Bitcoin, and has no intrinsic value.  An asset like an equity, if they increase profit, this goes to owners, and that's why the equity would increase in value.  If a Bitcoin increases the number of transactions, an owner of a Bitcoin receives no profit from this.
