A thing is a siutable store of value if it has use.
If many people go around saying that Bitcoin is a store of value just look at the charts (meaning "it has value because it has value"), make easy game for everyone to call it a ponzi scheme.

This is very generous of you, and I appreciate your time. It's the best post in the thread.
Can I ask a couple of followups?
I'm also a programmer in IT for 10 years. I fail to see why 2x block size would signify costly hardware. Disk space aside, my laptop ran the reference clinet just fine, and I'm sure it'd run 2x or even 8x just fine. 1 megabyte every 10 minutes is negligible, and so is 8mb. The memory is constrained my the mempool value (if I understand correctly) which is 25mb but adjustable. As long as I'm not running a pool, I feel I wouldn't really be affected; and if I do run a pool, I'm already on good hardware with great bandwidth. Disk space aside, obvisously - I recognize that the chain can't just grow indefinitley. 
Second: who controls the Lightening/sidechain? Or are there multiple sidechains, maybe? I understand that a sidechain can help/ resolve the scaling problem, but is there 100% guarantee that it won't make bitcoin less secure? I understand that Blockstream has patents in sidechain tech. I understand (correct me) that sidechains are optional, but would be de facto necessary to buy a coffe (ie. use bitcoin as a currency).
Thanks in advance

SegWit does not have patents. BitcoinCore website explains SegWit and stuff around it pretty well, spent an hour there last night.
Reason why probably you read that, is that people say that SegWit is an important part to enable Lightning.
Blockstream does have a patent in sidechains 
(Here's also another patent by Blockstream on blockchain tech  )
My concern with lightning/sidechains is: who is going to controll it? Will it be 100% under community control like the blockchain is?
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:05:49
The other camp wording makes this pretty ambiguous.
Edit: oh wait that post is from a few days ago. I did mean to ask: during the Agreements, did Core have an official stance?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:24:25
There are lots of hidden interests in all camps nobody will tell you.
The miners want to keep the fees high forever, and don't want a sidechain/Lightning.
Blockstream, which has tight connections with Core, on the other hand, has patents in sidechains, and SegWit is an important part of enabling Lightning on Bitcoin.
The problem with patents is the permanent nature of the blockchain, once something is in, even for one block, it will stay there forever, and an evil party could milk it forever.
The opposing camp really liked their fees, and would prefer shortmid term solutions that would make Bitcoin just enough viable to make people use it.
If I understand it right, the two (8x and SegWit) parties did compromise on SegWit2x (in one of the Agreements?) but then Core went back to original SegWit.
It's just liars, shills and hidden interests everywhere, at this point. That's what drove me away from cryptos the last time, two years ago. Sigh. Trust no one.

Can you give an unbiased summary of the conflict?

vdogg89 did say "cash"
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:42:08
Also check the Core - Segwit2x debate. 
It's quite a wiggly tim to go all in, honestly. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:38:35
But did Core accept the SegWit2x agreement or at least provide an open stance about it?

I agree with your premises, but I see a problem in your thinking. Forks ARE part of the rules, and have been put in for good reason in the original design.
I still haven't undestood all of the stances of different parties, but forking is highly desirable.

BitcoinCore website does explain it nice, but they're the proponents. Detractors reside in r/btc but it's also difficult to get a clear response
Here's an explanation somewhere else itt
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:31:08
How much does/will opening/closing a channel cost? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:41:47
Thanks for the correction. r/btc wording makes this part difficult to interpret.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:18:36

You'll hardly find any neutral or bilateral opinion here.

Wait. I did read a bunch about channels, and what I get is that 
* channels have a fixed max amount
* channels have a fixed max duration
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:39:55
You can run 1gb block nodes on today's comodity hardware, or so was argumented in a recent speech by two trustworthy folks.

Bitcoin (SegWit) is also a store of value and also a settlement layer, but you can't really use it as money
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:05:37
You suggest 'shopping people in to the picture?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:42:58
Then have 5 minutes of digging on Core developers, and have fun ;)

I want a means of exchange, tho. I want to be able to *buy* things.

You don't even know the *first* thing about how bitcoin works. Sigh.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:03:10


How much does it cost, tho? If I want to send 5$ to Bob, do I need to open a channel for, Idk, 30$? If I want to create a payment group with my poker buddies, do I need to install an always-on hub for ourselves?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:21:33
On chain transactions are peer to peer but only for big payments / as a settlement layer.
Offchain layers enable micropayments, but aren't peer to peer anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:31:52
You can be a store of value even tho you're not money, tho.

Can I have a source on the simulations? What's dropping off, raspberry pi model 1? Or what? How many? Does it matter, as long as there are still many?
My point is, if you can run a node in the background on a laptop all of the time it's on, then the network is ok. 
I said it's a shitty debate, because as I see it, it's concentrated on the wrong hairsplitting. But I'm open on being convinced otherwise (with sources and technical discussion)
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:43:52
For refence on the orders on magnitude we're talcking about here is: 
you can run a full node on a today's laptop in background for at least the next years, disregarding if it's 1MB or 8MB. Or even a yesterday's laptop.
It's a shitty debate.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:44:35
Thank you and u/supermari0 for the links, I'll have a read. 
I'd like to say that it's not "indisputable" that the blockchain can't handle all of that traffic, as the coin was designed for it from the get-go (the whitepaper), that was the original vision. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying that convincing arguments are being made for both claims, so it's "disputable" at the very least.
I'll go have lunch, and then have a read now. Thanks again for the links.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:33:05
There is no way to force that. What if nobody makes a transaction and the block is empty? You still need to be able to mine blocks. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:47:55
It's  not medium.com. Never heard of it, and have no idea what's its relation to medium.com. The link does say medium.com tho.

@_date: 2017-10-05 15:02:25
Do you mean that it's bad for Bitcoin to become a settlement layer? I don't really like the idea of "opening a channel through a third party" to make my payment.

Who is the author?
What site is it? Never heard of it. The link from Reddit says "medium" but it's definitely not medium.com
Anyway, I have no reason to trust the author, and a motherfucking tweet is just a tweet. I've seen the Roger vs Tony debate the author mentioned, and it was ridiculous. One brought motherfucking **arguments**, which one could or could not support. The other didn't say **anything** besides "I trust the team to do the best thing". You can't lie if you don't say anything, can you.

There is a bug with syncing the blockchain on 0.15, that doesn't seem to be there in 0.14, discussed here  and by user u/dooglus elsewhere in this thread.
I'm not taking a stance here, but when you're making a fork, the last thing you want is that your nodes fail to sync.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:06:40
Where is the irony?
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:46:16
Exactly, mempools are local, and there's no way to *prove* that a miner *should have* included a certain transaction, because it's in *my* mempool. 
It's all in the game-theoretic incentives to ensure that selfish actors support the intended emerging behaviour.

What's the ETA for Lightning again?
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:15:52
Yes, the third parties in bitcoin are represented as the straight horizontal line in the right image.
I was talking about channels, nodes that are *special*, in that no "normal" user will run one.
And also it's kinda fixed, if I understand correctly (I "block" my funds, bound to a *specific* channel).
decentralization works well when/because all nodes are equal.

Won't the Lightning Network have a fee too? 
Splitting the fees between the miners and the channels, won't it render the network less secure?

Why not Proof of Stake, then? It's a proven protocol and is certailny resistant to 51% attacks, except if someone has more than 51% of the wealth, which is rather difficult.
