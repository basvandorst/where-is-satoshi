1/ It helps solve the transaction fee problem as well as the latency problem. Transaction fees are paid to miners to process your transaction on the blockchain. Lightning network transactions do not ordinarily happen on the blockchain or use miners. You do not need to pay them, since you're not ordinarily using them.
2/ The lightning network creates a new way to earn fees on bitcoin without being a miner, using a method that shares a couple similarities with the proof of stake system (though it also has significant differences from that system). It processes payments by passing along payment information through routing partners, who may charge a fee to route your payment. These routing partners compete with one another to offer the lowest fee structure. To become a routing partner you don't need to solve proof of work algorithms, because routing payments doesn't take a lot of computing power. Instead, you need to prove you have enough money to route payments for all your users, and stake that amount of money in bitcoin payment channels, whereupon you may begin charging competitive fees. This fee structure could make it easier for normal people to earn money on bitcoin without needing an enormous investment in computing hardware.
3/ No, routing partners are unlikely to become like Visa, for several reasons. One is that it is much easier to disconnect from a routing partner and find a new one than it is to disconnect from Visa and find a new debit card issuer. Getting a new debit card from one of Visa's competitors takes several business days and it gives them access to your private information and your bank account. Routing partners do not get any of that, and it takes only a few minutes to disconnect from one you don't like and find a new one. Also, a routing partner can be anyone on the lightning network. It doesn't have to be a large company.

All lightning channels on the network are publicly viewable by all nodes on the network, which is why it is possible to create comprehensive maps of the lightning network like the [recksplorer]( It would be a bit simplistic to say your node finds a route by checking this map, but it's not far from the truth: your node can view all available paths the same way that map can, and just selects the shortest/cheapest path.

Most of your problems involve keeping track of old contracts.
**You don't need to keep track of old contracts.** Throw them away and ignore them forever. Just keep track of the current valid contract and keep an eye on the blockchain. If any transaction is broadcast from your payment channel that differs from the current valid contract, you should broadcast the latest one.
This solution eliminates number 1 because it makes fraud detection easy and potentially rewarding.
It also eliminates number 2 because you don't need to keep track of old contracts.
It also eliminates number 3 because it eliminates the need for a public registry.
It also eliminates number 4 because it makes fraud detection easy and potentially rewarding.
It also eliminates number 5 because it eliminates the need for a public registry.
It also eliminates number 7 because the "fraud attempt" button becomes a "lose money" button.
It also eliminates number 8 because your channel partner can easily stop your fraud.
Problem 6 isn't affected by this solution. This doesn't mean number 6 is a real problem or that (if it is a real problem) there's no solution to number 6, it just means this solution doesn't affect number 6.

Here's a 17 step how-to guide for how to sign a cold storage transaction offline, without ever exposing your private key to an online device. The guide assumes you already have a cold storage address, such as a paper wallet.

Lol. No they're not. They're in a multisig address and you've got private keys to that address. You can take your funds out at any time. They're not locked in unless all bitcoin addresses keep bitcoins locked in. Moreover, you can spend them without taking them out if you want. So they're doubly not locked in.


No for two reasons. The lightning network doesn't require hubs, and your routing partners don't need any more money than the amount you want to spend.


A hub -- which is totally optional btw and no one needs to connect to any hub -- can get going without at first having any bitcoins. Here's how: suppose Acme corp decides to get on the lightning network. Customers want to pay Acme for their explosive products, so customers ask Acme to set up a LN channel with them. The company can let each customer fund a channel with however much they plan to spend on the lightning network, and then send some of that to Acme in return for a missile or whatever. As a result, Acme suddenly has channels open with several parties on the lightning network and funds in each channel -- but they haven't spent a dime. The customers did all the spending because that's what customers do -- they spend money, to Acme, for a product. People can now route payments through Acme because Acme now has the necessary liquidity -- and it wasn't expensive at all for Acme.

Sort of restricted. It's open source, so, it's kinda wink wink. I imagine there are amateurs like me who are hard at work creating unofficial patches to all this open source lightning software, putting together everything you need to make it work on the real blockchain. Some developers have already managed to make these changes, which is why there even *is* a lightning network on the real blockchain. I am confident an unofficial patch will be released before an official lightning client is released to the public.

Yes. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange offers options to "short" bitcoin, which means betting that its price will go down. If it does, you acquire money in proportion to the amount you bet.

It is not currently fast and cheap for All use-cases, but it is fast and cheap for some.
For example, consider international remittance. If Jim wants to send $2000 to his family in Africa, he can pay $50 to do it via Western Union and have it arrive whenever his family goes to pick it up at a Western Union place that might be miles away, or he can pay $5 and send it via the blockchain, where it arrives within the next hour or so. That is both faster and cheaper than one of bitcoin's major competitors in the remittance business.
Also, if you do a one-time transaction to connect to the new lightning network which just started rolling out, you can then make all your future bitcoin transactions on that network for less than a penny per transaction, with confidence that the speed of each transaction will be less than 5 seconds. Google the lightning network for more information. This new software has already begun rolling out, and companies like BitRefill and TorGuard already let you pay them via that method. Nearly free and nearly instant bitcoin transactions are here, at least for users and companies that have adopted this new software -- which, admittedly, isn't very many yet.

Even so, if the price dropped to, say, $300 per coin, even the mining farm guys couldn't afford to pay their electricity bills with that amount of dough. The block reward plus fees right now is like, what, 14 btcs? So if you multiply $300 times 14 it would be $4200 net. I'm confident that the electricity bills for a btc farm are more than that can cover, even if they mine several blocks per month and don't have to split up the profits. So there is a limit to how low the price can go where big miners stay profitable -- and if it goes below that for long enough, some big miners would have to shut down.

But Bank G does transmit money. The numbers in the accounts are the money. Something else happens with lightning nodes. They just transmit information to the recipient, and the recipient may use that information to change the numbers himself, on the blockchain. The intermediary doesn't change any numbers -- she just transmits a data packet from the buyer to the merchant, and that data packet contains information that the merchant can use to conduct a blockchain transaction on his own.

It appears that the new easiest way to buy bitcoin is with the Cash app from Square. You can buy bitcoins with only a phone number and no further verification, though to withdraw them from the Square wallet you have to give them your name and the last four digits of your social security number.

Yeah, the number of nodes is roughly equal, but the channel count is different and so is the total channel balance. You can see the total channel balance difference with these screenshots: 
At present, robtex shows a total channel balance of over 3.9 bitcoins, whereas Recksplorer says the total channel balance is 314490418 satoshis, which is less than 3.2 total bitcoins. That's a big difference. It's about a $10000 difference, really.
I just figured out why the number of channels is so much bigger on robtex though. Robtex is counting each channel twice, once each for both of the nodes it's connecting. If you double 650 you get 1300, which is still a hundred and one less than 1401, but it gets me most of the way to an explanation for that part. I'm guessing the additional ~.8 bitcoins robtex sees is related to the additional 101 channels that robtex sees. But why doesn't the recksplorer see those channels?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:32:03
Nope. Channels don't expire. Each transaction in a lightning channel has a relative timelock that is minable before the previous signed transaction. You may broadcast the latest one at any time and it will be mined when its time comes. BTW the channel is not a contract. You may broadcast the latest signed transaction and leave the channel with or without your counterparty's cooperation, and you may broadcast your departure transaction at any time.

You can create a lightning channel without spending a dime. Your half of the channel would be empty initially, but if you could find someone who wanted to send you money over the lightning network (an exchange perhaps?), you could create a channel with them and then receive payments through that channel. So it is possible to receive money without (you) paying a fee -- but someone else would have to pay a fee to open the channel and also send money to you. (An exchange, though, could deduct the fee from whatever amount you purchased, as some exchanges currently do for other on-chain deposits.)

Pruned nodes help the network in several ways. The main *personal* benefit of running a node -- even a pruned one -- is that it prevents people from connecting you to a network you don't want to be on, like what almost happened when Copay wallet (nearly) switched all their users over to Segwit2x. Running a pruned node prevents wallet providers from doing that to you.
This *personal* benefit also helps the overall network. The more people who run full nodes -- even pruned ones -- the more people there are who personally make sure that their transactions are on the real bitcoin network. This is not just how the network grows -- it is also part of how it remains secure, because wallet providers don't want to switch over their users to a network that has few users. Keeping the bitcoin network "active" with a pruned node keeps it alive -- every bit of added life is added security.
Also, while other nodes can't download the blockchain from a pruned node, they can get other network data, including mempool information. This helps the network. And there is an upgrade in the works to allow neighboring nodes to download the *most recent* blocks from pruned nodes, which is cool because then they'll be helping out their neighboring nodes in additional ways.

I believe the gentleman who currently has the username and password for the main Github repo goes by the username laanwj, and is also known as wumpus on IRC.
However, since the github project is open source, you can connect to the bitcoin network without using that particular project's code. Bitcoin Knots is another project which regularly produces independent node software that can connect to the bitcoin mainnet, share blocks, and verify transactions.
You can even write your own node client from scratch if you want to. As long as it follows the rules of the bitcoin network, and as long as it can connect to other nodes on the bitcoin mainnet, we'll consider you a valid node even if you don't run a single line of code from the main github repo.
Hardforks are made by creating node software that follows different rules than all the other nodes. If you do that, then other people who download your software can connect to your node, but yall can't connect to the bitcoin mainnet. So you count as a fork.

The hub can initially pass along up to 10 BTCs to the shop, and if the shop wishes to push bitcoins through the hub, it too can initially pass up to 10 BTCs through the hub. If the hub passes all 10 of it's BTCs to the shop, and the shop doesn't send any of those back through the hub, then the hub is exhausted. It can no longer pass bitcoins to the shop until it is replenished either by the shop passing bitcoins back through the hub or by adding more bitcoins to the channel via an on-chain transaction. Also, you don't have to open a channel directly with every shop; as long as they are on the same network you're on, you can send them money.

There's a third possibility: mining profitability could go down. There's no reason why mining profitability has to stay stable.

Coinbase uses non-anonymous wallets. If they wanted to start something like this all they'd have to do is integrate lightning. The problem for them is, you can't force people to use their system or to connect to their node. All it takes to create a wallet is a coin to flip or a dice to roll or any other method of generating random numbers. Once you have a private key (which is a random number), no one can stop you from making and receiving anonymous bitcoin payments. As an example, I recently helped my seven year old nephew make an online purchase from Amazon using his own bitcoins. He would never have been able to do that if he had to register at a certified bank first. But no one can stop you once you know how to use bitcoins.

I would say "Cool, good luck! Be aware that you can get lower fees if you use this other wallet (and then I'd refer her to a LN client)."
If she wants to know about underlying details or whatnot, I'll answer any questions she has, but users probably don't want or need to know about that. The UX they need to deal with is "Put your money in this address, spend with lower fees." That's not a hard sentence to say and you can say it in a bunch of user-friendly ways.
 


The justification for an average user is lower fees. You don't need to tell them about the internal problems, and if they're interested in those problems, you still have the option to tell them if you want to.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:04:06
This is a good chart.
You could also rephrase it: over 70% of LN nodes can continue sending payments if the most connected node goes offline. (Putting it this way makes it sound positive.)
Also important to note: for the 30% of people connected to SleepyArk, if SleepyArk goes offline, that doesn't mean you can't make a payment. It means you can't make a lightning payment. Your payment might have to wait 10 minutes and cost 30 cents or so -- but it will still go through.

You can certify your own wallet. Use your private key to create a digital signature and attach that signature to any document. This does not reveal your private key, but it does prove that you own the private key (and wallet) that you used to create the signature.

No, I don't think so. A lot of people don't mind connecting to a large node, but plenty of people will be skeptical of the motives of large nodes and will refuse to connect to them. Large nodes will certainly be there if people want to use them -- but connecting to a large node is optional, as is routing your transaction through one. So if you don't want to use a large node, just don't connect to them and tell your node to select routes that ignore nodes you don't like.

It is nice that Square Cash lets you try out crypto trading and exchanging. But there is a significant limitation: you can only use those bitcoins within the Square Cash platform. 
And that disadvantage leads straight to a tin foil hat conspiracy theory: Square might not even be storing real bitcoins on your behalf. They might just be remembering what the btc price was when you hit the "buy" button and then they can simply adjust your USD balance based on how much the value of bitcoin has changed. If you send it to another Square Cash user, they send that amount of dollars, but not any actual bitcoins. The only way to know they're holding actual bitcoins on your behalf is if they let you take those bitcoins out of their system -- which they aren't currently allowing.
BTW just because I'm criticizing a limitation doesn't mean I don't appreciate Square's support for bitcoin. I do appreciate it, and I'm fairly confident they are indeed storing actual bitcoins. But we should be aware of the limitations of using their platform. The only way to be sure they can't censor your transactions is if you can move your bitcoins to a wallet that they can't touch. And they don't currently allow that, which I don't like, though I do like some of the other things Square does.

They aren't giving it to you for nothing, they are giving it to you in return for a data packet containing information that they can use to move bitcoins to their address. This data packet is similar in a couple of ways to a check -- it has an "account number" on it (actually a bitcoin address), an amount for which you authorize payment, and a signature. They can cash this "check" (data packet) any time they like.


It makes a significant difference. If I hand my grocery store a check in return for bananas, a payment has occurred, but no money has (yet) been exchanged. If, instead of handing someone a check, I take that check and write down my account number and routing number and the authorized amount, and send that financial information over the internet to Amazon in return for bananas, then too a payment has occurred, but no money has (yet) been exchanged. The money changes hands when Amazon or my grocery store cashes the check (or data packet), accesses an authorized account (or bitcoin address), and moves money to their account (or bitcoin address).


Sure, just like where I send financial information over the internet and it is routed over multiple tcp/ip gateways.


No, because money isn't sent on any hop, not the first and not any others. A data packet is sent containing information which allows the recipient to move bitcoins to their address. And like with a check, the data transmitters who took that financial information from me and passed it to the merchant hop by hop over a data network didn't transmit money. They transmitted data packets.


It wasn't.

1/ Payment channels were indeed invented by Satoshi, and have worked since version 0.1 of the software (which was the first version). He put payment channels into the software precisely so that multiple parties could make off-chain payments and settle them later. As he described it, "Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast. Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network." You can read more details [here]( but it is clear that Satoshi wanted off-chain transactions to work. The lightning network simply hooks together a bunch of these payment channels, while implementing a fix to protect against the old vulnerability where someone in the channel could collude with a miner to broadcast a non-final version of the transaction. A way was discovered to fix that vulnerability, making LN transactions "trustless."
Also, LN transactions do "use" the blockchain. They use it for several things: for settlement, for holding money in a payment channel, and as a backup way to broadcast a transaction in case someone in your payment channels stops cooperating. When you use the LN, you are using the blockchain. You're using its security and its ability to hold funds.
2/ Funding a channel is putting your money in a multisignature address where you control that money. That's not a bad UX -- you already have to put your money in an address you control, the only difference is that this one is a multisig address. I doubt users will have to think about "how much do I want to put in my LN address" anymore than than think about "how much do I want to put in my normal address." It's the same process and can have the same interface. Plus, payment channels have all the same features and abilities of normal addresses, just with Extra features. Putting your money in a payment channel is a no-lose situation compared to putting it in a normal address.


You. By only downloading and using the software you want, you control what features you want to use and don't want to use. This is the consensus model; every party downloads the software they like best, and run it on the network they like best. If the majority switch to a new network or create new rules, you may switch with them if you like, or remain with the old rules on the old network.


It's not the only path. It's one optional solution to some problems. Other things developers are working on are MAST, Drivechain, Schnorr, and, after all that, a block size increase. All of these things will increase scalability.

The tldr is that the blockchain is no more secure than any other software, and its bugs allow hackers to hack your blockchain "accounts" and steal both your personal information and your money.
That's hogwash because the blockchain does not use accounts and does not know your personal information. To create an address on the blockchain all you need to do is come up with a random number with a sufficient number of digits and convince somebody to send bitcoins to that number. Your personal information never needs to come into play. The reason some bitcoin users's personal information has been stolen is not because of anything to do with the blockchain having bugs, it was because they gave that information to exchanges who stored it on ordinary data servers which were not secure from hackers.
The blockchain's security model is based on the premise that a random number of sufficient length (your "private key") will be statistically impossible to guess. If that's a "bug," then it's a bug shared by all modern cryptographic security systems, which all use the same security model.

1/ The lightning network is 100% sure. It uses the bitcoin blockchain to store your bitcoins, and it also uses it as a backup way to settle transactions in case someone you want to send money to doesn't want to use the lightning network, or in case someone gets disconnected from the lightning network while you're in the middle of a transaction. So it's as sure and secure as bitcoin itself, since it uses actual bitcoins  on the standard bitcoin blockchain.
2/ It is rolling out now, and you can download a testing wallet such as Zap Wallet (for the desktop) or Eclair (for mobile) right now if you want to test it. If you want to start using it on the real bitcoin blockchain, you have to change a number in the underlying code and then connect to another person or company on the network. (Torguard and Bitrefill are the two biggest nodes on the lightning network right now if you're looking for someone reliable to connect to.) Since the software has already been released for testing purposes, it's difficult to say "when" people will start using it -- they can start using it right now if they want, and the lightning network will grow in usage as more people start using it. But we can't force people to use it so there will be no "big moment." The network will grow naturally as more people and companies find out about it and start using it.
3/ The lightning network uses its own wallet protocol. You'll either have to download a lightning network wallet or else other wallet creators will have to update theirs to include the new protocol. There's no company in control though, the whole thing is open source and anyone can create a wallet from scratch if they know how to code.

The [recksplorer]( on desktop is beginning to take a long time to load. I imagine there are two reasons for this: the amount of data that it needs to process to load up the map is growing, and it appears to add to this by implementing a physics engine so that you can play with the map by dragging around nodes and then watching them drag other nodes with them or bounce back toward the network. But all this information is bloating the resources needed to load the map and it makes it take a long time to load, at least on my machine.
Is there a simpler map of the lightning network for the mainnet?

They are running LND, C-Lightning, and/or Eclair. But they've modified the source code a bit to get it to work on the mainnet. Apparently the easiest one to get running on the mainnet is c-lightning. After you've gotten it installed, you apparently just need to make one tiny change at startup. Instead of starting it with the command "lightningd/lightningd --network=testnet", start it with this command:
    lightningd/lightningd --network=bitcoin
You can say c-lightning is "over a year old" if you want, but its last commit was 12 hours ago. It's quite fresh.

None of those things are true though. Transaction fees are low, it doesn't have an inflationary basis, it is possible to mass adopt, there's no need to add more currency, new users can get paid with coins that already exist, and bitcoin works fine as a currency. Sounds like this guy is making things up.
Also, wallet creation is anonymous. There's no way to stop vendors from accepting money from an anonymous wallet. Therefore issuing people a wallet with ID info attached would do absolutely nothing. They could just send any money in that wallet to an anonymous wallet and go about their merry way.

Technically you can do it without paying anything. There is a [guide]( which recommends paying about $2.90 for 24 hours of storage service while you get a node set up, but if you read between the lines you'll see that you don't actually need to pay for a storage service if you run a pruned node on your cpu and just make sure it's aways online.

Knowing what I know now, I could tell him, "Within X years 25% of people will have phones, and then 3 years after that Y% of people will have phones," etc. But I don't have a crystal ball so I can't say how long it will be with lightning.

I think that all financial sectors will slowly get dominated by companies that use bitcoin, because of the fiscal advantages bitcoin offers. I mentally compare it to companies who don't have an internet presence -- they slowly get replaced by companies that do, or else they upgrade to the new, superior technology to stay relevant.


Their money continues to sink in value. They can trade fiat money for things of equal value -- but if it's government controlled and "printed" like fiat it won't be able to compete with bitcoin. Not in my thinking anyway.

It's software that lets you connect to the lightning network, which is a payment network built on bitcoin. Once you're connected, you can then make bitcoin payments without paying mining fees. The software is still in testing status, and is designed to be run on a test blockchain, not the actual bitcoin blockchain yet. But if you want to run it on the bitcoin blockchain anyway, you can run it with a special flag to use it with real money. Follow the instructions here:

If you run a full node and broadcast your transactions through that node, it stops others from removing you from the bitcoin network. I don't know if you were around when the 2x fork was happening, but a lot of wallet providers planned to switch their users off the bitcoin network and move them to the 2x network. Thankfully the fork was cancelled a couple of days before it was scheduled to occur, but if you run a bitcoin node you aren't subject to the whims of wallet providers. You control your own software, and you just use the features you want. If new features get added or a new network gets forked, you can download the new software if you want and/or set your node to recognize the new network, or remain with the old network. Simply put, running a full node gives you greater control over your bitcoins.

My 7 year old nephew gained access to a worldwide financial system the day he bought bitcoin earlier this year. Today he bought a board game online with his own money and no one asked how old he is. It will be shipped to his parents's house shortly. I helped him do it this time; but soon he won't need any help. I hope that he does this again and again until he's old enough to get a bank account. Then I'll just watch the look on his face when they try to explain what "3-5 business days" means, as well as why they need his social security number. Hopefully, at that point, he'll just stick with faithful, fast, private bitcoin.

I believe I was the first person you mentioned. I'm sorry that I gave you outdated information -- this is the first I've heard that they stopped using Dyjkstra's algorithm. Do you have a source? Googling Rusty Russel and Dyjkstra doesn't give me any relevant results. Did you find out what routing algorithm they actually use? I would love to know the corrected information.
OP, I believe HTLCs are a particular subset of bidirectional channels. Lightning channels as they exist now permit both parties to send each other funds, making them bidirectional. This process involves the use of preimages, which seems to match the description given on the Bitcoin Wiki for an HTLC. So I would say that is what the current implementations of the lightning network use. These channels are also called Poon-Dryja payment channels.

The author assumes that the only way to scale bitcoin up for mass adoption is with massive block sizes. But that is an inaccurate assumption, as the lightning network proves.
**Edit :: actually, nevermind. The author says toward the end that there are ways to scale up bitcoin without bloating the blockchain, and links to an article that discusses the lightning network. So good on the author for mentioning that -- except this paragraph is way down near the end of the article And it contradicts the headline. The headline says a mass-used bitcoin will end in centralization, but the concluding paragraphs say nevermind. That seems misleading.

Onchain fees will still be a thing because you need to do an onchain transaction every now and then to open and close channels. Get a few million people opening/closing a channel "every now and then" and the result is that there are constantly at least *some* onchain transactions. Miners can get paid from those.

You don't have to trade on an exchange. You can trade bitcoins anonymously using services such as localbitcoins. Also, you can launder stolen bitcoins for clean altcoins using a service like changelly or shapeshift, which don't require identity verification, and then you can get those clean altcoins turned back into bitcoins -- but new ones -- and sell those without anyone knowing what you did. Using methods such as these -- and things like not selling all at once but doing it in small batches over a long term -- can result in purely anonymous bitcoin sales.

There are not yet any simple guides. Part of that is because the most advanced lightning software is still in beta and is intended for testing only, and not ready (in the eyes of its developers) for the actual bitcoin blockchain.

The headline means there was a sudden massive increase in the number of transactions offering miners high fees. As a result, our low fee holiday is over -- probably until next weekend.
The picture represents this unusual fee behavior using pretty colors. The different colored horizontal stripes each represent a certain number of transactions at a particular fee level. The bottom stripe represents transactions with a fee of 0-5 satoshis per byte -- these are unlikely to get processed anytime soon. The next stripe up represents transactions with a fee of 5-10 satoshis per byte, and so forth. The picture shifts slightly to the left whenever a new block is found -- thus, the further to the right you look in the picture, the more up to date information you'll see.
There are also spikey thingies within the stripes that look kind of like waves. The downward part of each wave means a new block was found and a lot of the transactions in that stripe got put into blockchain, which removes them from this picture. The upward part of each wave means more transactions were broadcast and are waiting to get mined.
I think that's roughly everything in the picture. Does that help?

LN transactions are faster and cheaper than standard transactions, and the bitcoins in the channel actually enter your control, in an address controlled by you. You have possession of the private keys, and no one can spend them without your consent. But if you take them out of the channel, all you're doing is sending them to yet another address in your control, only you lose the first two of those features, speed and cheapness. So why do it? Why close the channel?

$10 is over 10 times too high a fee. Transactions are clearing right now for 8 or 9 satoshis per byte: 
Multiply that by 226 bytes for a standard 1-input-2-output transaction and you get 2034 satoshis as a total fee -- i.e. $0.22 at current prices, and that's if you don't even use the segwit discount.
And if you still don't believe me check any the latest blocks, such as  The transactions at the bottom are paying 9-10 satoshis per byte.
Also, yes, miners can stay profitable off just fees only at any price above $0. The difficulty adjusts so that the average miner doesn't have to pay more electricity than the block reward is worth.

You can see how much money is in any channel by checking the standard bitcoin blockchain. Lightning channels are addresses on the bitcoin blockchain, and you can check the balance of anyone's address on the blockchain. What you can't see by that method is how much money belongs to each party in that channel -- that information is kept private.

If you plan to gradually spend $200 on the lightning network you'll need to get at least $200 into one or more LN payment channels. You do not *need* to do this via one single on-chain transaction. You can use multiple on-chain transactions to get that amount into your channel(s), or, if you are connected to a payment channel where your counterparty has $200+ in it, you could receive that $200 via a LN transaction (for example, it might come through an exchange). Once you've got it, you can make your payments as often as you like to the coffee shop (or to anyone else on the network).
If you allow your friends to use you as a route to the coffee shop, they can use up your channel in that direction. Three things should be mentioned, though: first, if you're acting as a route To the coffee shop, you're likely to also be a route From the coffee shop, which would restore your liquidity. Second, if for some reason you know you won't be used as a "from" route, you can just turn off routing in order to preserve your liquidity for your use only. And thirdly, it is unlikely that you'll only have one route to your coffee shop. You'll likely have several routes to the coffee shop via other channels with other entities. So if your liquidity in one route dries up -- and if it hasn't been restored via the coffee shop's transactions through you to other people -- then you can likely get to the coffee shop anyway through another channel.

1/ I've never heard of this CGN problem, perhaps because this is the first time I've run a network node and had to look up stuff like this. After googling "Carrier Grade NAT incoming connections" for more info, I found [an article]( which explains how to enable incoming connections if you have a CGN.
2/ Routing payments for other people is optional. If you can't keep a node up 24/7, just turn routing off and online clients won't see you except when you connect with them to send a payment.
3/ First, no one is required to connect to a large node. If there is a large node somewhere and the gov tells them 
to stop accepting anonymous channels, people who want privacy can just connect to someone else. The same goes for onion routing: if the gov tells a large node to stop using onion routes, people who want onion routes can just use someone else. Large nodes are optional.
BTW the last point always reminds me of Walmart. Walmart is a large supermarket -- analogous to a large node. But if someone said the grocery industry "doesn't work" because it's become centralized around Walmart, I would remind them that shopping at Walmart is optional. Walmart (i.e. large nodes) should exist for people who want to use them -- but you don't have to, you can go to Trader Joe's (i.e. a small node) or wherever you want instead.

That attack can't work because you need the other party to sign each new transaction. You can't keep one to yourself and have it be valid. Payment channels are multisignature addresses, which means they require both parties to sign any transactions moving money from that address before they can be mined or even transmitted by the network to the miners. The transaction you keep to yourself would be invalid, the network wouldn't accept it, and thus you could not use it to try to steal the money in the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:45:11
No, you don't need to prove the old contract is old. The old contract is not minable until it's relative timelock expires; the new contract has a timelock that expires sooner. As long as you broadcast the newer contract before the old one's timelock expires, and pay a sufficient miner fee, yours will get mined first, because it is minable first and miners want that sweet, sweet fee money.

Yeah, there are other things like bitpay. Other debit card providers include [Xapo]( and [Shift]( But there's another service I think you'd find even more fascinating -- [purse.io]( They are a partner with Amazon. If you purchase Amazon stuff through their website, Amazon will fulfill the order, but you can use bitcoins to pay for whatever you bought. Purse will then pay Amazon the equivalent dollars for whatever it is and put your address through to Amazon as the shipping address.
They also have a related service that you can use to buy bitcoins without giving anyone your financial info. How that works is, Amazon customers can sign up to get notifications from purse.io that someone is offering X number of bitcoins to buy an Amazon product. Whatever customer buys that product with dollars, purse.io will send him or her the bitcoins, though purse.io keeps back some of it for their own profits. This allows people to buy bitcoins who have an Amazon account but don't want to sign up at an exchange where you have to hand over your financial info. Plus, it works out really well for buyers who are paying with bitcoins: sometimes your order will be fulfilled by someone who has Amazon Prime, and you get the benefit of 2-day shipping without actually paying for that.

No, you don't have to have the penalty key. You may just broadcast the latest signed transaction, though I suppose it's true you would not get any penalty funds by this method. If your counterparty has already spent all the money in his channel, though, you wouldn't get any penalty funds anyway. I believe your main premise is that it's only potentially worthwhile to try fraudulence if your half of the channel is empty. (And I would still question that, since even then you have to risk a mining fee with almost certainly no benefit. The code to catch fraudulence is very simple and can be run anywhere -- on a cloud service, on a friend's computer, even on a smart contract platform. It literally takes like 5 lines of code to catch a fraudulent transaction.)

My recommendation is to get an IRC client, login to Freenode, find a time when the  channel is active (or the  channel), and ask the folks in there. I haven't done it myself, but from what I've heard switching from testnet to mainnet involves a very simple change of one variable in a file in the source code of the testnet version, and then you also have to find a mainnet channel partner to connect to. (Bitrefill, Torguard, and Blockstream are the three most popular channel partners on the mainnet right now.)

Yes, all of them except the last one. Trust: I don't trust Visa as much as I'd like to because I've had my card declined sometimes. Plus, you can't be sure Visa will always work with a merchant you want to work with. Any merchant can create a bitcoin address because bitcoin doesn't care who your customers are; not every merchant can create a Visa account because Visa wants to know who your customers are and block some of them. Security: my Visa identity has been stolen due to compromised swipe thingies. My private key cannot be stolen by such a device because it never sees my private key. Efficiency: (and the author includes transaction cost in here for some reason) I was upcharged by a gas station once because I wanted to use visa instead of cash. They used a visa upcharge in part because visa charges them fees. High network up-times: I've never personally not had a transaction go through because Visa's systems were down, but it has happened to other people. It hasn't happened on bitcoin though.


As proof of this they show a chart that says Visa's transaction fees are "only" about 6 cents per transaction. That's not "more efficient" than bitcoin. They also show that card fraud is up to 12% in the USA and over 5% in the rest of the world. That's not "more secure" than bitcoin. The charts don't agree with their conclusion.


But bitcoin does give those things, via multisig addresses. If you and your merchant use multisig addresses, you can have a third party escrow service offer you cash back protection and an option for redress: if you can prove fraud, you and the third party can refund you your money using your private keys. But bitcoin also offers nonrefundable transactions -- which Visa doesn't. So it's better that way as well, because it gives you more options. If you want money back protection, buy from a merchant who is willing to use an escrow service. And then just let the market do its work. May the companies who offer the best customer experience win.


Those transactions go into pending status and then confirm several days later, if the money is still in the bank account. Bitcoin is much quicker -- transactions go into pending status at the same speed as Visa/Mastercard and confirm in minutes to hours, if the money is still in the spending address.


Complaining about beta software is what's disappointing. It would be stupid to use the original beta versions of Visa and Mastercard and then declare that anyone who looks to Visa and Mastercard will be disappointed.


Centralization is when one person or group controls an activity. Routing partners cannot control your payment activity. Therefore they are not centralized. Even if everyone connects to just a few routing partners, those routing partners still cannot control what you do with your money. No control = no centralization.

It's called "they control all the money you put in their service, and they can block your payments or freeze your account if they don't like what you're doing." Also, Paypal stores all your money in your home country's currency, where its value is deflated according to whatever monetary policy your government is following at any given moment. Bitcoin doesn't have this flaw either.

Thank you, a lot of that was stuff I didn't know. I was already aware that transaction replacement is do-able without a protocol change, including in bcash, but when I try to mentally figure out how it can be done the method I initially think of has a problem. If I describe it briefly to you, would you please correct me? In my imagination you can replace a low-fee transaction in bcash (or in bitcoin) by simply signing and broadcasting a new one from the same address and with a higher fee, and making none of the change return to the originating address. If that second transaction gets confirmed first, then you've successfully replaced the transaction. But the problem I see involves the following assumption: don't bcash nodes cast out a transaction from address XYZ if they've already got one in their mempool from address XYZ? If they do, wouldn't that prevent RBF transactions from happening? Thanks for the insight.

Centralization is when one person or group controls an activity. Routing partners cannot control your payment activity. Therefore the lightning network cannot be centralized. No control = no centralization.
Also, the blocksize limit is mandatory. You cannot share a block with a standard bitcoin node if it exceeds the blocksize limit.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:18:56
Lightning network apps use real bitcoins on the standard bitcoin blockchain. They store the bitcoins on the same blockchain everyone else uses, and in case of any problems on the lightning network they use the blockchain as a backup way to process payments. Except when they're using this backup method, lightning network apps have their own way to process payments, one that doesn't use miners or 10 minute blocks. Thus, you don't ordinarily need to pay mining fees or wait 10 minutes for a confirmation. As long as your recipient accepts lightning network payments, he gets real bitcoins on the real bitcoin network backed by the same secure blockchain that everyone else uses, but they arrive instantly instead of waiting for 10 minute confirmations, and they do not involve mining fees, so the transactions are nearly free.

A few places have bitcoin gadgets alongside traditional payment processors. That's where we're at now. If bitcoin continues to offer superior performance to these other payment processors, I think more and more merchants will begin accepting it. If that happens, I think a few merchants will start relying on bitcoin payments exclusively. And if these merchants do better than their competitors, then, perhaps, we've really arrived at bitcoin's mass adoption.

I'm not gonna pretend you're 5, but here you go.
A block full of segwit transactions alone can be almost 4 mbs. Unupgraded nodes see these blocks as valid, but they don't see the signature data, because segwit transactions prune that data when sharing it with unupgraded nodes. As a consequence, unupgraded nodes see segwit transactions as if they didn't have signature data, which makes them look like they have a significantly smaller number of bytes. A 3.99 mb block with segwit-only transactions would still appear to be less than 1 mb to an unupgraded node.

I use a bitcoin-backed debit card for my purchases. Technically, that means I am only indirectly paying for stuff with bitcoins. Every purchase I make using this card is first backed by sending bitcoins to the company who sent me the card, and then they give me the equivalent amount of USD so that I can complete the purchase. This method has its drawbacks -- I am still relying on Visa, for example -- but on the other hand it's not hard to find vendors who accept a Visa debit card so I like it. By means of this method I suppose I make most of my purchases with bitcoin -- but only indirectly, by funding this card.

If that's true, then lightning nodes are covered, because they are data carriers, not money transmitters.


Lightning nodes do not transmit value. They transmit data packets that allow the receipient to move bitcoins on the blockchain at his own discretion. They also do not have an obligation to transmit these packets. At any moment before they transmit the data they can decide not to do it and turn off their node. If they want, they can take n_O's transaction information, look it over, decide they don't want to transmit it, and tell him to get lost. At no point are they under any kind of obligation to transmit that information to the third party.


You can convince me very easily: name one thing a LN node transmits other than transaction information. Good luck.


Because an honest evaluation of the system is that bitcoins never touch lightning nodes. Lightning nodes are off-chain. Bitcoins are on-chain. Bitcoins are never off the blockchain; lightning nodes are never on the blockchain. It is literally impossible for a lightning node to receive bitcoins or send them. Lightning nodes only have access to transaction information. Users put this information into data packets and send them through lightning nodes just like tcp/ip gateways. These nodes never transmit any money. Therefore they are not money transmitters.

Mining fees can't "still" be $20-30 when they aren't $20-30 right now. Mining fees cost less than 10 satoshis per byte right now, which, at the current price, makes an average transaction cost less than $0.34.  Not 34 dollars -- 34 cents.
Mining fees could stay as low as they are right now forever and they would still be enough for miners to keep mining even if the block reward was totally removed. If some miners don't make enough to pay their bills, they will stop, and the difficulty will go down. If it's still not profitable for some miners, it will go down again as more and more drop off, until it reaches equilibrium. Thus mining will always be profitable for some miners, regardless of coin price (with a single exception: if the coin price reaches $0.00, mining cannot theoretically be profitable).
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:07:40


They do not receive and transmit value. They receive and transmit data packets, specifically containing transaction information which can be used by the recipient to move bitcoins with the blockchain. If that information gets broadcast, the blockchain processes the payment, not the lightning node. If it does not get broadcast, data packets are the only things that got transmitted, not bitcoins.
Your example proves that the intermediary did not transmit money from n_O to n_R. In your example, n_O didn't even send any bitcoins to anyone. He sent transaction information to n_I the same way every bitcoiner does with their internet service providers whenever a bitcoin transaction is broadcast over the internet. But n_I lost that information, and in his catastrophic failure he also lost bitcoins and probably cried a little. None of that makes him a money transmitter. He did not process a payment and he did not receive and transmit bitcoins. He passed along information to n_R about how to use the blockchain as a payment processor to move bitcoins to n_R's address. Your ISP does the same thing when you broadcast a transaction. That doesn't make them a money transmitter, and doing the same thing as a tcp/ip gateway doesn't make n_I a money transmitter.

Your premises lead logically to at least one of your conclusions, which is good. I commend you for logical thinking on at least one point. My main problem with your post is that I disagree with your premise that bitcoin has no utility. If I agreed that bitcoin has no utility, I would agree that its value is dependent on speculation. I also agree that utility is essential. I think bitcoin has utility in many ways: its method of processing payments has utility, its support for contractual payments has utility, its ability to store information has utility, its privacy has utility, its miners have utility, and its proof of work has utility.
Apart from that, I also want to note three things: first, if by "P2P" you mean "peer to peer," bitcoin has that. Second, I think all assets, as well as all stocks, and all national currencies, as well as bitcoin, suffer from a common problem: sellers and shorters can lower the value of any asset, stock, or currency, simply by selling it for less than the spot price. But nonetheless I don't think it's fair to say that investors won't or shouldn't invest in an asset that this can happen to. (Not claiming that that's your position btw.) Even though third parties can lower the value of bitcoin by selling it, there is a very common reason why risk-averse institutions might invest, and it's the same reason they invest in other things that this can happen to: if their confidence that the price will go up outweighs their fear of the risk that it will go down, they will invest.
Third, I think bitcoin has intrinsic value which comes from its proof of work. I am confident you disagree with me. I also think it trades at a value that is currently higher than its intrinsic value by a relatively large margin. It's difficult to go further down this train of thought because I am confident you disagree with my starting assumption. But since I think bitcoin has intrinsic value, I also think this intrinsic value helps support the higher value it trades at, the value which speculators give it. (It provides a floor.)

An imaginary conversation between the government and a lightning node operator.
Government: If you run a lightning node, you have to have a money transmitter license. 
Bitcoiners: Okay, but can we do tcp/ip without a money transmitter license? 
G: Sure.
B: Oh, well then we'll just use that.
G: No! You can't send financial information on a peer to peer network. 
B: Then how are we supposed to pay for stuff on Amazon? Our credit card information or whatever gets sent over a peer to peer network.
G: Well, as long as you're just transmitting that kind of data, you don't need a license.
And then we'll do that. We can send bitcoin data via the lightning specification using whatever kind of unlicensed communication methods the government permits. As a result, there is literally no way to require lightning nodes to get a license as long as the government allows any sort of unlicensed communication over the internet. The lightning specification can be adapted to work using any form of communication for which you don't need a license. All you are doing is transmitting data -- we can transmit that data in any form of unlicensed communication available. Unless they require you to have a license for speaking, they cannot require you to have a license for bitcoining.

Yes, I see that and I've downloaded the app myself. I am very impressed with Square. I wonder how they estimate the fee to charge for withdrawals? I imagine they overpay significantly like other wallets -- and the description doesn't mention anything about selecting a custom fee, which makes sense 'cuz bad UI and stuff. The addition of withdrawal options makes the Cash app insanely cool. It's the new easiest method to buy bitcoins and send them to others. Now all Square needs to do is to let you deposit bitcoins from an external wallet, let you hold your own private keys, add something like an "advanced options" button to let you set a custom fee, and integrate bitcoin payments into the Square card reader.

You're welcome. :)


No, segwit did several things, one of which was, it replaced the old blocksize limit with something bigger. The new blocksize limit is just under 4 mb. Segwit doesn't compress anything. The only thing close to compression it does is this: when a new, segwit-supporting node transmits a block with segwit transactions to an old, unupgraded node, the new node prunes away some of the witness data in that block so that the old node receives a block that is still under 1 mb.
Segwit does this to keep the old, unupgraded nodes happy, because if the old nodes received blocks from the new nodes that were bigger than 1 mb, the old nodes would reject those blocks and it would create a network split. To prevent this from happening, segwit nodes just prune away some of the data when sharing a block with the old nodes. They don't compress the blocks -- they prune the witness data out of the blocks depending on who they're sharing a block with, an old node or a new node. Among new nodes they share the full, greater-than-1-megabyte block of data.


Most of us are.


I think so. If the majority actively wants anything different they can easily start using software that reflects their active opinion better.


I'm sure some people are being passive about it. And I will add that, in my opinion, passivity is complicity. But that's just my opinion. It's really hard for me to accept a complaint about the status quo from someone who is voluntarily using software that maintains the status quo. There are plenty of wallets available that are set up to allow bigger blocks. If you don't know how to change this setting yourself, download one of those.
While we're on the topic of voting, it is important to point out the difference between the consensus model bitcoin uses and the democratic model some people confuse it with. The consensus model is where you run the software you want and connect to the network you want. As more people do that, the network you are on grows, the software you like gets more usage, and, in the case of digital currency, the increase in usage typically reflects an increase in price. If other people don't want to run the software you like, or don't want to connect to the network you are on, or don't want to use the currency you use, they are free to do something different. This can indeed result in a loss in value, if people switch over from your preferred network and/or currency to a different one. If you want to, you can switch too. Consensus is the model where everyone may join whatever network they prefer -- the biggest one tends to have the highest aggregate value.
This is very different from a democratic model, where a majority of people may vote to impose changes on a minority. Bitcoin does not work that way because it is designed to make impositions impossible. No one can change the software you run without your consent -- not even a majority. Even if the majority of people change their wallets, change the network they connect to, and change digital currencies, you remain in complete control of what software you run, what network you connect to, and what currency you decide to use. You can't impose your preferences about this issue onto anyone else. If the majority changes, you may change with the majority if you wish, or stay behind with the minority and continue using a coin whose value has collapsed. If a minority changes, you may stay with your still very valuable coin if you wish, or you may leave too and hope for something better. The consensus model is almost a complete free for all compared to the democratic model, and that has its advantages.
I hope that helps.


I support a hard fork provisionally, that is, if two things happen first. If several improvements are ready to be put in place at the same time, using the big bang upgrade model, and if we have reached the capacity of the current blocksize, then I will download a wallet (or an upgrade to my node) that accepts a hardfork, including larger blocks. But not til then. If you want to do one sooner, or if you don't like the big bang upgrade model, do what you like. You do you. I recommend downloading some node software that says you're ready for a hardfork now. But I don't think it's wise to complain about the status quo of this network when you're voluntarily using software that maintains the status quo of this network. And I will add that if you really just want bigger blocks, bcash's price is doing quite well, they're like the 4th biggest altcoin, so give their coin a try if you like the model it uses.

Only if you so choose. It is important to remind people that large routing partners are (1) optional and (2) unable to censor transactions and (3) unable to know the source or destination of a payment. This is why centralization is impossible on the lightning network. Even in the "worst case" scenario where everyone connects directly or indirectly to an enormous routing partner, that routing partner still cannot identify or censor your payment activity. Centralization is when one person or group controls an activity. On the lightning network, routing partners cannot control your payment activity. Therefore there can be no centralization on the lightning network.

The second instruction in the link says "launch bitcoind 0.15.1 and sync it." Bitcoind is bitcoin node software that runs on a command line without a graphical user interface. To connect to the lightning network requires a bitcoin node to run somewhere -- or at least a light client. You need a bitcoin node to use the lightning network for several functions: you have to send bitcoins to your payment channel, you have to monitor the blockchain in case your channel partner tries to broadcast an old transaction, and if that happens you also have to use the blockchain to broadcast the most recent transaction. Most lightning software implementations use bitcoind because the user will likely be using a graphical user interface based on lightning rather than the standard bitcoin node user interface. Since bitcoind runs on a command line, which lightning software can access, your lightning node can give the appropriate commands for all the functions it needs to run.
That's a long answer, but the short answer is that you do need to run a bitcoin node and the second instruction in the link I gave you says to launch node software before you start doing the lightning stuff.

I don't believe a lightning network transaction is larger than a standard transaction, but as I mentioned in my other reply to this thread the fee structure is different. It isn't calculated per byte nor does it involve paying for space in the next block. It involves paying a chain of routing partners in a network from you to the guy you're ultimately paying. I'm not sure how many hops that transaction made or how much each routing partner charged in fees, but ultimately the total amount he paid was 540 satoshis, which is significantly better than what he would have paid for an on-chain transaction.

If that routing partner can't route your funds his node will be unable to forward your transaction information to the next node. Your node can only return routes that actually reach your destination, because only those routes can provide you valid info from the recipient. If one route doesn't get you the info you need to complete your transaction, your node can try another route.

Not very. It's a pretty simple program available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Go to bitcoin.org and get yourself a copy, ask around if you have any other questions. If you don't have a lot of storage you'll probably have to set it to prune the blockchain so it fits on your computer.

Thank you. It sounds like my assumption is false: bcash nodes apparently do Not ignore replacement transactions. They broadcast them all the same. Thank you.

1/ Yes. If you don't have a path to Bob that can fit 1 whole btc, but you have 2 paths which can each accept .5 btc, ask him if it's okay if you send two transactions, each for .5 btcs. It's like asking a store owner if he'll accept two $50 checks to pay for one $100 item. It's up to the store owner whether he'll accept that, nothing in the software needs to change to allow that.
2/ It is possible. Payment channels are normal multisignature addresses on the blockchain, and addresses are reusable. Bear in mind that sending money to an old address opens your channel to a quantum attack if someone ever develops a quantum computer. It's not recommended. Also, reusing a channel costs the same miner fee as creating a new one. You're not saving anything by reusing a payment channel. Moreover, there's a simple button in the software to create a new channel with Bob, whereas there is no button for reusing an address. You'd have to do a custom transaction, which is difficult, and there's no reason to do it. Just create a new channel -- it takes one click.
3/ It is stored on your lightning node and on Bob's. You can also store a copy anywhere you like -- on dropbox, on a usb, or whatever. We plan for there to eventually be watchtower services you can store them on as well in case you need to go offline. A watchtower service can monitor the blockchain for you in case Bob tries to broadcast an outdated transaction (i.e. a fraudulent one), and it can broadcast the latest transaction you've given it if Bob broadcasts any transaction that doesn't match the latest one.

I won't tell you what to do, but to me, asking for changes to the fincen regulation seems pointless. Tcp/ip gateways didn't need to get fincen exceptions when they started transmitting transaction information, and lightning nodes do literally the same thing they do. Telling people "but they're probably going to fine you so you'd better prepare" is just fud. It's totally legal to transmit data packets without a license, even at an enormous scale. Also, as someone who runs a full bitcoin node, I already verify and transmit transaction information via the mempool. So does every other node operator. No license needed. Bitcoin transactions are just data packets, they are not money. The money is on the blockchain.

Depends on many unpredictable factors. Do you send it via the lightning network? What fees are charged by the route you use? Do you send it on the blockchain? What is the block size at that point?

Bcash will become more centralized over time and lightning won't.
In bcash you can't control who mines your payment. In lightning, you can control who routes your payment.
Bcash also keeps on updating the hardware and bandwidth requirements. The lightning network does not require advanced hardware at all, in fact you can run it in a raspberry pi.
So for two reasons the lightning network will remain decentralized: you can choose your routing partners and there are low hardware/bandwidth requirements.
I will say this: it sucks that in order to receive payments on the lightning network trustlessly you have to either remain online or use an always-online third party watchtower service. Thankfully, the code to be a watchtower is so simple you can code it up as a browser extension, app, or as cloud-ready software for a service like Google's App Engine, and you can even run a common watchtower program by agreement on your friends's computers.

Nope. Putting bitcoins in a channel puts them in an address to which you have private keys. You can remove them any time. They're not "locked up" any more than they are in any other address. Moreover, you can spend them on the LN without even removing them from the address. So they're doubly not locked up.


True. With one possible exception: if you're the one receiving money, you can open a channel without spending anything. The person sending you the money can fund the channel and send you the money through it.


No. Putting btcs in a channel is putting them in an address to which you have private keys. No one can take them without your consent, no one can move them without your private keys, no one can discover your private keys unless you let them have them. Your bitcoins are as safe in a payment channel as they are in any other bitcoin address, because a payment channel is a bitcoin address.


Because payments made on the LN are cheaper, faster, and more private than standard bitcoin payments.

The blocksize isn't at 1MB anymore. Only like 25 blocks per day are less than 1MB anymore. The last time we raised the blocksize limit was in August when we pushed Segwit through, and at that time we raised it to a maximum of just under 4 mb. The [largest block we've had since then]( was 2.2 mb -- and there have only been a few blocks that were even close to that size since segwit went through. We're not using our full capacity yet with the latest blocksize increase, and I don't think it's time yet to do another one. But please don't read this post as if I think my opinion is the same as fact. You hold a different opinion than me -- great. One thing you can do to make your opinion more effective in the real world is to run a full node and set it so that it's ready for larger blocks. Bigger blocks will come rolling steadily in as the number of big-block-ready full-node wallets grows, because that's how consensus works. You can contribute -- run a node that reflects your opinion and tell others why you're doing it. Encourage them to do the same.


I don't think that's true in cases like bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't do automatic upgrades. In a system as user-controlled as bitcoin is, I think people's typical behavior is that they'll only upgrade if something breaks. A lot of people think "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," right? And a lot of people practice the "Set it and forget it" model when it comes to point-of-sale systems. If we put out continuous hard forks people can't do that -- they have to constantly upgrade because there is no auto-update function, and that's because bitcoin's developers don't want to create a central point of control or a central point of failure. You can't blame core for a bad piece of code if you were in charge of deciding whether or not to use it, at what time, and after how much testing. Since bitcoin doesn't do auto-updating, I think the big bang approach makes much more sense. Whenever we get around to doing a hard fork we're gonna break a bunch of unupgraded systems. Let's try to make that rare. Big bang all the way.

They guys at the airport just hand me over to a jury. And if someone tries to tell a jury that I've transmitted money, I'll show them that my node is an ordinary data transmitter and never touches money. The government can't make the lightning network illegal without making it illegal to transmit data, because that's all a lightning node does. To permit the internet is to permit lightning nodes, because a lightning node doesn't do anything different than ordinary internet data transmitters do.

Yes, it is useful, but the reason the devs haven't announced that it's ready for mainnet is because (1) it's not and (2) they don't want to be overwhelmed with support questions while people break things or find that it's not working on their machine. People get all sorts of expectations that the devs should help them instead of working on the code, and they tend to flood the public forum like IRC with support questions. The devs then have to leave that forum in order to find somewhere where they can collaborate. If they close it to the public, they lose valuable feedback. If they open it, they get flooded with support questions. That's why they want to wait until their products are ready before announcing how to get them running.

That is not a better analogy because bank G receives and transmits money, whereas lightning nodes never receive money and never transmit money. They only receive and transmit data packets containing information about how to move bitcoins on the blockchain. Since they are only transmitting data, and not money, they are a data carrier and not a money transmitter. Lightning nodes are like the internet providers that banks use to send each other financial information, or the fax machines, or the phone lines. Those services are like lightning nodes because they don't receive or transmit money -- just data.

If you are in an economic minority position where most people changed to a new protocol incompatible with the old one, and you continued to use the old one, your coins would lose value.

Their coins will default to whomever they are designated. If an employer or some other entity creates a payment channel on your behalf, they may fund that channel with coins which -- by default -- get sent to an address in your control if the channel closes. Subsequently, you may use your private keys to cause some other behavior, like paying someone else, or sending a bit of money back to the entity which gave you the funding money. But at that point it's up to you. The money defaults to whoever is designated as the recipient -- the channel funder can designate you as the recipient, or themselves as the recipient. If they designate themselves as the recipient, then they aren't really "your" bitcoins.

Lightning network nodes do not transmit money. The actual bitcoins are transmitted peer-to-peer, from one wallet to another, at the time of settlement. The lightning network provides the recipient with information so that the recipient can reliably withdraw funds from the sender peer-to-peer. If I provide you with my bank account info via text message, or mail, or telegram, the carrier of the message doesn't need to open a money transmitter license, and neither does a LN node. The carrier of transaction information does not transmit the money -- that happens peer-to-peer, wallet-to-wallet, at the time of settlement.
LN nodes do not transmit bitcoins. What about the other criteria in the fincen law? Well, it says that it applies to entities which create bitcoins, distribute bitcoins, or exchange bitcoins. But LN nodes don't do any of those things either. Miners create bitcoins; exchanges exchange bitcoins; and distribution of bitcoins happens peer-to-peer. 
"Obtaining" bitcoins and "accepting" bitcoins are the only regulated activities the government could try to pin on node operators, but these, too, fail to stick, because of the conditions laid out in the fincen law.
It is not *everyone* who is regulated for obtaining and accepting bitcoins -- normal users do that all the time and are specifically exempted under the clause "A user of virtual currency is not an MSB under fincen's regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations."
The type of person who must report and keep records under the fincen law is specifically identified: "An administrator or exchanger." And it defines those terms: "An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency." Not a node operator -- their business is transmitting information from peer to peer so that those peers can find each other's wallets easily and so that one party can withdraw money from the other reliably. 
LN node operators are also not an administrator: "An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency." This, too, is not what LN node operators do. Node operators transmit wallet information and unbroadcasted transaction information, they do not not transmit bitcoins nor issue bitcoins nor redeem bitcoins as a business model.
TL;DR LN node operators don't have to apply for a money transmitter license. LN nodes may accept and obtain bitcoins for the service they provide just as any other bitcoin-accepting business may do, and don't have to obtain a money transmitter license to do so. Every individual may do this and no one is required to apply for a money transmitter license merely for obtaining and accepting bitcoins.
So there you go. What LN node operators do does not fall under any of the reporting requirements of the fincen law, and therefore you can safely run a LN node without worrying that you suddenly count as a bank.

They could belong to a holding company which has outlasted its founder, or to an inheritance which is locked up until X generations.

It is possible for anyone to add funds to a lightning network payment channel, but there are significant difficulties involved which would need to be overcome for the example you provided. The primary difficulty involves how to take the money out of the channel. Payment channels are designed so that when money comes in, it has a script in the transaction metadata which automatically sends the money back to the sender if the channel closes. Then, before it closes, the participants in the channel may both use their signatures to resign the transaction (or rather sign a new one) inside the channel with this change: instead of sending the whole amount back to the sender, send a portion to the counterparty and the change back to the sender. This can be repeated until either party closes the channel.
The problem is that money sent from an exchange does not currently have payment channel scripts in the metadata. If an exchange puts money into your payment channel without using Script to assign that money to you once the payment channel closes, it will remain in that payment channel permanently, unless you and your counterparty both sign a transaction agreeing on what to do with that money.
This difficulty could be easily overcome if an exchange enables support for withdrawing to a payment channel, and lets you set up that withdrawal to use Script and assign the money to go to one of your other addresses by default in the event that the channel closes. If you did that (or if the exchange did), then you could treat it like any other source of funding in your payment channel.

It's not true for every Segwit address. There are two methods of creating a Segwit address: bech32 and PTSH, which stands for "pay to script hash." Ptsh Segwit addresses start with a 3 instead of starting with bech32, and most wallets/exchanges recognize them as just a normal address with a fancy script attached.

I think I edited out the part where I got your point. But I'm coming around slowly.


Or maybe you're the one coming around.


I think there was a direct connection in one sense and an indirect connection in another. Directly, an exchange was made in which Anne and Bob each gave up ownership of one thing (Anne to Bob and Bob to Anne) and acquired ownership of something else. Do you agree with that?
Also, in your example, let's have Carol go offline Before Bob completes his contract with her instead of after. He can still complete the contract -- therefore Carol is no longer a party to the transaction once the contract has been prepared. At least that's what I think. What do you think?
Also also...look what I just found:
"The term 'money transmitter' shall not include a person that only:
(A) Provides the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services;
(B) Acts as a payment processor to facilitate the purchase of, or payment of a bill for, a good or service through a clearance and settlement system by agreement with the creditor or seller."

Yes, you can transfer bitcoins from any wallet to your bitpay card. You don't have to use a Bitpay wallet. I've used three different wallets to send money to my Bitpay card: Mycelium, Greenbits, and Gdax. To put money on this card costs whatever amount you send (obviously, because that's what you're putting on the card), plus a transaction fee that your wallet will charge, and an additional "network cost" which Bitpay charges for some reason. The "network cost" appears to be the same price as a higher-than-average transaction fee, making it seem like you are paying a transaction fee twice whenever you fund your card. Which sort of sucks, but it usually isn't too bad. Right now it's bad, though -- the "network cost" is 0.000612 btc, which is $9.87. Terrible.

Millions of dollars are worth making a backup.
2. I like Paypal and I think they are a very valuable company, but Paypal isn't as secure as bitcoin, nor is it as private. And here's the really big thing with paypal: your money isn't in your control when it's on their servers. Search google for "paypal account freeze" (without quotes) for a few examples of some of the most egregious things they do. When Paypal adjudicates transaction disputes, they do the best they can, but sometimes their decisions don't always favor the person who was in the right. Moreover, large transactions on paypal take longer than they do with bitcoin. (Search for "large transaction delay paypal" -- without quotes -- for examples.) And paypal also only works with fiat currencies, which are designed to decrease in value at an inflation rate of 2% per year (in the U.S.). Bitcoin is better than paypal, imo, because it beats Paypal on all these areas.
That said, I have a Paypal account and I've used them for many things when I couldn't use a debit card. They are a very convenient service for what they offer and if I didn't have bitcoin I would likely use Paypal more often than I do. Paypal is great -- but bitcoin has features that, imo, outclass what Paypal can do.

No, only the private key holder knows what script they used to produce their 3 style address. As Andreas puts it in the book Mastering Bitcoin, "the person making a payment does not see the script." The introduction of p2sh addresses was a massive privacy boost for bitcoin, because before that, you had to share your script with the person who was paying you before they could execute that script as part of payment. Now you no longer have to, because of p2sh addresses.
It is true that they are *most commonly* used for segwit scripts and multisig scripts, but technically they can mask *any* script.

Hang on a second, the exemption states that it applies to a "person that...acts as" a payment processor, not that it applies to payment processing companies. Payment processing companies are not exempt from fincen regulations. But persons who act as a payment processor through a clearance and settling system are sometimes exempt -- and that's what Carol is doing. Also, as a counter-example to your highlighted line, Square is a payment processor but they don't "only" settle payments for BSA regulated financial institutions. I used to have one of those credit card reader things and I was able to connect it to my bank account just fine without being a BSA regulated financial institution. I think that regulation is just saying that if you "only" admit BSA-regulated financial institutions, then you are exempt from following Bank Secrecy Act regulations, presumably because the organizations you are processing payments for all already follow those regulations. It doesn't say those are the only organizations a payment processor may process payments for. Good golly, Square could never get into Jenny's Coffee Shop if poor Jenny had to follow the Bank Secrecy Act!

Data compression, pruning of unnecessary data, combining redundant data, and data restructuring, by which I mean, find transaction data that currently Seems necessary to include in transactions but which might not be necessary if we discover more efficient pathways from A to B. Remember that when you make a change to bitcoin's software, each change opens up new possibilities that you might not have thought of before. For example, a side-effect of Segwit is that redundant data in multiple signatures can now be combined. This only works because the signature data is now separated from the transaction data, and can be modified in some ways without changing the transaction information. This opens up data-saving possibilities that we didn't previously have -- if only we can get people to use them.
Once bitcoin has maxed out its current capacity using the data-saving features that are available now, and when several other helpful features are ready such as MAST and the lightning network, Then we can also increase capacity through a block size increase. That's the long-term plan. But we shouldn't scale bitcoin to become a worldwide currency when it isn't ready for that yet, and that is why a block size increase in the short-term is a bad idea.

Companies who handle bitcoins in excess of a certain amount are considered financial service businesses by the government, and all financial service businesses are required to report information about their customers.^(1) That is why online bitcoin companies require identification. Offline wallets are typically not companies, they are just software; they may be created by companies, but those companies don't handle your bitcoins, because if you use an offline wallet, you're handling your bitcoins yourself. Thus, offline wallet makers are not required to report information about the people who use their software.^(2)


Most bitcoin ATMs also fall under the category of financial service businesses and thus many of them also require you to show your ID at the time of sale. They usually have a card swiper where you can swipe your ID card using its magnetic strip. However, there are indeed ways to buy bitcoins without any identification. You might get lucky with an ATM and find one that doesn't require ID, but you could also contact local people who have bitcoins and offer to buy them from them. Check Craigslist, localbitcoins.com, and Bisq to meet up with people and do a physical transfer, where you give them the cash and they send you the bitcoins. There may also be a bitcoin meetup group in your city, if you are in a relatively large town. Meeting an actual person who's involved with bitcoin is a great way to get connected to the bitcoin community.

Therefore if your company merely produces bitcoin software, you do not need to follow the reporting requirements that are part of New York State's Bitlicense. Something similar is true for the rest of the United States as well.

Bitcoin doesn't need to raise the blocksize again to relieve the fee pressure. Blocks aren't full right now -- barely any blocks are bigger than 1.1 megabytes. Why should we make them 4+ megabytes if they aren't even reaching capacity now?
Fees are still optional. You can, right now, without waiting for anything, use second-layer solutions to make daily bitcoin transactions without paying a dime in fees. Payment channels and custodial wallets work --right now-- and allow you to send transactions for free. This is one of the things which makes bitcoin viable for small transactions -- right now.

Change the proof-of-work from SHA256 to some other protocol. Then all their ASICs are useless, because their circuits are integrated to do the SHA256 hashing function, and bitcoin would no longer use it.


The Bitcoin decision making protocol is Nakamoto Consensus. We can just use that. If Bitmain or anyone else had control of mining somehow, and was doing something bad like a 51% attack or censoring transactions, we could make announce a date upon which to change the mining protocol, and on that date Bitmain's hardware would all be useless.

1. You're welcome.
2. You can implement dispute resolution and fraud protection if both parties agree to process the transaction through a multisignature address. How this would work is this: the payer would add funds into the address, but those funds would not immediately go to the recipient. Instead, they would remain in a pending status until both parties agree to complete the payment by providing their private key to the wallet. In case of a dispute, a third party agreed to by both would also have a third private key, which he could use to move the funds to whichever party he adjudicates should be the recipient -- but only if that party provides their private key as well. This is a similar system to what Paypal uses. You can also implement "money back" guarantees by setting this multisignature wallet to automatically return the money to the payer after a certain period of time (say, for example, 31 days), unless he uses his private key to complete the payment to the recipient -- with this stipulation: if after 30 days the payer has not filed a dispute with the third party, then the third party will automatically decide that there was no dispute and therefore sign the transaction over to the recipient using his third key. (This is Not similar to the method Paypal uses, but it does effect almost the same thing: fraud protection with chargebacks, provided you file a legitimate dispute in time and an adjudicator rules in your favor.)
It is important to point out one of the reasons why these types of contractual arrangements are opt-in on the bitcoin network, and why they are not opt-in on Paypal. Bitcoin offers these protections as opt-ins for several reasons, one of which is because there are legitimate scenarios where chargebacks should not not be available. 
I'll use Paypal as an example of why this is important. Suppose you are someone without a bank account, and you want to start using Paypal because it lets you buy from Amazon without a bank account. Setting up a Paypal account is free, so you might start there. But how do you put money into that account if you don't have a bank account, and therefore no ability to fund your Paypal via credit, debit, or bank transfer? One thing you could do is ask someone who has Paypal to send $1000 to your Paypal account, and you'll give them a $1000 in cash in return. So far, so good, this should be an option, and it is. But in Paypal, chargebacks are not opt-in like in bitcoin, they are automatically available to the payer. They just need to file a dispute, and it is written into the terms and conditions of paypal that if a dispute is filed, and the recipient of the money can't provide a shipping number of a product he shipped (as proof that he held up his end of the arrangement), the chargeback can be approved. Now, in this case, it shouldn't be, because no product was shipped, but stuff like this has happened to me before and a simple solution would be if the parties could mutually agree to use an option where chargebacks are impossible. But Paypal doesn't offer that, and Bitcoin does. 
In fact, I believe it is theoretically impossible for Paypal to offer a chargebackless option and still maintain control of their platform. If they can't take money out of your account and put it in another user's, then they don't control their platform. And if they Can take money out of one user's account and put it in another person's, then they can't offer any option where chargebacks are impossible, because at a fundamental level they always have the ability to effect a chargeback.
For this reason, bitcoin is better than Paypal, because you can use chargeback protection and fraud protection and third-party legal contracts if you want, but you may also opt to do a standard bitcoin transaction, where chargebacks are impossible. And this is a use-case that Paypal cannot offer. Therefore bitcoin is better -- at least in one respect.


Optional. Today I used my Gdax wallet to make a transaction, and it confirmed after a considerable amount of time (more than one hour, but less than five). If you use the Gdax wallet, you don't have to pay any money for the transaction fees. They are not the only wallet provider to offer transactions where you do not pay fees; but most users choose to set a fee because it makes transactions confirm faster. And there is no cap to how high they can be; today, a standard low fee transaction for confirmation in under 40 minutes would be about 42 cents. But you can make them as high as you want; the more you pay, the faster the transaction gets confirmed.


Optional. There are sellers on Localbitcoins who will sell you bitcoins for cash at less than the market exchange rates because they are trying to get cash more quickly than the 3-5 business days that it takes to get cash off an exchange. The exchange I use charges 2.5% I think on top of the market exchange rate.


Can't assure you of the future, but my best guess is that they won't change much. Miners will be getting about .00000001 btc as a block reward for years before the last coin is mined, and going from .00000001 to 0 is not that big of a change, at least not in my imagination. Satoshi seemed to think that there will always be miners willing to confirm feeless transactions -- presumably when the mempool is cleared of all fee-paying transactions, meaning you'd have to wait longer for such times. In my mind, miners will surely only process transactions when it is profitable, meaning at least Some transactions in each block will have to have mining fees. But keep in mind that if miners aren't profiting off miner fees alone, the difficulty will automatically adjust downward, so that they can still profit from lower fee rewards.


They can, and I hope they do, because I would like to see what features it offers that bitcoin doesn't. Since bitcoin is open source and anyone can add features to wallets, I imagine no centralized closed-source cryptocurrency will ever be able to compete with it, because any feature another coin offers can simply be added to bitcoin if it's popular and people want it. Moreover, I imagine that bitcoin will forever have one feature that Paypal will never implement -- bitcoin is user-controlled. I control my own node, I only run the software I want to run, and no one can take my money. I don't think Paypal would implement a coin where they delegate all that control to their users. But I'd love to see what they Do offer and test it out.

Bitcoin is the only coin I own, but I don't think altcoins are bad. I have a lot of respect for the Litecoin team and for some of the people on the Ethereum team, though my level of respect for them goes up and down almost as often as they propose something new for their roadmap. Currently I am very disappointed in them and I hope they get their act together before their blockchain becomes unusable. In general, it's important to have altcoins so that we can experiment with code and see how it works when it runs on a blockchain with real-world value; Litecoin in particular has been really useful with this, as they occasionally implement bitcoin upgrades on their blockchain before we do, and thus they help us test the security of these upgrades. I think most other altcoins are scams; a few seem like they have some good ideas behind them; for example, I like the fact that Dash essentially built a coin mixer directly into their reference client. But almost all altcoins -- including Dash -- are actually centralized and are run by companies or individuals that are, in my opinion, untrustworthy. Most of the time, these companies use the words "blockchain" and "decentralization" as marketing buzzwords without actually helping the underlying technology, and that seems scammy to me.

If you run your transactions through a node that you do not control, the person who does control the node gets to decide what network your transaction gets broadcast on. Suppose they switch to bitcoin gold, or another fork. You would have no control over that until after they made the switch, at which point you could, of course, opt to use a different wallet, one that connects to the real bitcoin network. This was an issue with bitpay, which was originally planning to switch to the 2x fork last month, until the 2x fork was cancelled. Anyone using bitpay as a wallet would have had to switch wallets in order to stay connected to the bitcoin network. But if you control your own node, then you directly control what network you are connected to. And no one can change it without your consent.

I do believe they would never actually get deposited into address A on the blockchain. If LN transactions had to go into your payment address on the blockchain before you could send them to someone else's address, that would seem to require two transactions every time you close a channel -- once to your own address and a second one to the other person's. I've only ever heard of one closing transaction bring required, so it is my understanding that LN contracts contrive to send the funds to one or more off-network addresses from a single on-network address that has sufficient funds to send them all at once, and then reimburses that address on-network. I could be wrong, but I don't see any other way to do it without paying at least two miner fees.

It seems to me that right now the easiest gateway into bitcoin for people with no experience is by using the Cash app from Square. If I remember correctly, the time from setup to purchasing and withdrawing my bitcoins was very fast; I only had to give them my social security number and type in my credit/debit card number so that I could make USD payments and/or purchase bitcoins. Since Square is a reputable company, I imagine most people will be okay trusting them with that info. The website you linked to appears to be from before the Cash app integrated bitcoin support, so that's probably why the Cash app isn't on their list of ways to buy bitcoins with a credit/debit card. But right now it seems to me to be the easiest way to do it, and they should also be able to use the integrated bitcoin wallet inside the Cash app to send btcs to any address you provide them with as part of your company.

No. You might also do it if you need onchain funds for some reason. One reason you might want onchain funds is because only an onchain tx can record data on the blockchain using op_return, which some people want/need to do. That's just one small example that popped off the top of my head, and I think it's a pretty small use-case; but I'm sure there are other, more prominent use-cases for onchain transactions that I could think of after a few minutes of thought. Lightning payments are useful if you need to make a fast and cheap payment for something. But fast and cheap payments are not the only things bitcoin is good for; for many other use-cases, onchain transactions are better, and if you need onchain funds, one good way to get them is to close a channel.


The channel closure fee is set aside when you open a channel using the initial channel-opening funds, so it doesn't cost anything extra to close a channel. The real question is: will it become prohibitively expensive to *open* a lightning channel, since at that moment you have to prepay the channel closure fee in addition to the onchain fee to move your onchain funds into the channel. Whether that will be expensive or not depends on how congested the network is; which we can't absolutely predict, but we can say we are working on solutions to enable more onchain transactions so that network congestion rarely happens. Some of these methods include: batching transactions, space-saving signatures (such as Schnorr signatures), a more efficient way of storing contractual data (via MAST), channel factories, and, after all that, a block size increase. Hopefully these scaling improvements will make onchain transactions cheap enough that opening a channel won't be prohibitively expensive. We shall see.

Yes, the software does allow it, and yet people have been prosecuted before for doing things the software allows. Like hacking. All successful hacks do things the software allows, whether that's because of poorly designed software or because of poorly chosen passwords. But nonetheless, if Party A (who has many U.S. customers) doesn't want you to take $500,000 from them, and if they can make a case that you "abused the system" to do that (even if you didn't), a government will likely be sympathetic.


Governments have this funny idea where it's okay for *them* to break into someone else's computer to take their money, but it's not okay if *you* do it without their authorization.


Maybe so. But I think that governments treat exchanges like mini banks, and if a relatively large exchange such as Coinbase got "stolen" from (even if it's not actual theft), I think the government would want to be seen as "protecting its citizens" (i.e. the Coinbase customers) and therefore would prosecute the "thieves" (even if they're not really thieves). And at the same time they would hammer home the message: "You shouldn't be using bitcoin. It's only a matter of time until you're hacked." And people who don't do their research would nod their heads and say "Yeah, yeah, it's just dangerous monopoly money -- I don't know why they don't just ban it."

Correct. Bitcoin has something called a difficulty adjustment algorithm which makes it harder or easier to mine based on how many people are currently mining.

We can currently handle ~2500 onchain transactions per block, which is ~2.5 million onchain transactions per week, so it shouldn't be a problem.

I think this idea eliminates proof-of-work. Without that, there's no way to verify which chain is correct.
Let me explain. First, let's call the new, "snapshot" block Genesis-Nova. Now -- suppose a bad actor starts up a bunch of custom nodes right at the time a snapshot happens, but his Genesis-Nova doesn't match the one the real bitcoin network has. His looks almost identical, except it removes 200 BTCs from someone's address and adds it to his own. You, a new user, set up a node right about this time and it starts reaching out for network connections. It finds a bunch of the real bitcoin nodes, but also a bunch of the bad actor's. Without the ability to see which chain is longer and has more proof-of-work, how does this new node know which chain is the valid one? They both consist of only one block.

Then, you can send the qr code on the right, the one that says "Secret," to the person who you want to receive the bitcoins. If they scan that qr code, the one that says "secret," they can receive the bitcoins you sent to the "Share" qr code into their bitcoin wallet.

Let's do some math.
**Lightning math**
A lightning transaction can usually be done for 7 or fewer "hops," assuming a standard 7 degrees of separation between any two nodes in a decentralized network. At an average rate of 1 satoshi per hop, they often cost as little as 7 satoshis or less *total.* That's not satoshis per byte; 7 satoshis (or less) is the *total fee* for a great many lightning payments. (Note: it's difficult to determine exactly what other lightning users are paying because lightning payments are private; I can only go by my own payments, I have no way to know what others are paying. On bch this is easier to calculate because there is very little privacy; all payments, and their amounts, their fee rates, their origin, and their destination are totally public, reported on the blockchain for all to see.)
**BCH math**
Compare that to bch. On bch's recent stress test day, where they tried to do millions of micropayments and dozens of larger payments on bch, the block they all pointed to to show their big achievement was [this 23 mb block]( The average fee per payment in that block was ~262 satoshis. I got that estimate by dividing the fee total, 0.25493437 bch, by the number of transactions, 97,318, and got a result of ~.00000262 bch per transaction.
A typical lightning payment costs up to 7 satoshis in btc. That's $0.00045 USD.
A typical bch payment costs up to 262 satoshis in bch. That's $0.0013 USD.
A lightning btc payment is over 3 times cheaper than an onchain bch payment. Specifically it is 2.8888... times cheaper.

Do you think $10 fees are unacceptable? Then use an option where you don't pay such a high fee. If you think they Are acceptable, then what's the problem? The people who are paying $10 per transaction clearly think it's worth it, and no one can stop them from overpaying if they want to. But it doesn't mean You have to pay that much. Use whatever option works best for you.

Neither really, it's just someone or some group offered to sell 1200 full bitcoins for $17250 each. The price won't go higher than that until all 1200 are sold. That's a lot of coins at one single price point, so it will probably take several hours to break through it once people start buying at that price.
As of the moment I type this, the price of bitcoin is $17110 on gdax, we were pushing on the $17250 wall a few minutes ago but haven't bought all those coins yet.

I can only guess, but in my imagination there will be several factors keeping fees low or non-existent. One is that there will be wallets which offer the feature of finding you a cheap route. But secondly, I imagine this will play out like email did in the 90s to early 2000s. Getting an email address often used to cost money, because sending data packets isn't quite free for the server. But since the costs of hosting/sending emails are relatively low, some companies (like Yahoo) began offering free email and absorbing the costs in return for good publicity and consequent centralization as more users gravitated toward their free service. I imagine the same thing will happen on the lightning network, and most users will choose to connect to a popular provider who offers to route transactions for free to anyone connected to their server. But we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:05:06
Unused bitcoins take up less space on the blockchain than circulating bitcoins, because bitcoins in circulation are sent to peoples' addresses, and this movement is additional information which must be tracked. It is cheaper for node operators to just leave those coins as lost, and this cost analysis disincentives node operators from running software which recirculates lost bitcoins.
Also, the "proof of authority" idea makes it harder for people to save their money or leave it as an inheritance. Suddenly you have to worry about node operators stealing your money just because you haven't used it in a while and they presume that means it's lost. Putting a time limit on bitcoin addresses makes people not want to use them. I can see the slogan for this hard-fork idea: "Time-bomb coin -- if you don't pay attention, this thing will blow up your money."

Revolut does seem pretty cool -- and they currently allow bitcoin purchases, which is cool -- so don't take this as me dumping on them, because I'm a fan. But I wouldn't trust them to continue supporting bitcoin in the future, because bitcoin is an alternative to the banking system, which Revolut is currently a part of. They've supported bitcoin so far -- perhaps they'll continue to do so and eventually leave the banking system. But right now that's clearly not in their plans, and as bitcoin takes more people out of the banking system, Revolut will have to make a choice about whether they will continue to support what it is doing. I don't yet trust them to make the right choice when the time comes.

It had no serious effects. The would-be victim used some security methods to withstand the attack without going down; these methods may have included blocking ip addresses that were part of the attack, adding bandwidth to handle the incoming capacity, and/or having a backup server. The attacker eventually ran out of time and/or bandwidth and/or processors and/or ip addresses and couldn't continue the attack. No serious harm done.

Only if Bitmain had enough miners going to mine blocks in the interval. If they have any miners running at all (which I doubt, other than for testing purposes), they would probably only be able to mine 1 or 2 blocks before the other miners would come back online, because it would take them much longer than 10 minutes, since their hashpower would be so low and the requisite hash rate is so high. And by then the other miners would have patched their hardware's source code and we'd be back up and running.
The mistake you are making is thinking that Bitmain is a significant miner just because they manufacture mining hardware. They aren't. No more than Dell controls a significant share of Internet servers just because they are a popular manufacturer of Internet servers. The people who own that hardware are the ones in control of it, not the manufacturer. Here's another analogy: Hoover Sweepers is a popular manufacturer of sweepers. But they don't control those sweepers, their customers do. Same with Bitmain. Bitmain isn't a significant miner; they probably have a few miners running for testing purposes, but their infrastructure is totally different from a mining facility's. They manufacture mining hardware and sell it to others for other people to use. You have to be a miner to have any hashpower, and Bitmain isn't a miner (other than the few hardware units they test for bugchecking purposes), therefore they don't have any significant amount of hashpower.

You are right that this has already been thought of, and there are already ways to approximate its results, though there are some drawbacks.
If you want to run your own node without downloading the whole blockchain, you can transfer someone else's copy of the blockchain to your computer via a USB stick and plug it into your node -- it goes in the app data subdirectory of your computer -- and thus skip the time-consuming part of setting up a node. The only drawback to this is that it involves trusting someone else to have verified the blockchain correctly.
You can also turn on a pruning setting in your node, which is a built-in option in Bitcoin Core; enabling this setting causes your node to only keep the most recent blocks and not keep the whole blockchain. The only drawback to this is that your node won't be able to share old blocks with others, and thus that aspect of the network doesn't get additional decentralization from your node.
There is not currently any node software that I'm aware of that takes a snapshot of the blockchain as you propose, but the above methods can approximate that and achieve the same result, especially if used in combination.
However there is one other drawback to the simple snapshot method: if an attacker started up a bunch of fake nodes at the same time as the snapshot happened, ones which had a snapshot exactly the same as the true snapshot -- except that it moved ten bitcoins from an early address into the attacker's address -- there would be no way for a new node to tell which snapshot is correct except by processing the blockchain from the beginning, which is the very thing you're trying to avoid.
So yes this has been thought of, and there are ways to approximate it already -- but the simple snapshot method has a security vulnerability which has resulted in no one making this simple method available as code, especially because you can already approximate its result more securely by copying someone else's blockchain via a USB stick and then turning on pruning from that point on.

"Not mining" is not more efficient than mining, it's the opposite. Energy efficiency is a function of dollars per kilowatt hour, that's an objective standard of measuring efficiency and you do not increase your dollars per kilowatt hour by not using electricity, no more than you increase your miles per gallon by not using your car. 0 miles per gallon is not more efficient than 60 miles per gallon, it's less efficient. Refusing to use your energy resources is more wasteful than producing something with it. You use your computer to type things on reddit and you don't complain, you use your tv to watch the walking dead and don't complain, and those are forms of nonproductive energy usage. Bitcoin mining is a form of productive energy usage and it is also more efficient than any tv or computer.

Steps 13-15 use an offline device, i.e the part where you sign the transaction. Steps 6-12 use an online device because creating a transaction in coinb.in involves looking data on the blockchain, specifically how many inputs your address has in it. But you could just download the blockchain if you didn't want to use an online device for any part of the procedure. I figure most people are okay with using the internet as long as their private keys aren't put on it.

Sort of. Your chances go down if your computer is slow at mining, which involves processing pseudorandom cryptographic data. But technically even a slow computer has a chance of processing the data first, because the pseudorandom nature of the data means that sometimes a block of data will be easy for your particular computer to mine, and you could just be lucky. But if you don't want to rely on luck, like most people, you'd want to buy lots of very fast mining hardware, and upgrade it as the network gets bigger and the hashrate goes up -- which, of course, is all somewhat expensive. And having that many specialized computers burns a lot of electricity too, which is also expensive.

Channels will likely be handled on the backend, the average user won't know about them. It's like asking What if everyone redoes the routing tables on their WiFi routers all at once? How will the network handle all that restructuring and reestablish connections quickly?
It won't happen because people aren't tech savvy enough to go messing around with their channels. The software will handle it and only close a channel when necessary; and if something breaks on someone's individual node, he/she can get it fixed without taking down the network, because a million people's nodes would have to close their channels all at once for that to happen, and the software will be designed so that that doesn't happen.
Remember, it's a decentralized network. What happens to other people's nodes doesn't affect yours (unless it's your counterparty) so there's no single point of failure that could cause millions of people to need to close their channels all at once.

I can confirm that any child addresses and its private key can be easily computed from the master private key; this results in lower storage requirements, because you only need to store the master private key, and then you can compute everything else from that.
The SO answer is correct that you cannot sign transactions using the master private key itself. Instead, what you do is you derive the child address where the utxo you want to use is located, and you compute the private key of that child address using the master private key, and then sign the transaction using that private key.

I've also heard of reusable payment codes, stealth addresses, and bip70-style addresses.
Also, 3multisig and 3segwit are actually the same kind of address, and if you really want to keep them separate, then -- in order to be consistent -- you'd need to include millions of other types that also begin with a 3. Addresses beginning with a 3 are all p2sh addresses, which stands for "pay to script hash." The short version of what they do is, money sent to these addresses can only be spent if the private key holder "unlocks" it by executing a script on the blockchain, specifically a script made of text which, when hashed, looks identical to the p2sh address. Only the private key holder knows what script produces that hash, partly because his wallet typically includes data in that script that only he can produce, such as his digital signature. Multisig and segwit are simply two types of scripts, and therefore 3-style wallets can be created using them. But technically ANY bitcoin script -- or combination of bitcoin scripts -- can be hashed together to create a 3-style address, so if you really want to keep these two separate, then for consistency's sake you'll likely need to also include all the millions of other potential funky script types that can be turned into 3-style addresses.

The first found block is added to the chain. But not all nodes receive that block at the same time, because they're scattered all over the world, and it takes a few minutes to share the block with the whole network. In the intervening few minutes, sometimes a part of the network will find a different block that "works," and, since it's the first block they see, they think that one is the "first one." This results in a conflict on the network.
There is a simple way to resolve these conflicts, though, and this solution is built into node software: all the nodes keep in their memory all the blocks they receive so long as they "work," i.e. they are valid. Then, they wait until they receive another block; that new block must be built on one of the blocks in their memory, because there are no other blocks to build off of. Whichever one it got built on top of, that one is the correct one, because it has now produced the most proof-of-work. All nodes are designed to accept the chain that has the most valid proof-of-work.

Information transmitters are not the same thing as money transmitters, even if they transmit information which can be used to pay someone money. If I send you my bank account info via a bike messenger, the bike messenger doesn't have to obtain a money transmitter license because he didn't transmit money, he transmitted information which you used later to withdraw some money when the bike messenger was gone. The transaction happens between you and me, not between you and me and the bike messenger. LN nodes transmit payment information to a merchant who later withdraws money via the blockchain from the payer. Lightning network nodes do not transfer bitcoins or even a substitute for bitcoins. They just give you payment information, like the bike messenger does. The exchange of value happens at the time of settlement and is a peer-to-peer transaction processed by the blockchain, not by the lightning network's nodes. LN nodes can be completely offline and out of the picture when the transaction of value occurs -- just like the bike messenger was out of the picture in the earlier example. The LN nodes do their job by providing payment information; another network processes the transfer of value. LN nodes do not need to obtain exemption from the fincen law any more than bike messengers do; they are information transmitters, not money transmitters.
BTW cross-chain swaps are Also peer-to-peer transactions. They involve me stating in contractual form that I'll take X number of altcoins for Y number of bitcoins; if someone takes me up on that offer, then I put my bitcoins in a payment channel and you put your altcoins in a payment channel, and we swap automatically when the amounts in the channel match the amounts I specified in my contract. This is a peer-to-peer swap and only the transaction signatures and contract information are passed along through the lightning network. Then their job is finished -- they've transmitted information and can go offline now if they want to. The actual transaction of value happens on the respective blockchains -- altcoins leave your address and go to mine on the altcoin blockchain, and bitcoins leave my address and go to yours on the bitcoin blockchain, peer to peer. No need for a money transmitter license when you're only transmitting information and not money.

Yes because the $100 goes to Bob's node first, and sits in his payment channel as an unspendable transaction until Alice receives it.
Here is how a network payment is described on the Bitcoin Wiki, assuming that Alice wants to send a payment to Charlie through Bob:
Alice opens a payment channel to Bob, and Bob opens a payment channel to Charlie.
Alice wants to buy something from Charlie for 1000 satoshis.
Charlie generates a random number and generates its SHA256 hash. Charlie gives that hash to Alice.
Alice uses her payment channel to Bob to pay him 1,000 satoshis, but she adds the hash Charlie gave her to the payment along with an extra condition: in order for Bob to claim the payment, he has to provide the data which was used to produce that hash.
Bob uses his payment channel to Charlie to pay Charlie 1,000 satoshis, and Bob adds a copy of the same condition that Alice put on the payment she gave Bob.
Charlie has the original data that was used to produce the hash (called a pre-image), so Charlie can use it to finalize his payment and fully receive the payment from Bob. By doing so, Charlie necessarily makes the pre-image available to Bob.
Bob uses the pre-image to finalize his payment from Alice.

(A) We don't trust Bitmain
(B) We wouldn't have to trust Bitmain even if they had 100% of the hashing power, because we can cut them off if they start censoring transactions or doing doublespend attacks
(C) Bitmain's "control" of 40%+ of the hashrate is not real. Bitmain manufactures the most popular mining hardware, but they don't run that hardware themselves. Several independent pools buy the hardware from them and run it on their own, which causes a global distribution of Bitmain's hardware and, yes, decentralizes mining
(D) The closest thing Bitmain has to "control" over mining is the fact that they put a kill switch on all their miners (known as the "antbleed" exploit); but, since the software is open-source, if they ever use it, the affected miner can simply patch it using the open-source fix provided by other bitcoin devs at antbleed.com. (In fact the patch is super simple -- you only need to change one line of code.) So Bitmain can't really do anything significant with their kill switch, because it only takes a few minutes to get back up and running if they ever use it

Another good privacy improvement available right now is to use a lightning wallet. The initial onchain transaction that funds your lightning channel isn't particularly private, but after that point, all lightning payments are routed in a manner similar to Tor -- no one along your route or even at your destination knows what address or node the payment originated from. If you make your channel a private channel you get even better privacy -- no one on the network can see your node or how much money is in it, except your channel partner.

Atomic swaps involve sending your bitcoins to someone else's address, and this transaction is confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain, which costs transaction fees. The litecoins you get are also sent to a litecoin address that you control, and that too costs transaction fees on the litecoin blockchain.

Bitcoin is a green technology which encourages increased adoption of green energy in places where it was never possible before  as well as industrial-level research into the development of cheaper forms of energy. It directly incentivizes miners to compete with one another for cheap and renewable energy and rewards them for finding it. Core's solution to energy pollution was to develop bitcoin.

That is a very good point. I hope it would hold up in court, but I suspect it wouldn't, because in courts logic and facts don't always matter. Often, what matters is money and keeping up a good public image.


I don't consider it illegal, but I bet the government would, if a service like Coinbase and/or their customers lost millions of dollars because of it. (Actually it wouldn't be "because of" the 51% attack -- it would be because of their own stupid decision to trust a blockchain that has weak security. But they, of course, would claim it wasn't their fault, and I think their money and "good public image" would talk loudly in their favor.)
Perhaps if we spread awareness better -- a sort of meme or something like "bch has a built-in backdoor: the 51% attack" or "bch: the low-security blockchain" -- and if we connect that security hole with public knowledge, that might help in case a 51% attack on bch ever goes to court. The defense could make an argument such as the following:




The problem I see is that the whitepaper which they claim represents their coin explicitly calls this an attack. The very way we talk about 51% "attacks" involves using language that assigns blame. It makes it very hard to legally defend someone's right to do this when we call it an "attack" and the white paper contrasts such an attack with "honest[y]."

Thanks for building a useful service! I look forward to its launch.
A few things to note: toward the end of your video there's a table of features which compares Lightning Collect with traditional payments and onchain bitcoin payments. Some of the stuff on this graph is confusing. For example, next to "Debit/Credit Card Expiry" there's a green checkmark for bitcoin and lightning, but a red x for traditional payments. That makes it look like traditional payment cards do not expire, but bitcoin and lightning wallets do. I'm sure that's not what you intend, but it's what it looks like, at least to me.
Something similar can be said for the last feature -- "High Currency Conversion Fee." You mark this with an orange line for lightning and bitcoin, which I think means they have *somewhat* high conversion fees? And then you mark traditional payments with a red X, which I think means they *don't have* high conversion fees. Is that what you mean? Because it's a bit weird. The meaning of the orange line isn't obvious, but just as importantly, the red X normally means something bad, but in this case, you *don't want* high conversion fees, so you'd paradoxically *want* the red X -- signifying something bad, usually, but it also seems to mean "doesn't have this" -- next to this "feature," because "high fees" is not a feature you want. It might make more sense if you switched the feature's name to "Low currency conversion fees" and then used just red and green marks.
I still look forward to the launch of your service!

If the miners took down the whole network, I think we'd have to start fresh with a new blockchain, and achieve decentralization the hard way: by playing the long game. In such a scenario, I wouldn't be surprised if an altcoin straight up took bitcoin's place. (My first thought would be to start using Litecoin, though I'd want to hear objections first, as I'm sure there are plenty of objections -- including the fact that its dev team has an identifiable leader in Charlie Lee, and he is currently an outsized influence on Litecoin's development team, which is an element of centralization -- i.e. centralization around a particular leader.)

Regarding your centralization question, I regard it like Walmart. Walmart may represent centralized shopping, but I think they should be an option for people who want to shop there. Similarly, I regard hub centralization on the lightning network as a nonthreat for two reasons: if people want to connect to a centralized server, they should be allowed to, and it's not a threat because if you don't want to connect to that server -- guess what? Just don't connect to it. Route your payment through someone else.
Also, why would you move your money out of the lightning network? Having it on there means instant transactions and no fees or low fees. If no one takes their money out of it, we don't have to worry about channels closing too often.

Oh, your LED lightbulbs are more energy efficient than bitcoin? Let's run the numbers and see.
An average LED lightbulb uses 36000 joules per hour. There are 8766 hours in a year, let's suppose you only run it for a third of those (because you don't turn it on at night or when you're at work) and it uses 105,192,000 joules per year. At an electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh, you lose $30 a year running just one led lightbulb.
An average Antminer S7 uses 5760000 joules per hour. Supposing a miner runs it all year, they use 50,492,160,000 joules per year. But you know what happens to the miner's dollars per kWh? It's the opposite of yours. Instead of Losing money per year, the miner Gains money. A miner's electricity usage is MUCH more efficient than your lightbulbs because his energy usage is *productive* -- it generates an income that exceeds his cost. In terms of dollars per hour, bitcoin mining is Much more energy efficient than using that same electricity to run a lightbulb, because whereas your lightbulb Costs you dollars per hour, mining Makes you dollars per hour.

Surprisingly, no, it's not easy to fix. Any method that uses a shortcut to avoid processing the whole blockchain inherently involves not verifying the proof-of-work, and the proof-of-work is the only thing that guarantees the blockchain's security. That doesn't mean "shortcuts" are bad, but it does mean you have to trust someone in order to do them. If you know someone who has done the proof-of-work up to this point and you trust that person, there should be no harm in using their verified and indexed copy of the blockchain, or even taking a snapshot from them; doing this doesn't affect the security of the network, in part because it's a private affair between you and someone you know, and thus you two are the only people involved.
But the snapshot method can't be a network policy because we can't trust the whole network to give us valid snapshots. It is constantly under attack, and if snapshots were a network policy, literally any of the attackers could get on the network and start handing out false snapshots. If you, as a bitcoin node user, don't do proof-of-work except starting from after the snapshot was taken, then how do you know whether or not the snapshot itself is correct? The only way to verify that a snapshot is valid is to run the proof-of-work algorithm on it, and that requires downloading blocks from before the snapshot was taken; which, if you do that, then you are susceptible to the same attack unless verify Those blocks in the same manner.
I'm not trying to say there's no way to shortcut the proof-of-work process -- you can shortcut the proof-of-work process as long as you get your snapshot from someone you trust and as long as that person doesn't try to scam you. In fact, by copying someone else's blockchain via a USB stick and then turning on the "pruning" option once it's in your node, you can essentially already do this. By inserting their copy of the blockchain into your node, you trust their blockchain to be valid up to the present time. By turning on pruning, you discard everything prior to the most recent blocks, which is essentially the same thing as taking a snapshot. And after that point your node starts doing the proof-of-work the same way everyone else's does, except you've short-cutted the first 500,000 blocks or so. This is perfectly acceptable and it's already an option for every individual user. But although it's acceptable for individuals to do, the whole network can't make it a network policy that we'll all trust snapshots, because if we did, it would break the proof-of-work on the whole network. *Somebody* has to do the proof-of-work; and, to keep it decentralized, it must remain an option for all nodes, even if not all of them choose to actually do it.

I agree, but perhaps not for a $1000 order. For a $50 order I'm sure you'd have no problems within a few cents of the spot price. But for $1000 it ought to move it at least a dozen dollars. Your $82 jump is a bit unexpectedly high, but perhaps Square Cash is connected to an exchange with low liquidity.


There are always people offering to sell bitcoin at more than the market value. Exchanges work by pairing up buyers with sellers; the sellers use a piece of software called an order book to post what prices they are willing to sell at and how many bitcoins they have available for sale at that price. When a buyer accepts that amount, the trade gets approved and the exchange takes a fee for pairing up the two. You can check the order books at most exchanges, [including Gdax]( (now known as Coinbase Pro), to see the many, many offers of bitcoins for sale at higher than the spot price. In the column just left of center, marked "order book," all the numbers in red are price points above the spot price where someone has offered to sell bitcoins at that price.
You can also view this using another graph, the depth chart, which you can access by clicking the phrase "depth chart" on that page -- it's in the central column, near the top right of the panel called "price chart." On that graph, sale-offers are also in red, but here they are represented by an ascending line. If you hover over that line, you can see what prices people are offering to sell bitcoins at on Coinbase Pro -- currently there are offers to sell bitcoins for as much as $11,220, which is obviously WAAAY over the current spot price.

I'm confident that part of our disagreement regards the interpretation of the LN mechanism rather than the operation of the LN mechanism. You just said "[nothing] any more at all" connects the buyer and the receiver. In my last post I brought up the transaction as an obvious exception, yet you responded "No" and mentioned "[not] any more." Is that an admission that it connected them at one point? If so, then I think you will quickly acknowledge that in this transaction between buyer and seller something was transacted between the buyer and the seller. Both parties gave something which they would not have done without receiving something from the other. So what, in your interpretation, does the recipient receive from the buyer?
In my interpretation, the seller, let's call him Bob, receives from the buyer, let's call her Anne, via the LN, information that he can use to withdraw funds on the blockchain, or which he can use to send money to someone else. Anne can only give what she herself has. What she has is a connection to a payment system, which does not involve any interaction from a third party other than to transmit payment information, in a similar manner to a bike messenger. In fact, after transmitting information, the third party (or parties) may go offline and die for all Anne cares -- her transaction does not depend on them for anything transactional -- she only needs them to transmit payment information.
So that's what she has -- now what does she do with it? She opens up her app, scans a qr code, and sends information to Bob via the lightning network. She hasn't sent payment -- she has given Bob something else. And not a substitute for money either, no more than a bike messenger gives you a subtitute for money when he provides you with my bank account info. Anne has given Bob the information he needs to conduct a contractual payment on the blockchain, and this payment is fully automated, it does not involve other people, and all the necessary information and funding is available without anyone else's involvement: all the LN nodes can go offline -- we know that because the payment happens on the blockchain, not on the lightning network -- and all the payment channel counterparties can die and be buried -- that's how we know it does not require any third party interaction. The only thing anyone needed was for information to be transmitted -- not money. The money part happens automatically whenever Bob wishes, without anyone else being involved.
Do you disagree with any of that?

You should use a swap provider to create incoming liquidity. Go to lightningconductor.net and send him a lightning payment; in return, he will send you an onchain payment of the same amount, minus a miner fee. The result is that you'll have plenty of incoming capacity.
Eventually you'll be able to do this trustlessly with submarine swaps, and a test website for that has [already gone up]( though it currently only supports onchain-to-lightning payments. But right now the best swap provider is Lightning Conductor, and, unfortunately, his service is not yet trustless.

Bitcoin's "immutability" allows for one way to change the data on the blockchain, though it's a difficult way. It's described in the whitepaper: "[a] block cannot be changed without redoing the [proof-of-work]. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change [any] block...include[s] redoing all the blocks after it." (Section 4)
See also this paragraph:


And this one:


In Section 11, Satoshi specifies that a chain reorganization can be used to "take back" (undo) a transaction, though the whitepaper assumes that this would only be done by an attacker trying to do a double-spend after a payment gets confirmed. (Satoshi therefore calls such a user an "attacker." In one of the above quotations, I changed "an attacker" to "[a user]" -- in brackets -- because a person or group doing a chain reorg is not necessarily attacking anyone, as demonstrated by the quote from Section 5 of the whitepaper.)
Regarding softforks, the fact that softforks can be done does not increase bitcoin's mutability. An analogy I've heard is this: imagine you worked at a company who required that everyone wear a tie. That's a rule that every employee is required to follow, similar to a consensus rule on the bitcoin network that all network nodes are required to follow. (E.g. "no more than 21 million coins.") Now, suppose some of the workers formed a club -- the Red Tie Club -- and anyone who wanted to join that club had to wear a red tie. Well, wearing a red tie is an additional restriction compared to the rule that everyone else at the company is following, but it's also not a violation of the company rule -- the company rule just says you've got to wear a tie, and members of the Red Tie Club are doing that. That's what a soft-fork is like: an additional restriction on bitcoin's rules. It doesn't break immutability because it keeps all the previous rules and just adds a new one.
If following the whitepaper counts as "not really immutable," just because the whitepaper allows one (difficult) way to change blocks -- then count me in that camp, because that's the way I want to do things.

The lightning network doesn't reuse addresses. If you keep your money on the lightning network, you can use Tor to anonymize your transactions beyond the privacy that comes from single-use addresses.

You're not counting the overhead costs of running a bank and you Are counting the overhead costs of running the bitcoin network. You only bring up the overhead costs of running a bank to dismiss them and say online banks don't have as many overhead costs. But you know what? They still have massive overhead costs, including electricity costs and server hardware, and they are less efficient than bitcoin is at using those resources. Bitcoin miners are more efficient with their energy usage than online banks because the electricity used for mining directly translates to income, whereas for banks, electricity is merely one of many overhead costs. Find a bank where electricity is 70% of their company expenditures and you'll find a bank heavily invested in energy efficiency. Bitcoin mining is incredibly efficient -- miners cannot afford to use coal and oil when their competitors are using geothermal in Iceland, solar panels in Arizona, and wind farms in China. You don't hear about banks setting up renewable energy infrastructure to reduce electricity costs, do you? But you do with bitcoin -- miners move to places where there is no electrical grid to pay and they install solar panels, wind farms, geothermal vents, and mine using those renewable resources. The miner with the cheapest source of abundant energy wins the most bitcoins. Bitcoin directly incentivizes the green energy revolution.
The incentive people Used to have to install solar panels was "You can save $500 a year on your electricity bill!" Compare that to "You can earn $500 a day mining bitcoin!" and you can see why so many people are getting involved in renewable energy today than they were before. As a direct result of bitcoin's energy protocol, it has become unprofitable to mine using oil and coal, and miners have switched to renewable resources and are creating the infrastructure to support this new industrial need in places that have never had power before. The bitcoin revolution is pumping the green energy revolution. Places where there is no electrical grid are skipping the "coal and oil" phase and jumping straight to renewable energy because miners are setting up that infrastructure because they can't afford to use an electrical grid that renewable energy out-competes. Thank you bitcoin.

Actually they fixed it with a softfork. 


If it had been a hard-fork, the older clients wouldn't have accepted the block reorg, since hard forks use incompatible rules. But since it was only a soft-fork, the rules were compatible, and thus all the older clients acknowledged the block reorg as valid proof-of-work. And, since the reorg'd chain got longer than the older client's chain at block 74691, the older clients accepted the reorg because all clients agree that the chain with the most valid proof-of-work is the true one, even if they've been building on a different chain for a long time.

I'm not saying you should stop using the labels you've chosen for this beta release, I'm just pointing out a couple of areas where, some time down the line, there might be room for further improvement. I'm sure you know there are more important things here at the "early adopter" phase than having perfect technical precision in matters such as labelling things, and I think you've found a defensible balance between "fast enough learning curve" and "accurate enough." But someday people will be ready for more accurate labels.)
That said, if you want to head in the direction of increased accuracy (but less familiar terminology to newbs), "accounts" is somewhat of an inaccurate description for addresses on a decentralized network. You could be more precise by just calling them addresses. Setting up an account, at least to my mind, calls up images of typing in credentials, and waiting for a gatekeeper to verify them before I can access whatever it is I'm trying to access. That's not what happens on the blockchain, so it's technically a bit imprecise to call these things accounts. But I understand why you're do it; even Andreas Antonopoulos sometimes says things like, "With bitcoin you can create an account just by downloading an app." The "accounts" metaphor is simple for newbs to grasp, and addresses have a lot in common with accounts, except there's no gatekeeper.
Also, your distinction between "lightning accounts" and "blockchain accounts" doesn't reflect the fact that all lightning addresses are on the blockchain. In a sense, all the "accounts" in your app are blockchain addresses; it's just that *some* of these blockchain addresses can only be spent from if you follow certain contractual procedures, procedures that allow the lightning network to function. I'm not sure of a more accurate way to put this that isn't also confusing for newbs, so once again I'm not telling you you should change this (at least not now), but highlighting things like this might help people get their creative juices flowing so that we can come up with user interfaces that are both easier to use and more accurate in their terms. You also have the option of abandoning technical accuracy altogether in order to mask all the confusing stuff; in the interest of "hiding" all the confusing stuff, you might want to consider hiding the distinction between lightning accounts and blockchain accounts; you could just tell the user what their total balance is, put the "send" and "receive" buttons front and center, and hide channel information in settings. Most people will just go with the default channels anyway.
Kudos to you on your app, I look forward to the mainnet release!

No. You may connect to a large node if you want to; if you don't want to, you don't have to.


This question assumes that the answer to number 1 is "yes," but it's not. "Reliance on large nodes" is not a problem because it's not a thing. Connecting to a large node is optional and no one has to do it. It's like asking "Does grocery shopping rely on large Walmarts?" No, going to Walmart is completely optional. "But isn't Walmart centralization a problem though?" Just don't use Walmart if you don't like Walmart. And don't connect to a large node if you don't trust large nodes.


LN's way of ensuring decentralization is to allow you to connect to any node you want to. If you don't want to connect to a large node, connect to a small one. No problem. That small node is still on the lightning network, allowing you to send payments to anyone else on the lightning network.


If there are large nodes, and if they don't keep their location private, then governments can find them and coerce them. But you know what? Large nodes are completely optional. If the government regulates a large node, just don't use it. Connect to a different node. Everything on the lightning network is totally optional, so if you feel uncomfortable with something or smell something fishy, just ignore the fishy-smelling node and connect to someone else.
Honestly, the worst case scenario with this whole "hubs" fud is that you connect to a scammy node, they don't process one of your transactions, and so you disconnect from them and connect to someone else.

I think it has been a very long time since we've had a reorg of more than 2 blocks. I imagine mining had to be pretty centralized if a natural 5-block reorg happened (as opposed to during some stress test in the early days, when miners cooperated to test and debug new protocols on mainnet).

Yeah, that says exactly what I just said: "the value of energy saved [is] sometimes called negawatts, in $/kWh."
Exactly what I said: "Energy efficiency is a function of dollars per kilowatt hour."
Measured in the terms used by the article you just cited, mining bitcoin is literally the most energy efficient thing you can do with your electricity right now. More efficient than watching tv, more efficient than running a fridge, more efficient than your LED lightbulbs. Bitcoin is where it's at in energy efficiency. You don't see any other industry choosing its geographic locations based on the availability of major sources of renewable energy, and creating that infrastructure in places where it didn't exist. Installing solar panels is not just a matter of saving money anymore -- there's a new profit motive in green energy that's never been there before, and it's called bitcoin.

In that case, this idea drastically reduces bitcoin's proof-of-work system, from 500,000+ blocks to 100 blocks. By doing so, it also reduces bitcoin's security.
However, I think it is important to point out that you can currently do something nearly the same using the current protocol if you are willing to risk it. You don't need to download the whole blockchain in order to set up a full node. You can set your node to verify the headers only until it gets to the most recent 100 blocks, and then download those. Moreover, to prevent it from subsequently  growing too large for your system, you can "prune" blocks that are older than some set number. My node does that, it prunes everything except the most recent 500 megabytes. Does that sound like an acceptable compromise?

We can only determine this through (a) anecdotal information (e.g. more bitcoin-accepting companies saying on Twitter or other platforms "Lots more customers used bitcoin this year to buy stuff from us") and (b) confirming that there are more payments recorded on the blockchain.

Channel closure is indeed an onchain transaction, and that's not ideal. However, the use of a lightning channel still helps with scalability, because it reduces onchain transactions significantly. If a person can make 35 lightning payments before they need to close their channel, that saves a lot of space on the blockchain.

At channel creation, you have to sign a transaction that sends your coins to an address in your control and your partner's coins to an address he controls. You don't broadcast this transaction, you just prepare it. Subsequent lightning payments simply update this transaction so that, if and when it gets broadcast, it sends more of the coins to your address or more to your channel partner's address. As part of this transaction, you need to include a fee, same as any other transaction. This is the channel closure fee, and, since it is set at channel creation and doesn't come into play until the time of settlement, it is fair to call it a prepaid transaction fee.


Lightning wallets automatically close your channel if they see that the median fee in recent blocks is larger than your channel closure fee. That's the current method of dealing with this; they could also theoretically notify you and your channel partner so that you could jointly increase the prepaid fee in order to keep the channel alive.

It caused a hasty update to apply a patch before the bug got exploited. If it had been exploited, it would have caused a chain split, with most of the bitcoin network accepting blocks with specially-crafted counterfeit bitcoins (though, like the overflow value bug, it would have been patched rather quickly if it had ever been exploited, which it never was). A minority of nodes -- notably, nodes from before 14.x and nodes not based on Bitcoin Core -- did not have this bug and would have rejected blocks with counterfeit coins, this creating a "minority chain" without counterfeit coins.

CadmeusCain's response was pretty good, so let me just add something to this part:


There are several standards of what counts as user friendly, and some of the tools to build user friendly wallets still need to be developed based on what developers think users want. One of the things that confuses users right now is channel management. How much should I put in a channel? How can I refill my channel if it gets low? How can I receive money if my channel is full? If I don't have a channel, can I still receive lightning payments? These are pain points for users, especially new users, and I think everyone agrees that channel management could use some automation.
For example, right now, when a user puts money in a channel for the first time, they can't receive money until they've spent some -- because their channel is "full." For new users, I don't think that's very user friendly. Should we make a "first-timer" lightning wallet which automatically sends some money from your first channel into a second outbound channel, that way your first channel has some free space available for receiving payments? This might be a bad idea, since it partly empties a user's channel without their say-so, but even if a dev wants to do this, it can't be automated yet, because no tool has been developed for trustlessly sending lightning funds to a new address. (Two potential ways to do this are "splicing out" -- which requires that we build spicing technology first -- and "outbound swaps" -- which also haven't been developed.)
Then there's the difference between "legacy addresses" and lightning channels. Should that distinction be made clear to the user? Or should we mask it so that all they see is their bitcoin balance? Any wallet that masks the distinction will likely need to heavily automate *all* the legacy address functions, not just channel management. And it will also have to detect when a user scans a QR code for a legacy address, and likely splice some funds out of their lightning addresses to pay it, or do an outbound swap -- but neither of those have been built yet.
There are workarounds for this problem: until splicing tech gets built, a lightning wallet which needs to send a legacy payment could simply close a channel to get some funds into a legacy address controlled by the wallet, and then do a CPFP payment to the destination address. Or it could keep a certain amount of the user's balance in legacy addresses on the user's device, just in case they scan a QR code for a non-lightning payment. But that particular solution creates a new (potential) user friendliness problem: it creates a situation where not all of the funds in the user's balance are available for instant payments; what if, during that time, they want to move all their money to a new lightning wallet? If they scan a lightning QR code to move all their funds, only funds in lightning channels will move -- the funds in legacy addresses will need a second transaction, and probably a QR code with a legacy address in it, and then the user will be confused.
(Please somebody finish making splicing tech available so that all of these issues are no longer issues!)
Here's another problem: people can only receive a lightning payment if (a) they already have bitcoins and a lightning channel set up which isn't "full" or (b) someone creates a payment channel to their wallet or (c) they use a custodial service. So what happens to our user friendliness if a user creates a fresh, new lightning wallet, doesn't have any bitcoins, and immediately creates an invoice to receive a lightning payment? Do we just set up the app to tell that person their options and let them handle it? That's not user friendly. So what do we do? We could create an anonymous custodial account for them so they can receive the payment instantly, then automatically create a channel from that node to their wallet, and automatically send over the payment when the channel gets confirmed. That can be done "invisibly," and it's the only way I can think of off the top of my head to let them receive lightning payments instantly if they've never done anything with bitcoin before. But it comes with a serious problem -- for a brief period of time, that means you, the developer, are assuming control of the user's funds; are you, as a dev, willing to do that and shoulder the regulatory risks that come with it?
In short, we're still developing the tools we need to automate stuff; and as these tools get developed, some wallets will automate more and some less, depending on how user friendly the developer wants it to be, or even depending on what the developer thinks *counts* as user friendly. There will be a spectrum of user friendliness. Developers will push out a new wallet and say "Try this new user friendly wallet!" and it won't always match your definition of user friendly yet, because the developer's definition of user friendliness doesn't match yours. But eventually a wallet will get made that has all the features you want, or else you'll learn to live with some limitations -- but things will definitely get more user friendly as time goes on.

The standard way to put this is "Not your *keys*, not your coins." (emphasis added)
Closed-source code certainly has disadvantages compared to open-source code, but I wouldn't include "they have your keys" as one of those disadvantages, because the copyright status of the code has nothing to do with where the keys are generated and/or stored. Closed-source code can generate and store keys on your device just as well as open-source code can -- it's just that closed-source code is copyrighted and open-source code is not.
If a wallet uses closed-source code, for security purposes that code should be publicly viewable and auditable. (Yes, you can do that and still have it be closed-source. Closed-source has to do with the *copyright status* of your code, not with whether people can *review* your code.) And unless you are willing to get back into a "I trust you with my money" scenario, users should also not use any wallet whose code can be auto-updated by the developers. But I'm personally not willing to cast aspersions on all closed-source (i.e. copyrighted) code -- because some of it is very good.

Would you agree with this statement?
Hacking and 51% attacks both have the following properties in common: to do them, you have to use software to do something most people don't do, which most companies who use the software don't want people to do, and which can result in financial losses for those companies if people do it.
My point, btw, is not that 51% attacks are theft; that's not what I'm saying. Actual theft is not necessary if you can convince the *government* that something is theft. And I think if Coinbase got 51% attacked, they could probably convince the government that it was theft, even if the attacker was just using the standard proof-of-work properties of a blockchain.

I oppose this move for several reasons. One is that there is not yet a standard method for signing a message with the private key of a bech32 address, thus proving ownership of that address. The bip for generic message signing (bip 322) is still being written. Until we have a standard way to sign messages with the private key of a bech32 address, I don't think we as an industry should drop support for legacy addresses. Also, I think segwit should remain optional, in the spirit of not forcing people to change to stuff if they don't want to.

That's not a consensus rule. All nodes will validate transactions that have lower fees than that if they appear in a block, but they may opt to ignore them when they only appear in the mempool. Some node operators set their nodes to relay low-fee and no-fee transactions even though most others don't; the nodes that do still remain nodes in good standing. Many transactions with low-fees or no-fees appear in every block.

Yes to your last question. It gets more expensive to mine because there is a limited supply per day. Only 1800 bitcoins are issued per day to miners. If you've got 18,000 computers mining for 1800 bitcoins, the difficulty adjusts so that 1 in 10 computers will get one. If someone wants to increase their chances they can buy more computers, which is expensive, but then they've got a better shot at mining one of the 1800 available each day. If some rich guy bought 162,000 more computers and set them all mining, he would increase his chances of mining a lot of bitcoins. But also, the network would now see that there are 180,000 computers mining for 1800 bitcoins, so it would adjust the difficulty again so that only 1 in 100 computers will get one.

0-conf payments are insecure compared to confirmed payments, but in order to double-spend them there's a significant amount of manual tinkering that goes into it, and even if you did that tinkering, the chance of your double-spend being successful is not 100% -- it's more like 20%. This makes some merchants comfortable with accepting 0-conf payments for small purchases, because who's going to go through the trouble of setting up a double-spend if the purchase is small? If your time is worth anything, it will cost you more to set up a fraudulent double-spend than it's worth.
As a consequence of this and other considerations, many merchants are okay with accepting 0-conf payments as long as the value is low. Once I even completed an instant $2000 transaction and got my product immediately, with no confirmations. I was surprised, and thought that was too high a value to allow such a thing, but it's up to the merchant and apparently they didn't think it would be a problem.

A good wallet should keep track of all your addresses without you having to consolidate them. If you use a decent wallet, no one can know which addresses are yours, other than the one they made their payment to (which should be fine, as they already know about that payment). There's no reason to consolidate all your payments in to one address because your wallet can keep track of all your addresses and show you the total balance, known to you alone.

Every other user makes that choice by choosing what software to use. Wallet makers play an admittedly big role in this, because most users don't entirely know how their wallet works or what code it's running, but as long as it can send and receive payments from most everyone else, people are happy. Wallet devs can technically put in any code they want -- but if it doesn't work with most everyone else's wallets, they will lose users. So it's ultimately the users who decide, by deciding what wallets to use -- though wallet-designers play a crucial role too.

Your description is not wrong for ordinary transactions, but for this particular double-spend to go through, the double-spend can't go into the mempool -- it has to be given to a miner via some other method (such as emailing him the tx info), and then he has to put it into his block directly, bypassing the mempool. Then he has to find proof-of-work for that block, succeed before anyone else gets a block in, and then he'd be done -- he'd have caused an inflationary chainsplit, because some bitcoin nodes would accept the faulty block (those with the CVE bug), and others would reject it (those without the CVE bug).

I say this as someone who opposes this "force everyone to use segwit" push, but this particular objection re: cold storage is invalid, iiuc. Even if everyone upgrades to bech32 and drops support for legacy addresses, it will still be possible to manually craft a transaction that sends coins from a legacy address to a bech32 address. Using a bitcoin core client of version 0.16.x would make this particularly easy. All you have to do is fulfill the script conditions, and future clients are very unlikely to get rid of the scripts that make sending from a legacy address work; even if they stop allowing you to *create* legacy addresses, it would be much harder work to get rid of the scripts that are commonly in use with legacy addresses. So legacy coins are safe despite this push, which, I repeat, I oppose.
(And, to be clearer still, if a developer wants to create a bech32-only wallet, I say go for it. Just don't try to force everyone else to do so too.)

Awesome! By exploring your app I found out that it's pretty easy to set up a custodial Lightning wallet on Open Node. I've never done that before, so for me it was like discovering a new lightning wallet. Their service is pretty slick, and you've added some neat features. It's easy to link your app to the Open Node service, even for a noob like me who's never used either service before, and I particularly like that you added an option to pay each invoice using a standard btc address in case a lightning payment doesn't work. Is that something provided for in the Open Node api, or did you manage that using some other service?
The only two things I could complain about regarding Open Node -- and this isn't a complaint about your app, btw, which is both cool-looking and easy to set up -- is, first, they are a custodial service (meaning there's a risk of theft and loss of tx privacy), and second, they require you to use an email address to create an account (which could leak personal information, another privacy risk). However, it's not that hard to create a fresh email address if you don't want to give Open Node any chance to obtain your personal info, so that mitigates my second issue; and, regarding them being custodial, they allow you to withdraw your funds to your lightning wallet or your onchain wallet at any time, and this option reduces the custodial risk. (Plus they have an option to do one weekly scheduled onchain withdrawal every Monday for no fees.)
In sum, as long as you're comfortable with giving up the tx privacy benefits that Lightning provides, while being savvy enough to withdraw your funds regularly, this should be a low-risk gateway to receiving lightning payments; and, your app provides a supplemental value by making it easy to receive onchain payments too, in case a lightning payment doesn't work.
I like it! Good job.

There is a serious problem with this analogy. The lightning network uses actual bitcoin addresses and actual bitcoins, and its contracts use standard bitcoin smart contract functions enforced in the standard way by the standard bitcoin blockchain. (Standard standard standard.) It's not "LN-tokens backed by bitcoins" anymore than the Panama Canal is "Panama liquid backed by water." Lightning payments exchange real bitcoin payment information.
This is a better analogy: lightning payments are like money orders, except instead of being backed by a company, they are backed by the blockchain. So you can send someone one of these money orders (a lightning payment) and, with that, at any time and with no chance of failure they can move the specified number of bitcoins to their address on the blockchain whenever they want. This feature makes these "money orders" as good as moving the actual bitcoins, because they are enforced using the same blockchain with no chance of failure. Oh yeah and these "money orders" have no expiration date, and once you're in possession of one you can send the amount on it to someone else, or even send a greater amount, so long as you have enough bitcoins in your address to back up the difference.

Agreed. I am quite sure there will be multiple currencies, because they are so easy to create now. I think there is even some utility in inflationary cryptocurrencies. For example, at some point I think we will see inflationary cryptocurrencies widely deployed as a replacement for the things we currently call "reward points" and "frequent flyer points." I think these will eventually be replaced by inflationary cryptocurrencies run by corporations, and they will be useful economic tokens precisely because they will spur people to engage in economic activity even during times of economic hardship while they are saving their bitcoins.

You save in either direction, legacy to Segwit or Segwit to legacy.

Miners must execute these script instructions in order to process the transaction and get the fee, so they are happy to do so in either direction.

(A) The not so tech savvy majority already distrusts bitcoin
(B) The not so tech savvy shouldn't even notice -- it's all on the backend. How many not so tech savvy people even watch new blocks come in to see what bips the miners voted on in the metadata, let alone check what algorithm miners are running these days? 
(C) Changing the algorithm shouldn't reduce trust if the whole network of users does it by consensus to protect their money; they would only do that if the 51% people were doing something bad


(D) We have no problem with Bitmain like companies. Only if they successfully do something bad do we have a problem. And if they do successfully do something bad, and we kick their hardware off the network in response, the next people to pop up will likely not be so hasty to try something bad -- because that's a lot of money down the drain
(E) The company to arise if we did this would likely be Bitmain themselves; it would take them a while to manufacture new machines with a new algorithm, but they could do it quicker than anyone else because they already have the infrastructure in place to manufacture new, upgraded machines relatively quickly. But see D -- since their original attack would have costed them so much in terms of lost hardware, they'd be unlikely to try to attack again

The proposal is to have a text messenger where all the messages are encrypted and stored on a public blockchain. The sending device would encrypt the message, store it on the blockchain, and then the recipient device would download the message and decrypt it.
I see several drawbacks to this idea.
Number 1. Storing data in a secure public blockchain is very expensive. Imagine you had to pay 10 cents for every message.
Number 2. The recipient device has to have decryption keys to decrypt the message. If these keys are the same for every message, then it seems that all sending devices have to know what that key is, so that they can put messages on the blockchain that are encrypted with the same keys the other ones are. If that's how this works, then it seems that anyone could decrypt any message, because all the encrypted messages are stored on a public blockchain and they all use the same keys, which everyone has. If these keys are not the same for every message, then the sender and the receiver have to find some way to agree on a common key, or the sender has to share a decryption key with the receiver so he can decrypt the message; are there proposals to do that in a way where the key is unlikely to be intercepted?
Number 3. The recipient device has to have some way to know which messages on the blockchain are intended for it. That part of the message either must not be encrypted (because if it was encrypted then it's part of the data that the recipient doesn't know it's supposed to receive) or it needs to be encrypted in a way that the recipient device can recognize as "that's for me." Are there proposals to do that in a way that protects the recipient's privacy?
Related to number 2 -- suppose the sender thinks he has found a method to send a decryption key to the receiver without the key getting intercepted. In that case, why doesn't he just send the whole message using the same method? If his goal is to send private messages, and he's found a method to send a key privately, then just use that method to send the whole message privately, which moots the need for a blockchain.

When you buy from an exchange you are buying from bitcoin sellers on that exchange. If there isn't a seller offering $1000 worth of bitcoins at the spot price, you'll get what he has, but you'll have to purchase the remainder from the next best offer, which will be slightly higher, and possibly the next, and the next after that, as needed. The result is that the more bitcoins you purchase, the more you pay above the spot price. Your 1.3% figure seems reasonable in that light.

No, it's just a clever way to exchange guaranteed payment contracts on bitcoin's blockchain in a fast and cheap way.


It might be $5000 in a couple years time, but right now it's $6.72. If the price increases to a point where 100000 satoshis is too much to have on your device, you can take some out. (See my next point.)


Sure you can, just use the "send" button in the lower right corner. Using that, you can send your funds to any wallet you want -- the recipient doesn't even have to have a lightning wallet.


The private key is in the 12 or 24 words you wrote down when you created the wallet. All your addresses and private keys can be managed using that 12 or 24 word restoration key. You can even import your funds into another wallet using that.


Eclair uses multisig addresses and segwit addressses, both of which start with a 3. If you want to learn how these technologies work before using them, you're welcome to; I can recommend books such as Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antanopoulos as a good place to start. But there's no requirement that you understand them to use them -- they're just bitcoin addresses, you send money to them and boom, you've got money in your lightning wallet.


Right now a lot of the lightning stuff has to be done manually, so it's aimed toward nerds. Eventually we'll automate a lot of that or design wallets that handle the tricky parts on the backend, and those will be easier for laymen. In between those two extremes, it will vary -- we'll gradually shift toward laymen, but it won't happen all at once. Some nerdy parts of lightning will be nerdy for a while yet, and require manual handling. But eventually it'll get easier.


Both are good goals. I hope this post was helpful. Welcome to lightning!

Presumably you're referring to the TenX card, right? I don't believe it is currently possible to make an open source version of the TenX card. It's a prepaid Visa debit card, so Visa (or Mastercard or a competitor) would have to authorize it. And that requires centralization around a single codebase, because they're not going to sign off on anything that Tom, Dick, or Larry writes, they are only going to sign off on code that they've reviewed and approved of. I suppose we could try to come up with an open-source version of Visa too, like a "Visa Open Source," and encourage a payment processor to accept that in addition to Visa and Mastercard, but there are several problems with that: (1) in order to process USD for businesses you have to have a money transmitter license, and the government will only grant that to a business or an individual, which means centralization; and (2) An open source payment processor is already what BTCPay is, so we can just try to get merchants to adopt that and skip the VISA/USD middleman.

~~A watchtower could close a channel by broadcasting a contract at the wrong time, and if one started doing that, people wouldn't use it.~~ EDIT: see the post below for clarification. Watchtowers can't close channels.
Also, if a watchtower sees an old contract enter the mempool, that old contract is the thing that initiates the channel closure, not the watchtower.
It may be helpful for you to know that all lightning contracts that are broadcast to the mempool are channel closing contracts. If the contract is invalid it can't be broadcast; ordinary nodes can verify whether or not the channel-closing contract is valid, but, assuming it's valid, they can't tell if it's the latest version or not. That's where watchtower nodes come in -- you can tell them the latest version of the contract, and they can watch the blockchain for you in case your node is offline. Then, if they see an old-but-still-valid contract enter the mempool, they'll broadcast the latest version of the contract for you.

Correct, you're not wrong. At the present time that is one of its many limitations.


Right now you have to manually rebalance your channels through some method, the easiest of which is to send some money to a swap provider (of which there are very few). When swap tech is finished, there will be ways to do it trustlessly, and almost as soon as that happens, someone will create a wallet that does it on the backend automatically. At that point, you'll no longer have to worry about rebalancing your channels, you won't even see it happening. But right now we're in early days and a lot of stuff that ought to be automated (and can be) has to be done manually. There are lots of opportunities in this space where the user experience is poor to create a solution, get users, and help the community.
Alternatively, you can just ask us to let you know when everything's ready. That's fine too; we'll have a party or something.
BTW -- rebalancing right now isn't hard, it takes about 10 minutes because it involves waiting for an onchain transaction. If you're a store with lightning integration, you're probably savvy enough about bitcoin to spend 10 minutes every now and then doing an onchain transaction to rebalance your channels.

Very good, and probably a tad faster than a debit card transaction if you have to type a pin number. It was still about 2 seconds slower than a standard credit card transaction, but it's in the same ballpark, and in both cases the speed depends on network conditions.

He's referring to various methods of batching transactions together, which can reduce inputs, outputs, and the number of transactions. For example, if 200 people did a batch purchase of bitcoins, someone would need to create a special transaction for them in which a relatively small number of bitcoins is sent in one transaction to all their wallets. You could, for example, take a wallet that has one whole bitcoin in it and send .005 of that to all 200 people in one transaction, with one mining fee. This would save space on the blockchain compared to 200 separate transactions, and it would allow a bunch of people to get onboarded to lightning all at once, and split the transaction fee.

Chain reorgs do "mute" (change) the data on the blockchain, and that particular chain reorg did too. The blockchain, btw, is designed to allow this form of mutability -- it's in the whitepaper: "[a] block cannot be changed without redoing the [proof-of-work]. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change [any] block...include[s] redoing all the blocks after it." (Section 4) 
See also this paragraph:


And this one:


In Section 11, Satoshi specifies that a chain reorganization can be used to "take back" (undo) a transaction, though the whitepaper assumes that this would only be done by an attacker trying to do a double-spend after a payment gets confirmed. (Satoshi therefore calls such a user an "attacker." In one of the above quotations, I changed "an attacker" to "[a user]" -- in brackets -- because a person or group doing a chain reorg is not necessarily attacking anyone, as demonstrated by the quote from Section 5 of the whitepaper.)
Regarding softforks, the fact that softforks can be done does not increase bitcoin's mutability. An analogy I've heard is this: imagine you worked at a company who required that everyone wear a tie. That's a rule that every employee is required to follow, similar to a consensus rule on the bitcoin network that all network nodes are required to follow. (E.g. "no more than 21 million coins.") Now, suppose some of the workers formed a club -- the Red Tie Club -- and anyone who wanted to join that club had to wear a red tie. Well, wearing a red tie is an additional restriction compared to the rule that everyone else at the company is following, but it's also not a violation of the company rule -- the company rule just says you've got to wear a tie, and members of the Red Tie Club are doing that. That's what a soft-fork is like: an additional restriction on bitcoin's rules. It doesn't break immutability because it keeps all the previous rules and just adds a new one.
Out of the overflow bug controversy a new softfork rule emerged -- a rule that said "We won't validate any transaction whose value gets overflowed." This didn't break the previous consensus rules because the previous rules never said you *had to* validate value-overflows. Some clients, newer ones at that time, *did* validate value-overflows, but no one said they had to, it's just that the thing that previously prevented them from validating value-overflow transactions got removed without anybody realizing it could cause a problem. When the softfork software started getting more use than the previous software, the new rule fixed this problem. Since this new rule was compatible with the previous set of rules, everyone was happy -- including the guy who found the bug and exploited it: his client accepted the proof-of-work done by the new software, and, once the chain with the new rule outgrew the overflow chain, a standard chain reorg happened, and the overflow transaction consequently got annulled. The softfork followed the bitcoin whitepaper: "the work to change [any] block...include[s] redoing all the blocks after it." (Section 4) We did that: we redid all the blocks subsequent to the one we changed, and everyone was happy.
If following the whitepaper counts as "not really immutable," just because the whitepaper allows one (difficult) way to change blocks -- then count me in that camp, because that's the way I want to do things.

Thank you for your very helpful reply. I am consistently not getting 50929B...803AC0 when I apply sha256 to 0479BE...10D4B8. For example, if I type that string into [this sha256 generator tool]( I get 024A8E...E3926B as the result. If I try to lowercase all the letters first, I get B3A373...65FEE7 as the result. I looked up a tool for turning hex into bytes, and it appears to simply insert a colon after every two digits, making it look like 04:79:BE:...10:D4:B8. But when I inserted the result into the sha256 tool with upper case letters, I get 97934F...D6A003 as the result, and if I use lower case letters, I get 75774E...75847F as the result.

Since transactions are flooded through peers, you may have plausible deniability if you can show that it is possible that your node was just broadcasting a transaction it received from one of your peers. But there are techniques a listening node can use to gain beyond-reasonable-doubt levels of confidence that it was your node and not one of your peers who first broadcasted the transaction. (E.g. if your node was just part of a larger flood and not the originating point, how come no one else sent me this transaction at that time?) The Dandelion Protocol hopes to solve this by changing from the flood model to one where nodes usually pass each transaction to just one other peer, but have a certain percentage chance of passing it to all their peers -- which makes it difficult for listeners to figure out if the node they're listening to was the original transactor, or part of a larger flood, or just seeding someone else's transaction to a single other peer.

If it wasn't, it would be very easy for third parties to make it work with bcash, because it works with litecoin's scripts, and all of litecoin's scripts are in bcash too. Submarine swaps are permissionless, anyone can make an app that allows this, so if it didn't have bcash support built in it would only be a matter of time. But in fact it does have bcash support built in, and that aspect is functioning on testnet.

Are you talking about signature verification? Like, send each address owner a message to sign, and if they sign it, that proves they still have control of that address? I ask because I'm not sure what other method there is to verify an address. But if you do mean the signature verification method, suppose you send a message out saying "We think the following 10000 addresses contain lost bitcoins; if you own one of these addresses please use the private key to sign this message: These bitcoins aren't lost." Once you did that, let's suppose you got as many as 1000 signed messages back; that still wouldn't prove that the other 9000 addresses contain lost coins. Maybe their owners just didn't see the message or didn't want to participate. I don't think there is a "proof of lost coins" method -- and without one, there's no way to know if a coin is lost or not, other than the very few coins that have been sent to provably invalid burn addresses.

The public key is obtained by performing the following elliptic curve multiplication equation: (private key * generator point = public key). Be aware that the * does not represent ordinary multiplication, but elliptic curve multiplication. This involves a lot of doubling and adding, but you already know about that in general, so let's use your specific example: if your private key is 1, you'll need to write it with a bunch of preceding 0s so that it represents a 64 digit number. I.e. 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001. (It might be a 256 digit number -- I forget.)
Next, you'll be using the following list of equations. You'll notice that, ordinarily, the step we're about to do involves repeatedly doubling the generator point G, but in your case, it won't. We'll see why next after I post the ordinary column of equations we need to use.
Keep doing that until you've got 64 lines. (It might be 256 lines -- I forget.)
Next, write the bits of the private key next to this list, such that the 1, which is the last digit of your private key, is next to the top line of the column -- like this:
1 1*G 
0 2*G 
0 4*G 
0 8*G 
0 16*G 
0 32*G 
0 64*G
0 128*G
Keep doing that for all 64 lines (maybe 256 lines -- I forget), putting a zero next to each line. (If you had an ordinary private key, the digits wouldn't all be zeroes, but you chose a private key of 1, so there's only one 1 in your private key -- the last digit, which goes at the top of the column -- while all the other digits are zeroes.)
This is the part where the "adding and multiplying" comes in, the part that everyone dreads. Do the adding first. You need to add the lines of the column together, one line after the next, but only those lines which have a 1 written next to them. I.e. in the case of private key 1, the top line will get added to nothing. You'll be left with 1*G as the only thing that needs multiplying. The rest of the lines all have zeroes next to them, so they don't get multiplied.
Let me put this another way to make it more clear. Since you've only got one line, you just have to add the solution of (1 * G) to nothing; there are no further lines to add to that first line. But if you had had a 1 next to the first line and a 1 next to the (8 * G) line, for example, you would have added (1 * G) to (8 * G), and obtained (9 * G); then, you'd look for the next line that has a 1 next to it, and add (9 * G) to that line. E.g. the next one might be (32 * G), in which case you'd add (9 * G) to (32 * G), and obtain (41 * G). At the end of all that you'd multiply a relatively large number times G, but you don't have to do that because you chose to use the simplest possible private key, 1, so you'll just multiply (1 * G).
Therefore, you'll end up with a public key that matches the generator point. The generator point, in hexadecimal, happens to be 0479BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798483ADA7726A3C4655DA4FBFC0E1108A8FD17B448A68554199C47D08FFB10D4B8. That's your public key.
Your next step is to turn that into a bitcoin address. 
The equation you want for this part begins like this: (RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))), where K is the hexadecimal string beginning with 04 and ending with B8. This will give you a Public Key Hash, which should be 20 bytes, i.e. 160 bits. Be aware that most of the RIPEMD160 and SHA256 tools you’ll find online won’t work for this, because most of them hash the hex codes of your number rather than the bytecodes. What I mean is, when most of those online tools see the first 0 in the number that starts with 04, what they’ll do is they’ll assume you’re typing using the ascii format, and thus that you actually want to hash the ascii value of that number. So they’ll look up 0 in an ascii table, and find that its ascii value is 30. Thus they’ll hash the number 30 instead of 0, which is not what you want. You’ll need to use a RIPEMD160 tool and a SHA256 tool that hash your number without looking up the ascii values of each digit; in other words, you'll need a RIPEMD160 tool and a SHA256 tool that takes each pair of digits as a bytecode. One tool that does this, for both RIPEMD160 and SHA256, is this one:  -- make sure to type your 0479BE...10D4B8 number into the “Binary hash” field instead of the “String hash” field.
When you do that, scroll down and you’ll see that the SHA256 value for the above number, when hashed as bytes, is 50929b...803ac0. Take that number and copy-paste it into the binary hash field again, and look down below for the RIPEMD160 result, which is 91b24b...1d28a5. 
You’ll next want to take that number and turn it into a base58check bitcoin address. Start this section by prefixing 00 to the number, which represents the initial 1 in a standard bitcoin address. The result should look like this: 0091b2...1d28a5. Next we’ll append a checksum to that, so let's start that process.
We can obtain the checksum using this equation: (SHA256(SHA256(prefix+data))) So take 0091b2...1d28a5 and type that into the binary hash field from the above tool, and the result you’ll get is 79fa92...80b44f. Do it a second time (bitcoin uses a lot of double hashing), and you’ll get 0074ff...989170. 
The first four bytes of that are the first eight digits, i.e. 0074ffe0. Append that onto the 0091b2...1d28a5 number, so that the resulting number should look like this: 0091b24bf9f5288532960ac687abb035127b1d28a50074ffe0. Now, turn that into base58 encoding. You can use this free online tool for that:  The resulting bitcoin address is 1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm.

Indeed you can, even on bch. [Here's a website]( -- created by bch devs -- to track 0-conf transactions that got double-spent on bch. Check the fee amounts to see that successful double-spends often follow the simple model of "set a low fee for the payment you want to fail, then set a higher fee for the payment you want to go through."
What the RBF upgrade did in bitcoin was, it put a button in the interface to do a double-spend that increases the fee, and made it so that all nodes by default will share double-spends with other nodes as long as the replacement fee is higher than the original fee. Bch removed the button and removed the autosharing of doublespends. But some bch nodes, such as BitcoinXT, share doublespends anyway to help track them, and even if you're not connected to a BitcoinXT node, you can just send the doublespend payment directly to a miner. They are valid transactions according to the software, thus the miners are free to process them if they want. And as you can see from the doublespend website, miners often do process the doublespend transaction, especially if it pays them a higher fee. Thus 0-conf payments are insecure -- but merchants can accept them if they want, and some do, even on btc, for the reasons I mentioned in my last post.

No, I don't think it's for nothing. 


Maybe so, maybe so. There is probably some pressure being put on large, identifiable exchanges to do coin analytics and censoring. But they have competitors who are using crypto's abilities (and the internet's) to make it very hard to find the exchange operators and put pressure on them. I don't think shapeshift is doing any censoring or coin analytics, and they are a very large exchange whose operators seem to have taken steps to preserve their privacy. As submarine swaps become integrated into wallets and people start adding liquidity to do currency swaps on the fly, we'll have an even more decentralized way to exchange private coins. The more the blockchain economy grows, the more I think it will become apparent that the companies coming out on top are the ones who respect their users' privacy and don't restrict private coins. Companies and services which limit your freedom -- even at the government's request -- will simply not be able to compete with companies and services which do not limit your freedom -- or anyway that's what I think.

People also misunderstand what "upgrading to segwit" signifies. All of the benefits that come from using segwit are personal benefits that are available regardless of how many people are using it. Even if only 1% of people were using segwit, you could still build the lightning network, do atomic swaps, perform chained transactions, and take advantage of the segwit discount. None of those things depend on more people using segwit. Individual segwit-users thus do not gain any more benefits when additional people use segwit. Only the new users get the new benefits. We're not waiting with baited breath for more people to adopt segwit so that we can do more stuff -- segwit is an option now, so we can build whatever we want with it right now. Thus we're not waiting for people to adopt, we're just building useful products and letting people start using them as they see fit. (The result is called "organic growth.")
Moreover, segwit and legacy addresses have different purposes. When you decide to use an address with segwit, there's a tradeoff that has to be taken into consideration, because there are benefits that are exclusive to legacy addresses. For example, I'm not aware of any segwit-supporting wallet that lets you verify your ownership of a segwit address by signing a message. Neither bech32 addresses nor p2sh addresses appear to have any wallets that support message-signing. There are people for whom the ability to sign a message with your private key, and thus prove your ownership of an address without compromising its security, is a critical feature, and, afaik, it is only available to users of legacy addresses. Those who have to show proof of ownership might prefer to use a legacy address for that reason alone.
Consequently, and very rightly, segwit usage will never be 100%. There are use-cases for which legacy addresses are the superior choice. They may be slightly more expensive for onchain transactions, and they may not support lightning transactions, but those aren't the only things bitcoin is for, and for some of the things bitcoin is useful for, legacy addresses are superior to segwit addresses.

Thank you, I concede the point.


I agree. Conveniently, fiat currencies are currently engaged in a "race to the bottom" regarding their purchasing power, and very large countries are beginning to feel the effects of this race as bitcoin's purchasing power continues to increase. Venezuela's laughable attempt to make their own bitcoin is perhaps the best proof that at least one big country has realized the threat bitcoin poses to their control over the financial system. The value of crypto, relative to fiat currencies, goes up more and more every time they intentionally lower their own currency's purchasing power. If this trend continues, we may not need fiat onramps -- a substantial part of world economic activity appears to be moving onto the blockchain, and in that space, bitcoin is not participating in the race to the bottom that is happening among fiat currencies. Hyperbitcoinization may be happening slower than some think, but I think it is happening, and I'm grateful.

You are a little bit confused, but imo it's not that much. LND is the github you linked to. That is one company's lightning wallet. I think it is version 0.42 right now, and I believe their roadmap puts that particular wallet out of beta (i.e. at version 1.0) before the end of next year. There are other wallets that consider themselves further along in development -- for example, c-lightning is at version 0.6 right now, and it, too, will be officially out of beta when it hits version 1.0. But all of that is up to the wallet makers -- the lightning network itself is the result of lightning wallets being connected to each other, and it's not in beta, it's something that "just exists" -- it's what happens when you connect lightning wallets together.
Various wallets should improve the experience as their designers "finish them," but other wallet makers will continue making new wallets with new user experiences and new features, and so there will probably be lightning wallets in various states of completion (including beta) for a very long time. The wallet makers decide that -- but the network itself already exists, i.e. lightning wallets (in various states of completion) are already connected to one another and they work. Most of them are beta wallets, but I don't think all of them are.

Here's another gem:


Sounds like he has some personal issues on the backburner. And in fact, he's wrong -- we are quite comfortable with increasing the blocksize once the software has efficiently made use of our current block size. But current blocks are barely more than 1 megabyte, and they have up to 2.5 megabytes of space (with segwit) before they hit capacity. Moreover, before that happens, Schnorr + Mast will decrease the bytes per transaction and thus allow more transactions per block on the base layer. Also, lightning wallets are growing in popularity, and with those, bitcoin payments don't take up any space in the blockchain, which gives bitcoin immeasurably high transaction capacity. So give us a minute -- eventually we'll increase the blocksize somewhat, but not now, it's too early.

Thank you. This byte-reversal trick is giving me some progress. Originally, when I did RIPEMD160 on the SHA256 that Kimbatt told me is the right one (i.e. 50929B...803AC0, the one I am having trouble getting), I got 0ca280...2a5597 as the result -- which is not what I was supposed to get. But after trying your byte reversal trick, I typed C03A80...9B9250 into the RIPEMD160 tool, and I got 92bfd4...d6c330 as the result, which is indeed what I am supposed to get. Yay! Byte-reversal seems to work, at least for the RIPEMD160 part.
However, I still haven't gotten it to work with the SHA256 part. I turned the hex string into reverse-byte order (B8:D4:10...BE:79:04) and removed the semicolons, but the resulting sha256 was 0F94D5...9DFA8B -- still not what I'm looking for. I also tried keeping the colons in there, but I got 5E4ABE...FE3C58 -- again, not what I'm looking for, which is supposed to be 50929B...803AC0. Any suggestions?

I tried turning the hexadecimal representation into a binary string, but it still didn't work. The tool appears to be seeing all my 0s as 30s and all my 1s as 31s, apparently because of something to do with the ascii chart and how it says 30 is the hex code for 0 and 31 is the hex code for 1.
I don't know how to get my sha256 tool to interpret the 0s and 1s simply as 0s and 1s, and I suppose I should just use a different tool. Kimbatt linked me to one that lets me tell it not to read the string in terms of each character's hex code, and that one spits out the right output, so I guess that's a solution right there: find the right tool for the job. Still, I would like to know if there is a way to force a sha256 tool to read 1s and 0s as 1s and 0s even if it is programmed to read their hex codes. (Why would the programmer set it up that way anyway?)

Yes, you can, and that will indeed be a much faster way to do it, though there is a tradeoff: by putting someone else's copy of the blockchain into your node, you're trusting someone, and skipping the the self-verifying part. Your node will only validate blocks that come after the part you downloaded. Anyway, assuming you still want to to this, download the blockchain from bittorrent and (when you get up next morning) go into the correct folder, remove the blockchain file that's in there, and replace it with the bittorrent one you just downloaded. Assuming you're using Windows 7 or higher, the blockchain file is called blk*.dat (the star represents a variable number) and the folder you'll want to put it in is: C:\Users\ **\[YourUserName\]** \Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin\blocks
Good luck!

I wonder what they'll call the split coin on exchanges. Bcash Cash (BCC)? It might work since Bitconnect is no longer relevant, so the BCC ticker is up for grabs. CraigCoin Unlimited (CCU)? Satoshi's Vision Coin (SVC)? Professor Faustus's Flop Token (PFFT)? There's so many options!
Maybe SV coin will have a bigger market cap than bch, so it will get that ticker, and then Ver can change the current bch's name to "Lonely Millionaire's Club" (LMC).

Merchants are perfectly allowed to accept anything they want as payment. Bartering is not illegal in the United States. The dealer who owns the car could give it to you in exchange for 3000 "free haircut" coupons if he wanted. He can also give you the car for btc. US law allows an owner to sell his product for any form of payment he is willing to accept, including property.
Also, just because US law counts btc as a form of property for tax purposes doesn't mean that's what it is in reality. They had to put it into a legal category and they thought that one made the most sense. I think they should have put it into the category of foreign currency like England did, but to some extent it's semantics. (Besides, isn't your currency your property? It belongs to you, right?)

Neither. In its simplest form, a watchtower is a program that watches the blockchain to see when a particular transaction is broadcast to the mempool. If that transaction is flagged in it's memory as part of an outdated contract, it broadcasts the latest version of the contract it knows about. They have no control of funds. They don't need ID about their users or where the funds are destined for. They are simple tools for identifying old contracts that somehow get broadcasted, and replacing them with the latest versions.

21 million is an approximation, the real value is the result of a math equation. Satoshi started with an initial block reward of 50 bitcoins, which is a nice round number. That reward is given out every 10 minutes, and cuts in half every 4 years -- both of which are nice round numbers. (They were also chosen for technical reasons -- 10 minutes is a decent amount of time to allow the whole network worldwide to process each block, and 4 is a power of 2, which scales up easily when using binary logic, like computers do.)
Given these initial conditions, the result is that after about 132 years, the software hands out a mere satoshi per block, and needs to divide again -- but it can't, because Satoshi only gave the system 8 decimal places, which is, again, a nice round number (and another power of 2). It's at that point that it stops giving out bitcoins, and, seemingly by coincidence, the amount of bitcoins on the blockchain at that time will be just under 21 million.
In fact if you look up the actual value, it's not a nice round number, it's 20,999,999.97690000. We just round up when talking about it because it's close to 21 million. The fact that it's a weird number in the high 20-millions is actually evidence that it wasn't deliberately chosen -- it's the only number in the equation that isn't a nice, clean, round number.

I agree, but I will point out that many bitcoin wallets have reached 1.0 status even though the Core reference client has not. As you said, it is entirely up to the devs. I think that the rapidity of development on the lightning projects is evidence that they will get out of beta soon, but I think it is perfectly defensible for you to think otherwise. You might, for instance, point out that Core too has received a record-breaking amount of peer-reviewed input in recent months -- and yet it is only a little closer to 1.0. But I still think the lightning wallets are moving relatively faster through the 0.x zones. (On that front LND and C-lightning are both far ahead of Core -- I'm not implying that the number reflects code quality, only that it usually signifies the developer's intentions regarding when to release the product, and thus these projects, which have gone from 0.0 to 0.4 and 0.6 in only a couple of years are likely to be released rather soon in comparison to Core, which has taken almost 10 years and is still not at 0.2.)
Of course, even if some wallets get out of beta rather soon, that does not by itself determine how usable the network is. But I think it will be a good symbolic indicator when one of the three big lightning wallets gets out of beta. I think their attitude toward their wallets overlaps with their attitude about the overall network, and if/when they decide that their wallets are good enough to call 1.0, there's something symbolic about that which probably means they think the network is good enough too.

Helpfully, it's soft forkable. You can design the code so that unupdated nodes will see sighash_noinput payments as anyone-can-spend but still valid, just like how segwit worked, but updated nodes (i.e. the majority) will know that they are not anyone-can-spend but are signed, except for the inputs part.

Bitcoin has the biggest and most secure blockchain, but there are plenty of nonbitcoin blockchains.
I would also add to the first reply by saying that blockchain, cryptography, and proof of work are not the only essential components of the bitcoin protocol. Node decentralization and a cap on coin issuance are two other essential components.

Bitcoin can do a smart contract where the only payment (not counting change sent back to yourself) is the part that pays the miners. Op_return is a proof of concept for this, where you pay the miners to add a piece of arbitrary data to the blockchain, and no one else gets paid. You can do the same thing with bitcoin smart contracts on lightning or on the blockchain. But bitcoin contracts can't do instruction recursion like ethereum contracts can, and bitcoin contracts have a size limit that ethereum contracts don't have. That is why most bitcoin smart contracts involve off-chain computation by a server paid for by the developer; doing the heavy lifting off-chain allows the app to be as large as an ethereum contract and faster, but at the expense of being under the developer's control -- and therefore censorable. The new tools for LApp development bring more optimization to bitcoin smart contracts, but the Solidity language still has some advantages.
Btw cryptokitties *cannot* be completely implemented on the bitcoin blockchain, not even with the new lapp tools, because the creation of new cryptokitties relies upon instruction recursion -- i.e. code that is written once and then reused multiple times, as many times as someone is willing to pay for it. Bitcoin smart contracts are unable to do that by design. In bitcoin you could probably make a total of 50 cryptokitties in one contract -- after that you'd have to restart the contract from scratch and the network would treat it as a different instance of the program with an all new Kittie  Kittie  etc. You Could implement cryptokitties as a Partially onchain app, with the recursive stuff done on a second layer and the payments done onchain (or on lightning). But if you wanted the whole thing to be onchain bitcoin couldn't do it (though the Rootstock sidechain could).

It was a scaling solution because it increased the blocksize to a theoretical maximum of ~3.9 megabytes and made it safe for bitcoin apps to indefinitely store bitcoins using smart contracts. Some apps (e.g. lightning wallets) can use this new security protection to introduce additional scaling options via the exchange of payment info in a similar manner to how an electronic check works. Moreover, it is now possible to manage bitcoin signatures independently of the contract data and transaction information, including by signature aggregation, which promises to give us additional ways to maximize the use of space on the blockchain. All of these are scaling improvements.
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:25:25
It is important to point out that Taproot only masks unused scripts -- the ones that get used are made visible on the blockchain, and so, when you pay someone some money using an onchain transaction, even if you are using Taproot the info still goes on the blockchain. It's just that no one can tell if there was some other script in the code that didn't get used -- perhaps representing an alternative method of payment.
One possible application for this privacy boost is, I think, making lightning addresses indistinguishible from normal addresses. That is, it might be possible to use this so that no one can tell if an address is a lightning address, because lightning addresses use complicated scripts that rarely get fully used, and all of their complexity could be masked and made to look like a simple peer-to-peer transaction. I'm not sure how to best take advantage of Taproot's privacy features, but masking your lightning addresses to make them look like ordinary addresses might be one way to use it.

It may be that some exchanges don't put monero on there because they find that it makes KYC/AML difficult. But I wouldn't be surprised if the exchanges who do put monero on there have more volume. Either way, KYC/AML doesn't Require you to only accept traceable currencies. It requires you to know who your customer is and, if they try to move an amount of money greater than $5k, require them to report the source of the funds first. Exchanges can do both of those things with monero, and I suspect that the reason some exchanges don't include monero may have more to do with its reputation than any perceived inability to do KYC/AML.

As a lightning node you're competing with other nodes to get bitcoin users to route payments through your node. In order to be useful to users, you need to open channels with services that are frequently used, such as Satoshi's Place and Bitrefill, and set your routing fees competitively compared to other node operators. (I doubt Zap Wallet has a configuration for this, as it's intended for spenders, not routers. You may have to use the underlying daemon to configure this -- I think Zap comes with LND included but it might be Eclair Desktop or C-Lightning.)
Also, you'll need to let people know, e.g. on Reddit and Twitter, that you are a well-connected node offering cheap routing to the most frequently used destinations and invite them to open a channel to you to try you out. Then post your node's pubkey so that people can connect to you. Also, make sure your node is always online, because if it goes offline people won't be able to make payments through you.
The amount you put in each channel to a popular destination should be between $25 and $100. People aren't spending much more than that on lightning right now.
The amount of money you make depends on two factors: how many payments do you route and what do you charge. The second thing is what you can configure using the daemon that comes with Zap; getting people to notice you is the hard part. If your node is reliable and a cheap source of routing compared to others, people will use it! Let them know how to connect with you by sharing your pubkey

Whenever you make a payment, you create "incoming capacity" on your channel. Thus, people can pay you via your outbound channel, once you've made a few payments yourself. Also, you can create a channel with the node called "WillConnectBack," and they'll create a channel to your node; or you can make an outbound payment to a swap provider such as Lightning Conductor, who will send your coins back to you onchain; or, if people want your product and don't yet have a channel to you, they'll create one. All of these methods bring you inbound capacity.

In my opinion, it makes them quite similar to a third party like PayPal. There are services where you can buy things with bitcoin where there is no chance of chargebacks or any option for dispute resolution; there are also services where you can buy stuff with no option for dispute resolution.

I'm grateful for a payment platform upon which this is a real choice.

You don't need p2sh or bech32 addresses to send someone a payment and send them the witness data separately. You only need them if you want that payment to be secure -- i.e. spendable only by the recipient. The whole reason segwit worked as a soft fork is because you could already send people payments without the witness data being directly attached to the other payment info in the usual field. Before the softfork you could do this -- i.e. send a payment without witness data in the normal field to a normal address starting with 1 -- and you still can do so if you want -- but doing so made each segwit payment sent to a normal address spendable by anyone. But the softfork fixed that if you choose to use p2sh addresses or bech32 addresses. So it's safer now, but it was doable before if you were willing to sacrifice security.


You're not forced. Plenty of people run bitcoin without the segwit upgrade. If you want the segwit data, then you have the option of upgrading to segwit, or you can just download it separately without modifying your client. If you don't want the segwit data, no one is forcing you to download it or modify your client. It all still works just the way it used to without downloading anything related to segwit.


Do you mean your node will still download arbitrary op_return data even if you don't run a node that supports op_return? Do you think op_return data "doesn't count" as part of the transaction, and therefore if you don't receive that data, you still receive the whole block? I don't think that's what you mean, but if it is, why wouldn't the same reasoning apply to segwit data?

I'm sorry for making so many errors; I was referring to the paragraph in [the transcription]( that is labelled "scantxoutset RPC method." It includes these remarks, which, to me, seem equivalent to my description:


I assumed the scantxoutset method "specifies a key, address or a script" by posting it to a peer in order to get that info, since it doesn't have the full blockchain downloaded yet. I now infer that I was mistaken, and that's not what happens. It also says "then you can either sign or do whatever you want," which is what made me think it is possible to manage your coins with the utxo info which (I supposed) you got from your peers. Sorry for misunderstanding; could you clarify what I got wrong?
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:01:42

Changes to bitcoin can't be easily rolled back. If you mean "get 32 mb blocks now and then go back to smaller blocks later" -- (I don't think that's what you mean btw, but if it is) -- it can't work because almost all changes to bitcoin have to be backwards compatible. Once you allow miners to do 32 mb blocks you can never take it back without their consent (that's what consensus means) and they will almost surely never agree to roll it back because bigger blocks are more profitable than smaller blocks.
As a result, you "waste an upgrade." Bitcoin upgrades are hard to do because you can basically never roll them back to put in better code. All Bitcoin solutions have to be long term. Once they are in the network, they are there basically forever.
Eventually we plan to implement bigger blocks. Actually we did implement significantly bigger blocks recently -- segwit created the possibility for up to ~3.9 mb blocks, and if it ever hits close to 100% adoption blocks should regularly be between 2 and 3 megabytes. And like other upgrades, it can almost never be reversed due to the near immutability of the bitcoin blockchain. That's why we don't want to "waste" upgrades. When we have lots of other upgrades to put in at the same time, we'll implement bigger blocks as needed. But bitcoin isn't ready for that yet because important technologies for scaling up and remaining decentralized are not yet in place.

I don't think it's simpler to pay USD. If you use a credit card or PayPal, you're putting it through a middle man who takes a considerable chunk in fees. And you have to store that money in some institution which is probably making your money a part of a debt creation scheme. Moreover, if/when your card expires you can expect a call from the place you're making payments to, asking you for a new number, which costs both of you time and money. Or your card number might get stolen, leading you to have to rearrange all your recurring payments, or you might need to switch banks. USD is a very complicated way to send value. I would appreciate switching it for the simplicity of bitcoin.

It's a burn address. The maker can't spend from it because he doesn't have the private key to it, as it's name indicates. It's not hard to make a bitcoin address that has that many words in it, the hard thing is generating the private key for it so you can spend from it. Because there is no known private key for this address, and no known way to generate one, any coins that go there are effectively burned -- lost forever.

There are several problems with this idea. One of them is: there is no way to identify lost coins. The estimates are all speculative and many are just because someone said "Yeah I lost 256,000 bitcoins by throwing away my old hard drive," which is not verifiable testimony. Another method is to calculate how many bitcoins haven't "moved" in a large amount of time, such as 4 years, 6 years, or 8 years. But this assumes that all or most "live" bitcoins must have moved during that time, whereas it may be that the owners are just saving their money.

There is already a way to dispense with $5 wrench attacks using multisig. Put your savings in a 2-of-3 multisig wallet. Keep one signature with your hot wallet, one in a physical time capsule buried in a field somewhere, and the third in a digital time capsule. The physical time capsule is a backup in case your digital time capsule fails; make it hard to get to, something that would take longer than a month to dig up. (Like, have your dog bury it in a field, but don't watch to see exactly where in that field he buries it. That way you'll have to dig up the whole field to find it.)
Your digital time capsule is set to very briefly allow you to view its private key once a month. Moreover, during that window of time you have to use its private key to sign a particular message, otherwise your "savings wallet" will automatically send your coins to some other wallet of your choosing.
With this scheme, you can only access your savings once a month, or else dig up a whole field. If someone does a wrench-attack on you, it won't work because you are truly unable to give them access to your savings except once a month. You can give them your hot wallet's private key, but it's not enough by itself; you can additionally give them the location of the field, but since it will take them longer than a month to find the physical capsule, you'll have a chance to move it before they find it -- because by then the wrench attack should be over with and you can use your digital time capsule plus your hot wallet to move the funds.
And if you get kidnapped just give them the impression that the day after the real day is the day when you can access your coins. By the time they bring you there to do it, your coins will already be safe with someone you trust.

The blockchain grows at an average rate of 6 megabytes per hour, which is about 100 kilobytes per minute, or 1.67 kilobytes per second. So your setup is plenty fast enough. The minimum download speed to process it faster than it grows is: 6.1 megabytes per hour. You're doing ten times that per second, which is at least an order of magnitude faster than the minimum.
There are about 144 blocks generated per day, and each one averages out to a bit more than one megabyte apiece (though there is significant variation around that average). The whole blockchain is currently about 180 gigabytes, which, at your speed, would take about 48 hours to download if that's all your computer was doing, but presumably it is also doing other things -- such as processing each block and checking that each transaction follows the consensus rules -- so you should probably about double the time, and figure it will take four days to get synced.

You can find copies of the blockchain (up to its most recent blocks anyway) on Bittorrent and in various zip files around the web. So there is redundancy. If all the nodes went away, all someone would need to do to start the network up again is download a copy of the blockchain and fire up a node to process it. Its proof of work is still valid and speaks for itself -- any other nodes that connected to that node would continue to distribute blocks and new miners could fire up to to generate new blocks.

Privacy is easier to manage on bitcoin than on other platforms because the blockchain doesn't know your name. If you give a new address to everyone you receive money from, it's basically impossible for anyone who sends you money to find out how much you have, they can only know how much they've sent you.
The difficult things are address reuse and address consolidation. If you reuse one address for lots of transactions, anyone who sends you money at that address or receives money from that address can find out how much you have. And, if you consolidate your bitcoins by simply sending everything in all your addressees to a new address, anyone who has one of your old addresses can follow the money and find out how much you have in your new one.
Both of these problems have solutions: don't reuse addresses, and if/when you consolidate, anonymize your bitcoins first and consolidate them into three or four addresses instead of just one. You can anonymize your bitcoins in several ways, one of which is to turn it into Monero briefly and then change it back into bitcoins over the course of a few hours, sending it into three or four bitcoin addresses. Do that and you've anonymized your finances.

Keep in mind that lightning is not part of the bitcoin protocol. It is a way of writing smart contracts that use the bitcoin protocol, or any other compatible cryptocurrency. These smart contracts, which are optional things you can choose to use or not, allow for instant transactions secured by bitcoin's blockchain. But they are no more a part of bitcoin than android apps are part of android.

Who says they are required to trace customer transactions? I'm unaware of any such requirement, though if there is one I suspect it's part of the New York Bitlicense rather than a federal reporting requirement. I am confident there is no federal law requiring any such thing. But if you know of one, please share it.
BTW, I should have mentioned this earlier, but I'll put it here anyway: Wasabi is great, because it uses a Coinjoin mixer to enhance the privacy of their users, but it's not a perfect privacy solution yet. Coinjoin mixers like the one Wasabi uses are good, because they effectively remove "taint" from utxos, increasing coin fungibility. But they aren't as effective at removing address traceability. If I send you money through a Coinjoin mixer, you know my address was one of the ones that went into the mixer. That may be Limited knowledge, but it's still Some knowledge, which, when combined with other information, may allow you to trace an address back to me.
You can also discover upper and lower bounds on how much money I had in my address, by looking up the amounts in all the addresses that were part of the input.
The more mixers you use per transaction, the more effective they are at reducing traceability, but that's also expensive and it usually takes a long time. I am looking forward to further improvements in the vein of making bitcoin more private, though the solutions we currently have are getting better and better as people make them work smoother and increase their popularity. The main problems with mixers right now are cost, speed, and liquidity, and those are all being improved.


I agree on a no to ring signatures at present. Work is being done to make them more efficient, and/or soft-forkable, and I applaud that work. But what I think we really need is a way to ensure that a utxo is authentic while masking the address of origin. Coinjoin helps with this but it still provides Some information about the address of origin. (Specifically, you know it's one of the inputs, and you know upper and lower bounds on the amount of money that it held.) Perhaps something like sighash-noinput could be used for this -- if a person could sign a transaction that does not specify an input utxo, a pool of freshly coinjoined funds could provide the utxo and the originator could fund the pay them for it via lightning. Submarine swaps might even be able to make such a scenario trustless. The goal is that the recipient should have no way to prove any information about the address of origin, but there should be a way for the payer to show proof of payment.

Here is my summary of the principal changes in v. 0.17.0, based on the [video announcement]( and the [transcription](
 This post has many errors. Please see the commentary below it by Pieter Wuille.
- There is now support for watch-only addresses (so you can include your cold-storage coins in your balance without putting your private keys at risk -- or watch other addresses you know about if you're interested in them)
- There is a new way to select coins that makes it easier for large wallets with lots of small amounts to use up their change. The new coin-selection algorithm selects coins from your wallet with the goal of creating an exact match toward (spend amount) + (fees), that way users won't need to deal with so much change and dust anymore. (But only for those with wallets that have lots of small-amount coins.)
- This upgrade brings more support for users who have multiple wallets, including special buttons for it and some backend code to make multiple wallets more manageable. This is useful if you are running bitcoin core on a server and have lots of users creating wallets; now it's easier to run them all on the same bitcoin core instance.
- When Bitcoin Core is initially downloaded, before it has downloaded the blockchain, it will now have an option where you can set it to ping your peers to ask them how many coins are in the addresses you own. It sounds kind of similar to what SPV nodes do, at least to my mind, though it's probably different from SPV. Based on what your peers tell you, you can get a provisional view of your balance and, using that provisional information, you can even manage your balance before you've downloaded the blockchain. Once you've downloaded and processed the blockchain on your own, at that point you won't need to trust your peers for that provisional info, but it will be nice to have it while you're downloading.
- This upgrade lays some foundation stones for associating information with private keys in a new way. Currently private keys are only used for proving ownership of a bitcoin address and for signing transactions, but eventually we want to have different kinds of private keys that represent different scripts and functions. This upgrade lays the foundation for that, and if anyone wants more info, google "output descriptors". The speaker seems to think it's a pretty big deal: "The hope is that the whole wallet will be refactored around this idea of descriptors for outputs."
- They removed the api for a feature called "bitcoin accounts," which was a way of tracking your bitcoin income and outgo. The feature was buggy -- for example it sometimes said you had a negative balance, which is silly because there's no such thing as negative balances in bitcoin addresses -- and most people use better-coded third-party software to track their bitcoin income and outgo, so they removed the api for it.
- This upgrade adds support for broadcasting partially signed bitcoin transactions. This is useful when you have a multisig address and want to let the other party know you're ready to sign. You can now send him the partially signed transaction through the network without leaving the bitcoin core wallet. Of course it still won't be valid until the other party signs, but at least now you don't have to use an instant messenger or something to tell someone you're ready for his signature.
- This upgrade makes some ECDSA signatures about half a byte shorter. The speaker took this opportunity to gush about how excited he is that soon we'll be supporting Schnorr signatures, which will give users an escape route from the ineffeciencies of ECDSA. He thinks Schnorr will be included in the next softfork, which will also likely include Taproot and sighash-noinput. (Schnorr makes signature aggregation possible, which fits more transactions in a block; Taproot leverages that functionality to make all Schnorr transactions look identical, even if they use complicated scripts; and this boosts privacy; and sighash-noinput makes lightning contracts simpler and also makes watchtowers easier to code. None of these soft-forks are included in this release, he just chose this opportunity to talk about some of them.)
- Block propagation should be more efficient now because this upgrade includes a faster way to hash transaction ids, which all nodes need to do before they propagate a block. This should help a tiny tiny bit with the effort to decentralize mining, and it should also make network communications faster overall.
- The code for the GUI is now cleanly separated from the code for the wallet and the code for the node software. This makes future upgrades to these things easier while also making it easier for developers of other wallets to copy Bitcoin Core's wallet functions without copying its user interface.
- This upgrade puts in a new database that runs parallel with the one that holds the blockchain, but this new database only aggregates the utxos. Before this, the wallet had to infer where the utxos were by looking up it up in the blockchain; now it can refer to this utxo-only database, which should be faster.

First, LN invoices do indeed prevent you from sending to the wrong address, because it requires the node you type in to interact with yours to confirm the connection before you send payment. , If you mistype the node id, the typo'd invoice no longer connects you to the node that is prepared to interact with you. A typo can't tell your node "we're connected," and LN payments require the recipient node to confirm your connection before you send payment.
Second, you may be unaware that most bitcoin wallets already do error-checking using a checksum at the end of the address. If there is a typo in the address or the checksum, the checksum alerts your wallet that you're dealing with a typo'd address, and most wallets will then fail to send the payment. So bitcoin's underlying technology already enables error checking, and most wallets have implemented that. But lightning makes it even more difficult to send to a wrong wallet by forcing your wallet to interact with your recipient's and confirm that they're connected before the payment is sent.

1/ All merchants need to be online anyway to confirm that they've received payment. If consumers can't do that on the comparatively rare occasions when they receive money, they can still use a custodial wallet and withdraw their funds to their own wallet whenever they get online. That's far superior to using a bank.
2/ You don't need to pay a third party watchtower. You can run a watchtower program on your phone; as long as you get online more often than your timelock is set for (say, once a week), you can just do that, and protect yourself.

I'm not sure what's wrong with bitcoinjs, I've never used it, but today I've been doing my development using the open-source tools available at coinb.in. It's an open-source stratum-style wallet done entirely in client-side javascript. I am thinking of reusing that code to try to make a similar wallet in client-side javascript, but make it a true spv node, which is slightly better than a stratum-style wallet. Generating keypairs and turning the private key into wif has clearly documented sections in the underlying client-side javascript. You can even do a word-search for "generate a private and public keypair, with address and WIF address" and find the documented code in the free coin.js file. Enjoy!

Once again, I think there is a reason why people sometimes wanted the gold iou more than the gold itself -- but only for large amounts. (For small amounts they used gold coins.) Gold was heavy, and so if you had a large amount, it was easier to transact in ious than in the actual gold. The ious were useful in circumstances where large amounts of gold were inconvenient. But with bitcoin, it's different. Bitcoins don't weigh anything. In fact, I think the higher the on-paper value of the iou, the more you'd want the actual coins. If a bank offered you an iou for 1000 satoshis, you might consider leaving it in their custody, but only if it was somehow easier for them to manage your transactions than you. But if a bank offered you an iou for 5 whole bitcoins, I'll bet you'd want to turn it in immediately and get the coins. With bitcoin, higher amounts are not harder to manage or heavier to carry, so leaving it in a bank's custody only has downsides. That's another reason why I think fractional reserve wouldn't work with bitcoin. Unlike with gold, people would rather turn in the iou immediately than let the bank keep the custody. And if any bank refused to give anything but ious, it's customers would stop putting their money there.

1/ The main difference is that bitcoin smart contracts don't do loops. (I suppose this is also an answer to number 4.) Loops are a part of programming that allows your program to reuse code you've already used earlier in the program. For example, you might want a contract which has $100 to spend, and it is instructed to send $10 of that money to someone once a week for ten weeks. In bitcoin you'd have to write a new contract once per week, or write the same code ten times in the same contract, because bitcoin contracts can't reuse code. In ethereum a single contract could send out that money every week without rewriting instructions. Internally, ethereum can "loop back" to code it has already executed and execute it again. Bitcoin can't, so you'd have to rewrite it ten times in the above example.
2/ Script is the language bitcoin uses to execute transactions and smart contracts, and it is also the language those contracts/transactions are written in. Solidity is the equivalent language used by Ethereum and Rootstock (and it has more features than Script because Solidity can do loops). Simplicity is a language that is supposed to be easier to write than Script, but it doesn't work on bitcoin directly; it is a proposed replacement for Script, but afaik it isn't a popular proposal. It too is unable to do loops, but it is supposed to be cleaner to write in.
3/ Bitcoin and ethereum can both do multiple layered contracts, but not in the same way. In bitcoin you can have a first smart contract pass data and/or money on to a second smart contract, which is how the lightning network works, or you can chain together a bunch of "if/then" commands within a contract and run all the layers in parallel -- e.g. "if the user inputs data that has this characteristic, then follow this set of instructions, or if he inputs other data, then follow this other set of instructions." So bitcoin can indeed replicate the multiple layers of instructions that ethereum boasts of, but bitcoin does it slightly differently. And it can't do loops so you have to rewrite any code that you want to reuse.

Thank you, this is the first time I've seen that agreement (the 2016 Hong Kong agreement) and it does clearly have Adam Back's support. However, I think I'm perhaps reading it a bit different from you. It doesn't appear to give a timeline for when a 2mb hardfork will be included in bitcoin core. It distinctly says the code will be developed and recommended, but "will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community." That seems to be a strong clarification: the 2mb hardfork will be developed and recommended, but not necessarily adopted; only "with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community," which it did not have. Moreover, it seems to clarify this in the second section: "If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017." Note especially the phrase "likely happen" -- not definitely happen -- and the "if" clause.
It seems to me that a hardfork was coded and was "recommended" to bitcoin core. Would you agree that that part of the agreement was kept? And the part about adopting it was conditional only -- therefore, to not adopt it would not necessarily be breaking the agreement. Does that make sense? Thank you for the link.

You and your counterparty would have to decide how to determine the price when you're setting up the contract. You'd probably use an exchange that has a digital way of presenting their prices to outside applications, or you might use an aggregate of several exchanges, but it'd all depend on how you and your counterparty design the off-chain part of the contract.
The important thing is how immensely this expands the ability of smart contracts that use lightning channels. We could already write contracts that trigger automatic actions -- like where if you pay someone a certain amount, their server automatically sends you a product (one implementation of this functionality is "IfPayThenThat" by Blockstream) -- but now we can write contracts where third party actions trigger a payment from your lightning channel, supposing you signed the contract ahead of time. So, for example, once the company ships the product, *then* your payment is automatically triggered. This vastly increases the abilities of bitcoin smart contracts in a dramatic way.

No problem. You are right that the savings balance now displays correctly, since I've waited a while now. However, the amount in checking is still showing as pending, and I think it definitely ought to be confirmed by now. I also created a new channel with a Yalls peer so that I could buy a Yalls article, and...it still says it can't find a path to the invoice, even though I created and funded a channel directly with yalls using the qr code they put up right next to the invoice. Strange -- but I think it has something to do with my checking balance still showing up as pending rather than ready. Thoughts?

Since Segwit was a soft fork the code involved was already backwards compatible with the previous software. From day 1 of bitcoin, all the way back in 2009, you could have sent a payment to someone and sent them its signature separately -- though, before this upgrade, those payments would have been spendable by anyone. So you've always been on a chain where segwit payments could be done -- but now they can be done securely. The segwit upgrade made it possible to do *secure* payments where the signature remains onchain but is separated from the other transaction data. You could have done it before if you were willing to sacrifice security. Segwit only tightened the rules that already existed -- and btw using segwit is optional. If you don't like it, no one is forcing you to use segwit addresses.
@_date: 2018-05-28 02:27:42


I don't think you've ever been able to stop people from sending you a payment from a segwit address. Am I missing something? I think we might be using different definitions of what a segwit address is. By my definition a segwit address is an ordinary p2sh address -- it has no differences from any other p2sh address. Is that your understanding as well?


It seems to me that you, too, are repeating the same thing again. You are not forced to use the segwit client. If you want the segwit data, you *may* simply download it separately, *or* you may use a segwit client if you wish. You're not forced to do anything.


Before I answer your argument I'd like to clarify the terms. That is why I am asking you what you mean. Do you mean non-op-return nodes will still download arbitrary op_return data? Do you think op_return data counts as part of transactions which use them?

Watchtowers can be as trustless as bitcoin. A watchtower is a very simple computer program, and at least one of them is included in every lightning node except Eclair Mobile (which doesn't have one because watchtowers have to check in on the blockchain every couple of days, which isn't feasible for every smartphone user, particularly in countries without reliable internet access. Eclair's workaround is to just not accept inbound lightning transactions on mobile phones until there is a reliable, decentralized watchtower service.)
Since a watchtower is a very simple computer program, you can run one on your computer and/or your smartphone (assuming you get on the internet every few days), and upload all your transaction states to your own watchtower(s). Then you don't have to trust anyone, and you're still managing your own money trustlessly.
Also, there is a longterm development plan to connect the watchtowers in all the various lightning nodes in order to make them a default part of the decentralized lightning network. Then, when you upload channel states to any of these networked watchtowers, they will automatically share this anonymized data with other watchtowers. That way watchtowers are decentralized and reliable even for mobile users in third world countries.

It seems to me that there is a reason why people don't immediately turn in Federal Reserve notes for something else at their local bank, and that reason wouldn't exist if banks passed out ious for bitcoin. People don't turn in their dollars for something else at their local bank because there's nothing underlying the dollar. But with bitcoin, an iou for bitcoin could be immediately turned in for something more valuable and more useful -- a bitcoin. Therefore, anyone who received a bitcoin iou from their bank would immediately turn it in for a real bitcoin, and thus fractional reserve banking wouldn't work on a bitcoin system. At least, that's what I think would happen. Do you see anything in my above analysis that seems unlikely to you?

I disagree with your first statement. The buyer and the seller use an automatic system to process the payment. The payment occurs automatically and without the involvement of node operators, who may be offline, or even dead and buried when it happens. The contract happens to involve a timelock -- which is why the recipient may cash out before the payer pays (chronologically before, anyway) -- but contractually the ownership of the money has moved directly from the buyer to the seller, and the complete settlement on the blockchain occurs according to the terms of that contract -- even if not in chronological order.
When the recipient fulfills the conditions of the peer-to-peer transaction, he may close his channel and receive his funds. The funds come from the payer according to the terms of the contract, and all the nodes and node operators may be offline or dead without affecting that. You say "nothing further connects the sender and receiver" -- and I agree because you used the word "further," by which I think you mean, "beyond the transaction they've made" -- but that transaction is not complete until the money leaves the payer. The terms of the hashed timelocked contract make that clear.
BTW do you happen to know where couriers are exempted from money transmitter regulations? I don't ask you to challenge you. I want to see the exemption terms so I can further understand to what degree they do or do not apply to node operators, understood (to my mind anyway) as information carriers. Googling "money transmitter laws and couriers" doesn't seem to get me any specifics.

People could have done that before as well. You couldn't stop them; they could send you a perfectly valid bitcoin transaction where the witness data was segregated from the other transaction data, but it would have been insecure because anyone could spend it. Segwit made it so that only the recipient can spend such coins, unless the sender specifically makes it an anyone-can-spend tx.


No one is stopping you from viewing the whole blockchain. I think you mean, if you refuse to upgrade your node to support segwit, your node won't receive witness data for segwit transactions. That is true; but if you disapprove of segwit, then wouldn't you have already concluded that you don't want this segregated witness data? If so, then it seems to follow that you're receiving all the data that you want -- the rest is segwit data, which you don't want. But no one is stopping you from downloading that data if you Do want it.
It reminds me of when op_return was soft-forked in. It was a controversial softfork because op_return allowed people to add arbitrary data to the blockchain. I can imagine people back then saying "This is unfair because now we'll have to download and possibly store this arbitrary data, and I don't want to." Of course, they don't Have to; they could, if they wanted, set their own node to ignore op_return data. But if they don't want that data, they shouldn't complain that they're not getting it. "I've blocked my node from receiving op_return data and segwit data because I disagree with those proposals; but boo hoo, now I'm not receiving the whole blockchain!" Yeah, because you specifically excluded the parts that you don't agree with and/or don't want. Don't blame us for that. No one is stopping you from downloading the extra data that you don't want -- it's totally your decision.
In short, to claim that, because something controversial was added to the blockchain through a softfork, therefore it should have been a hardfork -- that seems to me to be the same idea that motivated the opponents of op_return. Does that make sense or am I still misunderstanding you?

It puts minimal load on your internet connection. A full node downloads about 1-2 megabytes every 10 minutes, which, if you put that in kilobytes per second, is about 1.6---3.2 kilobytes per second. (But it actually waits for a 1-2 mb chunk of data every 10 minutes so it's sorta useless to measure it in kilobytes per second.) Be aware that when you first start downloading the blockchain, which can take up to a week, it will hog your internet connection because it needs to download a file that is hundreds of gigabytes large, and it needs to download it in small chunks.


Yes. Except perhaps during the first week when it's downloading the whole blockchain.

Btw I do want to point out that there is a pretty easy way to get around bitcoin's built-in limitations: companies who want to write contracts for bitcoin that use loops often just write a normal computer program but write it so that it can access a bitcoin address, spend from it, and write data to the blockchain. Then they write a simple, separate contract for bitcoin that simply sends money and/or data to that address, whereupon the computer program takes over and runs the code. This maneuver saves blockspace on the blockchain by offloading complicated smart contracts to developers who can write programs that run them off the blockchain. In ethereum these more complicated contracts are directly on the blockchain, making it more massive, and leading to a situation where ethereum's blockchain is growing at an extraordinary rate, which is expensive for node operators if they try to archive the full ethereum blockchain. Their blockchain is already far larger than bitcoin's even though they've only been running for a few years, and it is precisely because they have no restrictions that limit how big or complicated a smart contract can be on their platform.

It's typically faster than cash because you don't have to deal with change. It's about as fast as debit/credit when you include pin codes and signatures. But it is also better than those two options, because it's anonymous and more secure. It's also cheaper for the merchant to accept bitcoin than credit/debit, because the merchant doesn't have to pay any transaction fees. Moreover, bitcoin apps are available to minors (unlike credit/debit) and the monetary policy behind bitcoin is superior to any governmental monetary policy, making bitcoin a stronger currency. There are also no chargebacks, no overdraft fees, no interest rates, and no hacks. All of these make bitcoin a better option than credit/debit and cash.

I tried again after waiting a few hours and I still get the white screen problem. There is no difference re: the white screen problem from my previous description.
However, I am now able to connect to peers and I am also able to create channels using the qr scanner if I scan them off of acinq's lightning testnet explorer. I've opened a channel with a well-connected node through this method, and while doing so I found a bug I hadn't encountered before: when I first tried to open a channel after waiting for a few hours, the connection timed out, but the "pending open channel count" increased from 0 to 1 so I was happy to wait a bit. That's not the bug though, this is the bug: After waiting a bit for the pending channel to actually open, nothing seemed to be changing, so I decided to hit the "create channel" button again without changing the information in the fields. This time it instantly created the channel -- yay! -- but a few unexpected things happened: first, the pending open channel count changed from 1 to 2, which was unexpected (I figured I should only have one channel open since I didn't change any of the information when I hit "connect" the second time), and -- much worse -- all the testcoins I had in savings disappeared. That is, the interface now says that my onchain balance is zero, even though I intentionally left the majority of my testcoins in savings, and only put a relatively small amount in my lightning balance. I suppose there's probably a bug that caused that behavior. The lightning balance still has some coins, but my onchain balance says it is zero.
You asked: "wrt to savings -&gt; checking transfer, when you were trying to do it, were there already a lot of nodes?"
There were a lot of nodes listed in "show network graph nodes." When I first tried it, I couldn't connect with any of them (though I did make a successful connection to the faucet, even though the faucet's webpage didn't work for me). Even though I couldn't connect with the nodes in "show network graph nodes," a reasonably sized list of nodes did show up, and that was comforting. While preparing my original post, the one you replied to, I tried it again and that time I was able to connect to the other nodes, but when using the "open channel to an existing peer" button I still got the blank white screen problem. As I type this post, I've tried it again, and I still get the white screen problem.
Don't get discouraged because I'm having problems btw -- this is of course what bug testing and alphas and betas are for. I'm grateful for your hard work and responsiveness to my feedback!

No it's a caricature of an actual guy in real life named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. The media once decided he must be the real Satoshi because he happens to be a programmer and was once a neighbor of Hal Finney, the first guy to receive a bitcoin payment. But cryptography isn't his specialty and in short it's definitely not him. He occasionally comes to crypto conferences though because he's like a minor celebrity in this space now due to the case of mistaken identity that happened. People sometimes use his face as a representation of Satoshi because he's the community's favorite "faketoshi."

I don't know of any wallets that do recurring payments. It can be done, but I'm not aware of any wallet that does it. There should be a way for a merchant to put up a qr code that a wallet can scan and it says, "Do you want to send X address $15 a month? Yes or no."

If you only have a channel to one node, you can't make any money by routing payments. If you have channels to more than one node, you can make some money -- especially if your channels are well-funded and they connect popular destinations. I recommend making well-funded channels with popular nodes, such as Bitrefill, Satoshi's Place, [mainnet.yalls.org]( Rompert, and Acinq.

To wit.
There is nothing wrong with accepting 0-conf payments for small sales if the merchant thinks the chance of a double-spend is low. Btc allows that; bch didn't invent 0-conf payments they just advertised it as a core feature. I've personally made 0-conf payments with btc and received the product I wanted instantly. But it shouldn't be done for large payments -- on btc OR bch -- because 0-conf payments are insecure.
All you have to do to reverse a 0-conf payment is set a low fee on it, and then send the miners a new payment with a large fee that sends the same coin to an address you control. The software on both btc and bch allows the miners to mine either transaction -- and game theory says they are likely to mine the higher fee payment, which cancels the 0-conf payment.
To accept 0-conf payments, as a merchant, means trusting the payer and the miners not to do that. For small payments, like coffee, it's probably fine, because first of all, who's gonna go through the trouble? and second of all, if they do, it's easy to catch them after-the-fact, and so you can just stop selling that person coffee. But for large payments, you should not rely on 0-conf payments, because they are insecure.

Bitcoin smart contracts are written in the Script programming language. All bitcoin smart contracts involve payment, at the very least they require a payment to the miner who mines them and processes the script. The lightning network allows any bitcoin payment to be done via payment channels -- *any* bitcoin payment, including conditional payments that will only execute if a miner processes the smart contract. To that extent, lapps are similar to dapps.
Lapps are also unlike dapps in several ways. Dapps are written in Solidity instead of Script (assuming they are on ethereum or rootstock), and Solidity allows for instruction recursion, which is a powerful programming feature. Dapps also have no upper bound for how large the app can be, whereas bitcoin apps have to written in code that is small enough to fit in bitcoin's limited blockspace.
Two of the most recent things that have been implemented for lapp development are a feature called "if_pay_then_that" and a feature called discreet log contracts. If_pay_then_that allows you to write contracts that will automatically do something once a payment is received -- for example you might make a gumball machine that automatically spits out a gumball when a payment is received.
Discreet log contracts have several uses, but one of them is the converse of if_pay_then_that -- it's if_this_then_pay. That is, using a discreet log contract you can write a contract for a customer to sign and run in their payment channel. What does it do? Well, one thing it can do is automatically send a payment when the terms of the contract are fulfiled. For example, a warehouse could write a contract with you that you can sign so that, at the moment they ship a product to you, at that moment you make an automated payment to them without having to sit there at your computer and click "Do it." You'd have preauthorized it, but with a condition that the contract will only execute the payment once they've proven that they did the thing they said they would do.
I hope these examples show you some of the differences between lapps and dapps and the new powers brought into bitcoin by means of lapps. Dapps are still more powerful for onchain applications than lapps are -- but lapps are very powerful too, and have their own benefits over dapps.

I've got a user experience report for you, hope it helps:
- I created a new wallet, and thought this process was similar to other bitcoin apps and intuitive/acceptable. On a side note, I'm sure you won't listen to this advice but I personally dislike the common procedure where wallet apps force users to take security precautions by making them write down the multi word seed and then type it back in. I think wallets should give people an option to be idiots: automatically prepare a text file for them with their seed words and open up the "share" screen so they can email that file to themselves. I encourage you to embrace the idea of giving people the option to use terrible security if they are lazy idiots or just testers. We testers in particular don't like jumping through hoops when we're not going to keep this address or store anything of value in it.
- I like that it gives you basic instructions with step by step buttons for how to get started. Also, I think there should be an option to get rid of this getting-started interface once you're done getting started. For someone who already has bitcoins in the app, they'll probably want their main screen to show them their lightning balance and give them tools to manage it, with a button to let them look at their onchain balance and manage that. (I also appreciate your decision to speak of these balances as a checking account and a savings account, which is quite intuitive, though I personally think we should gradually -- eventually -- get people used to referring to these things as addresses and wallets instead of accounts. For advanced users especially I think "lightning balance" and "onchain balance" are more appropriate descriptions than checking account and savings account.)
- Even though I like the basic instructions, they largely didn't work for me. The first step was to wait for syncing -- this was fine, though I noticed that when I got off wifi on my trip home and reconnected at home, the app got stuck syncing and I had to restart it. There's a possible bug somewhere in there.
- The next step was to receive test coins. I successfully and easily copy-pasted my pubkey into the field on the faucet page -- so far so good. The fields for channel amount and initial balance confused me -- I was like, "My channel amount is currently zero. Is it asking how much I want to receive?" I decided to type in the number 100,000 because that's what was greyed out in the field as if it was expected or some kind of default. Later I saw that there's an instruction in your app underneath the link to the faucet where you say to use an amount that is over 250,000 -- I think that instruction should be clearly visible before the user taps the link, because I didn't see it until later and if I missed it, I'm sure other people will as well. Then with the second field I was like "initial balance, that's obviously zero, because that's how much I'm starting out with." But it wouldn't take zero as an option so I typed in the recommended one -- 50,000. I still don't know exactly what these fields mean, and confusion is not something you want for your users, so perhaps some more explanatory instructions would be advisable for this part. Anyway -- after getting amounts in there that the page's javascript error-correcter accepted as valid, I hit the submit button, whereupon the page tried to establish a connection to somewhere and timed out. I tried this repeatedly and it kept timing out -- I haven't yet gotten it to work, so that counts as a bad user experience. Likely user error -- but perhaps it is an opportunity for user-education on your part so that others don't have a bad user experience.
- I went down to the "savings account" card next and decided it might be good to get some testnet coins into my onchain balance through a trusty onchain transaction. There are no instructions in your app for receiving testnet coins via an onchain transaction, but I didn't really expect any instructions because that's not what this app is about and also I already know how. Getting those testnet coins into the app worked just fine though -- no problems there. 
- After I had some testnet coins in the app I tried to transfer them to my lightning balance (i.e. "checking account"). I tried "open channel to an existing peer" because it sounded simple, but there seems to be a bug -- the screen turns white, a "cancel" button briefly appears but then goes away within a half of a second, and the interface remains completely white with no buttons or anything -- just empty white space from the top of the screen to the bottom. So I hit the back button, which unexpectedly minimized the app. After opening it again, I found myself at the homescreen. But I didn't need to resync, so I guess the daemon at least was still running in the background. Very poor user experience here. No matter how many times I try the "Open channel to an existing peer" button, that's what happens: white screen, brief appearance of a cancel button for half a second, then permanent white screen, until I hit back or home -- which then seems to restart the interface. Something's going wrong here obviously, but I'm not sure what.
- I decided to try to connect to a lightning node using the qr scanner, so I loaded up acinq's testnet explorer and scanned the qr codes of some well-connected nodes. I mostly kept getting an error message saying that they were not online (even for ones that I highly suspect Are in fact online, such as Endurance), but at least once I managed to find one that was online, but, alas, the attempt to establish a connection timed out, and the "pending open channel count" remained at zero. This is also a poor user experience and I was at it for about 10 minutes unsuccessfully.
- After all that I went into the "show network graph nodes" button and tried to connect to my peers in there. For a long time each peer said a connection could not be established -- and I even made sure I was fully synced by checking the message at the top of the app's homepage, which said I was synced -- but each peer still said a connection could not be made. After typing out most of this post I tried again and, lo and behold, connecting to those guys worked. This too is a poor user experience, though, because establishing these connections does not seem to have an obvious reason why it should not work for a long time and then suddenly work. And I still cannot move anything from my onchain balance to my lightning balance, nor does the faucet page work. So overall it's a very poor user experience, though your user interface is pretty good, and I like its helpful step by step instructions -- even if they didn't work for me and I think there should be a button to get rid of them once the setup is done.
I hope this explanation of my user experience is helpful in finding bugs and improving the app. I'm grateful for your efforts!

I agree with the other poster who said bitcoin is unlikely to completely replace federal cash, though I do think it will give people a better alternative (and I don't think any government can really stop it). Regarding crypto loans, you can actually get those. Look up bitcoin microlending. You sign a contract saying that you'll receive some amount of bitcoins and are legally obligated to pay it back on a certain schedule with interest, and boom, you just entered a bitcoin loan contact. Such contracts are enforced the same way other contracts are -- through the courts. The current bitcoin microlending services will eventually turn into larger services if bitcoin takes over.
Regarding the guy who asked what would happen in a bitcoin economy if there was an economic crash and the government couldn't print money to get out of it -- it is questionable whether printing money is any kind of solution to an economic crash in the first place. In the second place, it is questionable whether it is the government's job to manage the economy. And in the third place, inflation may be a form of theft, and if so, it should never be done, not even if it would make some people happy. One of the best things about bitcoin imo is that it makes inflation impossible (except for mining, which is temporary). Bring on the day when a recession happens and the government can no longer make it worse through the misguided policy of printing money. (I don't actually want a recession to happen btw, that's just rhetorical exaggeration.)

You can also send onchain funds to Lightning Conductor and he will use those to create a channel to you. See his website for more info. The LND team has a programmer named Alex Bosworth working on a trustless way to do this called "submarine swaps," which is expected to be included directly in LND. See submarineswaps.org for his toy implementation. This tool, when ready, will allow swap providers on LND to create a pool of liquidity for merchants and users who are willing to pay onchain funds for channel creation, and swap providers will then compete with one another to charge the smallest fee for doing so.

Yes. The easiest way is to use Eclair for Android, which is a mobile implementation of one of the top three most popular lightning wallets. Eclair Mobile is capable of *sending* lightning payments and onchain payments -- but it can only *receive* onchain payments, not lightning payments. The app is easy to download and has a nice interface, and it's not difficult to send funds to your Eclair wallet via an onchain transaction and then automatically connect to another node on the network and open a channel with them. You can let the app automatically open a channel for you with a well-connected node, or if you want to do it manually you'll need to use a lightning explorer to find a peer -- and that is complicated but doable.
If you want to do this on the desktop, and you're running Windows, the steps to set up a full lightning node are difficult. Since Eclair Mobile makes everything easy, it's even the easiest option right now for a non-technical desktop Windows user. What you can do is download Bluestacks, which is a program that lets you run Android apps on the desktop and gives you access to the Google Play Store on a Windows device. Once you have Bluestacks running, download Eclair Mobile and voila, you've got yourself a lightning wallet on your desktop that is easy to use and works well.

Before State 1 there was State 0: Alice and Bob create a contract which states that, when it is pushed to the blockchain, Bob shall receive 0.5 btc and Alice shall receive 0.5 btc. This leads to State 1. However, this contract has an additional provision in it: there is a random number H, which, if revealed, shall send Bob's money to Alice, and a random number Q, which, if revealed, shall send Alice's money to Bob. The software is made in such a way that if either of them pushes an old contract to the blockchain, H or Q will be revealed, depending on who pushed it. The victim can then use the number to enact the extra provision, and take the offender's funds.
I think it works something like that, though I'm shaky on some of the details.

Though if we make privacy focused *all around superior* to the alternatives (like we're doing with lightning, and now maybe with Wasabi), people will just default to that, which helps them, and everyone else, and so on.

I agree, LN is better than 0-conf. One reason is because of the added security they bring, another is because of lower fees. But still, I think 0-confs are "safe enough" for low-value payments. (See below for more on that.)


Until then, double-spends are safe enough for low value payments.


Should we call it a pending payment? A replaceable payment? A simple message containing transaction info that is not yet anything more than a message? What's the best nomenclature here? Whatever it is, I think it's okay for merchants to accept whatever-we-call-ums as long as the value is small. And I think I'm in good company here; in Mastering Bitcoin Chapter 10, Andreas points out that a typical cafe owner (for example) "[should be] willing to accept payment for cups of coffee without waiting for confirmation (mining in a block), because the risk of a double-spend on a cup of coffee is low in comparison to the convenience of rapid customer service. This is similar to the practice of coffee shops that accept credit card payments without a signature for amounts below $25, because the risk of a credit-card chargeback is low while the cost of delaying the transaction to obtain a signature is comparatively larger." [source](
Satoshi also seemed to think this was acceptable: "it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less." [source]( Read the context to see a more detailed description, where he says that they can just accept payments without waiting for a confirmation.
In my opinion, the reasons they gave for why this is low-risk still apply. I don't argue that they are right because they are authoritive; I just think they give good arguments.

Escrow usually means that the market owner holds the customer's payment until (a) the customer says he got his product or (b) it's been two weeks or so and there's been no complaint or (c) a complaint has been filed, in which case the payment still gets held until the issue is resolved. It's a standard way to protect the customer from bad actors.

Yeah but the way they peg bitcoins to lbtc is federated, which, if my understanding is correct, means token issuance is essentially federated too. And federated means "not trustless." You're still trusting people with your money when you go to put it on Liquid or take it off -- it's just that you're trusting a group instead of an individual. I'd love to be corrected, though, as I've done very little research on this.

Here's a solution: whenever someone else wants to hold your money for you ("because you can trust me, I'm a NEW and Different kinda bank"), tell them lol no and get a free bitcoin wallet. Then you're holding your own money.

Yes. Lightning wallets use segwit addresses, and you can make those for free wihout touching the bitcoin network, just by using your wallet offline. A lightning channel uses a multisig segwit address, and you can make those without touching the bitcoin network too, though you would have to connect with your counterparty somehow to get their signature. But yeah they are free to create and it only costs money to actually send bitcoins into the channel.


Yes, assuming the exchange is willing to send funds to your channel with an onchain transaction. They might deduct part or all of the fee from you, though, depending on their fee policy.


Some do that, others don't. It depends on the exchange and probably on future network conditions.


Yes, except it's not unlimited, there are limits to how many addresses you can put in a batch. I haven't done the math, but I imagine the limit is somewhere near 4000, because there's only a certain amount of channels that can be funded per block. And the fee for that batch-funding transaction would need to be paid by someone, either the exchange or the people in the batch. It would be a pretty expensive transaction because each address is 32 or more bytes, and there's hundreds of them, maybe even thousands. Let's suppose the exchange pays 50 satoshis per byte to batch 1000 people. That's 50 satoshis * 32 bytes * 1000 people, or .016 btcs -- a $102 fee at today's prices. And you also have to pay for signature data, though if we adopt Schnorr signatures the signature data shouldn't be a significant cost. I doubt many exchanges will want to shoulder a $102 fee every time they do a batch transaction, so many of them will likely deduct this $102 fee from all the people in the batch, so that each person pays about 10 cents. (If each of 1000 people pays 10 cents the total is $100.) Batching + Schnorr + Lightning should allow us to onboard people pretty cheaply and still pay the miners enough to secure the network. Once people have money in their lightning channels, they can make and receive lots of lightning payments for a long time before they have to do another onchain transaction and get into another batch.

Yes, you can use both. Payments sent to one address won't show up in the other one though, unless you manually send the money from the one to the other.
BTW blockchain.info and Coinbase Wallet are both a type of wallet called a "custodial wallet," which means that those companies (blockchain.info and Coinbase) hold your bitcoins for you. It is generally recommended that you should store your bitcoins in a non-custodial wallet, such as Greenbits or Samourai, where you hold your own bitcoins on your device. (And you should make a backup too.) Otherwise, if either of those companies ever goes bankrupt, they could take all your money down with them.

It's still low-risk. Very few people are going to go through the trouble of trying a double-spend attack to get a free hamburger.


No, could you send a link? I'd like to know more. I suppose "easily" is a good adverb to use in a case like Todd's, where he's someone with the know-how to set up a direct connection to a miner and craft a custom transaction. But I don't think the masses have that know-how or the inclination to go through such troubles for such a small gain. Unless an app automates the process and becomes popular, I don't think merchants have to worry about losing too much money via doublespend attacks on 0-confs for low-value payments.


1. The merchant would not need to wait for you. He could be relaxed about applying the above two variables if a low-fee payment only occasionally happened. I think that low-fee payments are rather uncommon since most wallets use a fee-estimating algorithm by default. Among those users who Do use low-fee payments, I think most of them are honest people who aren't going to try to shaft him on a 0-conf doublespend. So even if he wasn't rigorous, the merchant isn't taking much risk.
2. But also, if the merchant *was* rigorously applying the two variables I mentioned, there are methods he could use to decrease the number of low-fee payments, from a soft method (put up a sign by the register or a message on the site that says "Low-fee payments may be ignored. Please use a fee higher than X.") to a hard method (Bip 70). If you refuse to follow instructions, you get no soup, but I think most bitcoiners would happily follow merchant instructions.
3. Do you ever buy stuff from a merchant who uses Bitpay as their payment processor? If so, do you use 1-2 s/b even then? If so, do you decode their bip-70 codes every time in order to set a custom fee of 1-2 s/b? And, if so, then have you ever found yourself standing there waiting for a confirmation so you could leave the store?

Agreed. Wasabi offers a major improvement in the areas of fungibility and privacy. However, we (bitcoiners) are not all the way there yet. Combining this with Breeze and Lightning gets us probably over 90% of the way there though, toward close-enough-to-perfect privacy and fungibility. (At least for those who want it and are willing to spend a few minutes to go private.)

Here is my current understanding of how it works, which I suspect is at least partly wrong (I hope someone with greater knowledge will correct me):
The Liquid sidechain uses tokens called "lbtc"s (liquid bitcoins) that are created and distributed by a group of exchanges and other bitcoin companies called a federation. The members of this federation make a bunch of promises about what they'll do; namely, they promise to hold one another accountable, they promise not to create lbtcs out of thin air, they promise that they'll only create an lbtc token when a corresponding bitcoin is sent to their sidechain, and they promise that every lbtc token they create will be distributed to the same persons or groups who sent them a corresponding bitcoin. By keeping all these promises they hope to ensure that the value of lbtcs is pegged to bitcoin's value. However, I don't personally trust them to keep their promises. In my opinion, the very fact that lbtcs are created and distributed by the federation means that the value of lbtc tokens relies on us trusting the federation, and that is itself enough of an issue (at least to my mind) that I don't personally think lbtcs are really as valuable as the bitcoins they are supposed to be pegged to.
In other words, I don't think that exchanges and other bitcoin companies can maintain a true value peg if they have the ability to create these tokens by merely pressing a button. In fact, I think that it's dangerous to treat lbtc tokens as if they have the same value as bitcoins, because I don't think any federation is trustworthy enough to wield that kind of power without abusing it. If they can press a button to create and distribute lbtcs, and if people value lbtcs, I think they will be pressured to push that button too often, and I think they will sometimes succumb to that pressure and create additional lbtcs and give them to their friends. As a result, I don't plan on sending any of my bitcoins to the Liquid sidechain, because I don't think "liquid bitcoins" will hold their value relative to actual bitcoins.

The thing we most need right now is for people to try to *use* the lightning network for payments and report what problems they come across. Use the issue tracker for whatever version you're using.
Issue tracker for LND: 
Issue tracker for C-Lightning: 
Issue tracker for Eclair: 
If you click any of those links and scan through the issues people bring up, you might be intimidated by all the unfamiliar words. But that doesn't mean you're not welcome if you're not as much of a technical person as some of the other bug reporters are. Here's how you can contribute without knowing code:
First, if you make a payment and it fails, share a screenshot. Give as many details as you can. Here's a great bug report: "I tried to send a payment to Satoshi's Place, everything went okay up until I hit the Send button, and then it said Error 30043: Routing error -- here's a screenshot." That's all you need! Although, if you know what I mean by "log files," it's nice to provide a copy of your log files (or just the part where the error happened).
Keep in mind that one of the things devs are looking for right now is what issues people are running into the most, so that they can optimize to fix those. So don't worry yourself with thoughts like "Routing issues are already well-known, I don't need to report those." Yes, do report them! We need measurable statistics on stuff like this. If only 1 out of 1000 bug reports were for routing issues, the developers would think routing is basically solved. So whenever you experience a failure, report it, even if you think it's well known, because you're contributing to usage statistics, helping us find common problems, and putting pressure on developers to optimize to get rid of such problems.
Payment failures are not the only things to report. Have a friend who isn't into bitcoin try to use your wallet to make a payment. What issues does he or she run into? Does he or she not know what buttons to push or what commands to type? Report it. Does he or she not know where to find open channels or what they are? Report it. Common problems with the user interface should be tracked too, and you can help there. Let them know what you're having trouble with and what other people might have trouble with.


It means you can't make or receive payments in those channels. Try to put about $50 in each of your channels and do that until you feel like you're about to risk too much money. It will add up quickly, so you might not get very many channels open, but that's fine. $50 channels are more than enough for testing the network right now.


Can't help you much here, as I don't have any public channels, but I do know that you get fees when people use your channels. But hey, if there's nothing you can find that indicates if you've made money or not, let the developers know in the issue tracker. Tell them you'd like some indicator. If enough people report this, they may put in some kind of notification option, like weekly notifications or with a style like "Notify me when I've made more than 100 satoshis" with a configurable amount. Or they might just put something more obvious in the log files.

It's called LIT. And it's hugely different from the current LN, different enough that it is currently incompatible with the BOLT specifications. That could change, of course, but it's actually not as big a deal as it sounds. Since LIT and BOLT are both able to provide proofs of payment, we can at the very least integrate them with each other via submarine swaps. E.g if you want to buy from CokaKola using LIT but he only accepts BOLT, you can send a LIT payment to me in exchange for an equivalent BOLT payment to CokaKola via my BOLT wallet, and this can be done trustlessly with guaranteed payment. But that's all theoretical -- by the time we're there I'd be surprised if there weren't a more efficient way to integrate the two networks.

You are wrong about this. You only give them a hash of that state; if they broadcast that hash, nothing happens, because it's not a valid transaction. They have to decrypt the hash first, but they don't have the decryption key. They only see it when a transaction closing your channel gets broadcast. (The channel contact has a provision that says the closure won't be valid unless this description key is included as part of the channel closure.)


No they can't; they can't close a channel on their own. One of the counterparties has to initiate the channel closure; the watchtower may then broadcast the contract they have in their memory, but only if the decryption key matches the one they're looking for. And if the closure contract is newer than the version they have in their memory, they will never see the right decryption key.

Yes, that is a pretty extraordinary example. And it is noteworthy that, as slow as that bugpatch was at getting adopted, it was still an order of magnitude faster at breaking 50% than segwit has been. I guess the numbers were higher for the bugpatch because people's nodes were at risk of getting bricked if they didn't upgrade. It was more critical than segwit is because the only immediate benefit of segwit is lower fees, but fees are low anyway right now so it doesn't hit people in the gut the way the CVE bug could have. Still, 40%+ of nodes still haven't patched the CVE bug even now that the patch is well tested, so it's no surprise that segwit is still hovering around 50%.
(A minute ago I said the "only" immediate benefit of segwit was lower fees. But that's technically not true. It technically also enabled an address format that is immune to the malleability bug, and for developers that was a big deal because it allows secure chained transactions and secure payment channels. But most people haven't started using those things yet so I said "only" even though there were really other immediate benefits that most people just haven't really paid attention to yet. BTW in case I just confused you, the malleability big is different from the CVE bug that recently got patched; the malleability bug is a longstanding and widely known bug among developers which isn't critical, but which makes certain types of nonstandard transactions insecure. Developers needed a way to fix it before they could do secure chained transactions or secure payment channels, and segwit made that possible, because segwit addresses are immune to the malleability bug.)

This is such an awesome project, thank you for all you're doing for the community.
I want to make a suggestion which is actually a *dis*improvement from the perspective of financial sovereignty, but might make this payment processing option more palatable for merchants. And that is if you launched an option that integrated a "regular" fiat payment processor alongside the bitcoin payment processor. As someone who personally dislikes fiat and tries not to hold any, it pains me to say it, but when I've suggested bitcoin to merchants before, the thing that is a real turn-off for them (in my experience) is that it complicates things for the buyer. I think this perception could be mitigated if bitcoin was simply one option alongside credit, debit, and paypal; if your system was a one-stop shop where they could set up all of the above, it might be a more attractive option.

BTW BIP70 "Payment Protocol" is a feature that was introduced into the bitcoin network in 2013. It does several things; for one, it allows wallets to communicate with each other and agree on things like what miner fees to use. Also, it makes it so that when you scan a qr code, instead of seeing a bitcoin address you see the web address of whoever you're paying. That can help cut down on man-in-the-middle attacks and also makes more sense to people who are new to bitcoin (because everyone knows what a web address is). Not all bitcoin wallets support BIP70. Bitpay uses BIP70 to make bitcoin payments seem faster; when a wallet scans a "Payment Protocol" qr code created by Bitpay, Bitpay tells the wallet a number of conditions that it must meet in order to make the payment. Once a payment is made that meets Bitpay's standards, they consider the payment verified even before it has been confirmed on the blockchain. This makes payments seem instant while we wait for the developers to finish the lightning protocol, which will make bitcoin payments instant for real.

Your second sentence almost contradicts your first sentence and is also wrong.

But you save yourself from contradiction by saying "theoretically" and by repeating your qualification about this only working if all miners were honest. But you're still wrong because there's nothing dishonest about mining the second transaction you see, or really whatever transaction you want. So you're both wrong and nearly self-contradictory.

On the lightning network, multiple transactions are bundled together and broadcast as a single one, sharing one transaction fee among many users, up to several thousand at a time. So your transaction fee goes down to one or two cents, depending on how many people are using the network. (The more people in the bundle, the lower the fees, because a single transaction fee is split up among all the people in the bundle.) So your $4 coffee could have a transaction fee of about a penny.

In this case, I'm using the word instant to mean "only as much time as it takes for a transaction to reach the merchant's mempool." To me, that's pretty much instant, and involves acceptably low risk for low-value payments. Andreas talks about this in Mastering Bitcoin Chapter 10, where he points out that a typical cafe owner (for example) "[should be] willing to accept payment for cups of coffee without waiting for confirmation (mining in a block), because the risk of a double-spend on a cup of coffee is low in comparison to the convenience of rapid customer service. This is similar to the practice of coffee shops that accept credit card payments without a signature for amounts below $25, because the risk of a credit-card chargeback is low while the cost of delaying the transaction to obtain a signature is comparatively larger." [source](
Satoshi also seemed to think this was acceptable: "it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less." [source]( Read the context to see a more detailed description, where he says that they can just accept payments without waiting for a confirmation.
Whether or not a 0-conf payment is acceptable depends on the merchant and how much risk they are willing to take, but they are certainly a lot faster than waiting for a blockchain confirmation, they are practically instant, and many big wigs in this space think they are acceptable for low-value payments. (But lightning is still better, partly because it has lower fees.)

I think perhaps he means something like "smart *analysis* systems won't *count* segwit when blocks are empty." IIUC, block rewards are always counted as segwit transactions even though they aren't, because they *look* like segwit since they have no signature. But now that I've said so I suspect I am wrong, because in fact I suspect it's trivially easy to exclude block reward transactions from the segwit count -- can anyone clarify?

Bip70 is not proprietary. It's been part of bitcoin for years, it's just that it was rarely used (until Bitpay made it a part of their POS system), so wallet makers rarely built it into their wallets. But it's def not proprietary.

I didn't find any, so I concede the point. But for physical retailers I don't think it's a significant risk. If you accept 0-conf payments at your store, and someone comes in who tries to clear out all your merchandise and pay in bitcoin, that should be a red flag, but for ordinary payments I don't think there's a significant risk.

You're supposed to *add* them, not concatenate them.
Concatenation is when you append one thing to another: 1 + 1 = 11.
Addition is when you increase the value of one thing by another: 1 + 1 = 2.
In code, concatenation increases the *number* of bytes, whereas addition increases the *value* represented by the same number of bytes. So when you add 256 bytes to 256 bytes you don't get 512 bytes; you still have 256 bytes, but the *value* represented by those bytes increases. Just like when you add 1 to 1 you don't get 11; you get a *number of higher value than 1* but it takes up the same amount of space (i.e. same amount of data).

You speak of bootleg internet connections as if they are difficult to set up. For you and me they might be (actually I think if you googled "virtual private network" you'd find that there are pretty simple, nearly-one-click solutions...including things as simple as browser extensions). For anyone with a mining rig, they're already tech savvy. They won't have any trouble looking up how to set up a virtual private network and connect to the internet through that. Then the government can't know where they are or what sites they are visiting, or that they are even on the internet or sending data packets.
Same goes for developers: if your country blocks github, you can set up a vpn and tell that virtual private network to use a country-code that Hasn't blocked github. Then you can connect to github no problem.
What the government Could do is declare that bitcoin is illegal and anyone who uses it is subject to prosecution. They can do that -- but I think they are starting to realize that such laws are basically impossible to enforce.

If you send funds into a lightning channel address it will not show up in either node's channel balance because lightning wallets do not display the balance of the *whole* address but of *however much you own* in that address -- i.e. the amount for which you have a signed payment contract paying it to you. Neither user will have a signed payment contract for funds that randomly got sent into the channel. However, the funds are not lost. A lightning channel address is a 2-of-2 multisig segwit address; the funds will be registered there on the blockchain, and the users can access the funds by cosigning a multisignature transaction that moves the funds. By doing this, they can do pretty much anything they want with them: divide up the funds between them, transfer it all to one or the other of the participants, or send it to some other address. But they have to agree on what to do with them, because you can't move money from a 2-of-2 multisig address unless both parties cosign.

It's standard practice in bitcoin to only use an address once.

Reusing addresses reduces your privacy. People who send money to a reused address can see its financial history, which is part of your financial history.

I told a friend I bought some when it was at $1355 and I found that he had heard of it but didn't understand it. "Do you want to learn about it? I a could show you some cool videos that explain it very well." Crickets. When the price passed $2500 he became interested and started asking me all about it. I showed him some videos on youtube and tried to explain some of the concepts like why managing your money online without a bank is a game changer. 
He seemed not to understand anything about it but the price increases, but he did like saying bullish things like he heard in the videos -- "It's like they're trying to introduce the internet to people for the first time!" He decided he wanted to buy some, and asked me how, then got confused thinking that exchanges "own" the blockchain and manage it. He said things like, "The videos said bitcoin is anonymous, but it's not. Bitcoin wants all your info before they'll sell you any." I could see that he wasn't getting it.
He decided to put $50 in, still believing the hype, and told me that in a couple of weeks he'd buy a new laptop using his profits. I tried to explain that the price was unlikely to go up six times its current value in a couple of weeks, but he figured that since I'd made hundreds of dollars in a few weeks, he would too, even though I bought in significantly earlier and put much more money into it. 
Well, the price dropped significantly, and he lost most of his excitement. I was busy selling my coins locally for 10% above the spot price and then buying back in with the profit, so I kept making money even though the price had decreased, and he kept on asking why my btc values were going up while his were going down. I explained that it involved buying earlier, buying more, and repeating that process, but it didn't "click" and we kept having a conversation like this one: "Did you make anything today?" -- "Yes." -- "Did I?" -- "No." Groans. "Why can't I do what you're doing?" -- "Do you want to learn how?" -- "Sure." -- "Here are the videos I watched." -- "I don't want to watch them." -- "Then good luck."
When he had $40 worth left out of his original $50 purchase, he grew impatient and demanded that I show him how to spend his bitcoins -- despite my telling him that it was unwise to sell so early, and after a loss. But since it is his money, I showed him, and he spent $10 on a Coinbase debit card. It hasn't arrived, and he lost almost all the rest of his interest and excitement. He is so uninterested now that I don't think he cares enough to even check out what happened to his shipment. He has less money than he started out with, he doesn't understand why I've made so much money while he's only gotten losses and an unfulfilled purchase, and his experience has only been a bad one. 
So yeah, I've helped a friend buy some. But it hasn't turned out good in his case. Not yet anyway.

Hardware wallets usually have a built-in button for spending, but mycelium and arcbit just make it so you don't have to connect them to a computer.

You can do it from any wallet that supports a function called BIP70 Payment Protocol. (I explain what that is in a comment on this post if you're interested.) These wallets include:
- Mycelium Wallet
- Edge Wallet (formerly Airbitz)
- Electrum Wallet
- Bitcoin Core
- BRD Wallet (breadwallet)
- BitPay Wallet
- Copay Wallet


No, because they are not a service, they are a company. But they are a centralized *company*, as are all companies that I'm aware of. It's not "wrong" to use them any more than it's "wrong" to use Visa, even though both are centralized. Bitpay offers a payment processor for companies to use to integrate bitcoin without learning how to actually *use* bitcoin. Bitpay takes a 1% fee for all purchases made using their processor, and they offer to convert all purchases to dollars for the companies who use them. Some people in this community think that goes against the spirit of bitcoin. I say meh, let them do what they want.


Yes. Your private keys are part of the twelve-word recovery key you write down when you set up your bitpay wallet. Bitpay's wallet uses an open source protocol called BIP39 which is widely supported among most popular bitcoin wallets; BIP39 gives you control over your private keys, therefore so does Bitpay.


I don't think blockchain.com's wallet works with Bitpay. They aren't listed as a working wallet on Bitpay's website. ([Here's]( the link I checked.) BTW you shouldn't use blockchain.com's wallet for large amounts because they hold your private keys. "Not your keys, not your bitcoin."


Electrum, because it is open source, widely supported, has a good developer team, gives you full control over your private keys, supports a lot of bitcoin's more obscure features, and is shortly expected to integrate a beta implementation of the new Lightning protocol for faster, cheaper, more secure bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2018-10-08 22:36:37
Also, to be a bit more technical, when users like us talk about "holding your own bitcoins" versus letting other people hold them, we're actually talking about holding the *private keys* to your bitcoins. Bitcoins never actually leave the bitcoin network, so when people talk about storing bitcoins on usb sticks and things like that, it's actually a metaphor -- the private keys are what you can store, not the bitcoins themselves. The private keys are what allow you to move your bitcoins around on the network, but the bitcoins themselves never leave the network. You can either store your private keys on your own device (which we call "holding your own bitcoins"), or on paper/plastic/etc, or you can let some other group hold them (which we call "using a custodial wallet"). And in general it's better to hold your own bitcoins than to let other people do it for you.
@_date: 2018-10-17 02:08:36
Many people have made a similar complaint regarding electrum's arguably premature integration of bc1 addresses, which were not compatible with any other wallet at the time. But this is how growth is achieved in Bitcoin, it's the classic chicken and egg problem: if you require an obscure feature, and have a popular service, demand increases for wallets that support that feature. The chicken produces the egg, but making that first chicken is tough and upsets the community for a while. More wallets appear to be integrating bip70 now, which is a good thing, because it's a good feature that wallets really ought to support. It cuts way down on the unintelligibility of addresses (because upon scanning, the user sees a URL, which is familiar) while also allowing wallets to communicate with servers for agreed upon fee rates. It also reduces the threat of address-replacing malware. Oh yeah and bip70 is also the simplest way right now to combine lightning invoices with traditional bitcoin addresses so that the user only sees one QR code. Their wallet can communicate with the server about whether or not it supports lightning, and the server will then provide either a lightning invoice or a bitcoin address depending on what the wallet supports. So this is a building block for seemlessly integrating lightning support (eventually). Bip70 is pretty important when you start to realize what it allows.

Miners are a resource that costs you and I nothing to obtain. We'd simply get new miners for free, because some guy with a server would see that he could make X number of dollars by mining with a pool on the original btc network, and he'd start mining it for the sake of that profit.

You asked several questions. The answer to one if them is: Just copy your private key into your will. Then your family can inherit your coins. This is already permitted in U.S. law.
Also: the supply of bitcoins will gradually go down over time due to private keys getting lost.

The hash you find has to be a hash of all the transactions in your block. If you let that change by accepting new transactions, your hash won't work anymore because it has to be a hash of All the transactions in the block, not just the ones you found initially before waiting for the block to fill up.
And it is important to broadcast your block quickly because other miners are trying to hash some of the same transactions. They don't have to find the Same hash as you did -- just one with enough leading zeros. There are billions of hashes with the appropriate number of zeros in front.
Also, while you Can find a hash and just sit on it for a while, you won't get any more of a block reward by doing so. The block reward will either be 12.5 btcs or fewer, depending on if the reward has halved or not. And you won't get additional fees because if you accept any additional transactions, you'll have to find a completely new hash. Plus, if you sit on it and wait, someone else might hash some of the same transactions that you have in your block, which would make your own block invalid whenever you get around to broadcasting it. So it's best to do so as quick as possible.

I agree, LN is better than 0-conf. One reason is because of the added security they bring, another is because of lower fees. A third reason is because it has better privacy.

Technically the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet that Hanspanzer referred you to *is* a node; it's an SPV node, which means it trusts miners to give it correct block data and doesn't verify info on the blockchain itself, but that's what most mobile wallets do anyway. It is possible to build a lightning wallet that is even more trusting -- one that connects by default to someone else's node and gets all its block data from that. Such a lightning wallet would not be a node, just a thin client (or a stratum-style wallet), but I don't think anyone has built such a lightning wallet yet.

You can manage your money online without a bank. Why is that a benefit? For one, because banks have higher fees. You can manage your money online with a Chase account, sure. But with Bitcoin, if you try to spend more than you have, there are no overdraft fees, the transaction simply doesn't go through. If you deposit $10,000 in one day, nobody files a report on you. If you want to leave all your money to your grandchild, or want to send it to someone else's account, there is no tax on that. It's better without a bank.

For several reasons. One is, bitcoin is not just an investment for me, it is a replacement for my bank. The alternative to holding my money in BTCs (for me anyway) is to hold them in USDs. I don't like the technical aspects of USD; its value goes down at least 2% per year on purpose, it's printed at will, and if you try to manage it online you're faced with the whims of whatever banking institution you use. Including fee gouging and paperwork if you try to move $10k. And slow confirmation times (sometimes I wait a full day for my paycheck to clear -- with no way to speed it up) and non-consensual reversible transactions (I've gotten burned several times due to my USD transactions getting reversed after-the-fact without my consent). Not to mention, banks are less secure from hackers. With bitcoin I know my money is as safe as I make it. I'm in control.
As to your question about value oscillation: if the value of each bitcoin oscillates within a predictable range for a while, I'm happy because that means my money's value has low volatility. If the value goes up, I'm happy because that means I have more free money. If the value goes down, I am not happy, but on the other hand I've already made enough money that I can probably cover any losses I incur unless it goes down to $1.5k or below. And if it did that, I would be ecstatic because I could afford to buy the dip.

You give a very interesting mathematical analysis of how interests rates work and I appreciate this contribution. Building on that, I think we also need to look at real-world data: how does bitcoin lending work right now? It does happen, and the lenders do make money. 
As an example, consider the margin trading use-case offered by several bitcoin exchanges, such as Poloniex and Gdax. If you decide to lend on margins, you effectively borrow btcs from people who have agreed to lend btcs out for the sake of margin traders. (You do not get the private keys, so they are not Actually yours, you just get to hit "buy" and "sell" buttons that are backed by those on-loan btcs.) Whatever happens next, whether you make money or lose money, the lenders get back the btcs you borrowed on margin, along with some extra which you agree to pay them before you trade on margins. 
Under this model, if you borrow 1 btc, your lender is guaranteed to receive 1 btc back AND a small increase on top of that. I believe they secure this guarantee by requiring you to post some money as collateral ahead-of-time in case you lose money on your margin trading. If that happens, the lenders keep your security deposit and get back whatever they loaned you, and you are responsible for any additional debt you acquired by losing money on a margin trade. (Of course, if you Make money on your margin trading, you may keep your profits -- which is why people do it -- but the lenders get their btcs back along with the extra bit agreed upon beforehand.)
So lending bitcoins currently does work, and a critical part is that you have to be able to post collateral to secure your loan. I suppose this same system could be modified for use with home loans and line-of-credit loans. Unsecured loans might become a thing of the past -- but secured btc loans currently do work and they should work for loans for any purpose, whether it be a home, a car, or a btc-backed credit card.
**Note: I think my description of how margin trading works was inaccurate. Here is a better description from Investopedia:

If it goes up in price, you owe money on the contract (because you lost your "bet"), but your actual bitcoin gained an equivalent amount of value, so in the end you've got the same amount of money you started out with. And vice-versa is true too: if bitcoin goes down in value, your actual coin is worth less money, but you gained an equivalent amount of money on the futures contract because you *won* the "bet." So you break even either way. Doing this every month allows you to accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services while escaping the volatility, because whichever way the volatility trends, you break even.

First, transaction fees are unlikely to remain what they are now in terms of satoshis per byte. Back when bitcoins were worth pennies, it was common to give a whole bitcoin for a transaction fee. Now that bitcoins are worth thousands, we give a mere thousand or so satoshis for a fee. If prices continue to increase, fees will likely be dominated in a smaller amount of satoshis, first hundreds, then dozens, then single digits.
Second, significantly more transactions will fit in each block, bringing down transaction costs. When Schnorr signatures are adopted, we'll be able to hugely reduce the size and therefore the cost of signature data, and thus gain up to a 40% increase in the number of transactions that can fit in each block. All of this will decrease the pressure to make onchain fees higher.
Third, most transactions will be done on lightning rather than on the blockchain, and on lightning fees are even lower because you don't need to pay miners. The remaining onchain transactions will mostly be channel rebalancing transactions, splicing transactions, and large transactions like where you buy a house or something. (A $14 fee for buying a house would be very livable, though I don't think fees will be that high usually.)
Fourth, transactions such as these can be batched together to further reduce the transaction size by combining inputs.
When all of those improvements are in, transaction fees shouldn't be that high for onchain transactions.

I use one regularly. All of my money is in btc and when I need to purchase food or gas or pay my bills I use a bitpay card and fund it by sending btcs to its special btc addresses. When I get a paycheck from work, I immediately spend 100% of it (or the closest to that that I can) buying btcs, and I use the bitpay card for all my day-to-day purchases. So far it's working mostly fine, although there have been three occasions where a glitch caused the card to not recognize when I put some money on it. (Two of those cases have been resolved; one, the most recent one, is still pending resolution.)

The core btc dev team is not an organization, it is just a name for the people whose code contributions are good enough that most people download them and use them. They aren't in control of bitcoin; if they write poor bitcoin software, there's nothing they can do to make people download it. Most people will only change to new bitcoin software if it's actually better than the one they were using before.
It is important to point out the difference between the consensus model bitcoin uses and the democratic model some people confuse it with. The consensus model is where you run the software you want and connect to the network you want. As more people do that, the network you are on grows, the software you like gets more usage, and, in the case of digital currency, the increase in usage typically reflects an increase in price. If other people don't want to run the software you like, or don't want to connect to the network you are on, or don't want to use the currency you use, they are free to do something different. This can indeed result in a loss in value, if people switch over from your preferred network and/or currency to a different one. If you want to, you can switch too. Consensus is the model where everyone may join whatever network they prefer -- the biggest one tends to have the highest aggregate value.
This is very different from a democratic model, where a majority of people may vote to impose changes on a minority. Bitcoin does not work that way because it is designed to make impositions impossible. No one can change the software you run without your consent -- not even a majority, and not even the core dev team (i.e. the people whose software tends to be the best and most widely used). Even if the majority of people change their wallets, and even if the "core dev team" writes a different version of bitcoin from the one you're using, no one can make you use the new wallet or the new protocol. No one can make you change the network you're on, no one can make you change to a different digital currency. You remain in complete control of what software you run, what network you connect to, and what currency you decide to use. You can't impose your preferences about this issue onto anyone else. If the majority changes, you may change with the majority if you wish, or stay behind with the minority -- though the value of your coin might collapse. If only a few people leave your network for a different one, they'll take their value with them, and you may leave with them if you wish, or you may stay with the network that has more users (and, likely, a higher value).
The consensus model is almost a complete free for all compared to the democratic model, and that has its advantages and disadvantages -- but part of what it means is that the "core dev team" have no control over bitcoin. "Core dev team" is just a name for the people whose software people tend to like and use. They're not an organization, they don't control bitcoin or the software you use, they're just developers who write software and say "Hey, try this new wallet" or "Hey, try this new protocol change" -- and if people like it, people start using it, and it becomes popular.
I hope that helps.

Yes, because anyone who can access your will can then take your coins. One way to reduce this risk is to divide up your private key into several parts (say, 3 sets of 8 characters each) and give the parts to trusted family members. Then, an evildoer can't steal your coins unless he manages to swindle three different trusted family members, which is unlikely, though still possible. And if you die, all your family has to do is combine the parts to get the full private key. Inheritance secured. And no one can take it in their own.

You probably don't want your health records to be kept on the bitcoin blockchain. It is a public record, for one thing, and most people want to keep their health records private. Anyone can view any information that is maintained on the bitcoin blockchain as if it was a public bulletin board. You probably don't want your health records on a public bulletin board in the middle of the town square for all to see; thus you probably also don't want it on the bitcoin blockchain, which is just as public.
Also, records that are kept on bitcoin's blockchain are there permanently. You can add new stuff, but not delete old stuff. Our health records change; they ought to be on a database where outdated information can be erased. Otherwise anyone could see embarrassing times in your health life long after they are no longer relevant. 
Also, bitcoin's blockchain requires you to hold onto your private keys. If you lose them, you can't be issued new ones for that old information, you have to put all your information on a new block (which is expensive) and get new private keys to that information. This is a hassle and it bloats the blockchain with constant information updates due to negligence, and these updates have to be stored forever by every node alongside the old records.
In short, bitcoin's blockchain, which is the largest and the most secure blockchain, is not an appropriate place to store health records.

When miners leave the network due to unprofitability, the difficulty of mining adjusts downward, making it less costly to mine. Thus the amount of money it costs to mine is usually a bit less than the amount of money you get as a reward for mining. If the reward amount is low, some miners will quit, the difficulty will get lower, and the cost to mine will get lower, until there's an equilibrium again.

You can't send a transaction in which one output has the witness data in the segwit field and the other has it in the standard field. The whole transaction gets one signature, and if you put that signature in the segwit field, it is a segwit transaction even if one of the outputs goes to a standard address.

Bitgold was proposed by Nick Szabo, but I don't think he ever actually coded it up under that name. The properties he described for it seem incredibly similar to bitcoin; it seems possible to me that, when he started coding it, he and his team changed things as they ran into implementation problems, and the end-result was different enough from the bitgold proposal that they called it bitcoin and released it under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin clearly went through a significant period of coding before its release; I wouldn't be surprised if he started in the mid 2000s and only got it ready for initial release as an alpha project by the late 2000s. Most of the development has been done since that time, especially by other coders.

Yeah, and that process can be automated if you're using a wallet with constant connectivity (such as a custodial wallet).


Personally, I'd start getting uncomfortable once about $75 was in a custodial wallet. If I was a merchant expecting to get more than that pretty frequently, I'd buy a dedicated computer or a raspberry pi and run a self-hosted lightning wallet on it, and give it a stable internet connection. Some people might install a lightning wallet on Amazon web services as an alternative to running it on your own dedicated hardware, but I think having it on your own computer would be cheaper and safer.

I ended up sending someone a lightning payment to send me an onchain payment of an equivalent amount. This gave me inbound capacity. Submarine swaps are expected to enable this exact behavior to be done in a trustless, guaranteed way, which is a solution for merchants. That's one reason why it is important to enable submarine swaps before lightning gets out of beta. Also, merchants can be expected to have the kind of node that people will want to connect directly to -- and direct connections from a buyer to a merchant are a second way to acquire inbound capacity.

If you use an ordinary debit or credit card to pay for your Cheetos, your purchase goes into "pending" status for 1-3 days. And you don't have to sit there and wait for the bank to confirm the pending purchase. The store knows that it isn't worth it to most people to go call their bank afterward and cancel the transaction. If for some reason you cancelled the transaction every time you bought Cheetos, the gas station manager would just refuse to sell you Cheetos. It's the exact same with bitcoin, except the confirmation time is Much faster (10 minutes versus 1-3 days) and there's no one you can call to cancel the transaction (you have to set a fee of zero for that -- or do a double spend).

Presumably most new users will buy their coins on an exchange. When they move those coins off the exchange, that will likely be in an onchain transaction. This onchain transaction can be sent in such a way that it creates a new payment channel to the user's lightning wallet and sends funds to it. Voila! They have funds on the lightning network.
Moreover, there is chatter that -- eventually -- a future upgrade to the lightning software could make it possible to create payment channels as part of a lightning payment without paying onchain transaction fees. I'm not entirely read up on the technical aspects of how this works yet, but if you want to research it google "channel factories." It has something to do with the fact that bitcoin's scripting language allows for the creation of certain types of smart contracts, and these contracts can be enforced via lightning payments; payment channels are themselves a form of bitcoin smart contract, and thus a lightning payment can theoretically be coded up in such a way that, as an integral part of the payment contract, a new payment channel is created. Moreover, bitcoin's smart contracting system would secure and validate these payment channels in the same way it secures and validates lightning payments -- and thus these payment channels would be valid and usable even before actually being included in a block on the blockchain.
Some of that summary may be incorrect due to my not fully understanding this proposal yet, and, at least to me, it opens up almost as many questions as it answers. So take my attempt to summarize it with a grain of salt. But if this upgrade goes through and if it works as I've attempted to describe it, perhaps that could be an additional way to onboard people to the lightning network while minimizing the necessity of onchain payments.

Bitcoin utxos can be laundered by sending multiple utxos to the same address, then sweeping that address. Now your "tainted bitcoin" has a new utxo id that matches the utxo id of a bunch of other bitcoins, and there is no way to figure out which one is the tainted one. This simple method of laundering bitcoins means that, in order to reliably reject any bitcoin that might have once been tainted, the number of bitcoins you'd have to refuse to accept would grow continually, making it infeasible.

In my opinion, the scarcity of contentious hardforks in their communities is evidence of centralization. Their software, especially Dash, aren't sufficiently immutable to be trustworthy, in my opinion.
Zcash also has an additional problem that Monero and Dash don't have: the original developer relied upon one method of encrypting all the transaction data, and that method was backdoor-able. He says he took great pains to prove that he didn't include a backdoor, but ultimately it seems to me that his proof requires us to trust the word of the reporter he hired, who attested that their developer really really really did everything he could to verify that there was no backdoor. But I don't think we have sufficient reasons to trust that reporter, and therefore I suspect there may be a backdoor in the zcash protocol. If there is, it completely undermines the privacy of the coin, in my opinion.
Oh and Dash has a problem that Monero and Zcash don't have: Dash's privacy method relies upon masternodes being able to add transactions to the blockchain without proof of work, and I suspect that that's both unsafe and unprivate. Moreover, it could eventually introduce censorship, if masternode operators become untrustworthy.

One way that atomic swaps can help with privacy involves an assumption about certain altcoins. There are several altcoins that claim to have built-in privacy features. They include Monero, Zcash, and Dash. If any of them become atomically swappable with bitcoin, and an easy app for it is made that doesn't involve custodial control -- and if you make a leap of logic and decide that these coins are really trustworthy and private, even though they have massive problems -- then you can use atomic swaps to swap your bitcoins trustlessly for these privacy-focused altcoins, then immediately swap back for fresh, untainted bitcoins. That's the hope anyways.

Once per day is probably fine for some people. But for other people the option to immediately withdraw your earnings up to the current moment is a real perk. And it is your money, after all. For Uber workers and other participants in the gig economy it makes sense. If it becomes an option, people might take on a night of ubering (for example) because they have an immediate expense -- a bill due tomorrow, for example. Withdrawing without waiting for Friday, or next Friday, or next month, is awesome.
But since it is your money I think it ought to be an option for everyone. What sense does it make to be required to wait to withdraw money you just earned? If there is no compelling case for waiting, then lighting's instantness is simply better than the standard model of waiting. Lightning makes it possible for companies to offer instant use of your earnings up to the current moment with no risk -- like Amazon Prime Shipping for your salary. What employee wouldn't want that if it was offered?
Also imagine how that could incentive employees to show up on time.

It's possible to create tools to transfer lightning channels to a new device. The android wallet known as "Bitcoin Lightning Wallet" has such a tool, and the developer charges a fee to use it.

So, from this perspective, one Could say the problem is with Eclair rather than with the LN itself; but on the other hand, the LN spec sheet (BOLT) does not specify that compatible implementations must have a built-in tool for channel transfer, so, from that persepctive, one could say that the problem is with the LN itself rather than with Eclair.

Behind the scenes there are things called "buy orders" and "sell orders" on a platform called Gdax, which is owned by Coinbase. Customers on Gdax can set a "buy order" where they say how many bitcoins they want to buy at what price. For example, they can set a buy order to buy 10 bitcoins if the price drops to $6,300, and then just wait for their buy order to be filled. "Sell orders" are similar except the reverse -- that's when someone says how many bitcoins they want to sell at what price. For example, they can set a sell order to sell .5 bitcoins if the price rises to $7300. Whenever there is a sell order that matches a buy order (or offers a better deal), the transaction happens instantly. Otherwise, the orders get placed on the order book and the system just waits.
Besides Gdax, which is meant for professional traders and hobbyists, Coinbase also has a "storefront" where you can place a buy order that will automatically get you some bitcoins from a sell order that is closest to the current market price. For this service, which makes it so you don't have to interact with the Gdax platform, Coinbase takes a fee.

Lightning is very useful for small payments; eventually it will likely get better for some larger payments, but right now its beta status and hot wallet concerns are keeping it limited mostly to low value payments.

Coinbase matches up a customer who wants to sell bitcoins with a customer who wants to buy them, then takes a fee when they make a trade. So if Jim sells Bob a bitcoin for $20,000 over Coinbase, Coinbase gets a fee from that -- let's say $50. Now, even if Bob's bitcoin drops in value by half, Coinbase still made $50 off that trade. They probably cashed it out already. Coinbase makes money by taking fees for facilitating trades -- not by buying bitcoins for $1 and selling them for $2.

It's a better analogy but still a poor one for precisely the reason you mentioned. An even better analogy is debit cards/fiat. At least with debit cards there is no interest due. The biggest problem with the debit card analogy is that with a debit card your money is deposted into a bank where you don't control it anymore \-\- on the LN you deposit it into a standard bitcoin multisig address where you have control of your own private keys and a signed smart contract from your counterparty so that you can move your money out even without their cooperation.

Lightning payments confirm instantly.


One shouldn't assume that, one should check to see if they are balanced or not. If you can send them a payment, then they have inbound capacity. If they can send you a payment, then they have outbound capacity.


That does not follow. If you run out of inbound capacity it is easy to get onchain coins (just close your exhausted channel), and if they need to acquire more inbound capacity there are ways to get more, using those onchain coins.


There are no such things as lightning coins; lightning uses bitcoins and litecoins, and they are not virtual coins but real ones in their own wallets. Also, cashing out from lightning to onchain is as fast as any other onchain transaction.

Coinbase does transaction batching when they send bitcoins out of their network. Yours is in a queue; when a bunch of other transactions are ready to go out at the same time, they'll send you your bitcoins. They do batching because it costs them less money to send a bunch of transactions at once then it does to send them all separately.

I suspect that channel rebalancing is part of the problem. If a merchant is selling $1 coffee and opens a channel to the network with $100 capacity, he will run out of capacity after 100 purchases (fewer than that actually). He needs to rebalance his channel to receive more payments, and there is no automatic way to do that yet. This means that, currently at least, merchants have to do relatively frequent manual maintenance of their channel, which no merchant wants. It is possible to create automatic solutions for channel rebalancing, but they aren't out yet.

The app "bitcoin lightning wallet" lets you send and receive lightning payments. There is no watchtower yet other than this: whenever you open the app while online, it will check to see if any of your counterparties have broadcasted an outdated channel state; and if they have, and you're within the contractual time limits, it will enforce the penalty for you and get you your funds plus your counterpartys's. That's exactly what a watchtower does, particularly if you run the app on a device that is always online.
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:58:04


True. To me, that still counts. Apparently, you disagree, but that's okay. To me, "instant confirmation" is not the same thing as "instant confirmation on the blockchain." Here's part of why I say lightning payments confirm instantly: lightning payments remind me of trustless money orders; when you pay for a money order, the thing you're paying for is essentially a check from an organization that definitely has the money to pay the recipient. The money order is not money itself, but merely payment information which is signed by the money-holder, which the recipient can settle anytime before the expiration date (which, in lightning, is indefinite). And if you hand that money order to a merchant for a product, to me it counts as an instant payment, because they give you your product instantly and treat the money order like it's as good as cash. If a money order is as good as cash, then a lightning payment is as good as an onchain payment.


They can either send more bitcoins outward or close the channel. I infer that you and I disagree about whether or not this is an effective solution; I think it is, and you seem to think it is not. Here is the reason you give for why it is ineffective:


When a business sends a lightning payment to pay a rebalancing service to give them incoming capacity, that incoming capacity arrives instantly. The onchain funds arrive after sufficient confirmations, likely in about an hour. If a business receives so much money in that hour that they run out of incoming capacity again before they can set up another channel, they are doing mighty fine, and should probably open multiple channels and stagger their need for rebalancing. But even if staggering their rebalancing across multiple channels was not a solution (and it is), a scenario where a company receives more money per hour than a lightning channel can handle (with rebalancing) is extremely unlikely.


Agreed. That is why I say a watchtower is built into every node. A private watchtower, for you alone.


Not necessarily. A watchtower program can be run on any device you own that has a stable internet connection, OR you can outsource it to someone who Does have a stable internet connection. A watchtower program is very simple to implement; in its simplest form, a watchtower could be designed to watch a user-selected onchain channel (or several of them), and, if any payment gets broadcast from that channel, it should broadcast the latest state it knows about. If the latest state in your personal watchtower matches the state that was just broadcast to the mempool, well and good, you haven't been defrauded and no harm has been done; but if the one in the mempool is fraudulent, your own personal watchtower will broadcast the correct one, which has a sooner locktime, and voila, your watchtower saved you from fraud. Such a watchtower does not need any new tech; just IFTTT and access to the blockchain.
Also, "beta software" has more than one meaning, and often refers to software that is buggy and has user experience issues. Lightning is beta in this latter sense, and this latter sense is common among software developers.

Segwit doesn't need greater adoption for lightning to fully work. All it needs is to be possible, which it is. Nonetheless, segwit adoption is good, and if you want to promote it, keep in mind that all lightning wallets are segwit wallets too -- so just get people to use lightning and segwit adoption will continue to grow. But one thing we can't do as node operators is force people to use segwit/lightning. We can encourage it, but we can't force people to do something they don't want to do. Non-segwit transactions will always be possible.

Lol, sorry for the complexity of the post; I was trying to give you some additional details because it sounds like you're interested in some of the more technical aspects of how lightning works, and that's admirable. Since I've confused you, let me try to unconfuse you a bit.
If you've spent all the money in your lightning channel, you can pay to refill it with a standard bitcoin transaction. Then, you can make lightning payments again. Or, if you're a merchant and your channel has received so many payments that it's full and can't take any more, you can use some of those coins to open a new channel; then you'll be able to receive payments again.
Those two situations -- where your channel runs out of money or it gets too full -- are what people mean when they talk about channel degradation, and right now the solutions to them are not automatic but manual. These manual solutions can be automated so that channel degradation no longer happens, but right now I'm unaware of any automatic solutions, so the only solutions right now involve manually sending some coins out of your channel or into your channel, depending on whether it's empty or full.

Lightning is a network of smart contracts.

They don't have access to any other assets -- just bitcoins and litecoins. (Though eventually I expect other coins will be added too.)

I believe the term channel degradation is a synonym for exhausting a channel, which can happen in two ways. If you are a merchant who uses lightning, you are likely to have a relatively high number of payments coming your way, because you're selling stuff. Each payment exhausts your channel's incoming capacity a little bit, and after a while, if you don't do any channel rebalancing, you will have no more incoming capacity. The result is that you won't be able to accept incoming payments unless you do some channel rebalancing. There are several ways to do channel rebalancing. I'll discuss three ways: the onchain payment method, the new channel method, and the negative fees method.
The onchain payment method is where you send a lightning payment outward to a swap provider; in return, the swap provider will send an onchain payment of the same amount (minus a fee) to your wallet. Outward payments increase your incoming capacity. For every dollar you send outward through your channel, a dollar can also come inward through that channel. 
The new channel method is very similar, except you send a lightning payment to a service that makes a deal with you where, when you send them coins via lightning, they'll use those coins (minus a fee) to open a new channel to you -- thus almost doubling your original incoming capacity, because your original channel now has all its coins on the side that allows incoming payments, and you also have a new channel opened with the new channel provider, and thus payments can be routed to you through that channel as well.
The negative fees method is where you yourself begin using your channels to route payments for other people; and if one of your channels has no more incoming capacity, well, that means it has high outgoing capacity, so what you can do is offer to pay people a few satoshis to route their payments through your node in the outgoing direction. That way, as payments go outward through you, you'll send coins to the other side of your channel, which gives you incoming capacity. This is called "negative fees" because normal lightning fees are charges which you charge people to route their payments for them; but if you're trying to incentivize people to send payments outward through your node, you can offer a "negative fee," where instead of charging them a few satoshis, you Give them a few satoshis so that their outward payment goes through your node and gives you incoming capacity. The fees, for the sender, are effectively negative -- they make their lightning payment cost less, or even might make it profitable to send money through your node, to increase its incoming capacity.
So those are some of the ways to deal with exhausted channels as a merchant. Meanwhile, for consumers, there are other methods that match their use cases. A consumer is a bit different from a merchant; one difference between these two types of bitcoin users is that merchants receive bitcoins more frequently than consumers, who mostly don't receive bitcoins except by purchasing them. Consumers also tend to have more outgoing payments than many merchants do; consumers are buyers, merchants are sellers; consumers are primarily known for spending bitcoins, merchants are primarily known for receiving them in exchange for a product or service. As a result, consumers are likely to have more outgoing payments than many merchants, because consumers buy stuff more often than they sell stuff. And so, for a consumer, they are more likely to run out of outgoing capacity than they are to run out of incoming capacity. And for a consumer, a good solution for that situation is to open a new channel and fund it with more bitcoins; or, sell something via lightning and acquire outgoing capacity by receiving payments to your channel; or, if that doesn't work, you can pay a swap provider to send you a lightning payment in return for an onchain payment. All of these methods allow both merchants and consumers to increase their incoming capacity and/or outgoing capacity as needed, and are solutions against channel degradation.

Yes. Eventually there is a plan to make it so that you and your counterparty can both do the initial funding together, and when that starts happening -- well, your channel limit will *still* be set by the intial funding, but if your counterparty provides funds too that will make the initial funding higher than if you do it all by yourself. Currently each participant in lightning has to do the initial funding of their channel all by themselves -- but there is a plan to fix this bug before lightning is out of beta.

Those are bitcoins you're using. Just as putting coins into Mycelium doesn't turn them into "Mycelium coins," so also putting coins on the lightning network doesn't turn them into lightning coins. If someone told you that "Mycelium coins" do exist because he sends coins from Mycelium to other people all the time, you should tell him that those are bitcoins he's sending, not some other coin. Well, the same goes for the lightning network. There are no "LN coins." Just bitcoins and litecoins.

You can still do transactions even if 90% of the miners leave. I believe 10% of the current hashrate gets us blocks every hour and fifty minutes on average (until the difficulty adjusts, so it's only temporary), which is still faster than the day or two it takes PayPal or Visa to move a transaction from "pending" to "finalized". Not to mention, if 90% of miners leave, new people will take their place because of the high profitability of mining BTC. It'll be like, "Now's my chance!" for anyone with a decent server.
Remember: miners come to this chain for free. They do it without charging anyone because they get paid to do it by the built-in methods. If some miners leave, those beautiful profits will call others to mine, and some of the ones who leave will come back quickly just like what happened with bch.

You can stream invoices to a wallet and, theoretically, set it to automatically pay them under certain conditions. E.g. suppose you are paying for milliamps of electricity. You could put a certain number of satoshis in an address, equal to the amount you are willing to spend on electricity that month, and set the wallet that controls that address to automatically approve invoices for that address but only if the electricity company has supplied the milliamp you're paying for and only if your gps says you are at home.

Recently I rebalanced a channel and it involved sending a lightning payment to someone who sent me an equivalent amount onchain. The method I used involved trusting the rebalancing service, but swap technology should make this trustless before LND is out of beta. The idea is that rebalancing services need both inbound capacity and outbound capacity, and thus they can use full channels in either direction. So it's okay to push a channel over to them -- they send enough money outward that they can use that channel easily. There are also other possible types of rebalancing services other than ones which send you money onchain in exchange for a lightning payment. Other kinds can do things like open a channel to you if you open a channel to them. Or, you could just use your channels that have no more inbound capacity to buy goods and services via lightning -- which increases your inbound capacity.

If you define the development team as "everyone who contributes to the software," then your statement is circular.

Bitcoin uses its own network nodes to process transactions, it doesn't even use standard internet servers for that. It only uses the internet for sending transaction data to peers, and the internet can easily handle this data-passing at scale, because the bits of data our network needs to send are tiny -- orders of magnitude smaller than webpages, which the internet easily serves billions of per day.

The video discusses methods and application possibilities for various types of swaps, especially submarine swaps and atomic swaps. Swaps are where you trustlessly trade various types of data, including crypto-to-crypto payments (e.g. bitcoins for litecoins -- swaps of this kind can be done either onchain or over lightning), onchain payments for lightning payments, lightning payments for onchain payments, and crypto payments (either kind, onchain or lightning) for torrent data.
The author also showed some demos on the testnet involving the code he has already written and is optimizing, and he shared which forms of swaps he is currently working on. The hope is that submarine swaps (both onchain-for-lightning and lightning-for-onchain) and atomic swaps (crypto-for-crypto) will both be included in LND before it gets out of beta. Based on the demos he showed, it looks very likely to me that he will finish his project in time.
The author also discussed potential applications for swap technology. Among other things, the trustless crypto-for-torrent swap (which he called an HTLCDASH swap, and which no one is currently working on, apparently) could enable trustlessly paying for downloads without ever having to worry that your counterparty might not send you the data you are paying for. The data would be divided up into chunks (like a torrent) and included in the smart contract preimage so that you pay could verify and pay for each torrent-like chunk with microtransactions, in a guaranteed and trustless way, so that it is impossible for you to pay for incorrect data.
Also, the submarine swap tech could allow exchanges to trustlessly outsource the job of onboarding people to the lightning network. So, for example, if someone wanted to withdraw bitcoins from an exchange via lightning, but the exchange doesn't have lightning integrated internally, they could trustlessly outsource the lightning withdrawal to a swap provider -- meaning they send him your payment onchain and he sends you an equivalent amount over lightning, without anyone being at risk and without the exchange having to integrate lightning. The same thing could work in reverse if you wanted to deposit over lightning -- the exchange could give you an invoice created by the swap provider, and you could pay that invoice, and -- trustlessly -- the exchange would receive an onchain payment from the swap provider.
Exchanges could also use swap technology to trade balances with merchants. I.e. if a merchant has a channel that is depleted in the incoming direction, so that he can no longer receive payments from customers, he can trustlessly trade his depleted channel for a full one with an exchange -- and thus start receiving payments again. (Exchanges hopefully won't mind getting channels that are depleted in the incoming direction, because they need to send bitcoins "out" to their customers very often, something that merchants rarely need to do -- and such channels still work for that purpose.)
He also discussed crypto-to-crypto swaps (e.g. litecoin to bitcoin and vice versa), showed some demos, and indicated that the code for paying someone over the lightning network in litecoin and having them receive bitcoin over the lightning network -- without you having to do anything special -- will be integrated into LND before it goes out of beta.
Lastly he shared some limitations of this technology and coding challenges that still need to be overcome. Among these, he indicated that swap providers will need to have a lot of liquidity, which is a startup challenge. Moreover, some of these swap tech applications involve onchain payments, which are slow and expensive, thus bringing some of the problems of onchain payments to lightning payments -- which no one wants. He is still working on overcoming or at least minimizing these limitations, and a lot of this is still theoretical, but he did show enough practical testnet demos that it looks like the code will be ready -- at least for submarine swaps and atomic swaps -- by the time LND is released.

Another possible solution: people could pool their money and create lending contracts where each loaner is paid interest for providing security for money lent to a third party.
Also worth mentioning: secured bitcoin loans actually already exist. Exchanges call them "margin lending" -- where you are allowed to "sort of" borrow bitcoins (they are kept on the exchange and you don't get the private keys) and pay them back later after you've made trades. If you "lose" these semi-borrowed bitcoins by making unwise trades, the lender buys them back using fiat money, which you must provide in advance at an amount that is capable of covering your potential losses.

The difficulty does not increase all the time, sometimes it goes down. Bitcoin's software is designed to adjust the difficulty of mining so that it is always profitable. As a consequence, sometimes the difficulty goes downward. If bitcoin ever reaches a point where the energy consumed outweighs the profits to be made off it, the software can't know that the reason is because of high energy costs, it just knows that profitability went down. Following its protocol, it will adjust the difficulty downward, and as a side effect that will lower the energy requirements until it is profitable again. This is how it preserves what efficiency it has -- the software makes sure that miners, on the whole, are never using their energy in an unprofitable way.

If transaction fees drop, miners will get less money, and a bunch of them will stop mining. The difficulty will adjust downward, making it easier to mine, and some people will mine for the (lower) reward. If some of the previous miners jump back in again, the difficulty will go up again, and it will keep doing that to keep an average rate of 6 blocks per hour. The reward may be lower, but the difficulty will be lower too, so some people will start mining again for the (lower) reward.

1. No, miners can keep creating new blocks after the maximum amount of bitcoins has been reached. There just won't be new bitcoins in those blocks.
2. Right now, 12.5 bitcoins are produced with each new block, and a few old bitcoins are also given to the miners in transaction fees in each block. Every four years, the number of new bitcoins generated in each block gets cut in half. It started out so that each block would create 50 new bitcoins, then it got halved to 25 new bitcoins, right now it's at 12.5 new bitcoins, and it will keep on getting cut in half every four years until all new bitcoins have been mined.
3. Pools find hashes, not blocks. A block is a group of transactions that are added to the blockchain by miners. Before they are added to the blockchain, they float around in something called a "mempool." They don't need to be "found" in this mempool, there are simple ways to order them based on several factors, including which ones offer miners the highest transaction fees as an incentive to be put into the next block. Miners just pick the ones that offer them the highest fees and group them together. Then, they find a "hash," which is a special number which can be used to view all the transaction data in the block along with some other metadata. They broadcast this hash to the rest of the network, which uses the hash number to reveal the transactions in the block, and then each node in the network verifies that the transactions in the block are valid. BTW any miner can try to find a hash for any group of transactions that haven't been added to the blockchain yet. The first one to find it gets the block reward.
4. Miners will keep on going after all the coins are mined. Miners are not just paid in new coins, they are also paid transaction fees. When the new coins are gone, they will still mine to get the transaction fees. The system is designed so that, initially, the amount that miners get from transaction fees is less than the amount they get from new coins, but then, gradually, it will come to be equal to the amount that they get from new coins, and then, a bit later, it will be more than they get from new coins, and then, finally, it will replace the new coins completely as the only way to get money from mining. Regarding power cost, bitcoin's software is designed to adjust the difficulty of mining so that it is always profitable. As a consequence, sometimes the difficulty goes downward. If bitcoin ever reaches a point where the energy consumed outweighs the profits to be made off it, the software can't know that the reason is because of high energy costs, it just knows that profitability went down. Following its protocol, it will adjust the difficulty downward, and as a side effect that will lower the energy requirements until it is profitable again.

1) There are two answers to this question. One answer is that other upgrades to bitcoin are still being developed and need to be ready before we hardfork to bigger blocks in order to minimize the number of hardforks. A second answer can be summarized with the single word decentralization. Keeping the block size small helps more people contribute to the network using ordinary computers. If the block size gets bigger, you'll need a faster and bigger computer to run the backend bitcoin software, and some people will drop off or just won't want to get involved because of the cost of buying a high-end computer (or maybe even several). This leads to centralization, which is unsafe because it lets a small number of big-computer people control the network.
2) Increasing the block size allows more data to be processed in a shorter space of time, specifically transaction data. Every transaction in bitcoin is about 226 bytes right now. By keeping the block size at 1 megabyte (and including about 10% Segwit transactions), a few blocks ago we were able to fit around 2600 transactions in a 1.08 mb block. Since blocks are processed every 10 minutes, this means we are often processing about 260 transactions per minute, or an average of 4.3 transactions per second. To get more people using bitcoin, we'll need to allow more transactions per second, and at some point that will include larger blocks. But hopefully not until we have other upgrades ready to go in at the same time, to limit the number of hard forks.
3) One benefit of second layers is that they can do more transactions per second without clogging the blockchain. Some second layer solutions actually already exist. As just one example, btc exchanges use a second layer solution to manage trades that occur between users of their exchange. If Joe on Coinbase transfers 1 bitcoin to Mike on Coinbase, this doesn't get broadcast to the blockchain because the money is still in the same Coinbase-owned address. Coinbase just uses a second-layer spreadsheet to change the balance that Mike and Joe own on their records. Updating a spreadsheet like that happens instantly and doesn't clog the blockchain. The goal of some second-layer solutions, like the lightning network, is to make this type of instant-transaction functionality available to everyone without trusting a third party like Coinbase.
4) No.
5) We do understand the cause. The growth of transaction fees is a function of low supply and high demand. There is high demand to create transactions on the blockchain right now, and low supply of space in each block. Users may set a transaction fee to incentivize miners to put their transaction into the next block, and miners tend to prioritize the transactions which offer them the highest fees. Since there is high demand right now from institutional investors getting into this game, they are offering miners high fees to get their transactions broadcasted quickly, and it is hard for "little guys" to keep up.
I hope that helps. Keep in mind that the developer community has a roadmap to make second-layer solutions available, and it will likely happen in a year or two. Have patience. Cheap scaling won't happen immediately. The internet was slow too, when it had only been around this long. (source for that last claim:

Fees are still optional. There are wallets that will pay your fees for you if you let them hold your private keys (gdax is one), and moreover if you hold your own private keys (which is safest), you can get low fees by waiting to transact until the mempool clears.

What's written in the code is not "every 10 minutes a block shall be found," but rather a probability function involving a process called a Poisson process. You can read more about it here:  The short version is, there is about a 63% probability that a new block will be found within 10 minutes after the last one, a 95% probability that it will be found within 30 minutes after the last one, and a .03% probability that it will be found after 60 or more minutes.
As to your other questions: the difficulty level of mining adjusts every 2016 blocks, which is about every 2 weeks. This is not related to filling the block to 1 mb, they can do that pretty much instantly because they already know what unconfirmed transactions are in the mempool and which ones they've already grouped together into a block. And, there are currently blocks over 1 mb because of the Segwit upgrade which went through on July 31st. One of the things it did was make it possible for the network to process significantly bigger blocks. The biggest block that has been mined so far was 1.6 megabytes. (In case you're interested, it was block 493182, details available here: blockchain.info/block-height/493182)

In think this idea eliminates proof-of-work. Without that, there's no way to verify which chain is correct.
Let me explain. First, let's call the new, "compressed" block Genesis-Nova. Now -- suppose a bad actor starts up a bunch of custom nodes right at the time a compression happens, but his Genesis-Nova doesn't match the one the real bitcoin network has. His looks almost identical, except it removes 200 BTCs from someone's address and adds it to his own. You, a new user, set up a node right about this time and it starts reaching out for network connections. It finds a bunch of the real bitcoin nodes, but also a bunch of the bad actor's. Without the ability to see which chain is longer and has more proof-of-work, how does this new node know which chain is the valid one? They both consist of only one block.

No, because a mass payment channel has some properties in common with a multisignature address, including this: these mechanisms automatically keep all funds locked until specified conditions are fulfilled. In a multisignature address, the conditions are that a sufficient number of signatures have to sign each transaction. In a payment channel, the condition is that the timelock has run out, or both parties agree to settle at the same time.

I don't think a core developer is what you think it is. Bitcoin Core is a computer program that combines open-source bitcoin wallet software with open-source bitcoin node software. This program is popular, but it is not by any means necessary for bitcoin to function, no more than Coinbase or any other company that makes software for use on the bitcoin network. The company who makes this software doesn't "control" anything other than their wallet and node software -- they don't control bitcoin and can't unilaterally change the consensus rules. A majority of bitcoin users have to agree to use software that changes bitcoin's rules in order for a change to take place. Bitcoin Core is a great program (I'm running a copy as we speak), but it's by no means the power behind Bitcoin. It's just one piece of software in an ocean of competitors.

Also, mining for bitcoins is a reasonably efficient way to use your electricity compared to nonproductive uses. Using your electricity to run a miner turns your electricity into money. Using your electricity to, say, power up your television actually helps you be unproductive. Most other ways to use your electricity are similarly less productive than bitcoin. If you use your electricity on nonproductive things, you are being less efficient than if you used it to earn money.

In Segwit transactions the witness data of your transaction is not counted towards your fee size. As a result, even if you pay the same amount of fees per byte, 4x fewer bytes get "counted" as part of the transaction cost. If you check the total amount of satoshis paid per transaction (not per byte) pre-segwit versus post-segwit, you should see that your Segwit transactions cost 4x less.

It's simpler than what you are thinking. Step one: download a wallet that has the lightning network integrated. Step two: get your coins from an exchange or employer that supports the lightning network, and have them send coins to your lightning network address. Step three: spend some of those coins on the lightning network, keep the rest as savings. Step four: repeat step three. I don't think you ever need to cash out of the lightning network.

Payments channels have been part of the software ever since Satoshi released the first bitcoin client. The lightning network just creates a network of payment channels. Without a network, payment channels only allow you to transact with people or companies who have explicitly entered a channel with you. With the lightning network, you can transact with people who aren't in a channel with you, so long as they are connected to the lightning network.

You may find the following explanation helpful (I wrote it for my personal use):
I keep telling people that they need to use a wallet that lets them control their own private keys, and I also let them know that I personally use Mycelium. But mycelium doesn’t actually show you the private keys to the wallets it generates. Instead, it shows you something called a BIP32 Root Key, which is a code that starts with xprv. This key can also be called a master private key. A randomly generated master private key is used by mycelium (and many other wallets as well) to generate hundreds of single use wallets in a way that makes it easy to make a backup. With a master private key, you don’t need to export or reuse a public address or even know the private keys to your bitcoin addresses; you can let the wallet handle all that on the backend, and it will give you a new public address every time you want to receive btcs, while using the private keys in the background for when you want to send btcs to someone else.
However, since I keep telling people to control your own private keys, I want to be sure to know how to access them, since mycelium doesn’t show them (though you do still have them when you use that wallet -- invisibly). One way you can access your mycelium private keys is using the BIP32 Root Key (or master private key) and putting it into a tool that generates the public and private keys for all the single use addresses that mycelium generates automatically (BTW these are sometimes called “child addresses). What follows are instructions for accessing this xprv key and using it with a tool to access your actual private keys.
Currently, the BIP32 Root Key used in your mycelium android app can be accessed in the Accounts tab by tapping an account under “My HD Accounts,” then tapping the three dots in the top right, then Export, then Yes, then Show: Private. Then longpress the area that the app says to longpress. The BIP32 Root Key is they key that shows up and starts with xprv. You will be copy-pasting this into a tool I’m about to tell you about.
Ian Coleman wrote a tool for generating hd wallet addresses, and it can be used to find out the private keys for your Mycelium wallet addresses. His tool is called the Mnemonic Code Converter, and it is named for its primary feature, which is recovering or creating an hd wallet by typing in some mnemonic keywords that many btc wallets instruct you to write down during setup as a way of backing up your bitcoin addresses. The tool is associated with BIP39 primarily, but also with BIP32 and BIP44. Mr. Coleman’s tool can be accessed at this page and run offline:
To access your mycelium private keys using this tool, simply copy the BIP32 Root Key that you obtained earlier, and paste it into the BIP32 Root Key field in that tool. Then click on the BIP32 tab under the Derivation Path heading. Voila! You can see all your mycelium wallet’s public keys and private keys.

My computer couldn't download 1 gigabyte every 10 minutes. Remember that in order to use bitcoin without trusting a third party, users must be able to run their own nodes on the network. Most network operators today couldn't download a 1 gb block every 10 minutes and process all the transactions in that block before the next one arrived. I know I couldn't do that, and most other "little guys" couldn't either. Only big companies could afford the necessary requirements for 1 gb blocks -- fiber optic bandwidth and terahertz cpus. 1 mb blocks help you protect your money by letting you decide what network to be on using your own home computer.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:24:05
To me it is a big deal because I want to control my own money. If I wanted someone else to control it, I wouldn't be running a node, I'd just store it on Coinbase. But the beautiful thing about bitcoin is, everyone gets to make their own decision. If you don't mind trusting a third party to control your node, feel free to use their service. It's your money and your node; use them how you like to, store them where you want to.

@_date: 2017-11-26 15:10:05
Yes, and not only do I think that is quite rational, I think that if you do a fair risk assessment including the percentage of exchanges that have lost user money in the last 9 years compared to the amount of money you can save in 9 years on tx fees -- the math checks out. IMO my $200 is at low risk compared to the amount I'm saving in transaction fees. BTW I buy almost everything with bitcoins, from my rent to my groceries to my gas and fast food, so I make a lot of transactions that could otherwise be $.30+ apiece.

Just to add to this, the ability to make transactions via SMS is making steady progress. For example, Samurai is a free wallet which supports the ability to remotely send commands to your bitcoin wallet via SMS. Right now, it doesn't appear to support making transactions via SMS, but you can retrieve your private keys or destroy your wallet remotely. I think it's only a matter of time before someone makes an app where you can do those things but also send transactions.

I store money in at least two wallets depending on what features I may want at any given time. I intentionally keep a little bit in an exchange because they have a feature that I sometimes want -- they'll pay your transaction fee to send coins to other bitcoin addresses. Yes, there is technically a risk that if the exchange stops working I could lose $200 or whatever, but I think it's a relatively low risk for that amount of money and the benefit outweighs that risk: I can spend up to $200 in bitcoin (or whatever is in my exchange wallet) for free. This is why I can continue to tell people that setting a bitcoin miner fee is completely optional, that sometimes I don't pay a cent in miner fees, it all depends on what software you are willing to use to store and spend your money.

You don't have to use core's wallet, no one in bitcoin can make you use software if you don't want to. I recommend looking at the benefits and drawbacks of running various wallets and then choosing based on that. The primary benefit of using the bitcoin core wallet is that it follows the rules of the bitcoin core node, and you can know for sure that it will always do so, unless you agree to change those rules. If you run Electrum's wallet, or Blockchain.info's wallet, or Bitpay's wallet, you don't have the same guarantee, because they could change the rules that their centralized node follows without telling you about the change they made. BTW can you link to somewhere that recommends Not storing your money on your bitcoin core wallet? I'm interested to hear the drawbacks.

Sounds likely to me, unless you want to make another CPFP transaction but use a super high fee. One that would get all three transactions confirmed quickly. I.e. about 3 times higher than usual. I don't know how important it is to you to get your transaction confirmed quickly, so forgive me if this sounds glib, but there is one lesson you can take away from this for the future: send your money to more than one public address. I personally recommend an HD wallet. Google that for more info.

If you print the paper wallet securely and don't store the private keys, I think it's fine to sell paper wallets to people.

You can't cancel the first transaction, it will almost certainly confirm before 3 days are gone, and likely the second transaction will confirm in the same block. You accidentally followed the standard procedure for a "child pays for parent" transaction, except you didn't set a high fee for the "child" transaction. Typically, in a CPFP transaction, they both confirm in the same block. If by some chance they don't confirm in the next 3 weeks, they'll both be returned to your wallet. To avoid this in the future, use a different public address as the input for your second transaction.

I believe that is called pruning, and it is already an option. (Well, in some node programs anyway. I run Bitcoin Core 15.1, and I've got pruning enabled, so I downloaded and processed every block from the beginning, but discarded almost all of that data except the most recent 550 megabytes. Pruning, yo.)


I don't think you can verify that they are valid without checking that they match the hash of the block right before them, and then you've got to make sure that one's valid by matching its hash with the block before it, and so forth, all the way back to the Genesis Block. Doing this results in downloading and processing every block -- which is what you have to do anyway.

* $1,210.42 Euro area
* $856.55 Japan
* $250.80 India
* $117.05 Russia
Since bitcoin is $128.04 billion, that would put it in fifth place, just ahead of Russia. But at the bottom of the list it says: "China is not part of the calculation and may be over a trillion dollars today."
So I guess that puts bitcoin in sixth place. Which is still incredible.

First, centralization is defined as a situation where a middleman has control, not just where a middleman exists. [source]( Routing partners on lightning could theoretically be in a hub and spoke topology and it still wouldn't be centralized because they have no control over your transactions. The worst thing a routing partner can do is decide not to forward transactions to a particular node, in which case you can simply route around them. And the onion routing of this network, btw, prevents routing partners from knowing the ultimate destination of funds, so a hub (if it ever exists) couldn't stop transactions from going through them to a node they don't like. Even if a hub banned a particular node, the banned node would only need one degree of separation from the hub, and it could receive payments through the hub again, because a hub would have no way of knowing who funds are ultimately being routed to. (And a banned node could also just route around the hub.)
That said, this network can remain not-hub-and-spokey by having lots of routing partners who are always online. Online merchants and exchanges will be part of the solution here, as well as nodes in countries on different schedules than us, and ordinary people with stable internet connections. These people will always be alternatives to central hubs, and we can connect to them to maintain an additional level of decentralization. But even if it was as hub-and-spokey as possible, lightning still wouldn't be centralized because centralization is not when a middleman exists, it's when a middleman has control -- and routing partners have no control over the destination of funds that are routed through them, especially when it's so easy for users to route around any node they don't like.
Regarding how ordinary users can receive lightning payments while offline, their best solution right now is to determine how much money they are likely to receive while offline; if it's a small amount, use a custodial lightning wallet while you're offline and withdraw from it whenever you get online. But if you are likely to receive large payments, get yourself a $5 raspberry pi and a stable internet connection, and spend a day setting up a node so that it's always online. If you're receiving a lot of money it's worth it to do that so you don't have to trust anyone. You can still use mobile wallets to connect to your full node, but your full node allows you to truslessly receive payments even when your phone is offline.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:11:29
Also, if you want to run a bitcoin node but don't want to run software created by Bitcoin Core, there are plenty of other implementations that still connect to the bitcoin network, but weren't created by Bitcoin Core. There's no way for Bitcoin Core to control the network when you can contribute to it without ever using their software.

Nope. Does it worry you that the Fed can do the same thing with the dollar?
I'll tell you what worries me, and I'm not trying to sound dramatic here: the dollar's value does not come from its inherent properties or from the consensus of its users. Its value comes from the decisions of its creators, who have a vested interest in printing more and more dollars (and, as a side effect, lowering its value in the process). I don't want any part of it because if any currency was announced today and had these properties, it would be instantly recognized as a scam. 
In contrast, the value of bitcoin comes from its users (yes, including wales) and its inherent properties, similar to "sound money" assets like gold or silver, but unlike those assets bitcoin is easy to secure and easy to transfer in large or small amounts. That's a monetary policy I can get behind, whether the value of each unit is great or small. That's why I'm all in.

A new bitcoin user very commonly starts by getting an account at a bitcoin exchange, to whom they give their personal info. They either leave their coins in a custodial wallet (probably the exchange itself), or move them to a non-custodial wallet. From the exchange's perspective, neither of these things breaks privacy assumptions, unless the coins start doing strange things in that non-custodial wallet. Later the user very commonly spends some of their coins, or they might just send them back to the exchange to sell them. That whole time, ordinarily and for most use cases, everything was very traceable, and I suspect that this is so common of a use case that I'd like to take some pains to make it more private.
So here's what I'm looking for. As soon as possible after a bitcoin leaves an exchange, I want the exchange's assumptions about it to no longer apply. In such a situation, Wasabi, good as it is, is not enough. Suppose the guy in my example puts his bitcoins in Wasabi. He's made a fine choice, for sure, but if the next time the exchange sees a transaction from that address it's just money coming right from that wallet to their coffers, the user's privacy hasn't really been improved. If instead he put it into a lightning channel, the exchange would no longer be able to make any safe assumptions. He might have sent it immediately to some other node, and they couldn't tell because the blockchain doesn't tell them anything about lightning transfers. If the next time the exchange sees a transaction from that address it comes to their coffers, they don't know if the user made 1000 payments and received just as many -- they have no idea what happened between then and now, and that's why lightning provides an even greater privacy boost than Zerolink, as good as Zerolink is. So I'd like to see them combined and standardized. Then the exchanges couldn't know a thing.

When the channel is set up the two parties (well, their wallets) agree on a commitment transaction in which money for the mining fee is set aside and does not show up in either party's balance. ~~The wallets are supposed to autoclose the channel if the mining fees get close to rising above the prearranged fee.~~ So I guess the answer to your question is, whoever funded the channel also prepaid the fee.
**EDIT :: I no longer think autoclosure is a thing wallets are supposed to do. See the comment thread below this comment for more info.

I don't think so. Lightning works between any two parties who want instant and nearly-free bitcoin transactions. One incentive to use it right now is because it allows you to have those features when you make payments to the companies who currently accept LN payments, such as Bitrefill, Torguard, and the 4000 merchants using OpenNode. You can make cheap instant payments right now with those companies -- and any merchant or customer who wants those features simply has to connect to the network as it exists now, even with few users.


You just need to give someone an electronic invoice. This process can be automated without your ongoing input. If you have a website, that website is online and can do it on its own. If you have a cash register computer, you can do it on there. If you just have a phone, you can just hit a "receive" button on there.


Same as above.


You could only lose money if the following conditions all happened: if your node stayed offline for the entire duration of one of your old transaction's locktimes, AND IF your counterparty thought his chances of defrauding you outweighed the risk of losing all the money he has in his payment channel with you, AND IF he thought your node was unlikely to come back online before the locktime runs out, AND IF he thinks you don't have a watchtower program protecting your money, AND IF you actually Don't use a watchtower program to protect your money when you're offline, THEN you could lose some money -- whatever amount was in your channel with him. LN has more safeguards to prevent you from losing money than most systems. BTW a watchtower service only needs to be about 5 lines of code, and can be run as a browser extension, a smartphone app, a distributed program, a cloud program on Amazon, or even a shared program on your friends's computers.


There are many solutions to  that I mentioned above.


The average person doesn't need to care about or understand them. Watchtowers are built into every lightning implementation. If you're the type of person who wants double extra security, then you clearly do care, and can put an extra watchtower program on Amazon's cloud service or wherever you like.


Why do you think there will be fees? Every LN implementation comes with an automated watchtower. Plus, additional watchtowers are very simple programs that you can run on any of your devices or any of your friends's devices if they agree. You can set it and forget it. I'm sure there will be some companies who offer to run a watchtower for you, but you don't need to use them because watchtower programs are simple enough to be implemented as a set-it-and-forget it app, extension, cloud program, or distributed program.


There can be no centralized hubs on the LN. Centralization is when a single person or group controls an activity. Routing partners can't control your payment activity, so there can be no centralization on the lightning network. No control = no centralization.


First, there can be no centralized hubs on the LN. Second, two new users can easily pay each other by setting up a payment channel with each other. There's a simple button -- "create a channel" -- with a simple instruction -- "scan the qr code of the person you want to connect to" -- and now you can pay that person directly over the LN, with no routing partner.


Funds on the LN are not locked up. You can remove them at any time. Moreover, you can spend them on the LN without removing them from the payment channel. So they are doubly not locked up. Also, what you describe as "locking up funds" here sounds identical to "sending someone money." If I thought you meant "no one is going to send their friend money because it locks their money up with their friend" then I would say that's a dumb argument, because sending someone money isn't locking up your money, it's getting rid of it. Moreover, even if "sending money" Was "locking up money" -- because you can no longer use it, I guess -- that Always happens when you send someone money. But I don't think that's what you mean, I think I'm just misunderstanding you.


You describe "locked up funds" as the cause of this alleged monthly fee. But funds on the LN are not locked up. The cause being removed, the effect is lifted: there is no reason for there to be a monthly fee for using a routing partner. Your routing partners can collect enough money through the standard routing fee. Also, if you think a particular routing partner is too big for your comfort level, just don't connect to him. Connecting to a specific routing partner is never mandatory.


If you mean "your routing partner could withdraw his money from his half of the channel so that your previous payments can't go through," no, that can't happen, for several reasons. First, the locktime prevents people from removing money from a channel quickly unless they have the consent of their counterparty. Second, if someone tries to remove their money from your channel without your consent, using the slower, lock-time method, your node (and/or any watchtower you choose) has a signed transaction from your routing partner sending you the money he has committed to you, which you can broadcast at any time. Since your counterparty tried to remove his money without your consent, he was forced to use the locktime method, which prevents his transaction from being mined until your node (and/or a watchtower) has had time to broadcast the latest transaction and get you your money (plus a possible fraud-blocker reward which takes all the money the defrauder had in the channel with you).


Routing partners are not subject to KYC requirements. Lightning nodes route data packets just like tcp/ip gateways and do not transmit any money. You do not need a KYC license to transmit data packets -- only to transmit money, which lightning nodes don't do. The blockchain is the only payment processor involved in the lightning network, and, just like with a normal bitcoin node, you don't need a kyc license to use the blockchain. Lightning nodes don't process payments, they just transmit data from one user to another so that each user can broadcast a blockchain transaction on their own whenever they want -- and users do not need a kyc license to do that.


First, there is no way to predict that, because we can't know how large payment channels will get. Second, if you can't make a large payment, break it up into small payments. Third, if you still can't use the LN for a large payment, pay using the blockchain. If for any reason people are unable to make large payments on the LN, that will be a clear sign that the LN is only good for small payments. But we can't know that will happen in the future from our current vantage point in the present.


This comment confuses me. I'm sure you don't mean the values transmitted are larger. Do you mean the settlement transactions have a larger number of bytes than a normal transaction? Because I don't think the bytesize difference is substantial. Can you provide more details?


They only need to keep track of that information if they want to gain a fraud-blocker reward in the event that their counterparty tries something fraudulent. If you're just interested in not losing coins, you just need to have a copy of the latest transaction you've signed -- and you might even have backups on one or more watchtower programs. If your node (or a watchtower program) sees a transaction enter the mempool from your payment channel which differs from the latest signed transaction, it has plenty of time to broadcast the latest one before the old one's locktime clears and stop the old one from getting mined. Old channel states can simply be discarded unless you're interested in the possible fraud-blocker reward. All you actually *need* is your latest signed transaction, or a backup copy, such as on one or more watchtower programs.

Chrome OS is a custom linux distro which until recently took a "walled garden" approach by default, which made it difficult to install linux software. But Google recently added an option in settings to make linux software installation simpler. Enabling this feature essentially grants you access to a full terminal, which is good because before, you could only access a very limited terminal unless you put your device in developer mode, which removes some of its security protections. (The new setting gives you a full terminal but keeps the security settings in place.) So I enabled the new setting and then followed the instructions on bitcoin.org for installing bitcoin core on any linux distro. Now that Chrome OS's "walls" are easily removable, it's much easier to run Bitcoin Core. (And basically any other linux software too.)

Pretty high, but the more you buy the better rate you get. I think the most expensive one I ever saw started with an 18% rate, which went lower as the amount of coin you purchased rose. When I bought from one in 2017 I think I got a 10% rate, which I think was decent relative to other BTMs. Essentially you're paying out the nose to get your bitcoins immediately. I was grateful to finally get approved at an exchange after that. A 2% rate was like a miracle. And the Square Cash app really took it up a notch, because it doesn't have a waiting period for withdrawing like Coinbase does.

Samourai connects to a central server by default, but you can change that in settings and set it to connect to any node you want, including one of your own, if you have one.
Below I've written some basic information about thin clients versus SPV nodes. The tldr is: thin clients are fast but centralized, SPV nodes are slow but decentralized. Both have popular implementations.
There are two types of mobile wallets: thin clients and SPV nodes. Thin clients contain code that instructs them to connect to a particular node on the bitcoin network, usually a node owned by the company who made the wallet, and if they want any information about the blockchain they ask that node. The advantage of this is that thin clients are very fast, almost instant. They don't sync directly with the blockchain to get their information (which would be slow, because blockchains are slow and they store hundreds of gigabytes of data). Instead, the node that they connect to handles all the downloading and processing for them on powerful servers, and the thin client just gets information from that node. The disadvantage of thin clients is that they trust the node operator to give them correct information. The wallet maker can even control what blockchain their users are connected to. Popular thin client wallets are Mycelium, Eclair, and Copay. (And back when the Segwit2x debacle was happening, Copay tried to "upgrade" its users by putting them all on the Segwit2x network without asking their permission. Luckily, that blockchain got cancelled a few days before it went live, so nothing ever came of it. But it shows the danger of thin client wallets -- if you don't pay attention and move your funds ahead of time, you could be "upgraded" off the bitcoin network by the wallet maker.)
SPV nodes connect directly to the bitcoin blockchain and download all their information from there. But they don't download the whole blockchain. They use filters to ignore all the data on the blockchain except data about transactions that are sent to or from their user. The advantage of SPV nodes is that they don't have to worry about a particular node being dishonest -- they don't need any particular node because they process their information directly from the blockchain, but just ignore the data that they don't need. The disadvantage of SPV nodes is that they are slower than thin clients. They don't have to process the whole blockchain like a full node does, but they do have to watch for blocks containing transactions to or from their wallet, download those blocks, and process them. Since they sync with the blockchain directly, and blockchains are slow, SPV nodes are slow too. Initial sync time can take up to 15 minutes or more (it depends on your phone's processor) and whenever you open the wallet they have to sync for maybe 30 seconds or so to get up to date with the latest data. Popular SPV nodes include Greenaddress, Greenbits, and Bitcoin Lightning Wallet.

Your keypair isn't invalidated, it just no longer has a ticket registered to it. The tickets are digital tokens, like itty bitty bitcoins, and one is sent by the issuer to your wallet address. When you sell the ticket you transfer it to another person's wallet address. Your keypair isn't invalid, it just doesn't have a ticket anymore because you sent it to someone else when you sold it.


Assuming it's a public blockchain the buyer can generate his own keypair. (Well, his smartphone would probably create it for him when he downloads an app.) What he can't do is issue his own ticket -- he's either got to get one from the issuer or from someone else who has one.

Wasabi is great for breaking the assumptions of blockchain analysts. But as things stand right now, bitcoin services can profitably *choose to exclude* private transactions that use this method, or they can be *forced* to. This is because it is easy to tell the difference between a transaction that breaks your assumptions and a transaction that doesn't. To my mind, bitcoin will only be fully fungible when most transactions do not allow an analyst to make any assumptions that can help identify the user. In particular, an input should not reliably come from an address which can be reliably linked to a user. Lightning already works this way; your address is not revealed when you make a payment, and there are no inputs. But moving funds *into* a lightning channel address is still typically done in a traceable way. In my opinion, we should standardize things so that most transactions happen over lightning, and enough of the rest use Zerolink and/or Tumblebit. Then I'll be happy.

I agree with basically all of that. I think we might be measuring transactions per second differently. If you assume around 2000 transactions per block, then about 2000 transactions confirm every ten minutes. 10 minutes is 600 seconds. 2000 transactions per 600 seconds is equivalent to 3.33 transactions per second. What segwit did was increase the numerator -- more transactions can fit in a block now, so instead of dividing ~2000 by 600 we're now dividing, say, ~2500 by 600 -- which results in a higher rate of transactions per second, i.e. "slightly faster confirmations." But there is a simpler way to measure transactions per second, which is this: if you pay a sufficient fee, you'll almost certainly get into the next block, which is on average 10 minutes away. Every time. If you measure it that way, segwit didn't affect transaction speeds at all, and neither will anything short of a hard fork that speeds up the block interval. I think you are measuring the second, simpler way and I am measuring the first, more complicated way.

If you want to be one, it's free and helps secure the network; all you have to do is download and run the Bitcoin Core node software from bitcoin.org. All other wallets, including mobile wallets, connect to the nodes of node operators in order to download information from the blockchain.

No, that's [bitcoin clashic]( For those that get confused by that site, it's a demonstration of how ridiculous the BCH community is. BCH has hard forked several times since it was first introduced; their first hard fork was to remove their "emergency difficulty adjustment" protocol, which had backfired by breaking the game theoretic underpinnings that keep miners mining. During that hard fork, a few bitcoin supporters kept the original, broken BCH client running, which is now called Bitcoin Clashic. Bitcoin Clashic is literally what it says on the website: "The [chain which] launched on August 1st, 2017 and [which] is still alive." The modern BCH is a hard fork off of the Bitcoin Clashic chain, which originally hard forked off of Bitcoin on August 1st, 2017 under the name Bitcoin Cash.

This value is commonly stated but it doesn't go uncriticized. One of the criticisms is that the number 6 (or "between 5 and 7") doesn't count batch transactions fairly. As [outputs.today]( rightly points out, "Outputs per day is a better indicator...than transactions per day. Since one transaction can include multiple outputs, the number of total outputs is more important than the number of transactions themselves."
A typical "5-to-7 transactions per second" block often has one or more batch transactions in it with hundreds or even thousands of outputs. Should we really count a batch transaction as only one of the transactions in the block, when up to a few thousand people received a payment in that "one" transaction? Personally, I think we should count each output in a batch as a transaction. And consider this: if we get Schnorr, users and companies will be increasingly incentivized to use batching services to save massively on fees. Segwit gives us up to 8000 transactions per block. If a good number of those end up being batch transactions, with thousands of transactions in them each, then the "5-to-7 transactions per second" estimate is underestimated by at least one order of magnitude.
I don't think we can support 7 billion users yet, but I think if we get Schnorr, and create some decent batching services (a decentralized one that uses fewer inputs than Coinjoin would be nice), and combine those with lightning, we can support up to 1 billion users without a blocksize increase.

This doesn't really contradict what you wrote, but it seems to me that the libertarian party in America has become more and more aligned with the republican party during the last few elections. Their best known candidates run as republicans almost as often as they run as libertarians, and quite often they get elected as republicans. Ron Paul is a good example, but so is the fact that the Libertarian candidate for senator in Montana just recently dropped out of the race and endorsed the republican, ostensibly because he is more interested in defeating the democrat than in getting elected himself. It seems similar to the way the green party and the American socialist movement have more closely aligned themselves with the democrat party over the same time period (with Bernie Sanders being the best known political example).
I guess it helps build the impression that the libertarian party is part of the "right wing" of American politics.

I think so. LND and C-Lightning both have settings that seem relevant to this; in LND one of the relevant parameters is called fee_per_kw, and in C-Lightning it's called feerate_per_kw. I'm not sure what Eclair calls this paramater but I see in [this issue tracker]( that some bugs were found back in May relating to force-closing a channel with insufficient fees, and potential solutions were being discussed. I imagine the bugs have been fixed now and autoclosure works. A thread from LND about a similar issue can be seen here: 
**EDIT :: I was just checking the bolt specifications, and autoclosure appears to currently be something optional. "A node[,] if the resulting fee rate is too low[,] MAY fail the channel." [source](

In the immortal words of Sebastian (��), "Nonsense. It don't take all that." Copy-paste the text of your file into any sha256 tool online. (Just Google sha256 tool.) Then use coinb.in wallet's op_return function to write the resulting hash to the blockchain. (YouTube has some tutorials for this; search for op_return coinb.in.) Now the fingerprint of your file is on the blockchain at a specific time and you can prove that at that time you owned the file that generated that blueprint by simply generating the hash again and proving ownership of the private key to the address that sent the hash to the blockchain.

Segwit was an upgrade to the bitcoin network. When it went through in August 2017, it allowed users to do a new type of transaction (if they want to) which moves a significant amount of transaction data from the middle of their transaction to the end of their transaction, and gives that data a discount when you're paying transaction fees. Segwit transactions are optional, but they do save you money. Smartphone wallets which support Segwit include Greenbits, Greenaddress, and Samourai.
Although I will point out: since Segwit went through, transaction fees have dropped significantly (partly due to this upgrade), and it is currently quite easy to send a transaction with a fee of one penny even without using Segwit addresses.

No, the whole blockchain is stored by default when you run the Bitcoin Core software. Unless you change it, you store the whole blockchain.




It needs at least one person to store it. The more people there are storing the blockchain, the more secure the network is. But technically it can still operate a long as one person has a copy and other wallets can access that copy to get the information they need.

I agree with 2-4, but re:  segwit allowed for considerably bigger blocks, and bigger blocks onchain arguably allows for faster transactions. Segwit is used in a minority of payments, so far, so it's "bigger blocks" effect is somewhat limited, but I think you could make a successful argument that segwit allows for slightly bigger blocks and bigger blocks allow for faster transactions, therefore segwit allows for slightly faster transactions.

Part of the reason why there is no backlog now is because we chewed through it quicker than we would have if no one had been using segwit. And part of the reason we've been able to maintain a nil backlog is because even more people are using segwit now. So I think it's fair to say that segwit has led to faster confirmations -- but batching by exchanges was far more of an immediate cause imo. Segwit's impact is still quite limited because only 30% of transactions are using it, and even at maximum usage it will likely only slightly double our onchain capacity. For onchain scaling, batching was more important in the short term -- says me.

A blockchain is not superior to a standard database for this purpose. Centralization is not a concern, because the store has no incentive to "cheat" the Seeker by giving him wrong information, unless they want to prank him by making him show up when the product is not really ready, which would be a silly concern as they already have an incentive not to do that: it's bad business. The product information doesn't need to be immutable, there's no reason to store forever that the Seeker's product is ready. Employees still have to enter digital information about the status of a product into a computer whether they do that on the blockchain or on a standard database. Using a blockchain to update the Seeker has no advantages over a standard database for this purpose.

If the NYA chain immediately has fewer transactions than the BTC chain, then NYA will go the way of BCH (which is not all that bad, since BCH is the fourth biggest digital currency).

You select what fees to use when you set up a channel with the counterparty. You or the counterparty can only modify it if you both consent.
Also, game theory says that miners will try to mine the bird in the hand rather than *hope* they get the bigger bird in the bush later. A miner who mines your up-to-date transaction can beat out any of the ones who are waiting for the higher value one to become eligible, and since they all know that the most up to date one could be mined at any time, taking away the timelocked one, they'll all want to get the drop on everyone else. Plus if each miner considers waiting, he knows there's no guarantee that he'll be there one to get it in his block even if everyone else waits too. They've all get a better shot of getting the currently available one -- so that's what they'll almost all try to do.

It reminds me of how Visa claims to process up to 40k transactions per second, but those are unfinalized transactions and don't actually move to the recipient's account for several days. But when people talk about bitcoin they talk about the transactions per block instead of per "several days." Bitcoin's blockchain can already process a bit over 2k transactions per block, with over 450 blocks every few days. And that's not including the transactions per second that occur on the private 2nd layer ledgers of Coinbase, Bitstamp, et. al., who process thousands of additional bitcoin transactions every day without touching the blockchain.

Whatever attackers are doing to the chain of channels doesn't affect you. Your money only comes from your payment channel with your counterparty, and you have the latest transaction guaranteeing you that money. Outside attackers can't do anything to that channel. Moreover, your counterparty can't do a locktime attack for free -- doing a locktime attack requires him to broadcast the latest transaction (or an old, now-fraudulent transaction) and close the channel. There is a mining fee for that, plus his money goes into the locktime too, and he now has to make another onchain transaction if he wants to open a new channel to replace the one he closed. And if he happens to broadcast a fraudulent transaction, there is an additional cost: he could lose all the money he has in the payment channel if you or a watchtower catches him. These are all costs to himself, and the only thing he gets from it is that all your money gets returned to you when the locktime runs out -- plus a possible fraud-blocker reward if he didn't broadcast the latest transaction you agreed to.


Good point. I think we should put in an easy fix button right under the "no route available" dialog box: "Would you like to create a channel directly to the payee? It will cost X.XX bitcoins." Do you think that would solve the problem? You could also give them the option to do a blockchain payment: "You can also pay him using the blockchain. A blockchain payment will cost X.XX bitcoins."


This appears to be the same as "Lightning will not be able to route large payments," and has the same solutions. Unless I'm misunderstanding you, which is of course quite possible. If I'm misunderstanding you, would you please clarify? Thanks!


I agree that putting more money into lightning takes at least one onchain transaction. I recommend against refilling a channel, since that reuses a blockchain address. This option is deliberately excluded from the user interface of existing LN implementations, and therefore requires people to do a custom tx using a different wallet. Instead of going through all that, I recommend that people should just hit the "create a new channel" button. It costs the same amount of money, doesn't require a custom transaction, and doesn't reuse an address.


Creating a new channel shouldn't happen very often even over the course of your lifetime. If people typically receive their bitcoins over the LN then they shouldn't need to create many channels for that, and they should be able to send money to anyone on the network even if they only have a few channels. Moreover, the times when they have to close a channel and then open a new one should be very rare. This is because closing a channel has too many negatives and almost no positives. Almost the only thing it does is move your money to yet another address under your control (which lightning channels already are) and takes away the advanced features of a lightning channel such as increased speed, increased cheapness, and increased privacy. I don't expect many people to want to close their channels and open new ones.


We don't have a 1mb blocksize limit anymore. The blocksize limit is almost 4 mb and we expect the average size of blocks to be above 2 mb. Also, when more improvements are ready we plan to increase the blocksize. This increase, combined with the expectation of very infrequent opening of new channels, should solve this problem.




I haven't given enough thought to the amount of transaction fees that would be required to maintain the security provided by having many powerful miners, and thus I cannot answer this problem. I hope someone else has done the math better than me. I will mention that I expect there to be more onchain transactions than 170 million, due to some people preferring onchain transactions and the need to occasionally open and close lightning channels. But I haven't done any math to estimate how many transactions that could create. Thank you for sharing your concerns, I hope this response is helpful.

Step one: search Google for the current amount in bitcoin that equals the dollar amount you want to receive. E.g. "$10 USD to BTC"
Step two: open any wallet software, such as Mycelium or Arcbit or Greenaddress, and click the "receive" tab.
Step three: have your client send the btc amount from Step 1 to the receiving address in Step 2.

Apparently it's a computer program that you can download whether or not you have any bitcoins. You can then connect one or more bitcoin or altcoin addresses to this app and have it know your identity. The developers don't technically need to have bitcoins to make this app work, because you could connect an empty address to your identity, but if they're developing apps for bitcoin they probably do own some.
After reading a bit more I now think the above paragraph is incorrect. What I think Microsoft is doing now is this: they intend to let you take your digital identity information and use their program to put it on the blockchains of bitcoin and some altcoins. They will likely use the op_return function to do this, since it allows you to put non-transactional info on bitcoin's blockchain, but they might also use multi-output transactions to do this, where each output contains a hash of a portion of your digital identity info. If this is indeed what they plan to do, then each download of this software would need to have access to some bitcoins or altcoins in order to put your info on the blockchain in the form of op_return functions or in the form of multi-output transactions.
Presumably, this would mean the app developers also need some bitcoins or altcoins, at least to test the process and make sure it works. Also, if this is the route they go, all the users of this software will need to spend bitcoins or altcoins, at least a small amount, in order to put their identity info on one or more blockchains. If the amounts required are small enough, perhaps they will be included in the cost of the software, and it would all be done on the backend where you never actually see the tokens unless you go looking for them. Otherwise, you'll likely have to own some bitcoins or altcoins yourself in order to make the program work.

Two thoughts: one, merchants already wait 1-3 days for debit card transactions to go from "pending" to "confirmed," and yet they let you pump your gas anyway. If someone started cancelling such transactions every time, they would stop selling that person gas, and it is reasonable to suspect that they would do the same with bitcoin: let them pump their gas, and if they start doing double-spends every time, stop selling them gas.
Second, merchants can make transactions go faster by sending the unconfirmed funds to a new address. If they pay a high fee, it will go through in the next block. Include that fee in your product's listed btc price, and just do it with every low-fee transaction for added security and speed.

He's saying he used to buy bitcoins when they were $1 apiece, which I think was in 2010 or 2011. He wants to know if he can track down where they were stored so he can see if he still has some left over.
The main exchange at the time, I think, was Mt. Gox? Or maybe they were all transacted via the core client at the time? Mt. Gox went bankrupt though, and so far I don't think anyone has received their coins back from them... And if you stored them on the Core client instead of at Mt. Gox, you'd need the old hard drive you used (and the software would need to still be on there, even if only in the system ram).
BitInstant also sold them at that time... And they went bankrupt too.

First, how on earth would you go about tracking USD on a blockchain? Everytime I hand you one, would someone come along and note down the number thingy, and erase it from my side of the ledger while adding it to yours? And tell you not to use the dollar I gave you until sometime verifies the exchange by mining it? USD is not tracked on a blockchain.
Second, one big difference between fiat value and bitcoin value is this: each bitcoin costs thousands of dollars to produce, and miners are unlikely to sell them for less than it costed them to produce. Fiat dollars cost almost nothing to produce, and the government can print them at will and literally give them away to a lucky few in the form of bailouts.

It would make a block that is valid according to its own, old rules but which newer nodes think is invalid. So its block will only propagate among a minority of nodes -- specifically old nodes. Meanwhile, the majority of nodes will make a new block faster than the minority chain of old nodes. And, since old nodes view the longest chain as correct no matter what, they will then switch to the new chain and "forget" the invalid block.

I like that if you search for a node it will tell you when its last activity was. That will help when debugging route failures -- you can get info about whether one of the nodes in your route was offline by checking to see when its last activity was. If it was a while ago, maybe it's offline, so find a route that doesn't use that node. And if its last activity was just a few minutes ago, it's probably still online, so the problem lies elsewhere -- useful information either way. Thank you!

For the last year I've been using a bitcoin backed card for possibly around 33% of my transactions. This is a semi-centralized system -- I send bitcoins to a company who then sends USDs to my card. I mostly like this system and don't really mind paying USDs at the time of purchase. This system allows me to keep my money in btc until the time of purchase, at which time I'm getting rid of it anyway, so what do I care if it's briefly in the form of USDs?
Anyway I use this method a lot, but I am aware of its problems. First, there are a few places that don't accept my debit card because it's a prepaid card. When I send the btcs, the company I use sends the USDs to the card, which is a prepay model. So that occasionally stinks. But also, in the back of my mind I know that Visa is still involved in processing this payment, and thus each merchant I go to is paying about 6 cents per transaction in fees, and those costs are passed on to me in the form of higher prices. 6 cents per transaction over the course of a month adds up. I'd much rather pay each merchant in bitcoins directly, so that this Visa fee thingy wouldn't be such a problem.
Despite these problems I am on the whole pretty happy with my bitcoin debit card. I thought you'd like to know that such payment cards already exist and work well. Cheers!
P.S. I buy coffees with this bitcoin backed debit card. I bought one today, actually. You can buy coffees with bitcoins -- I do it, and I know that others do too.

Greenaddress gives you the twelve words. Your private key is those words, hashed. You can type them into almost any wallet software to move your funds without sweeping. If your previous wallet uses the twelve word system, you can import those words into Greenaddress without spending any money, and your bitcoins will be available in the new software.
Greenaddress also supports Segwit address, which is very significant because it reduces fees enormously. You pay 4 times fewer satoshis if you use Segwit addresses to store your money and to spend from.

There's a locktime to prevent you from closing a channel quickly unless you have your counterparty's consent. Since Bob won't consent to having his money stolen, you'll have to close the channel slowly, using the locktime method. During this locktime your money is still in a channel with Bob, and thus he has plenty of time to receive his money by broadcasting the transaction info he received from you when you agreed to route a transaction from Alice to Bob.

The library of babel is an imaginary library where a bunch of librarians printed a bunch of books, each one 410 pages, with every possible combination of letters and numbers that would fit in the page limit. Then the librarians went through the whole lot trying to organize the coherent ones, and separate them from the incoherent ones, so that they could have a complete collection of all possible books.
This imaginary library isn't similar to the blockchain at all. The blockchain is a chronological list of payments. The library of babel is a collection of every possible book. Those two concepts share almost nothing in common, other than, both involve storing data somewhere. The type of data is different, and the amount of data is vastly different. It's very silly to equate the two.
Putting the library of babel on bitcoin's blockchain would take an enormous amount of custom transactions. If you tried to broadcast all the transactions at once you would fail, because the internet doesn't have enough bandwidth to share that amount of information. If you broadcasted these custom transactions slow enough for the internet to handle, but still faster than miners can mine them, you would soon create a storage crisis where nodes would gradually stop storing and processing the complete mempool, because it's too much for their cpus to process and too large for their storage drives to store. This would break the network if no one did anything about it, but it would be pretty easy to just block all babel-like transactions and ban you. You could avoid getting everyone mad at you by broadcasting these custom transactions slowly enough that miners could mine them without bricking everyone's mempool -- but you would run out of money before you could broadcast all the transactions.

Your node doesn't receive information about other people's nodes other than how much money is in them. It doesn't know which side of the channel has more. If a channel can't route a payment, it can't forward the payment information to the next node, and returns as a failure to route. Your node checks all available routes, and if none returns as valid, then it doesn't route at all. By this method, your node doesn't need to find out any information about the current state of other people's channels, and in fact it does not receive that information. The gentleman is wrong.

Fees can get significantly lower than 1 satoshi per byte. Lightning transactions are typically under 5 satoshis *total.* An on-chain transaction, even at 1 satoshi per byte, is on average still about 300 satoshis total, because each transaction is many bytes. Lightning fees work differently because they are not counted per byte. So 1 satoshi means 1 satoshi total in terms of lightning fees, whereas in an onchain transaction, 1 satoshi per byte translates to (on average) 300 satoshis total -- which is hundreds of times more expensive than an average lightning transaction.

It depends on what kind of wallet you use. Most mobile wallets don't download any information from the blockchain except the info they need, so they never need to increase their storage. For example, server-trusting wallets only get info about the transactions that have been sent to or from their wallet. They ignore all the other data on the blockchain. So their storage requirement doesn't grow when the blockchain grows, because they're ignoring almost everything that's on there.
Node operators are the ones who need to increase their storage as the blockchain grows. However, the growth of the blockchain cannot balloon out of control. The maximum amount of transaction data that can be added to the blockchain per block is limited by the node software that the network operators run. That limit only grows when there is consensus on the network to increase it. Currently, the practical limit is about 2.5 megabytes every 10 minutes, or about 1.3 terabytes per year. This is a number that most node operators think they can easily cope with. It can't get out of control because the node operators are in control and need consensus amongst themselves to increase it. If a need for more transactions arises, node operators may increase the storage requirements, but it won't happen without consensus among them on a storage requirement that the vast majority of them can manage, based on the price of hard drives and other data storage mechanisms. In short, they only need to purchase more storage as agreed upon amongst themselves.


Miners don't only mine new bitcoins. Every transaction that gets mined on the blockchain also includes a mining fee, and miners mine those transactions to collect the fees. When the max supply of bitcoins is reached, there will be no new bitcoins, but there will still be transactions that pay mining fees. Miners will continue to mine those transactions just like they do now. Right now, they mine new bitcoins and they mine transactions that send them fees. When there are no new bitcoins, they will only mine transactions that send them fees.

One big improvement will be user friendly lightning wallets. If you use a lightning wallet, other people cannot know who you've paid or how much you've paid them. And even if they find out which lightning channel is yours, and how much money is in it, they can't know how much of that money is yours -- you might have sent it to someone else over the network, and they would have no idea. Third parties can only find out how much money is in a lightning channel, but not its distribution, and they also can't find out how many transactions have been made from that channel, or in what amounts, or who received those payments. Lightning wallets are a massive improvement in bitcoin privacy, and I can't wait til we see some user friendly ones.

A block is a bundle of transactions that are confirmed together all at once. Whenever a transaction is confirmed for the first time, it is added to the blockchain as part of the latest "block" of transactions. Miners are people who use their computers to collect unconfirmed transactions into blocks and confirm them. They can confirm several thousand new transactions per block, but it's a limited number, and there are usually more people wanting their transactions to be confirmed than they can handle. So they have to pick which ones to confirm and let the rest wait. They generally choose to confirm only those transactions which pay the highest amount in fees, because miners collect those fees as profit. Low-fee transactions can just wait to be confirmed until a time when all the large-fee transactions have gone through. That way, even low-fee transactions will get confirmed eventually.
I tell you all that to tell you this: some miners have set their computers to Never confirm low-fee transactions. When there are a bunch of them and very few high-fee transactions, the "blocks" they produce are small, because they only contain a few hundred transactions -- the ones from people who were willing to pay high fees even though they didn't need to. (People do this for a variety of reasons, though it's often because they want to be Very sure their transaction is confirmed in the next block.) This is every miner's right because no one can force them to confirm a transaction if they don't want to, or if don't profit enough from it. The conference for "little people" is: your low-fee transactions have to wait for a friendly miner before they get confirmed. Which isn't fun, but hey, it's a free market.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:30:20
1/ Bitcoin does have low fees. Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain are confirming today for 2 satoshis per byte. Bitcoin transactions on the lightning network are confirming for 1 or 2 satoshis *total.* Bitcoin transactions are therefore cheaper than Bcash transactions.
2/ Bitcoin does have a reliable network. The percentage of network uptime in its existence so far outpaces any other network I'm aware of. On bcash, even though it has only existed for a short time, there have been several weeks when blocks were so seldom found that "emergency difficulty adjustments" had to happen frequently -- sometimes every few days -- to make the network start working again. Bitcoin's network reliability is therefore higher than bcash's.
3/ Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. BTW I'm noticing that the first problem the guy mentions is "high fees," the second is "directly related to the high fee situation," and the third is "Since transaction fees on BTC have skyrocketed." Are all 3 of these really just one thing? It is important to remind people that onchain fees are about 2 satoshis per byte right now, and lightning fees are about 2 satoshis *total.* BTW bcash is hardly used by any vendors, far fewer than the number who accept bitcoin. Bitcoin has more merchants accepting it as electronic cash than bcash does.
4/ Bitcoin does scale up onchain. We increased the blocksize recently with the segwit upgrade and we plan to do it again when more improvements are ready to go in at the same time, using the "big bang" upgrade model. Also, bitcoin was originally intended to Also scale off-chain. Satoshi's original code allowed for payment channels to be created for the purpose of high frequency payments. Bitcoin scales using the original methods introduced by Satoshi. It does this better than bcash, which relies upon bigger and bigger blocks which increase centralization and destroy transaction security.
5/ Bitcoin does allow instant transactions, via the lightning network. The article says that 0-conf transactions are the way to go, but Satoshi said "we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation." [source]( Moreover, the article argues that replace-by-fee is a bad thing, but bcash still allows replace-by-fee. In fact, bcash cannot get rid of replace-by-fee unless they change the gossip protocol that allows nodes to share the mempool. The ability to do replace-by-fee transactions is a side-effect of the gossip protocol used by both bitcoin and bcash. Bitcoin accepts instant transactions better than bcash because it does so securely through the lightning network, while bcash does it unsecurely, through 0-confirm transactions which can be replaced (and the funds taken).
6/ Bitcoin is gaining more merchants than bcash is. Just do a google search for "now accepts bitcoin" versus "now accepts bitcoin cash." There are many thousands of more results for the former.
7/ This one is about high fees again: "Bitcoin Was Meant to Bank the Unbanked...until Bitcoin’s high fees made that impossible." I'm starting to wonder if the author actually has 12 reasons or if he has 4 reasons and then just keeps saying "high fees, high fees, high fees" for the other 8. It is important to remind people that onchain fees are about 2 satoshis per byte right now, and lightning fees are about 2 satoshis *total.* Anyway, bitcoin still banks the unbanked. All you need to do to start receiving payments is come up with a random number of sufficient length (i.e. a valid private key). Moreover, the lightning network can allow you to receive these payments without paying high fees. Bitcoin can bank the unbanked better than bcash can, and with lower fees.
8/ Bitcoin development is not centralized. It has more independent developers than bcash does and its organized developers are more diversified than bcash's are into more organizations.
9/ Bitcoin allows combining and splitting value as well. BTW this one is yet another complaint about high fees: "high Bitcoin fees make combining unspent outputs very expensive." It is important to remind people that onchain fees are about 2 satoshis per byte right now, and lightning fees are about 2 satoshis *total.*
10/ Bitcoin is censorship resistant. BTW this one is yet another complaint about high fees. He says bitcoin is censorship resistant "[only if you] can afford to pay the high fees." It is important to remind people that onchain fees are about 2 satoshis per byte right now, and lightning fees are about 2 satoshis *total.* The article argues that bitcoin is no longer censorship resistant because LN routing partners have the option of not routing your transactions.  There's a lot wrong with that. For one thing, even if LN payments were censorable, which they aren't, LN transactions are optional -- you can always just do a blockchain payment. But a worse problem with the article's statement is this: miners in bcash (and in bitcoin too) also have the option of not mining your transactions. That doesn't make it censorable -- if a routing partner (or a miner) won't route (or mine) your transaction, just find one who will, or open a direct payment channel yourself. Bitcoin does censorship resistance better than bcash because it is less centralized. BTW in this paragraph the author calls bcash "the original blockchain-based Bitcoin system." It isn't. The bcash blockchain first started to exist in August of 2017 and began by removing features of bitcoin that had existed for years (like the explicit RBF option). If you start up Bitcoin 0.1, the original code released by Satoshi, it will start up and connect to the bitcoin network with no problem. It will verify all transactions and confirm all blocks. It will not connect to bcash, though, because bcash uses a different blockchain on a different network. The original bitcoin client sees bcash transactions as invalid because they are on the wrong blockchain. So much for bcash being "the original blockchain-based Bitcoin system."
11/ Bitcoin keeps the signatures. Even segwit transactions keep the signatures. The diagram the author provides is wrong because it says segwit signatures are "outside the chain," and they aren't. They are in the chain. They're just put at the end of the chain instead of in the middle. Moreover, bitcoin has always allowed transactions to be sent with the witness data segregated from the rest of the data, or even removed. This is why segwit is a soft-fork, not a hard-fork -- because it was backward-compatible with the existing software. BTW the author says "miners no longer even need to download the signatures...since they are now separate from the transactions." This is incorrect. If miners relay a block without signatures, the network will reject them as invalid blocks.
12/ Bitcoin allows smart contracts. The lightning network uses smart contracts. The author says bcash is better because it will reintroduce some op-codes that were long ago removed from bitcoin and moved over to ethereum -- but bitcoin can do smart contracts without those op-codes and all they do is make it easier to write bloated contracts. Bitcoin's smart contracts are slimmer than ethereum's, and if all bcash plans to do on this note is reintroduce those op-codes, it won't be an improvement.

On a low-end Windows computer, your computer is using more money in electricity costs than you'll receive back from the nicehash network. This is because it takes a long time for a low-end microchip to solve the complex equations it takes to mine for bitcoins, and every second costs more electricity costs.
Nicehash is a network that has to have reliable and fast computers working on these complex mathematics problems. If they use your computer, they know that it costs money to request solution-data from your computer (data costs and electricity costs), and your low-end computer will produce such tiny amounts of solution-data that including it in their network would cost them (and you) more money than it would generate. So they told you it's not profitable and that was that. To fix this you'd need to get faster, more expensive, higher end microchips. Sorry, but mining for bitcoins profitably, as of right now, requires advanced, specialized microchips designed just for solving cryptography problems.

I doubt they will want to because blockchains are expensive to run as an institution and, when an institution runs a blockchain on their own servers, it will always be cheaper to just move everything to a centralized database -- which is what they use now. Blockchains only become cost effective when you "outsource" the job of running nodes to volunteers, and I question whether banks will think that's a good idea. Whoever controls the nodes controls the network. Banks want to control the network because it's a financial network. So they'll want to control the nodes. And then we're back to square one: if they run all the nodes, it's super expensive, and since all the nodes have the same data on them, they'll be like, "Um, why don't we just consolidate, and have one database?" And then it's not a decentralized network anymore. It's what we have now.

Here's how I imagine the censorship will look: "Sorry, but we couldn't process your transaction because it is associated with an anonymous service that isn't registered with such and such. If you think you've received this message in error, please contact us here and tell us blah and blah."
If we don't get our privacy solutions right, the so-called "legitimate" services can be pressured to register at some centralized certifier, and then share with one another what batching addresses they use so that the certifier can tell all their colluders it's okay if a transaction comes through one of the addresses they know about. Then, all the legal crypto companies can profitably block transactions that came through unregistered batching addresses. To prevent this scenario, I think we need to make it so that standard bitcoin transactions do not reveal what address they come from. Zerolink certainly helps, and it's one way of getting where we need to be. I'm just saying we're not out of the woods yet. We've hit a home run but the game's not over until most bitcoin transactions are the kind where you can't tell what address sent the payment.

Typically the price is less than 5 satoshis total. The price is calculated based on routing fees, which are what the LN uses instead of mining fees. On the LN you typically send your transaction information to its destination via a route, hopping from one routing partner to another. Each routing partner passes along your transaction info to the next routing partner until it reaches the destination. Each routing partner may charge a routing fee, and the fee is typically 1 satoshi or less. If you do 5 hops, that's about 5 satoshis total to get your transaction info to its destination.

My understanding is: yes, with a couple of exceptions.
The "yes" part is because your lightning node needs to look up the balance of each channel, and all functions where it looks up balances are passed to the bitcoin daemon. In order to look up a channel, which is a bitcoin address, you need to be able to look up whichever block it's in, and that could be any block, because a channel can be arbitrarily old. Therefore your bitcoin daemon needs to be able to access any given block in the blockchain, which requires the full thing.
The exception is if you connect your lightning wallet to someone else's node and trust them to give you accurate information. Eclair's lightning wallet does this, as does Neutrino mode in LND. In that case you don't need to download any blocks personally, because you're trusting someone else to do that for you and to feed you correct information.

Yes you can, by using a standard bip39 wallet. Just give the certifier the master public key for the branch you'll put your batching transactions through. You can keep the private keys totally secure and still destroy the privacy of all your transactions.


No, because (unless you're doing something funky) that's a peer-to-peer non-batched transaction for which neither of you cares if any certifier rubberstamps it. So you can feel free to exchange funds with your friend free of censorship. But if we live in a world where privacy isn't standardized, either of you could find out that the money you were sent by your buddy is not accepted by censored exchanges and censored payment processors because "This input is associated with an unregistered service blah blah and for security/legal purposes we blah blah." That's one reason why we need to enhance bitcoin's privacy now, with projects like Zerolink, Tumblebit, and Lightning. Make the effort now so that privacy and fungibility-enhancing solutions are adopted into the most popular wallets, and encourage people to switch to wallets that already integrate privacy solutions for every (or almost every) transaction. If more than 50% of transactions don't reveal the sender's real address (because the utxo got coinjoined or tumbled), then bitcoin services can't censor all of them while still maintaining profitability. At that point, bitcoin will be fully fungible.

Yes. I assume you mean "without using blockchain.com." The *real* bitcoin blockchain is a necessary part of transacting in bitcoin, but blockchain.com is not, nor is any other third party.


Yes, what you're describing is becoming a node on the network. Nodes are software that connect you to other people's computers to help send and receive transactions, including your own. There is a lot of open source node software, not controlled by any company, and by running it you can select any node on the network -- e.g. a miner's node -- and send your transactions directly to them for mining. Examples of node software include Bitcoin Core (a full node) and Electrum (a light node). Most wallets are made by companies who by default set your wallet to send your transactions to their own node, which is fine as long as they forward it to the rest of the network like they're supposed to. But if you don't trust a corporate wallet, download decentralized node software like Bitcoin Core or Electrum.
Note that even the two node programs that I just recommended use a DNS-like service by default which is prefilled with the IDs of other well-connected nodes -- but like I said, you can set them to connect to any node you want in the settings. If you want to connect directly to a miner, search google to get the node id of a miner and type that in in settings to get it to send a peer request directly to that miner. But be aware that miners don't always accept every new peer request that comes their way -- this is why bitcoin is a network; you don't need to *directly* connect to a miner because all peers on the network forward all transactions by default, so if you're connected to any ordinary peer your transactions will get to the miners within a few seconds. But if you want to dive in deep, go for it, send a peer request directly to a miner, and if his node doesn't accept, try again later, or find some other anonymous peer to connect to which isn't controlled by a corporation.

Schnorr can put a lot of signatures into a block but that doesn't negate the eventual need for a blocksize increase. Only some of the transaction data is signature data. Schnorr doesn't consolidate the "from" address or the "to" address afaik, nor does it change the number of bytes you need to use in order to specify the amount to send. If we see mainstream adoption, schnorr and mast and lightning will all need to be ready, and (when all that's fully prepared) we'll probably do a blocksize increase to somewhere around 8 mb.

Two thoughts: one, merchants already wait 1-3 days for debit card transactions to go from "pending" to "confirmed," and yet they let you pump your gas anyway. If someone started cancelling such transactions every time, they would stop selling that person gas, and it is reasonable to suspect that they would do the same with bitcoin: let them pump their gas, and if they start doing double-spends every time, stop selling them gas.
Second, merchants can make transactions go faster by sending the unconfirmed funds to a new address. If they pay a high fee, it will go through in the next block. Include that fee in your product's listed btc price, and just do it with every low-fee transaction for added security and speed.

1/ There can be no centralization on the lightning network. Centralization is when one person or group controls an activity. Routing partners cannot control your payment activity. Therefore, they cannot be centralized. No control = no centralization.
2/ Since routing partners do not have control of your payment activity they are also not "banks." Banks control your payment activity. Routing partners do not. Therefore they are nothing like banks.
3/ Miners do not need to accept bitcoin's upgrades. They can leave if they don't like our upgrades, we'll just get new miners by offering them fees to mine our transactions. And if no outside miners come, we'll start mining our own transactions.
4/ Routing partners can't stop you from making a payment via the lightning network. If a routing partner blocks your payment, you can open up a channel directly to your payee and still send him your payment over the lightning network. 
5/ There is no need for whales to create lightning channels and fund them with large amounts. Small channels can route payments just as well as large ones.
6/ Routing partners cannot collect accurate data on your payment activity. There is no way for routing partners to know if you are making a payment yourself or routing one for someone else.

@_date: 2017-09-28 02:39:23
All bitcoins are stored on something called a blockchain. They never leave it. What you can store is a private key, which is not quite a password but is similar to one in several ways. Your private key is a bunch of seemingly random numbers and letters which, when you use it, it lets you access your money. On a bitcoin website or smartphone app, the site or app stores your private key for you and accesses your money on your behalf, giving you simple buttons to push. But they can also lose your private key or get hacked, and you can lose your money if that happens.
The least safe way to store your private key is on a website, because websites can get hacked or go offline, and everyone who uses them can lose their money at once.
The next safest way to store your private key is on an app, which are more secure because typically it's less profitable for hackers to go after your particular phone and easier for them to go after a big company.
The next safest way to store your private key is on a paper wallet. As long as you keep it hidden and dry, and make a few backup copies, your money should be as safe as buried treasure that no one but you knows about.
The best way to store your private key is on a hardware wallet. These guide you through the process of making backups and are also safe against hackers and viruses. And they make it easy to spend your coins if that's what you want to do. (That's almost the only thing that makes them better than paper wallets actually.)
Hope that helps!

I use bitcoin indirectly for all my regular purchases by using a bitcoin-backed debit card. (I say indirectly because technically the bitcoins are turned into dollars when I send them to the card. But I'm okay with doing that until more business start accepting bitcoin directly.)
I don't have any other debit or credit card, nor any checks or other forms of payment. Bitcoin + the BTC debit card is my only way of transacting, unless I get cash somehow.
Also, every Friday I buy more BTCs as soon as my paycheck gets into my bank account. I almost always put 100% of it into bitcoin, unless I plan to buy something that day, in which case I'll keep that amount in cash because it's cheaper to do that than to pay the transaction fee.

Bitcoin loans do exist, but so far the only versions I have any information on are secured loans, which is a special type of loan where you offer something as collateral in case you can't pay back the loan in kind. I believe part of the contract for these loans says that if the price of bitcoin appreciates to a point where it is equal to your collateral's value, and/or if you don't make regular payments, the company loaning you the money has the right to sell your collateral for an amount of bitcoins equal to the amount they loaned you, and then you can keep the bitcoins you were loaned.
These are secured loans and, as far as I know, they are the only kind of bitcoin loan currently implemented by an actually existing company. (Bitfinex offers them, for one.)
Now, there are other types of loans, and it is certainly possible to create other loan arrangements using bitcoin as the underlying asset. For example, if you really really wanted an unsecured loan, you could probably get one by simply writing up a legally binding contract with someone where they give you a certain amount of bitcoins and you are legally obligated to pay them back with specified payments or else face some kind of legally enforceable penalty. If you violate the contract, the aggrieved party can take you to court and have the penalty enforced. So that's another way to do it, but I'm not aware of any companies who currently offer that as a service.

I don't think the cash app accepts crypto deposits unless they are through their own app. Otherwise they can't verify who purchased the coins, which they're required to by kyc regulations.
I just thought of a testable way to see if there's a workaround. You could export a small amount of bitcoin from the cash app to another wallet, then use the blockchain to see what address the exported coins came from. If the cash app uses standard bitcoin protocols, it should allow you to reuse addresses, so once you know what address it exported the coins from you might be able to send bitcoins to that address and receive them in the cash app. But it depends on how they manage it -- if you're gonna try this do it with a small amount, cause you could lose those coins if their implementation doesn't allow you to reuse addresses, or if addresses are centrally managed rather than tied to each individual's identity.

Exchanges typically keep an internal ledger of their users and their balances while keeping all the actual coins in one single wallet. When a user decides to move their coins off the exchange, or when someone send bitcoins to one of your addresses without themselves being on the exchange -- only in those two cases will you see an exchange actually broadcast a transaction to the blockchain. It is expensive and slow for exchanges to actually send transactions back and forth on the blockchain, so they just keep an internal ledger and only send a transaction to the blockchain when a user puts their money on some outside-of-the-exchange wallet or when someone not on the exchange sends money "to" a user on the exchange.

I don't think so. Lightning works between any two parties who want instant and nearly-free bitcoin transactions. One incentive to use it right now is because it allows you to have those features when you make payments to the companies who currently accept LN payments, such as Bitrefill, Torguard, and the Blockstream Store. You can make cheap instant payments right now with those companies -- and any merchant or customer who wants those features simply has to connect to the network as it exists now, even with few users.


You just need to give someone an electronic invoice. This process can be automated without your ongoing input. If you have a website, that website is online and can do it on its own. If you have a cash register computer, you can do it on there. If you just have a phone, you can just hit a "receive" button on there.


Same as above.


You could only lose money if the following conditions all happened: if your node stayed offline for the entire duration of one of your old transaction's locktimes, AND IF your counterparty thought his chances of defrauding you outweighed the risk of losing all the money he has in his payment channel with you, AND IF he also thought his chances of defrauding you Also outweighed the risk of getting caught through the legal system, AND IF he thought your node was unlikely to come back online before the locktime runs out, AND IF he thinks you don't have a watchtower program protecting your money, AND IF you actually Don't use a watchtower program to protect your money when you're offline, AND IF you can't prove his fraudulence against him in a court of law, THEN you could lose some money -- whatever amount was in your channel with him. LN has more safeguards to prevent you from losing money than most systems. BTW a watchtower service only needs to be about 5 lines of code, and can be run as a browser extension, a smartphone app, a distributed program, a cloud program on Amazon, or even a shared program on your friends's computers.


There are many solutions to  that I mentioned above.


The average person doesn't need to care about or understand them. Watchtowers are built into every lightning implementation. If you're the type of person who wants double extra security, then you clearly do care, and can put an extra watchtower program on Amazon's cloud service or wherever you like.


Why do you think there will be fees? Every LN implementation comes with an automated watchtower. Plus, additional watchtowers are very simple programs that you can run on any of your devices or any of your friends's devices if they agree. You can set it and forget it. I'm sure there will be some companies who offer to run a watchtower for you, but you don't need to use them because watchtower programs are simple enough to be implemented as a set-it-and-forget it app, extension, cloud program, or distributed program.


There can be no centralized hubs on the LN. Centralization is when a single person or group controls an activity. Routing partners can't control your payment activity, so there can be no centralization on the lightning network. No control = no centralization.


First, there can be no centralized hubs on the LN. Second, two new users can easily pay each other by setting up a payment channel with each other. There's a simple button -- "create a channel" -- with a simple instruction -- "scan the qr code of the person you want to connect to" -- and now you can pay that person directly over the LN, with no routing partner.


Funds on the LN are not locked up. You can remove them at any time. Moreover, you can spend them on the LN without removing them from the payment channel. So they are doubly not locked up. Also, what you describe as "locking up funds" here sounds identical to "sending someone money." If I thought you meant "no one is going to send their friend money because it locks their money up with their friend" then I would say that's a dumb argument, because sending someone money isn't locking up your money, it's getting rid of it. Moreover, even if "sending money" Was "locking up money" -- because you can no longer use it, I guess -- that Always happens when you send someone money. But I don't think that's what you mean, I think I'm just misunderstanding you.


You describe "locked up funds" as the cause of this alleged monthly fee. But funds on the LN are not locked up. The cause being removed, the effect is lifted: there is no reason for there to be a monthly fee for using a routing partner. Your routing partners can collect enough money through the standard routing fee. Also, if you think a particular routing partner is too big for your comfort level, just don't connect to him. Connecting to a specific routing partner is never mandatory.


If you mean "your routing partner could withdraw his money from his half of the channel so that your previous payments can't go through," no, that can't happen, for several reasons. First, the locktime prevents people from removing money from a channel quickly unless they have the consent of their counterparty. Second, if someone tries to remove their money from your channel without your consent, using the slower, lock-time method, your node (and/or any watchtower you choose) has a signed transaction from your routing partner sending you the money he has committed to you, which you can broadcast at any time. Since your counterparty tried to remove his money without your consent, he was forced to use the locktime method, which prevents his transaction from being mined until your node (and/or a watchtower) has had time to broadcast the latest transaction and get you your money (plus a possible fraud-blocker reward which takes all the money the defrauder had in the channel with you).


Routing partners are not subject to KYC requirements. Lightning nodes route data packets just like tcp/ip gateways and do not transmit any money. You do not need a KYC license to transmit data packets -- only to transmit money, which lightning nodes don't do. The blockchain is the only payment processor involved in the lightning network, and, just like with a normal bitcoin node, you don't need a kyc license to use the blockchain. Lightning nodes don't process payments, they just transmit data from one user to another so that each user can broadcast a blockchain transaction on their own whenever they want -- and users do not need a kyc license to do that.


First, there is no way to predict that, because we can't know how large payment channels will get. Second, if you can't make a large payment, break it up into small payments. Third, if you still can't use the LN for a large payment, pay using the blockchain. If for any reason people are unable to make large payments on the LN, that will be a clear sign that the LN is only good for small payments. But we can't know that will happen in the future from our current vantage point in the present.


This comment confuses me. I'm sure you don't mean the values transmitted are larger. Do you mean the settlement transactions have a larger number of bytes than a normal transaction? Because I don't think the bytesize difference is substantial. Can you provide more details?


They only need to keep track of that information if they want to gain a fraud-blocker reward in the event that their counterparty tries something fraudulent. If you're just interested in not losing coins, you just need to have a copy of the latest transaction you've signed -- and you might even have backups on one or more watchtower programs. If your node (or a watchtower program) sees a transaction enter the mempool from your payment channel which differs from the latest signed transaction, it has plenty of time to broadcast the latest one before the old one's locktime clears and stop the old one from getting mined. Old channel states can simply be discarded unless you're interested in the possible fraud-blocker reward. All you actually *need* is your latest signed transaction, or a backup copy, such as on one or more watchtower programs.

Any company can create a protection service on top of the LN. They would just have to get customers/merchants to agree to use a new type of wallet. Using a 2-of-3 multisig wallet instead of a 2-of-2 multisig wallet (which LN currently uses by default) is the key step. Here's how it would work.
When you create a payment channel, you could (optionally) select a service provider agreed to by the merchant to protect this channel from fraud. Let's call the service provider a watchdog. Your agreed-upon watchdog would have a third private key to this channel, even though only 2 private keys are needed to sign a transaction. Now you and your counterparty can go about your business, making your transactions. But if your counterparty does something bad, and won't use his private key to send you your money back, you could file a dispute with the watchdog, who could evaluate the claim and, if the right conditions are met, he could use his private key to sign a transaction from your payment channel sending you your money back.

That enforcement mechanism might be just the thing we need to turn this into an authoritarian society.

It is difficult to disagree with these sentiments, which are so reasonably put forward and especially since you don't take an extreme position, which is commendable. I will point out that I don't think it is an extreme position to hold that bitcoin has more intrinsic value than any fiat currency. For someone who takes that position, I think it is also quite reasonable to get all their money out of fiat currency and into bitcoin. The reason is simple: if you have good reasons to think that X is intrinsically valuable and Y is intrinsically valueless, then you may rationally conclude that it is of immense value to have 100% of X and 0% of Y. Do you think that is reasonable?

The hope is that we'll have a scaling solution in place by then. The lightning network's plan is to bundle small transactions together into one big one and then split a single transaction fee among many users.

The interface you are describing is possible but I'm not sure you could do it by directly taking your private key and encrypting it. You can do that IF you use an encryption method that still keeps visible whatever information is necessary to derive the public key from the private key, but I'm not sure if there's an encryption format that does that. (Though I suspect BIP38 does that.)
What you could do instead, to get the same result in a way I understand (not that that matters very much), is encrypt a private key using BIP38, copy the resulting random hash of text, paste it next to the public key associated with that encrypted private key (but separate them with a space or something), and create one qr code out of this combined long string of text. Then, develop some wallet software that has a qr reader which can read this unusual but perfectly valid type of qr code. It is easy to decode that qr code to its two underlying components -- a public key, and a BIP38 encryption of a private key. Then it could offer you the option to send money to the public key or withdraw money using the private key, after you've entered the passphrase of course.
I think this is a cool idea because it eliminates the need for multiple qr codes on a paper wallet and it's perfectly compatible with the current design of bitcoin. But be aware that reusing an address opens you up to a quantum attack if quantum computers are ever developed. It'sa cool idea, though. I wonder if I should develop a wallet that can do that?
Also, one of the benefits you've identified is that you won't have to hide your private key. But now you'll have to hide your passphrase, assuming you don't just want to rely on your memory. To me, that undermines that particular benefit. But this is still a cool idea, imo.

They will be almost as soon as the latest bch "upgrade" goes through. It introduces a checkpoint which will prevent the bsv chain from superceding the bch chain even if bsv gets more proof of work, by locking in blocks that are only on bch and saying "wallets on our network must ignore any chain that doesn't have these blocks." AFAIK most of the network nodes haven't yet downloaded and installed this "upgrade." They aren't fully divorced until then, so bsv could still theoretically overtake bch and become the "real" bch.
BTW there is still a way bsv could get around the "upgrade" -- by forking after the checkpoint. But the checkpoint changes to a new one every hour and forty minutes. This creates a very small, frequently changing window of time within which bsv has to do a lot of work to fork bch and overtake it. We'll see what happens. I'm sure Craig either has a response in the making, or he has already made one and it just hasn't filtered through to me yet.

I think it depends on the pressure they are put under. I think that so many ethereum users use custodial ethereum wallets, or spv wallets that connect to a custodial node, that the consensus model is broken and they have no real recourse if a government decides to tell the custodians what to do.


I understand that, and I am in favor of such forks. I am in favor of them (and you) deleting the Dao. I also think ethereum is even more "stoppable" today than it was then, because too many ethereum people are using custodial wallets and trusty spv wallets. They aren't -- and can't -- run a computer fast enough to keep up with the ethereum blockchain. Those who are running a standard ethereum node (which I presume you are doing) are, I think, not in a position to really outvote the custodians, partly because the only way the ethereum devs could make the standard node software work on an average pc was by autopruning, but moreso because the ethereum blockchain is so fast that an ordinary pc can't keep up with standard block propagation. If my understanding is correct, and I fully admit I might be wrong, but if I'm right, the people who can afford computers and bandwidth that can keep up with ethereum's blockchain are the same people who run the custodial wallets and the nodes that the spv wallets connect to. By consequence, ethereum is centralized around those custodians, and they can control what runs on the platform.
I agree with your points about etc being largely dead.
Keep in mind that I think ethereum has some value in its model where users pay for server side functions on a pay-as-you-go basis. This model has value, but its value does not come from being a decentralized platform for unstoppable code. Ethereum doesn't have those properties.

Routing partners may set a fee that they think outweighs the risk of their private keys getting stolen, which would give a hacker access to their money. Currently, the average fee is less than a satoshi, indicating that few routing partners think it's a high risk.

It doesn't allow more transactions to fit into a *1mb* block, it raised the blocksize limit to just under *4mb*, although the expectation is that it will rarely go over about 2.4mb. 70% more transactions can fit into a block because the blocksize limit is higher when it's full of segwit transactions.
What you might be thinking of is the pruning mechanism that ensures backward compatibility. Unupgraded nodes don't recognize blocks that are bigger than 1mb, while upgraded segwit-supporting nodes do. To keep the old nodes happy, segwit nodes prune the witness data from each segwit transaction when sharing these blocks with old nodes, and as a result these block appear to be 1mb when old nodes receive them. But that's just because old nodes aren't receiving the witness data. In reality, the blocks are bigger, and upgraded nodes realize that. That is why when you explore the blockchain at a place like coin.dance/blocks, almost all the blocks anymore are bigger than 1mb.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:09:41
Yes, by requiring witness data to be included in the same field as the rest of the transaction data. You could make this change via a soft fork because it does not relax any rules, it only tightens them.
BTW segwit is currently optional anyway. If you don't want to use it, just send a standard transaction to an address that starts with 1.

Because 10 minute transactions are faster than any other payment network available today. I know it doesn't "seem" like it, because when you use your debit card at a gas station or whatever you can walk out the door with your product before 10 minutes have elapsed. But if you look at your bank account, that transaction is almost always in a "pending" state for 1-3 days. That's how long it takes a bank to confirm transactions -- which is partly by design, because it gives you time to discover that maybe your identify was stolen, or that the product was bad, and then they can cancel the transaction before it is confirmed.
The merchant lets you leave with the product, even though the transaction is "pending," because the banking system is trustworthy enough that merchants don't mind waiting 1-3 days. The thing is, bitcoin is more trustworthy, and also much faster -- 10 minutes versus 1-3 days. Have you tried paying with bitcoin by sending payment to a payment processor such as Bitpay? You don't need to wait 10 minutes. Just like with credit cards, you can leave immediately, with your product, and later the transaction gets confirmed when you are gone. The difference is, with bitcoin, the transaction goes through in 10 minutes, while with a Visa card (or their competitors), it goes through in 3 days. Bitcoin is Much faster than any other payment system we have today.

All bitcoins are stored on a public ledger on the internet. Your balance on this ledger is secured by a sort-of password called a private key. (Technically, it's not a password, but it has a few similar features.) You can transfer coins from one person to another with apps that use your private key to access your money on the public ledger and transfer some of it to another person. A paper wallet is just a copy of your private key -- your "password" to your money -- written on a piece of paper. To use it, you can either scan the private key with a bitcoin app and it will use it to access your money, or you can just hand the piece of paper to someone and let them do that with their own phone. It's a pretty simple system.
The best thing about paper wallets is that they are nearly as secure as more expensive storage mechanisms such as hardware wallets, except they are as cheap as a sticky note. (Plus you can make backup copies.) The only way someone can access your money, if you have a paper wallet, is if you tell them your private key, or give them the paper wallet. Barring that, your money is more secure on a paper wallet than it is in your bank account. Which is amazing -- because it's just a piece of paper with a "password" written on it.

You can, that is one way of manually implementing a form of replay protection for your own coins only. But it is difficult to do it correctly. If you do it correctly, you can control each coin separately.
The reason it is difficult to do it correctly is because any movement you make on the BTG blockchain can be instantly "replayed" (copied) on the BTC blockchain. Then, whatever address you send to on BTG, your BTCs get sent to that address too, which is not what you want. But there are ways to make that not happen if you know what you are doing.

You can still do a justice transaction if your counterparty cheats. When he broadcasts an old transaction, you can broadcast the latest one, and it will take any funds in his half of the channel. Just because one party funded the channel doesn't mean that party's the only one with money in it -- every time a transaction is made the balance moves from one side to the other, and this allows either party to punish the other one for cheating.

No, it wouldn't require a consensus change. Unconfirmed transactions would go into the mempool and get shared with earth nodes whenever the planets are in sync. If they got into a Mars block which gets wiped out during the sync, they'll go back into the mempool (which gets shared with Earth during the sync) and wait for a confirmation in the new consensus chain (which will probably always be Earth's, unless people on Mars start making more on-chain transactions than Earth people).

Sure. There are two main components of the picture: colored lines, and boxes with names in them, such as Sleepyark. The boxes with names in them represent each node on the network. That is, they represent each lightning-enabled wallet. The colored lines represent each channel on the network. That is, they represent each route from one node to another, each connection between two wallets. For example, a node called StrangeGopher is one of the nodes connected to the node called Spock. StrangeGopher is either an individual or a group or a machine. He's got a lightning wallet, that's the box with his name in it, and he's got a channel between himself and Spock, which means he can make payments to Spock. Spock is another individual or group or machine. He's got a bunch of channels to many different nodes. He can make payments to a lot of people.
If you get a lightning wallet, and want to make a payment to someone on the lightning network, you first need to connect your wallet (your node) to a node on the network, creating a route (a channel) between you and that node. You could connect directly to the person you want to pay, but you don't need to connect to him *directly*. As long as you are connected to someone who is connected to someone who is connected to someone (etc.) who is connected to the guy you want to pay, then you can pay him.
I'm not sure why Recksplorer uses different colored lines for each channel, so you'll have to ask someone else to find out that info. Does that help?

@_date: 2018-11-18 19:28:55


Whatever attackers are doing to the chain of channels doesn't affect you. Your money only comes from your payment channel with your counterparty, and you have the latest transaction guaranteeing you that money. Outside attackers can't do anything to that channel. Moreover, your counterparty can't do a locktime attack for free -- doing a locktime attack requires him to broadcast the latest transaction (or an old, now-fraudulent transaction) and close the channel. There is a mining fee for that, plus his money goes into the locktime too, and he now has to make another onchain transaction if he wants to open a new channel to replace the one he closed. And if he happens to broadcast a fraudulent transaction, there is an additional cost: he could lose all the money he has in the payment channel if you or a watchtower catches him. These are all costs to himself, and the only thing he gets from it is that all your money gets returned to you when the locktime runs out -- plus a possible fraud-blocker reward if he didn't broadcast the latest transaction you agreed to.


Good point. I think we should put in an easy fix button right under the "no route available" dialog box: "Would you like to create a channel directly to the payee? It will cost X.XX bitcoins." Do you think that would solve the problem? You could also give them the option to do a blockchain payment: "You can also pay him using the blockchain. A blockchain payment will cost X.XX bitcoins."


This appears to be the same as "Lightning will not be able to route large payments," and has the same solutions. Unless I'm misunderstanding you, which is of course quite possible. If I'm misunderstanding you, would you please clarify? Thanks!


Not necessarily. If you have an "empty" lightning channel (e.g. no outgoing capacity), but it's still open, you can refill it via lightning using any of several methods. Most people in the medium term will probably withdraw from a lightning-compatible bitcoin exchange. As bitcoin adoption grows, you likely won't need exchanges anymore, but can pay a friend $50 in fiat to send your "empty" channel $50 worth of bitcoin. That would grant you more outgoing capacity without requiring an onchain transaction.


Creating a new channel shouldn't happen very often even over the course of your lifetime. If people typically receive their bitcoins over the LN then they shouldn't need to create many channels for that, and they should be able to send money to anyone on the network even if they only have a few channels. Moreover, the times when they have to close a channel and then open a new one should be very rare. This is because closing a channel has too many negatives and almost no positives. Almost the only thing it does is move your money to yet another address under your control (which lightning channels already are) and takes away the advanced features of a lightning channel such as increased speed, increased cheapness, and increased privacy. I don't expect many people to want to close their channels and open new ones.


We don't have a 1mb blocksize limit anymore. The blocksize limit is almost 4 mb and we expect the average size of blocks to be above 2 mb.




I haven't given enough thought to the amount of transaction fees that would be required to maintain the security provided by having many powerful miners, and thus I cannot answer this problem. I hope someone else has done the math better than me. I will mention that I expect there to be more onchain transactions than 170 million, due to some people preferring onchain transactions and the need to occasionally open and close lightning channels. But I haven't done any math to estimate how many transactions that could create. Thank you for sharing your concerns, I hope this response is helpful.

Perhaps the cheapest option is to print a paper wallet from bitaddress.org and get the "public address" blown up to a sufficiently large size. Then just have people send bitcoins to that public address, and you can use the private key to access them.
Do you want to keep them as BTC or sell them for USD? If the latter, you could set up a Coinbase account and use your receiving addresses at that website to receive bitcoins, then import them (for free) to the Gdax exchange to sell them for USD with no fees.
The hardest thing is to train your employees to figure out how many bitcoins is the current equivalent to the USD price. You don't want your customers overpaying, right? One option to make this easier is to show your cashiers how to use Google for this purpose. If you search "$11 in bitcoins" right now on Google, it will display the equivalent BTC price for specific USD amounts. If someone wants to pay for a product in your shop with bitcoins, have your employees search Google for that phrase (with the dollar amount being whatever the product costs in USD) and then tell your customers to send that amount of bitcoins to your public address.

Miners don't charge transaction fees. Users set them voluntarily when creating each transaction, and miners may choose the highest ones. If they don't make enough from these fees, they'll just turn off their mining rigs, and wait for the difficulty to adjust downwards, which makes bitcoin profitable again.

Your counterparty doesn't have your private keys, so he can't do a double spend unless he broadcasts an outdated transaction -- which, if he tries that without your approval, the transaction is timelocked. That timelock if there so that you have time to broadcast the most up to date transaction before the old one is eligible for inclusion within a block, and get your money.

I believe Poloniex offers collateralized lending. But the borrower does not get the private keys of the bitcoins he borrows and therefore he only has a few lender-approved things he can buy with the borrowed bitcoins, which are presented to him as buttons -- push button A to buy product A, push button B to buy product B. If the borrower can't pay back the bitcoins, or if the value of the bitcoins grows to a point where it equals the value of the collateral, the lender stops offering bitcoins to the borrower and buys back the lost bitcoins with the collateral. Is that the kind of lending model you're thinking of?

I used an ATM when I first started and it turned out to be the right decision. BTC was around $1350 and had just climbed there after a crash following the SEC decision to not allow a bitcoin fund on the stock market (I think? I can't quite remember what caused the crash. It was mid April 2016). I didn't have an account set up on any site like Coinbase, and those things take up to a week to get verified. So I bought .70 of a bitcoin at an ATM, ate the fees, and ended up recovering that money faster than I would have by waiting a week to verify an account. Bitcoin was on a tear that whole month.

If the price rises from $1k to $1,5k and you sell one coin on Coinbase, you'll get $500, minus a fee charged by Coinbase for facilitating the trade. If it drops, you can purchase again instantly, you don't need to wait to purchase more coins (unless you don't have any cash), but before you can sell a coin you need confirmation from Coinbase that you have it.
Regarding selling, the person who pays you is a trader on the more professional looking (and faster) Gdax platform, which is owned by Coinbase. Gdax traders can place "buy orders" at whatever price they want. As soon as someone offers to sell a coin at that price or lower, their order gets filled. (In case that's confusing, keep in mind that traders don't mind getting a coin for a different price than they asked for if it's a *lower* price. They're getting what they want for a better deal.) So when you click "sell," you are selling to a trader who has a buy order open on Gdax where he offered to buy bitcoins for the price you offered to sell at -- or he might have offered to buy them at a higher price, in which case he'll be very grateful that you sold him a coin at an even lower price than he wanted.
I forget how long it takes to receive cash from Coinbase. If memory serves, it's instant "on paper," that is, a number shows up in your "USD" wallet instantly, but when you try to transfer that to your bank account I think it takes like a week.

Because increasing the block size costs each network operator money -- electricity costs as well as internet bandwidth costs. Network operators are the ones who decide these things, and they are too sensible to spend more money than they have to, especially considering the fact that they are all unpaid volunteers (well, except for the miners, who are a very small percentage of network operators. They do get paid, so that's nice for them, but they are also only a small percentage of network operators and the rest of them aren't paid for their work -- so they try to keep costs as low as possible).

You don't have to hold bitcoins to accept them as a form of payment. There are payment programs that let your customer pay whatever is the current exchange rate, and then it immediately sells those coins for dollars. You don't personally have to deal with bitcoins on your end -- the protocol works as a vehicle for receiving dollars, where bitcoins are only used on the backend (and by the payer).

Suppose the developers want to put in an update, but there are two different proposals for how to do it. Right now, the developers who like one version just run that version, and the other developers run the other version. Under this (current) model, every developer gets to do what they want, and every user gets to pick and choose their favorite versions. Under your voting model, if I'm understanding you correctly, developers couldn't just put in what they want and let the users pick and choose, they'd have to put everything up for a vote first, and Then the users would have a choice to use the new version or not. The voting model still inhibits freedom because right now developers get to do their own thing and let the best software win. Under the voting model, they have to do what everyone else tells them, which isn't freedom.

Suppose there was only a $5 block reward, only from transaction fees. A bunch of miners would see that they can't pay their bills with $5 block rewards, and they'd shut off their equipment. The difficulty would adjust downwards, and even if all the "big" miners left, the difficulty would just make it easy for anyone to mine. Want a cheap $5? Mine a bit! You see, it doesn't matter to bitcoin to keep the mining reward high. And fees don't need to go up to keep miners happy. If some aren't happy, they'll leave, and the difficulty will adjust accordingly.

A 51% attack is where you do a double-spend. Don't confuse that with a chainsplit attack. At best, a successful 51% attack can let you send coins to an address and then take them back again. It didn't let you change bitcoin's rules. What you are thinking of is called a chainsplit attack, not a 51% attack, and for that to become dominant you don't need 51% of the miners, you need 51% of the users to move to your new fork. Mining power doesn't get you 51% of the users. They have to make their own choice.

Bitcoin loans do exist, but so far the only versions I have any information on are secured loans, which is a special type of loan where you offer something as collateral in case you can't pay back the loan in kind. I believe part of the contract for these loans says that if the price of bitcoin appreciates to a point where it is equal to your collateral's value, and/or if you don't make regular payments, the company loaning you the money has the right to sell your collateral for an amount of bitcoins equal to the amount they loaned you, and then you can keep the bitcoins you were loaned.
These are secured loans and, as far as I know, they are the only kind bitcoin loan currently implemented by any kind of actually existing company. (Bitfinex offers them, for one.)
Now, there are other types of loans, and it is certainly possible to create other loan arrangements using bitcoin as the underlying asset. For example, if you really really wanted an unsecured loan, you could probably get one by simply writing up a legally binding contract with someone where they give you a certain amount of bitcoins and you are legally obligated to pay them back with specified payments or else face some kind of legally enforceable penalty. If you violate the contract, the aggrieved party can take you to court and have the penalty enforced. So that's another way to do it, but I'm not aware of any companies who currently offer that as a service.

You might buy coins at a higher value if there aren't enough bitcoins for sale at the current market value. For example, suppose there are only 3 coins for sale at $9,400, and you want 10 coins. You can offer to pay $9,400 for the first 3 coins and then $9500 for the next 7 coins, and in that case you are likely to find a seller, because other traders will see your offer as a good deal. (BTW this behavior pushes the overall price up.)

Your second paragraph is correct. However, it does not take extra time to confirm a full block versus confirming one with 50 transactions. Whether you do 0 transactions or 1000 transactions, you still have to find a hash of the previous block's ID number, and finding that hash has the same difficulty no matter what other data is in the new block. Once you find it, your new block is added to the blockchain regardless of how full it is. You can even mine a completely empty block and still get the 12.5 btc reward -- but you'll get More reward if you put some fee-including transactions in your block, and it doesn't cost you anything extra so that's what we expect most miners to do.

As a seller if you sell using the Coinbase "sell" button you are charged more in fees than if you sell directly to other buyers on the Gdax platform. You also get better tools by using the Gdax trading platform, such as a depth chart, which tells you how many buy orders and sell orders there are at each price, and a candlestick chart, which tells you how much the price moved up or down over any given timeframe. Some traders think they can find trends in such charts and use those trends to predict increases or decreases in the price, and hopefully profit by timing their buys and sells based on whether they think the price will go up or down. Gdax traders also get automated bots. For example, you can set a bot to automatically buy 2 bitcoins if the price goes down to $8k, and/or automatically sell a bitcoin if the price goes up to $11k. These tools are only available to Coinbase customers if they use Gdax. If you just use the simple "buy" and "sell" buttons on Coinbase, you don't get those features, and you get charged higher fees. That's why some traders prefer to use the more advanced platform, which also involves selling directly to other buyers, and buying directly from other sellers.

You could create paper wallets funded with a specified amount of bitcoins timelocked for 20 years. They couldn't be spent or transferred on the blockchain for 20 years, but the physical note containing the private key could be passed around that whole time.
The problem is, anyone who had the physical note at any time could copy the private key and then try to be the first one to make the transfer once the 20 years are up. Unless it was embedded inside the note in such a way that the only way to get the private key out is to destroy the physical copy.

His first criticism involves the assumption that many people will want to use non-LN wallets, and it's hard to do LN payments to non-LN wallets. But it's an easy fix. Use a blockchain transaction if someone wants to use a non-LN wallet. But also, notify them that they can have instant transactions with lower fees if they switch to a LN wallet. Using lightning is optional, but much better.
His second criticism is that closing a lightning channel takes too long. It doesn't need to. You can specify with each LN transaction how long you want its locktime to be. For your closing transaction, you can set an instant locktime and you're gold. Your counterparty has no reason to stop you from making an instant closing transaction, because you're closing the channel anyway.
His third criticism is that you need to be online to receive LN payments. In fact you just need to give someone an electronic invoice. This process can be automated without your ongoing input. If you have a website, that website is online and can do it on its own. If you have a cash register computer, you can do it on there. If you just have a phone, you can just hit a "receive" button on there. (Apparently these solutions don't apply to his situation because his website isn't the one receiving a payment from his customers, but rather his customers receive small payments from him for creating unique content. See my last big paragraph for more details and another possible solution.)
His fourth criticism is that you can't have offline cold storage channels. But you can. You can keep the private keys to any of your lightning channels offline and have that be your cold storage wallet. And you can keep a different one at quick access on your phone or wherever for daily payments.
His fifth criticism is that you need to constantly monitor the mempool for fraudulent transactions. But in fact your node just needs to check on the mempool often enough that it can catch any fraudulent transaction before its locktime runs out. And btw, a watchtower program is built into every lightning wallet. If you have it running on your phone wallet or your desktop, and you get online every once in a while, you've got nothing to worry about. Your counterparty has no way to know if you're gonna be offline for long enough for him to do something fraudulent, and he also doesn't know if you have an independent watchtower program running on a cloud service or a friend's computer somewhere. If he tries something fraudulent and he's caught, he loses all the money he has in his channel with you as a penalty, so game theory says it is seldom that anyone will attempt something fraudulent, and when anyone tries they will almost always be caught and penalized. Moreover, if you want double extra security, an independent watchtower program only needs to be about 5 lines of code, and can be run as a browser extension, a smartphone app, a distributed program, a cloud program on Amazon, or even a shared program on your friends's computers.
His sixth criticism is that you can't make a low initial lightning payment. "You can't make a payment lower than bitcoin's fees" -- which he says are $5 right now. And he also says the only way to solve this is if people "only ever use the lightning network." That's almost all wrong. You can use lightning to make a low initial lightning payment -- just put a low amount in your lightning channel. Moreover, bitcoin's onchain fees are as low as bcash's right now. So you can put as small an amount as you like in your initial lightning channel. Especially if your counterparty is an exchange -- I expect exchanges to put a lot of money into a channel with you so that they don't have to open up new channels every time you make a purchase.
His seventh criticism is that if there's a security problem you don't have access to your money. Yes, you do. You have a signed transaction from your counterparty giving you your money. Broadcast it. To me this is like saying "It's not safe to receive a check from a secured account instead of cash. Because if your client tries to close that account, you have no way to access your money." Um, just cash the check, it's a secured account and therefore you know the money is still there. It's similar with the LN -- its wallets automatically check the blockchain to ensure that the money for each transaction is in the associated address. And it can't leave that address without your consent because it's a multisig address and you've got half the keys to it. Moreover, whenever LN wallets receive a transaction they receive a signature for the amount agreed upon to be withdrawn from an address they're constantly monitoring. So you can broadcast that signed transaction -- that "check" -- whenever you like for guaranteed access to that money.
His eighth criticism is that lightning wallets are heavy on code and it costs money to run wallets that have a lot of code. Anyone can see how much these wallets cost by downloading a free lightning wallet such as Zap wallet or Eclair. Does it cost you a lot of money to run that free code? No? Hmm. Actually, that's not really a fair comparison for what this gentleman is talking about. He mentions that part of the reason it costed him so much money was because he was developing the code on his own -- probably there were no plugin payment solutions available yet when he was making his website. But he mentions in the video that there will probably be pre-coded solutions available pretty soon for use-cases like his, which I thought was an admirable admission.
At the same time, his eighth criticism involves that the lightning network wouldn't work with what his company wanted to offer their customers. If I understand correctly, he wanted to be able to send micropayments to his customers without their ongoing input. Apparently this involved a website where you (the customer) create social media content and then his website sends you a payment worth pennies or something, I'm not sure how it all works, but I'm guessing other people pay you for your content and his service acts as some sort of mediator. But his customers would have to be online to create an invoice whenever someone wants to pay them for their content. He's right that you can't count on your customers being online all the time to create an invoice at unscheduled intervals, and the average customer is also also unlikely (at least for now) to have an automated online program which the merchant can ping for an invoice whenever it wants. I don't know what his business model is exactly, but I wonder if he could do a workaround by having the money the customer wants to receive get saved up until they are online and ready to receive a payment.
I think those are just about all of his criticisms.

If the value suddenly dropped to $20, all the miners -- or at least the ones who have to pay for their electricity -- would have to abruptly stop spending $1000s per month on equipment that only gets them a few $20s in coins. They would need to sell their remaining coins to cover their last electricity bill, and the network hashrate would crash to almost nothing. Any remaining mining pools would only contain miners who get free electricity, and this small number of miners would be unlikely to solve a block hash on their own for weeks on end. Transactions would halt for a long time, by which I mean, until software developers released a hardfork that adjusts the difficulty downward, which would inevitably result in many different implementations, and many new bitcoin chains. It would be terrible.

You need to look up other people's channels in order to find potential routes. Lightning doesn't route the same way the internet does, where you send your packet to a node 1 step closer to your destination and let that node figure it who to send it to next. (Well, I guess it *could* route packets that way, but no current implementations do.) Instead, your lightning node figures out the whole route on its own, and then sends the payment information along its way. The route returns as valid if the other nodes along the route say they can forward it to the next one; if they don't respond or respond that they can't help, then it returns as an invalid route, and your node tries another one until it finds a valid route or runs out of options.
You are correct that your node is unable to see the current distribution of each channel, and therefore finding routes with lightning involves trial and error, at least in current implementations -- all you can see is that a given channel has enough money in it to forward your transaction, but you don't get to see which "half" of the channel that money is on, which means the payment could fail even though there is enough money in the channel -- like if most of the money is on a dead-end side of the channel.

You can open payment channels with other bitcoin users right now, and use them for atomic swaps and other functions. I wonder if you could make a case that it's partially implemented right now because of these features. I believe the main thing still to be added is the ability to automatically pass bitcoins to a person you're not directly connected to by routing them through a third party who you're both connected to (so long as the third party has enough bitcoins in the payment channel with you and in the payment channel with the other guy to complete the transaction).

Quantum resistant private key generators already exist that work with bitcoin. In fact, the most popular private key generators use the seed word model, and those ones are quantum resistant. This is because they do not reuse addresses, but create a new one for each transaction.
To explain why this makes them quantum resistant, let me use algebra as an example. In order to solve some types of algebraic formulas, you need to know two variables. Take as an example the formula X+Y+Z=100. If you are asked to solve for Z, and the only variable you know is X, then the number of possible values for Z is infinite. Even a quantum computer can't handle the boundaries of an infinite data set. Thus, even if you have a quantum computer, you need to know two variables in order to find the correct value in some types of formulas.
Now let's apply this to bitcoin addresses. Bitcoin addresses use a hashing algorithm that gives them a similar resistance to quantum computing as the above algebraic example. There is an infinite set of numbers that Could result in the hash you put on the blockchain. If you only use the private keys to that address once, to create one transaction, then you've only put one "variable" out there. In order for a hacker to set up an equation that solves for the private key, he needs two variables -- and he needs that even if he has a quantum computer.
The seed word model of bitcoin address generation uses this property to create quantum resistant private keys. It's actually quite simple: when you put money in an address generated by a seed word model, you broadcast one transaction, and that transaction is not from the newly generated address, but from an already existing one. When you remove the money from the new address by sending it to another, only at that point do you broadcast a transaction from that address using its private keys. At that point, a hacker with a quantum computer could figure out what the private key to that address was, except, to his chagrin, you only revealed the variable he needs at the very moment when you broadcasted the transaction that moves the money out of that address. He can crack the private key now, but there's no money in it anymore. Seed word models don't reuse the address -- if they move money out, they move the whole amount out, and if there is any change they send it to a new address that has not been previously used. Thus a quantum-powered hacker has no way to steal your money if you use a seed word protocol, which happens to be the most popular protocol for address creation anyway.
Note that this security model does not prevent a quantum computer from taking over mining. If a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qubits gets built and starts mining, it could indeed take 51% of the mining hashrate. But note: a 51% attack does not allow you to steal someone's private keys. The worst thing you can do with a 51% attack is censor payments from addresses you don't like. And if quantum computers do get built, it is likely that it won't take long before there are several of them competing to mine bitcoins. This will incentivize miners to take transactions that others don't, which is already how we incentivize miners not to censor transactions. Moreover, if a quantum computer gets 51% of the hashrate for a significant amount of time, and if that miner also starts censoring transactions, all it takes to solve the problem is to kick that miner off the network. This can even be done via a softfork -- which means we're pretty safe from that happening. And we could also switch to a quantum resistant algorithm. It is likely that the same inventions that power quantum technology will also power new forms of quantum resistant technology. In the game of cat and mouse that follows, bitcoin devs will likely implement quantum resistance as fast as miners implement quantum hashrates.

I'd like your perspective on something since you develop software. I've often heard that you can't separate blockchain technology from bitcoin because blockchains are expensive enough to run that they need some sort of valuable token reward to incentivize miners. I think part of the assumption behind this argument is that bitcoin is the simplest form of this valuable token, and therefore whatever blockchain you're running, either pure bitcoin or a nonpure version of bitcoin (i.e. an altcoin) is necessarily going to be part of it. What's your take? Are these assumptions and conclusions correct?

All coins are stored on the internet inside the blockchain. Your paper wallet just has your private key to the address where your bitcoin is stored on the internet.

There'll be two copies of the lightning network, one on each chain. The lightning network is a network of bitcoin payment channels, and payment channels can be made on either chain. The trick is finding a way to hook payment channels together so that you can pay people through a channel without being Directly connected to the guy you're paying, but only hooked into the same network of channels he's on. Once a method has been created which allows you to connect payment channels together and pass transaction information through them, people on each chain will start setting them up on their chain. Also, since both chains have Segwit, both of them can use atomic swaps, so if you need to send a payment to someone on the NYA chain and you're on the BTC chain, you'll be able to instantly swap BTCs for an amount of NYA coins that is equivalent to however much you need to pay the other guy, and send it to him on that network.

Miners are payed with transaction fees too. The loss in profits from the lack of newly generated bitcoins will push some miners out, the difficulty will adjust downward, and new miners will mine to get the profits from transaction fees, which are smaller but still a reason to mine. Even if only 1 person in the whole world wanted to mine because the profit was only $5, the network would adjust it's difficulty to let him do that, and he would mine a block every 10 minutes (and get a little bit of $$$ in transaction fees each time).

There are two reasons why a transaction could take hours to confirm. One is if the customer sends the btcs using a low fee, or no fee. This can result in a transaction taking a SUPER long time -- and even being refunded if it doesn't get into a block after 2 weeks. But here's one of the great things about bitcoin: even if the customer sets a low fee, you can replace it with a higher fee yourself, as the receiver of the money (though it comes from your own pocket). When a transaction is initiated, it shows up in your wallet after about 5 seconds, but with "zero confirmations." If you are worried that a transaction won't go through because it hasn't gotten confirmed for a while, you can re-send that unconfirmed money to a different address, one that is under your control, and set a high fee for this transaction using your own money. This is called "child pays for parent," and it uses a property of bitcoin called "unconfirmed inputs." (Google those for more info.) If the fee you set is high enough to get the transaction into the next block, you are likely to get the money in 10 minutes.
Here's the takeaway: you can include that "extra fee" as part of your price and tell your customers to not worry about setting a fee. It'll be included in the price. (Right now, 200 satoshis per byte should get you into the next block no problem, and there are an average of 226 bytes per transaction. So, you could include an extra 45200 satoshis to each transaction -- that's 226 bytes times 200 satoshis per byte for you math afficionados out there -- and use that to get each transaction confirmed in the next block.)
The other way a transaction can take a long time to confirm is if the network just happens to be finding blocks slowly that day. The random nature of the block algorithm means that there's something like a 10% chance that a block won't be found for 25 minutes or more, and around 18 blocks in every two week period take 40 minutes or more to find. There's nothing you can do about that unless you become a miner and purchase equipment that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. But for the low-fee problem, just set the fee yourself and tell your customers not to worry about it.
BTW consider this: I assume you, as a merchant, already accept debit cards. Don't transactions take several days to go from "pending" to "confirmed" if the customer uses a debit card? But you don't make them wait. Why make them wait with bitcoin? Can't you let them leave with their product and receive the money whenever the transaction confirms? It'll probably Still be faster than a debit card -- unless I'm wrong and it doesn't take them 1-3 days. What is your experience on this point? I'm always telling people that merchants should be ecstatic to go from 1-3 day confirmation times with Visa to 10 minute confirmation times with Bitcoin. Am I wrong to say so?

I believe inflation is when a currency's supply increases faster than its demand. I.e. More money gets printed than the market is using. So far, I believe bitcoin's demand has almost always exceeded its supply, but it is possible that briefly -- perhaps during the long crash of 2013 -- more bitcoins were created than the market wanted. If that happened, then it would be inflation, driving down the value of BTCs (temporarily). It's probably happened at least once since bitcoins have been created, because it hasn't always been an upward market, but new bitcoins have always been in production.

Also, if you look at the Johoe Mempool website (which is another way of measuring the optimum fee), transactions that are set at 70 satoshis per byte have been confirming quickly all day. That's a 96 cent transaction. That's a lot, but it is also a lot less than $6.

The most noticable government thing that shuts down is a few national parks and tourist attractions, and not even all of them close up if the people running them think they're important for local tourism. Even during a government "shutdown," federal workers still get their paychecks, senators and representatives still go to congress, the president still does whatever he does (golf?), and the social safety net still gets filled with money. Nothing important "shuts down" and most of the unimportant stuff stays open too.

Miners don't control the blockchain. What miners do is, as new transactions get sent to the network, miners collect them into blocks and verify that they are legit by doing some mathematics work. (It's more complicated than what I'm about to say, but part of it is addition and subtraction: "this user wants to send 1 BTC from this address to this other one. Does the first address have enough? Yes. Add 1 BTC to the second address and subtract it from the first address." That's simple math on the surface, but since it all uses encryption there's a lot of calculation that goes into it to make it secure and keep it working in 10 minute increments.)
That's the job of miners: adding and subtracting (complicated adding and subtracting, yes, but that's what it is). They can't add your bitcoins to their own accounts because they don't have the private keys. They can't create new private keys to your accounts because the math dictates that only your private key can work. They can't "steal" your private keys because your private keys aren't on the blockchain, that are only in your hands. Miners don't control the blockchain -- they just ensure that the additions and subtractions you want to do are valid. 
They can't make any transactions on anyone else's behalf because they don't have the private keys to already-existing accounts and can't create new ones to already-existing accounts, nor can they inflate the number of bitcoins that will exist in the future. They have no power. Therefore we don't need to worry that bad actors will start mining -- they can't do anything bad because they have no power over the blockchain.

It's possible to use cookies in web browsers (which are not anonymous) to find out that a person has bitcoins, if they aren't careful with how they purchase and what sites they purchase stuff from. It is also possible to track a bitcoin's movements until it is voluntarily turned into fiat money, which typically happens through gateways which know a person's name (which is by definition not anonymous). But bitcoin itself does not know your name, and your name is not recorded on the blockchain. This is what the article is talking about when it calls bitcoin anonymous, and it is perfectly defensible in doing so. Using non-anonymous services to buy goods, bitcoins, or cash, is optional. You can be totally anonymous if you buy bitcoins anonymously, store them anonymously, and be sure to spend them only using services that can't get at your identity.

I think you are just about 100% right about obfuscated code, but I will bring up two counter points: first, I am not personally aware of any wallets that use obfuscated code, and I think if any gets released reddit will go crazy -- especially if the obfuscation surrounds how they handle private keys. Second, obfuscated code could also be released as open source software. Open sourcing something cancels your legal copyrights over it. It doesn't mean you additionally published something on GitHub. Anyone can get a copy of your code if you have software on the market available for download; but if it's closed source, that just means they aren't allowed to copy it.

Lightning devs can't change the rules without consensus. Lightning wallets are just as open source as any other bitcoin client.

Only if people download and use those changes do they become the new form of the lightning network, and that's the consensus model.

That protocol has been an open source part of bitcoin since 2013 and it introduced many useful features. The fact that so few wallets implemented it is the real problem, because BIP70 Payment Protocol is actually a really good technology. Bitpay is pushing wallet makers to finally implement it, and that, at least, is good to see.

Updates in bitcoin are optional, and no one has to use an added feature if they don't want to. Updates cannot change what you could do previously with bitcoin; they can only give you additional features that you can use if you want to. 
It's like when the first person invented plowing. As in, plowing a field. Ever since plowing was invented, no one can stop you from doing it. People might "update" the methods of plowing by saying, Hey, you can have a horse do this, or you can use this particular fancy tool, or an electric plow or have a tractor pull a plow -- but those "updates" are all optional.
No government or organization "changed what plowing is," and no government or organization can "change what bitcoin is." But they can invent new things you can do with it. Segwit transactions and atomic swaps and forks are all optional "new things you can do with bitcoin" that you can use if you want to. No one can change what bitcoin fundamentally is though, anymore than you can change what plowing is.

It seems you are asking about the consequences of centralization. One consequence is that centralized technology is at risk. It is easier for the government to find a few people and incentivize them to comply with the government's whims than it is to find 10k nodes and force them to comply. Centralization also puts you at greater risk of hacking, because there are fewer copies of the ledger to corrupt, and it puts you at risk of letting bitcoin come under the complete control of a corporation, who could theoretically (if bitcoin was centralized) change the consensus rules and make it just another PayPal.

Amazon Web Services runs unstoppable if we ignore the exceptions. It's the potential for massive growth in exceptions that I'm concerned about. Right now, ethereum is a great place to put your program if it works with ethereum's limitations. So is Amazon Web Services. But what if your program gets banned? If the government goes up to Amazon and says "Delete this person's code," Amazon will comply because it doesn't run unstoppable code -- unless we ignore the exceptions. It is my understanding that Ethereum's platform is centralized enough that a small group can delete unpopular code from the platform. I may be wrong in that understanding. If I'm right, then what is to stop the government or other powerful people from going up to that small group and saying, "This code is illegal (or 'we don't like it'). Remove it from your platform or we'll jail you (or 'because we'll pay you to remove it')"? If they can delete the Dao, can't they delete anything on their platform?
BTW I'm not entirely sure I'm correct. Perhaps it is less centralized than I believe -- I'd love to be corrected.


I'm in favor of deleting bad code. I think it was good to get rid of the Dao, after it was discovered to be hackable. But I don't think ethereum is a platform for unstoppable code. I think ethereum is like Amazon Web Services, a service I admire, with several major exceptions. One exception is that instead of one trusted party hosting the code on their servers all the time, users can pay miners to fire up the software they want to run on an ad hoc basis -- which is a cool. Also, ethereum is a lot slower than Amazon Web Services because you have to wait for a miner to pick up your offer and then wait for him to run the code and then wait for that block to propogate -- which is not so cool, but it's also the kind of problem you can work around by simply using it for applications where the platform's limitations are acceptable. There are other exceptions as well, but those are two of the important ones.


Good. I'm all for that. But I don't think ethereum forks are really a consensus of the users, because I don't think the overwhelming majority of users are part of the consensus process. And I say that because I don't think most ethereum users have powerful enough computers or fast enough bandwidth to keep up with that blockchain. So they don't get a vote, and can't really afford to get a vote. This doesn't make the platform bad -- just centralized.


I didn't say it was. I think it was an agreement to delete unpopular code, and a proof that ethereum's platform does not run unstoppable code. Which is fine. BTW I think the bad guy's responsibility in the Dao case was to report the bug, not exploit it. I don't think he had a right to exploit it and I think doing so was bad.

The show is not actually about bitcoin, but a fictional currency called Gencoin. This fictional money is Also a digital currency, but it is more centralized because a company controls it (the company is the "startup" in the title and the owners are the protagonists) and the show is largely about them running from the police to protect Gencoin from getting shut down (or even hacked and "stolen" by rivals, if I understand the Season 2 trailers correctly). Bitcoin, of course, doesn't have anyone in charge of it, nor is the code stowed away on a centralized server anywhere (it's open source), so there's no one whose arrest could cause the currency to shut down nor any way to "steal" the code and make it your own personal property. Bitcoin is actually significantly better than Gencoin for these reasons, among others.

A BIP gets tested when a tester creates a fork of the test-btc client and puts the new "upgraded code" in the fork. He then releases that fork and other testers can download it and test it with him to see if it works and look for bugs. There is no voting process; everyone who tests just does it on their own. After enough testing and bug squashing anyone may propose that a bug-tested form of the "upgraded code" is finalized enough for use on the mainnet. They can then create a fork of the actual btc client, put in the new code, and propose it to people for download; propose it to wallet makers for implementation; and propose it to exchanges for implementation there as well. If everyone adopts it, well and good, bitcoin has been upgraded. If some people don't adopt it, that's fine too, they just don't get the new features until they download an upgraded wallet. There is no voting process; people just download the software that want to run, and if a new piece of code has been well-tested and gives us useful new features, wallet makers tend to integrate it into their wallets and make it widely available.
Arguably the most important bitcoin wallet is the one you can download from github, the reference bitcoin client. That's a popular open source wallet with built-in node software -- originally developed by Satoshi himself, though it's been upgraded several times since then. Many other wallet makers copy that code and slightly modify the ui to make it their own, and exchanges and miners tend to use the node software on that site as well. It's maintained by a well-known developer, and when he's done working on the project I'm sure he'll pass on the credentials to some other well-known developer. And if they ever do something funky with the code or put in untested software, there will be an outcry and no one will download it -- rather we'll warn everyone that the GitHub version has been compromised and we'll get a new host.

Nope, no one can stop lightning transactions. If someone tries, you can make a lightning channel directly  with your recipient, and no one can stop you from paying them through that channel. If, however, you merely connect to an intermediary on the network, it is theoretically possible for that intermediary to refuse to route a payment from you. But if they did you could just route around them by making a payment channel to the person you want to pay, and moreover, if you choose to use an intermediary, that intermediary would have a hard time figuring out which payments to route and which not to route, because it is very easy for two parties to make their lightning transactions anonymous and simply not tell the intermediaries which node is the destination node or the source node.

This is a very useful service and should enable easier, faster path-finding on mobile. And, lest anyone think that this compromises lightning's privacy, it doesn't. With any lightning wallet you can create a fresh, unused lightning address, untied to any real-world identity, connect it in "private mode" to any peer on the network, and send payments using it. Other nodes can't see your private node if you don't want them to, or route payments through you, which makes "private mode" very private indeed. Submarine swaps will increase this privacy because you'll be able to use onchain funds to trustlessly pay people to open lightning channels to your node and send you payments through them, all without revealing who you are.

You sign the transaction data with your private key​ but you do not post the private key, just the signed transaction data.

Segwit transactions put less data on the blockchain. This is important for several reasons, one of which is because it lowers transaction fees. Transaction fees are a function of satoshis per byte, and since a byte is a unit of data, if you send less data by using Segwit transactions, each transactions costs less. (4 times less to be exact.) This also helps scalability: since Segwit transactions are 4 times smaller than normal transactions, they allow more transactions to fit into a block, which increases the possible number of transactions per block.
Also: yes, you can distinguish Segwit transactions from normal ones. Segwit transactions are usually about 56 bytes while normal transactions are about 226 bytes. Also, Segwit transactions are sent either from or to an address that begins with the number 3, or the three-letter-combo bc1. Normal transactions are ordinarily sent from -- and go to -- addresses that begin with the number 1. It's a bit more complicated than that, because there are exceptions to all of that, but checking for things such as these in a block explorer can give you a high degree of probability that a transaction was or was not a Segwit transaction.

I can't think of very many reasons why a person might not want to use segwit, but that is no reason to force people to use it.


No, but you don't get lower fees by forcing other people to use segwit. You get lower fees by using segwit yourself -- but if other people use it or not it doesn't affect you.


You can have segwit without forcing people to use it. We already have segwit and we aren't forcing anyone to use it; why not keep doing that? The benefit of not forcing people to use segwit is that the people who want second and third layers can build them, and the people who don't want them don't have to use them. The benefit is freedom. Second and third layer solutions are already here and are built on segwit transactions because anyone can make them. We don't need to force anyone to make them if they don't want to use them. Just let them do their thing and we can do our thing.


First, we can already built those second layers because segwit is already here. We don't need to increase segwit adoption to build second layers. We can do them now, without forcing anyone to change anything. Also, we didn't stay at 1 mb; today there were 107 blocks that were bigger than 1 mb, and only 37 blocks were smaller than 1 mb. The biggest block today was almost 1.5 mb. Segwit included a blocksize increase and now the maximum blocksize is almost 4mb.

The premise of that article is that economic stimulus bills are a good thing, without which we would be in calamity. Many people in this space disagree with that premise. A lot us would like to see the nation's monetary policy removed from the control of the government altogether. Without control over the monetary policy, the government will have severely limited ability to create economic stimulus packages.
One possibility is that the government could collect "rainy day funds" through taxes and use those funds to create any stimulus packages that they feel are necessary. But they would no longer be able to just print money if bitcoin took over the financial sector. So it would limit them -- they could only spend what they collected through taxes, and nothing more.

I've talked to him in the past on here and I'm impressed with his knowledge and passion for privacy and security. We have had at least one disagreement, but I left the conversation impressed and still pondering his arguments. I infer from his high concern for security (and his criticisms of others on that front) that he stores his private keys very safely -- safer than a hurricane could destroy. Safely storing your money involves multiple backups, for one thing. A natural disaster has a chance of destroying one secure location, but it is unlikely to destroy several. A 3-of-5 wallet protects you if someone happens to discover one secret location, but not three. There are ways to prepare for the possibility of natural disasters or thieves, and I think Bitcoin-Yoda has taken the steps to ensure his money is safe.

Segwit was an upgrade to the bitcoin network. When it went through last month, it allowed users to do a new type of transaction (if they want to) which puts less data in the blockchain. Doing this frees up space on the blockchain for more transactions (because the network was getting crowded with the influx of new users) and also lowers transaction fees (because when you send less data, it costs less money to process that data). Segwit transactions are optional, but they do save you money. Smartphone wallets which support Segwit include Greenbits, Greenaddress, and Bitstamp.
Although I will point out: since Segwit went through, transaction fees have dropped significantly (partly due to this upgrade), and it is currently quite easy to send a transaction with a fee of one penny even without using Segwit addresses.

Number 9. Avoid volatility. Merchants can immediately sell any BTCs they receive for the same amount of cash as their product costs at the time of the transaction, and cover the fees for doing so by charging the buyer a little bit extra. This makes volatility a non-issue because the merchant only has bitcoins for a brief moment, a moment when the value of the received bitcoins is equal to the value of the product they are selling.

Not to take away from your fundamental point -- which I agree with -- but in practice there are a couple more steps on the bitcoin side. Namely, you also have to obtain the public key from your 256 bit private key, and hash that public key, and that public key hash has to be in a format that is compatible with the sender of your bitcoins. But still, 3 steps is better than 12, and those 3 are easy to automate -- it's just a button click away.

Each node stores how much money it has received and how much money it sent to the next participant. If they are routing for someone else, they don't know the originator or the ultimate recipient. If Charlie receives payment info from Bob to pass along to Darrell, he doesn't know if Alice sent Bob that payment info or if Bob is the originator, and he doesn't know if Darrell is the ultimate recipient or if Darrell will turn around and pass it along to someone else. Suppose it ends up that Darrell passed it along to Elsa and she gave it to Hans and finally it made it into the hands of Jeckyl, the ultimate recipient. All Jeckyl knows is that he got payment info from Hans that fulfills his payment request -- he doesn't know (at least not from that data) who originally sent it or what the route was. Only the originator of the payment knows that data, because he set up the route. I'm not sure what type of file he stores it in; I assume it's a standard log file.

I think the OP is documenting evidence to support the following theory:
When bitcoin hits a milestone, it tends to drop shortly afterward below that milestone and stay below for several months. It did this at the $1 milestone: it went above $1 briefly, then it went below $1 for about 3 months, then it climbed over $1 again and steadily went up. It did something similar at $10, $100, and $1000, though the time it spent below the milestone varied. If I'm understanding the headline correctly, the author thinks this is due to psychological resistance. When bitcoin hits a milestone, some users mentally can't accept that bitcoin's intrinsic value justifies its ticket price, so they sell. But so far, bitcoin has repeatedly rebounded and climbed higher than the milestone, aiming for a new one, a higher one.

I think the speed depends on how you move it. If you want to send the money via an app, you first need to import the private key of your paper wallet to your favorite bitcoin app. This involves making one transaction: a "send" transaction from your paper wallet to your bitcoin app. That transaction can be 10 minutes or 10 hours depending on what you set your fees at. Then, you can send the money from the app to your recipient and That transaction can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 10 hours (depending on what you set your fees at) and you're done. Be aware that the Segwit upgrade and the Rootstock upgrade are supposed to bring faster transactions in the near future.
Some people have figured out an even faster way to send money from a paper wallet. In the above description, you're just sending money from your paper wallet to your app and then to your recipient. But there is a way to cut out the middle-man: just give your recipient the private key to a paper wallet that contains the amount you want to send him. That's very fast, since it's just a bunch of numbers, and you can send it in an email. Then your recipient can import the private key into his own bitcoin app and get the money on his own time.

This is called arbitration. It is one of several ways that professionals make money on bitcoin. It Tends to even out over time, but it does take time, it doesn't happen instantly. And the exchanges will never all be Exactly even in different countries because at some point the benefit you get from arbitting is outweighed by the costs of transferring money internationally and getting kicked by exchange rate fees every time. Arbitration only works when there's a big enough gap to make it worthwhile, which is not always, but it does happen frequently enough to justify doing it sometimes.

You could buy it for $2250 in America, and sell it for $2800 in Japan, but your $2800 would be in Japanese Yen. To buy in an American exchange again, I think you'd have to get that $2800 in Yen converted into US dollars. That's my current understanding, but I could be wrong. In my head I imagine it would be easier if you had bank accounts in both countries.
Think of it this way: in America, to buy bitcoins without paying a super high fee, you need to register with an exchange. When you do that, you can transfer money from your bank account into the exchange and buy bitcoins with it. But your money is on the exchange -- until you take it out. I assume it's the same in Japan. It's easy to change Yen into bitcoins and vice-versa, but whichever one you do, your money is still on their exchange. So once you sell your bitcoin for $2800 in Yen, how do you get the Yen off the Japanese exchange and into an American exchange in the form of US dollars? I think having international bank accounts would make this easier.

They aren't the same as bitcoin, but they are similar in several ways. They took the technology behind bitcoin and added a few features that bitcoin doesn't have yet. Litecoin added a feature that made it harder for corporations like Bitmain to monopolize the computers that make cryptocurrencies work. Ethereum added a programming framework into the software so that apps can be written into the blockchain and paid for using ether coins. These are important differences, but it is not impossible for bitcoin developers to add these features to bitcoin if they are successful on these other coins, and some developers are laying a foundation to do that in the future in case these features work out well on the smaller coins.

We are early in a period of transition where bitcoin payments are becoming more accepted. Bitflyer and Bitpay are signing up merchants left and right to accept bitcoin payments, along with a few other bitcoin companies who are making the transition happen. 
Things like this don't happen overnight, but, for people who want to pay with bitcoin on a nearly universal level, one option is to get a bitcoin-backed debit card. You can get one from Coinbase, Bitpay, or Mobi, and a few others. They'll issue you a debit card from a major carrier like Visa or Mastercard and let you add a balance to it using bitcoin. You just select how much money you'd like to be on it and they'll charge you the equivalent amount in bitcoin. Then, you can use that card to pay for things anywhere, because debit cards from Visa and Mastercard work internationally. It's an indirect method of paying for stuff with bitcoin, but it does make it easier to live off bitcoin for everyday purchases.

There are several storage options besides storing on a website. The reason people bring this up is because storing on a website has security risks. If the website gets hacked, you can lose your bitcoins, or even if it's not that drastic, you can be stuck with the problems the website has. As an example, Mt. Gox used to be the most popular storage site, but they went bankrupt and millions of people lost their money. 
Today, Coinbase is arguably the most popular storage site, but they put up a banner a few days ago telling people that they are having delays in their software and it may be hard to withdraw your money. Bitfinex is another popular storage site, but they recently said they will no longer let you cash out in dollars. 
Because of this, a lot of people here are advocating offline storage. One way to do this is with a "hardware wallet," abbreviated HW. Trezor is a popular hardware wallet brand and has many features. It is secure, but it also costs up to $100 or more. You get what you pay for.

There is a huge niche for bitcoin to fill there, and if that's all it ever does, it will retain enormous value for that purpose. It doesn't need changed at all to fulfill that purpose.
But most users here and on r/btc want it to be used for small transactions too, and it's beginning to look like we have a path forward through bip148.

It is my understanding that transactions which do not confirm in 72 hours expire. Upon expiration, they return to the wallet of the sender. I might be wrong about the 72 hours... It might be 2 weeks.
As far as I'm aware, there is one possible exception which can temporarily prevent a low-fee transaction from expiring: some bitcoin software "rebroadcasts" a transaction every few minutes until it confirms. If your personal software is doing this, you should be able to turn off rebroadcasting once you realize your fees are too low. Then the transaction should expire within the next 72 hours. (Although I have a sneaking suspicion I got 72 hours mixed up with 2 weeks.)

I, for one, don't quite see how that results in a higher price. As an analogy, suppose I am a trader who only works with chickens and gold coins. The price is, give me 1 gold coin and I'll give you 10 chickens. But then I tell you, you can no longer get chickens. So then somehow the price is 1 gold coin for 30 chickens? How is that possible if I'm not giving out any chickens? How is bitfinex averaging 1 btc for 1950 usd if they aren't giving out any usd?

Mobi and Bitpay offer Bitcoin debit cards if you're willing to let them know your private key. I hope someone is working on a way to let people have a debit card Without giving away your private key -- one that works everywhere, like the ones Mobi and Bitpay offer.
I don't see anything inherently impossible about creating a physical location where you can go to store your bitcoins and/or get loans and other financial services. But I think the general hope among bitcoin believers is to make all this stuff available Without the need for a physical location and Without needing to give people your private key.

When you divide bitcoin infinitesimally, the larger amounts retain their previous value. Permitting smaller denominations just means you can trade the larger amounts in smaller quantities Optionally. So you don't decrease the value of the coin when you do that, whereas with fiat currency, the value of each dollar decreases when you print more of them.

If you hold the private keys and Bitpay does not, then Bitpay can't do anything to your bitcoins. Nothing will happen to them and they'll be safely available on both chains. If Bitpay knows your private keys, then they could possibly send your coins to a wallet on the new blockchain, send you the new private key, and sell the version of your coins that exist on the other chain, while keeping the profits. I doubt they would do that, but it's possible.

The all time low was free. When Bitcoin v. 0.1 was released, there was a "generate bitcoins" button that you could press to get free bitcoins by running a miner on your cpu. People were getting hundreds of free bitcoins per day at the time. But as more people started doing it, difficulty adjusted upward, and soon a home computer could no longer keep up. Mining pools and specialized chips were the next step, and it quickly became apparent that some people wanted to own bitcoins but didn't have the hardware to mine for them, so they just paid for them. Voila! Bitcoins gained real-world value.

Step 1. Click on the "deposit" button. Inside that link, there should be a QR code. That's your bitcoin address, which you can think of as kind of like a bank account number. It's an identifier for where your money is stored on the public bitcoin ledger.
Step 2. Buy bitcoins from a service provider where you can use your preferred payment method. Poloniex isn't for buying bitcoins with dollars, for that you can use one of several services: coinbase, coinmama, bitstamp, a bitcoin ATM, localbitcoins, etc. When you buy bitcoins from one of these services, they will ask you what "address" you want to send your bitcoins to. Show them the QR code from Poloniex and they will send your bitcoins there.
And you're done! Your bitcoins will be available in your Poloniex wallet and you can trade them on the Poloniex service.

I've been musing over the last few days about how a smart contract might be hacked together off-chain which uses bitcoin for payment. I'm quite confident that my idea cannot do All the functions that an on-chain smart contract can do, but if it can do Some of them then that's progress, right?
So here's the background for my idea:
It is possible for automated programs to spend money. It is even possible for automated programs to spend money on bitcoin. For example, tools already exist for making automatic bitcoin purchases from your bank account on a regular basis.
Because programmatic bitcoin purchases are already possible, it seems Very possible to write a program which buys bitcoin using your money ONLY IF a certain number of conditions are met. Conditions which a program can verify.
It is also possible for a program to generate a bitcoin address without showing you the private key, but keeping it encrypted. At least I think you could do that using a true random number generator, for example if you set it to use a seed derived from the tenth decimal place of the current CPU temperature -- which varies every millisecond and is unpredictable.
If you combine these current computer capabilities, I think you could create an open-source program that generates a new bitcoin address and adds bitcoins to it using either your money or a customer's, depending on whether you are buying or selling. It also does not reveal the private key for this address until certain conditions are fulfilled -- conditions specified by the contract. If these conditions are verifiable by a computer, then I think this would be an off-chain smart contract using bitcoin as payment, and could be programmed without introducing new technology.
An example use-case would be an Uber-like ride-sharing program except without Uber being the middle-man who takes fees. A truly peer-to-peer bitcoin-based Uber competitor could be created in the following way:
Create a program that allows customers to pick a destination and set how many bitcoins they are willing to pay a driver to take them there by a certain time. The app should share this ride request with drivers within a certain vacinity. If a driver accepts the ride request, the app should tell the rider to send bitcoins to a new bitcoin address generated by the app. When the rider does so, he no longer controls that money, but neither does the driver -- yet. The app controls it, and will only show the driver the private key when it verifies that the rider's gps is at the specified location before the specified time. Voila! A smart contract. As long as the program is open source, users can check to make sure it doesn't cheat and take fees to give them to someone. It would truly be a peer-to-peer smart contract based on bitcoin.
Am I missing some functionality here? Probably. But it is a limited way to do something useful, for which there is a niche, and I think this idea fulfills enough characteristics of smart contracts to count. If I'm wrong, what am I missing?

Can you give more details? I mean about how you imagine it would work. Obviously you can't swipe a phone... But you can scan stuff. Bitpay has a system that merchants can install to allow you to scan a QR code and pay with bitcoin. A lot of places are accepting Apple Pay and Android Pay, which are similar systems except they use dollars. It would be nice if someone made an app that let you fund your Apple Pay and Android Pay accounts using bitcoin-to-dollars, then you could use Android Pay or Apple Pay and still be using bitcoin indirectly. (Maybe a system like this already exists?)

Just be aware of two things: first, you don't actually store bitcoins on it, you store normal dollars on it that are converted from bitcoin before you use it. Second, you have to do that ahead of time by sending bitcoins to an address associated with your Bitpay card, which means you'll pay fees. This makes it a bit less useful if you're in an area where you don't have internet access. Also, you have to preload it with dollars before you use it, but your dollars get into it by sending bitcoins to the card's bitcoin address. Just be aware of that because it's a pretty clever system, but has its limitations.

I bought half a bitcoin and 3 ether and stored them on bitpay and coinbase. I did this after looking at the growth charts on coinbase and seeing that these two seemed to have the highest recent growth. Both looked exponential and I wanted some of that exponential growth. Etherium has also had a lot of good press and I felt that I was starting to understand its value. A few weeks later I dumped my ether and pumped it into bitcoin, then got my bits out of coinbase/bitpay and into a wallet that I own the keys to.

Not everyone would sell. A very rich person could probably buy an enormous amount -- but at each purchase the price would rise, taking more and more of his money per purchase. At some point, he wouldn't be able to afford any more.
Keep in mind that exchanges have a limited number of bitcoins to sell, until they themselves buy more from other sellers. If a rich guy bought an exchange's whole supply, the price per bitcoin would skyrocket, and some people, seeing the value climb, would refuse to sell to the exchange. To get more, the rich guy would have to try to buy from another exchange, but the prices would be so much higher now he might not be able to afford it.

Owning a whole bitcoin will always be a scarcity. Owning a fraction of one should not be a scarcity, because this is a worldwide currency. 
I'm probably still missing your point because at some level I think this still involves a confusion about the difference between printing money and dividing money. So, operating under the probably-false assumption that this is still what's bothering you, here's another crack: The problem with printing money is not that everybody gets some money -- it's that printing money always lowers the value of each dollar. Dividing bitcoins doesn't lower the value of each bitcoin, it just makes it easier to give people a small amount.
 If I give you a whole dollar, and then you ask for it in four quarters instead, the existence of quarters doesn't devalue the dollar. That's dividing money, and dividing money doesn't devalue money. But if instead of giving you four quarters I get the Federal Reserve to print you four fresh dollars, that devalues everyone's dollar by a tiny amount. That's printing money, and printing money does devalue money.

I think you're not explaining it correctly. My parents recently invested $5000... Right before the bubble popped, actually... And I was the one who persuaded them that it was a good idea. I did show them the growth charts, that was part of it, but I also sat down with them more than once to take questions about what bitcoin is useful for economically and why it matters at the corporate level. It was only after they saw that bitcoin can fill an enormous economic niche, but is also a scarce resource, that they wanted to purchase some. Bitcoin is not just useful for Joe Schmoe to manage his money digitally apart from a bank -- it's also useful for corporations who want to move enormous amounts of money cheaply and quickly. It was after I explained its economic uses that they bought in -- and that's the part you need to explain. Show them the growth charts, yes, but there's a reason those are there, and those reasons are what people need to hear.

They absolutely rake you over the coals in fees. My first time, I paid $145 in fees out of $800 total input... That's like 20%. It was worth it, though, as I have profited. Once you make some money, it gets easier... The fees go down substantially if you buy larger amounts. My father put in $3000 recently, and only paid ~$200 in fees, which is like 7%. Coinbase isn't much better than that if you buy via credit card.
You can give the atm a QR code for whatever address you want. I originally gave it a Bitpay QR code, later I transferred my money to a paper wallet and have used paper wallets ever since, even at the atm.
As for security, they are pretty secure, they don't ask for your private key or anything. You just put in the money and a public key (in the form of a QR code), and it sends the bitcoins to that address. They also give you a receipt and contact info in case anything goes wrong.

Not sure how the old banking system worked actually. I think there was a group called a federal reserver or something like that and they just printed however much money they thought people would want? I know it sounds like a joke from up here in the future, but the old system had unlimited inflation built in, it wasn't secured by mathematics, and it wasn't even encrypted unless you paid someone to encrypt your transaction...and the companies who offered this service charged additional fees on top of ordinary transaction costs... It was very complicated and messy back then. But that's ancient history. Bitcoin is modern money.

Ethereum uses the technology that powers bitcoin to Also power cloud-based computer programs. Part of their idea is to use virtual currency as payment for these programs, as well as for a few other things on the backend. They call their virtual currency ether instead of bitcoin. It's a very good idea and has lots of room to grow. 
On the other hand, bitcoin and ethereum run on the same technology by design, which has the following effect: bitcoin can potentially do everything ethereum does...but without ethereum. A company called Rootstock is preparing a way to integrate ethereum's programming framework into bitcoin using bitcoin as the currency instead of ether, and supposedly it will be backward-compatible, meaning programmers won't need to rewrite their code to put it on Rootstock and start using bitcoin as the payment token. They can just port it as-is. 
If Rootstock delivers on their promises, ethereum might be kind of obsolete. Or Rootstock might not be able to get their software finished in time, and ethereum could leave them in the dust. Or both could thrive a la Apple vs. Android. Even in the worst case scenario for ethereum, there's still money to be made there in the short term.

I think the users you are hearing from are more concerned with the principle of the thing. A lot of bitcoin users have a kind of libertarian streak, and just in principle they don't want people "nosing around in my finances," not even a big corporation who is accountable for their actions. (And not the government, either.) It is quite easy to move your money off an exchange and make your transactions without a corporation spying on you, and these privacy-focused users are just trying to let people know that this is available because, at least in their minds, managing your money with privacy is just obviously better than doing it without privacy.

My paper wallet is stored with people I trust who have home protection and weapons for home defense. I only know the passphrase I used to encrypt the private key, I don't know the actual private key, it's on the paper wallet. As far as I'm aware, you can't decode the private key using the passphrase I used to encrypt it, because you have to type in that passphrase separately after you've gotten ahold of the private key and scanned it. A $5 wrench attack on me wouldn't get enough information to steal my funds, it would only get my encryption passphrase, and you'd need a lot more than a $5 wrench to get to the paper wallet to access the actual private key. So I don't think a $5 wrench attack would work on me.

And software design for it would be absolutely brutal -- programming something useful in Rule 110 would take Much more time than it's worth. It's SOOO slow and has to go through thousands of iterations to perform a single function. It's totally not worth it to program on a Rule 110 machine, it's more of just a fascinating fact that a simple black-and-white pattern can simulate a computer processor.

At which step? I don't think it can be at Step 3, since you'll control the private keys to the new address and won't be selling from that address. And I don't think it can be at Step 4, because when you sell BCCs from that address, there will be no BTCs in it. They'll all be in a new address with a different private key.

Exchanges keep track of their users and have a record of the bitcoin addresses that they assign to each user. Thus, exchanges can track who a person is and how much money they have, and report that to the government.
You can't track who owns some bitcoins Just by looking at the amount it has on the blockchain. But exchanges like Coinbase have more data about their users than just the number of their bitcoin wallet address. They also have your name and, quite often, your bank account number and credit card information. And since they have all that information attached to the wallet address which they assigned to you, they can identify both you and your holdings.

It may be statistically impossible, but statistically impossible simply means there's still a chance.

Some people prefer the convenience of a debit card during the transition to a peer-to-peer system. Relatively few businesses accept bitcoins directly, for the moment anyway, but almost all businesses accept debit cards. If you use bitcoin directly wherever possible, but have a backup debit card funded by converting bitcoins to dollars, you can do that until more businesses accept bitcoins directly. It makes the transition easier while still allowing you to use bitcoins nearly everywhere. It also lines Visa's pockets, but for some people, that seems like a fair trade-off.
Visa may be the horse, but using horses isn't so bad while the roads are still being paved.

It's the Canoe pool. They mined 3 blocks in the last 24 hours and have not yet signaled for Segwit. They have, however, signaled that they are going to do so soon. (They'd better be quick. Non-segwit blocks will get ignored in about 2 hours.) I wonder if they have mined 3 blocks because they just got lucky, or if a bunch of people who Don't want segwit noticed that Canoe is the last significant holdout, and all joined the pool at once, giving it significantly more hash power temporarily. Either way, they'd better upgrade within the next couple of hours if they still want to be relevant.
**EDIT :: Way to go Canoe Pool, they just upgraded and are now Segwit-ready. About just in time, too! Block 477103 is their first Segwit-signalling block.

Thanks, I think I understand now. Some exchanges give you two different btc/usd prices, one for buyers and one for sellers. Buying them is more expensive than selling them because it's currently a bull market. At bitfinex, I guess this difference is just more drastic: 1 btc gets you 0 usd for sellers, but for buyers, you can only get 1 btc if you pay 1950 usd, and that's the listed price on the exchange. Sound about right?

Four counterpoints come to mind:
First, many wallets already translate the satoshi-per-byte fee into a $ amount fee.
Second, the $ amount fee has a caveat: the wallet should tell the user what exchange it is using for this fee, as different exchanges charge different amounts for satoshis at different times, and thus a $ amount fee has the fault of always being "only an estimate, your actual $ amount fee may vary" -- or else wallets would have to compensate for potential fluctuations by overcharging. And built-in overcharging would be very obnoxious to users.
Third, wallets which use $ amount fees still have to translate the dollar amounts into satoshis per byte because the bitcoin protocol doesn't know anything about dollars. Your bitcoin wallet cannot send a miner $0.50 in a literal dollar amount, because there are no dollars and cents on the bitcoin network. Your bitcoin wallet can only send miners an equivalent amount in satoshis. So even if they denominated this in dollars and cents, it would still have to translate that into satoshis per byte on the backend.
Fourth, I think it would be silly to make USD a universal standard in the bitcoin protocol because other countries don't use USD.

You're thinking of BIP148, which doesn't activate until August 1st. BIP91 is a different protocol, which activates a couple of hours from now. BIP91 and BIP148 both ignore non-Segwit blocks. BIP91 was created in part to happen before BIP148 so that August 1st won't be such a big deal.

If you have the private keys to your bitcoin addresses, you'll be fine and you can use the during method: after the split, find two wallets, one that supports one chain and another that supports the other chain. Sweep your private key with both wallets and the coins will be transferred into each in equal amounts. Since they are different chains, one chain won't know what the other is doing.

That's a good question. I don't know about bitcoin apps and I don't want to give a specific recommendation. In my imagination, I group apps together with websites as sharing the same insecurities. For one thing, any app that has your bitcoin password can report back to its website with your bitcoin password. Apps can also get deleted or changed by the app maker through updates. Even if an app is good for now, it may not stay good in the future.
Keep in mind that apps and websites do not actually store your bitcoins on your device or even in their own network. All bitcoins are stored in a public ledger and never leave that public ledger, they only move around between different addresses which are all stored on that public ledger. When we talk about bitcoin storage, we're actually talking about private key storage, where the private key is a kind of password you have to type in in order to transfer bitcoins on the public ledger.
Whether you use a website, an app, a piece of paper, or a Trezor wallet, the biggest and most important service these options provide is to store your password...your private key. Whoever has access to that password has access to your public ledger address (which is basically your account number) and to all your bitcoins. That's why you'll see people warn against using websites and apps to store this information. These websites get hacked all the time, and apps change. If either of those happens, and you don't know what your private key is because you entrusted it to the app or to the website, you can lose all your money.

An upgrade called Segwit gets its first attempt at implementation on August 1st. Upgrades in bitcoin often go through several attempts at implementation before they get adopted by the whole network because the network operators are not actually required to upgrade, they just do it if it is in their financial interest. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get everybody on board. This particular upgrade, the one called Segwit, is expected to make transactions confirm faster and reduce fees. So we're all pretty excited to see if it gets adopted on its first try or if it has to wait a while for the network to adopt it.

I think there are lots of people doing this, but it's moving more slowly than BIP91 adoption for some reason. It was not long ago that BIP141 signalling was around 30%. It seems like the jump to 45% (as of today) has mostly happened after BIP91 was announced. So, while Segwit adoption has moved up more slowly, it has moved up considerably. We only need 6% more to be in the majority.

Miners also process transactions. If I send you ten bits, that transaction has to get put into the ledger, and somebody's got to do that work. Then, somebody's got to make sure all the copies of the ledger around the world get the new entry and record it in the proper place. Miners do all that in addition to unlocking new bitcoins, and they'll continue to do it after all the bitcoins are mined because they are rewarded with transaction fees for their efforts.

Your post is confusing me because my paper wallets have a bunch of numbers and letters listed as the "public key" and all I ever do is send bitcoins to that public key.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't think we're guaranteed to moon just because non-Segwit blocks start getting ignored. I believe Segwit still won't activate until some time in August. What will happen in a couple hours is that all blocks will signal that they are ready for Segwit -- getting the network ready was the point of BIP148 too. Segwit itself is scheduled to activate when 95% of the network signals that it is segwit-ready for a certain space of time, and that space of time takes us well into August. And even after that, getting people to actually use segwit will take a bit longer. As just one example, I currently don't know how to send a Segwit transaction or use the lightning network, and you probably don't either. It will take quite a bit of user-education before this stuff starts getting mainstream usage, but at least now (or in a few hours anyway) the network will be ready for this major upgrade.

Keep your bitcoins in a wallet where you control the private keys. Hardware options include Trezor and Ledger, software options include Mycelium and Electrum. (Personally, I use a paper wallet.) When the BCC split happens, download a BCC wallet. The BCC network will fork off the BTC network on August 1st, and any BTC tokens you have before August 1st (in your control, with your own private keys) will be available on both networks (as BTC tokens on the BTC network, and as BCC tokens on the BCC network). Just send your BTCs to a new address using your BTC wallet, and sell your BCCs using your BCC wallet. Free money! (And no one gets to know your BTC private key. Because you changed it when you sent them to a new address.)

I don't believe there's any chance that the BCC tokens would get sent alongside the BTC tokens because the two networks simply won't look at each other. They have different nodes. If you hit the "send" button in a BTC wallet and direct your money to go to a new wallet, your transaction will be broadcast to a BTC node, not a BCC node. The BCC node won't know anything happened, so you will still have BCC tokens in your "old" address -- and can sell them, no sweat.

The miners aren't blocking Segwit in principle, just BIP148 (I'll get to the difference in a minute). The miners actually have their own plan to implement Segwit through a proposal called Segwit2x. I think it's pretty unanimous among bitcoiners that everyone wants Segwit to happen, there's just different methods for how to implement it.
Segwit is an upgrade to the bitcoin network that will hopefully make transactions faster and cheaper. It increases capacity for more transactions and moves some metadata to another location in order to smooth things up on the network. BIP148 is a controversial protocol which will attempt to upgrade the network and add Segwit without miner cooperation on August 1st. 
BIP148 will also block a hack that some computer manufacturers have built into mining computers. This hack, called Covert Asic Boost, gives certain hardware an advantage, and there's a group of miners that have been abusing this hack to gain additional power over the network. Miners want Segwit, but they don't want BIP148 because it blocks this hidden hack and tries to upgrade the network without their cooperation.
The Lightning network is a sidechain designed to allow thousands of transactions per second. A sidechain can take several forms, but a popular one (and one closely related to the Lightning network) is when a group of people agree to combine all their transactions into one big transaction instead of doing them all separately. This saves time and money because they all just split the cost of one transaction, which takes about 10 minutes, rather than managing a bunch of little transactions over several blocks where each person pays a full transaction fee.
I'm not sure why the Lightning Network has to wait for the Segwit upgrade before it gets going, but it has something to do with centralization. I think the only way to do the Lightning Network currently is to give control of your private keys to a pool of users, which is not exactly fun, but when the Segwit upgrade goes through you won't have to do that? I'm not sure how that works but maybe it has something to do with the way Segwit manages metadata.
The most likely resolution to this drama is that the Segwit upgrade goes through soon. All parties want it -- miners, node operators, and users -- and while there are competing ways to make it happen, everyone is trying to make sure that when Segwit transactions start happening, the network will be ready.

Perhaps someone who knows better will be able to answer better, but off the top of my head I wonder if doing that would reduce the incentive for miners to keep the network in operation. It would be like cutting their pay to one tenth of what it was previously. At that point, would they even be able to pay their overhead? Who would mine if you got paid a tenth of what you get paid today while electricity and hardware costs stay the same? Could anyone even afford to? I'm not sure but I hope someone more knowledgeable will chime in.
What I'm confident of is that these numbers can be fiddled with to varrying degrees, but there is a certain range of effectiveness where if you fiddle with them too much, things start breaking. But there is a certain amount of wiggle room where you can still be effective. Litecoin has faster blocks, I think they are roughly two minutes apart, and they also have a higher number of coins that will eventually be produced. They are doing well, but the value of their coins is obviously a lot less than bitcoin's right now. That can change, but right now it seems like Satoshi had the best plan, we'll see if that's still true in a few years.

A bitcoin wallet doesn't actually hold the blockchain on it, just a copy of your private key and public key. You can think of your public key as an account number for where your bitcoins are stored online, and the private key as a type of password that you need to have in order to spend those bitcoins. The coins themselves are not technically inside the wallet -- they are inside your "account," i.e. your bitcoin address, your public address. And that public address always remains online, so that your coins can't actually be taken offline, they can only be sent to someone else's account. (That's what happens when you "cash out": you're technically just sending your bitcoins to someone else's bitcoin address, either an individual's or a bitcoin company's, and they are sending you dollars in return.)
It doesn't really matter how big the blockchain gets because your private key and your public key are a determined size (very tiny actually) and they don't grow.

You could put it on a paper wallet. You've been able to make them from day one and they work the same way today that they worked then: the "public key" contains the online address where your bitcoins are stored (sort of like an account number on the bitcoin network) and the "private key" serves as a sort of password if you want to transfer your bitcoins to someone else's account.
The public key and the private key are both generated using a basic mathematical algorithm which you can run on your computer or do by hand, and once you have the "account number" (public key) and password (private key) you can transfer bitcoins to the public key and just write down the private key somewhere. Voila! A paper wallet where you can hold your bitcoins for as long as you like.
In the early days I think most people just stored their bitcoins in a wallet generated on the bitcoin core software, which (among other things) created a file on your computer called wallet.dat. I believe this file basically does the same thing as a paper wallet, except it's digital, but that could be where the $27 guy stored his bitcoins too.

No, it's technically a different protocol, but it does include Segwit, which is a good thing. Users here plan to implement Segwit through a controversial protocol called BIP148. There's another group that opposes BIP148 but does want Segwit, and Coinbase is affiliated with that group.
Yes Coinbase wants Segwit, but not necessarily BIP148. BIP148 does implement Segwit, but there are also other ways to do it. I think Coinbase has indicated some support for the Consensus proposal, which implements Segwit Without BIP148 and also increases the block size by an additional 2 megabytes on top of Segwit. Some people here are hopeful that the groups who are pro-Segwit but anti-BIP148 will come around before August 1st arrives, or find some way to accept Segwit through the BIP148 protocol and then work on their 2 MB increase later (or not at all, if Segwit solves the scaling problem).

A lot of people carry their private keys on their phone. I'm not sure if this counts as carrying bitcoin, since your private key is similar to a password, but if I was carrying my private keys with me and they asked me if I was carrying bitcoins I'm not sure what I'd say. Doing it your way seems like a great alternative.
Regarding how they are going to implement this, first, be aware that it is not a law yet, it's still in discussion, so it could change completely before it gets passed. Second, it's probably written the way it currently is because our congressmen have no idea how this works and are just giving it their best guess. They hear people talk about being rich in bitcoins and being able to spend them anywhere, and they just assume you carry them around with you like cash, or they assume you store a digital coin on your phone. But that's not how it works and your bitcoins are never actually on your person -- they just don't realize that yet.
If they pass this bill as it currently stands it won't work because nobody can carry actual bitcoins. If they change the requirement and start asking if you're carrying any private keys, people will just do it your way or something similar so that they don't actually carry anything related to bitcoin over the border. Maybe someday they'll change it to just ask how much money you own in the form of bitcoin. Eventually the government will realize there is no way to track this, and they'll try some other way to stop bad guys than asking them at the border to tell them how much money they have.

I think you're starting to at least brush up against one of the selling points of bitcoin, even if you think the government will find a way to get around it or ban it later, one of the major points is: the "paper trail" (which is electronic in bitcoin's case) doesn't lead to anybody's name. Try as they might, the government simply cannot get your name or your seller's name from the blockchain. It's simply not there. They can audit the company; they won't get your name. They can ban the company from using bitcoin; they can't prove they did. They can demand they pay a tax on their sells; they can't prove they sold anything.
If some companies refuse to use bitcoin or it gets banned, other people (including in other countries) will continue to use it and pick up the slack. You can't ban everyone. There are enough benefits to bitcoin that if the government or some private companies refuse to use it, the ones that don't refuse to use it will prosper -- and end up replacing the ones that refuse. And if/when that happens -- anonymity and untaxability will be the norm.

You took a risk and it paid off. That's not "nothing." It may feel like little, but it's not "nothing." Your investment could have dropped in value -- if that had happened, would you consider that illegal? No, at least I hope not. It is not illegal to invest and then take profits. But you are also not guaranteed to profit. You could invest and lose money -- but if you think bitcoin has good reasons for growing in the future, then it's probably a good idea to invest.

It's an investing term. A bull is someone who thinks a stock price will increase, a bear is someone who thinks it will decrease. A bull trap is something that often happens shortly after a bubble pops. When a stock bubble pops, the stock price starts to go down, which is against the bull's expectations. Often, bulls will buy in shortly after the price starts going down, because they expect it to go up again shortly. And, since they bought in, it does indeed start to go back up briefly.
That's the "bull trap": the bulls spend money during this part, but their investment will shortly be devalued. The bulls think the (temporary) period of going back up is a permanent return to the high "bubble price," but since the bubble just popped there are usually more bears than bulls. The bears sell even during the temporary rise, and new buyers are scarce when there was a recent sudden downturn. The stock price therefore drops again, and the bulls' investment loses value.

There's a controversial upgrade to the bitcoin software that not everyone agrees is a good thing and some network operators are going to try to implement it on August 1st. It could get messy if not everyone is on board. Upgrades to the bitcoin software are always messy for several reasons. For one, on the backend, the software that powers the bitcoin network runs on specialized computer hardware and not all of the owners of this hardware understand it. They just bought it because they could make some money on it and aren't super knowledgeable about the technical stuff.
Also, the people who run bitcoin on the backend are not required to accept upgrades, and they are supposed to assess whether or not an upgrade is a good or bad thing before accepting them. But since a lot of them don't really know computer code or even how to do it, they don't know how to assess an upgrade and many of them just take a "wait and see" approach.
With this particular upgrade, the wait-and-see approach could result in a lot of the backend computers going offline if they don't upgrade. That won't kill the network, because plenty of network operators will already have the upgrade, but it will slow the bitcoin network down for a few weeks while stragglers figure out how to get all their computers back online.
If you want more info, the upgrade is called Segwit and the people who are going to try to implement it on August 1st are using a protocol called BIP148. You can search for those terms if you're interested. I think somewhere around 10% of network operators are ready for the upgrade and the rest aren't on board yet. The percentage of segwit-ready computers on the bitcoin network grows every day, but no one is sure how many bitcoin computers will be ready for it when it activates on August 1st. If it's less than 50% the network will be really messy and slow for a few weeks. 
The worst case scenario is that two separate parties will form -- people who want the upgrade and people who don't -- and if there are enough network operators on both sides they could split the network and block the computers of people on the opposing side. If that happens, the "losing" side will surely start their own network and claim that they are the "real" bitcoin network. That will be very confusing for people if it happens. But even though that sounds bad, be aware that threats like this are always on the horizon and they've never actually broken the bitcoin network. It always comes out just fine. It's just a constant thing people have to deal with when running the software because money is involved and people get very political about money.

Instead of servers, the majority of the Bitcoin Network is on regular computers run by regular people. Some of these computers are called nodes, and others are called miners. When you buy Bitcoins from an exchange or send some using an online wallet, whatever website you are using is connected to a node, and it broadcasts your transaction to the miners. They are the ones who process your transaction, and they are rewarded with Bitcoins and fees. A moment ago I said there are no servers... But nowadays there are some. Since you can get quite a lot of money by being a miner, some people have set up servers just to mine Bitcoins. But there is still a whole lot of the network that is powered by regular people on their regular computers.

Some people on the exchange want to sell, others want to buy. Buy at the lowest price someone is willing to sell at; sell at the highest price someone is willing to buy at. It's the old "buy for $1, sell for $2" routine. Doing this can generate profits faster than holding.
Consider this simple example: you buy 1 bitcoin when the price is $2000. Then you set up a Craigslist ad offering to sell off fractions of your bitcoin for a 10% profit -- meaning if someone wants to buy $200 worth, they'll pay you $220 and you get to pocket the $20 extra. So you sell it to them -- you just sold 0.1 bitcoins and now you have $220. To replace the fraction you just sold, buy $200 worth from an exchange, and now you haven't lost anything, you still have a full bitcoin, but you've also gained $20.
Exchanges do this for a living, except they don't buy from other exchanges (at least not that I'm aware of), they just buy from people who are willing to sell for less than the market price.

A private key is all you need to access someone's bitcoin address and the bitcoins inside it, but a website like Coinbase doesn't tell you the private key to your bitcoin address unless you use their special Vault feature.
Keep in mind that a bitcoin address functions similarly to how a bank account number works in a bank. It is an individual number that the bank can look up to tell you how much money you have in your account. With bitcoin, you don't need the bank to look this up, you can just do it yourself. Also, with a bank account number or a bitcoin address, you can have other people directly deposit money to that account number (or bitcoin address) if you want to get paid for something. 
If you have the private key for someone's bitcoin address, that's like having their password. The private key stores a copy of your bitcoin address along with a password for accessing those funds and sending them to other people. You need your private key to spend bitcoins or to give them away.
A service like Coinbase won't give you the private key unless you use their Vault feature. To make it simpler to use bitcoin, Coinbase holds your bitcoins for you and manages all the technical stuff behind the scenes, while giving you a simple user interface with big buttons for the major things most people want to do, like buying, selling, sending, and receiving. This business model makes it easy to use bitcoin's advanced functions for non-tech-savvy people, but it also carries some risks for users -- all the risks that come with having your money in someone else's hands and not really knowing how it works.
If you store your money on an exchange like Coinbase, your family should be able to access it if you put a copy of your Coinbase username and password in your will. If you store your money on a hardware wallet, your family should be able to access it if you put a copy of your wallet's seed words in your will. If you store your money in a paper wallet, your family should be able to access it if you put a copy of your private key in your will.

ELI5: August 1st is the date when a controversial upgrade gets its first attempt at implementation. Upgrades in bitcoin software can sometimes go through multiple attempts at implementation before they actually get adopted by the whole network, and this one is controversial so it might not happen on the first try. It's supposed to make transactions faster and cheaper, while also blocking a hack that some computer manufacturers have built into bitcoin computers -- a hack that gives these particular computers additional power over the bitcoin network. Some of the people who run these advantaged computers don't want this upgrade because it blocks their advantage, which is why this upgrade is controversial.
If you want more information, the upgrade is called Segwit and it is being implemented using a protocol called BIP148. Google those for more info -- or search this subreddit for an ELI5 about those.

There are several reasons for keeping the blocks 10 minutes apart. One of them involves inflation. Currently, 12.5 new bitcoins are minted whenever a block is confirmed. That means about 1800 new bitcoins appear every day, which is very low inflation compared to the (crashing) US Dollar. But if blocks were mined every minute, inflation would skyrocket, because 12.5 new bitcoins would appear every minute, meaning 18,000 new bitcoins would appear every day. That's about 10 times the current inflation rate, and could drastically reduce the value of everyone's bitcoins at an astonishing rate.

I wonder how feasible it would be to reduce inputs by putting a bunch of utxos in a single wallet and just putting the private key to that wallet in the script of a smaller transaction. Send somebody a 1 satoshi transaction, with its $3 fee, and in the script of it include the private key of a wallet that has a bunch of utxos adding up to an agreed amount. If my understanding is correct, you would only ever have to send somebody a 226 byte transaction through this method but you could include as many utxos as you want. Am I missing something?

Don't keep your private key in your head, keep it in a secure location. When the robber puts the gun to Bill's head, Bill can honestly say, "I have no idea what my cold storage private key is, I've just got some spending money on me worth like $1000."
Also, what's stopping a robber from putting a gun to Bill's head right now and demanding that he wire some USD to the robber's favorite money laundering service? It's probably the same thing that would prevent a robber from demanding that he send bitcoins to the robber's bitcoin address.

The idea of moving the decimal place has been discussed at length with different groups taking different sides. It is still is an option, though I think that's quite a bit different from how stock splits work from a technical perspective. The most popular "smaller" names for bitcoin are millibitcoins, bits, and satoshis. One millibitcoin is currently worth about $2.50, one bit is worth about $0.0025, and five hundred satoshis are currently worth about $0.01. There are price trackers that use millibitcoin instead of bitcoin to track prices -- see  for an example. Some people think it is easier to comprehend if the decimal doesn't have a bunch of zeros nearby.

My favorite option right now is a paper wallet (free except for the price of a piece of printer paper). To spend from it easily, I use the "cold storage spending" option from the Mycelium app. (Also free.) I just scan my private key, type the amount I went to spend, and scan the wallet I'm sending to. One advantage is that Mycelium immediately forgets what private key you scanned from so that remains secure.
A disadvantage of this option is that I'm reusing a bitcoin address, which makes me more trackable. Based on my current knowledge I don't think that'll be a problem unless I'm a millionaire someday, and in that case I'll just get a Ledger.

Segwit is an upgrade to the software that powers the bitcoin network. Among other things, the Segwit upgrade is supposed to make transactions faster and cheaper like they used to be by increasing capacity and moving some metadata into a separate location so that more space on the network is freed up for transactions. The first attempt to implement this upgrade will happen on August 1st. In bitcoin, upgrades don't always happen quickly or smoothly. The network runs on open-source software, and network operators are not required to accept upgrades. Many network operators take a wait-and-see approach, which makes upgrades go through several attempts before they actually get adopted by the whole network.
BIP148 is a controversial protocol which implements Segwit and also blocks something called Covert Asic Boost, which is a hack that some computer manufacturers have built into some bitcoin computers to give them a hidden advantage on the network. A group of miners based mainly in China (I think) have been abusing Covert Asic Boost to gather more power over the bitcoin network, and BIP148 will hopefully foil their plan -- if it gets adopted.
Keep in mind that upgrading bitcoin takes time and can't be expected to happen instantly. It was only quite recently that the fees began to get out of control, and it's reasonable to wait a few months while the network gets upgraded. I'm the meantime, bitcoin is still useful for storing value as an alternative to gold, and for sending large amounts of money quicker and cheaper than Western Union, and its network is useful for storing data because it has never gone down for a single millisecond in eight years. That's all very valuable, and hopefully bitcoin will be useful for small transactions again when the Segwit upgrade goes through. Check back on August 1st to see if the first attempt was successful.
I hope that helps. Please let me know.

You can create an external address for bitcoin using several different services. My personal favorite is bitaddress.org. Bitaddress.org will provide you with a random external address known to you alone, along with a private key you can use to spend any bitcoins stored at that address. Think of the bitcoin address like it's a bank account number and the private key like it's a password. 
You can share your address number with other people if you want, and it can be good to do so if you want people to send money to you at that address. But don't share the private key with people. If someone has your private key and your bitcoin address, they can steal your money, just like people can steal your money if they have your bank account number and your password.
To send money to an external bitcoin address, create one at bitaddress.org (or a similar service), and it will give you two numbers: the public address and the private key. Copy the public key number and tell Coinbase to send the money there. To access that money later, keep the private key somewhere safe and make a backup copy of it in case the original gets damaged. Bitcoin wallets like Bitpay and Copay allow you to "sweep" a private key by scanning it with your phone's camera, which will then import your money into the app to spend it.

In one way it's deregulated but in another way it is Very regulated: by the software. As just one example, a big part of monetary policy and regulation is, Who sets the inflation rate? Bitcoin has a software-set inflation rate until 2140, at which time inflation ceases. That particular regulation is in the code. And since bitcoin is open source, anyone who can read and understand coding languages can read the code and discover the regulations.

Thanks. It gets more amazing if you check the math further. Today's computers are able to perform thousands of calculations per second. If quantum computers get developed and are able to do the things quantum fanboys dream about (which is not guaranteed to happen -- for one thing, it's super expensive to run a computer at near-absolute-zero), they'll be able to do arbitrarily high numbers of computations -- millions upon millions or more -- not per second, but rather simultaneously, instantaneously, with no lag. So some people think that's a problem.
But let's take it a step further, to the very limits of what is possible by the laws of thermodynamics: if you had a perfectly efficient machine, able to take the smallest possible amount of energy, the Planck limit, and use that energy to turn a one into a zero (i.e. to count), a computer like that -- a perfectly efficient one with no flaws -- could at its highest potential barely even *count* to 100 quindecillion. And you know how much energy it would require to do that? The entire energy output of the sun, not just for a day or for a year, but over its entire lifetime. That's just to *count* to 100 quindecillion, let alone to check the value of each address at that level. So if you have your money in a bitcoin address, it's pretty safe even from the most efficient computers possible.

The second part of your post is very correct. Bitcoin will not be used for things like paying for gas and other everyday purchases until the transaction fees get lower. Segwit helps lower transaction fees and will get its first attempt at implementation on August 1st.
The first part of your post is only partly correct. The $50 bln market cap is not based on the assumption that bitcoin will soon be useful for small transactions, or any way not that assumption alone. Bitcoin's current value is based on its current features: it is cheaper and faster - for large transactions - than either a bank or Western Union; it has extremely reliable network management which people can tap into to store files of any size permanently and securely without the costs that come with managing a centralized database; it is an alternative to gold; it lets you make anonymous transactions; and it gives you the ability to manage your money online without a bank or a government getting involved. Those features are part of bitcoin right now (even without Segwit) and are worth more than $50 bln. The Segwit upgrade doesn't affect those features, it merely gives bitcoin Additional value by making it useful for small transactions again.

I bought in when bitcoin was $1355 and my coins have retained that value or grown higher ever since. So far, they've been quite predictably useful, and they've retained their purchasing power. If you break it down into smaller units, you might notice that 1 millibitcoin hasn't retained its power to purchase two egg cartons, but keep in mind that, for some of us, 1 mbtc only recently Got that purchasing power. 
When I bought in, 1 mbtc was able to purchase 1 egg carton, and it still is, only now you get more change back. It has retained its purchasing power and grown. It bitcoin is looked at from that perspective, it's a great store of value. I sure am glad I stored my value in it, because my value has only grown ever since.

But I'm not ready to discard the theory that the developers of bitcoin sort of invested it with -- that bitcoin (and similar technologies) can be used to create decentralized companies who leave no paper trails, inventory trails, or transaction histories, but who can sell things for less than their centralized, non-anonymous competitors.

No problem. Personally, I don't mind the zeros, but I understand the value of eliminating them for non-mathematical people. 0.0034 btc just "seems" like hardly anything to some people, even if it's technically the same as 3.40 mbtc. We do this with meters and millimeters; feel free to do it with bitcoins and millibitcoins. That's one of the nice things about bitcoin: you actually don't need to do anything in code to switch from btc to mbtc. Just start saying millibitcoins instead of bitcoins, and when you write an amount, move the decimal and write mbtc instead of btc. Just as we do not need to physically split a yardstick in order to measure in inches, we do not need to split anything in bitcoin in order to buy or sell in millibitcoins.

Bitcoin inputs are the smaller amounts of bitcoin that have been sent to your wallet. Together, they add up to your total amount. To explain a little better, let me give an example: one time I bought 1.1 bitcoins for my parents using a bitcoin ATM. The ATM sent this amount to my parents's wallet in three separate inputs, smaller amounts of bitcoin that together added up to 1.1. Since the ATM sent their money in 3 parts, they had to pay 3 times the usual transaction fee. The good news is that these inputs were sent all at once to the same address, which means they got consolidated once they entered their wallet. As a result, it won't cost three times the usual transaction fee to send them somewhere else in the future, it will only cost the ordinary transaction fee.
If your current balance of bitcoins entered your wallet in staggered amounts in 60 different purchases, you will have 60 inputs and it will cost 60 times the typical transaction fee to send them somewhere else. This is one reason why it's not worth it to collect individual satoshis from a bitcoin faucet. Even if you get a full bitcoin eventually from collecting satoshis out of a bitcoin faucet, there will be thousands of inputs that make up that bitcoin, and you'll have to pay extra in transaction fees for each input if you want to spend that money. The costs outweigh the benefits.
BTW I'm pretty new at this and I may have some errors in my explanation. More experienced people can clarify if I've made a mistake.

I use a free Bitpay wallet as a spending account and store my savings on a paper wallet. If I need to add more money to my spending account, I can sweep the paper wallet into the Bitpay wallet, keep a bit on there for spending, and send the rest to a new paper wallet. It's secure, mostly free (transaction fees excepted), and since I have a Bitpay debit card, I can also spend my bitcoins virtually anywhere by this method.
I'm thinking about switching to a Coinbase wallet for everyday spending because the Coinbase debit card has more features than the Bitpay debit card. Among them, I like that the Coinbase card lets you keep your money as bitcoins until the time of purchase, whereas Bitpay makes you preload your card with US dollars by sending bitcoins to the card's public address in advance (whereupon they are converted into US dollars -- which only shrink in value).

Putting all 30 btc on a single paper wallet would cost one transaction fee. Depending on how many inputs there are, that could cost $2.50 (if there's one input) or more (if there's more than one input). Putting 30 btc on 30 paper wallets would cost 30 transaction fees. That's about $2.50 times 30, and more if there's more than 1 input on some of your coins. (BTW $2.50 times 30 is $75.)

Can I ask a few questions about  In my imagination, a software wallet can be lost through device failure. If that happens, the only way to recover it is with a backup phrase. This backup phrase is typically stored on paper somewhere. Is all that correct? And if so, isn't it just as easy to lose that backup phrase as it is to lose a paper wallet? So how is it "easier to not lose your private keys"? It seems to me that storing a backup phrase on paper is just as secure from loss as storing a wallet on paper. What am I missing?

Yes, encrypting your private keys is another way to prevent people from auctioning them off. Of course, then you have to remember your encryption passphrase or password, and, at least in my mind, storing that passphrase has the same problems and solutions as storing your private key. You can save a copy digitally, print it off and hide it, and/or try to remember it -- just like your seed words. But encrypting your private keys with an additional passphrase is definitely an additional layer of security, which is a nice thing to have.

The rules governing purchases by minors are set by each company that sells bitcoins, and different ones have different rules. As a parent, you can set your own rules about what to do with bitcoins you purchase, you are not required to keep bitcoins away from a minor just because a given company has a private policy against selling them more than a certain amount.
If your child has a bitcoin account number, you can send as many bitcoins to him as you want (assuming you can afford them). If your child doesn't have a bitcoin account number yet, there are free services to create them, or you can download a bitcoin wallet app. I hope that helps, please let me know.

It is my understanding that you will be perfectly fine using your Bitpay debit card after Segwit goes through. Bitpay won't reject Segwit-compatible transactions, they just aren't going to require them. (And if Segwit gets implemented through Segwit2x, Bitpay may even reject Non-segwit transactions -- which would sure be quite a turn-around!) I'm not sure if it's a good idea to keep your coins in that wallet during the switch, my instinct tells me it will be fine because their wallet gives you control of the private key, but I'm quite confident that your debit card won't change at all after Segwit except it might cost less transaction fees to put money on it.

Thank you both for this dialogue, I do have a question about training employees. If I have Suzie running the cash register and Jim comes in and wants to pay in bitcoin, how is Suzie going to know how to check it? It seems to me that, if all you do is hang up a QR code for the wallet you want people to send money to, Suzie will have to do a few things to make sure the payment goes through. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Suzie will have to look up the receiving address on the blockchain before the transaction, check the current price of bitcoin, convert that to the amount needed for the current transaction (Jim needs to send me $6 in bitcoins... Let's see, that's... 0.002922 bitcoins), tell Jim to send that amount to the receiving address, then check the blockchain to see that it was sent, then maybe ask him to wait a few minutes for some transaction confirmations.
Won't it quite a bit of training to teach Suzie to do all that? Or am I missing something?

Because no one's name is on the blockchain. Bitcoins are stored in addresses that function sort of like a bank account numbers, except they are anonymous. You can create your own bitcoin addresses without giving anybody your name or any identifying info and have a completely anonymous account number. If you create several of them, you can transfer your coins among them and then no one can know who they belong to. Did you send them to yourself or to someone else? No one knows because the account numbers are all anonymous.
I'm sure you know that Satoshi Nakamoto is the founder of bitcoin. Well, we can use the blockchain to find out what his first bitcoin address was, because it is the one with the earliest transaction history. I've never looked it up, but it probably doesn't have very many bitcoins in it, if any at all, because Satoshi probably created new bitcoin addresses once his invention had enough users and sent his coins to these new addresses, and then sent them along to new ones again and again until his funds were very diversified into many different addresses. We can't know which ones are his because we don't know which coins he was spending and/or giving to other people and which coins he was just transferring into his own anonymous addresses. All the addresses are anonymous -- so, other than the first one, how can we know which ones are his and which ones belong to other people from whom he bought something or gave coins to?

One of the nice things about bitcoin is that some things don't actually require any coding. Moving the decimal place is one example. Some price trackers already tell you the price in millibitcoins, which is largely what you are describing. See bitcoinity.org/markets for an example. Instead of pricing bitcoins at $2,867 per bitcoin, you'll see it's $2.87 per millibitcoin. There are also wallets that let you tech your coins in millibitcoins instead of in the larger form. If you prefer this decimalisation, that's fine, just use services that list the currency in this form. Computers, of course, don't care where the decimal is, so it won't affect the mempool, which is run by computers.

Has anybody written up an easy how-to for splitting your coins after the chain splits? The first idea that comes to my mind is to create a new public key and send your coins to it using a fee that is too low for miners on the legacy chain but acceptable to miners on the Segwit chain. The transaction should get confirmed on the Segwit chain, meaning you'll have all your coins in a new address on the Segwit chain. But on the legacy chain the transaction should time out after three days and the coins should revert to your old address on the legacy chain, which would mean you have zero coins in the new address and all your coins in the old address on the legacy chain. Is that the right way to split them? Am I missing an easier way?

We don't know, but be aware that, often, after a sharp rise, there is a temporary fall. Today I read two interesting articles that discussed this phenomenon. If you suppose there will be a temporary fall, which is pretty typical, you don't know when it will be and what it will drop to. It might climb for quite a while before the drop, and if that happens, it might drop to a place that is Still above the current price.
Related to that, if you really believe in bitcoin's fundamental ideas, it hardly matters if you buy at $2520 versus $2660. If the price is going somewhere between $5000 and $10000 this year, and higher next year, the amount you save will be very small compared to the amount you gain. It's not worth it to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller.

I will let him know that Mycelium is an option and show him how to use it. I am confident he will choose to do so because it will let him store his money on his phone and mycelium also has cool features that a paper wallet doesn't have. However, I've pushed him toward a paper wallet because I personally think it's safer than a software wallet (for example, I believe phones can be remotely wiped if bitcoin gets banned), and I think there's got to be a way to let a wallet "watch" a public address while not giving it the private address until you're ready to sweep. I tried to do this in Mycelium, and while I can scan the public key with it, it doesn't apparently show the value in the scanned address -- it just offers me buttons for sharing the address with others. Am I missing something?

Under the current system, they need your address. But with the blockchain it is possible to anonymize all that. Make a decentralized app on the ethereum network (or Rootstock) that stores a hash of a pickup address -- something impossible for anyone to use to find out who you are, but which you can safely give to companies who accept bitcoin. This address is encrypted -- not even the company you give it to knows what the address it is, only you and the app. The app finds anonymous shippers (paid in bitcoin, replacing Fedex) who will take your product to your pickup location. Only you and the most recent anonymous shipper know where that location is because only you have the private key to the location and the anonymous shipper just happened to be the one who delivered it there. Voila! Without giving anybody your address, you got your product. And, at every stage, the government has no one to tax -- it's all anonymous. There is no record of a sale -- no record of a pickup -- no record of a dropoff -- no one to track -- no one to go to to hold a gun up to their head and say, "Who paid you??" It's all anonymous.

It's also arguably pseudonymous rather than anonymous, depending on how you think you are related to your coins's public addresses. If you think of yourself as the owner of those addresses, then you could argue that the public address serves as an identifier for you. People want to send money to You, and you give them a number that serves that purpose. That would make the public address function on the blockchain as a pseudonym for you.
Public addresses remind me more of bank account numbers than wallets do. Wallets remind me of banks themselves rather than bank account numbers. Like a bank, a good wallet allows you to create more than one "account number," i.e. public address.

If bitcoin becomes worth $10,000 and you have 0.5 bitcoins, your coins will be worth $5,000. Just multiply the amount you have by the amount you want it to be worth. 10000 times 0.5 = 5000.

The founder of bitcoin was the only miner for a while and as a result people suppose he has about 1 million bitcoins. "Half" was an exaggeration, but with that amount of coins he could possibly crash the network for a while by cashing out. If 1/16th of the total supply got sold all at once, it would likely cause a huge panic and the value of bitcoin would plunge. Presumably he won't do that to his own invention, and if he does cash out at all it probably won't be all at once but little by little. (I imagine the inventor doesn't view his invention as an opportunity to grab U.S. dollars anyway, though. He's probably among the many developers who think bitcoin will replace the U.S. dollar and other forms of government-issued money, so why would he cash out for a form of money that he probably thinks will soon be part of the ash-heap of history?)

If people start hearing more reports of frozen funds, it will incentive them to use cold wallets. As one example, Mycelium makes it easy to spend money stored on a paper wallet.

There are several ways to do a successful five minute pitch. One way involves a "three points" method, which is probably familiar if you ever wrote an essay in high school. Don't tell everything there is to say -- tell three main things.
I use an approach based on the three points method. Point one: you can manage your money online without a bank. Why is that a benefit? For one, because banks have higher fees. You can manage your money online with a Chase account, sure. But with Bitcoin, if you try to spend more than you have, there are no overdraft fees, the transaction simply doesn't go through. If you deposit $10,000 in one day, nobody files a report on you. If you want to leave all your money to your grandchild, or want to send it to a family member's amount, there is no tax on that. It's better without a bank.
Point two: Bitcoin is useful for large companies who need to move large amounts of money quickly and cheaply. With Western Union or PayPal, sending $100,000 to your shipping associate in Amsterdam can cost hundreds of dollars, and take several days to go through, especially since the money needs to be converted from US dollars to the other country's currency. With Bitcoin, it's about $2.50, and it gets approved in about an hour, and you don't need to call the currency exchange service and pay them for anything. That's a huge benefit for big companies, something that fills an enormous niche that they really need, and since it fills this role, you can Bet its usage will grow enormously even if this reason alone was all we had.
Point three: limited supply. If you buy one now while a low income person can still afford one, and hold on to it, and if bitcoin takes over the economy, you will guaranteed be one of the 21 million richest people in the world. You will guaranteed be in the top 1%. And even if it Doesn't take over the economy, but just a portion of it, your investment will be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. You'll be in the top 10%. Only if bitcoin fails will you be out your $2500, but if it succeeds... You'll be in for upwards of $100,000.
Then, show them the charts. Show them that it's doubled 12 times in 8 years and if it does that 6 more times each bitcoin will be worth $1 million. Show them that it's out-performed every other currency by miles. Show them the videos of well-known investors and tech gurus who say this is the real deal and will change the world. You have your reasons, you have your motivation... Try it out.

There are about 100 quindecillion possible private keys. The number of currently-in-use private keys is about 14 million. So, first, divide 100 quindecillion by 14 million, and your chances of stumbling on someone else's private key by accident on your first try are 1 over that number. (1 in millions of trillions.) Your second attempt would give you a chance of 2 in millions of trillions, then 3 in millions of trillions, and so on.
I hope my math checks out. In short, even if you built an app that checks a million private keys per millisecond, there are so few addresses in use relative to the possible number of addresses that it would likely take more than the lifetime of the universe to randomly find one that is currently in use.

Many people on this subreddit expect the price to drop shortly before August 1st. That is the date when a controversial upgrade gets its first attempt at implementation. Upgrades in bitcoin software can sometimes go through multiple attempts at implementation before they actually get adopted, and this one is controversial so it might not happen on the first try.

I believe they auction off the wallet.dat files, or any other file that contains private keys. Bitcoin addresses are encrypted, but the decryptor is in the private key. So if you get that, you get somebody's bitcoins. You can get the private keys from a wallet.dat file, or check to see if they saved the private key in a text file, or find a person's paper wallets, which each have a private key printed on them. Then, you can auction those off, if you want to. One way to prevent this from happening is to use a brain wallet and just memorize your seed words, not storing your private key anywhere but in your mind (in the form of seed words).

He's not exactly joking, except perhaps for the last phrase about upgrading your node. Most of us here probably don't have nodes, because only network operators run them.
The Segwit upgrade was scheduled to get its first attempt at implementation on August 1st, and upgrades in bitcoin can get pretty messy so there was a lot of chatter about it. But it looks like the upgrade will go pretty smoothly recently and some network operators are even thinking of running the upgrade sooner, which should help make August 1st less of a huge change.
