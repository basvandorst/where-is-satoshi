I would recommend keeping the majority of your coins on a printed paper wallet.  keep spending money in a smartphone wallet app.

One account can have multiple bitcoin wallets, allowing you to hold multiple bitcoin balances. That might account for it.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:20:17
If you are planning on keeping a large amount of bitcoin, you should really look into paper wallets or buying a hardware wallet.
If you are in the US, then coinbase or circle is a good source to buy bitcoin.  you can even use them as a website wallet.  Bitcoins kept with them are insured.
But my favorite wallet app for average daily use is mycelium.

Maybe you want to use a feature that is not in the mainchain and maybe the community doesn't feel like its safe incorporating that certain feature into the mainchain (it might be risky bc it might destabilize the mainchain).  
So to get the best of both worlds, just keep the "risky" features in the sidechain.  If something goes wrong, only that one sidechain is affected, **mainchain stays 100% safe.**

@_date: 2015-06-15 22:04:55
not doing this to "grill you", but it seems you might have misunderstands:


That is what miners do currently, they verify the transactions.  So nothing different there.


They are awarded new bitcoin and fees (not new addresses, anyone can go make as many addresses they want)


Yes, but it is entirely possible for the total of all the fees to add up to "whole" bitcoins.


Yes, that is how it is now actually, most bitcoin transactions do have fees, and it is expected that there will be more transactions 50 years from now, so they will be making their money on the fees instead of new bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:18:36
No problem! The basic idea is that as time goes by and the mining reward decreases, the number of transactions pick up (each with a fee), which continues to provide an incentive long after the last bitcoin is mined.  If blocks get full, it very well could drive the fee per transaction up - which is why there is a lot of interest in developing systems like sidechains and lightning network, which would mean the transactions would be performed faster and cheaper while still tying back to the main bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:24:46
If a sidechain has good features, it doesn't necessarily mean that those features have to be incorporated into the mainchain - You can just hop b/w mainchain and sidechain as needed.
Even if Blythe makes a certain sidechain that is privately controlled (not sure if this is possible), it still adds value to bitcoin (because it would mean they would be using bitcoin).

At a basic level, every type of bitcoin wallet has a private key and public address.  instead of managing those with an app on computer or phone, you can just print them out on paper so that it **only exists on paper**, which can eliminate the possibility of your coins being hacked. I use this site for printing paper wallets:

everyone can see all addresses which have held / do hold coins - blockchain.info can associate all of it with your email, yes.  I would suggest using a different wallet that you control if you don't want your email associated with your bitcoin activity.

I'm not sure if those are similar issues.  Using government money when we now have alternatives (granted, it might be 5 - 20 years before bitcoin is usable by the average joe), is giving legitimacy to the system.  If we know how these currencies are created, we should make efforts to stop supporting those systems, otherwise, **we are giving it power to keep going**.  If we stopped using US dollars, the less power it will have, meaning less power is given to the system of riba.  Using riba based money is agreeing to the method by which they are created.
and here's another important aspect - in order for the government to pay back the debt and associated interest, the central banks create more money at a faster rate (they have to, because when x money gets created, 1.06x has to be paid back) - in other words, inflation is baked into the currency.  **Inflation steals purchasing power from everyone holding the currency**, which helps pay back the interest of the older money created.  so again, when we hold these government currencies, we are subject to the inflation of the currencies, which is used to pay back the interest of when money gets created.  **So just by holding these currencies, we are being forced to pay the interest (riba) thru inflation**.  all screams haram when we analyze fiat money more closely. it's no wonder that islamic money has traditionally always been gold/silver, you can't inflate those to collect interest payments.
Edit: riba works both ways.  it is haram (forbidden) to receive as well as give riba.

Usually, each bitcoin 'account' is a made up of a public address and the funds can only be spent with the one corresponding private key.  With Multi-sig however, it is a way of setting up a special account where more than one private key is needed to spent funds - for example, you might need 3 out of 5 private keys to spent from that account.  Here is a good video about multi-sig:

Can you send your money to a friend or merchant in africa or china instantly and without paying 5-15% in fees?  You can't because of all the middlemen involved in that transaction.  When I send bitcoin, transactions are sent instantly straight from me to the recipient. no middleman, no crazy fees.  This is HUGE for people in third world countries who loose alot of money to fees when money is sent to them from family and friends.  Basically, you have much more freedom to do what you want with your money with bitcoin.  want to send money to wikileaks? paypal and credit cards won't let you, they can freeze transactions they don't like.  With bitcoin, no problem, bitcoin is sent instantly, can't be stopped.  see watch, i can send you money instantly:
+0.003 BTC verify
Also consider how this will help regular businesses.  This article goes more in depth on how fees are eliminated for merchants:  
There are also political reasons why a person would want to adopt bitcoin.  There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.  so if you hate how countries easily debase their currency thru inflation, bitcoin looks very attractive, especially in countries with failing currencies.  and since bitcoin is a currency that has no central authority and no single point of failure, it has huge appeal to people who hate government, bankers, and central banks.  
tl;dr - Bitcoin is a complete revolution in money.

@_date: 2014-09-05 19:05:37
If we assume the number of transactions will go up, why can't the fee stay the same as it is now (~5cents)?  If we assume that there will be 50x the number of transactions, then miners will make 50x as much in miner's fees, without the need for the fee per transaction to go up.  I guess it will come down to having an efficient way of including more transactions in a block.  Am I missing something?

Muslim here,
Maybe talk about why muslims should be using bitcoin over fiat money:
Also, it seems 99.9% of all transactions in saudi are done in cash. Maybe use the analogy of how bitcoin is cash for the internet, useable without any middlemen. Maybe also talk about how potentially useful bitcoin is for international remittances.
Feel free to bounce ideas off me. Introducing bitcoin to the middle east is something I'm very interested in.

Muslim here, I wrote about bitcoins a year ago: 
I would say the major reason why Muslims should adopt bitcoin is because all fiat currency (even in "Islamic" countries) is pegged to USD*, which is a system that is based on debt and interest - since dollars can't be created without debt, and that debt has to be paid back with interest.  So if a Muslim is using govt backed money, they are using a system based on interest.

For now, yes credit cards are needed for instant buys. But even without credit cards you can just load up at the beginning of the month on bitcoin and you are good to go.

I think it helps to look at it like the internet.  When nerds first started using the internet, everyone asked the same question you are asking now: "why should i care?"
The nerds would say:
-you can send an electronic message to anyone using the internet
-you can read and learn about anything online
-you can set up a site to write your own opinions for everyone to read with no one to stop you
Most everyone else who wasn't using the internet would reply with:
-writing on paper and sending a letter in the mail works just fine for me, plus, other people I know don't use the internet.  Plus, I can always just use a fax machine.
-I can go read and learn about anything at the public library
-I can just send my opinion to the opinion column of the local newspaper and hopefully they will publish it
This is where we are now with bitcoin.  It's hard for many people to see why bitcoin is important when their current banking *appears to be working just fine*.  
Bitcoin allows you to have total freedom and control of your money, just like the internet allows you to have total freedom and control of your communications.  Because of this, bitcoin will have just as big of an impact on the world as the internet did, if not much bigger - and this is why you should care.

Muslim here.  What it comes down to is this:  Government money like the US dollar is created as a debt by the federal reserve, a debt which must be paid back **with interest** by the american people.  This would mean that the method by which dollars are created is based on usury (riba).  So the theory is, how the hell can dollars be considered halal to use?  And using middle eastern currencies doesn't improve the situation because arab countries like to tie the value of their currencies to the dollar.  so using the dollar or riyal should be considered haram to use.  Problem is, this issue doesn't get discussed much at all! and it is so baffling to me!  if muslims knew a currency was made of pig skin, would they use it? i don't think so.  so why are we being hypocritical when it comes to a currency based on riba?  
Bitcoin is very much like gold and silver, that is, they are not based on debt and riba.

Miners show proof of work and this proof of work is very easy to verify. The rest of the network sees this and agrees that since the miner has valid proof of work, they get a ledger entry showing 25 new bitcoins going to the miner.  Here is one example (look at the first transaction):

freedom to receive money from anywhere in the world easily, freedom to send money anywhere in the world easily, protection from fiat currency inflation, evade sanctions and capital controls, no need to ask permission to do what you want with bitcoin, no risk of a bank confiscating your bitcoins.
You seem hung up on the "digits created magically by computers" - you should realize most money in banks is nothing more than just digits on a bank ledger because banks practice fractional reserve banking.  It is no problem for a country's central bank to just print money.  At least the digits in bitcoin can't be fractionally reserve (unless you choose to give them up to a bank) and bitcoins are capped at 21 million.  But bitcoin still has some ways to go before it can be used as a good everyday currency.

I don't agree with how Jan classifies bitcoin mining as gambling (which would mean mining goes against sharia rules).  Bitcoin mining, similar to Gold mining (which isn't a problem in sharia), is the same way.  You can spend money on mining hardware (whether it be for gold mining or bitcoin mining), consume energy (man power or electricity), and you might come up empty handed after mining all day.  It doesn't mean that this falls into gambling by Islamic standards.

currently, about 3600 bitcoins are created everyday.  in 2-3 years, 1800 btc will be created everyday.  4 years after that, only 900 btc will be created everyday.  4 years after that 450 btc will be created everyday. this keeps happening every 4 years until there is a total of 21 million coins.
So the question is, would you rather buy it now, when there is a higher creation rate, or buy later, when there is a lower creation rate?  It would be smarter to buy now because the current high creation rate puts pressure on keeping the price low VS later, when a lower creation rate will drive prices up.
tl;dr:  inflationary creation of btc now - cheaper prices now.  Deflationary later - higher prices later.  So if you want cheap coins, buy now.

today's wars all seem orchestrated by a select few people in high places - especially corrupt leaders in governments. Currency is one of the main ways that governments are able to fund wars.  It is trivial for a government to steal purchasing power from everyone, especially the poor, by inflation.  Bitcoin allows us to avoid being stolen from to fund killing of civilians.  Bitcoin allows people to take power back into their own hands.  If you don't want to fund the killing of people all over the world, start adopting bitcoin, and make government currency worthless.

Ok, here's something that is easy to disprove - He said: "so far in 6 years there's not one worth while use case for bitcoin"
Normally, when people want to send money to and from third world countries, they normally have to use western union or moneygram and they get charged 8-15% for sending money ( So if someone only had $300 dollars to send to their family overseas, they will see $40 get taken in fees instead of going to feeding their family back home. So in a 500 billion dollar remittance market, 50 billion goes to the greedy bastards running western union and moneygram because people didn't have an alternative - until now. With bitcoin, it suddenly becomes MUCH easier and much cheaper to send money overseas. Instead of a 8-15% fee, it can be 1-3%.
 
That is a worthwhile use case (unless you believe that poor people deserve to have less of their own money).

Your welcome! After you learn more about crypto you start to realize that just because something is cheap doesn't necessarily mean you should buy it.

Here is an example of how to very easily fake a very large market cap. Create a "Newcoin" that has, say, 1 Billion coins. Set aside ONLY 100 Newcoins, keep the rest for yourself/company/"investors". Convince a few people who know nothing about economics to buy those 100 available newcoins at $1/newcoin. As long as a few people who know nothing about economics keep thinking the price should be at least $1/newcoin, you have just created a "newcoin" market cap of 1 billion dollars. As you can see, it only took $100 of buying power to establish a market cap of 1 billion Dollars. If you convince your followers to buy those 100 newcoins at $5 a piece, you create a newcoin market cap that is bigger than bitcoin. My example isn't that different from Paycoin - 97% of paycoins don't touch the market because they are held by some guy, his company, and mysterious "investors".

If they try that, I'll simply stick with the rest of the world and keep using "true bitcoin" and simply ignore the IRS fork, or rather, "IRScoin" (it isn't like they can block my transactions either - I can just send them hidden inside twitter or skype messages, I'll disguise them as innocent looking smileys).  They aren't going to be able to convince all the bitcoin users worldwide to upgrade to their "new and improved" version.  The IRS fork with a minority of users and miners will be very insecure since most mining happens outside the US.
The thing about decentralized systems is that there is really is no feasible way of controlling/co-opting them.  Watching them try to do so will be funnier than watching the govt try and prevent the blue prints for 3d printed guns from being shared (bittorrent is decentralized as well) - they can't control it.  They can't even prevent the secret files of govt employees from being in the hands of some chinese hackers.
Here's another way to look at how futile an IRS fork will be:  if the IRS says, "ok, all gold coins and silver has to be stored with the IRS from now on" - are you really going to follow that mandate and hand in all your precious metal? would people from russia, india, and china follow that mandate?
Again, the govt co-opting bitcoin isn't the thing to be worried about.  the outright banning of bitcoin is the real concern.  If they outlaw bitcoin and you are holding some, you'll see their value drop quickly by a whole lot.

they can run as many nodes as they want, that won't change anything.  Even if 80% of all nodes are run by banks, all we have to do is connect to the 20% that are not run by banks, or better yet, just run your own node, then there is no relying on the other nodes.
Now with mining, they have to play by the same consensus rules as everyone else.  If they start mining with their own rules (such as more than 21 million btc), then they will make their own fork of the blockchain that no one else will want to be using.  It really is no different than them creating their own coin (which, btw, they are doing:   People that want NWO coin will start with something like Citicoin, not bitcoin.
Bitcoin is an entire ecosystem.  In addition to nodes and miners, there are exchanges, payment processors, merchants, customers, all of which are distributed globally, not just in the US.  Any changes have to basically be approved by the ecosystem at all these levels, not just at the bitcoin protocol level.
What is much more likely to happen is them outlawing bitcoin - that is the greater concern.  But all that will likely do is just push bitcoin underground.

there's really nothing out there that supports the claim of "bitcoin is the currency of the new world order".  There is no central bank, there is no central point of control, mining and transactions are transparent, code is 100% open source for anyone to look at, and it is a completely voluntary system.
But if risky speculation on bitcoin price interests you, you can buy, say, $10 to $20 dollars of bitcoin every week or so until you have 1 bitcoin.  having 1 bitcoin will always equal 1/21,000,000 of the total bitcoin supply.

well the people that make that implication are flat out wrong because divisibility doesn't affect the finite-ness of bitcoin.  for example, if you start off with 5 pizzas you can choose to cut each one into 10 pieces or 1000 extremely small pieces - it doesn't matter because you still ONLY have 5 pizzas **no matter how you cut it.**  cutting a pizza or bitcoin into smaller and smaller fractions doesn't increase the supply at all.

The way I see it: 
bitcoin - blockchain that is scalable in a decentralized manner
ripple - blockchain that is scalable in a centralized manner (the main "trusted" nodes for ripple are controlled by ripple labs)
eris - tools that enable use of new blockchains on small scales only (can't scale up in a trustless manner)
I think the main controversy these days is.. can the latter two types of "blockchains" really be considered "true" blockchains.  Some would say that a blockchain MUST always be decentralized and trustless.

~~I suspect that is why a fixed amount of ethers get created every single year, to try and keep prices affordable.~~  But it is worth noting that each ether is much more highly divisible than a bitcoin.
Edit: I just realized that I'm mistaken - the cost of executing contracts is dependent on gas price, not ether price.  having it priced in terms of "gas" ensures that contracts stay cheap to execute.

Since you are new, using coinbase is a good way to get started while you learn more about bitcoin.  Coinbase lets you buy and sell bitcoin using your bank account, and then stores your bitcoin on the coinbase wallet - but you are free to send your coins to another wallet that you set up on your phone or computer (you can make as many wallets as you want).

each 1 bitcoin can be broken down into 100,000,000 satoshi (kinda like how a dollar can be broken down into 100 cents).  In other words 0.00000001 bitcoin = 1 satoshi.  People did this as a way to "tip their hats" to satoshi, as a small way of acknowledging him for his work.  about 1-2 years ago, people decided that it would be helpful to have a middle ground, and have 100 satoshi = 1 bit , or 0.000001 bitcoin = 1 bit.  So if you have a million bits, you have 1 bitcoin.

The bitcoin mining algorithm is an "artificial" problem designed so that bitcoin can be self regulating. So it doesn't solve any biology or physics problems, but that is actually a very good thing to ensure that bitcoin works securely - let me explain: let's say for example, bitcoin mining was made to work toward a biology solution of folding proteins that supposedly no one figured out yet. What might happen is that it turns out someone else already figured out the solution using a different method that was more computationally efficient than bitcoin, or maybe they used a method that did not rely on computer power - a more powerful microscope was used perhaps. What can happen now is that the other solution that was solved can be used to attack the entire bitcoin network and undermine the security behind bitcoin. Does that make sense? The other solution that was found without bitcoin mining undermines all the "proof of work" needed to secure bitcoin.

I'm going to assume you understand how a regular paper wallet works.  Basically if someone steals your regular paper wallet, they have your bitcoins.
With BIP 0038, you can make a paper wallet, except the private key is encrypted using a password.  So if someone steals your BIP 0038 paper wallet, they cannot steal your bitcoins unless you give them the password to decrypt the private key.
Feel free to ask if you have questions.  I'll do my best to answer.

Depends on the number of people using bitcoin.  For the amount of people using bitcoin **right now**, I think it is over-valued.  However, bitcoin can solve so many problems around the world. lets look at the remittance industry for example - the fees associated with remittance are around 10% per transaction.  I believe that if/when bitcoin is used instead, the fees can come down to 1% or less.  The remittance industry is a 500 billion dollar industry.  If bitcoin (currently 2 billion dollars) moves to replace the remittance industry, then the price should jump to $40,000 per bitcoin (currently $165/bitcoin).

The supply of bitcoin is set so that there is a steady creation of new bitcoin.  This process tapers off over many decades resulting in a set limit of bitcoin (21million).  The price per bitcoin is set by exchanges, such as [bitstamp]( - people are always trading fiat money for bitcoin at these exchanges.  So if demand for bitcoin is up, so is the price.  If demand is low, so is the price.  Kinda like how stocks work.


Everything that happens on the bitcoin network is 100% transparent:  transactions, mining power, total bitcoins created.  A good place to see all of these things is  
So since everything that happens on the bitcoin network is transparent to everyone else, it really isn't possible for someone else to be pulling strings without the rest of the network noticing.

I'm sure there are other methods, but the one I use is bitaddress.org. Just click the "wallet details" tab, and put in the BIP38 private key - it will recognize the format and then ask for the password - then it will reveal the true private key. Then you can take the private key into blockchain.info or multibit to access the funds.
I recommend testing all this with a very small amount of bitcoin. Once you feel confident enough that it works, then you can start moving larger amounts of your coins into a BIP38 paper wallet.
