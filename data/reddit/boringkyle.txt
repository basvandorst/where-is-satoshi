Nope. Not possible, at least not without someone dying. If any single person has root access to the server the site is on, it can be changed.

PLEASE LET CANADIANS USE YOUR FUCKING SHIT ROBINHOOD

Sure. Lets say all major ISPs in the US contact GDAX and say, pay us or we'll stop allowing our customers to go to your site. Wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be funny if it was from the guy(s) who hacked NiceHash?

+50% in 8 days. You tell me what else gets you those kinds of returns and can be hidden so you don't have to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:58:01
0.050 now :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:22:42
Sell high, buy low.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:36:25
1 mil
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:58:03
Soon to be 16k. This is insane. Will it even crash...
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:07:22
Yeah. That's what happens when people make the decision to elect corrupt politicians.

Whatever $40 was worth of BTC 2 days ago.

There's 1k fluctuations. My exchange is 0.5% fees. I'm not being greedy with my profits and only looking for 0.0005 to 0.001 btc gains.

You withdraw it to your chequeing account and then pay your bill like a responsible adult.

When this BTC push is done, if it ever finishes, ETH will likely go up some, so yes trading BTC for ETH right now may be a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:28:43
This is pretty basic math dude.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:01:48
No. He can't sell them all at ~15k. Even if he could, 1 mil btc at ~15k is 15 billion. Gates is worth 86 billion. He's likely top 20, but definitely not first.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:26:44
Well I turned 0.048 into 0.049 today, so... yes?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:28:12
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:24:08
Probably that ~15k to ~19k swing.
@_date: 2016-05-19 06:58:50
I doubt they will. The US government will make sure of that.
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:48:47
I think it would depend on the laws where you live, and where your servers are located.
