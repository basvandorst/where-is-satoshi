Maybe I used the word bill incorrectly, I meant Democrats are the ones that are causing the shutdown. 
The rest of my post should be fine, where I did say that Trump repealed DACA and the democrats are playing hardball by not agreeing on the budget.

Coinbase is a simple interface to buy and sell (if you're in USA). 
GDAX is more of a trading platform which allows you to put market/limit buy sell orders and might not be something most average joes will use as it's a bit more complicated. It's like most other exchanges- like Bittrex, Binance, etc. but most people who are just getting into cryptos find Coinbase the easiest to get in as you can just link a credit card and buy your 1st little bit without the confusion and stress that comes with dealing with an exchange.

The canadian exchange QuadrigaCX has BS wire requirements minimum of $100,000. Basically everyone's fucked there!

I bought the dip today. It went down more after I bought it, so I bought more!
Told my friends to buy because some of them just won't get in because it's too high. I told them if u were ever getting into crypto, today's a good day to start, everything's at a discount! They said no! 
So I bought more again! :)
HODL baby!

Actually, this time it's the Democrats that are refusing to pass the bill. Just like others, I'm not really educated on US Politics (I'm Canadian) but I did a lot of reading to try to understand why this is happening.
From my understanding, Obama has protected the Dreamers (undocumented people) who would not have to leave the country even though they have no status there and were on their way to becoming citizens under DACA. 
Then Trump became president and repealed it and now I believe at some point DACA Dreamers will have to leave the country. I'm a little unclear on this part and when/if they will be deported. 
So democrats want Trump to back off DACA and of course he's not, so they are using that as leverage to not agree on the budget and cause a government shutdown...
Now, this could be a completely misunderstood analysis of what's going on or there could be many other factors or holes that I'm missing, but this seemed to make sense in my head and from the random articles I read on CNN.

A few months ago, I had what I thought a very meaningful and intelligent conversation with an older guy I work with for 15 minutes about Bitcoin and how it's catching on and going to the moon. This guy isn't very intelligent when it comes to what we do at work, but I was impressed that he was also into Bitcoin.
Then he said he had a chance to buy one bitcoin from the local pawn shop and maybe they still have it sitting on the shelf and he'll stop by after work to pick it up. That's when I decided to walk away from the conversation.
That's your average joe!

A tech support analyst for the Jax Jaguars, with 3 first names, in a group for Indians in Australia. Hmm, doesn't sound fishy at all! Haha

Yes, it reminds of me the article where I read someone made millions selling Chuck e cheese coins to people in NYC. He was eventually arrested but that's crazy.

Yes, you can move it out of CB and to whatever exchange you choose or your own wallet even. But, don't make the mistake I made the 1st time I did that. CB and GDAX are run by the same folks, but GDAX allows you to send without fees (they pay it) whereas CB charges you a fee to send it anywhere. Since you're halfway verified, just go to gdax, use your same login and complete the additional verification and send your coins for no fees from GDAX. Theres's no minimum either, so every time I buy something on CB now, I just use GDAX to transfer it to my ledger nano s.

If any Chinese miners want to move to Canada, I live in a part of Canada where winters are long, cold as fuck (-50C) for like 6-7+ months of the year. Get in touch with me and we can get something going here!

Thanks for correcting me. That's one thing I wasn't sure about. Not sure if it was eventually a path to citizenship or just a permanent status of being undocumented.

They could have sold at $2700 and made a killing! But what do I know, I bought at 1500 and watched it soar to 2700 and didn't sell, thinking it will go higher, only to see it start crashing. I eventually sold it closer to 1600 so all that stress for nothing!
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:55:47
So true. I am a prime example of this. I thought I can sell at 7600 after I bought at 5500 and make a nice profit, because there will be a dip and I'll buy at a lower price. That didn't happen. Ended up re-buying around 7900 and then when the BCH pump and dump happened, I decided to sell to buy some BCH. Lost money doing that and in the mean time BTC went up a significant amount. I've bought back in again at around 9200 now and definitely own less than what I had before. I'm officially out of the 21mil club. Bummer but you live and learn I guess. Now it's just HODL!

I'm thinking of building an e-commerce website to sell some electronics to build my crypto inventory! This will help speed that up hopefully! I like wordpress and woocommerce so hopefully it all integrates well!

I am new to BTC so please bear with me. I bought my 1st little bit before the split and I read that coinbase didn't give me BCC equivalent. They are doing it in January now, so does that mean I have to leave my BTC there to get the equivalent? Or the fact that I bought it there is enough? I've currently moved it over and around a few places for trading!

Haha, so true. Although the afternoon games are looking better. Let's go Watson and Miller. Need the TDs for my fantasy team.

So the expectation is that Starbucks (or similar) will have to accept IOUs till the end of the month to make it worth either parties?
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:14:58


I don't even know what that means lmao!
I guess I'll wait till January. The real question is, that while I will get it in January, I don't have to leave it in Coinbase till January, is that right? Nothing is in Coinbase currently. But the way I understand it, come january, I will have a little bit of BCH I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:30:24
any reason what's causing the surge all of a sudden?
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:00:23
How bout those afternoon games? My boy Watson and Miller killed it. And then I picked up Juju off waivers last night and boy it was as good as watching by BTC go up over 6200 lmao

Super newbie here. I own 1 BTC. It's mostly on a canadian exchange- Quadriga and some is sitting in Bittrex. Should I leave it with those exchanges, and when they decide to implement the 2x, I will get both coins? If it's sitting in my own wallet, would I benefit from the split?
As comments have mentioned, it's already confusing for sort of newbies, I can only imagine the layman getting into bitcoin after the split. It's going to be a total mess.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:20:35
Yeah not gonna hold my breath. I guess Coinbase fucked up at that split. They should have just said oh, you bought x BTC from us, and so here's x BCH for you. Enjoy!
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:21:22
Should I sell my ETH to BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:53:36
So even though I didn't necessarily purchase my BTC from Bittrex, I just moved it thre from purchasing from Coinbase or Quadriga, Bittrex will double it for it? 
I also don't know what a ledger is. Is it just as the name says? A ledger with my keys stored, or are you referring to the ledger nano s, the hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:18:32
Makes more sense when you say it's sort of like escrow! I'd be onboard with that!...

Haha, I'm playing against Elliot. FML too
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:35:34
If I'm holding my coins in a hardware wallet, will I get the equal number of coins from the exchange once the 2x split happens? Or is that only for people who leave their coins in Coinbase at the time of the split?
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:57:19
Man I never thought I was stupid, but then I got into crypto currencies, and I feel so lost most of the time. I thought I was just supposed to buy and hodl!
So going back to the BTC/BCH split... I was super new into buying BTC at that time and I did use coinbase. Now, I have no idea if I got BCH or how to go about getting it. Can you please point me in the right direction? I might be missing out on that action!

Spam him. Set up a auto-send to send it 4-5 times a day, from multiple emails until he responds. Send him random payments in bitcoin addresses, making it look like he's taking bribes. Eventually he's gonna have to respond! ;)
