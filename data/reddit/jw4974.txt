Let's not ruin the party.
There really are people here who thinks BTC is going to take over fiat and be worth over $1m each when that happens.
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:45:46
Isn't decentralisation a "feature"?
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:17:41
Hello?  Anyone here?
@_date: 2018-09-08 06:31:42
Nope.  Cost goes down, hash goes up, complexity adjust up.
Just for everyone's interest - 
Current breakeven is apparently $5,376
@_date: 2018-09-20 01:31:41
Nope.  
Tether is used for almost half of all BTC trades on a daily basis.  Other stable coins are nowhere near this.
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:22:58
A reserve currency is used by governments as a contingency for trade in case it's own currency is in trouble.
Since BTC has totally failed to be adopted by merchants, the prospect of it being accepted for international trade is laughable.
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:49:38
Yes.  And that's because most merchants don't accept BTC.
Point is - the world has gone way passed in making fiat useable ... while BTC is still struggling to facilitate simple payments.
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:16:42
Seems like either I'm clueless or you are in denial of the obvious.
BTC and cryptos have gone past the hype cycle and now declining to being irrelevant.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:42:46
Lol .... it's so easy to get under your skin.  That's not the behaviour of someone who's up 3,000%.
Nope - you are behaving more like someone who's deep in the red (bought at $15k?) and trying so hard in here 24x7 to convince yourself that you made the right decision :)
@_date: 2018-09-29 17:26:19
Sure.  But maybe you should just wait a while more.
There's no stimulus to break out of this price band so sooner or later, the price is going to go down further (unless something interesting happens).
@_date: 2018-09-30 02:02:04
Let's be specific since you have been doing nothing but spewing crap.
So tell us what exactly is the "vision"?
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:30:42
You are full of shit and I'm calling this one.
If you truly have been here for last 6 years, you would be up over 3,000%.  In which case, you won't be here everyday moaning about a -5% drop when it happened and attacking everyone who even suggest anything negative about it's price.
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:16:54
Given that it's not widely accepted as a currency, this "math based trust" clearly isn't working.
@_date: 2018-09-29 10:27:29
10 years?
Given the declining interest, BTC is more likely to be relegated to the likes of DVDs and MP3 players within the next 2-3 years.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:16:39
I didn't short in the 7's.  I shorted since it was 17.
And I have said it for months already - it's going to go parallel between 6-8 for a long, long time until something breaks - like the Tether scam.
@_date: 2018-09-30 04:21:53
If it is to happen, it will be gradual and over a long period of time.  Long enough for anyone to see it coming.
In the meantime, it's going nowhere but down using any measurement.
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:10:15
Current number:
A - 5, B - 9, C - 1

@_date: 2018-09-22 11:15:51
Gold?  Lmfao!  You actually comparing a digital token with Gold??
Dude, Gold is so well established as a store of value that governments actually hoard them as national reserves!  Why?  Because when there's a confidence crisis in their currency, Gold can then be used for trade.
You been watching too much youtubes.
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:20:18
Well, every "future claim" you have made is going in opposite direction so of course it's crap.
In case you haven't realised by now, crypto is already a passing fad and interest is waning.
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:39:31
The standard response for crypto's failures - "it will succeed sometime in the future".  In the meantime, it's going down.
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:44:22
Unless there's some major trigger, my take is that it will just hover between 6-8 for a long time.
Its a good place for scalping actually.  That's how the exchanges and traders are making good money while the hodlers wait for their moon.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:32:40
Yes, it's suicidal at this stage to short.  
The upside is just not worth the risk.
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:03:42
A basic requirement for any asset to be a store of value is acceptance for goods and services.
Right now, the only place where BTC has value is on exchanges and adoption by merchants is almost non-existence.  So I don't see why it would come anywhere close to being a good store of value.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:46:23
Unless there's an earth shattering event, yes - bottom is around 6.
Above 8, we need new capital and that's only going to come with some trigger that leads to a snowball effect (FOMO!).  Not sure what this trigger might be.
But without a trigger, it's going to stagnate between 6-8.
@_date: 2018-09-30 02:03:23
Then it has failed.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:38:23
Dude, you have been going around making personal attacks when you offer no better than shitposts yourself.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:10:45
Dude, a lot of people including myself have been riding shorts for months.  So it's not much of a 'dare'.  
Fact is, the only people making money are the exchanges, whales riding the volatility they created, pre-2017 buyers and short sellers.
Everyone else are just losers contributing to the above.
@_date: 2018-09-02 09:13:20
Just curious about the overlap of Trump supporters and BTC supporters.  Which one of you are (a) Pro Trump and Pro BTC, (b) Anti Trump and Pro BTC, (c) Pro BTC, don't care about Trump?
Anti BTC need not respond.
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:21:30
It's no different from CBOE in that it's both about taking a position on a future price.
Since so many have complained that BTC's prices were manipulated to close near CBOE's closings, why would you think it won't happen to Bakkt?
@_date: 2018-09-29 17:25:42
Sure.  But maybe you should just wait a while more.
There's no stimulus to break out of this price band so sooner or later, the price is going to go down further (unless something interesting happens).

Tired of all these conspiracy nut cases.
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:01:41
"so many large organizations biting at each others"?  Sure :)
Couple of months ago, some level of interest.  Now, nobody even talks about it anymore.  
@_date: 2018-09-29 06:31:24
Lol .... repeating crap everyday won't make it more real :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:09:59
That's the problem with conspiracy nut cases like you - you make up stories, claim them as facts and challenge everyone else to prove you wrong.
That's not the way the world works.  If you want to state a point, the onus of proof is on you.  So, go ahead and prove every statement made.
@_date: 2018-09-29 06:30:09
And BTC is backed by .... ?
@_date: 2018-09-30 11:54:57
They said the same thing before CME futures went online.
@_date: 2018-09-30 02:12:29
Is that your best?  What a joke.
@_date: 2018-09-29 17:06:26
It's now just a cottage industry and this is the hangout.  But that's all it is now.
Most of the people here are just hoping for a price bump to cut their losses and get out.
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:17:43
The only short I took was coming off the ATH and it's simply a hedge for the coins I had.  
Prior to that, I used it to buy plenty of stuff and just happened to have a pretty healthy balance when it went off the chart.  Neither me nor any of my friends even tracked or cared much about the price beyond the usual conversion back to fiat when we buy stuff.
So my viewpoint is that it was useful, not a big game changer as only anonymous sellers insisted on being paid with it.  And certainly not what I consider to be an investment vehicle.
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:12:38
It isn't nonsense because that is precisely what is happening.
But go ahead and believe whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-09-29 10:30:02
Yeap.  Like DVDs, Kodak instant cameras, dial up modems .....
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:33:00
Friendly advice - Just hodl.  
Don't be tempted to DCA on a downtrend by "buying every dip".  This is how a lot of people lose more than their pants.
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:46:13
The point I'm making is that if BTC isn't even adopted for the simplest of trade, its chance of being an alternative money system is zero.
I just find it utter nonsense when BTC advocates talk about grandiose ideas of replacing gold, replacing fiat, etc when its not even accepted in the coffee shops.
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:22:04
There are plenty of people who have not sold because they are underwater.  That's basically almost everyone who bought after Dec.
@_date: 2018-09-30 11:49:50
I can buy $1000 of gold and be rest assured that 10 years from now, it will retain it's value within acceptable limits, and if needed, cash it out for plenty of coffee.
No one can say the same for BTC.  You can buy $1000 of BTC and it may become worthless in 10 years as superior tech replaces it.  Heck, it can't even retain 50% of its value in less than 6 months.
The scarcity argument holds no water unless there is utility value that is irreplaceable.  That is not true for BTC or for that matter, any crypto since there are plenty of alts that have superior tech that can perform the same job.
You obviously have no experience dealing with large transactions.  If you do, then you would understand that payment is just one element of contracts.
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:30:32
There you go again ...... "most people's jaw would drop".
None of us including you have any clue on this and yet you are willing to make a wild claim just to make BTC look a little better.
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:19:37
It's just a reflection of a loss of public interest in cryptos.
The hype is gone and this is either going to go into slow decline or a sudden crash before the decline.
@_date: 2018-09-30 03:39:01
... and it died.  
No public interest = No merchant = Little value as currency

Lol ....
I'm sitting on a pretty sizeable short :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:05:48
Well, given that adoption has actually declined and there's not much that can be bought with BTC .....

@_date: 2018-09-30 14:33:40
No doubt.  It is true that the impact is not well understood (even futures after so many cycles).
But it does not negate the fact that the impact might turn out to have a negative price impact, just like futures.
So be careful what you wish for.

Dude, I didn't say it's going to zero.  All I said was that it has failed to be adopted by merchants.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:36:08
False equivalence.
Gold is held by governments as national reserves to back their currencies.  I.e., it's accepted for the purpose of trade between nations.  Cryptos are not.

Why bother to use TA when we all know the price is manipulated?

This is not good .... entire crypto market is collapsing.
Wonder what's the trigger.
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:28:56
No, it will be rejected for the same reasons why the previous ETFs were rejected.
And no insurance company will accept liability on the basis of asset impairment due to price manipulation unless it can be proven.

Now we know who's responsible.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:43:26
How much $ did you put into this?
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:12:34
I can say that it's just a digital token which is artificially limited to 21m and that will be 100% accurate.  
But it does not mean that it's a currency nor gives it any value.  
When it's legal tender in a country, then it's considered to be a currency in that country.  When merchants accept it in exchange for goods and services, then it's a useful currency.  Again, neither are true for BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:37:16

No - it's always in the 'investors relationship' section.

BTC will replace all fiats.  And since there's about 90T of money in the world, each BTC will be worth .... $4.3m each!  Moon and Lambos!!
Oh ... I forgot to add:  ETFs! Futures! Institutional $!  (Have I missed out anything?)
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:06:01
Alright.  Let's say:
a.   Transactions are 90% fake and therefore, they do not make as much fee as you think.  
b.  Tethers are sold at a huge discount, say 10 cents on the dollar.  With the understanding that it's not redeemable.  Tethers can then be used to buy other coins, which are then cashed out on other exchanges.
c.  To keep the momentum, the price of BTC needs to be sustained (at say 6k).  When the price starts to go below that, more Tethers are printed for the sole purpose of wash trading and pumping up BTC.  In the wash trading process, the newly printed Tethers are dissipated into the market.
Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:14:33
Well, there's no ETF so it's a moot point.
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:34:23
No reason ... it's a feature of BTC :)
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:33:54

@_date: 2018-08-06 08:41:24
Well, a lot of people here have lost a lot of money so they do need some emotional support.
But of course, there are morons running around claiming that it's the bottom and encouraging others to buy.
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:18:18
It's the original poster who got it confused.
Decentralised mining protects BTC.  But when 81% is centralised in China, then it's not that secure anymore.
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:45:36
Oh please.
The only people making real money in the last 6 months are short sellers.
@_date: 2018-08-19 07:01:21
Fully agree.  
I'm just waiting for the clamp down on manipulations, Tethers, etc.  This will result in a total reset of prices and we can focus on real use cases instead of price.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:24:16
He's one of the reason why the public in general has a negative perception of cryptos.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:43:25
Lol ... convenient and I'm lazy.
@_date: 2018-08-18 04:13:41
We have not seen the bottom yet.
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:44:13
Well, the more likely case is that the majority of the people here already lost money, are desperate and trying to convince new suckers to buy in the slim hope that it will lead to price increase.
Aren't you one of them?  Coming here screaming of untold wealth from ETFs and futures even when none of them have been approved?

Why would SEC approve the CBOE ETF when their concerns about price manipulation have not been addressed?
When over 90% of trades are carried out on shady Chinese exchanges outside of SEC's control, I very much doubt if they will grant an ETF.

To be candid, it's not the seasoned hodlers that are generating all the noise.  
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:19:06
Dude, price went up?  It's a hair above the 6-month low.  
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:24:52
It's just a marketing gimmick.
Just like Microsoft and Steam, they will soon abandon it for the same reasons.
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:26:47
BTC's price determines the ETF's price, not the other way round.  And to be frank, I don't really give much of a hoot about current prices since it's a nonsense number.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:35:17
Yeap.  
But it's good to know that cryptos aren't immune to the larger market sentiments.

He's actually factually correct on most of his points and he has not even made any speculative points.
So what is your problem?
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:37:37
The onus in on Bitfinex to prove, by means of a CPA audit, that their claim is true.  This is not a matter for the public to 'expose' and neither is it a theory.  
It is a FACT that they claimed to have 1-1 backing and it is also a FACT that they have failed to provide audited evidence.
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:39:03
There's no conspiracy or FUD.
It's quite obvious that it's a bear market, price is and will go down and there is no reason for the price to go up.  The fact that it has been going horizontal between 6-8 by itself is a miracle (or manipulation).
The only reason why it has not gone down faster and lower is that Tethers are being printed to pump up the price every now and then.  
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:20:26
Believe it or not, there are morons running around who believes that Tether is legit and they are entitled to "print" more Tethers to ensure that the Tether = $1 exchange is maintained .... because there is increased demand for Tether.
Incredible logic.
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:53:49
They are printing as much Tethers as needed to prop up the price.
Don't worry.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:09:51

a.  People who bought at lower price and now wants to take profit off the table.
b.  Short sellers.
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:55:39
Well, if you have a good reason to think this is going to break out of the 6-8 boundary, then sure.
But as it stands, there is no reason to believe that.  It's more likely to start tapering downwards than up.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:37:05
Everyone is a pretty strong word.
I didn't when it was 20k and I won't when it's 8k.

There is no change in market cap for these cash ETFs.
For every $1 in ETFs issued, it must be backed by $1 in BTCs held by the ETF issuer.  For every 1% price change in BTC, the same 1% will be reflected in the ETF price.  
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:11:14

If you believe that's fud, then you really are a moron.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:53:56
Now you are learning something.
Yes - Tether is being used to wash trade and pump up BTC's price.  
That's why whenever BTC's price starts dropping, Bitfinex "print" more Tethers to use for this purpose.  You think the extra Tethers being printed every time BTC's price goes down is a coincident?
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:43:45
Lol ... No, it's not showing that.
@_date: 2018-08-14 10:46:15
That's because it's a religion with blind faith.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:50:52
Settlement happens in back office, nothing to do with their customers.
As for transaction fees, 0% risk means customer pays.  But we won't know till it's rolled out.  Maybe Starbucks will just absorb it like they do for credit cards.

How about I tell you I have both a long and a short hedge?
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:06:18
Yes.  
And there are plenty of morons here who thinks that building an ETF on top of this crap is a good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:38:13
It will bounce between 6-8 for a long time.  So if you want to have funds stuck here, go ahead and buy a bag.
@_date: 2018-08-26 08:49:59
You are obviously in denial.
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:09:47
Why the gloating?  It's not as if BTC is doing well.
@_date: 2018-08-06 07:26:48
ROFL!   
Let me get this right .... people who own stocks are going to sell their stocks on Monday because they heard of a possible ETF last Friday that might or might not happen sometime in the future?
Sorry, this is really hilarious :)
Let me give you a clue - people with serious money in stocks are the least likely to invest in cryptos.
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:25:47
Other than rhetorics and wishful thinking, there really isn't any reason for the price to increase.
In fact, the price would have crashed if not for the Tether pumps.
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:14:06
There is no basis to support the claim that the worst case is break even.
It may go all the way down to 2017 start price of $1k for all we know.
@_date: 2018-08-07 05:37:18
Agree.  That's why I haven't done anything with my stash for years.
Well, it was nice to see a big figure during ATH and on hindsight, maybe I should have sold lol :)
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:10:32
Come on ... you, of all people, get emotional over a couple of hundred drop?
You can hardly even see it on the month view.
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:49:11
You need to learn to analyse facts rather than cling on only to views that are aligned to your own worldview.
So tell me, do great products drive demand or channels of access?
@_date: 2018-08-07 01:48:33
This forum is a study by itself on mass psychology.  Most of the people here are convinced that the price is manipulated but somehow still believes that it will be manipulated in their favour.
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:59:00
Nope, production cost will adjust itself according to price.
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:52:01
No sarcasm intended but judging by your posts, you really are getting desperate.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:35:07
Media people are shorting it.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:10:46
Tell me how many Tethers are in the market and how many were traded today.
Also, tell me the ratio of BTC trades on American exchanges Vs Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:26:45
lol .... I think the total BTCs owned by everyone in reddit is probably less than 0.1% :)
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:40:06
I heard they are building a separate L2.
Sounds more like they are in it for the fees.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:45:41
Market cap does not change with cash ETFs.  And synthetic ETFs are based on price of underlying asset.
Do you even have some basic understanding of ETFs?
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:08:02
The onus of proof is on Bitfinex as it's their claim that 1 Tether = 1 USD.
As long as they refuse to conduct a CPA certified audit, they are not innocent.
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:35:56
Somehow the simple reason that the low price is simply due to lack of interested buyers is not acceptable.
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:01:00
Blame it on the people going around saying that there's a high chance of it being approved and that the price will shoot to the moon.
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:10:02
Name me a society that is based on anarchy and has not descended into chaos.
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:15:31
Well, if it's of any interest to you, the concentration of wealth in BTC is far more concentrated than any other asset.
I.e. the rich will continue to be rich and the poor will continue to be poor.  The only difference is that the poor with some BTC will fare better than their poor cousins with no BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:20:19
I upvoted you but it's still 0.  Sorry, I tried.
Edit ... it went down to -2.  Your points look like the BTC chart now.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:31:16
Lol .... u know it will just bounce and then go flat between 6 to 8.
Don't wet your pants :)
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:06:38
Unless something earth shaking happens, it's going to go horizontal between 6 to 8 for a long, long time.

Fear can be installed?  Is it a malware and can it be uninstalled?  
Sounds scary.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:33:05
That's because the price is manipulated within this range to pull in the suckers using pump and dump.
Now, if you seriously believe that American exchanges account for less than 5% of the daily trades, then I have a bridge to sell you.
@_date: 2018-08-05 10:41:55
So you ate it and now we are all jinxed.
I see 5k coming.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:46:41
Lol :)
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:49:22
That's the $B question.
And frankly, nobody knows.  There's no maths to it and it will be entirely driven by sentiments.  Market can just shrug and dismiss it or it can panic and crash.
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:18:57

Real volume using USD is no more than $100m per day.
The $3B to $4B are mostly fake trades.

Don't be so insecure.  You sound pathetic.
@_date: 2018-08-19 07:10:50
All I will say is that the current price of BTC is not real as it's propped up by Tethers.  At some point, regulators will step in, price will collapse and we will know then what the market is really prepared to pay.
Money?  First, I'm pretty confident that my stash is much bigger than yours.  And my current short is 2.4x since 15k.  I will cash in my short when it crash and will be super happy if it goes to 30k after that.  Either way, I win, which is why I kept telling you that the price does not bother me.
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:24:22
hmm.  Ok.  Let me try another:
"will BTC still exist during your time in the future?"

There are only 3 groups of people making money:
Early adopters who bought before 2013.  Even those who bought before 2017 will soon be in the red.
Exchanges.  That's why you see new ones popping up on an almost weekly basis.
Short sellers.  These are the ones creaming up the market.
Everyone else is a sucker or just "in for tech".  
Sorry, just stating the obvious.
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:22:34
It will be interesting for the government of Japan to explain why inflation rate is 70% this year.  
... or that there's nothing they can do about it as the price is determined by the Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:52:54
I would say that most of the more serious players here fall into the same category.  We are vested mostly in traditional assets (stocks, properties, etc) and putting aside a small amount (&lt; 5%) in cryptos.
As for when to put in the money, you will hear a big range of opinions here.  My own opinion is that the current price is built on a house of cards, ... with Tethers and 90% of the trades are fake (wash trades) on the Chinese exchanges.  So if BTC is to be taken seriously as a long term investment vehicle, this house of cards must first come down (which invariably will result in price collapse).
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:37:14
Because any government can impose a law that will outright ban trading and selling using crypto overnight.
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:11:46
Possible but it's going to be rejected so why bother?
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:08:45
Well, depends on what you believe.  DCA is a good strategy if you believe there's a bounce coming up but can't time it.  But in a bear market with no clear bottom, it may not be a good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:29:26
US Bonds.
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:21:31
The run up to 20k was mostly manipulated using Tether.
As to whether Bitfinex will dare to do it again, maybe.
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:30:37
Currency is one of the primary lever of government fiscal policies.  
So nope, unlikely.
If BTC becomes 'good as gold' for international trade, it may be held as reserves by governments.

Errr .... why do you keep responding to yourself?
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:51:40
Given that it has remained above 6k for 10 months, why do you think it's going to go down further?
@_date: 2018-08-06 08:34:12
Yo .... since when is the BTC market rational?
It's been mostly pumps and dumps regardless of good or bad news.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:50:29
Nah.  I think it will continue to go flat between 6 to 8.
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:33:18
No, I haven't and simply don't see the need to as it's irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:11:35
If demand drops, price drops accordingly.
If cost cannot sustain price, then some miners will simply stop mining and complexity will drop accordingly.
That's the beauty of BTC - it works at any price.
@_date: 2018-08-04 02:10:48
It is not even legal tender is almost every country including America.

You don't need morons for price to fall in a deflating balloon.
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:58:10
And when you pay $x for a BTC, does the money go to "the tech".  Of course not.  It's just fiat circulating among the speculators.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:43:58
Lol ... maybe I should have :).
But honestly, it doesn't really bother me.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:58:28
Sure ... to be followed by another dump.
Look, BTC has been falling since Dec with no indication that it has hit bottom.  I would say hold off all buying till it bottoms out.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:36:47
Stop spamming.  It's irritating.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:44:21
"that's how tether works"?
That all (or more) of all the Tethers out there in the market is being traded 24 x 7?

See?  Each time u post, the price drops a bit.  So you are responsible :P
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:15:49
Good question, it will be interesting to see how it's implemented.
Starbucks is a publicly traded US company and eventually, financials must be accounted for in USD (sales, profit, etc).  How it's priced will eventually be dependant on it's risk appetite.
0% risk will probably mean conversion from/to fiat at point of sale and passing on all overheads including transaction fee to customers.  A higher risk appetite may mean setting aside a BTC settlement account.  This is very common in MNCs where foreign currencies from non-US subsidiaries are managed separately.
@_date: 2018-08-14 10:43:30
Won't happen.
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:57:17
This is too complicated.
So going Up or Down to Flat?
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:37:02
I can understand people who bought at 15k because it came soon after ATH and may be read as a pull back.
People who are still buying after it has crashed for 8 months are just being retarded.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:01:29
Don't bother.
They will be resurrected and howling for the moon once the price go to 7k.
And when the price go to 8k, projections to $200k by 2020 will begin.
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:50:14
So says the person who's vested in creating crypto investment vehicles.
Only that he got it wrong.  Throughout history, it has always been great products that drive demand, not access points (which is where he makes his money). 
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:30:36
"We"?  Sorry but I doubt if most of us feel as oppressed and desperate as you do.
Chill out.  The price will most likely bounce back up within a week or two.
 
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:31:22
You can't ignore it.  The entire crypto market is contaminated.
Fact is - you can buy a BTC using Tether on a Chinese exchange and sell the same BTC on an American exchange for USD.  That means arbitrage will drive the price of BTC up/down based on the price on the Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:41:23
Just like any market, it is all all intertwined.  It's not a zero sum game among BTC and the alts.
Point is - you shouldn't be wishing ill on other coins as it will come back to BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:30:00
It was a joke from the start.
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:24:10
I think you got me mixed up with someone else.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:00:03
That's because they somehow believe it's a zero sum game among the coins.  
Which is not very smart as a simple observation will show that all the coins including BTC move up/down as a group more often than not.
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:41:14
I would like to believe that the American exchanges are honest and the numbers are real.  I also do not believe that this represents only 5% of the total trades; and therefore I conclude that the other 95% are mostly fake (wash trades).
And yes, I find it very suspicious that despite this obvious and highly visible phenomena, none of the "gurus" like Tom Lee have even mentioned it.  So yes, I believe that people like him are in the pockets of the manipulators a long long time ago.
@_date: 2018-08-07 01:39:43
High volume wash trades.  
E.g. market is trading at 6967 and there are 100 genuine BTC trades during a minute.  Wash trades comes in and generate 1,000 fake trades at 6968.  That overwhelms the genuine volume and artificially inflate the price to 6968.
Bots are used to do this.  Go look at Tether and how it's used to pump up prices across the Chinese exchanges.  
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:02:34
Any asset that appreciates 1,000% within a year and without any sound basis is called a bubble.
And even at 6k, it is still in a bubble.
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:45:38
Gosh .... you actually trying to explain monetary economics to hodlers?
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:34:07
It's not BTC pushing the alts.  
The entire crypto market including BTC is shrinking.  Just this month alone, it has dropped from 272B to 202B.  
No, this is not good for BTC. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:13:45
Interest rates.
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:17:17
Just identify the handful of American exchanges and add it up.
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:22:26
The point will be lost on the hodlers.
They will simply change the narrative to "two years ago Bitcoin was only $X".
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:41:39
I'm too lazy to sell (or too emotionally attached).
It's not neutral.  More like 40% covered.  And yes, it's been open for months.  If it had gone up, I would have just covered my short with my stash.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:55:23
Nope.  It's due to $50m of new Tethers being wash traded.
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:49:20
Hmm.  The price of BTC does not represent the value of the underlying technology.  
When you buy a share of Apple, that's an investment that will appreciate in value when Apple is more successful.  When you buy an iPhone, you are just a customer.  
BTC is the iPhone and the beauty of BTC is that the underlying tech is actually mostly open sourced.  I.e. you can't "invest in the tech".
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:26:23
Why do people keep saying 6.5 is the floor when we are below 6.5 most of this week.
@_date: 2018-08-04 02:13:54

They do know that they can't make money from their own ass.
Ok, that is not 100% accurate but I digress.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:19:35

@_date: 2018-08-11 11:35:42
Go buy 2,000 BTC now at 6,115. 
When it goes up by a $100 to 6,215, you can go buy a Huracan.
Congrats and welcome.
@_date: 2018-08-20 00:20:29
Tether has been going on overdrive mode.
Printed another $250m this week from thin air and wash trading increased from $2.4B to $2.7B daily ..... just enough to hold the current price.
So .... likely price will go down (that's the default) unless Bitfinex prints another $500m in Tethers.
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:41:48
So what's this truth that you are talking about?
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:56:48
There is no evidence that it has hit bottom.
Everyone who has tried to catch this falling knife since Dec has gotten burnt.  It's better to wait and see where it lands.
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:12:32
I would like to see that succeed. 
If it does, more large scale merchants will start accepting BTC.  
That, to me, is a far more important milestone than the ETF nonsense.
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:14:08
Lol .... you don't have to keep re-assuring yourself :)
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:01:49
Why would anyone prefer anarchy and chaos that will arise from collapse of governments and the world financial system? 
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:02:54

Alright, I guess you are just here to provide comic relief.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:23:35
Nah.  So that they can keep their customers and sell them their own products.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:56:47
Nah.  It will just bounce between 6-8.
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:55:27
Yes, of course.
All we need to do is to chant 'hodl' and have blind faith that the price will go up (someday).
@_date: 2018-08-19 06:54:48
Wow ... such anger.
Anyone can see that it's Tethers that is propping up BTC's price through wholesale wash trading.
And yes - that means BTC is nowhere near it's real bottom.
@_date: 2018-08-18 04:16:24
Dude, I know tons of them as I'm a consultant to financial industry clients.
And I can tell you with absolute certainty that most of them sees cryptos as a joke.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:51:19
Fuck Turkey.
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:23:53
Lol ... I think that's a rather fatal attitude where investing is concerned.
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:52:31
Hang in there .... they printing more Tethers.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:22:00
It's not theory when $2.4B of trades are conducted daily using Tethers.
Why do you think legit banks refused to do business with them?
Why do you think they have to keep fleeing from country to country to avoid prosecution?
Why do you think they refused to accept US Citizens as customers other than to tell SEC it's not within their jurisdiction?
Let's just admit it - you and many others are suggesting that it's legit is simply due to your fear that Tether is a scam that will lead to total price collapse of all cryptos.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:21:28
Probably some bots running arbitrage.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:40:22
Omg .... u r psychic!  Do you come from the future?
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:18:17
You are incoherent.
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:28:24
If you ask bitfinex nicely, they will give you exactly the bot you want.
It's now used to churn the $50m of Tethers they printed recently.
@_date: 2018-08-05 10:36:03
BTC will not solve this issue.
It has the highest concentration of ownership compared to all other asset classes.
@_date: 2018-08-07 01:44:06
The price is decided on the Chinese exchanges where most of the trades are fake.  They alone decide what the price is.
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:13:44
Your point?  Gloating and countering a claim that speculation can bring the price to $100k are two different things.
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:14:46
It has nothing to do with economics.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:16:23
Smoking gun?  Well, do you know of any legit company with $2.4B of assets and zero audit?
Anyway, believe what you want.  At some point in time, this Tether crap is going to be exposed and BTC's price will collapse.
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:04:24
I spend 1/3 of my time in China for the last two decades so I can tell that you don't have a clue about China.
Fintech there is far more advance than US/Europe and it's now the leading cashless society.  BTC?  It's passe and considered to be an "old man's game".
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:32:35
Not at all.
You can see that the Tether wash trading is working extra hard nowadays to keep it above 6k
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:19:39
Actually 1. created 2. last year.
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:16:07
My preference is irrelevant.
The original post stated that it's a security feature and I merely stated that's untrue since mining is centralised in China.
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:50:12
As far as I can remember, that's the price when it was useful for actually buying stuff.
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:42:16
&lt; $7k.
Let's see how long it takes to go back up.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:04:13
Who is accepting it?  You must be really dense.
When you own both the printing and the exchange, you can sell the same BTCs to yourself over and over again using your own printed currency.
And I said there are more Tethers printed AFTER BTC's price starts to drop, not before.  Learn to read simple English.
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:21:12
Lol ... you are delusional if you think the Chinese citizens are stupid enough to believe that BTC protect their rights or resist their government.
The Chinese are one of the most realistic people on earth.  They know what matters and it definitely isn't about digital tokens.
@_date: 2018-08-18 08:49:28
It's not even approved yet so why are you going around shilling as it is and that it will result in a price jump to BTC?
You are being intentionally misleading and you know it.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:05:39
It just went below 6k USD.
$250 drop in minutes and still dropping.
$300 drop ... wow
Bounced off 5900.  Nice

All good tales need a believable story.
@_date: 2018-08-18 08:56:32
Well, a lot of them do trade with play money and have had a lot of good laughs shorting it (including me).
It's just a silly game with $ put on digital tokens, most of which (including BTC) has no real world use cases that matters.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:19:00
That's the very reason why ETFs is a very bad idea.
You take the manipulation and push it into the broader market.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:28:20
When $2.4B of Tethers are traded more than 100% every day, you do not need a statistician to tell you it's wash traded.
When the price and market cap of cryptos have fallen 70%, you do not need a PhD in economics to tell you that supply of stable coins should be reduced rather than created.
Sure, you can dismiss all of these as 'conspiracies' but facts are facts.
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:12:33
That's the problem - we have been conditioned to think of the bottom being "post ATH", i.e. 6K.
I'm not saying it will drop below that.  But frankly, there is absolutely no basis for either case since the price is 100% speculated.
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:51:15
Dude ....
BTC dominance increasing when BTC price is increasing is good.
BTC dominance increasing when BTC price is dropping is BAD.  That means people are losing interest in cryptos altogether.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:45:57
Every asset is getting hammered today.
Stocks, Gold, Commodities, .... 
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:49:04
Probably.  It's been trading within the 6k-8k for months already.
Just pump and dump and repeat.
@_date: 2018-08-05 05:57:21
It's actually 6986. 
But so what?  Unless you are trading thousands of BTCs on daily basis, it's irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:47:21
Your claim is a joke considering that Bitfinex has refused to conduct an audit and has already stated clearly that they will not redeem Tethers for USD. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:10:43
How the fuck can anyone lose 98% other than through leveraged trades.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:45:44
I'm waiting for that to happen.  It will be a total reset.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:12:05
If it's true, North Korea would have built a nuclear reactor to mine BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:26:07
That's not true and you shouldn't be spreading BS to encourage people to buy.
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:18:51
I understand your point.  
But when go into the details of that $2.7B daily trades, it's mostly for BTC/USDT.  Otherwise, I would have agree with you.
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:24:31
I think you meant deflation from USD.
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:31:39
I don't believe there are that many morons around.  
Morons are critical for speculation.

Mumbo Jumbo nonsense.

Cool!  Hope you take some of it and use it to buy stuff.  Put it into circulation.
@_date: 2018-08-18 08:44:22
Actually I do understanding this stuff because it's what I have been doing for decades.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:29:09
A real loss far outweighs an opportunity cost.
The reason why people lose money in investing is to keep betting against the trend.  The smart money comes in after the losers are cleaned out.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:31:41
Clean out of the obvious manipulation where 90% of the trades are on unregulated Chinese exchanges and Tethers taken out of system.  That will invariably lead to price collapse and a price reset.
That is bottom.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:07:35
Lol ... of course there's no market manipulation.  That happens only when price spikes upwards right?
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:54:46
Lol ... maybe.  I won't mind though .... gives me an exit.
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:41:09
Because you are looking at price in USD and USD has grown very strong.
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:03:48
Long ago.  Started it as a hedge for my stash.  
On hindsight, it's one of my best move.
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:09:38
Why stop at 80 or 100?  Try 1m.
After all, there's zero basis for any of these numbers.
@_date: 2018-10-02 09:50:23
Because I already have a substantial batch of coins.
At 17k and dropping, I can either (a) cash out or (b) hold or (c) hold and take a hedge against the price dropping.
I opted for (c).
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:18:33
Wow!  
Then you shouldn't be announcing this amazing discovery and take your time to build a huge horde!
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:15:55

@_date: 2018-10-09 07:42:29
The moron level is directly proportional to the current BTC price in this sub.

You must be one of those redneck Trump supporters.
MAGA!!  Lol :)
@_date: 2018-10-03 10:38:35
For me, it was more of an emotional attachment (i.e. I didn't want to sell).  So next best is to just take a hedge.  
Technically, both achieve the same goal as a short essentially does the same.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:18:45

Aren't the points still valid?

Ok, you have nothing.  
Maybe it's time for you to shut up instead of dismissing every report as a conspiracy?
@_date: 2018-10-08 03:24:00
I think 25k-50k is in Indian Rupees.

Feel free to quote an alternative view.
@_date: 2018-10-08 05:00:17
Well, I won't even try to make a prediction on how far it will collapse.
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:29:12
So those who were claiming that they "don't lose till they sell" must have been liars.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:13:49
My pleasure.
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:12:28
Didn't I say that the short was a hedge?
If you understood what I was saying, you won't be rumbling about luck or being smug.

Market cap of BTC is going to grow to size of M2.  No doubts about that.

Confidence will disappear and everyone will be rushing to cash out.  There will be nothing left to prop up.

Are you some sort of rabid dog?
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:23:16
Zzzzz ... tell me something that I don't already know.
The entire crypto market is so plagued with manipulation, any financial tool built on top of it will be just another instrument for more gaming.
If you haven't leant that by now, then there's not much for us to discuss.
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:22:33
So what's your definition of a healthy discussion?
We have $2.4B of Tether trades every day, issued by a company that refused to be audited and have been refused banking services by every credible bank.
Instead of admitting that this is a concern for BTC, you dismiss it as a "conspiracy" despite DAILY reports by credible sources.
So don't give me this "healthy discussion" pitch.  
@_date: 2018-10-08 05:03:06
Go read this forum history. 
The "last chance to buy at $x" is as wrong as it is old.
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:26:04
That's why I said there are many here hoping for some miracle to cut their losses and get out of the market.
@_date: 2018-10-03 10:40:09

Heck, even stocks are more volatile these days.

There's no need for personal attacks on everyone who voice a negative opinion.  That's what a rabid dog does.

A $2.4B company that has to hide behind a shell company for banking services :)
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:24:01
Money needs to be a store of value in order to function as an intermediary for trade.  Isn't that obvious?
Yes, it's inflationary by design.  That's why most people will keep only a small amount for convenience.
Rest, we invest in vehicles that beat inflation.  I own BTC (no other cryptos) in my portfolio in addition to stocks, bonds and properties.
So what exactly is your issue?
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:45:46
I think we are going to see a pump soon.
Number of short positions grew by over 2,000 positions in last 24 hours.
Shorts rekk incoming.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:03:50
You sure they coming?  It's taking too long.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:22:47
Lol!  I would say there are idiots in both camps.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:04:12
Venezuela is the result of fiscal mismanagement and if you feel that's a good use case for BTC, fine - I got no arguments against it.
For rest of the world, the current financial system works just fine.  And to wish death upon millions - you are a lunatic.  Free?  Free of what?  The alternative to government is chaos.  Name me please one example of a truly free society in all of history that thrived and prospered.
You think cryptos is the answer?  Well, think again where the price of BTC is being decided.  90&amp; of the trading is carried out on shady exchanges in China and if you think the price is truly market driven, then you are naive and stupid.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:34:39
Probably lost a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:51:25
Deflation kills economies as all economic activities crawl to a standstill.
The only effective instrument is quantitative easing, which is not possible using a currency that is, by design, limited in quantity.  Whoever thinks BTC is a good replacement for fiat needs to go back for Econ classes.
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:34:27
Dude, I own plenty since I started collecting way back when mining was possible on a PC.  
All I'm saying is that there are plenty of people here who have lost money and your gloating/trolling is not in good taste.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:23:51
It's not a Ponzi.  But yes, it's a speculative asset - high risk/high returns.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:39:03
Short has increased this month from 20,000 to 26,000 positions.  Long is now at 34,000 positions.
So take a guess which one will get rekked first?
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:21:09
Currency devaluation/inflation is the consequence of poor fiscal governance, not the cause of it.  
Where Venezuela is concerned, BTC is not going to solve their problems.
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:30:27
What precisely do you mean by "USD collapses"?
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:13:10
Who the heck keeps anything in cash other than a small amount for convenience reasons?
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:24:21
After Nov 2013, BTC declined, went flat for 3 years and then hit ATH in 2017.
So yes, it is possible.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:36:13
My friend, if cryptos ever even come near to become a threat to governments or the world financial system, what do you think will happen?
It is very simple for governments to pass laws that will make it illegal to trade with cryptos.  Morocco is one place that has done that.  Sure, it's hard to crack down on a decentralised system but they don't need to do that.  They just have to crack down on the merchants and impose heavy fines/jail if they accept cryptos.  If you can't buy/sell using cryptos, then it's as good as dead.
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:02:51
You can keep pressing your case.  At the end of the day, as I have said - karma is a thing.  So if you are not concerned that your behaviour will come back to haunt you, then continue with your trolling.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:54:38
Have you folks noticed the sudden increase in number of China based exchanges?
There is now [ZB.COM]( BigONE, Coinsuper, etc.  
And frankly, I cannot believe that an exchange can pop up overnight and start processing over $250m of cryptos.
Didn't China clamped down on these shady exchanges months ago?
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:45:19
Actually, only 10&amp; is used in industry and that demand is not what drives the price of gold.
Gold is valuable simply because people thinks it is, is willing to pay for it for thousands of years and as a consequence, governments hold them in reserves as a hedge for their own currency.
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:48:21
While I'm trying my best to be optimistic, I'm also realistic about the situation.
How many times have we heard the same thing?  $18k, $17k, $15k, $10k, $8k, $7.5k, $7k, ......
This "tide has turned" narrative is getting old.
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:05:20
I keep hearing these rhetorics and most are unfortunately untrue.
I do not see adoption as a currency and the general public is happy with the current financial system.  It's not perfect but it's legitimate and the customer instruments have improved by leaps.  Almost all merchants accept credit/debit cards (and of course cash) and e-payment is also now widely accepted where payment can be made with a simple to use NFC.  National level cross-bank systems now allow transfers between banks that are instant and $0 fee.  Across countries, SWIFT has served us well for decades.
If you want anonymous, just use cash.  And why would I care about staying anonymous when my purchases are legit and I have nothing to hide?
I'm sorry but this whole narrative about cryptos being superior to the current banking system is just a fringe movement that the public is not interested in.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:10:27
Stop being so full of yourself.  BTC is bitcoin.
BTC is an investment for me.  You don't seem to be able to discern between investment and currency.

I'm a big supporter of BTC and I wish we will stop this nonsense about it being a safe store of value.
There is nothing "safe" about the value of an asset when it can go up 10x in a year and drop 70&amp; over 6 months.
Let's stop this nonsense as we all know it's baloney.  If we keep saying such idiotic things, it will just end up killing BTC's credibility.

He's probably not old enough to own a credit card.

BTC and cryptos in general is a volatile, high risk/high return asset.  
It has no place in 401k, which is a retirement fund and provides the social security for our retirees.  I frankly cannot imagine the stress it will put retirees through if their retirement funds were to have dropped 70&amp; in months.
While I can understand your wanting the price of BTC to appreciate, please do so responsibly and thoughtfully instead of spouting such nonsense.
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:40:16
A jump to 6.8k will be a big morale boost to current holders. 
Doubt if it will create a bull run.  
At 6.8k, the news headline will say "BTC 65&amp; down this year".
Let's be candid - would any potential new investor pour money in an asset that lost so much in months?
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:02:26
Obviously (a) people who bought at a lower price and wants to take some profit off the table, (b) short sellers and (c) panic sellers who bought at higher price.
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:44:20
Let's wait and see.  I think it will go up higher.
But it's amusing when price goes $500 vertical - no one complains.  But when it goes down $500 the same way, everyone here will be yelling "manipulation" :)
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:59:18

@_date: 2018-06-28 06:58:08
If there's anything we learnt, it's that the public has a very short memory.
If price of BTC starts to go up, it's a no-brainer that FOMO will again set in and push the price up higher.
Whether the price is justifiable or not becomes moot because that is how the market behaves.  And it's not just cryptos - take a look at the P/E of some of the Tech stocks.  Netflix's price doubled this year and is still climbing despite having a P/E of over 260!!!
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:57:23
I know precisely what it is.
All I'm saying is that it's bad taste for you to be saying it now.  It's probably more acceptable when prices are high and such warnings are fair game.

What does the Purple line mean?
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:54:16
Normally, it would be logical to short.
But the problem is, I believe that the major exchanges (especially Bitfinex) are themselves manipulating the price and making a killing wiping out leveraged Shorts/Longs whenever they stack up.
So what's your take on this?
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:04:33
Put it this way - the best way for the exchanges to make real money is to rekt the leveraged Longs and Shorts.
And if you believe (as I do) that the exchanges are responsible for the price manipulation, then this scenario makes sense.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:54:36
I do not believe it's possible for a dozen of these exchanges to spring from nowhere with each having twice the trade volume of GDAX.
It will not be a surprise if we trace the origins and it all leads back to Bitfinex/Tether.
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:27:21
I see you are really having fun.
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:51:46
It's a game of chicken.
We need to assume that there is a certain degree of price manipulation and exchanges are complicit in it.  Such exchanges stand to gain a lot when a large pool of leveraged Shorts (or Longs) gets rekked when they manipulate a large price change.
So it boils down to a game of chicken - holding a leveraged position long enough to gain and get out before the position gets rekked.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:41:33
26,000 positions so yeah.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:40:23
I'm immune.  Been in this for far too long.
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:13:36
Talk about blatant price manipulation on the Chinese exchanges .....
KEY - Market cap $72m but Daily Trades $286m (90&amp; of it for BTC).
"Fly by Night" exchanges springing out of nowhere, each bigger than GDAX - [ZB.COM]( Coinsuper, Bibox, .....
Anyway, as long as they are helping to pump up the price of BTC, I'm fine with it.

@_date: 2018-07-01 02:39:57
Like I said, it's not the technology.
You just can't use a currency with prices that fluctuate like BTC.  You may not care about BTC's price but merchants do.  They can't re-price their goods and services by changing it every few hours.
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:40:04
You have very little understanding of how ETFs work.  Let me try to explain it (again) to you:
a.  Cash based ETF - Zero sum game, no increase in size of market.  Pooled funds are used to buy BTCs.  Since this is a single asset ETF, cash based unlikely to be used.
b.   Synthetic ETF - Derivative, zero capital goes into BTC market.  The ETFs are traded as a function of BTC's price.  This will be the likely ETF for BTC.
In short, neither scenario does any good for BTC.
Like I said - this is just another gimmick that trading houses want to create to earn commission for themselves and provide you more ropes to hang yourself.

"HitBTC and its not reliable website for coin trade/exchange service.[5] by Hit Solution Limited is registered on Hong-Kong jurisdiction with the number 2510720"
ZB.COM is a cryptocurrency exchange based in China that started in November 2017
Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, China under the name Binance International. 
Yes, we all know that a lot of these exchanges are clamped down by regulators and running all over the world trying to find a home.  But it's still Chinese owned and caters to the Chinese market.
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:04:04
I agree with you on the need for regulations to eliminate fraud, etc.
But you are wrong in that ETF will solve the problem.  As long as the underlying asset can't be effectively regulated, building an ETF on top of it amplifies the risk, not solve it.  And it's because of this very reason that SEC has so far refused to allow a BTC ETF.
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:27:46
Sorry, wrong again.  Only 8&amp; of fiat is paper cash, rest are all electronic (like your bank account deposits) and being electronic, is no different from cryptos except it doesn't need resources for mining.
That is why the world is moving more and more into cashless societies.  Branchless Banks is another instrument to enable this as with advancements in e-payment.  When that happens, all the logistical cost associated with paper cash goes away.

Whether BTC has a bright future is still on debate.  I think it has but at the moment, it's clogged with price manipulation.

Shorting does NOT bring the price down anymore than buying Long drives the price up.  And it's silly to think so because when a Short position is taken, someone else is buying at the same time.
The only difference is the sequence - sell/buy vs buy/sell.  The people who Short believes that the price will go down (but doesn't mean it will).  And people who buy Long believes that the price will go up (but again, doesn't mean it will).
@_date: 2018-07-14 06:25:04
Oh please .... BetterHash works for public pools.  But when pools are centrally owned such as Bitmain, it's useless.
PoW change as tofuspider suggested?  Try doing another fork and see how fast an organization like Bitmain, with plenty of resources, can adapt.
The point is - there is little that is unique to a large group of decentralised users that cannot be replicated into a central pool controlled by a single business entity.

SEC's decision to reject Bitcoin ETF is the right decision.
Winklevoss's proposal takes BTC out of circulation.  This works against the adoption of BTC as a currency.
The other 5 ETFs proposals are worse - they are mostly derivatives.  That means any capital inflows goes into the ETFs, not into BTC.  
And the leveraged ETF will simply amplify the price manipulation issue by rewarding it with a multiplier.
As I have said - ETFs reward only the exchanges with commission and does nothing good for BTC.

Nope.  
ETF will AMPLIFY the effect and not necessarily in a positive way. 
 Don't forget ETFs will provide a new route to short BTC.
And it all depends on whether it's cash-based or synthetic/derivative.  If it's cash-based, the amount of BTC available for trade does not change.  If it's derivative, then it's building a bubble on top of another bubble.
In both situations, it's not good for BTC.  It's only good for the ETF fund manager and they are giving us new ropes to hang ourselves.
Worst case scenario?  Leveraged ETFs used to short BTC in an unregulated market.  In this scenario, ZERO cash flows into BTC.  Instead, manipulators will take leveraged ETF shorts and then work with the exchanges to force the price down by sharing the spoils with them.

The awful truth is because you can't afford a gold backed dollar.  America didn't have enough gold to back it's currency.  As a country, it was and is still bankrupt.  And it's not NATO (that's a fucking military organization).  America owes other governments through issuance of bonds and the biggest holders of America's debt are China and Japan.
It is because of the international trust in the dollar (and the nice interest that it pays) that America is able sustain it's debt driven economy.  An economy with 5&amp; of the world's population but consumes 24&amp; of the world's resources.  An economy that produces morons like you who takes things for granted and can afford to speculate in BTC, hoping to get rich.
You want to sink the USD and replace it with BTC?  Let me tell you what will happen before that - hyperinflation and sky rocket interest rates.  Leading to American companies going bankrupt as they no longer can afford the cost of capital, leading to unemployment.  And eventually leading to total collapse of the American economy.

See?  Again you fail to understand basic economics.
It does not matter that the cost/hash goes down.  When there is X amount of $ to be made (either through price of BTC or transaction fee), pools will compete till market equilibrium is reached.
So as I have explained, there are only two possible scenarios.  Either transaction fee (which is offset by BTC price) goes up or security goes down.  Whatever savings in cost/hash needed to secure is offset by the same savings in cost/hash needed to compromise BTC's security.
Got it?  Sigh.....

Given that acceptance by merchants is almost zero, the only real backing for BTC is on the exchanges.  Without exchanges, BTC actually has no value.  Sounds ridiculous but think about that for a moment.
And shandy Chinese exchanges now account for 95&amp; of the world's trades.  Guess what will happen when the Chinese government clamp down on them?

Global transaction has been a feature of BTC since it started 8 years ago.  Volume?  Please ... BTC is a dinosaur and so far behind, it's a joke.  AliPay/WeChat alone processed over $15T last year.  
Today, anyone can walk into the vast majority of shops and pay with a wave of a card or phone.  And BTC is still struggling with bandaids like Lightning even when it's accepted in negligible number of merchants.
So .... tell me about how "entwined in our culture".  Go talk to the millennials.  Even they find it uncool to even be associated with BTC these days.  It's all about ApplePay and when daddy is going to give them a credit card.

@_date: 2018-07-02 00:42:54
I don't think anyone is disputing that there is value in BTC.
But let's not confuse production cost, value and price.
The fact is that the value that BTC delivers has not changed whether it was priced at $200 (before 13), $1,000 (before 17) and $6,000 (now).  Sure, the cost has been artificially inflated by mining complexity but the value to user has not changed much.  LN is a great technology but has delivered little real tangible value.
That is why a lot of people are saying that BTC is a bubble.  A bubble is when the price has risen disproportionately to it's value.  And for BTC to rise 10x last year with no real increase in underlying value - that is a bubble by any definition.
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:46:51
BTC has always been a store of value from Day 1.  How else do you think I bought stuff with it?
As an alternative to Gold, it must first be accepted as an international currency, then carry enough weight to be a reserve currency.  Gold is valuable because of this reason - it is held as reserve by governments to finance imports in case it's own currency is rejected.  
So the claim that BTC is "Digital Gold" today is BS.  It needs first to be accepted as a currency then elevate to being accepted by governments as solid enough to be held in reserves.  This is when it becomes Digital Gold.
Now you understand why the claim that BTC will replace fiat is retarded?  Acceptance by governments for international settlement is a pre-requisite to BTC becoming a Gold alternative.  And you can't achieve that by attempting to undermine the primary lever for fiscal governance, which is government control of fiat.

Yes - 51% attack is a concern.  As I understand, this is precisely the discussion point among the participants.  What I understand is that they are trying to reach a consensus by limiting the among of hashpower that each group of stakeholders can have.  What they do not want is an 'arms race'.
You are right in that it will not be a true trustless system like BTC.  The incentives will be capped and driven by the need to cover operational cost.

@_date: 2018-07-06 06:39:19
Firstly, my point is that blockchain has far more use cases than just cryptos.  UPS is an example.
Secondly, UPS is not implementing a private, centralized blockchain.  It is an industry wide implementation cutting across the entire logistics value chain.  And it will be decentralised because the processing nodes will be spread across the many companies involved in the logistics chain.

@_date: 2018-07-14 15:23:51
In other words, it's theoretical and no one has a clue on how it can be implemented.
It's currently a false economy where the cost of transacting is offset by the price of BTC.  Once last coin is mined, the full cost of mining will have to be recovered through transaction fees.  The cost will either be so high that it's no longer viable to transact or the security compromised as hash power is reduced.
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:49:28

Look, it is a legitimate comparison.
The litmus test is simple - can an asset multiply 10x in price without a rational 10x increase in performance?  
If not, the price is disproportionate to it's value and is therefore, a bubble.  Last year's ATH was not due to any real tangible value such as increased adoption or tech improvements that delivered real world benefits.  It was due to speculation and manipulated played a big role.

That's because it's a speculative price with no real floor.

Unfortunately, I think so too.
When the number of Chinese exchanges started popping out of nowhere ([ZB.COM]( Bibox, BCEX, HitBTC, CoinBene) with each processing over $200m each (bigger than GDAX), it's the sign that the last mile money grab is here.
Anyway, I'm not selling.  My horde of coins since it was less than $200 is still where it is and will remain there.

You are failing to grasp the basic point - people who use tech don't care about how difficult it is to implement.  They only care about how easy it is to use.
If you want to impress the geeks, fine - go give a talk about complexity of implementing Lightning.  But who are we depending on to drive adoption?  The merchants and the consumers.  Neither gives a damn about implementation complexity.

Best case begins with exchanges being regulated and price manipulation is brought down to acceptable level.  
The ETFs created must be cash based (not derivatives).  This will not only encourage new investors by easing investment but also capital flows back into BTC.  I.e. High volume of ETF purchases translate into high volume of BTC purchases by ETF managers.
This will then lay down the foundation for institutional investors to seriously consider putting in large amount of capital into BTC.

@_date: 2018-07-06 04:37:55
Yes, I do have a problem trying to pin a value to BTC.  Don't get me wrong - I understand it has value for the things that you mentioned.
The main obstacle in my thought process is the linkage between the price of BTC, the value (as a currency) that it delivers and the underlying cost.
Take Gold as an example.  1oz of Gold is the same whether it's priced at $100 or $1,000.  If used as a media of exchange, it will work regardless of price.  Just like BTC, if demand price falls below mining cost, mining operations will either self-adjust or cease.  But just as Gold price won't increase because of increased mining cost, neither will BTC.  
So .... I have really no fucking idea what BTC is worth.
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:17:16
That's because you have a limited understanding of how the world works (no offence intended).
The point here is relevance vs dominance.  The lesson is that being dominant is no assurance of survival once you become irrelevant.  That's what happened to Blockbuster.
Same here in crypto.  Just because BTC is dominant, it does not ensure that it will survive.  If BTC does not get adopted as a currency, it will become irrelevant.

It does NOT.
Cash ETFs mean that the collective value of the floated ETF must be backed by the same value in BTC.  I.e. the ETF manager must first buy $100m of BTC before he can sell $100m of ETFs.  That $100m of BTC is taken off the market.

You mean you haven't figured that out by now?
@_date: 2018-07-07 07:12:54
How old are you?  
Serious question.
@_date: 2018-07-15 00:42:55
Yeap.  And he might actually share his weed with you.
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:01:38
Lol ... BTC has failed in both.
Method of Payment = Failed as tech is way behind leaders.
Media of Exchange = Failed as acceptance by merchants is so small that it's a joke.
Still want to debate on technicalities?
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:00:13
No, it's not different.  I'm tired of all these "it's different" argument backed by zero basis.  "It's different" is now used as a nonsense argument for every failure.
You are now arguing reducing cost of capital inflow will "change everything".  You think this is "different"?  Sorry mate, you are a newbie.
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:48:32
Pre 2013 price - $200.
Unlike stocks which appreciate in price when the company increases in performance, there is absolutely nothing to justify the increased price premium between $200 and $20,000.

Yeah, I sort of get it that he doesn't like to be told that he's wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-15 06:00:26
This, I agree.
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:55:21
It's quite clear that you have no clue what a 51% attack will do to BTC.  Users in control?  LOL!  
51% attack will allow them to halt transactions and allow them to conduct transactional reversals and double spend.
Now couple that with the fact that the Chinese also owns 90% of the BTC trading on their exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:18:29
Frankly, if everyone who's holding BTC now go out and spend 10&amp; of it, it will really make a difference.
By hoarding coins or doing nothing else other than trading on exchanges, BTC is going to be obsolete.
Exchanges, like forex, should only be used &lt;0.1&amp; of the time.  Think about it - how much of you fiat goes through forex?  That's usually only during overseas trips or the occasional purchase over Internet where price is in foreign currency.
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:59:33
Yes, I did.  And the author clearly does not have a clue on the banking industry.
Her claim on cost lies on the basis of the large number of physical resources involved (people employed, physical banks, etc).
What she clearly does not understand (or just creating FUD) is that banks do a lot more than cashing services.  They provide services like insurance, loans, wealth management, merchant services (trade financing is huge), foreign currency exchange, bank guarantees, etc.  Look into a typical bank setup and you can see it for yourself.  None of these services are provided by cryptos (which is just an intermediary for retail transactions).
Like I said, learn to read more.
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:23:17
I'm negative against BTC being speculated, rampant price manipulation, centralisation of mining and the fixation on price rather than adoption and crazy notions about bringing down governments and banks.
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:19:35
Dude, unsecured mortgages were fine as only some home owners were impacted.
But when it was collateralised with other securities and sold as triple-A, the risk ballooned and caused the subprime crisis.
The important lesson here is do not underestimate the greed and creativity of Wall Street.  Like I said, they will pack shit into fancy boxes and sell them by the truckloads.
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:58:34
Ok, true ... that was a good fight.  But after that, it was mostly crap to fill up Sly's pocket.

@_date: 2018-07-01 02:21:27
Wake up.  Nobody cares about an 8 year old "technology".
People cares about ease of making payments and the next generation e-payment systems are so advanced, it's causing grief to the banks.
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:18:15
I'm sorry, you are right.

It's ironical but cash actually flowed back in stocks on the very first day of the trade war.  
I can't explain it.

Taking BTC out of circulation into an ETF holding is good for BTC?

The only reliable price you should use is from your exchange.
CoinMarketCap is displaying nonsense as it aggregates data from the Chinese scam sites.

Cool.  Doubt if 12,000 of us can fit in though.
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:08:55
That's a rather strange conclusion given that 90% of BTCs are traded on Chinese exchanges and 75% of BTCs are mined in China.
@_date: 2018-07-14 04:31:43
You guys bragged about the "huge investments in hash power" all the time and now claim that users can take back control?  
You and I know very well that is bullshit.

@_date: 2018-07-06 03:27:49
Hello?  
There are plenty of blockchain implementations around the world and none of them involve BTC.  In fact, most of them aren't even crypto use cases.
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:03:31
Isn't that just an arbitrage bot?
@_date: 2018-07-13 05:23:30
Fine.  I guess the definition of failure is subjective.
If you feel that acceptance by a small group of merchants means that it has not failed, then we can agree on that.
Look, I'm not here to put down BTC as I have vested interest as well.  But I prefer to keep it real.  Making highly speculative statements may sound good but when it doesn't materialise, it will just backfire.
@_date: 2018-07-04 05:24:17
Wait till he finds out there are many "darknets" ....
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:35:53
I find it amusing that Tom thinks there's really a science to this since the price is determined by the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:09:23
lol .. I agree with your Iraqi Dinars example.  But come come, you know very well that's troll bait :)
On the other hand, we have pro-BTC coming in here with nonsense like replacing fiat, bringing down central banking, etc.  It is talk like this that irks me.  It's the "let me get rich while rest of world sink" mentality.
Look, I have a vested interest with a horde of BTCs but I deal with the situation rationally.
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:19:43
Yes, agree on security.  But whether you like it or not, there are countless blockchains out there.
@_date: 2018-07-06 13:42:03
Sure.  It was 6.72k just two days ago so it's not a big huddle.

@_date: 2018-07-04 04:54:30
Eventually the exchanges will be clamped down, the whales would have left with the money, price would have collapsed and there will be masses of bag holders.
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:08:24
Argument?  LMFAO!
Tell me precisely what is there to argue when you have made absolutely zero point?  That's why I called you a moron :)
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:56:44
Conspiracy and gloom?  You referring to my view on ETF?  Yes - it's nothing but another tool for trading houses to earn commission and giving you more ropes to hang yourself.  And I will repeat this till you can convince me otherwise.
BetterHash?  I admit I wasn't aware of the proposal but that doesn't change the fact that I'm right in that it will not address the decentralisation issue.  Along with dumb fuck idea about killing ASICs, which will outright kill the security of BTC.
Listen now kid - I deal with projects that span across a wide range of tech and I get retards with 'killer ideas' on my desk every day.  My job is to be objective and analytical and toss out looney ideas.  You, on the other hand, worship developers and "gurus", lick every bone they toss at you and treat it as gospel truths.  
Learn to be objective and think with that pea brain of yours.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:25:21
Since you are so convinced that this market is manipulated, why participate?
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:03:51
No doubt.  But so will a crash.
They profit with volume regardless of whether price is going up or down.
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:42:48
Come on, it's 67xx so it's very close.
But it's interesting that 6800 is a some sort of resistance level.  There is no technical nor psychological basis.  
7k, I can understand.  6.8 is like a random number.
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:05:51
tofuspider is just a troll who randomly drops in and make nonsensical attacks based on troll logic.
He usually backs off into his little corner once you slam him with facts (he has only a limited arsenal of rhetorics that he cut and paste from websites).
@_date: 2018-07-01 01:10:37
BTC's price is now mostly propped up by shitcoins:
Look carefully at the wash trading.  Biggest pair is now BTC/KEY at $422m per day!  KEY's price went up 400&amp; within last few days and is used to do NOTHING other than to Buy/Pump BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:52:31
"Development" ..... lol, is this the best you can do?
And the concept is already obsolete before it can even be implemented.  Let me give you a clue - centralised ownership of mining farms.  The two largest pools (btc.com and antpool) are both controlled by Bitmain.
Gone are the days when it's truly decentralised and mined by users.  It's now a business and owned by the Chinese.
Try not to call someone clueless unless you know what you are talking about.  Otherwise, you end up making an ass of yourself.
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:42:22
I don't think the manipulation is exaggerated.  Do you seriously believe that the American exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, etc) account for less than 3% of the daily $4B trades?
While the wealth distribution is not abnormal, combining it with rampant manipulation is quite unique across the asset classes.
@_date: 2018-07-07 07:23:04
No shit!
Those clowns issuing Tether didn't get the memo.  They need to stop doing that and the price will get to $50k.
@_date: 2018-07-07 07:09:53
Thanks.  Let's just say that I'm realistic and not trying to overthrow governments, bring down banks, get rich sitting on my bum, etc.
Throw out the manipulation and we get price stability.  That will make it investor grade and the institutions will come.  With that, adoption as a currency supplementing fiat will happen.
At the moment, it's just plain ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:42:53
Sorry bro .... but I seriously think regulators stepping in is heaven for short positions.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:00:06
You are so desperate for a price increase that you ignore fundamentals.  Do you even understand the reason for the 2008 financial crisis?  
At least, 2008 was built on top of a tangible asset (properties).  Now you want to build it on top of an asset with questionable value?
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:24:42
Doubt so.  SEC is not comfortable when they have little regulatory control of the underlying asset (BTC).
@_date: 2018-07-15 08:44:22
To do that, BTC first need to establish itself as an alternative to fiat.
Can't you see?  The more trading platforms are promoted, whether exchanges, futures or ETFs, the less likely that BTC is used as a currency.  We are essentially shooting ourselves in the foot.
I'm just waiting for the regulators to clamp down so that all these speculations and price manipulations can be managed down.  That's when true price discovery can start and reach investor grade price acceptance.  That will be the true start of adoption by the merchants.
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:55:45
Yo Nutcase, what floor are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:29:24
It is NOT.
Value is ultimately decided by the accepting party.  Right now, the only place where BTC has any value is on the exchanges and a negligible number of merchants.  Outside of this group, the value of BTC is $0.
Why does this matter?  Because regardless of the decentralised architecture of BTC, the exchanges today are mostly centralised.  If there are no exchanges (regulatory, hacks resulting in insolvency, etc), value of BTC will become $0.
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:44:35
What do you meaning?
Comparing CMC with which exchange?
@_date: 2018-07-23 00:30:55
It's diverting simply because most of the top cryptos can be bought directly with fiat these days.  I.e. unpegged from BTC, simple as that.
@_date: 2018-07-07 07:24:15
Why bother with all the tax overheads.
The Morocco government just outright ban it.
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:34:18
Yes, of course.  US ... the most indebted nation in the world.
And please enlighten us - how will adopting BTC help the US?
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:33:15
Tether is doing fine :P
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:48:36
You cannot ignore the FACT that BTC is an unregulated market and that the prices are blatantly manipulated.  Until the regulators bring this under control, it is just giving manipulators another tool.  
Tell me what good does ETF, or for that matter, all these speculation tools like exchanges and futures do for BTC?  NOTHING.  
It just encourages speculation and if you take a good look at the larger picture, is KILLING BTC.
Understand this simple principle - Value is determined by the accepting party.  Right now, with little adoption by merchants, BTC is worth $0 on anywhere other than exchanges.  When it's widely adopted, that changes as goods and services are PRICED using BTC.  That's when BTC has real Value beyond exchanges and other trading platforms.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:43:01
Fine.  'Yet' is still out on verdict.
