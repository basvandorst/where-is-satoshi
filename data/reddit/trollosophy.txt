Absolutely. You all know math and science. I know... idiots. This will make Bitcoin digestible for them.
"Bits" is a perfect term for _so_ many reasons. It's a known "computer-ey" term, which further solidifies Bitcoin as "THE" cryptocurrency (or "that computer-money" as an idiot would think of it.) If you ask a stupid person what a Bitcoin is made of, they'll say "Bits." If that actually IS what it's called, they'll **REMEMBER** it; anything else and it instantly loses that memorability to an idiot - even if it's close, like "milli-bits."
Appeal to the lowest common denominator - it's stupid, but it's critical to making something "catch on" with idiots. And the less you assume that to be a negligible demographic, the safer your bets are.

"no extracurricular activities needed."
This is a pretty nice way of describing something you've designed to be stupidly-intuitive. Stealing it.
Also, I agree with everything this guy said and he gets how/why it's important to design things to be (what I call) stupidly-intuitive.

It takes a certain balance of patience and wit to respond to an idiot this well.

Like making viruses that just skip the "pay the ransom" part and go straight to encrypting everyone's data and then deleting itself. 
You're barking up the wrong tree, here. The fact that this virus happens to be ransomware is about as relevant as the fact that it happens to accept BTC.
