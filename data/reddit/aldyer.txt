I can send money instantly to someone who has my bank internationally without any fees, no bitcoin needed. And the decentralization of Bitcoin is definitely not as good as it could be.

No they aren’t, there are plenty of other crypto currencies and yeah it sure as shit needs a lot of changes... It’s a horrible waste of resources at the moment.  You have to be sarcastic...

A. There isn’t any inherent obstacle for banks to be global and there are global large banks. Furthermore the new startup generation of banks  aims to be borderless. 
B. The bank has no interest in denying legal transactions.
C. Inflation is a useful feature in currency, to hold value you invest into bitcoin/gold/whatever you believe in. Bitcoin isn’t a stable store of value anyways.

And how would you know that? Bitcoin development is moving a lot slower than its competitors.

Same here man, it's a dank meme. Bitcoin is unstoppable.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:04:33
This is good for bitcoin.

Y'all in this sub will destroy Bitcoin with your idealistic disagreements. BTC is gonna be worth pennies when it hard forks.

Dude, it's a Finnish owned paper. It's actually one of the few non-propaganda sources.

Alright I made an account and verified stuff already. I live in a really small place so in-person is impossible for me, unfortunately.

Yeah now I know how I can cash out. Litecoin, DOGEcoin etc. -&gt; bitcoin from btc-e and then sell them there. Already sold some to test and seems great, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:42:45
I'll have a look :)
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:42:35
Is that safe? 
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:37:58
Yeah, but it has to be 3 months old so that kind of sucked, but localbitcoins seems to be great for me anyway :)
