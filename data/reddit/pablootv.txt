This is what I want to see, real people achieving small dreams, this is even better than seeing that early investor taking a pic of his 4th lambo inside of his tesla.

just don’t do it right now, I don’t mean to offend you, but you clearly are not well informed in bitcoin. We are growing too fast right now, and one of the possible reasons for this is wallstreet sharks getting in the bitcoin so they can short it in the near future (dec 10). I might be wrong and bitcoin never come back to lower 10ts but I might be right and we go from 17,000 to 5000 in a blink. Knowledge is freedom buddy, let me know if you need help to find jt.
Edit: I wrote this thinking that you were investing 50 thousand dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:02:53
invest your 50 bucks and take your time to learn about the coin, and stay tuned to the news.

Japanese know their money will go bananas once their debt explodes and banks stop lending money to them, that’s why bitcoin so popular over there.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:23:46
cool, now go back to facebook.

And btw smart ass, you should know that futures are usually bought in the REAL WORLD by people that actually provide said commodities (e.g a farmer putting 10% of his profit against his own corn, just to have a little cushion if a fucking meteor lands on top of his crops).
Why would a trader want to short bitcoin if they can just buy bitcoin itself and have an almost guaranteed profit by the end of month? Who the fuck is going to short bitcoin? 
CME said that if the market swings more than 7% in a day they will stop operations, I do believe this is s bit low for bitcoin but still. These guys want to make money, they want to ride the bull as much as you, I or OP wants. Don’t go harsh on this guy, you probably watched 3 youtube videos and read 2 coindesk posts and think you are a bitcoin genius. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:34:37
I am glad to see more and more examples of people living of their coins, I do think you gonna get more stressed and bored tho.

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:36:54
you know futures are not against bitcoin, right? 
Futures in the real world are usually bought by people that actually deal with the product in question (e.g a farmer that puts 10% of his profit in futures, shorting his own corn)
Why he does that? because he will make a lot of money selling his corn if the prices go up and will only lose on those 10%. On the other hand those 10% work like a fluffy cushion in case that a fucking meteor lands on top of his crops.
Now, let’s think, who would do that in bitcoin world? Miners! They will have to pay electricity the following month even if bitcoin goes to 0.
Next, we have to think, who the hell would short bitcoin? banks? traders? They want to ride the money bull as much as we want, why short bitcoin if you can have an almost guaranteed profit by the end of the month?
Another thing we have to remember is that CME actually has some kind of stop loss on their future market, they said that if the market swings more than 7% up or down in a day they will just shut down the operations for that day. These people are not wall street, who want to make money out of derivatives on top of derivatives, history has shown that CME plays on the farmer side, or the miner side on btc spectrum.
This is just my point of view, I might be wrong and bitcoin drops down to 1000 bucks 20 hours after im writing this, but who knows? let’s have a healthy discussion.

So you bought at 11k and you are freaking now I assume. Just hold on and keep watching the market, learn from it, there are people going nuts selling their coins now, there are also people like me who are waiting for bitcoin to “crash” so I can buy more. Hold on buddy, hold on.

its not about what you think the government is, its about what it really is, do you REALLY think they care about any of us? they want their share and that’s it. This talk is beautiful but come on! Of course it represents industries, of course it cares about status quo and maintaining it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:37
Oh, great! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:37:39
forget about the amount you bought in dollars, how many bitcoins you have? 0,00005352648? just multiple it for the projected bitcoin value and subtract your hundred bucks.

“Coinbase boasts nearly 6 million customers, but according to a government filing, fewer than 1,000 US citizens have reported cryptocurrency holdings on their taxes.”

Bitcoin is a decentralized currency,  anyone can propose changes, but it is up to us (market) and miners to approve the coin and give it value or not, if you don’t like these coins just don’t buy them.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:58:47
as harsh as it may sound, this is true.
