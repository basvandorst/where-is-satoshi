umm nobody is probably thinking about biology here...There’s now a lot more exciting stuff to think about.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:49:59
You probably meant to say i don’t understand the hype?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:26:57

@_date: 2018-01-30 14:38:37
tether disaster is looming over the market...
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:08:27

@_date: 2018-09-09 18:21:05

whales playing with the market again
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:26:30
bitcoins primary purpose is to be a store of value. Also the more people that hodl the more scarce it will be on the market, hence the price goes up. it’s simple economics- see supply and demand curve. I don’t know how using it, would it make it more valuable. After all bitcoin can be divided almost infinitely lol. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 10:58:40
I always think about fiat car brand when I see word fiat. every single damn time.
@_date: 2018-08-05 11:02:42
lol if it wasn't for marcchione fiat company as such wouldn't even exist today. It would go bust couple years ago. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:59:03
well i’m selling so i can buy more when it crashes even more..
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:55:27
we’ve got a criminal here!
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:05:20
5270 december
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:50:16
about 90 %
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:20:41
bitcoin and stocks are sadly not inversely correlated
@_date: 2018-08-05 10:59:25
they still own Ferrari which is a pretty good substitute.
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:23:57
he has hauptschule which is something like high school 
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:49:31
it needs the hype we saw in november/december 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:37:40
the failed regime they have has to have control over all the money, so they can steal it anytime they want..
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:27:24
what does the dashed line represent?
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:21:00
Can please someone explain to me what’s happening to bitcoin fundamentally? is there any real progress happening. To me it just seems the same slow expensive electricity gobbling digital gold as it was 8 months ago... maybe i’m missing something? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:34:36
imo no.
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:21:27
wait for another week or two and the return will be -44%. What an idiotic thing to say lol
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:59:53
hope not but i think it will most likely happen 
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:47:10
the only difference is that back then there was nobody posting these memes since bitcoin hadn’t already gained worldwide attention. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:07:13
on december 2018 bitcoin will be selling at 6700 +- 2000 usd.  ....... or i will eat my dick
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:16:40
if you don’t know please stop trying to make others seem dumb. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:48:30
dream on my friend but the nasty truth is that market is screwed long term since btc dipped below 7700.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:22:07
they must be heavily invested hah
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:45:48
this is horrible disaster for bitcoin. it basically means china has the power to completely stop the evolution of bitcoin network altogether since it depends entirely on miners. sad 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:49:35
i’m in the identical position haha
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:57:19
sure you will but without any money though.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:51:41
if i’ve learned anything in my 9 months of being a participant in the crypto space is that TA is 90% total bullshit &amp; that nobody knows shit about where the price is gonna move, even if they sound smart lol.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:02:02
you’ve been punked!
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:04:21
and me and a quarter of my friends which are now in their twenties will be rich enough to retire lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:42:57
deleted coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:16:26
dude you're clearly in denial lol
@_date: 2018-11-18 09:31:41
what's for lunch today? nothing Bitcoin is still down 10%.
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:12:05
we’re in panic, a week ago we were in denial. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:55:02
c'mon man
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:55:45
fake news all the way 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:00:23
@_date: 2018-11-03 14:47:05
the best city on earth by far
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:20:32
I bet That's not it.
@_date: 2018-11-18 09:29:15
best app for learning anything. good bless those people. I benefited greatly from it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:06:34
i think 200 could be an absolute bottom. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:24:43
life hehe
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:55:36
shut your hole will ya. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:21:51
great job!
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:34:31
haha dude are you kidding me? the volume in bolivars is rising because the inflations is getting higher and higher lol!
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:54:43
south korea looks reasonable cheap place to mine.....not
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:21:22
i thought kinder eggs are illegal in the usa
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:40:36
yes the translation is exact.. he did not say “crypto” though, he was talking explicitly about blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:50:29
4500 - 6000 for JUNE that’s my take on it
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:54:55
you’re fired!
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:42:44
can it be even more obvious that it’s fake? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:21:56
still it’s way way easier to go from 2k to 5k than it is to go to 20k. The volume has to be 5x-10x bigger...
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:11:27
it's disgrace how much power over their government have rich people in India.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:07:50
don't worry about the EU  they probably won't do anything for at least the next 5 years. just take a look how long is it taking them to find out what to do with all the migrants haha. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:57:07
seems about right hah
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:33:20
why would you pay for anything...go to tradingview.com for future price predictions 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:53:39
you should’ve taken profits..if you didn’t then you’re probably better off hodling than selling at a loss.
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:22:08
relax he is in command of the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world and we're still kicking. he is one trustful man who stands by his words.
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:00:59
I know we have them in Slovenia too... we have both kinder surprise and whatever that thing with a spoon inside is...
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:24:52
long live putin!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:00:21
i am also accepting btc. When is this news coming out?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:13:55
I don't know exactly what are you trying to say but it seems that you're correlating being of great health to some kind of greater contribution to society? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:34:37
that's different... it can be reformed in a week if both parties agree... whereas in EU all the parties in a specific country have to agree and after that all the countries within the membership have to agree.. so yeah... takes a while let's say a year or three. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:43:02
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:52:51
i like euro. i absolutely despise exchanging currencies and having to constantly calculate how much things cost in eur.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:31:38
news are just not enough anymore.. it has to start happening too. imagine if stocks behaved like krypto do just because some unknown guy blabbered something to a local news nobody ever heard about.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:33:10
kiefer :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:31
the guy with exploded head is called tether. he didn't even get the chance poor guy.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:44:37
i’d be pretty close to being break even though 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:33:42
exactly BCC is now like seventh by marketcap.. I wouldn't be surprised if they add Tron next..
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:39:09
i bet 99.5 % folks invested in btc don’t have a clue and don’t give a shit about bitcoin as such and changing the financial system. If we did than we wouldn’t be converting our btc to fiat. for now it’s all about the profits. If bitcoin means a revolution even better but profits and lambos and mooning is now a priority.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:13:02
this chart makes me shit my pants every time 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:35:38
i’m starting to hate China by day to day even more than Trump does.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:11:17
always before i open delta i get a little adrenaline rush. So i just clench my teeth together and make this ttttsssss sound when i find out my portfolio is 20% down haha
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:30:15
haha do you really think your health mostly depends on what you eat and how much you run?? Tell that to millions of seemingly healthy thin people who get cancer, heart problems, autoimmune diseases etc. We are not cars. It’s mostly the genetics that decide on your health, lifestyle makes up maybe 30% at most. And i’m a scientist by the way.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:30:30
hahaha do you know how to get to the medical school?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:14:22
still only fear for me 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:45:04
I don't think you can still call it Panic selling.. it's more like get your shit together sell... 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:06:12
always warms my heart when i hear those kinds of news &amp; check to find out they’re true 
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:33:29
hahaha this must happened in China.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:51:00
Does anybody know how to immigrate to Belarus? I ain’t giving a cent. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:18:51
you mean the british pound?
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:35:58
yes Alessio rastani said that and it makes a lot of sense
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:42:50
I certainly hope
@_date: 2018-07-05 22:13:50
i want to get a fiat
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:29:38
well i just set my stop loss orders.. waiting to see what happens but i’m not going in minus 
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:33:13
you'll be saying the same thing in October.. just the other way around lol.. just wait
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:17:45
revolut, they even have some crypto options integrated 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:31:42
of course it's made up but it still goes along with the point I was trying to make. I'm stupid for even replying to such stupid ideas as his.
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:36:09
who on Earth still goes to the cinema?
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:48:00
but then again he went bankrupt couple of times...
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:46:16
the next time i’ll be thinking on buying more bitcoin will be when it reaches 3k... 
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:06:19
he dumb af
@_date: 2019-05-05 07:48:12
dude i guess you’re still a noob in this space...otherwise you’d know not to listen to that crap.
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:01:30
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:04:12
if you ask me now i definitely would, but if you asked me during the bull run i definitely wouldn’t.
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:00:11
because we’re still in denial
@_date: 2019-05-05 22:26:17
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:16:25
this is what vodka does to you...
