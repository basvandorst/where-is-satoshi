funny the statement doesn't mention insolvency

arbitrage is not possible because currently you can't transfer BTC out of Gox. You can however transfer out cash which is the reason for the sell pressure.

or just wait and either get 500% or nothing.

I replied but I read they only have limited support on the weekends so I'm not hopeful of any immediate action and I don't yet know if my funds were stolen. If they were it could mean their sent email is compromised and someone can access the reset keys. When I try the reset key that was sent the web page doesn't say anything, no error or nothing. I wasn't using 2fa.

Ok I did the password reset using my email and I got it instantly. Then I clicked the link set a new password and low and behold my funds are still there! Phew I agree its been a very stressful 24 hours or so.

I also got a password reset email this morning at 02:24:40 PM GMT and I can no longer access my account.

They are on the case and just got back to me. "We apologize for the inconvenience caused. We have disabled the withdrawals on the account and we are investigating further on this. We will keep you updated."

How did you reset your password? Did you follow the lost password method? I though the hacker had changed the email to their own though.
