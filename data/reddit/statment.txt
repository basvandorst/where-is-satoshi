See ya there.

I'm talking about setting up an infrastructure where it elevates poverty. Not some Universal Basic Income like Andrew Yang suggest.

I could do another week. Been hodling since 2016 so....
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:48:08
Rather have the Bitcoin equivalent rn. But I appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:18:26
I already offer an extra 10% off when buying with Bitcoin in-store. We get so few bitcoin transactions that it doesn’t affect us at all. We just want adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:15:12
It’s a complex relationship, I feel the same way.
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:56:00
All praise Satoshi
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:47:04
They’re for sale, to feed my bitcoin enthusiasm.

Gravity....keep falling?

I have a weekly buy on Coinbase every Monday at 9:00am pst so I say it’ll hit $15,000, then drop back to $9,500 at 9:02am pst.

I was just in Vegas. Aria Crystal has one too.
@_date: 2019-07-26 05:14:17
It’s by the restroom where the Starbucks is near Mastros!
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:43:27
Oh word? I shit skittles.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:00:24
I like that plan best. Also a human dart board would be cool.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:02:18
We offer a discount if you pay with Crypto so it basically balances out.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:34:41
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:10:04
The people who pay with crypto are well aware of transactions fees. The pamphlet gives the basics on Crypto, it’s to peek their curiosity. They can always do their own research since I’m not a financial advisor.

Go all in. The proof is in the charts.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:45:06
Got my popcorn, enjoying the ride. Should make for a good story in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:46:46
My mom still thinks it’s an actual coin. Wrong generation I guess.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:05:11
Enough to say “back in my days .1 got you a cup of coffee” or something along those lines.
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:39:36
See ya there in a couple years! They got a Panda Express so we’re good.
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:58:30
Your hesitation to buy means you'll sell when the price drops 5%. HODL, it's that simple. Invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:46:18
Definitely “nrgative”
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:44:29
Let the financial system crumble, Bitcoin is a revolution.
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:15:45
Priorities change.

Stat-Ment, near the food court. Come by!
@_date: 2019-07-30 22:52:55
Just trying to do our part. A lot of inquiries.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:41:45
I'm thinking 50K+ 
I feel we'll hit 20K by October and continue to ride up from there.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:46:25
If only the markets can do the same.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:05:09
I’m down for a million dollar bitcoin, but I’m just gonna hodl and continue to hodl. That’s the name of the game.
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:08:08
How does that make you feel....that’ll be 0.67 btc
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:28:51
Go ahead and buy it when it hits $100,000 &amp; you feel more confident about it. You either see the vision and where we’re headed or you don’t. But eventually you’ll be looking back &amp; realizing that your hesitation caused you big profits. 
Guys back in 2010 never thought it’ll hit $20k but look what happened. The dips hurt at first but we always bounce back. Bitcoin is going nowhere!
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:15:18
Definitely gonna read it, just watched a short documentary and WOW! Makes me more Bullish on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:39:10
I use BitPay for my online and then for my I retail just have customers send it direct to my Coinbase. Note: No one really pays with it online and in-store it's just so they can record a $10 transaction and send it to their friends.

This dude chills at Starbucks with CoinMarketCap open on his laptop talking about Fibonacci patterns.
@_date: 2019-07-26 02:31:46
Whatcha planning on having for dinner?
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:55:58
Say it again. I got goosebumps.
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:54:52
He’s not doing anything. Let him tweet and eat some fried chicken. We’re golden.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:41:41
Men’s clothes, I’m always in and out but feel free to stop by.
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:38:59
Can't promise I'll be there but check it out!
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:33:45
Seems legit Lol
@_date: 2019-08-02 04:38:55
It’s pretty spot on.
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:45:42
I’m okay with Bitcoin not hitting $1M by the end of 2020. I wonder what wine pairs well with penis.
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:09:19
Bitcoin is my insurance for the recession
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:53:54
How so? What’s your logic on the price dropping?
