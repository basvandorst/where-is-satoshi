I'm talking about the advanced marksmanship courses. Though not as basic, still not that advanced either. Shoot at 1000 meters in that course with an acog. It's a series of 3 classes that you must do in order. Advanced marksmanship, pistol course, and long range.

They work that part into the law somehow from what I've been told. Like you can do the exchange if you can make judgement on wether you think they are a felon or not. Sounds crazy but I do believe its true, no source though.

That's what I'm saying. I didn't get a single thing for 5 minutes. And I was just watching the other guy on his phone and really didn't know what he was doing as is never done it. And I wasn't going to let him leave with my stuff trusting that it's in the system or whatever.

Yes indeed open carry open Uhmm.... Exchange? Can't seem to think of the correct word. Now from a dealer you still get background checks. But public to public is legal.

Yes I was using the blockchain app on my phone.

Infinite money combo?

Yep I watched him confirm and it took 5 to get a text and 3 minutes later I received in my wallet

Hmm I wonder how it got through and the link send me directly to block chain website. Oh well, looks like I'll continue to dream.

It was decent. No one is worried about weapon bans anymore so I couldn't fetch anymore if I tried anytime in the near future I imagine. Didn't need to sell it but I didn't feel the need to hold onto it either.

What kind of fees will I be looking at? Say 1 bitcoin at 800 dollars, how much amazon cash can I obtain? I'd imagine somewhere along the lines of 750 or something

You know you can attach a scope to an ak47 right? Does no one understand this? Also some of the most basic army training is marksmanship and hitting targets up to 700m away. And I'm talking about s1 and regular joes, not trained snipers by any means.
