The ideal cryptocurrency would have the following properties: fast transactions, the best possible security (that can be enhanced over time as hackers learn new ways to beat it), stable store of value, requires little infrastructure to maintain, and is easy to use.  Bitcoin fails virtually all of these tests.

He's right to be worried.  Cryptocurrencies could upend our present financial order, and despite what the hardcore anarchists say here, the result may not be something desirable.
Canada's central bank has a very good reputation in the public eye.  We did not have quantitative easing here in Canada after the 2008 crash.  People trust the banking system here.  
It seems one thing people ignore is that if the economy moves to a significant degree towards cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange, a lot of information about the economy vanishes, since governments can't track it.  It also means governments can't protect people during a recession, since they can't alter interest rates on bitcoin, on print more bitcoin to stimulate the economy during a recession.  
We did have deflationary currencies before central banks.  The result was that recessions lasted longer and cut deeper.  If the money supply contracts, as they can during a recession with no inflationary currency with no central bank, then people simply don't have money to hire the mass unemployed, or to invest in a new business.

Friedman has been proven wrong more than most economists of his day.

2013 peak (Nov. 29 2013): $1 104.07.  Value right now (1473 days later): $16 700.  So that's $10.59 per day on average in value increase.

This is what we mean by bitcoin having no backing:
If my bank goes bankrupt, my money is insured by the government.  I don't lose any of it.
If someone hacks my bitcoin wallet, and I lose my bitcoins, I get nothing.  No recourse.
How can you call yourself an economist and not grasp such a basic concept?  It's all about risk, and bitcoin is loaded with it.  Regular currencies are not.  If you want to protect yourself against inflation, buy gold.  It won't be replaced by a newer, sexier precious metal in a few years.

Which is exactly why no one uses fax machines anymore.
