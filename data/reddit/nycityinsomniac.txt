Damn you're an amazing person! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:05:40
Let’s get rich 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:16:18
Shorting bitcoin is retarded. Good luck with it
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:36:49
its already over 16k. wtf are you talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:01:52
Yes I’m buying 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:40:31
People having their hands on your money, obviously
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:02:01
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:38:15
I’ll never let go 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:02:53
Good for you bro 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:56:07
Your friend is a sheep with no blockchain knowledge 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:20:25
It will increase awareness of bitcoin which will bring more volume. I never said it would come from selling more bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:50:51
lmfao 
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:30:17
Me too haha it was awesome! I’m excited ������
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:05:24
The power of control over our own money. Do you seriously not understand that this is what it is about? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:34:12
Why sell everything for BTC? Some people bought other coins for pennies and they could prob make a lot more if those coins take off. This is poor advice 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:55:12
Absolute Boom
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:25:34
An original idea was Atari. I don’t see them around anymore. That doesn’t make Nintendo a scam ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:43:37
We are already taking some power back and if you don’t see that you’re blind. The people who really believe in this with hold through this. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:00:16
Now put your hand in your mouth 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:23:12
This is awesome! We’ve come too far to only come this far 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:06:33
Why with a market cap that is so high, does it take so long for them to implement this? This is a serious question. I'm ignorant on the subject. 
Wouldn't that give them enough money to hire the right kind of people to implement such a thing? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:09:04
I don’t mean to be a dick but bitcoin is only so valuable because of the name at this point. It might not even be a top dawg one day because there are alt coins that operate much better.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:58:02
The price is slowly going back up. Goodbye all the people who couldn’t grab their balls 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:51:58
While I agree with you and I own bitcoin, its only a name and a scarcity that makes it valuable. Other Alt coins clearly outperform it! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:41:22
That’s actually 33k sir 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:11:35
Haha that’s just gonna hurt the value of it. Litecoin is superior and it was only riding on the bitcoin name 
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:43:47
Maybe an exuberant amount of exchanges at once. Hopefully we keep climbing this time 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:24
I saw this bro. I hope we are good lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:47:00
Congrats let’s gooo
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:55:06
I didn’t want Hillary to win. You’re arrogant and you jump to conclusions. You must be fun at parties 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:03:08
No they didn’t 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:49
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:29:27
Fuck yeah let’s do this! Hopefully litecoin follows for me 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:16:11
No I’m an owner of bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:56:39
I’m not liberal, I’m independent. You know the smarter kind 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:02:55
This is not considered a crash
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:50:08
Arrogance 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:31:05
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:13
Let’s gooooooo ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:25
Get bit or die tryin 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:07:10
Dude stop acting like a hot shot. I literally looked at your posts from 13 days ago saying you couldn’t even afford bitcoin. Lol have fun with your bitcoin and a half ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:19:08
hell ya 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:23:49
Lmao 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:21:52
I’m either hodling or buying more. Most likely buying more 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:13:28
I’m sorry I don’t feel bad for stupid shit like this. Either believe In the product or don’t
