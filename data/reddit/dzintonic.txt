Thank you for the support. Because I know a thing or two about court practices, there is no point in filing a legal action against them. There just isn't enough court practice on the subject for the judges to make solid decisions. Publicity on the experience is the only thing I have with this.

The thing that bugs me the most is their arrogance. Even after it was clear that the private keys haven't been destroyed, but added to someones active wallet. I still tried to find a peaceful solution, just pay what is right and let's forget that this has happened. I even offered them 15% penalty for my mistake to pay for any extra work needed in transferring back. But they had absolutely 0 interest in finding a solution even if I told them multiple times that I will make this case public. To do all of this over this amount of money is beyond my understanding. My only guess is that they are just so used to people leaving it as it is.

In a short reply. The coins started moving and this is already written in my original post.

I agree that I probably got scammed, I doubt that someone will offer me a solution from their ranks. They seem quite confident on the subject and just don't care. Publicity is the only thing. To make their life just a little harder and to warn others about their business ethics.

I transferred BTC to them, and BTC can't be charged back :( Both the virtue and the flaw of crypto :)
