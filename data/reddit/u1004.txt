what exactly did the devs have to do, to protect against segwit 2x? 
And what do the miners have to do with any of this?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:45:40
gonna need some sauce pal
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:50:00
any idea how long before the RC turns into a real version?
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:54:59
hahahah lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:25:32
how much more scaling will this increase bring to bitcoin? what if someone responds, that BCash has 8mb blocksize  and therefore scales more..?
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:14:51
HEY HEY HEY......
HEY HEY HEY...
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:42:59
Just buy and hodl, and walk away.  don't worry about the swings.  Your instincts are right, time to act on them before you miss any more gains.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:05:40
The futures are cash-settled, so i doubt the expiry will mean anything for btc's price

I thought the size of a block is fixed -- it's only mined when its full of tx.....
Can someone please help explain what i'm missing? And how is this incentive structure different than eth?? I've been reading about tx fees for a couple days trying to wrap my head around it.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:28:01
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:00:24
are you ok?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:55:02
you have no idea how close that is to reality.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:21:13
i got in at 6.4k. i'm riding this bad boy to $0 or the moon. the dumps are stressful, but i don't care anymore. i'll consider cashing out at 100k. but if there's any pace to the growth at 100k, i'll just hodl until i'm old and gray
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:01:59

Yes, finding the hash that meets the criteria (nonce, difficulty, etc) is the proof of work. But....ah ok, the difficulty is adjusted such that regardless of how much computing power there is...
But every 10 minutes seems like a long time. Especially, because 7 tx per second is low and this slow processing speed is partly why the mempool got so congested (yes, also due to spam). But the high fees are partly due to basically supply and demand...but if there was more supply (i.e., the blocks didn't get as full), i guess the miners wouldnt  be so demanding. sorry for the rambling, it's late but i desperately want to figure this stuff out.

care to define what "average rate of return" might be? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:06:00
not looking good buddy
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:46:34
this. he did not inhale
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:49:35
That was apparent from the beginning. You're more interested in "\*sigh\*"s, scare quotes, and other flourishes. I think my initial question ("average rate of return") was fair enough, as nobody knows what the fuck that means without context.
Three times i pointed out that evidence for a 40-year timescale producing equivalent rates of returns is pretty low. Year over year it's fine, but that's not what OP was referring to. For every year you look ahead into the future, your confidence interval becomes wider and the likelihood for a 7% return becomes narrower. As I said before and which you cuntily evaded, this is basic statistics.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:50:19
I understand that figure is thrown around a lot, but I would not rely upon it too much if I were you.
@_date: 2018-09-13 20:02:16
honestly though, they underpaid him. by a lot. they're a fucking bank
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:12:28
I know what "real" meant, so let's say my point about inflation is moot. Do you have any non-snarky answer to my point about n=3?
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:10:54
(1) inflation
(2) whatever the average is, the 40year tiime scale has like 3-4 observations. listen i hope it continues but in 40-years i wouldn't bet much on inflation-adjusted returns for index investing. let's hope i'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:08:17
On a 40-year time scale, you have about 3 observations to back up your hypothesis that a 7% return rate is easily achieved (assuming you throw everything into index funds). THAT is a fact, and therefore there is little evidence to support your claim.

Whats your favorite plane site? I'm fond of CLT, they have some good restaurants. EWR has a huge food court. SDF has a couple of nice bourban bars.
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:32:21
Compelling argument.
I just dont fully understand the link between these futures and direct price, since they're cash-settled.
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:27:30
At your level of investment, have you considered using a custodial service?

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:06:34
100,000k i might consider selling. only have one though, so if it has promise to reach 1,000,000 i'll sell it then.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:02:04
potentially. govt regulation also legitimizes it, so will let more conservative investors and institutions more comfortable with getting involved.

@_date: 2017-11-01 15:50:15
I want to pose kinda the opposite question -- what is the likelihood of btc going to near-0?
i.e., that it'll completely crash and go the way of a dead shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:20:18
This actually makes me sad. it means i can never be a bitcoin millionaire because i only have one.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:52:36
hodl long term. think years, not days or weeks. look at the price graph on a yearly scale.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:21:28
fuck me, 10,730
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:58:23
I mean, it's getting increasingly hard to. Even assuming the price stays flat, it's not easy to get together $7300 to buy a btc.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:51:14
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:48

Yes, that's how it feels to spend with fiat too (instead of letting it grow interest). Next?

It's a SegWit party baby! Let's set back and wait for 50% adoption, while BTC pushes 11k.

@_date: 2018-04-06 13:19:54
seriously though -- if you have experience in the financial industry and crypto, please share your sources on the claim. I have first hand knowledge of institutions holding btc. would love to see how your sources contradict mine.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:32:42
How much was it?
