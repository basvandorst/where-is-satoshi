On the surface, it appears like a man-in-the-middle or scam. But ... my personal BTC wallet has that address as an account, and I see that address still has the coins, 1 transaction in, 0 out. I have the PGP proof-of-ownership but I don't see a way to connect it to that address. If it's a scam, it seems like they're not very good at it, or else they'd have the BTC already.
I'm leaning toward error on their side, or a bug.

No, it's the only transaction that shows for that address. Although the address was supposed to be good for 7 days, it changed after 2 days, and only after I sent the BTC.
It \*sounds\* fishy. On the other hand, I go to mirrors of that site, that smart people swear up and down are legit, and the site in question has the exact same info on it (e.g., my account, messages). So it looks like this site is as legit as the others. (Either they're all phishing -- unlikely -- or this is a phishing site that has accessed the real deal.)

No, the coins are there. I see them. If I were scamming someone, I would have absconded with them posthaste.
But there they are.
I don't know what I was thinking. In the past I always sent small first.

Oh sure. Totally agree. I'm only saying that my sources, plural, all seem to know a lot more about this stuff than I do (give it time). Put together with high scores and an overall vibe that they are sincerely trying to help people, and not just push links, I think the links they do provide are, indeed, generally trustworthy. (A couple even post here about how not to lose your $. I don't think they all know each other or even talk. It's a stretch to say they are ALL trying to screw me. (1 or 2 yeah, but ALL?))
The site in question has the exact stuff as the ones "generally" regarded as legit, down to my username, PGP sig, everything. So, either they're all fake or they're all real. For that reason, I'm not convinced I've been scammed. I'm not convinced I wasn't scammed either. I don't know WTF.
\*Also, by "generally trustworthy," I don't mean it's gospel. I'm only saying that advice given by a knowledgeable dude, in a public forum, with a ton of karma and upvotes from not-spam accounts, when he doesn't have an obvious angle, makes him either honest (in the context of Reddit), or a scammer par excellence.
