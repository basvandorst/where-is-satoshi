From translate:
Payment Provider Mollie , who a few weeks ago has integrated bitcoin payments in its new service lets customers automatically accept bitcoin payments , according to a survey of the company . If these companies do not want this , they will have to disable the option itself ( "opt - out") , rather than the other ( " opt-in " ) .
Because Mollie every month eight hundred new businesses connect to its payment system , taking the total number of Dutch webshops that accept bitcoin rapidly. At present it is already possible via Mollie at about nine hundred Dutch companies to pay . With bitcoin Since a company can operate more websites , the total number of online shops that accept even higher than that. Mollie through bitcoins will
Companies already using the service Mollie before bitcoin payments were integrated , accept the cryptographic currency not automatically . They can, however, enable this option , according to an opt-in system so . An estimated two hundred companies have already done so - which means that bitcoin integration with the other seven hundred (out of nine ) companies automatically. It is not currently known which customers Mollie exactly make use of this service .
The number of bitcoin payments via Mollie was carried on still very low: Since its introduction , there are at most ten bitcoin payments made ​​through the payment provider .
