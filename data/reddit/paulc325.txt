Cleaning toilets is not a profession.  Perhaps 'professional in his field' was the wrong wording.  But he is not a plumber who is creating the regulation.  He is a professional regulator. - not to say he will regulate correctly.
I don't see where I put Lawsky on a pedestal.

Do i have to pay to view this?  or just log in?  
Either way it is stupid.
Thanks for the link anyways.

Being Bitcoin businesses, it is great to see them step-up to the plate.  Thank you for being well managed businesses.  Much respect

In my opinion; it is the lack of communication that has gotten Mt.Gox into this hole.  Not the withdrawal halt.
Yes, there is FUD.  And, it is well granted.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:32:33
Yes, this is great...
But, how awesome would it be if Apple just made Bitcoin a native experience in iOS.  And Made the iPhone into the most secure hardware wallet for Bitcoin.
There is an idea, Apple.

Volume is low still.  
Verification was completed same day as registration.
Customer support has been fantastic.
First transaction was completed within 36 hrs of initial signup.  Bank transfer and all.
Check it out!

I never specified.

Maybe if you boil the iPhone it tenderizes it?
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:45:31
Maybe you could slice it into strips using a band saw, the deepfry them, you could dip the sticks into ketchup.  Maybe if the iPhone Fries are fresh, simply salting them would suffice.

Write them down?  (and hide them).
It would be so so so stupid for me to rely on my brain to remember the probably 30+ passwords I have for various websites.  
Some people say its insecure to write passwords down.  I feel the opposite way.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:39:33
Thank you

Yes, but a nice, Centralized online money...  Isn't that what we want?... lol
Seriously though, who will trust their wealth to a company with no Financial history. and that bombards its users with advertisements (a personal pet pieve).

Overstock.com Overstock began accepting Bitcoin in January 2013 and has had over $1 million in Bitcoin sales.
I believe this is an error.  2014 is more correct.  :)
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:06:53
Thats great!  Litecoin is awesome.-as is BTC :)  You should contact some of the exchanges and get them on board.  Maybe they'd start getting apps ready.  
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:17:19
Definitely.  He is not just an immature person like some of the r/bitcoiners.  He is a professional in his field, and while I feel people do not 'deserve' respect (it must be earned), nobody should be disrespected.
I hope only intellectual individuals bother asking questions during the AMA.

Some debit cards run on the credit card networks.  Visa, for example.  I am not sure if the fees are the same though.

As well as make them convenient, fun, usable/easy, and fancy.
All important things for technology to grab society's attention.

Sorry we don't all have piles of Bitcoins.  
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:10:53
Being neutral to dogecoin, this is pretty darn accurate.  Very funny.  Good job!
EDIT:   wow.  much reply.  such good.  WOW.
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:49:25
interesting.   
Probably in the future we will see more companies adopt mBTC then?
or maybe not lol.

Here it says that January 31 will be China's last day.
Keep in mind that nobody seems to be clear on what China is actually up to.

But yes, BBQ iPhone could be nice. ;)

So do the Individuals running a mining rig have some sort of a graphical interface?  Showing a list of pending transactions?   I have set up mining before, but this is something I am confused about also.  My little experience with mining did not explain this.

People always complain they can't have a Million dollars...
 
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:42:41
the best bitcoin exchange. period.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:07:43
are you able to post the japanese symbol(s) for "bitcoin"
please and thanks
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:36:27
I was merely thinking that it might be a barrier to entry for some, that the exchange rate is the way it is.  Where as, if they could get many bitcoins per dollar, they would be much more willing.

I thought it was the Founder?

I remember when I was using QT a few months back.  It took a long time to catch up.  Far longer than anybody quoted on the internet.

Oh, did you know Steve?
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:16:42
we support you on reddit my friend.  I hope you report this to the police.  it has become more than a scam.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:35:25
I was not aware of their potential plans to open an online trading exchange.  As viewsauce pointed out that there are.

This is the equivalent to asking a musician selling his music in an iTunes equivalent : 
What equipment did you record on?  What did you have the Tone, Bass, Treble, Reverb etc. set at?  Please provide receipts for all of your cables, mics, amps, guitars, pics, drums, etc. so that we know you aren't receiving your music from the music launderer
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:29:30
i second this.
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:43:31
Maybe would have been smart to start this in a normal semester time.  So uni students are done exams, and can begin a new course...
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:57:28
hahaha this is great.
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:31:18
my post has been updated.  It was merely put up for discussion.  I have account history, though it is all private messaging.  I am not somebody here on a mission to change bitcoin.

Thanks for posting on here Big_Vern, and being part of our community.
And thank you SeansOutpost.

I am very excited about this exchange.
Signed up today.  Verification completed today.
I am now just waiting for my funds to transfer in.
I have done business with Bitcoiniacs in the past, and it has always been enjoyable.
I can't wait to start on Cointrader.net
Way to go Canada!

This is great.
Note from a long-time jailbreaker; 
Jailbreaking is fantastic.  Be careful when you do it though, as I have heard many stories of things going wrong.  For me though, all jailbreaks have succeeded.
Nowadays, jailbreaking is so simple thanks to Evasi0n.
I was getting bumed by Apple's actions towards Bitcoin.
Thanks for the reminder about Jailbreaking!
