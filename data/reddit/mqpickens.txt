Stop orders and forced margin calls. Whales are expert at fleecing them and making some good profit in just a few minutes.
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:09:43
Yes yes and yes!
Similar to the cent symbol that is written at the end, I use the $ symbol at the end to denote $atoshis.   
Example, 
 $1.00 = 100¢ ~ 10000$ 
People are catching on!

More and more people will wise up and stop day trading.  They will dollar cost average and hodl for the the long haul. The number of participants and the market cap will grow. This will weaken the ability for any one entity to manipulate the price. Be patient.

Not necessarily. If Turing completness is proven sufficiently useful, it's only a matter of time (years of course) before full integration with bitcoin.

Bias much? A side chain can be just as ground up as any other project and without creating yet another coin. I think that is something a lot of people are interested in. "ridiculous fees" .... now your just FUDing.

An honest monetary system (Bitcoin) would neuter all these shenanigans from taking place.

Using $at here. That is cool though.
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:00:56
Who suggested using the $ as a postfix? That seems the best.

Bootstrapping an honest decentralised monetary system onto the global stage takes time. It will get better and boring. Those that adopt it as their monetary base early on are being rewarded with a strong long term uptrend.

That's the point, they are all (99%) being used just like bitcoin making their existence rather meaningless.

@_date: 2019-08-08 04:01:19
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:01:53
Just start cost averaging in over the coming months. It's the best way to go.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:14:13
In the years to come, Bitcoin will be trading much higher. It will continue to do its thing. Then come the reddit post mourning the fact they bought at 10k and sold at 6k, but only if the HOLD'ed they will say.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:10:59
True, however, my post was geared more towards those that don't actively trade. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:52:38
Just let us know when you sell... That will be the bottom :-)

Lighting channels are channels that don't require trust. Soon, someone will innovate and allow other types of channels where small loans can be done between trusted peers. The social network it will create will give birth to a whole new dimension of decentralization. Can't wait!

No worries, bitcoin is kicking them out of the basket once they are done helping :-)
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:44:11
The adoption is real.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:17:37
You make it sound like 1k is a lot for you. If it is a low percentage of your savings and investments then your too focused on potentially a small loss. If it is money you can't afford to lose then cash out some, but never all. Keep between 50 and 200.
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:49:07
This is good stuff! The network should incorporate trustless connections and trusting.

I appreciate your level headed comment that doesn't have a shill feel. I desire a smart contact side chain more integrated into bitcoin than rsk. Will see what developers and the consensus bring our way. I still think the op service is more about demonstrating micro payments. If they run with the money then who cares.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:00:37
Interesting question. As long as sufficient number of people stay educated, vigilant, and don't hold their satodhis on the exchanges, it will be hard for them too.

My goals, Wait for the price to trade sideways for a few months. Buy as much bitcoin as possible each paycheck.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:05:55
Good luck, but maybe stage it a bit. Yeah, with a long term perspective, these prices are an awesome buy. Bitcoin will continue to do it's thing.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:33:19
tl;dr - OP wants to unload his fiat bags @ $6,000/BTC. He needs your help. Stop Buying!

And? Been lurking for longer ;-)
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:09:51
Wow. All these comments are telling the story that we are truly close to the "bottom".
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:27:59
Stop they say.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:18:34
At some point you need to realize that if it's not bitcoin it will lead to endless speculation to one coin to the next to the next to the next to the next... Bitcoin will eventually figure out a way to find consensus for innovation.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:12:14
Personal thoughts: there is a good chance we are in the bottom area, maybe just wishful thinking, but I think each bitcoin bubble is going to have a smaller and smaller retracement in terms of percent. 2011 bubble had a 90% retracement. 2014 was around 82% (if I recall correctly) and currently we are at 70% from the last ATH. I'm emotionally prepared for it to go to around 76% (~4700); more than that I'll be looking for someone to hold my hand as well. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:26:41
Nah, anything worthwhile out there will eventually be done with bitcoin. Buy bitcoin for the long haul, scratch your speculative itch with some alt coins.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:26:09
Seems legit
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:35:16
Good stuff, but may not be the best strategy to win.

I have came to somewhat the same conclusion. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:16:52
Roger Ver, a prominent individual in the space, had a narcissistic rage quit because the community didn't follow his way of thinking. A portion of the community followed him and now they have their bcash. Bcash's creation was also highly beneficial to Bitmain (owns a large portion of the hash rate) so they were big supporters. Their community, r/btc, is hell bent on bitcoin's demise. They constantly hail satoshi as a god while misconstruing much of what he has written. Bcash may be good for short term speculation and gains, but I would defiantly shy away from any long term holdings.

General namespace for bitcoin with simple dpki is an overlooked very important application that needs adopted at the first layer by all bitcoin nodes and miners.
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:38:29
This is absolutely right.  I'm glad that mind set is being challenged. They say it is open source,  which is true,  but firmware updates still depend on the boot loader which is preinstalled.  If a manufacture wanted to exit scam there is some pretty creative ways to do so.
@_date: 2019-08-10 20:39:47
No such thing as alt capitulation.  Just a bunch of shills wiping their butts after taking a dump. They are called  poo coins for a reason... good luck.

This is an interesting question as POS is rarely considered in this context. Imo, it would be difficult. It would be more volatile.

@_date: 2017-11-22 21:51:05
Yip... Let's just keep it simple. 
The use of Keystickers requires trust in its creator.
This creator would prefer that everyone only use keys (Desktop, mobile, paper, or hardware wallets) they created themselves with software they audited. Until then.......Keystickers.
 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:01:15
Ok, your upset, but saying I was lying is a bit of a stretch. If anything, communicating the exact nature of the product is/was my goal. The "vaugness" was from my weakness in communicating. I've heard everyone's comments and the project is being scrapped. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:01:24
Yes, I hear you. I wouldn't want you to use it either unless you felt you needed too. This is for the many that would find it difficult to securely create and manage their own keys.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:15:33
Patience my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:38:20
Completely agree. It's great you make your own wallet. Unfortunately, most people coming into Bitcoin will never make their own private keys let alone audit the tools that do. Most everyone is relying on somebody to some extent. The few that don't, I respect and this product will most likely not interest them. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:22:39
Maybe someone will volunteer a remake? Thanks for checking it out.
@_date: 2019-06-19 04:25:13
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:48:32
Love it! Hope you throw in alts, stocks, commodities, etc. in there as well. You priced them in $ats.... This is perfect.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:10:05
THANKS! And thanks for the review.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:09:40
Sorry you are angry; I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. Just providing more options. I'm very familiar with all the resources out there including bitcoinpaperwallets. If only we could get all the newcomers to educate themselves on proper key creation and management and take the time to do so but it just isn't happening anytime soon and people want into Bitcoin now!; this will hopefully be a stepping tool in that direction. I am considering "Keystickers version 2" that will address this most important concern, but I would rather say nothing more of that right now. 
@_date: 2019-10-02 04:43:40
More like shill tokens....
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:41:56
Yes, The private keys were generated, laser etched, covered with a holographic sticker, then deleted.
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:26:07
 This market is cyclical. Many people are experiencing similar emotions. When enough people cave to these emotions it is known in market terms as capitulation. In the same way the price gets overblown during a bull run, the price is now becoming oversold. Hope you find the mental and emotional peace you are looking for.
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:34:16
It was a small group. For my level of talent (when it comes to presenting), I would say I did alright.

Yes and yes. The project is being scrapped. Kickstarter will be turned off tonight. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:35:26
Yes, they contain private keys. They are concealed with the security holographic sticker. They are generated with multiple hardware truly random generators....a little overkill, but it gives me peace of mind. They are etched with a laser.

@_date: 2017-11-22 21:44:53
I don't expect anything. Trust is not something you can ask for. Trust is freely given to Desktop, mobile, and hardware wallets without question, but there are still opportunities for theft. Do you here of people compiling open source firmware and programming their hardware wallets? In other words, your criticism is valid, but disproportionate.

So far, it looks like there are some work arounds to see bits and pieces of the code. The best I've seen so far. I do appreciate the link; however, a more detailed guide would be useful. I'm not familiar with ST mcu nor python. I could sure use some help if you have truly done this already. May I ask questions along the way? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:46:16
Nah. Looks good the way it is.
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:59:04
Me too please
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:08:26
Wow. This was real disingenuous and a misdirection from the original topic. It was about being able to verify the firmware shipped with a trezor matches it's open source version. I have not found anyone that has done it.  
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:50:19
Exactly. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:03:21
Me too sorry...I'm a little edgy. Have a great day.
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:25:55
    Still waiting for someone to show me the way. I made a post in the trezor sub. Please feel free to add.

Yes. You are right. I need to work that wiki. Any idea on how to do so? Never done it before.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:08:08
Paper wallets are not obsolete. The editor got to fill that page with all his biases. It needs fixed. If you look at the edit history, those changes were very unpopular.
@_date: 2019-01-20 02:57:10
You have to erase parts of the flash (if not all) to be able to do this. If it was that easy, it would also be easily hackable. Is there not a step by step guide? this is my question?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:59:32
Let Ether pass the market cap. It's a short sighted perspective for that to be the only metric. Ether's increasing value is its own worst enemy to its long term success. Ether people at some point will just jump to the next big perceived great idea. In the end, it's hard to justify creating a new asset for every new piece of tech. Bitcoin is advancing and will always continue to advance. Just not at the pace most would like.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:45:59
Ok, first question. If it is possible to verify a trezor shipped from Satoshilabs in fact, beyond a shadow of a doubt, has the exact open source version freely availble online then why is there no write up that others could duplicate? If there is one, please point the way and I'll humbly apologize for being an "ass". If it's not available, yet it really is possible, then let's make that guide. Fair enough?
@_date: 2019-01-19 03:16:39
The fact that this keeps coming up shows that part of the community disagrees. Looks like the Bitcoin wiki needs a more unbiased rewrite.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:21:32
Backed by experience. Very useful!
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:33:32
You can't fully independently verify that your trezor device is using the open source code. There's still a huge element of trust.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:41:17
Ok. Thanks maestro.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:14:03
That much power in such a few hands is a very serious problem. At the very least, the discussion needs to stay active and ongoing; Or just rename bitcoin to bitmain.
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:38:37
It all depends on what is trying to be accomplished. Yes, they are better. Ideally, everyone would have there own hardware wallet that they themselves have personally audited.
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:38:40
You call that a guide. Thanks but no thanks.

It has it's place. It's not out dated.
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:58:57
Open source software wallets that are well known are inherently the most trust worthy (e.g.. Bitcoin node software), but it is only as secure as you make it. Hardware wallets are both secure and convenient, but you are trusting the manufacture and distribution channels.
@_date: 2019-01-19 23:35:36
Cool. Is there a guide?. I would like to do it my self.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:32:25
We'll just have to let history tell the story. But you did hit the nail on the head for the euthereum hype. It has allowed software engineers a platform to express their stong need, passion,  and drive to develop. This is important to note. Their enthusiasm for their work has overflowed to the multitude unwitty pumpers behind them. But their is so much more than just the tech' in a crypto ecosystem. Today, eth' is king of the alts, but tommorow another challenger will emerge. Then how do you justify to the many outsiders that are bag holding with your promises?
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:12:15
Yes, Bitcoin adopting a simple namespace protocol coupled with DPKI would be monumental. This guy gets it. Im in full support!!! This is definately layer 1 material.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:56:29
The FUD potential is big with this one. Satoshi or no satoshi, Bitcoin tech' speaks for itself. It is where it is at and it is where I'm staying regardless the price.

Thanks for the dialog. Have a good night.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:08:18
All I'm really saying is at some point, the industry will mature enough to realize the folly in creating yet another investment choice just because of some new innovation. I'm thankful for ether, there has been a lot learned. I just wouldn't recomend any long term hodling/investing, especially to people outside the industry.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:49:15
Ether is not going to crash, but it will forever be just an "alt coin". It's hard to justify creating a new investment vehicle for every piece of new tech that comes out. That mentality is rekt'ed.

It exists, pm me for details. It is on github, but lacks more peer review so that if can be trusted. Please thoroughly audit it yourself before using. I have not made it public yet. Just not ready for the onslaught of criticism for making a paper wallet generator. It is written in Java. Cheers.

Yes. They can do an exit scam! The amount of 3rd party checks is way too small any one raising valid issues will be ignored by the majority. The Mases don't like uncomfortable truths and just hit the ignore button.

For people that do not want to trust trezor or ledger, paper wallets are a good alternative. This is why they are not going away anytime soon. It would be nice of this niche market was served rather than condemned.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:58:28
This is good. Thanks OP
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:02:47
It's all relative to what you can afford to invest. 1 coin for a lot of people is a year of living tight. I can't recommend enough the discipline of DCA into bitcoin over a long period of time. Yes it's a great time to start. Best of luck.

Paper wallets are still being created. They are still being used. Rather than condescending articles, would it not be better to simply educate and let the users decide for themselves?

It's never a good time to invest a lot of money! DCA is the only way to go. Going "all in" over a short period of time will either curse you with euphoria or despair. Either one leads to poor decisions down the road. Those that "win" in Bitcoin are prepared to play to the long game (years). Best of luck.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:44:43
The software you can personally audit to a degree you feel comfortable with is the best. Otherwise, the core software is best for it being combed over by a community of developers all the time and that makes it very trustworthy.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:22:02
Thanks. This is nice. 
Regardless, Paper wallets have been the best tool to on board new users. But I whole heartily agree that they need a lot of disclaimers and only built by those who know what they are doing.

@_date: 2018-12-31 12:45:37
How auditable is that claim? Have you personally verified that there is 100% gold there? How can you be sure the custodians are not "double dipping" in other markets? Gold as money is history. Gold as "the" store of value is fading. Even if this ETF is honest, the broader gold market is not. It is controlled and manipulated to favor the dollar as the only place to go.
