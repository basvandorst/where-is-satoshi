What does this say?

Sounds like your router is blocking incoming connections. Perhaps a firewall on the router configured too strictly overruling forwarded ports.

Blockchain.info gives you the private keys. So according to the logic in your video it’s a wallet. But, who knows who else has access to this information. Since it’s a web-wallet it’s not a very secure wallet and Mycelium would indeed be a better option.

According to more recent posts it seems you don’t get any incoming connections through your router.
To explain my post further, if the result of the test is Stealth your router isn’t accepting any incoming connections at that port and probably not at any port (do the full scan).
If it does accept incoming connections and port 8333 isn’t forwarded correctly it will give Closed as a result.
If you are sure the router isn’t blocking incoming connections (what about a ping test?, also available on that site), and port 8333 is forwarded correctly the result should be Open and everything should be working fine.
If you are sure the router isn’t blocking anything then it could be your ISP blocking traffic. Using a VPN could circumvent such a situation.

After typing the seed words select BIP39 seed and in the derivation path put:


Your coins should show. If not, check all details and try again.
If the derivation path is different Electrum simply generates a different wallet.

They actually died. So now they’re just playing the track they recorded in season 1.

Fork bitcoin. ShoeCoin.

Yes, into a wallet. The specific process depends on what platform you are using. But in general, you must download wallet software (e.g. Electrum for PC, Mycelium for Android/iOS, Bread for iOS etc.). If you open this software it will guide you through setting up a wallet, which includes providing you with a seed, and a public address. Once set up,  send Bitcoin from your Coinbase account to one of the public addresses the new wallet software has provided you.
There are plenty of guides online, search for one that is recent. Be careful about malware, especially on Windows. Keep the seed secret, don't copy paste it or save it on a computer. If you have a lot of money, consider a hardware wallet. Test with small amounts first before sending large amounts.
If you ever remove the software or lose the device, you can recover your funds through recovering the wallet with the provided seed.

Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if Coinbase sold their BCH after the fork, just to wait for a reduction in price in order to buy back in low and pay out to their users. Stay away from these type of companies if you want to be money smart and maintain full control over your funds. There is no reason for not withdrawing your Bitcoin to a real wallet only you control.

SMS is quite easy to intercept. Security should be something you know, something you are, and something you have. Not something you receive, because someone else has it too (the sender, and anyone who intercepts), not only you. Big security flaw.

They are waiting to buy in cheap before sending it to their users. It’s just taking a little longer to drop to $1 than expected.
Move your coins away from Coinbase if you want to profit from the hard fork.

Before choosing a wallet, read about how it will handle the fork as well. Also, preferably your wallet is open source.

If this is indeed the case, and you don't mind sharing, other people might avoid an attack like this knowing which altcoin wallets to potentially avoid.
What is strange though, as is pointed out below (QR of seed can be found in Google Images), is why the attacker would put a wallet on your computer that has already been compromised (so more people than only the attacker had access to this particular wallet).
