@_date: 2017-12-22 17:36:25
im a noob. should i buy some btc and wait for it to go back up?

What happens once I want to spend the coins? There will be high fees for that so it doesn't really matter if it free from gdax

i know but i thought this was like a catastrophic thing happening right now. people making it seem like btc is failing or something

ok well i just got fully set up on GDAX. how do i switch my LTC funds on coinbase over to GDAX....and once i accomplish that im gunna want to send it to another private wallet. theres where the rediculous fees come in to play, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:37:22
so if the price per coin goes up the fees will go down?

hey i read somewhere a guy tried to send $40 in btc with only $80 in his wallet and didnt have enough to cover the fee....are the fees up is this true? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:45:44
oh wow coinbase isnt letting me
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:36:03

your not messing with me?
because this has me worried. Its from a diff thread on a diff sub:
**So......I went to do this today. I saw it would cost about $30.00 to transfer $500 in BTC ($470 after fees), so i decided to follow the advice on here and do it thru GDAX for less that .25%.**
**Sounded like a great idea and innovative way to save some $$$.**
**quick rant**
**$30 for a god dam transfer of $470 after the purchase fees? SO.....most people have to work over an hour to transfer $470 in BTC now, after paying the Coinbase purchase fee? This shit is getting ridiculous!**
**/rant over**
**So now I have been waiting 5+ hours for my funds to leave Coinbase/GDAX.**
**Over 5 fucking hours and i can see the transaction on Coinbase as "Pending."**
**5+ hours of pending. This is bullshit.**
**It's like some rich white crooked asshole politicians recently woke and conspired:**
**"Randolph, I know how we can make an ass load of money in a hurry by fucking over the fringe users of the internet. It's call Bitcoin, and no one will suspect a thing, and the kicker is, these idiots are addicted to a product they get with it, so they will have no choice but to get royally ass raped! And we profit!"**

why tho? so if i bought $50 in btc and wanted to send it to someone elses wallet how much would the fees be with the middle/medium option on mycelium? last time i sent any btc the fee was $5 and that was last month for somewhere around $60 in btc sent
