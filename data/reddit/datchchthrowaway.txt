Okay this is a dumb question from a bitcoin noob, so don't laugh me out of the building!
I use a service called mybitcoinsaver to regularly purchase a small amount of coin each week. This is tied to a Blockhain.info wallet.
Is this a secure wallet similar to what you've listed above? If I'm concerned about the hacking risk, how do I mitigate this?
I've also got a Xapo wallet setup, because I've got a Xapo card on the way. Would it be safer to move my BTC to Xapo?

I actually have a mycellium wallet on my phone with a bitcoin that I swept from cold storage (I had forgotten my account password for an old Blockchain wallet, but luckily had exported the paper wallet).
Is it quite a bit safer than Blockchain?

So provided I've got the 2 factor setup on Blockchain with a solid password AND I've got a physical backup stored somewhere secure - I should be pretty safe?
Sorry for all the questions

It seems crazy that it is so hard just to send a basic transaction.
I even tried transferring from 1 wallet of mine to another with a transaction where the fee was equal to the amount I was transferring. Still stuck!

I have done so now ... just trying to see if anyone here on the Reddit community has encountered a similar problem or has a good guide.
If there's a way I can send those coins using the private key (which I think is what I have on that paper wallet page printout) then I'm happy to do that as opposed to trying to recover the Blockchain wallet.

Thanks for the explanation. I guess I should add why is $55 being talked about when I only tried to send $5 + a $4 fee?

I contacted blockchain.info and their support person was pretty useless (I don't think their grasp of english was good enough to get what I was trying to say). He just kept saying "sorry if you've lost your password the funds are gone forever" and wouldn't acknowledge that I have a paper wallet backup OR the fact that the mnenomic - as provided to me - doesn't work.
Looks like I'm going to use mycelium + cold wallet feature just to send those coins to my main wallet. 
Thanks for your help everybody.

It's not that I can't figure the mnemonic out ... it's that the 2 of the words (exactly as were given to me by blockchain - I printed the page, rather than transcribing) aren't recognized.
Sounds like I will just have to sweep the paper wallet! 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:39:57
Yeah I've hade a similar issue - stuck on 0/3 cofirmations (albeit only for 14hrs so far)

This is the transaction ID:  - It's the amount for 1PXCSyww7wQvSWkTCeyGgbpm2ecsyjxCj1 that is confusing the heck out of me!

Glad I came across this thread - I've got a small amount of BTC that I'm trying to move from my wallet to Poloniex to buy some alts with.
Stuck for 12hrs so far at "pending" with 0 confirmations.
Really annoying! 
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:12:15
Agreed. This is all I have done over the past couple of years and will continue to do.
I have taken profits out to spend (after all, I do believe money is there to be spent) but basically just buy and hold, and do the same with ALTs as well.
I'm too busy to be actively trading, so I'd rather just think long term!
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:45:17
Okay cool - so effectively $55 has to leave my wallet but I only spend the amount I wanted to spend?
And is there anything I can do to speed up these two unconfirmed transactions ... It's super frustrating! 
Thanks for your help

Yes, I do get the drift of what you're saying. Makes sense.
Nonetheless, do you have any good recommendations on card providers that allow you to load up bitcoin and then spend in USD? 
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:59:01
That would almost be worth it for the lolz.

Cheers for the input.
Gift cards are sounding like a reasonable option. For example, when I go to Vegas I plan on doing a lot of shopping there. I've found gift cards on eGifter for 4 or 5 stores I want to shop at that are in one of the big malls near my hotel.
I can get the gift cards on my phone and then transact in store. Also, groupon vouchers seem to be available so I can hopefully by a few excursions as well.
I do wish there was an easier way to just say "turn this $1000 worth of bitcoin into a card with $1000 of USD" (with some kind of fee probably on top).

I'm not leaving until end of September. Should I be concerned that reviews seem to be bad for the xapo card from what I can find?
@_date: 2016-07-30 03:44:58
Hmm that's quite a cool idea. I'm spending about a week in each place so could order before I arrive.
How about using Bitcoin to purchase gift cards from  ? 
There are cards available for plenty of the shops I want to go to. However, I still would prefer to find a way to turn my coin into convenient cash.
