there is no methodology but maybe an educated guess. I am not claiming I can predict shit as TA is trying to say. I think 1000 is an OK price for a coin which can handle 3txs per second, is centrelized by mining groups and fees are in double digits. Well thinking about it now i guess 100 usd is appropriate.

My girl is fine with it I told her  I am holding, although I did not buy such a shitcoin like u did
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:33

Btc is the biggest shitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:34
Just because it was first shitcoin and got popular it does not make it a good coin. Do you even realise this shitcoin can do 3 txs per second? It is actually the worst coin out of top 500.

Technical analysis is a joke. But I am expecting BTC to drop to around 1000 dollars
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:12:30
ALl cryptos are dropping because of BTC and pairing with it. Look and unconfirmed transactions and look at fees. This has never happend before the network is completely unusable if you do not pay 50 dollars fee you can pray the transaction will get approved in normal time. 285k unconfirmed transactions.

Eth has decentralized security, more transactions, faster, cheaper, ETH is better at everything. 3 txs per second is certainly not enough we would not have nearly 300k unconfirmed transaction. You are so deluded it is sad. And that is just an example there are much better things than ETH

It will go to 100 dollars buy then.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:49:37
Well, Bitcoin is a shitcoin and it is completely unusable so in my opinion it should not even be in TOP 100. So if i judge a coin by its competition and usability that is wrong? But if you judge your shit buy some magical 10k psychological barrier that is right? I am not even triggered, I am sad.
