I've seen many times it being mentioned that bitcoin has a limited supply or only 21 million bitcoin can ever be created, and when you understand bitcoin you know why that is a big deal, unfortunately most people don't understand bitcoin, but when they see "Only 5M bitcoin left" they think
"Shit, better get some while they're still in stock!"

Eric and Tone made excellent points and the response was weak. Paul did not have much have input but AirBitz is a great wallet, I can understand his (conflicted) situation.
Ryan got slaughtered, I would have love to see this panel with Roger Ver included to see if his arguments could hold up, but for me right now coffee chain is dead.

Just because it's undesirable or confusing doesn't mean it won't happen. This is in the nature of how the Bitcoin blockchain works, you can't change how things work by just wanting it.

The miners will type it, the nodes just follow one of the 2 chains.

In the end it is all about incentives. There will be people transacting and mining on the old chain, how much value or hash power that chain will have is debatable but if they have the choice having all their transactions wiped out or not, guess what they will choose, it won't be hard to coordinate that.
