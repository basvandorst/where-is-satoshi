NewsBTC covers pretty much all the major news in a day, except the articles are really short.
CoinBuzz's writing is actually very good, and I've seen the writers disclose if they are involved in whatever they are writing about etc. which is always good to see. Currently my favorite site.
Bitcoin Magazine has a few interesting longform pieces, but for the most part, they're not very news-y.

Are you familiar with how TOR or BitTorrent work? Bitcoin operates on a similar premise. 
It's run by a decentralized peer-to-peer network of [computers]( You can take part in it if you want. There is no one company paying for servers or equipment.

Oh, I don't think you can use Coinbase with SEPA. It only works with American bank accounts.
I think your best bet is Bitstamp.

Very cool. The $100 pricetag of Trezor wallets is a barrier of entry for some people. This could easily be a competing product.

Do you personally believe it's possible that Ross Ulbricht's claims are true, and that Mark Karpeles and Ashley Barr were indeed running the site and using him as a scapegoat?
For those who haven't read up on it, [link to the story](

My bad :P

I think what he's saying is that you still need to get coins from somewhere to load the Trezor.
