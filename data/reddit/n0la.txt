Good job on saving. It's amazing how much a tip can make people with little to no bitcoins so excited. If I get a 1$ tip that makes my balance jump up close to 5%, haha. Considering some people have thousands of coins, it's a great idea to get people involved.. hell I think I signed up for blockchain.info just because I got a tip. Everyone that hasn't done it, don't forget to cash on on your karma! [Redeem your karma for bitcoins!](
