Central banks do intervene to reduce short term volatility. I don't know where you got the idea they don't. Examples are the swiss central bank a year or so ago when the CHF was appreciating too much and the Russian central bank recently raising rates to reduce ruble depreciation.

Volatility tends to be the exception in fiat currencies so central bank intervention tends to be the exception as well. I don't agree that you can have low volatility without a controlling hand. It's not possible. Commodity prices tend to be more volatile compared to currencies because their is no central authority that will ease out any spikes or dips in prices.

You still need someone to collect deposits in bulk and give out loans. Who is going to do that job? A financial intermediary aka bank. It can be an online bank or a bank with branches in meatspace but it's still going to be a bank.

Bitcoin supply is increasing by about 10% a year. One block every 10 minutes means 3600 new btc every day (the actual amount is higher than that because there is a lag between hash rate increases and difficulty adjustments). As time passes that increase in supply in percentage terms will go down because the total number of bitcoins will go up.
The increase over last year is because demand has outstripped the increase in btc supply. When that stops happening the price goes down which is what we've seen since jan.

It'll never be stable enough. Compare it to other commodities like say gold. Gold prices reached a peak of some $1900 a few years ago and then dropped from that high. Today they hover around the 1290 - 1300 mark which is still too volatile for a currency. 
OTOH fiat currencies tend to be stable because there's a central bank that intervenes to ease volatility. You can't have that with a decentralized currency like bitcoin.
Yeah go ahead and down vote like the wankers you are.

Most bitcoins are owned by a few hundred to a thousand people. The wealth has not been distributed fairly at all. Also you have a dozen or so people who control the entire system. For example the 4 core developers, the people at the foundation, the owners of major mining pools and the guy behind the only major forum. Some of these people are very nasty. For example Elizabeth Ploshay who lobbies for the apartheid government of Israel.
@_date: 2014-09-13 08:51:56
What would you call it then? Deflationary in the long term provided that demand outstrips the generation of new coins. But if that doesn't happen it starts to depreciate in value.
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:31:29
It's called just "address" not public address or public key. The public key is different. The address is a hash + checksum of the public key. The public key is only revealed the first time you spend bitcoins from an address. 
I'm sure coinbase has an option to generate additional addresses. Perhaps you can ask their support personnel or look it up in their documentation?

It's very dangerous in my mind. I know USB is a general interface and can accommodate all sorts of devices. But they need to be programmed for that. The fact that this device can also act as a keyboard is bloody dangerous. I'm not plugging that into my system!

But bitcoin is bad for the environment because mining wastes electricity. It also creates a large amount of toxic ewaste that gets dumped in third world countries where little children work in unsafe conditions in order to extract some value from all that junk. Does greenpeace no longer care about the environment and all the people that live in it?
edit: Oh I see it's greenpeace *USA*. They only care about the US environment not shitty 3rd world countries'.

It's unjust because the rest of the world will now have to bow before them. They'll finance wars and enslave the planet. It's already starting:

I'd like to add that exchange owners are also a part of this elite group of a dozen or so powerful people in the bitcoin world. People like Mark Karpeles for instance.

There is no guarantee that they do. But the real innovation is a distributed consensus system i.e. a public ledger that everyone accepts is accurate and complete. 


It's a public ledger so they aren't really anonymous. In fact the ledger, which is called Blockchain (not to be confused with the website blockchain.info), is a gold mine of data for companies and governments around the world.

It can be done because you only need to convince a majority. As we've seen in the past a strong leader operating in the right circumstances can convince the majority of people to back any course of action. Examples are hitler and dubya.

A metallic coin lasts for 13 years. A paper/cotton based note for 2. A plastic one even longer. Bitcoin needs miners to be active all the time for transactions to be processed.

Also it's not only bitpay but 3 bitcoin payment processors in total so I think pandarr is mistaken. No one is going to sign up with all 3 off them. That is paypal's job. They just have to sign up with paypal.

Bitcoin is way more inflationary than fiat at the moment. Around 10% per annum. That number will fall though and transaction fees will increase. Right now bitcoin holders are paying for other people's transactions.

They all do that. It's called redemption period.
I don't know why you are on about how things were in the 90s. Who cares? This is 2014 and things haven't been like that in ages. A domain is a domain is a domain doesn't matter where you register it as long as you have full control of it which is something that all registrars give you via their control panel.

Who will determine whether the borrower is credit worthy or not? Who will decide whether the collateral is enough or not? The party that specializes in collecting deposits from savers, paying interest on those, determining who is credit worthy enough to borrow, making sure they provide enough collateral, lending them money and collecting interest on that. Is all that not enough work to require a specialist organization?

FYI all that stuff about offline devices with wallets i.e. offline wallets, paper wallets or cold storage is not really something a newbie should have to worry about. It is for those with lots and lots of bitcoins. For most of us a desktop bitcoin client or mobile app with a decent password is fine.

So this is  just for merchants to accept bitcoin. They can already do that with bitpay and coinbase. Further merchant adoption is not positive news in the short to medium term. It only results in the bitcoin price going down. It would only have been good news if paypal allowed you to receive and spend bitcoins which is not what this is about.

That's because the transaction has already propagated throughout the network. You can't push it again.

Bitcoin won't work without internet access and infrastructure tends to suffer during war time. So buying bitcoins is not going to help. Stockpile food, medical supplies and other essentials instead. You could also seek asylum in safer places like north africa and asia.

The address is worth nothing. Do you have a paper backup of your wallet? You need the private keys. They are generated from the wallet root key. That is stored in the wallet file as well as on paper backups if you made any. If you have the paper backup you can use it with this site:
It will generate the private keys which you can import into another wallet and spend your bitcoins.

So why do you want browser based stuff when you can install an offline wallet instead? Is there some reason you are married to a web browser? If you must know the random number generators in browsers are a mixed bunch and there is no guarantee that they are going to be good enough. That is one reason why you should stick to application software for this sort of thing. 
Another reason is that you can easily do offline transaction signing with these desktop wallets. It's much harder to do that with browser based utilities simply because you have to construct the transaction manually. The two desktop wallets that support offline wallets are electrum and armory. Both will soon be bip32 compatible although I don't think they are going to adopt the bip39 dictionary.

I guess I missed that part. So this is even worse that I thought. Paypal likes to talk about accepting bitcoin but won't actually be touching bitcoins. It's keeping btc at a nice, safe distance.
