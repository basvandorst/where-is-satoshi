it means little by little the IRS will gain access to the blockchain and learn who buys what from whom and who pays taxes and who doesn't Blockchain is forever

Thereby placing an onerous burden on people who use bitcoin in their day to day lives as they have to keep records of each "sale" when they use bitcoin to buy something as they need to report the gain they made.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:28:30
That is a dual edged sword-your bitcoin cientt records every transaction but some people certainly have not reported their gains as there was no guidance on how to do so. Now they may not have the money to pay the tax (especially if their bitcoins have declined in value)

All excellent points.If the cc market ends up like the browser or search engine market you may be right IF bitcoin is one of the two or three
If cryptos proliferate bitcoin will be marganized
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:17:14
the catch 22 is that bitcoin is tied to the dollar as a benchmark price and companies that accept bitcoin really don't they "TAKE" bitcoin and immediately convert them to fiat.
Decouple bitcoin from fiat then its viable. As long as its tied it can be harassed by banks and governments

actually the question assumes a massive demand for non government issued currencies. Today very few even know enough about where money comes from to care to go out and get a bitcoin wallet. Don't see that changing, but if it did there will be plenty of currencies to meet the demand

True but it harms using bitcoin day to day as a currency. You don't "spend" forex profits directly day to day. Its not the taxation that is troubling its the manner in which you recognize gain- simply by spending bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:32:56
BINGO. This is a huge deal and you can scoff at it but it's real . The IRS will investigate this more than we can imagine.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:02:41
This is a huge deal designed to collect more taxes and make bitcoin inconvenient to use as you have to record every time you use it so you can calculate your gain or loss.
It is also a way for the IRS to start analyzing the blockchain to see you is buying what from whom and who is paying taxes and who isn't. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:39:48
the false sense of invincibility is dangerous
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:35:16
Because it adds a level of friction to using Bitcoin that the average person won't want to deal with. Hence it will harm adoption.
and for holders of bitcoin an unneeded inconvenience and prior tax liability
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:51:25
Good point, assuming the IRS is sympathetic to bitcoin. If not they won't be so lenient. Clearly this is going to scare off people from wanting to use bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:53:32
unless the IRS decides to "make an example" of bitcoiners in general. Remember bitcoin is a threat to the dollar. Egold and Liberty Dollar didn't get off easy
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:29:48
great point but how often does one trade their Star wars collectibles for groceries? The point of bitcoin is to use it as a currency, not to be keeping track of your cost basis and gain every time you spend it
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:55:55
Overstock is not really accepting Bitcoin-they are using coinbase to convert them into dollars for them.
Overstock right now is acting as a dumping ground for bitcoiners to cash out their winnings.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:00:25
until the IRS gets the records of merchants who accept bitcoin and finds out the names of the people who have used it and wants to know what their cost basis was in the bitcoin they used to buy merchandise. Didn't claim the gain? You think the IRS will just overlook it?
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:26:26
agree and its a lot more trouble than its worth to use them as currency as you have to report each transaction for purposes of determining your gain or loss
defeats the purpose of a frictionless currency

@_date: 2014-03-26 03:47:31
Therein lies the problem with today's ruling. The IRS can go back years and levy tax assessment on people. Why would people want to use bitcoin as a currency if they have to keep records for the IRS every time they buy something so they can keep track of their gains or losses.  Merchants may be required to turn over their records to the IRS so they can figure out who bought what and didn't pay tax. 
Eventually the IRs will be able to figure out a lot about what has happened on the blockchain.
Today's IRS ruling was a body blow for bitcoin as it made bitcoin less attractive to use.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:43:43
Most people HAVE used bitcoin to buy something where their address was recorded. You don't think the IRS can gain access to merchant records? From there they can begin to analyze the block chain to see who buys what from whom,  who pays taxes who doesn't .
Its all there in the block chain for the IRS to digest and start taxing on its finding.
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:53:41
but they didn't and they never threatened to do so, nor would any gold bug argue that greater "adoption" would mean higher gold prices

true there is a misperception but that has to be factored into the price. If bitcoin requires a thorough understanding then it won't appeal to the masses. Would like to see how the list of questions asked
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:36:10
You are far more aware than most on this topic. Most users of bitcoin were clueless and new users might not want to deal with bookkeeping just to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:25:11
that is one route -but one that many would probably not wish to go down as it would make them outlaws and tax dodges. That would hurt adoption

@_date: 2014-03-26 02:16:22
seems like all transactions have to be reported-kind of defeats the convenience factor of using bitcoin as a currency.
Don't report it- the merchant has a record and could turn it over to the IRS.
This IRS action was a body blow that will make bitcoin use impracticable and slow adoption- who wants to record all those transactions and pay tax on the too?
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:41:29
Wrong! It places an inordinate reporting burden on users of bitcoin such that they have to keep records of each time they use bitcoin so they can calculate their gain or loss to report to the IRS.
Many potential "adoptors" of Bitcoin won't want to bother with the reporting requirements
The IRS ruling is a body blow to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:50:02
Right hope coinbase and any other merchant isn't subpoenaed. From there its IRS investigation haven as they will gain transaction amounts, names addresses etc.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:22:39
You are correct. But have most people kept those records? Have people been declaring their gains? If the IRS gets aggressive they will learn far more than you could imagine. The convenience of using bitcoin would be gone if you have to record each pack of gum you buy so you can determine your tax bill. I suppose an app can be created to track you bitcoin purchases for tax purposes but that would kind of defeat the purpose of using bitcoin wouldn't it?

@_date: 2013-12-07 11:03:14
There is no floor and there is no upper limit. Until there are meaningful comparisons and market accepted metrics, valuation of bitcoin is all speculative
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:50:39
The idea is that the use of crypto currencies on a per coin basis should be lower.Bitcoin's $1000+ price is at risk because there are and will be  other crypto currencies that will do the same thing but have lower prices for their coins.
The problem with BC now is that there are lots of people buying it solely because it is going up and not for use as a currency. Alot of that money may shift to lower priced crpyto currencies as speculators try to catch the next wave. The trading in bitcoin has not had a stabilizing impact but rather the opposite
