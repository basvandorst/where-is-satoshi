Back in 2007 I had a TV show I had acquired by sailing the seven seas burnt onto a DVD. It was about three episodes in before she noticed there were no AD's playing. She asked why there were none, I explained how I had acquired such a dvd.
Fast forward a couple months and we're out shopping for a laptop for college in a very large retail outlet. I find my mom talking to the sales associate about how I'm so good with computers that I can download entire TV shows and put them on DVD's to watch. The retail lady's eyes grew very big.
My mom turned around "AH! pcharger! Here he is. He can put all these movies and shows on DVD! Darling, this lady here was talking about wanting some DVDs, she wrote her number down here. Do you think you could contact her later, she was saying she could pay you for them."
"thanks mom.....thanks"
never called the lady.

I made a google doc to explain Bitcoin to my mother because she was interested in investing in it. "Its reminding me a lot of the Gold Standard." Was her take away from the conversation we had. I typed up the google document which explain how to obtain bitcoin via Coinbase, how transactions work and how they're verified via the blockchain, how volatile the market is and to never expect to see $1-2k jumps every single day.
She still wants to invest in it, "I want something that in 4-5 years when I retire I can draw money out of and have that money to spend. I don't even have access to all the money I've put away in retirement plans! I have to wait for a pre-determined check amount every month when in reality I own all the money they just won't give it to me all at once."
I showed her this graph after letting her read the document: 
Her reaction was, "can you help me setup a coinbase account when you visit for christmas" :)
