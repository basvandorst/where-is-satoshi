Agree completely with your point about it being amplified by uniformed individuals. Seems a lot like politics where identity and tribalism are a major motivating force. I just started paying attention to bitcoin, so I don't really have a horse in this race, but it seems like both sides are dug in and unwilling to find a solution everyone can live with.

The key word there was 'may'. It absolutely could go to $600 again, or lower. There have been a lot of factors that have influenced bitcoin lately (scaling debate, japan acknowledgement, international political turmoil, etc) and I don't think anyone can say for sure how much each has influenced the price movement recently.
Best thing you can do is get schooled up on how it works, read about the recent developments in bitcoin and decide for yourself.

They're also still getting coins from mining blocks and will continue to get that reward until all of them are dead, unless life expectancy drastically increases.
To answer your original question though, I believe the thought was that by the time mining no longer provides a reward (beside tx fees), computing power and electrical costs will be low enough that it wont be a problem. Whether or not that holds true is yet to be seen, but it isn't a problem we'll have to deal with in the immediate future.

My understanding of what he said was that the difficulty would increase if more miners start looking for blocks. I don't have first hand knowledge of this, but it sounds like the difficulty is dynamic and adjusted approximately every 2 weeks based on the amount of miners, so more miners just means more difficult so that on average a block is found every 10 mins.
No idea on  I'm slowly learning this stuff myself.

There is another post about this issue. The consensus there seems to be that someone fucked up on a buy order and cause the price to temporarily skyrocket due to the limited size / availability of bitcoin on that particular exchange. At least that was my understanding.

Im probably not the best source, but as someone of the HODL mindset, the scaling debate doesn't really bother me all that much. I personally don't really care if I can buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin. I have no problem with bitcoin playing a role similiar to gold.
I think solving the scaling issue is important and will be good for bitcoin in the long run, but I also don't think the stalemate poses any risk of killing bitcoin. Even with higher fees and longer tx times, bitcoin is still useful.
