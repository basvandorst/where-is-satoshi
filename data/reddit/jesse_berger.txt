That’s exactly what I did. 
I tried listening to some other advice like waiting but what if sub 11k never comes? So pretty much as soon as it posted I went all in with btc

Perhaps you made the same mistake I made. 
I thought I was doing an ACH bank transfer on Kraken because I thought it was cheaper than say the fees on Coinbase. 
This was Black Friday. I waited all last week and it was still pending. Emailed support and they said it's a two part wire. You have to initiate the wire on Kraken and send it through your bank. Lost a lot of potential money in the process as I submitted the deposit at ~8000.
That is my only guess as why it could be pending, you failed to submit the transfer on your bank's end.

[This has been me for the past week]( 
After the craziness of the week prior.

Yesterday I invested $2000
Today I'm up $120 after fees! 
I love this.

$2000 is getting wired to gdax shorty. 
How should I spend it? All in? Or something like $1500, $250 and $240 in bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin.

Yup. I learned that the hard way. I wanted to invest that $2000 on Black Friday. I didn't on Coinbase because $30 fee was too high. 
It was $8200. That hurts. A lot. I didn't know that I could submit a deposit and be locked in at the price. I *attempted* to go with Kraken, yesterday I spent $30 plus gdax fees to wire it. 
Worth it.

Oh my god 
I bought in a week later than I liked but it still paid off huge

Excel. 
I'm tracking my earnings. I have the amount I purchased in a neat little spreadsheet, I have a simple formula of .xxxbtc * price = value 
Just playing with the formula I will make my first grand at my current investment at $16,050 per bitcoin.

I already had some coins in gdax and coinbase then after using them for a week while waiting for Kraken I  grew to like it due to the ability to invest small amounts easily. 
I strictly went with Kraken because I already had a verified account from a pass endeavor and because it had perceived cheaper fees.

I made my first purchase last week but I've been kind of dabbling in it for the past year when I bet the over during the Packers/Falcon NFC Championship game. Deposited $20, withdrew $30. Didn't have enough for a cash transfer so I accepted bitcoins.
Here where it gets interesting and kind of sad. $30.42 then like a dumbass I sent that little amount to Kraken for $5. Sold and sat on my coins twice. Couldn't withdraw so it would just sit in my cash wallet until I bought more.
Started with .03289 and withdrew just .01336 
Had fun and decided to get back in on it and I've already fucked up twice more.

Of course. I dont have to pay back my bitcoin loan until after I graduate.
Perhaps not the smartest strategy but even if this fails this experiment may only add a *few* dollars to my student loan monthly payment but if it shoots way up I could be debt free.

What is the best way to buy bitcoins? 
I feel sick. I deposited a small amount into Coinbase because the fee for $20 was unsubstantial. Then turned to Kraken on Friday for $2000 because it was $5 fee. 
I noticed there is already a pending order for .00243163 bitcoins on coinbase whereas on Kraken $2,000 cash is pending. 
So my $20 is now valued at $25 and my $2000 is still valued at $2,000. 
Had I paid the $30 fee would I have received say .24 bitcoins versus .2 when I finally buy it in Kraken?
I hate knowing that I lost $430 because I placed an order at the wrong site.

Bummer.. 
Just sold for I think 6200. My whole year with bitcoins was a whirl wind of emotions. Started with $20 from sports betting had about 0.03 bitcoins  Ended with .01 Sold and sat twice. So it hurts thinking that .03 could have been worth a lot more.. But $20 Boveda deposit to $79 is a nice return.
I hope to be back

This is making me sick. 
I placed an order to deposit $2,000 to Kraken yesterday.. At ~$8100
I just lost $150.

I seriously hate myself. 
January I decided to do some sports betting. Could only withdraw my winnings to bitcoins.. Cool whatever. 
Started with .03 sold them but was too lazy to withdraw it from Kraken and it sat dormant in my account for a month or two. So I took the small amount of money and bought .02 btc. Same shit happened. I sold. 
This time I got verified but couldn't withdraw, Kraken wanted proof of my SSN so I just ignored the email. Then yesterday I took the $65 that I had and bought .01 btc.
Had I not sold the first time I'd have $150+ off a $20 deposit on a sports gambling site.
