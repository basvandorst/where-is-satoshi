If you think investors understanding the technology they're investing in is an old person thing, especially in Bitcoin, you probably haven't been around very long

I couldn't have said it better myself


This is the main thing... There would be so much more value if everybody was in on the technology. Crypto isn't a commodity, but that's what everyone thinks it is now, because of their news trusting habits.

I stopped reading at "If you have a trusted third party, you don’t need any sort of blockchain". There's no such thing as a trusted third party in 2018. And the technology has nothing to do with the price, it could be $0.01 per Bitcoin and the technology would still be the same. Take your propaganda somewhere else please and thanks

Let me correct myself: It _can_ be ignored. Because the essence of crypto - to me - will always boil down to blockchain technology and the innovation and potential behind it. Every time I hear about old politicians and economists talking about cryptocurrency like it's only ever been a trendy commodity, I feel the frustrated pit in my stomach growing bigger.

Generation Z loves Bitcoin, because Generation Z loves technology and cherishes both money and independence
The only difference between Gen Y and Gen Z is that Gen Z understands Bitcoin, and millennials are just doing it for the trends and social media likes

You probably log into your WiFi network using WPA2, which is what's being affected by this vulnerability. Nobody has to log in to see your data, becuase the protocol used for your connection was cracked. You are not safe, and this is a big deal!


I have big reason to be more afraid than yesterday, because I'm careful about the things I do when I use a public network. I normally feel safe behind my home network. Not anymore!
