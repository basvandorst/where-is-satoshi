To me it seems that those are the people this "stall" is targeting. People suddenly flooded in wanting to make money quick and now they are slowly gaining or losing a bit. People will get scared, sell, and whales pick up the change

Just do a search. It gets unpinned randomly it seems and is a pain to find

This isn't true, see other answers

You shouldn't tell people how much you have

If it hit ATH, I think it would just fall back. That's a lot of movement for one day.

Accidentally bought in 10x what I wanted at the dip, let's go boys!

Can someone help me understand Bitcoin as currency? If I bought something with it today wouldn't I need to pay capital gains as well as any sales tax (US)?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:32:02
Just buy now

Not a problem but I'd still like to have those numbers showing. Makes ya feel better

USD/GBP is not a constant conversion either

Good call, I forgot they gave a date in the emails. Should have it tomorrow

Quite the green line we got there

Coinbase does not allow minors to trade in their terms of service. Putting money in will just put you at risk of them taking it away

What? It's just different currency conversions 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:34:33
They are all accurate. For whatever reason people are willing to spend more on some exchanges but that doesn't mean it's not accurate 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:39:47
Not that your point is wrong, but isn't ATH above 19k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:22
Only you can decide this. If you're happy selling at 20 then do it
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:58
Seems like it would be easy to launder with big ticket purchases then

20 this weekend?

How long does it take for coins to be credited to your coinbase account via bank transfer? I'm on 9 days and my payment has processed.
