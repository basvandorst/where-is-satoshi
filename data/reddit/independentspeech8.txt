@_date: 2018-08-25 11:54:06
may be it's because 


on localbitcoins? That was the real reason of BCH rise? But will it happen again if the BTC tx volume skyrocket? Or LN is weighing already?

@_date: 2018-11-21 13:53:25
stop stopping people from making predictions they can’t be sure about.
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:37:11
or worse trying to convince others to buy/hold based on some dumb analysis. People here have no shame. Mat be it grows, may be it falls, no one can say now

this could have been a hacked Revolut account. The owner woke up after a while, said I know nuffin about these transfers. 
Strange though Revolut is more like a paypal/credit card. You can't play these tricks with a bank I imagine. I was paid few times by dirty money and my bank didn't send it back even there was a criminal case

good point on May 20, 2017 the price was $1968 USD

just stop your hysteria already 
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:11:09
how the fuck is Revolut transfer is a "a reversible payment method" now? I thought it is at least as good as a bank transfer, am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:02:35

@_date: 2019-01-05 05:58:10

@_date: 2019-01-04 07:22:56
lead where? What is the point of keeping money in a volatile asset for them and other businesses?  Bitcoin is good for illegal trade - slave, drugs etc and tax evasion, nothing more 
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:28:24
does it look like this to you Mr supreme detective? May we ask how did you arrive at this brilliant conclusion? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:23:56

@_date: 2018-12-16 16:00:19
I want to tell you that life is more than winning in a roulette. What happened simply means you were destined to lose that money and had a bit of bad luck. Have faith in your destiny. You can get better life, women, fun, creativity without that pile of money you were hoping for. Have fun, find something you love in life and get rich that way
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:00:31

i think there is a number of international exchanges that you can trade on.  etc 
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:05:30
I got your point: You are not fucking
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:57:32
you don't know it. No one knows it. Stop spreading this rubbish 
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:04:48
Sorry may be I should have clarified - it is not safe selling in such an exchange. It is safe buying as long as the system protects you, there is some kind of escrow and experienced support, so some smartass doesn't pull a social engineering trick on you.
Myself I was buying on bitstamp. Then for some reason I couldn't deposit anymore, money would always come back after few days. Didn't dig deep enough. I switched to  figured if I buy, should be no issue, it's me who sends fiat. I usually buy via my own ad with a 1-2% discount and sell in another country with 1-2% premium. Selling is always a Russian roulette. But there is no exchange in Russia so I keep playing this. On localbitcoins you need to check the age of the account, trade volume and feedbacks. When i sell I Sometimes I ask for card photo and passport photo. Localbitcoins charges 1% may be there are cheaper platforms but are they safer... Localbitcoins support is good and experienced. If you go with localbitcoins enable "real name required" checkbox just on case

@_date: 2018-12-14 14:22:03
you should try to hodl and then suck your own carrot 
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:45:00
Unless it's cash. And even then you can be paid in counterfeited bills... That just shows that Bitcoin is much more liquid and reliable than any of other assets that humanity used until now. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:21:31
hodl my dick
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:53:18
Then everyone should buy a little more and thus we save the dying Bitcoin. He needs our help now. Please buy a little more and post here about it encouraging others also to buy and hodl. Also any other thoughts and theories why the price is totally unjust are welcome, come and post them
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:48:16
the problem with such p2p exchanges is that you will get paid from a hacked bank acc or dirty money and will spend next few months explaining to police what is Bitcoin. First hand experience TWICE
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:22:48
what is this image supposed to mean?
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:36:04

have you been living in a forest? I am pretty happy with Visa/Master, it enables gazillion of services around the world. I am fine paying them 1-2%. They also allow me to dispute payments, what else can I dream of? 
Bitcoin has its niche but hateful idiots talking nonsense here won't make it win over Visa/Master
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:12:42
