I was in Singapore in June 2014. I used 2 different BTC ATMs there. I used the Lamassu ATM in the CityLink Mall. [According to CoinAtmRadar it has been moved.]( This was a one way ATM (SGD -&gt; BTC). 
The other ATM was a CoinRepublic ATM. It is operated at [Bartini Kitchen (29 Boon Tat Street)]( Ask since he's the operator of it. This one was a two way ATM (SGD -&gt; BTC &amp; BTC -&gt; SGD).
Sadly, I think both of these may have closed within the last year.

I tried to sign up. Verification took about 5 hours to come back as failed for my Visa. All my information matched that saved with my credit card company. I then got an e-mail saying a Photo ID is needed. I've never had to submit an ID image to any non bitcoin website to use my Visa.
This seems just like AML/KYC laws at other exchanges. I was under the impression this only applied to using ACH and bank transfers, not credit cards. At this point, it's more of a hassle for higher fees than Coinbase. If Trucoin is trying to be an exchange too then it should support bank transfers. If Trucoin is trying to be like a normal online merchant that accepts CCs remove the extraneous identity restrictions. Perhaps allowing smaller transactions until a Photo ID is supplied would be a nice compromise.
tl;dr PhotoID requirements and long verification times don't make this better than any other exchange. **Unable to Buy Bitcoin with Visa or MC in seconds.**

Can you determine if the public key of an address is using the compressed or uncompressed form from only the address? What are the prefixes for the private key for the compressed version? Uncompressed version? How many bytes does this save from the size of a transaction, will it be enough to reduce fees?

Not sure about Brawker, but Purse.IO holds the BTC in escrow until the purchased Amazon item arrives at the buyer's house and they mark it as received. This releases the funds to the seller. Purse.IO would step in for a dispute, but with tracking  from Amazon this makes it unlikely to happen.

So glad I used [Teslin Paper]( for my long term storage. The creator of bitcoinpaperwallet.com recommend it. I ran a paper wallet under the kitchen faucet and not so much as a smudge happened with this paper.

Seriously? How does looking at the funds of a public address on the block chain make that address "less cold".

I tried the exact same thing. I bought DOGE, and tried to withdrawal them. It debited my account, but didn't list a TX id. Even though I started the withdrawal for the full amount, it only gave me a partial amount. I ended up making 2 more withdrawals to get all my DOGE out. The last 2 worked, but I'm still out about 40% of my coins.
I sent them an e-mail and I hope to get my DOGE. I just don't think I'm going to recover the losses from the glitch or exchange rate though :(

I stopped using CampBX after they dropped ACH transfers and haven't done anything in almost a year as far as improvements, announcements, or finding a new ACH provider. I've had issues trying to do arbitrage with them in the past because they exhaust their hot wallet on large and small amounts. It took a day or two in the past for them to moved cold storage funds. Hopefully it's just their persistent incompetence, and not maliciousness. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:58:17
So they manually resent my DOGE coin after I e-mailed them. They were surprisingly friendly despite what was going on. I ended up loosing nothing to the locking of funds. All my losses were to the disparity in the DOGE/BTC rate. I had a few mBTC still on my Vircurex account but all of them were returned after the redistribution of coins yesterday.

Since miners are incentivized to mine blocks as quickly as possible, and relaying all transactions in a block means a longer transmission time are some miners submitting empty blocks just so they propagate faster? Such as the one just now?

These are US KYC/AML laws. I was in [Singapore a few months ago where I used a Coin Republic ATM]( All I had to do was walk up, select Sell BTC, enter amount of SGD I wanted, it generated a QR Code, I scanned with my phone, sent the BTC, printed a receipt, waited for 1/1 confirmation, walk up, scan my receipt, it spits out my SGD. The process was about 25 minutes, 22 of which was waiting for a block confirmation.
There was no palm reading, no SMS verification, no ID scanning. The spread between BUY/SELL wasn't as high as Vegas's The "D". I believe the spread is set by the ATM owner.

(US Only) Since the price is dropping so much, couldn't I count sells/purchases with BTC as [capital losses]( according to the [IRS rules](
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:17:52
Question? Does the bitcoin transaction fee count as a fee that reduces the cost basis and sale price when calculating capital gains?
For instance if I buy 1 BTC @ $100 with $1 fee, then buy something for 0.5 BTC @ $1000 but have to pay a network Tx Fee of 0.001 BTC. So I send 0.501 BTC. Would that be like selling 0.501 BTC with a $1 fee giving me $500 and therefore a gain of $500 - $1 - $ 99 - $1 = $399 Gains?

I signed up, and there is room for a lot of improvement. But so far, it is a good start.
* Can't delete a payee
* Payments are marked as complete even if funds are not sent
* Should link to a blockchain explorer with a tx once a payment is sent
* Not all payees list a phone number (My utility company does not on my bill). So I couldn't add a payee without it.
* No autopay, would be nice to deposit bitcoin and have my bill paid automatically
* No preview of what the exchange rate is or what fees will be
* Account numbers should star all but the last 4 unless you're editing them
* Your reddit post says you're in BETA but if you log in it says you're in ALPHA
* Captcha on Firefox didn't work correctly. When the Capthca failed, it took me back to an empty form instead of keeping everything but the Captcha. I had to use Chrome to sign up.
* Should add a "Credit Card" category if you support people making their credit card payments
* Some of the textboxes's height weren't enough to show the style of text in them.
* Only post in the blog is from 2 years ago

The problem with Purso.IO is they require you to "Level Up" to be able to get any decent exchange rate. So you'll be paying about 30% more for your BTC vs. market rate until you've completed a few transactions.
Then add the current volatility in and of the very very few overly expensive orders you have the ability to accept... you can't. Because the price changed so much, the buyer who has their coins in escrow no longer has enough BTC to cover the cost of the item.
It's a Catch 22. Purse.IO would be a lot better if they didn't have the arbitrary level up system, they could handle volatility better, and auto remove or indicate offers that are invalid to price change.

In your screenshot see the green text that is boxed in? It says "ad". Never click those links. EVER. Not for any search, even if it's for under water basket weaving. Much less for Bitcoin. Ads are crap that constantly get purchased by fraudsters.
Additionally, bookmark your sensitive URLs such as Bitcoin, or banking websites in your browser so you don't have to search for them.
Sorry for your loss.

Noticed Wikimedia asking for donations, went to go give some bitcoin and noticed it was removed. Interestingly, in the edit history there was never a mention of bitcoin. Then when I looked at Google cache from just 2 days ago bitcoin was in fact there.

They don't have any direct "fees" but they give you a market rate in their favor at close to 1%. For instance, last payroll BTC was around $603.39 on Bitstamp but they sold me them at $616.92.

I wanted to get one, but I was unable to find any blog, post, or review of their service that wasn't directly tied to their site. There is just aren't enough reassurances for me to do so.
* The review by [Lyann Yuan]( seems to just be an employee or friend. 
* This blog post by some [traveling couple living on BTC]( was only minorly reassuring since they claim to use WageCan for miscellaneous purchases.
* The fact that the address in their ToS [1349 ½ Foothill Blvd. La Canada Flintridge, CA 91011-2168]( doesn't have any business signs or appearance of WageCan is another concern. Especially since that GoogleMaps photo is from Feb 2015.
* They don't have multi sig or 2FA which should be pretty common these days for BTC companies.
* They pay interest on balances yet charge no fees? Huge glaring red flag. They don't explain how they can afford to do this.
* The second step as listed on their site
 &gt; "Step 2 : Upload
Upload ID card / Passport scan and Utility Bill Scan."
 is concerning for me. I'm sure these are due to KYC/AML but I don't trust an entity that doesn't have much presence with my PII.
I wouldn't call it a scam outright. But until enough success stories come out as legit I'm going to wait. I've been burned too much in the past.

Is the Egyptian client familiar with BTC? Did they suggest it?
If you have enough money, you should offer to pay the company on the client's behalf MORE than they would receive by using PayPal but LESS than with Bitcoin. Then have your Egyptian client pay to your BTC address directly (which you then sell for Fiat if you like). You hand over the money when the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain (you could show them this too).
This way the company gets it's money immediately, client settles his accounts payable, you don't float much risk, you are seen as putting your money where your mouth is, you prove Bitcoin beats PayPal by action not words, and you make a few bits on the side on the difference between PayPal fees and BTC tx fees (also exchange rate differences).

[I know that feel bro]( I just got into bitcoin Monday and I fell for it :( Lost 0.5BTC after starting with ~2.2BTC ($250). I was going to do the "Launch" version with 0.1 BTC but I thought go big or go home. Thankfully I still only did the "Pro" and only lost .5 BTC
