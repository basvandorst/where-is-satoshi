Hey a degree in tech and you’ll make six figures.
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:34:17
You don’t need to be a genius to get a tech degree.

What about this one? 
@_date: 2019-03-10 23:01:13
Bitcoin is not an investment.
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:53:15
Or do you mind sharing resources on this so that I can read about it?
@_date: 2019-03-19 16:30:02
Still worth more than bitcoin which can’t be accessed without electricity.

How do you “spend” from a receive address? I’ve sent and received bitcoin from the one wallet which had a private and public address. I’ve never changed my address. If I change my receive address, what happens to the transaction history of the old address?

If that’s the case, do I need to move everything g out of my ledger hardware wallet and generate a new seed phrase?

I’ve been out of the loop. I have a hardware wallet and i haven’t touched it in a while. Do I also need to do something there? Is there any info on reusing addresses? I always thought I had one receive address but I see people talking about generating new ones or not reusing.

People saving for down payments, emergency savings, etc.
@_date: 2019-10-05 04:41:47
That seems very inconvenient.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:34:37
How can I set up a fund if the receive address can only be used once?
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:24:56
To protect your BTC. Lose one key or have it stolen and you’ll have your other wallets safe.

What’s rt?
@_date: 2019-12-26 23:52:36
Winning the lottery would do same.

What’s the relative debt over the decade?
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:10:25
Probably because they don’t know how to invest.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:34:32
Better than trading blindly.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:03:14
Then I think your question is whether trading is BS.
@_date: 2019-01-16 06:32:47
Too volatile to be used as currency.
@_date: 2019-01-16 06:30:08
Isn’t there like a 30 day period before you can buy back?
