Merchants will support it when banks implement it. Banks will implement it when customers request it. Customers will request it when merchants support it.

Does everyone's "drive" contain the exact same data? At a minimum I'd assume the data would be striped across all users. 
Of course this wouldn't prevent shenanigans, but it stops your proposed loophole.

I'm a bitcoin advocate, but yes I agree that we need to take these announcements with a grain of salt. I don't think these companies would ever come out and say "Well we were wrong. We wasted time and money incorporating some funny new tech and nobody's made a single payment with it. Don't we look silly. Sorry investors" even if it were the case (unlikely).

They use it just like they use cash. Keep a few bucks in your (casual) wallet and safely store the rest.

That last sentence is missing for me (1hr after you posted). Strange that they would edit that out.

I've bought at $50 and I've bought at $1000. Still buying. Same shit different day

Right? I love the people arguing about private keys when the freakin title mentions that they are BIP encrypted. Come on guys, do some research!

$50/wk is exactly what I did for a while. Best decision ever. Was able to set up automatic weekly buys in Coinbase, just like another user already suggested. All of my other investments are set up to automatically buy at regular intervals. So why not this? It takes the stress out of constantly checking the price and trying to time the market. 
I actually just shut it off last month, but only because I can't afford it at the moment (And of course the price has been falling ever since. That's life though :)

As others have mentioned, the biggest opportunity here might be to setup an exchange. A mining operation may become profitable, but perhaps not. And even if profitable, it would be a constant struggle to remain competitive. 
It seems like a better investment would be to create a bitcoin exchange. From what I understand, most people have failed to create exchanges here in the US due to miles of read tape. If folks on reservations are not subject to these same restrictions, then they are in an incredibly unique position to make this happen. I'll bet you would get even more donations as well since building an exchange would not only benefit the reservation, but bitcoin users across the US.

Same deal as with buying. They give you a price quote and stick to it no matter how the price fluctuates in the mean time.
Also, at least for me, the wait after selling has been much shorter than after buying (around 2 days vs 5). Just something to note.

Tell me about it. I spent over an hour calibrating my prints and wrestling with the printer in general, only to realize it didn't need to be that accurate at all. And I only needed 3
