I got this from their Twitter account. I suppose you can get this after signing up on the platform if they let you in. r/

The currency is [Toman]( apparently not Rial.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:07:53
True. I don't think its easy to buy Bitcoin in Iran and do arbitrage.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:03:52
Good work!
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:36:51
Yeah. I forgot about dimes. Its very similar then. Its interesting how they use Toman while the official currency is Rial

Good point!

I got it from their Twitter. You can probably signup and check it on their site.

Its a fish market!

Every time I hear about countries like Iran and Venezuela, I cant imagine how powerful Bitcoin could be for them.
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:17:34
Yeah I was thinking about that too. Obviously it has to be a centralized process. The exchange handles that with red cross.
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:11:34
These people get how powerful Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-03-27 03:30:37
For sure. Considering the situation its still a step. Not sure if this is fully done by red cross (which i assume not) or the exchange takes care of that. Either way I like the idea and hope it gets legitimized all around the world.

Short answer yes!

Its not about how much time it takes. The problem is that I dont want to install exe files on my computer!

Seems quite fun to use! Any plans for iOS users in future?

Is it kind of an nlock for number of blocks instead of time?

How can we trust these services? We have a lot of fraud cases even without thess technologies! Alibaba is definitely so ambitious but I am not that sure that they can ever make this by 2017 with their "dumb" servers.

I am pretty sure this NEM is going to be a game changer! Well-written article.

How can you eat this??!

I also agree that it doesn't really help the Iranian government due to the low market cap of Bitcoin and Bitcoin can not still be considered as an alternative for the Iranian government. However it can be a useful tool for some Iranians to purchase and sell their good to other countries.
