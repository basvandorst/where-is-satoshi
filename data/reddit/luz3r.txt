Normally I don't respond.
Someone I know says 'something something good intentions'. There is a good chance that guy was thinking what you were thinking what he was thinking when you saw him but what if.
What if he immigrated from another country and worked day and nights for years (years worth of his sons missed baseball games, years of missing his daughters ballet recital) for his upper middle class status only to marry a wife that cares more about her clothes then if he was having an ok day. 
What if he saw you and thought to himself 'I need to do more real work like that guy and I wonder if he cares if he gets grease on his hands....oh I just remembered that my car has a warranty, good thing since my tire has a leak.' 
Don't worry so much about what will happen to with your new wealth. Think 5 or 10 years out and see how much you need to survive (car insurance, cell phone bill, rent, etc.). It disappears quickly. 
It's also important to have fun so try to find the balance.

Why would they stop when it's already deployed in their merchant system? Doesn't cost someone time to disable it instead of leaving it enabled?

Will there be a mobile app or will you have to setup  a Internet facing site with the desktop application and use your phone to connect in?

I wonder if that also means that users will not complain about transaction fees?

Where the setting for the peers?

So I send the coins to Foodler and they order the food for me?
Pretty cool.

1 million dollars or 1 million dollars in Bitcoin?

How do you make a payment without the blockchain? Your still able to send the coins and the block(transaction?) is verified when the merchant sends it? I think I'm close just missing something. 
"To merchants, the main advantage is that the Payment Protocol makes the payment process much faster: instead of having to monitor the blockchain for new transactions, the transaction is sent directly to the merchant’s server"

I agree with this statement.

Thanks. Does it need to be Linux or can I run Windows 7?

I think it's nice to know that you (or someone else) purchased something with BTC. We're so stuck on everything else to remember that you can use it in real life.

I stopped for a quick coffee in Ft. Collins CO and saw that a coffee shop, Ally Cat,  takes BTC. 
What's is crazy is that the transaction showed up within a second of me taping send. I've been moving BTC around but never paid for something and I'm glad it was quick and painless. 
On to some coffee.

Thanks. Exactly what I was looking for.

Having a backup of both wallets is one way to mitigate this if you have a multisig wallet.

What's a  easy way to access your bitcoin core api on a Windows box outside the console? 
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:38:42
I know this is a broad question. What's the slowest Internet connection a bitcoin client needs for 1/tps? I'm in a low reception area and it took about 20 seconds to open mycelium and send some coins. 
What speed of bandwidth would a POS need at a store? 
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:32:25
Do you have a link to the bitcoin Wallet app? 
Do you go to settings and set your node as the only ip to connect to? 
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:03:40
Make sure to create a backup. Every 4-5 times I open Copay on Android I get a white screen and have to reinstall the app. 
I'm sure it my phone but always have a backup. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 04:30:32
Yes. The guy changed from Square to a Bitcoin app, typed in the amount and I scanned the QR code. 
He said that he gets two or three people a week who pay in BTC. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 21:03:55
I would destroy your backup if have any, makes it more interesting. 
Kudos for color printing.

How did you integrate the monitoring?

How can I verify that my node is helping? 
What is a possible attack on my node besides 0 day to the OS? 
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:57:29
Food! 
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:55:44
Do I have to update my full node?

Thanks for the replies. I'll look at the options in a few.
