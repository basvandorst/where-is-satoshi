I tried transferring around $15 USD with bitcoin and the fee was $4. Does this mean if I transferred $150 USD with bitcoin the fee would be $40? Or does the fee % change as the transaction dollar amount goes up?  Very much appreciated!!

I think I used the cheapest fee on Electrum, could it have been something else I did wrong?

Yeah that's what I use it for.  The widget is nice too on Android.

Any online backups? iCloud? Google Photos? Try plugging your phone into a computer if the port isn't fucked, maybe you can still view the files

Plot twist: linktype Photoshopped his address onto the paper so people think they're donating to the man in the photo

If it makes you feel better I only have $80 of BTC right now.  Being a broke teenager sucks haha.  I'd buy several BTC if I could.

I think it'll hit it within an hour, but drop a few minutes later.  5000 within the week.

Do you have any pictures on your phone that might have the paper in it? Even just sitting in the background. Maybe you could read some of them

I had a dream where the price of Bitcoin dropped to 300 bucks.  Woke up in a cold sweat and panicked to check the subreddit.  This is much better.

I wish I could buy bitcoin as a 17 year old in the US.  I used coinbase to buy some earlier this year but now they require ID.  Glad I at least have $500 invested in BTC now though.

I'm a minor in the US and I'm trying to buy some asap, I used to buy from coinbase and I have about $500 in BTC right now but they now require an ID.  What's my best choice?

I may only have about 230... I mean 240 USD in Bitcoin, but this is incredibly exciting.

Coinbase is starting to look shady to me.  I only had about $50 in it, but I'm glad I managed to get it out a few days ago.

I have 26 cents worth of Bitcoin right now.  I had 24 or 25 yesterday so at this rate, I should be getting a car any time now.

I bought 10 bucks of BTC at like 2600 from coinbase.
