More than 2 weeks ago my money has left my bank account to the bank account of cex.io to provide me a service. Right now i have no idea where my money is and the people who has to explain me don't tell me anything. I don't believe in that statement in this situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:39:05
It seems like they are very professional. But when you dig into it, there are people with problems like mine, complaining  they can’t contact to anyone about their problem. I’m guessing they are professional until someone has a problem!
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:51
Yeah same here. I’m investigating what we can legally. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:25
Yes it’s good idea. We should gather everyone and see what we can do legally.

@_date: 2017-12-12 09:36:56
I have indeed. The bank said they have sent the money and they can’t do anything about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:22:52
There are so many people even here saying how legitimate they are. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:23:44
Dude this is not supposed to be coming from you. They should be saying this stuff. They have written on their website it could take up to 14 days. Mine is longer than that. What did they explain me? Nothing. Not just me. Some guy waiting for an answer for 25 days now. 
I don’t wanna sound like bigger picture guys but this is something more than just lack of staff situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:19:14
they have finally put the money on my account today on the 31th. I have opened 15 tickets and sent lots of mails. They are horrible at customer support. cex.io never again
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:51:11
Thanks, i will contact there too. When i contacted from facebook, the person just told me to be patient. Thats not what you wanna hear when it has been more than 2 weeks right.

I don’t know what I will do, I might go to their office in london after Christmas and if nothing happens I will go to some Freud bureau

My money is lost since 28th of November. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:24:15
well, it can not get lost between two banks right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:20:01
No man, I'm just trying to get my money back. Important for me. I was just trying to make some investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:20:18
I understand what you saying. In their website, they have said that bank transfers can go up to 14 days. First of all that 14 days has past long ago. Secondly, there has been no answer. And last, I'm not the only person. There have been other people. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:25:08
Well, I have opened this post to warn other people to not do same mistakes. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:18:28
Its not big amount of money at all. In fact, other people i have contacted have not put big amount either. Im suspecting something is actually going on. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:32:30
I have sent same amount to other websites. And even more. They are already in my account. And these guys don't say anything, don't give any information.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:22:15
Come on man, I'm pretty sad about this :'( 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:49
Mine has been almost 25 days. Still no money appeared on account and no answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:10:56
I moved to Binance, everything smooth af there. No problem or anything. I’m just trying to get my money back from Cex. This process is  just mentally tiring.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:12:09
Same transactions with higher amount, different companies. It happened, I’m just trying to get my money back now, 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:16:32
UPTADE: AFTER 30 DAYS, IN THE 31TH, AFTER TENS OF MAILS AND SUPPORT TICKETS, THEY HAVE FINALLY PUT THE MONEY ON MY ACCOUNT.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:30:05
thats right. They don't give any detail about the problem at all. Nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:07:04
This defence is not supposed to come from you, who is another customer. They have to give that answer, because I’m their customer not yours. I’m not going to just sit around and wait when there is no answer. In your theory, I can wait 6 months without any answer, because they have a lot in their plates. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:06
Art you serious? I’m flying to London few days later. I have sent I don’t know how many mails but none of them have been answered. I think they have stolen our money for good. Are you from London? Do you have any relative or friend who is lawyer? We should find out what we can do legally.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:17:04
It was less than 2000 dollars. No big player at all
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:40:14
Hello, 
Thank you for your kind answer. My user id is: up111168448 and i have bunch of ticket numbers but oldest one is: 417932
I hope we can solve this matter. 
Best Regards
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:33:40
I can assume that you are right. But they re not saying anything about it, it doesnt leave me any option but to think about the worst. I have sent so many mails but nothing come up except the automatic mails saying we got your request. Thats it.
