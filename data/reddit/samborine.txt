It’s like calling a meal replacement ‘soylent’, no ones going to forget that.

I thought gold was valuable because of how useful it was for engineering purposes. Malleable, corrosion resistant and conductive.

Binance? Gdax? Depends where you are from really

You could have all the Geoff’s in on it though. I know two that might be interested.

You get two options, regular and economy. Economy was 10% of regular. I don’t know if the difference between amounts ( the 10%) changes with amounts sent or with current network fees though

Otherwise known as ‘the poor tax’. I actually didn’t connect the two. 
This part makes me kinda sad. Not that people are buying in, but because they have so little to lose.

Because you probably won’t get the ‘and then some’ or even all of your money back. Fees aside, how much is your time worth? 
From an entertainment stand point I get it though. My mum hassled my dad for spending money on books, he said ‘you’re happy spending $25 to go to the movies for an hour, but you think me spending $25 to be entertained for the next week is stupid?’ 
What else do you spend $25 on that your dad thinks is dumb?

Plunging is when something goes down

It’s a Warren Buffett quote. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:13:27
People go to Jail in the States because they can’t afford to pay parking fines. Its Dickensian. 
I have a few friends that are upper middle class. This isn’t on their radar, they all own businesses in construction or engineering ect. 
Same goes for the larger proportion ( but still small number) of friends I have that have good jobs and have managed to buy houses.
Most of my mates don’t have much, they work in hospitality or retail if at all. They are the ones that are excited and all they are talking about is how much money they could have made.

I read about that just before all this recent hype kicked off. They were living in a tent, which isn’t as horrible as it sounds. From what I read their current lifestyle of frugality equaled what a lot of my hippie friends do by choice. Simplicity has its merits. 
I remember thinking ‘wow they must be sure, it must be nice to believe in something that much’, which is pretty much the same thing I think about christians.

Makes sense. The same people wouldn’t have the option to invest or by assets. Thanks for answering my bullshit question.

I’ve never understood that before. Thanks :)

Maybe leave it alone and try a trading simulator for the next 12 months

I’m so sick of this quote

Selling his kids bikes for sandwiches. Probably making a mint in interviews.
