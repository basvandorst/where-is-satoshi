Keep in mind : i you pay crypto to a crypto-to-fiat payment processor, you dump ur coins on the FIAT market.
Having the ability to pay in BTC is not necessary as good as we think (i speak for the market, not for adoption), you buy something with BTC, they sell it to get dirty FIAT.

Let's make 10 USDT like stablecoins , 200 Shitcoin exchange, 30000% fake volume, and pump again.
And this is what is gonna happen, because fiscal paradise (wich are at FIRST juridic paradise) exist and its a FIAT-exit  
/or on-ramp for a lot of black monney real dollars.
The real question is : **Who is gonna sell ?**
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:29:19
As long as you have bought bitcoin and you :
\- accept the idea of not going back to FIAT
\- dont want to pay taxes anymore on ur wealth
\- dont want to pay debt thru inflation
just use wasabi wallet, mix ur coins, tell dem u have less and less every year (mixing coins predenting is spendings)
you can opt-out **NOW**
And remember guys, as  said :
**In a matter of time, you will have to choose between : the bankers who brought you the great depression or the geek who brought you the internet.**
And just in case, you can be almose 100% in Bitcoin, so how are they gonna make you pay sanctions if you have no fiat ? This is where we going

Now imagine when they realise Bitcoin is nothing but just monney, and 1 BTC will always be 1BTC.
Bullrun after bullrun people stack BTCs.
More and more get out of the sell side, and its getting tinyer and tinyer years after years (will) until you can't buy 1000 BTC at once, after will come the time you can't buy 100 and we will be in a new age by this time.

If you have to go to a judge for spending monney, i think you have to rewiew the defense.
If you leave in a totalitarian country where there in no KYC on-ramp, it's actually a strenght for bitcoin anonymity.
If you buy with cash, P2P in real life, you anonymize bitcoins.
U "just" have to find a local dealer, wich is the hardest and most unsecure part, but when it's starting to spread,it will be easyer and easyer to find bitcoin dealers for people who can't KYC for different reasons.

Basic maths with :
10'000$/BTC 
21'000'000 COINS
7'000'000'000 PEOPLE.
Market cap : 210 000 000 000 / 7 000 000 000 = **30USD** is the price to own a **share of bitcoin** wich represent the equavalent scarcity as YOU in the real life, **1/7'000'000'000...**
**Land :**  148'900'000km² / 21'000'000 : If bitcoin represent a share of the emerged lands, it would represent : 7.1 km² with is a fucking lot of land.

Bad idea for at least two reason :
1) You aren't sure who is the supplier, even if they "seems" legit
2) You aren't sure wich software will be in the miner, it CAN be corrupted by a reseller.
Only buy directly from producter (Trezor, Bitmain etc...) to avoid problems.

Bitcoin is monney.
FIAT you use to buy things and mesurate other things (bitcoin price per unit in FIAT for example) is DEBT.
DEBT in the end of the cycle is given without inteest, we are at the end of a DEBT cycle.
Something will happen, certainly inflation, inflation in assets and not in goods, like we're experiencing since 2008, driven with QE, wich is DEBT.
We have a debt driven global economy and Bitcoin is MONEY.
 Was gold most speculative assets in existence, before bitcoin ?

Yes, yes, yes and maybe yes.
The only people who will tell you no is people who can't pay debt, the richest people on this planet are debt maximalist as they are searching for an asset or business plan that **make more monney than the interest they have to pay.**
Bitcoin have been one of theses for the last decade.
So, not all in, just what you can afford, and if you think its a fair price, go in.
Otherwise, setup and use BitPay. (Dollar cost averaging)
Lend the maximum possible, lowest rate, 100% sure that you can pay.
And by the way, you are not in debt to buy a car that will lost 40% of his value in 1 year, **you still have the money, but have converted it into MAGIC INTERNET MONEY.**

Satoshi, 2010 : 
 In the absence of a market to establish the price (of bitcoin, estimates) based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service (thanks). **The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more.** At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price. In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around.

 A genesis block is the first block of a block chain. Modern versions of Bitcoin number it as block 0, though very early versions counted it as block 1. The genesis block is almost always hardcoded into the software of the applications that utilize its block chain. It is a special case in that it does not reference a previous block, and for Bitcoin and almost all of its derivatives, it produces an unspendable subsidy.

USD is not rare at all int created online by a simple click. Its backed by nothing except War and Corruption.
This make it a fraud.
I dont have to understand any of thoses fraudulent shitty's **monetary therory's** created by guru who print monney out of thin air.
Monney is a medium of exchange. Not an instrument, sorry to educate you about it.
State monney is fraudulent and it's not even real monney.
Bitcoin is not fraudulent, and it's monney.
And sorry to tell you its the end stage of government monney, just take a look at interest rates.
Sorry about ur crappy theory's but i **have one monetary policy** : 21'000'000 coins. Immutable, censorship-resistant , borderless, decentralized, open.
