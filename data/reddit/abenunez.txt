So you’ll have extreme immutability with 5 nodes? I really don’t get the hype on private fancy databases.

Is this a problem? reusing the same address to receive payments?
@_date: 2018-05-13 09:47:49
Ha! Didn’t know that.

Don’t let blockchain greed blind you to the potential of bitcoin technology.

That’s what I mean... we need to do a better a job explaining and arguing this whenever the “blockchain” topic is mentioned. As you point out, reward/incentives are never mentioned in the so calles “private blockchains”. Last week I went to a small conference where many companies talked about how blockchain will change everything. Including Microsoft, IBM and others but NONE mentioned even slightly what you’re pointing out which to me, is the core of this technology.

Excelente estimados!!!!

Could you share the guide used?
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:10:14
So how could you get fiat from your btc?
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:10:23
agreed. crypto acceptance of non-crypto people will decline if this goes through.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:48:55
same here, plz explain asap.

Ignorant here.... So there's a big crash again and everything goes down south...  BTC/USD price would fall too and most people will take their BTC off the net... how is BTC the solution in this case?

I use buda.com (I’m from chile)
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:31:21
Are you kidding me? This is real shit happining, not something that may happen sometime. Banks are closing all relationships with Chilean exchanges, leaving us without alternatives at all. I posted this because I havent read something like this happening  anywhere else.

he'll do wonders when he's 16
@_date: 2018-07-14 23:40:48
This is great!!
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:20:54
Hi, yup they did... however two exchanges won a case and they will re-open up the accounts. This is not a definite decision though, but with the new government is very likely things will get solved in the upcoming months.

Noob here.. A simple user guide to recommend? Does any iOS wallet be ok to get payments for services(hair cuts or something like that)? If I run a grocery store for instance, how difficult or what steps should I take/recommend to add btc as a payment option? In the other hand, if I’m selling goods online, do you just post ONE btc  address where all payments are made to? How do you link payments to customer orders?

I’ll be travelling to US and since banks have banned exchange accounts here in Chile if possible I’d like to withdraw some USD in my visit. How does the atm really work? Do you need any ID? Would a passport work?
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:55:43
Good to know they’re back ! 
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:53:53
Thank you!!! I don’t expect many buyers paying with btc but I think this could promote the word around and do a little marketing on the business as well. One other question though, if I locally set up a node and post a QR linked to the wallet node, would the node validate immediately the transaction?  
Have some homework to do!
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:41:15
Thanks for taking the extra insult out from your original post. Fud and reality is quite different. In Chile, crypto reality is very different than many other places and that decision crushed all possible outcomes and innovations around here. Again, thats not fud, is a reality shock. 
We’re glad for now things have calmed down, but it is just temporary as the court decision was just time buying for now.

What a terrible song...
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:04:29
Thank you sir!! I'll try this, I have and want to spend time on this... If it goes well, I'll make sure this is shared.
