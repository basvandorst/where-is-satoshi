Many. Including some to undermine trust in basic scientific theory.
Most people do not have the time or inclination to read research papers and understand that almost every study produces complex results. Most research does not lead to simple answers. Despite that, the average person wants everything boiled down into an easily remembered sound bite so they can echo it whenever their own beliefs are challenged.
Mr. 47763cd8-4e43-4a75-8 is a perfect example, he claims:


This is factually incorrect, our bodies literally turn most of the food we eat into sugars to power our cells. However, not all sugars produce the same results and each has it's own benefits and drawbacks. But it is not easy to explain each one, nor would it help defend someone's anti-sugar beliefs.
What is so funny to me is that Mr. 47763cd8-4e43-4a75-8 is doing exactly what he vilifies those "educated" people in the past for doing--trusting someone else's research and summary without a real understanding of the actual research.

You do realize that was an active misinformation campaign by the sugar-industry, right?


You mean profit-seeking big corporations and lobbyists. Just more proof that scientific research should be done by multiple separate teams and properly peer-reviewed.

LOL. Ok, make a giant strawman argument and then jump ship. 
 
Pretty easy to "win" an argument against your imaginary opponent that said those things...

Doesn't change my point either. Peer-reviewed, duplicated, and openly available scientific research is the best method to fight against those who would abuse your trust for their own profit.
