False. No central bank/authority is behind gold, yet it has true value.


This applies to literally everything.


Frictionless is not "purported" - It's a fact. And false, Bitcoin is not anonymous.

Three things to keep in mind about paper wallets
1. The randomness in which the address was created must be true.
2. The security of the system that was used to create it must be sound.
3. The spend history of the paper wallet. If you've never spent any of the funds on the paper wallet, you're very safe. Every spend you make (with change going back to itself) decreases the security. drastically so, if the signatures are not made with enough entropy.

It's true. Bitcoin has value from consensus - not a promise to pay or resolve debt.
Bitcoin is an asset, not a debt instrument, so it doesn't need backing. A worthless piece of paper with numbers printed on it, and a promise it can be redeemed for a weight in gold/silver or value of bitcoin, is a debt and requires backing and faith in the issuer for it to have that value.

Bitcoin's entire security is based on obscurity. If you can simply guess a bitcoin private key, you can spend funds there. Everyone's bitcoins are literally right there for anyone to take if they find them. Fortunately, there is a gigantic keyspace for private keys making it improbable that funds can be stolen (by guessing), but it doesn't change the fact that bitcoin's entire security IS obscurity.

Same CG rules apply to businesses.

If there is that much demand for a scarce bitcoin, they will be worth millions of dollars each. This will **"sure as shit"** increase the competition for mining them. The increase in competiotion will increase the computation, which will increase the rate at which blocks are solved, which whill increase the difficulty (to throttle down that rate). Bottom line: yes, bitcoin will use a lot more energy, but only about as much as the whole network is worth.

You could help verify keys and identities? In PGP, there is a web of  trust where people sign each other's keys to boost the trust people have in knowing a key belongs to a particular person. A Web Of Trust does not yet exist for bitcoin, but PGP is alive and well. Perhaps you could learn to sign digital documents with PGP so that the documents and signatures could be registerdd with a proof of existence system?
I would like to add a family trust to a proof of existence system, but there really isn't a good way to prove I authorized that document. If a notary was to create a digital signature of my digitally signed document, and those files were registered in proof of existence, then it could mean something - and I'd gladly pay for that.

The bottom line is a bitcoin private key is comparable to a hole you dig in the ground to hide your gold. Except, for every atom in the universe, there is a possible hole to hide it in. If someone sees you stuffing your bitcoins into a particular hole, they can come back and take it when you arent looking and instantly put it in their own hole, ~~thousands~~ millions of light years away.
Dont keep all your bitcoins in one hole. Dig your holes to hide your serious stashes of bitcoin in supreme secracy(offline).

Depending on your wallets view of the nodes on the network, bitcoin tranactions are instant (a few secods). Double spends are the big issue and cannot normally propagate through the network once nodes see an output being spent. Another issue is a double spend that includes a larger significantly larger fee to convince miners to exclude one payment for the double spend.
These double spends have costs and risk of failure just like counterfeiting fiat. Therefore, it is reasonable to accept some risk of payment failure relative to the chance of someone taking the risk of trying to make it happen. The same way its not profitable to counterfeit $5 bills, the risk of losing a $5 payment is really low because of the expense associated with controlling enough nodes to relay the double spend. If you are doing larger purchases, then there are usually other saftey nets you can rely on to make sure your payment goes through, like knowing your customer and the legal system, or simply waiting up to 6 confirmations.
Letting someone pay with a credit card, you really have several months of waiting to know if you really get those funds because they can be clawed back by the processor. With bitcoin, you really only have to wait 6 confirmations in the worst case.

The math problems are arbitrary - but easily modifiable (made easier or more difficult) so that the rate of new blocks can be throttled to a 10 minute period of time - no matter how much computing power is added or removed from the network.
The overall work itself provides non-repudiation for events in the past. Just like in the real world, when you do useful work, you get paid for it - bitcoin miners are rewarded with a financial incentive for processing transactions and securing them in the accounting ledger of bitcoin.
This "financial incentive" aka a digital currency, explicitly tied to the blockchain itself, can then be used by those miners to exchange for goods and services.

Risky investments usually have the best returns, but a good chance to lose it all. If you pick right, you win big. If you lose, it could be all gone. That should be the expectation with risk anyway.
Since you are young and have plenty of time to make up that $1000 if it disappears. And there is a reasonable chance bitcoin can rise in magnitudes of value in the next decade - way way way better than any traditional investment. 
Study why the blockchain works. Investigate alternatives. Listen to everyone's opinion and build your own confidence and sense of direction where this technology is headed. Stuff like this only comes around every few decades so make the most of it.

First of all, if you're a merchant who can't deal with transaction malleability yet, then you have a whole set of other problems to deal with.
Second, merchants have the same recourse for failed payments. They can escalate from 
1. "hey, your payment didn't make it, shipping is suspended until it is received", or 
2. "we shipped your product, but due to the recent issue with the blockchain, your payment was rolled back. Please resubmit your payment with these details", or
3. Due to lack of payment, we are submitting your bill and contact info for collection.

Satoshi has a lot of coins and movement would spook the market. Satoshi will "spend from the top" until he gets to those really old coins, at which point the market won't care as much because "it will be too late". In other words, he will spend the coins he mined later on before he mines the ones he mined in 2009 as it will be harder for the rest of us to identify him as the spender. It will spook the market less. By the time he gets to those old coins, the bitcoin network will be much more widespread and in use by the global population.

The reason bitcoin works in relation to the way I rephrased your question is this:
Bitcoins are spend to a hash of a public key (a bitcoin address). To spend those bitcoins at the new address, the spender must sign (with his private keys) a new transaction to another bitcoin address and publish his public key. Everyone else can then use his public key to verify his signature (made by the private key) and then hash the public key into the same bitcoin address (verifying the private key is the right one for that address).
So bitcoin keys don't have to ever be "online" at any time for a spend to work.

And its not just those "legitimate" companies you'd have to worry about. Coins need to be "online" (at minimum decrypted in RAM) in order to sign blocks. This means they can be stolen by someone with a "watch the world burn" mentality and used to effortlessly destroy the economy.

Bitpay does not payout dollar for dollar. Their settlement policy has a minimum $20-25 when settling to USD. If he receives $19 for one sale today, he wont get any cash at his bank until the next sale happens that pushes the balance over that limit. But the cash is there in his account. It just might take awhile to get it.

@_date: 2015-03-09 16:30:48
It's not that complicated. Start off with:
People "users" spend bitcoins or don't over a period of time (avg 10 minutes).
People "miners" running mining hardware/software are doing work to prove the authenticity of the bitcoins being spend and the authority of those users to spend them.
For this work, miners get to collect fees and monetary inflation for doing a good job. The miners then get to spend their profits in new transactions in the near future.
That's pretty much all the average joe needs to hear to start. If they are more curious, you can help them down any rabbit hole their mind needs to go to reinforce their new understanding.

Nope. The more you use a private key, even with a good RNG, the security degrades (albiet infantessimaly). Also, the first spend publishes the public key, which makes it theoretically vulnerable to QC attacks.

the victim doesnt realize the theft for days. additionally, it will take days at least for some governing body to investigate and declare the coins blacklisted.
 in that time, ive donated some stolen coins to the charity and they used the funds to do some community service.
consider that stolen coins cannot be distinguished from good coins after the inputs of both are combined into an output.
how are you going to affect a blacklist on those funds? answer: you cant.

A merchant's honesty is not the problem. It's the consumer's and theives.




Yes, because it reduces merchant's costs. PCI compliance is meant to protect consumer credit card information and restrict identity theft. PCI compliance has no context in the bitcoin world as transactions change from pull to push.


Bitpay receives zero confirmation payments on behalf of merchants all day long for years and has not yet ever been the victim of a double spend.


I don't have to pay inflation subsidy, therefore, its not a cost to me. I get paid in bitcoin, there are no conversion fees. I accept the volatility risk. Sometimes it's up and I get a discount. Othertimes it's down and I simply use dollars instead. The power requirements to maintain the visa/mc/paypal datacenters has a carbon footprint as well. Not even mentioning all the carbon that goes into all the periphery like merchant POS, readers, etc.


Absolutely true. Credit card records can leak hipaa data. Bitcoin is a cash-like transaction with much more anonymity than CCs.

Sorry, it is true. There's actually a [website]( that lets you browse through all possible private key and check its balance. Its a joke, but the site works. Problem is, there's too many possible keys. Additionally, there are people who put together word lists, phrase lists, and every kind of list you can think of, with permitations used to calculate private keys and sweep any funds.
The only thing you can do to stop this kind of theft is to use best practices in your key management and use.

Your funds are spendable in ALL forks. The worth of those funds are what is in question.

It is highly likely that one fork would eventually die from lack of support.
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:22:52
Thats why if the value in the network falls, the computing power falls. If the value goes up, the computing in incentivised to go up. And the difficulty of each block remains overtime, so that if the value decreases, the computational power required to overwrite older transactions (when the value was higher) remains in tact. Its a beautiful system!

Once inputs of satoshis is combined in a transaction, they are indistinguishable. You can no longer blacklist them without blacklisting the entire output. Additionally, bitcoins can be combined like this billions of times before a blacklist declaration can be made. Effectively, blacklists cannot work. Therefore, bitcoins are entirely fungible.

Monetary inflation adjustment by the protocol. Every 210,000 blocks that get produced, the inflation gets cut in half. It started out at 50 bitcoins every block. At block 210,000, it was reduced to 25. At block 420,000 ([somewhere in 2016]( it will be reduced again to 12.5.

It's pretty difficult to conceptualize.
1. Individuals and businesses would continue to hold currency on each of the networks. But EVERYONE would have to make the decision to support or not support the "other" network - or maintain all the software for both networks.
2. Everyone would continue to "hold spendable monies" on each network. But they would not be directly spendable on the other - they are incompatible networks.
It's doubtful that companies and service providers will continue down the path of maintaining two blockchains - they will choose one of the other, which means that service is no longer available on the other network, which means it's less "valuable" or useful.
Payment processors and Exchanges would stop trading on one, continue on the other, etc. 
You could use your coins on one network to pay someone that "lives" on that network and then they are gone. How will you get your next coins to spend on that network? Will you tell your employer to pay you in network A's bitcoin network, or network B's bitcoin network? Will they even support network B?
Perhaps an exchange does decide to cater to both networks and allow the easy exchange of value between the two networks? But what happens when network B has its own hard fork, years later? 
Eventually, its only logical that one of the forks dies and the other becomes dominant because there is too much cost associated with everyone maintaining the requirements for servicing both networks.

use bitcoinpaperwallet.com to make a bip38 encrypted paper wallet. fund it with a couple thousand. keep it in your back pocket. when you need the funds, use a cold storage funtion of your bitcoin wallet to sweep a partial amount to your phone when you need it.
that way, you can securely keep a significant amount with you that is much harder for a thief to steal.
**No-so-ninja-edit:** Print out the paper copy at least twice. Store the extra copy/ies is different locations so your private keys can't really be destroyed. When I do this, I also keep an unencrypted copy in a very very safe place incase I forget the bip38 password.

When people choose different code bases/versions that are incompatible, two networks are formed when the code starts to behave differently than the other (this event is referred to as a hard fork).

Bitcoin has a 50/50 chance of going to $0 or $1,000,000. I know the correct answer, but the information is not free. Changetip me $25 for my informative video presentation and a chance to win 500btc.

But with a "global currency of the future", companies need to deal with employees that live across borders. They need to deal with settlement for goods and service across borders. Bitcoin makes that frictionless. 
What would prevent any government from accepting bitcoin as payment for taxes? There certainly are ways for them to spend those "earned/stolen" taxes in bitcoin, or they could simply use a payment service to convert them to their precious dollars.

Its effectively hashing seemingly random data [current transactions, and a link back to the previous block] to find a hash that is less than a computed value. Doing so locks older validated transactions in a chain that cannot be manipulated as more time goes on. 
People broadcasting their transactios include a small incentive to the person that solves this mining problem first. but most of the incentive comes from the miner being able to write himeself a check for doing the work. effectively, he pays himself from "nobody" in the amount of [currently] 25 bitcoins. By the money coming from "nobody" it basically inflates the currency into existence. There are strict rules that determine how much a miner can reward himself to control inflation and guarantee a well known inflation path over decades.

Bitcoin has a unit of account: The bitcoin, and smaller denominations down to a satoshi.
Bitcoin is proven to be a medium of exchange - people like me use it everyday to make purchases, get paid, etc.
Bitcoin is a store of value. Yes the value fluctuates (like some national currencies are doing right now), but everything does. And when it gets too far out of whack, I cost average because its easy for me to obtain more bitcoin.
What "specific meanings in economics" that debunk my position?

A ban on bitcoin doesn't stop the protocol. I'm all for the government banning bitcoin as every single time they've done that in the past, the banned thing's value skyrockets. The only way to kill bitcoin is to nuke everyone back to the stone age. The scary thing is, I think you'd go along with their plan because your severe case of stockholm syndrom.

It depends... If its hosted, they can shut you out for just about any reason i.e. suspicious activity. If your bitcoins are offline in keys you made yourself, you hold it, you own it.
Use a paper wallet generator like bitaddress.org or bitcoinpaperwallet.com to make your own offline keys. That's enough to get you started. When you are successful with that, come back for more.

So fire her and let her know she lost your business for not being competitive and putting her customers needs on a pedistal. Move out.
I did this the other day with my landscaper. I had politely asked that he let me show him how it works and he flat out ignored me several times for months.
So I opened the local business directory and started called new landscapers. I started with some brief small talk about my house and then popped the question like "I get part of my salary in bitcoin and would like to be able to pay you with it. If you've never heard about it or are not interested, I'll not waste either of our time and move on. Do you think that would be a possibility?"
The first 3 or four said no or "never heard of it". The next guy said he had heard about from a friend and was interested in learning more. He came to my house to give a quote and then I told him about bitcoin and he said "Sure I'll let you pay in bitcoin!"
The first thing I did was send a text to my old landscaper "services no longer needed. send last bill". He replied with "Sorry, is there anything we could have done differently?" to which I replied "Yes, but I already found a new landscaper that is excited to let me pay him in bitcoin."
Most gratifying text I'd sent all year.

Regulating bitcoin out of commerce does not stop it from being a store of value. Look at gold. Can't spend it on anything or pay your taxes. Yet people all over the world still hold it as stored value.
