Cash app, gemini, maybe checkout bittrex.
Cash app would probably be your best bet

Does anyone make or know anyone who creates logos and accepts bitcoin as payment? Sorry if this isn’t the place for this sort of question

Quick question, 
So when users decide to join the network and generate their public and private keys, does the network “remember” or store their keys? Or maybe store the fact that it did or did not generate those keys? Otherwise how would it be known that a user is using valid addresses and how would generating replica addresses be prevented?

I like this post. I suppose when some say “in it for the tech” they could also be referring to using bitcoin as a payment method but thats stretching it, there really isnt a need to cry over bitcoins price to be involved for the technology.
Smart contract platforms are different because in order to be involved with Ethereum for the technology you need to pay gas fees in Ether so that you can actually develop and interact with dapps and the blockchain. 
So I guess i could see why some care about the price of Ethereum, Neo, Etc but bitcoins price doesnt matter if you’re in it for the tech.

Question: How do developers go about improving bitcoin while keeping it decentralized? Are there rules or limitations or do some developers have more power over others? Could someone explain? Sorry for the noob question
