They could be slowly liquidating, as to not crash the price. Which is why I'm wondering if the addresses of these coins are known or if they have been effectively laundered and spread around through the BTC-e exchange.

After reading your comment, and the comments by isn't it clear that Mark himself was most likely the thief and has moved these bitcoins all over the fucking place since 2011, from wallet to wallet, in an attempt to hide their origin? 
He acknowledged transaction malleability in the past, said he spent money to fix it, and then used that as the scapegoat for shutting down the exchange in 2014. He left the deposit function open while freezing the withdrawls, stealing every last penny he could before running and declaring bankruptcy. All the while he released NO information, and led on the masses through vague updates and false hope. 
Did you see him in the bankruptcy declaration video? Grinning like a smug little rat. Close to a BILLION dollars of coins, gone. Yet he's smirking like someone who just got away with murder. 
I think he knew about the missing coins since 2011... cause he stole them. Then he ran a fractional exchange untill 2014 and then stole whatever was left on hand, followed by declaring bankruptcy. 
EDIT: and bingo was his name-o

Not only am I 100% objective on the issue, I have been following this story very closely since the withdrawl freeze, and quite honestly you would have to be a complete and utter MORON to believe anything other than he was directly involved or watched it all happen and did/said nothing.
And superstition?? Uh, try again mate.

There was an audio file taken by the hackers in the data breach, and subsequently released (thinking that it could have some important information relating to the missing bitcoin). They did not speak Japanese so they released this file in an attempt to have it translated on a popular &amp; anonymous IRC chat board. The file was translated by a Japanese speaking member who claimed that it was what sounded like a conversation between Mark (or a similar sounding non-native Japanese speaker) and a banking representative having a discussion about a discontinued account or something to that regard.
The point is that this was just a recorded phone conversation which Mark thought was important and was thus saved on the Gox servers. It was just one file among others subsequently taken in the 20gb data dump. 
The real point is that professional Russian hackers/identity thieves most likely have control of any sensitive documents, potentially bank accounts, that you submitted to Gox.

From what I understand, there were no 'books', not even a balance sheet.  Bruce Fenton claims that this is because Karpeles was incompetent, and couldn't manage the books. I on the other hand proposed that he is plenty competent, and instead lacked the proper financial paperwork intentionally, because he was committing insider fraud.
Without any proper books or paper records, can anything be determined from the blockchain alone, including using WhoIs to possibly identify the source/owner of certain wallets?

It's cool, the state of the art accounting techniques will surely pinpoint the thief, whoever he is. Those coins are all worthless now, right?? Nobody would dare spend them with our top-secret, state of the art accounting techniques tracking their every move.
You are absolutely right, it is just ludicrous to think that someone would want to steal a potential **billion dollars** worth of crypto and blame it on a hacking attack, all the while releasing no relevant information about said attack, or the coins, to the public. 
On top of that, it would then be an excellent business decision to freeze withdrawls for the exchange, while still allowing deposits for the next week. Then out of nowhere, it would be an even better idea to completely wipe the website and twitter feed with no advanced warning, for absolutely no reason, and then issue a vague general statement instead of a proper explanation.
Thinking Mark would have an interest in running away with a billion dollars worth of bitcoin is far from ludicrous. Especially if he thought he could get away with it by shifting the blame elsewhere and trying to bury the evidence in the blockchain by shuffling the coins through multiple wallets.
The truth will be revealed soon enough. For now, stop wasting my time with your blatant ignorance.

That would be fantastic, although who will prove him guilty? Clearly the authorities know next to nothing about bitcoin. I think he trusts his own knowledge and skill to allow him to successfully mask his own movements on the blockchain. That and the fact he had complete and isolated access to all of the Mt. Gox systems and the obvious assets involved. And unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with the protocol to even know where to start when it comes to obtaining solid evidence against him. Let alone getting that information into play in a Japanese court.

I used the tree function on blockchain.info... it takes a hell of a long time, but you can clearly see that Mt. Gox is up to something following this particular TX which took place on Dec. 8th 2011

If Mt. Gox actually did steal the coins, how is it a conspiracy theory? With no solid evidence one way or the other in this case, everything is technically a conspiracy theory. 
Before Snowden, if i said the Gov't was monitoring and recording all domestic communication, I'd be labeled a conspiracy theorist.

He was not making millions of dollars per week. Gox may have been making millions of dollars per week, but that gets invested back into the business, not translated into personal salary.
Work is hard. Work is stressful. 
New bitcoin exchanges entered the market, drastically reducing the market share of Gox as of late.
The Chinese had just begun withdrawing all their coins en masse from the exchange, due to a new law against bitcoin in China which was soon to take effect. Gox had been experiencing drastically declining profits because of this as well. It is alleged at this point, during the mass Chinese exodus from Gox, that the first withdraw requests were denied due to lack of funds in the Gox storage. All downhill from here (PR wise).
In reality, many of the coins had been moved in 2011 and it appears that Gox has been running a fractional exchange ever since, lying through their teeth to the bitcoin community in an attempt to keep people pumping their money in as long as possible. (some evidence in the fact that deposits were left open for nearly a week after withdrawls were frozen, and only ceased shortly prior to the entire website being wiped clean.)
Now he never has to work again. He filed for bankruptcy (clearing him of any legal obligation). He will attempt to re-brand mt. gox, or pass off to new management, in an attempt to drum up new business and use those new profits to partially pay back creditors and investors (While quite possibly using the GOX value of bitcoin rather than market value). 
This will in turn have a psychological effect on the consumers who lost bitcoin in Gox, who are suddenly very happy that they are getting *some* of their funds back where they assumed they would be getting *none*. This will take even more burden off of Karpeles, having to worry less about irate people attempting to track him down.
And after he's convinced that the public buys the whole story, he will slither off into the shadows, maybe buy some plastic surgery for that jacked up dolphin face of his, spend a little more on liposuction, and then go where ever the fuck he wants, blend in, and cash out his FORTUNE OF STOLEN BITCOINS when/where/how he deems most appropriate. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:07:41
This is honestly the only other plausible explination that makes any sort of sense to me other than Karpeles being somehow involved in their disappearance. 
... Even though I am currently leaning away from this theory because blockchain evidence shows that a large chunk of the coins originally went missing in 2011 and Gox was subsequently run as a fractional reserve until its inevitable demise in Feb. 2014.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:25:02

@_date: 2014-03-10 00:59:41
Honestly I think there is something very suspicious going on involving some of the higher-ups in the btc community. These are people who hold huge amounts of coin, and thus control a lot of the market price. There is a lot of heat on bitcoin and the blockchain right now. I wouldn't be surprised if a group of people were waiting for things to cool down, at which point a massive market dump takes place. 
Just speculation, of course, but something definitely doesn't feel right. I don't trust the btc foundation, two-bit-idiot, Gox/Karpeles, and several other people/groups/companies within the industry. There is simply too much money involved and the mixture of greed / anonymity / insider access / non regulation / lack of consequences, experienced by those who hold power positions within the industry, is not good for btc or its investors. 
EDIT: Not to mention the current and future upswing of sophisticated hacking/phishing attempts on individual customers and major exchanges. And the ability of major exchanges to abscond with large amounts of money under the veil of anonymity while using the guise of hacking as a scapegoat.

All but around 20K according to other sources I recall reading recently. That's what Karpeles allegedly said anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:12:35
"(via Joanne Heidi): It seems Karpeles is seeking a reconstruction of Empty Gox though bankruptcy proceedings and to pay back account holders partially with a reconstructed company. If true, it continues the blueprint copycat scam."
"Copycat Scam?
According to an anonymous high-profile source, the first and original bitcoin scam was the online coin wallet Mybitcoin.com. People would deposit hundreds of thousands of coins there, as the currency was new and hundreds of thousands of coins weren’t yet worth a lot.
Then, on July 29, 2011, the site went blank, just like the Gox website did. People panicked and gradually accepted a catastrophic loss of funds.
On August 11, 14 days later, the site came back online and declared – just like Gox – that they “had been hacked”, had filed for bankruptcy protection, just like Gox, but “had managed to recover” 49% of the funds. People could fill out claim forms to recover these funds – 49% of their original balance. As this was enough time for most people to internalize the loss, they were happy again at the sudden windfall; things suddenly weren’t as bad as they had seemed. In the meantime, the anonymous person who ran mybitcoin.com disappeared with a huge amount of money, according to the source.
In other words, the scam cynically exploited people’s loss and grief to actually make them happy when they got something back. Most “hacks” of bitcoin sites since then have actually been copycat scams of mybitcoin.com, again according to this source. If – repeat, if Empty Gox is executing a copycat scam, we should expect the site to offer their clients a portion of the holdings back, a portion probably lower than 50% (just to drive the point home), and that offer should appear on or about March 11, 2014. Time will tell.
The one key difference between mybitcoin.com and MtGox would be that Mark Karpeles is not anonymous, which would make for a very poor execution of a copycat scam."

It is sad, because it only takes one lie to get a good idea of how sincere and honest someone will be in the future. I can't even count the number of bullshit excuses that have come out of Mark's mouth in the past month alone. I guess that's why he tends to keep his mouth shut, he can only bullshit for so long before he incriminates himself.
And now Gox is going to re-brand in an attempt to repay creditors (AT A SEVERLY DEPLETED FRACTIONAL RATE THAT GOX ITSELF IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHEN IT KEPT IT'S DEPOSIT AND TRADE FUNCTIONS OPEN FOR A WEEK+ WHILE FREEZING WITHDRAWALS AND RELEASING NO REAL INFORMATION??)
Gee, I wonder why the price of Gox coins dropped to $100..
When and how is this guy going to be held accountable for his fuck up's/deceit? It's disgusting. And it is TERRIBLE for bitcoin. Even if the price holds steady, whats to stop the next guy from doing the same thing. And the next guy... and the next...
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:01:33
I didn't even lose any coins w/ Gox, and yet I would describe it more as infuriating. The only people who should be laughing about this are those who got away with the money. Even if you didn't have coins in Gox at the time of their freeze, this event has greatly effected the overall value of bitcoin and led to decreased consumer confidence (whether valid or not) and a whole lot of fuel for future negative press. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:13:08
I have no doubt that the 430k is leaving Mt. Gox in one way or another... but it seems like its slowly being siphoned off the top each time Gox switches wallets, which seems to be quite often after this particular date. 
It looks like Karpeles tried to make the blockchain as confusing as possible to follow after Dec 8th 2011, and starts really mixing and matching gox coins to hundreds of different wallets.
Then all of a sudden we have movement while the US is asleep, and the media is focused on Satoshi, of coins which Gox isn't even supposed to have anymore!

Isn't the fact that there was no balance sheet (and never has been a balance sheet) a HUGE red flag in itself that those in charge are involved in fraud/coverup? You can't run a billion-dollar business with no record of finances. Mark is smart enough to know this, so there must have been a specific reason why the finances were not recorded properly. I don't see many valid reasons accounting for this fact, other than those relating to fraud and deceit on some level.

Not attempting to mislead anybody through the use of the term 'security keys'.
I am attempting to point out the possibility that the SSL key exploit could be used to gain sensitive bitcoin related information from the websites of bitcoin mining pools / exchanges / wallets etc. 
That is not even taking into account the ability to exploit personal computers / routers etc. as a means to obtain sensitive bitcoin related data.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:14:17
YES he would take all the coins, or as many as he could. 
Gox was dying, near death due to the 150K+ coins that were stolen in 2011, and it was running as a fractional reserve ever since. With the emergence of new exchanges and the en masse withdrawl of Chinese coins from Gox, the exchange was quickly becoming unsustainable. 
The first failed withdrawal attempt marked the beginning of the end of their public image, and that's when I believe their master exit strategy truely went into effect. 
What thief would only take a fraction of the coins in an accessed wallet? Clearly that would be suspicious. Taking them all allows for him to place the blame on someone else, aka 'hackers'.
And gag order? Japanese courts stated pre-bankruptcy that they had no jurisdiction over Mt. Gox and were not getting involved. If Gox is in Japan, and Karpeles is not a US citizen, then the USA has no jurisdiction either. So who would impose this proposed gag order?
It is obvious Mark is somehow involved, if only through his super shady behavior, outright lies, and complete lack of relevant information released to the public. 
People are committing suicide over their losses.
Even if Mark didn't steal the coins himself, what's to stop him from contracting a separate hacker to do the dirty work, giving him relevant information on how to steal the coins, and then splitting the pot with him at a later date?
What's to stop you, or any other high profile bitcoin personality from being bribed into collusion to help steal, or facilitate the theft of, the coins?
Why are you so keen to not pass judgement on Mark, when literally everything he does is suspicious and wreaks of fraud &amp; deceipt?

The fact that the bitcoins are where they're supposed to be is contradictory to the statement Mark gave at the bankruptcy filing claiming, "they are mostly gone".
I don't think Mark counted on anyone tracking down the coins so quickly through the blockchain. I hope this thread takes off, then it will be interesting to see how this all plays out. Hopefully it ends with Mark in some sort of federal prison or torture camp. Cockmeat sandwich type shit.

I was watching the IRC chat when that user originally posted an audio file of mark speaking to the bank in japanese, which was obtained in the data breach. Said user also indicated that the information was in the hands of a Russian hacking group. 
Also, around the same time, a user reported receiving a fraudulent phone call to his private Gox phone number which attempted to extort bitcoin through a phony investment pitch. The phone number originated from Russia.
It looks like a credible threat to me.

From what I understand, Mark is a very intelligent man who can speak at least 3 languages fluently, knows how to code, knows how to program. He had the foresight to get involved with bitcoin in 2011 and turn Mt. Gox into a multi-billion dollar trading platform.

Unfortunately, not everyone knew it was coming. Or if they did know, some had hope that they would eventually be able to pull their coins out of Gox. In light of these recent events, all hope is now lost in that regard. This will play a roll in dropping the price of Bitcoin on other exchanges because up until this point, that loss was speculative. Now, that loss is definite, and the market will adjust to account for peoples fears/concerns relating to the overall security of Bitcoin and its related exchanges. That is why many of the other top exchanges were so quick to release a joint press release stating that the insolvency issues faced by Mt. Gox are not representative of Bitcoin or the Bitcoin industry as a whole.

This doesn't mean anything? 
It means that Mt. Gox/Karpeles is in control of 180,000 coins, when they publicly claimed to only have 20,000.
People were all *assuming* these coins were connected to Gox yesterday, and now OP is showing proof of that fact. Thank you, OP. This is very important and relevant information.
Save the hot wallet bullshit, that guess is even more reckless than saying Mark stole them. There is actual evidence that Mark has previously been charged and convicted of computer systems fraud. There is evidence that Mark has released NOTHING in regard to truthful, useful information relating to the cause of this whole Gox implosion.
As far as evidence that this is all for a hot wallet, there is actually evidence to the contrary in that the newly divided coins do not seem to be following the original source code and many tree branches contain ending wallets with numerous confirmations which contain far more than the coded ~10 btc per wallet.

Which is 2 months before Mt. Gox was shut down. The most recent figures regarding this particular theft are 744K-ish coins 'stolen' from account holders, and the remaining 100K were 'stolen' from Karpeles. That makes a total of 844K-ish coins that were reported 'stolen' in this theft, in the latest reports.
If what you say is true about Karpeles holding 200K coins in December 2013, then things just got even more suspicious as it seems he must have transfered/withdrawn 100K of own his personal coins between Dec 2013 and Feb 2014 (2 months). Coincidence, right?

Those who lost bitcoins due to this latest Mt. Gox issue had their coins in storage within Mt. Gox. It is not recommended for anyone to store their coins long term within any crypto exchange. Unless you plan on buying/selling/trading in the immediate future, you SHOULD NOT keep your coins in ANY exchange longer than short-term. 
The safest way to store your coins is to pull them offline and keep the unique encryption key(s) in a paper wallet or offline wallet alternative. The paper wallet can then be treated like cash or any other valuable and stored in a secure location, like a safe. 
There are certainly steps which can be taken to ensure that your bitcoins are secure and the unique ID's are safe from thieves/hackers etc.
If you had been paying attention to the details from day 1, there were numerous red flags that were raised regarding the unprofessional operating procedures of Mt. Gox.
If you are smart about it and do your research, there are valid ways to keep your bitcoins secure. The market value of said coins, however, will continue to be susceptible to volatility as long as the various crypto-currency exchanges lack any sort of regulation or accountability.

It could be an attempt to muddy up the blockchain, making the paths of individual coins more difficult to follow. Of the 32 final (for now) addresses, even those with the lowest holdings are still worth 2+ million dollars.

How does one go about nabbing a suspect when they most likely transcend international boundaries? What authority would have the jurisdiction to pursue such a criminal? With the office located in Japan, the Japanese police would certainly have no right to pursue any sort of investigation outside of Japan, right? From what I understand, it is not possible to trace a wallet to it's owner. Unless these coins were taken by Mark himself, I don't think he has any idea who is responsible. In fact, his consistent lies and cover up's lead me toward the belief that he was somehow involved.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:46:18

I was under the impression 744k-ish coins were 'stolen' from Mt.Gox customers while the remaining 100k 'stolen' was held by Karpeles.

So you found the one definition that didn't involve magic, witches, and the general supernatural... good job, buddy!
It's too bad my opinions on Karpeles are influenced by both reason and knowledge, as I have been following this story closely since the withdrawl freeze, every step of the way. 
But since you obviously know better, why don't you tell us what happened to the coins, as Mark himself has neglected to say anything more than a "hacking attack". 
Do you think a hacker stole the coins? Is the government going to track him with state of the art accounting techniques too? :(

he stole your money people. or facilitated the theft of your money. wake up.

Can you or Arthur comment on the current fundraising initiative, which is raising bitcoin for Dorian?
At the time of this writing, they have raised around $25,000 worth of btc!
I know you have previously stated that "no money is needed", however I hope you will persuade Dorian to accept these funds as a token of good faith, if nothing more. 
After these recent events, I would not be surprised if he never wants to hear the word 'bitcoin' again. Hopefully, the Nakamoto's will see that despite the media circus, many within the community still have good hearts. 
Cheers to many years of free lunches!
EDIT: and a big THANK YOU to everybody who has donated to the cause!

Man, some people in this thread are ignorant. It's Karpeles and its been Karpeles from the start. Hopefully this ends with him in jail and assets recovered, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. 
If you're still defending Karpeles and believe he's innocent, you've got your head lodged firmly in your own ass.

Would you care to enlighten me as to why you find this particular source non-credible? Alas, I am unfamiliar with how they handled the Pirate Bay story.

Payout some of their debts, by transferring a bulk of coins that they claim not to have anymore, into 20 or so separate wallets containing smaller denominations? Yea, I'm sure that's the case. Go ahead and keep thinking Karpeles is anything other than a con man.

Moral is, get a new bank and spread the word in this community and others in regard to which bank you currently use, so that others can stop using them as well.
Not sure what/if the "credit union" equivalent would be in the UK, but those are always a better option than a big name bank in nearly every way.

I think the leaker is releasing information which is in the hands of an Russian hacker/identity theft ring. I think he is rogue in that he wants to try and use what information he has access to in order to try and figure out who took the coins. There is another thread in which a Gox account holder claimed to get a call from a Russian phone number trying to find "investors" for a new "business venture". Personal information of Gox users has been compromised. Plan accordingly.

Those seem like terrible odds. Not being familiar with the casino, what was he playing that he felt confident betting 330 coins for the chance to only win 100? And subsequently betting 100 just to win 3?
@_date: 2015-07-20 00:44:15
It's tough because there's not a lot of Bitcoin owners out there, in proportion to non-bitcoin owners. And many of those who do hold, are doing so long term, not readily spending. Also, because of the inconvenience and security risk associated with 3rd parties, many people will shy away from a Bitcoin transfer when there are other viable alternatives (cash, money order, check, credit, Paypal, etc.)
There needs to be some serious changes (at a society and infrastructure level) before you can expect frequent Bitcoin payments while working in an industry not at all related to Bitcoin.

Nice, thanks. I looked it up on Google Earth, that's really out in the middle of nowhere. Closer to Turkey than the mainland of Greece. It's gonna take a lot more than the initial 4.5 mil to set up a power grid and infrastructure. Transportation to and from would be crazy expensive as well.
