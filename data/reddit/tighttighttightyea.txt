If we learned anything from CME/CBOE "accepting Bitcoin" fiasco, is that they have much more to gain from it than we do.
It will be heavily regulated and favoring institutions instead of decentralization and freedom of investment.
If Bitcoin continues to grow, it will happen sooner or later, and we will have that "ETF approved" milestone. Sooner it happens, more control they will get.

You do not invest X$ in mining to get X.05$ after a while.
You invest X$ in hardware that, at current rate, makes X฿ at the cost of power and maintenance in $.
If you have free electricity, and maintain hardware yourself, you are making profit on each chain, no matter what.
The difference suggested is that ROI for mining Bitcoin is 2.66X less than BCH. Which is great, but since mining is investing in long term revenue, you need to take into account much larger timespan than current profitability.
You can't just put $1000 in "mining" and take out $1050 tomorrow.

There are 1001 good reason for "selling" (they ain't really selling it, y'know...) mining operation. The question is why would anyone who is even slightly knowledgeable buy that shit.  
Not to be confused with buying hashrate for specific algo, like nicehash market, that had real-life use.
@_date: 2019-06-18 10:07:19
Mining contract does not correlate to Bitcoins, but to hashrate over X period of time. So if you were really going to earn more with mining than if you were to buy Bitcoin, do you really think they would be renting it out? On the other hand, its 1002nd good reason to "sell" mining contracts.  
If you've read ANYTHING about cryptocurrencies, you would know that you shouldn't be trusting your money with anyone except yourself. Especially do not give your money to 3rd parties trusting their reputation and honesty.  
At worst, buy some shitcoin that is stakeable, at least you are protected by protocol...

I agree that it is absolutely good idea at any time to rent hashing power, in exchange for cryptocurrency right now. There is practically no situation where it would be bad idea.  
Whether it is a scam or not, is totally different thing to discuss. Genesis Mining has a clause in their lifelong contracts that it gets cancelled if mining gets unprofitable for certain period, they were sure it would come sooner or later. So best you've got on them is false advertising, and even that is a stretch.  
My original point was there is practically no situation where BUYING hashrate for certain coin would be profitable, instead of just buying that coin. Again, not to be confused with open markets for hashrate.

@_date: 2017-04-09 19:49:01


Exactly my point, but biggest thing throttling Bitcoin advancement right now is single organization that has too much power in this ecosystem. Even if they were pro-Bitcoin, it would be a problem.
Before, we had MtGox which had 90% of trading volume, their downfall was such a throwback for Bitcoin. Now, we have single entity which makes 90% of miners. If they, to say the least, stopped making new miners, it would be bad for Bitcoin.
This could be solved by having more competitive companies making miners, but that is very unlikely because of unfair advantages that Bitmain currently have. That is why the best thing would be to have something that is widely distributed, and not made specifically for mining.
What I would propose, is at least to start experimenting with additional PoW algorithm, some alt's already have it implemented and it hasn't broken them. It would take extensive testing, but that is what community is here for!

Finding the best way to make mining available for all should be our top priority.

I beg to differ, BU leaders want us to think that we are divided, and to use that to gain more power themselves. People will always critically think, and that is a good thing, but we should not let obvious good things drift by just because we haven't solved every possible problem with it.
Currently, the community is split like this (totally my seeing of it, not a fact): 
1% - Devs
89% - Community supporting and reviewing devs
1% - BU Leaders
9% - People tricked by BU Leaders that they are doing good for Bitcoin by supporting them.

Uh, it's hard to explain as ELI5,  especially because you should not trust any one person telling you anything about this matter.
In my opinion (shared by at least 50% of Reddit community) this is good news because one of biggest pools stopped signaling that they will switch to alternative Bitcoin client in about a month. Which is good because switching would weaken Bitcoin security due to lower hashrate.

He ain't a scumbag either, he is egocentric individual who doesn't care about anything but his own wealth.
Everything he says is with the aim of getting himself richer, with no regard to anybody other than himself. That's why he can troll and lie so good, that the best way to fight that is to ignore him as much as possible.

@_date: 2017-05-09 01:56:54
I think they differ on so many levels. Bitcoin is still high risk, high reward investment. 
Not because Dollar will somehow take over, and people will see brighter future in it. But because everything is so fast paced in crypto world, that we cannot even imagine how much more advanced will it be in 5-10 years, and which technology is going to lead.
After all, Bitcoins market share of cryptos is at all time low. (Don't get me wrong, I see this as a good thing, another layer of decentralized security)

Anti-SegWit propaganda. Even if it wouldn't solve scaling problem, we should still activate it. It's such an innovative and useful technology.
On the separate note, I am not against increasing block size, I am just against centralized Chinese mining who will benefit the most from just 1MB --&gt; 2MB, centralizing mining even more.
That would be bad in the long term even for you. And if you can't work with high fees on Bitcoin network, there are other fish in the sea, try some alt that will suit your case the best. That will also give incentive to bitcoiners to solve scaling faster if they want to keep you loyal.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:33:37
Shill saying to stop shilling? Well, ain't that ironic?
The problemS we are currently having cannot be resolved by simple block size increase, and you already know that.

Maybe earlier.

I am pretty sure whoever is behind Satoshi pseudonym, already had enough money for whatever they needed even before Bitcoin whitepaper was released.
Bitcoin started from no money invested, just the idea to be fair and equal for everyone.
If you found cure for cancer, would you hide it from everyone for 2B dollars? I guess not. They probably see it as their greatest achevement for the better of humanity, no amount of money can buy that eternal bliss.
Or maybe they want to buy a small country instead of exotic islands, so need to hodl a bit longer...

@_date: 2017-07-24 18:27:00
They will have, like, 10% of transaction volume, so 200kb block size would be enough.
If they don't continue development after blocksize limit increase, they are doomed for becoming obsolete. But I am sure they will work on faster transactions, and other improvements that more centralized government allows.
We will see how it plays out, for now, there is no need to use it ever, instead of Bitcoin or some other altcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:32:35

@_date: 2017-07-08 11:36:07
Bitcoin has overcome current monetary systems with ingenoius solutions for many problems. Don't you think that some time in the future there will be new piece of technology even more advanced, that it will overcome Bitcoin?
Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, but it could get stale quickly (in matter of years) if you let single entity hold veto on upgrades.
And let's not even get started on the mess that would be created with POW change (although I support it, it's very tricky to do with minimal casualties).
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:36:47
Hope so as well. xD
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:40:20
They won't accept that offer because they value their altcoin less than 50% of current Bitcoin. Which means even they agree that economic majority is on our side, so it should be safe to fork without any real risk. 
On the other hand, you selling SegWit8MB coins for any real value, makes you approve of actual worth of their coin at that exact price. If you are dumping them without caring for the price, I'll take all of them at the price of 1 real satoshi each. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:29:40
Wouldn't it be obvious that they are doing it,  so we can quickly crowdfund someone to blow up their mining farms before it is too late?

10 hours ago? Old news, it's happening! :D
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:36:04
If that is true, then Bitcoin is in a huge bubble. We've got a lot of people looking for fast and easy money, invested in Bitcoin, that will sell sooner or later dropping the price more than it rose when they bought in the first place. We will be just speeding up the process with a fork. We should not have celebrated new ATH's because uneducated people, we don't want as part of the community, were investing for wrong reasons.
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:07:07
Have a pint, wait for all of this to blow over. We've got amazing developers, it will get sorted out, just needs a bit more time in decentralized systems like this.

Dump all of your money into PASL. Just trust me on this one. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:29:58
1MB is not "artificial ceiling damaging the scalability and being bottleneck". It was intended to be protection against cheap spam attacks and supporting decentralization. We could remove maximum block size completely, allowing up to infinite transactions per block solving scaling problems forever. But guess why wouldn't it work. 
Also, here we are talking about ~10 entities which together possess about 80% of the hashrate that signed non-obligatory agreement. It's not 80% of userbase, developers or economic majority.

Is Monero really that anonymous? Isn't ringct just tumbling done with every transaction, and, if given enough incentive, can be broken?

When Bitcoins get lost (currently estimated at about ~1m, not counting Satoshis coins) the value of coins you hold increases by a fraction. Even since the begging Satoshi though of this problem, and optimized Bitcoin to be divisible to 8 more denominations when needed. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:04:50
It depends on your understanding of fairness. To me, having certain rules that cannot be bended or broken no matter what, and apply equally to everyone involved, no matter who, is fair.
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:35:02
Why would you say so? I've been learning Java for a while now, it was easy to pick up and do simple to mid complexity stuff. Is it really getting out of fashion? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:13:25
How are you so sure about that? I don't see any important figures (Exchanges, online stores, ATMs...) supporting it in high numbers.
Not that I am against it, though.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:27:52
Yeah, that is because you can't fire developers with a soft forked client. You can hire new ones only with a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:52:27
Well, Jihan is not a developer, he does not have technical knowledge to write code for a client.
However, company Bitmain, that he is chairman of, can financially support independent developers who would like to work on different client for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:47:00
That would be true if all miners had same incentives. If that was the case to begin with, we would never even have this discussion.
Bitmain, as a centralized entity, would be more than willing to mine their chain at expense for some time, if that meant long term acceptance (so would I).
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:24:29
But it is more like 8MB because of reasons, but we shouldn't even care because we ain't using this 1MB we currently got the best we can.
It is not "block capacity" or "scaling bottleneck" of 1MB. That 1MB limit is there to block cheap spam attacks on the network. We could just as easily remove it completely and have theoretically up to infinite transactions per block solving scaling problems forever. But you don't want that.
This stopped being technical problem the moment technical solution was found (L2 scaling, LN, MAST). And became a political one for the influence and control of decentralized system called Bitcoin. 
Right now, 75% of mining network fell under that influence, Satoshi help us. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:07:59
You have no rights to do anything about it, and I would like to see how they plan to scale Bitcoin on chain. It is much healthier for them to do it on another chain,  rather than current one. 
And it won't split at 50/50 value, the market will show. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:57:31
Cuz whole America wakes at the same time.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:43:39
We still don't have decentralized exchanges even for real Bitcoin trades. Still relaying on exchanges engine to enforce trade happening. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:57:52
Make a guess... 
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:53:10
I think Bitcoin got broken when mining hardware production got centralized. It was inevitable for someone to make ASICs, but that is the problem of protocol, which can be fixed.
It would help, but only as a short term band aid.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:20:16
In that case, Bitcoin is already forked between community. They just happen to follow same rules for now, so one network is currently indistinguishable from the other.
So, the problem is that the protocol allows someone holding significant part of mining network, to intentionally stall upgrades. Essentially holding everyone hostage, and even threat attacking real Bitcoin if we let them go. 
The risk of attack can be mitigated by having PoW switch ready before it is even possible to do so.
And the hostage situation is problem of a part of our community, that would rather compromise to keep them from splitting (probably buying the bubble they caused) instead of letting them go, as they are obviously hurting whole community for personal gains, and will likely continue doing so. 
The good thing is that after we overcome this issue once, the community will grow significantly more resilient to similar risks, spotting them sooner and resolving it with less impact. Then, even BIP9 could be useful for convenient upgrades.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:49:33

In my opinion, Bitcoin is too safe of an investment for  "spare £400" you've got. I would rather recommend you to pick a couple of "new and perspective" alt-coins and wait for 5-10X profits.
Fun to check while drinking morning coffee, tea or whatever.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:00:26
Why do you think so? I think that is the greatest advantage of decentralized cryptos in general, ability to quickly change and adapt. Ethereum probably won't bring peace to the World, but it showed us that cryptos can be much more than just a currency.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:31:33

But it's a general rule of thumb. ICO's are so far away from general idea of cryptocurrency. It's only good for traders and people trying to get rich quickly with high risk investment.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:15:31
Yes, but isn't there a risk that something even greater than Bitcoin will emerge from it, and make Bitcoin obsolete?
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:48:25
That is why you should never buy Ripple, it's a private blockchain made to be used by affiliate parties to keep records between them. It was not meant to be used by random people to buy stuff or transact.
Maybe not away from "crypto currencies" in general, but from what Bitcoin stands for, yes, far away.
