Do we have different definitions of shutting down a computer?

I'm pretty sure there are other businesses that utilize servers...It might not be as simple as BTC mining, but it's still a possibility.

Hacking a real bank's website would gather a lot more attention.  You'd have the bank itself, which is a lot more powerful than Mt Gox, the government, and the media all of your ass.  And BTC being so much less traceable makes it a lot easier for a criminal to launder the money and send it to themselves.

Wouldn't you rather pay for a few tickets in a raffle than just straight give away some BTC in fees?
@_date: 2011-03-23 13:25:43
That was very informative.

I'm really hoping that he's either really wealthy, and can suffer the loss all right...or that he got into bitcoin in it's infancy, and only had 500K "on paper."

You think CPU mining would work better than GPU mining on the netbook?  Or does it work in conjunction with the GPU?  A few dollars a month could be worth it, especially if BTC keeps rising...I would think it would cost at most about $10 a month in electricity to just leave the netbook running.
Thanks for the info on the low end PCs, too.  I need a little project, and something that has the potential to earn me some money or goodies sounds good.

TIL about Ripple

Thanks, the netbook sounds like it could be put to better uses then.
I'm curious, do you game at all?  Is it reasonable to mine while reading reddit or not using the PC, then pause the miner to play some games, and then resume mining?  Or do you even have to pause, would the game just take precedence over the bit coin miner?  Right now I have an radeon 4670...not great, but it could probably do something worthwhile at least.

Used carb0n13's.  Mine is [

What I think is interesting is that the people who build the first user friendly, widely accepted tools are the ones that will get the richest most likely.  Like the guy who sells shovels and pick axes during a gold rush, instead of mining it himself.

Your expected value is actually best with solo mining, the problem is that for most rigs it would take years on average to make their first 50BTC...and by that time it may no longer be 50BTC and the difficulty may have risen so much that you'll never find anything.
You don't have to allocate anything to the bitlotto pool, but it's definitely not as large of a gamble as solo mining.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:59:13
Well to be fair, all pools start small.  They've only been up since June 8th according to the wiki page.  It's at 3Gh/s now.

Actually I have bid random cents above a dollar amount on ebay.  I haven't traded on MTGox at all, so maybe it would've dawned on me if I had been an active trader.
@_date: 2011-06-10 17:21:16
Awesome, thanks!
Yikes, an atom doesn't even reach 1Mhash/s!
@_date: 2011-06-14 12:46:17


That's one of the most elegant ways to go about this, really.
@_date: 2011-06-11 04:19:34
I was wondering the same thing, actually.  According to the bitcoin wiki the pool has only been around for a couple of days, I get the impression the site is still being worked on.
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:29:23
I don't think I would've thought to buy at .0101 instead of just .01, though.  At least not in the heat of the moment, having trouble refreshing the page like he did.
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:23:10
The wiki linked in another reply here says I'd get about 36MHash/s...which is not spectacular, but still worth doing, I gather.
As for pausing the miner, I was wondering if it has a negative effect even after you restart it?  I'm not too sure of the inner workings, does it literally just pause and resume right where it left off, or is it possible that you paused it in the middle of a big operation and it has to start all over again when you get around to restarting the miner?
EDIT:  I also have an on board 3200 GPU that I don't use...I wonder if I could use that for mining at the same time as the 4670, and even while gaming...interesting prospect.

It sounds like something out of mario?  *MARIO!?*
@_date: 2011-05-10 00:27:53
Sorry, I have to agree with some of the other posters in this thread.  At this time, tipping with BTC is just pointless and you will probably be perceived to be just as annoying and forward as the people who "tip" religious literature.
@_date: 2011-07-01 13:39:47
That's a good point, but you can pay for the fast internet with the money saved on video cards ;-)
