I'm sure he'll just have to pay 5 weeks profits to take care of this little fiasco, oh wait...

For a second I thought this was a comment on r/funny

We were sharing an apartment, she 19, me 21 I think and was working through winter at best buy (bad idea with the 50% discount as a tech person) as a gap semester to save up before moving back to campus for school. I had to explain how the electric bill was impacted most and we had an electric water heater which the yellow tag on it indicated it used about $50/mo and our a/c was next after that

Oh true, I used to work at a drug and alcohol rehab a few years ago and either whataboutism or passing the blame was a normal thing. The time between the getting the BTC and it peaking around 19k/20k was a good while so there was no real way of knowing it'd take off like it did

Damn right. There is a huge chance once that 75 turned into like 100 I'd have cashed out. 21 year old me would've bragged like a vegan diet changed my life

Yeah. Life ruined

I don't mean it maliciously, we laugh about it. Not a mean-spirited post...

If you want, add into your post about how this whole country's issues have even spilled out into the runescape economy

Should have been more clear in the post/title. Just was scrolling through my history looking for a reputation thread and saw this, no ill-will (if that's hyphenated or not)

Everyday I turn to my girlfriend and say "well, looks like bitcoin is $x,xxx each. I still hate my sister." 
Context: I traded a fancy RAZR keyboard I got free from working at best buy for a little over a half a bitcoin and my sister needed me to pitch in for bills and I sold that for about $75 which was about the price at the time.

Females aren't bitcoin friendly. Scientific data here fellas

Definitely, I've been on the outside looking in for a while but since I'll actually have my own money in this I'll try to keep everything as close to me as possible. What I'm curious about is the qr codes to scan that the app I use has, are qr codes scannable and redeemed that way to get bitcoins?

If im going to be getting mbtc will a BTC wallet still work or are they separate currencies? 
@_date: 2013-10-07 04:34:38
Using Android app, no sidebar. Pardon my convenience.
@_date: 2013-10-07 04:44:53
Phew ok thanks, so is there usually a fee or loss going from BTC to usd? I'm considering just converting when I get paid them since I need the money more than an investment right now
@_date: 2013-10-07 04:53:33
Thanks very much, I'm so excited to finally get into the Bitcoin world!
@_date: 2013-07-15 05:39:16
What is that? 
@_date: 2013-10-07 05:40:14
Oh ok well I just downloaded the Bitcoin app on Android and emailed and stored the keys to my Bitcoin on my Dropbox and Gmail account so I like the idea of the bitcoins and access only through my cell phone, isint that the best way to do it? Keep it physically on you? 
@_date: 2013-06-27 20:01:05
Wow super Upvote for you man, so in person might be a good idea but uhhh where would I post to find local bitcoin sellers? Craigslist or something? Also I can't use my paypal account to buy since I have some money there? 
@_date: 2013-06-27 20:17:00
Sorry I'm on mobile using an android app that doesn't show sidebar but I'll check it 
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:31:12
Ok thanks I appreciate it
