This is very neat. I was wondering what you used to design these concepts? I was working with a friend on an app concept earlier this year and we could never really make our flow drafts look this good.

As someone who is entrepreneurial-minded but fascinated by bitcoin, I think the biggest thing is I just don't really have a good understanding of what's going on so it's hard to even realize that there are needs let alone realize that there are ways to capture those needs.

Well, speaking for myself, (and this is probably a decent representation of more people) I know bitcoin is exciting and a lot of people are excited about it. I think I lack the sort of sophisticated understanding of the concept to be able to start seeing applications... I can think of a few without too much proprietary content but I think this post kind of nailed it on the head; the people who have the insight to truly innovate are the coders and developers.
I guess one specific question would be: How does a business go about adopting bitcoin? I know more and more businesses accept it but does it require a third party? Is their any demand for a way to use bitcoin like a physical credit card for mobile payments?
