This is like when Canters Deli put Cherry Pie on sale the day after Jani Lane (singer of Warrant) died. They advertised it using his name.

He actually sounds like an asshole (read backwards-up)
As part owner, I have admin access to Blockchain.info,  so depending on the notification settings you have for your wallet there, I can look up accounts based on a Bitcoin address.  %100 for sure that bitcoin address is owned and controlled by you,  and you received the funds from me.
Now do the right thing and send them back:
4.5119 BTC to 18yDbzddGVEr1Vyp4NXrP6mqAmUTesAg9a 
Once you do that,  I will delete the rest of your information from this public thread and we can both put this behind us.
I caught you %100 red handed lying about this.
For those who are interested,  here is the full support ticket history.  Read it from the bottom to top:
Roger TODAY 08:23 PM
Should I consider this a threat that should be turned over to the authorities?
I'm still waiting for your lawyer's contact information.
Roger TODAY 07:37 PM
When can I have your lawyer's contact details? 
As promised, I have made this public for the world to know exactly what you have done: 
With the best intentions, (unlike you)
Roger Ver
Roger TODAY 06:48 PM
I will gladly contact your lawyer about this. 
Please provide his contact details.
Thank you,
Roger Ver
Nethead TODAY 06:40 PM
You are on block list, you will only speak with my lawyer for what you have done so far. Everything is logged. Subject closed
Nethead TODAY 06:26 PM
Your mail does not prove anything, anyone can mail to anyone from any domain you want. Expose me? Do it. 
You have failed my friend because you shouldnt touch that information, BlockChain TOS does not say so as of today. I know i didnt touch your bitcoins. ITS your fault that you added the address i gave you on the payment system, not mine. So if you say that you are a co-owner and you still say its a permanent address then i do not have anything else to say. Do whatever you want, but be careful where you put my information, thats a little hint.
Have a nice day man i hope you get your bitcoins.  
As of now im out of this game
Roger TODAY 06:16 PM
To prove to you my ownership stake in blockchain.info, I just sent you an email from my roger email address.
Do the right thing and send me back my money.
Nethead TODAY 06:02 PM
I know the name "Roger", but EVEN if you OWN (which you do not) you SHOULDNT toutch ANY personal info. Both bitcoinstore AND blockchain (which YOU involved) are in trouble. I dont get it "my last chance"? "to make my life easier"? Explain
As i said i do not have OR had any of your money. I really hope i didnt ever came to your failstore.
Roger TODAY 05:56 PM
Nethead, I own 25% of blockchain.info 
I also own 15% of Bitinstant.com 
%100 of Bitcoinstore.com 
%100 or Memorydealers.com 
I also own a % of coinlab.com, ripple.com ogrr.com and I am the largest single donor to bitcoinfoundation.org
I'm Roger Ver, the post prolific Bitcoin investor the world has ever seen: 
Stop trying to steal from me, I caught you %100.
This is your final chance to do the right thing and send my money back.
18yDbzddGVEr1Vyp4NXrP6mqAmUTesAg9a (4.5119 BTC)
Do it now, and both our lives will be easier, and you will be a better person for it.
With the very best intentions,
Roger Ver
Nethead TODAY 05:44 PM
I said what is true, you are not part-owner on blockchain, i do not have or ever had your money, annddd i said what is going to happen
Have a nice day sir, except if you have anything else to add
Roger TODAY 05:42 PM
I didn't get into any of your mail logs or your server. 
I'm part owner of Blockchain.info so I can see all the addresses in your wallet, and I caught you red handed in your lie.
You have my money, and you need to send it right now to 18yDbzddGVEr1Vyp4NXrP6mqAmUTesAg9a (4.5119 BTC)
Stop lying, stop wasting both of our time, and send me back my money.
Thank you,
Roger Ver
Nethead TODAY 05:38 PM
You are going to get fined, blockchain will be involved in this. What you sent IS personal information, does not prove anything else than you are trying to threaten me, you shouldnt have that, and everything is against you.
Once again, i do not have your money, but you definitely deserved that, if i had them i would return them, i would return your fault back.
Your fine WILL exceed 10000 BTC if you want to talk in bitcoins.
Now do you have anything else to add?
Nethead TODAY 04:49 PM
Dude now you are in terrible trouble for getting to my mail (logs on MY server) AND stealling my wallet (also logged), before i sent this i have spoken to my lawyer and got all your information from your website. Also printscreened YOU sending MY information. This was not a permanent address, so you know you are in trouble.
Wait call from my lawyer
All that info is logged
Roger TODAY 04:36 PM
I looked up your address with Blockchain, and %100 for sure the funds were sent to a Bitcoin address that you control.

I'm sorry Zlatko made the mistake in refunding you too much money to begin with. 
Thank you for doing the right thing and returning the money,

What anonymous receiving address service were you using?
Thank you,

WOW thats kinda sad, for both of us because it was an anonymous receiving address from my online wallet. Should I give my permanent address to forward payments to??? It would be great!!
I didnt receive anything, someone else got lucky today, but let me remind you thats its your fault in the first place that you didnt want to sent me what i bought. Im not lying here, that is my real name here and im from my real ip address.
Zlatko Bijelic TODAY 11:46 AM
I hope that you are doing well.
You may have noticed that you received about 4.50932664 BTC coins today (2012-12-19 01:35:38) - this was due to a mistake on our end by giving the customer an incorrect Bitcoin Address for payment. I would like to ask if you can send us those Bitcoins?
Thank you in advance, I hope that you have a great day!
