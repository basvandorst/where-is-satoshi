Not disputing your underlying sentiment about low-quality content, but if you were truly around in early 2013, I’m not sure which r/bitcoin you were on, but you must have somehow missed all the Spartan memes. It was just as bad, only HODL was still spelled HOLD. Honestly, I think the memes are much more varied now. Vegeta/DBZ was a nice blast to the past. But I’ll agree that there is a strong inverse correlation between price volatility and technical content quality.

Not to be too cynical, but this being your only post on this account doesn't exactly inspire confidence.

Not necessarily no relation, but maybe not a huge one.  When the price of BTC in fiat is high, the venture's expenses denominated in fiat (whether ongoing operational expenses, or expenses pertaining to reinvestment in the venture) are lower (in BTC).  So this would be expected to increase profit margin, and thus dividends.  That is unless the increased profits are themselves reinvested... One way or another it is good for the value of the venture.

Do more recent requests for invites have priority over old ones?  I ask because I requested an invite back at the end of September, and haven't heard anything back yet.  Very excited about your company in any case!

Over half this week's dividend was from ASIC sales, and not mining.

Neither of the whole-share pass-throughs charges a management fee.  The 1/100 share pass-through (listed on both bitfunder and btct.co) charges 5%.

I took the plunge and sent my 0.25 and have just now received  a local distributor's order receipt from abitofpi.  With shipping, I would have paid ~0.3 btc to get it direct from the distributor.  I will update when I receive the Raspberry Pi itself.

No, they're not saying that their bitcoins will be worth $40k in total, they're saying the price of one bit coin will be $40k, which would make their supposed 100,000+ hoard worth $4,000,000,000 (four billion).

And I should say, the converse would also be expected to be true.  Lower fiat/BTC makes expenses denominated in fiat more expensive in BTC.
Another consideration is that, higher price of BTC makes shares in ASICminer more expensive in fiat, making entry more difficult for new shareholders.  The 1/100 passthroughs have recently been created to help with this.

Did you happen to ask when the dividend was to be announced?  They're a little overdue - usually comes out by the end of the previous month.
Hold, people, hold.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:42:35
I heard back from James @ Havelock that the delay in dividend announcement was due to optimism that the first BFL ASICs would be arriving during April, and without knowing exactly when, he didn't know what the dividend would be yet (as it is approximately 50% of projected mining revenue).  But I think we'll probably get an announcement soon (or pre-announcement) based on FPGA projected output.

Well, I think with the absolute craziness in BTC/fiat going on right now, many people are holding off buying into a second layer BTC investment.  
Once it restabilizes a little, wherever that is, then people who are still bullish on BTC long-term will start buying more coins(*edit: and some of those will see the buy opportunity in HIM).
We have to remember that the trading volume in HIM over the last three days (151), and the number of units currently listed at prices below the previous all-time trading high of 2.08 (51) are really very small compared to the 4000 units out there.  And the price is now at its lowest since Aug 8, 2012, a week after the second IPO.  There are a lot of units being held by people who are bullish on BTC in the very long term, and because most of them bought in when BTC were a *lot* cheaper than they are now, they don't really stand to benefit much by selling their HIM units right now.
I also notice that a *lot* of the standing asks in the 1.1-1.9 range have been retracted, without being replaced with lower asks.  This suggests to me that those unit-holders have gone long again, probably in reaction to current BTC/fiat uncertainty. I would guess this is the bottom.  I too am stretched out, otherwise I'd buy more.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:49:43
Me too.   Havelock seems very well run, so I will be holding through this nonsense.  Honestly, I think this run is the result of a successful attempt to manipulate the market.  It happened really fast, and almost immediately as the units on the bid side were bought, there was one on the ask side at the same price.  Whoever it was is probably going to buy a bunch more at the bottom and ride it back up.  Sadly, a no fee exchange with relatively low volume incentivizes this sort of behaviour.  You can see there was a large volume run back on the 25th of march.  I suspect the same person.
