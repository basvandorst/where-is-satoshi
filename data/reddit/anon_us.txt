y'all clearly have no idea what you're talking about lol...
Reasons why futures could cause a dip:
1) Institutional investors pull out of their current BTC wallets as  futures are more liquid, established, safe &amp; allow for exotic trading combinations and leverage.
2) Massive shorts signal to the market that large investors do not believe in BTC, causing a chain effect in the actual BTC markets
3) Market manipulation and big players shorting futures (10x leverage) followed by a 10-50k BTC dump in the market..
Probability is fairly low. There's some uncertainty so potentially a dip the day prior to trading. Once market realizes this is unfounded we should see 20k USD/BTC by early next week.

It’s not gay when it’s in a three way. With a honey in the middle there’s some leeway!

whats the probability of a massive dump by hedge funds on monday??
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:26:14
100-250k would be an economic collapse? That's unlikely.

Correct, having worked for ING in their Amsterdam office (Mid Market Investment Banking Division) - I can tell you any intern or recent grad student could publish a report claiming similar things. It in no way represents to overall opinion of the firm.
