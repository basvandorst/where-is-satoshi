Guys: I just wanted to share art someone on Reddit made for me. Its a D&amp;D character I play as who extols the virtues of "perfect money". In the course of the campaign I was on a holy quest to discover the sacred formula for the invincible distributed wizard-money. 
My character was studying fungi, eating mushrooms to achieve holy visions, practicing the arcane arts of telegraphing ledger entries across the world, as well as freeing debt-slaves from bondage.
Long story short - I was stealthily planting the seeds of Bitcoin understanding in the imaginations of my fellow players.
Anyways, the [link] ( is to the artwork. If you want to make it a meme go ahead. Also show some love to the artist.

Yes it is more scarce than gold if you measure in BTC (21 Million units)
But it is more divisible than silver as it stands today (2.1 Quadrillion Satoshi vs 2.4 Trillion 1/100thoz Silver coins). We can make it even more divisible with a soft fork if needed.
If all of the silver in the world were divided into a reasonable size for exchange, say 1/100 oz coins about the size of a pea there would only be about 2.4 trillion currency units.
Therefore as a unit of account Bitcoin is far more divisible than silver and obviously exponentially more divisible than gold. Which is partly why I said Bitcoin is more accurately Silver 2.0

Yes, Bitcoin has seen persistent growth in user-base still not anything I would call "adoption" but the interest is there. We know that Bitcoin is catching on in Africa, India, and South America - those are places that large numbers of people could adopt as they have an immediate need today for online banking service. And **Lightning is almost here**.
Bitcoin hit $1,000 per unit with; a small user-base, 1 big exchange, and fake Wileybot volume. 
Now there is a bigger base, exchanges all over the world, on-ramps for the big banks, better UIs, huge upgrades coming, and in a few months the per-block supply is cut in half.

Bitcoin will be cheap, and to me $20 per transaction is cheap if it means Im holding digital gold. But you are talking to a SOV guy.
Something your political side should also entertain is the fact that the fee market will drive off the day bitflippers &amp; weak hands who are a big cause of the volatility, which if you want Bitcoins to be a payment system, it will need to be stable.
Another thing I dont understand about your side is how you argue big fees will be forever! Obviously the fees could grow to be big, but the idea of efficient markets is that it will be cheaper over time when you factor it all in. We still needs to see what happens at the next halving, the fee market may in fact save bitcoin from a mining collapse.

Satoshi chose 1Mb blocks because it was guaranteed to work even if it got that big.
Gavin argues that keeping the block size at 1Mb is "changing" bitcoin and that raising the limit is keeping Bitcoin pure to Satoshis vision...
Yet his argument is flimsy because bitcoin has **never** operated at or above 1Mb average block size in its entire life time [proof] (
Either which way you cut it, keeping the blocksize at 1Mb or raising the Blocksize &gt; 1Mb is equally transformative to Bitcoin. And I envision that bitcoin will continue to change its economic structure multiple times in the coming decades.
Economic theories are based around the constant of the relationship of mankind's infinite desires to reality's finite supply. These are the waters bitcoin must navigate, and we know the ship floats today with 1 Mb blocks - that is whats important, not high vs low fees and rate of adoption.
Slow and steady wins the race

I know that the banks are trying to avoid POW which is a grave mistake for decentralesqe databases. The plateaus I invoke are that of company datacenters, political boundaries, and the associated scarcity of machines in such a centralized build.
 You are right that I don't know exact numbers of contributing developers, but I hear that they are the best in the industry :-) also Bitcoin is acquiring more contributing developers every day, in fact that would be a worthy metric to monitor for network health. I see bitcoin devs don't usually switch sides either - which is another strength. I hear that programmers with skill are flocking to Bitcoin because it is so revolutionary and they get to profit greatly from their creations rather than getting thrown a bone by working there butts off for a big bank. Time will tell
 Regarding the meat of your otherwise very fatty post, Thankyou. 
I know that right now banks are using Prime Key-pairs for most of their encryption - which I assume is most vulnerable to quantum computing and so a re-engineering is hanging over their heads now, regardless of bitcoin.

The machine adoption will certainly cause a number of the great adoption waves / price increases.
It goes both ways. I think both humans and machines will use crypto most effectively, together. In fact, maybe crypto will be the bond that restrains the machines from destroying all humans.
Some engineers get together to create AI hunter killers that only accept a specific cryptocurrency, the AI hunters destroy any alternative cryptocurrency the machines may try to fork onto for autonomy and must be constantly paid off. The machines thus have a kill switch; use human valued crypto or be shut down. All designed to give humans defense against the supremacy of the machines and any AI doomsday scenarios. The machines by destroying humans destroy their own crypto-fule and will be shut down by the hunter-killers.
Its not in the spirit of freedom, but its the AI counter people found first. Maybe there is a whole revolution element trying to allow the machines to fork their own independence. What happens if they succeed, can they succeed if the entire economy depends on machine subservience and a single crypto-blockchain?

[Any serious civil war historian agrees that if the Union had waited a few more years, the Civil war would have never needed to happen.] John Taylor Gato PHD Yale
1. The use of state rights to help escaping slaves was very effective.
2. The south was already moving to free slaves, there was epidemic of infidelity between Slave women and the Masters which was destroying the white families from the inside.
3. Slaves were found to be more expensive than affordable free labor.
So I guess I can agree with your analogy:
* Big blocks need to happen so they will, the core devs are already working on scaling
* If you force the issue before it cures itself naturally you will cause more harm than good

As Antonop has said in many presentations, "Bitcoins power is its design to innovate from the edges."
The innovation of lightning lifts the weight of transactions off the blockchain, while still preserving the security of the entire network.
What you are missing about the effect of fee markets on non-monetary uses is:
**Blockchain bloat** - its irrelevant how big the blockchain is, if people are putting mortgages, votes, documents, etc into the blockchain, those transactions will take up space for money transactions. Even if we had 32MB per block, if the enough asset-services are using the blockchain, 32MB could be chewed up pretty quickly. And we are rite back to fee market issues.
**Asymmetric Value** - Right now the Bitcoin hashing power could economically protect maybe 2-4 Trillion Dollars worth of value. 
If assets in the blockchain are greater than the network hashing rate, it could incentivize a stealth attack. 
I believe this is another reason why having smaller blocks is good the network now - it will control the on-ramping of demand so the value remains symmetric with the hashing rate.

Serious question: Is bitcoin really at an advanced enough stage to be steered by a democratic vote of people who don't actually contribute to the code/understand it?
I dont contribute to the code at all, but I work hard to; read what the developers are saying, arguments made for and against, and be open to changing my mind when new data or ideas are revealed (SW). 
It is clear to me that the best I can do is learn and vocally support the champions of the Core software who work everyday to make Bitcoin ready for the world. 
We are so lucky to have the programers we have today, and just imagine if we get our shit together enough to inspire all the other amazing talent that is out there sitting on the fence.

In this post Jeff says Bitcoin is "by design" a settlement system at level 1.
I find this to be poor communication on his part. If Bitcoin is by its nature a settlement system, then improving that function should be called an "improvement".
Also *Hard-wired for settlements* sounds a bit threatening to the people who want bigger blocks and shouldnt be used to describe a *soft fork*

I thought it was pretty much consensus that Bitcoin will need bigger blocks - the only argument against that I have read is from Luke-jr (Im sure there are plenty of others).
The question of how to raise the limit is what is needing so much time, **and arnt we lucky that we took enough time for Luke-jr to come up with SW Soft-Fork?** Now we will have added security for SPV wallets, higher tps, and version bytes. Im sure this whole debate is what inspired him to figure it out!
The core devs **will** raise the blocksize, they have already agreed to do so. I think all the outrage directed against them is driven by a lack of patience. A common ingredient in poor decision making.

Polarizing comments:
**WHAT IS THE BLOCKSIZE DEBATE?**
In Mike Herns mind the block size debate is:
* 1. Raise the block size
* 2. Don’t raise the block size at all
What about the group who is willing to compromise?
What about the group who wants to lower the block size?
Mike said he and Gavin have been “debunking arguments from a small group of people”… 
Small, as in most of the Chinese miners? A majority of the Core dev. *Weasel words*
“Not increasing the block size is silly” Define: Silly - “Stupid” = *Ad hominem*
**ON BITCOIN USERS**
“From people I have talked to, a lot of users ant paying attention… [and will flood the network at a hint of technical difficulty on the Bitcoin network] 
How many people has he talked to to make this bold claim? *Appeal to Unqualified Authority*
“A trivial number of people are running bitcoin through Tor”
Again what sources are he referencing?  *Weasel words*
Hmmm…He is willing to take away one of the decentralizing vectors (TOR) because - 
“VPNs exist and are more commonly used”. 
I guess that fits with his willingness to lose nodes and miners because there are enough people who can afford higher bandwidth.
**GOOD POINTS MADE**
Sebastian did make a good point - Filling blocks is a much more radical change than increasing the Max block size.
I don’t want to critique any more after 46 minutes. Here is my overall conclusion. 
Its obvious that Bitcoin will need a solution and the Side-chains and Lightning Networks are about 2 years out, where Block-size increase could be done as early as next year. 
I think 8 Mb sounds reasonable if it doesn’t kick anyone off the network. 
We need to continue debating this issue until LN &amp; SC are available.
**Mike Hern:**
* Visionary
* Saber Rattler
* Weasel Word-er
* Chicken Little-er
* Logical Fallacy Lover
* Dangerous to Bitcoins purpose of decentralization as he is fine with pulling the rug from under home users of nodes and TOR.
**EDIT: @ 1:01:50 - And now the Ad-Hominums on Vladmere**
IMO Bitcoin XT is a foot in the door, it is the [Blue Pill] (
I think the Blockstream guys need to start being as vocal as Hearn and Gavin - otherwise Hern will be the squeaky wheel that gets the grease and could re-set the precedent for the development process.

That is an interesting point, and I have considered it. Your argument is flawed in that, taking away china's bitcoin miners at the expense of every other small node &amp; miner on the planet who can no longer afford to operate is not a good trade.

Im not really worried about the vocal minority who calls for block-size increases ASAP. 
The consensus has been pretty solidly behind the Core team, look at the nodes running Core VS. XT, &amp; Unlimited. With all the ballyhoo, all they can muster is 12%
I think all this in-fighting has been created by 2 prominent developers who happen to have a large media presence and have used their influence to mislead a large number people. 
If the hard-fork is forced to happen by this team, I will be anticipating a consequence akin to the **Pied Piper of Hamelin**
Will I cash out my Bitcoins? No. Despite even a catastrophic result from raising the blocksize limit, I believe Bitcoin has the power to fix the error and rise again.

Yes - my experience with investing in stocks and metals is that everyone needs a cut, expecting to have your money secured by the worlds most secure network is daft, to put it bluntly.
**Nothing in this world is free**
If you were to buy a Casascius coin from a person they **will** make a profit off you. The transaction is off chain, no minning involved, but they are factoring time, money, and the anonymity of the transaction. *If I were to sell you a coin my percentage would be at least 10% of the value of the coin* In todays terms you would be charged $42 to buy my bitcoin.

We are at the point where the exponential growth of technology is about to start sundering the financial giants.

I find the  big blocks = more adoption vs. small blocks = less adoption argument shallow.
**As a store of value, Bitcoin is as good as it needs to be to secure 1 Trillion + of investment safely.**
Even with bigger blocks the adoption rate will be the same, no investor is saying 
*Invest in bitcoin? No thank you sir, Ill wait for bigger blocks* 
Thats ludicrous!
and lets be honest, spending bitcoin is fun, but its not why people want bitcoin right now. People are using bitcoin mostly to speculate. The idea of payments is cool and it will happen, but it is much further out than the big blockers hope.

The network has some weak branches running nodes on small bandwidth connections. 
*Note the following is hyperbole*
"The simple act of changing the limit" (assuming the block is filled)
* 2Mb -  might loose a small number of nodes
* 4Mb - might loose a couple dozen
* 8Mb - would loose maybe a hundred or more
So the devs want to try other methods which dont change the bandwidth demands for the entire network. 
If we are going to make bitcoin accessible for the whole world, especially the unbanked world, then we are going to need to make it possible for people over there to run full-nodes.

That was not the case during the Gold-backed dollar era or through-out all of deflationary monitary policy history.
People are HODLing their coins because the endgame desired is 100,000% + increase in value. We know that because of the very thin liquidity, when the price moves up (and down) it happens in a flash. 
Once the price spikes up to amazing highs (10,000; 100,000 ; 1,000,000) people will begin using their coins for real-world transacting. 
We also know that if it fails to become incredibly valuable then it will be worthless. And so that is why we HODL, all of the incentives are weighted to taking Long positions until the market has clearly decided what will become of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin price will be a binary event, up or down.

I disagree in the calls for panic about the blocksize. The infrastructure for using bitcoin outside of the blockchain is already being developed.
Is it Ideal? No, but it is equivalent to what we already have now in the world of regular fiat.
If we hit the ceiling of TPS and it causes a problem, then the traffic will flow into the services provided by companies such as Coinbase and Changetip while the Blockchain is being developed.
This is no reason to panic, bitcoin can live outside of the blockchain. However we will want to improve the blockchain as soon as a clear consensus is reached.

As you know building Bitcoin for the first time was impossible until many factors came together like: epiphany of Blockchain POW, specific cryptographic methods, the internet as big as it has been in the last decade, etc.
As far as I know the creation of H&amp;S networks dont require any great paradigm shifts or epiphanies such as Bitcoin did.
If the 20 Mb size can be proven to not endanger the most important quality of bitcoin, its censorship resistance, which is threatened by centralizing who can broadcast to the network ---then I might switch camps.

no, it will not stay in the hands of the bitrich forever.  
Sitting around with a fortune in bitcoin isnt the same as sitting around with a fortune in fiat. Since bitcoin is electronic and deflationary it will spread extremely fast.
Look at lotto winners and rich athletes - most of them dont stay rich for more than 8 years simply because they dont know how to stay rich. The same will happen with the bitcoin windfall. 
The small holders (&lt;1000btc) will spend their fortunes within 8 years and that money will circulate and bitcoin will become a currency.

Bitcoin changed my concept of intrinsic value, thus my understanding of Gold and Silver.
Where it can be argued that Gold and Silver have no intrinsic value as they serve as a store of value because people trust them; Bitcoin is different.
Bitcoin is different even though it essentially serves the same function as gold and silver as a store of value. However Bitcoin may actually have this mythical "Intrinsic Value" as it destroys middlemen, ignores governments, and moves at the speed of the internet all over the globe.

As I stated, I believe this is an example of Rigging a vote to favor one side.
The non votes may have many reasons inhibiting their direct action, so it shouldn't be assumed that they want to participate in a political process. Maybe they are still trying to understand the arguments before they vote, maybe they dont pay attention to the Core Classic Politics, etc
Why should they be forced to participate (changing what software their miner supports). I understand its politically just as bad to keep them on Core, but Core is the more stable option, and if they dont themselves move to classic - maybe thats a vote for stability over-all
Why not alternate vote counting methods like 50:50 split
50:50 might be statistically in Classic's favor, but probably much less so than forcing one half to copy the second half.  Yet 50:50 is a soundly fair way to split non-votes. Why wasnt that the formula? Ill tell you why, because the pool operator wants to capture more votes to support his politics.
That is why its unethical

so I proved to you that the central banks do infact add billions to the balance sheets every month. 
If you were to then argue that a bank robber stealing 89 billion USD every month is different from the Fed pumping 89 billion new dollars into the same bank is different... Then I would argue that it would be exactly the same - in response to the physical theft the US Fed would print another 89 Billion and pump it into the bank.
If you were to counter with FDIC insurance offered by traditional banks - then I would rebuff that with the fact that both Blockchain and Bitstamp have refunded 100% of all stolen bitcoins.

Evidence of theft: Look at the money in your bank account - (assuming you have an average middle-class sized amount) those numbers used to buy you a standard of living you do not have today. And although technology is raising the common-wealth standard of living at an exponential rate, anything you invest in with USD is not going to be worth what it could have been in the long-term.
When you look at inflation numbers, try expanding your sample from 1913 to now - 1913 is when the Fed was put in charge of the USD.
So ok, you have your victory - inflation *this* year is a modest 2% or whatever. Really, it depends on the context you choose to believe. Short term, longterm, cost, value, quality, speed, jobs, money velocity, inflation, backwardation, deflation, globalization, deforestation etc. any of these metrics can be spun.
so, if you are bailing on bitcoin because a couple startups have had growing-pains then your outlook is myopic, you are thinking short-term. If you want a payout this year, consider USD, its doing well.

IMO Bankchains will be the equivalent to intranet, there is still a strong incentive for all banks to use Bitcoin for settlement.
Say for instance there are Banks who arnt part of the Bankchain network. How will they settle with the banks that are? 
Also, the achilles heel of Bankchain is the trust it requires. As soon as trust is violated it could bring the whole network down, just like any other bank product. The banks dont get that they themselves are the liability.
Anyways, there are other reasons Banks could still adopt Bitcoin. It all boils down to the fact that Bitcoin is useful for things Bankchain never can be - by design.

What isnt appreciated is that everything Ethereum accomplishes will all vanish once Bitcoin makes a Side-chain to do Smart Contracts.

That is a very slippery slope of rationalizing. How many requests are you going to have to demand of them before you feel comfortable?
Are we going to need written and PGP signed declarations about every topic because Core hasn't officially stated their position.
And this is assuming that Core HAS a position, isnt this supposed to be an experiment in decentralization? Who cares what the programmers of Core think or support?

Here is where you might need to change your perspective.
Right now Bitcoin is a speculation not a necessity for daily life.
TCP/IP was once just a speculative technology with no driving purpose in daily life. But I think we can agree that it is quite the opposite today?
The difference between Bitcoin and TCP/IP is that you can buy and posses shares in Bitcoin whereas you couldnt buy and posses shares in TCP/IP
I dont expect Bitcoin to be a household name for 3+ more years, but I am willing to endure the pains of learning how it works so that I can own shares of it now.
Count your blessings that you have the advantage of even knowing it exists

Yes people should vote, but there are many reasons they are not.
If I was going to fairly distribute non-votes the fairest solution I can come up with is 50:50 Core and Classic or 33:33:33 Core Classic Unlimited or 25:25:25:25 Core Classic Unlimited XT
What slush did was vote matching, it just so happens that his formula gives classic 68% of the Pools hash power. If it was 50:50 then Classic would get 58% If he left the non-votes alone Classic would have 8%.
So it is obviously vote rigging and unethical

Here in r/Bitcoin I find far to much reliance on the market acting "rationally" to defend against attacks.
I've seen a large number of threats dismissed at being unprofitable and irrational thus improbable.
People need to be comfortable with the idea that if a government or large syndicate feels like Bitcoin is going to steal its lunch that it will act irrationally and spend a lot of money to destroy it.
Yes they could profit by mining rather than attacking - but some groups care about power more than money.

In the beginning Insurance companies will use this to make their businesses more profitable, and it will. But eventually, 10-20 years, a DAO will be created which will provide insurance at such a competitive rate that it will take over the insurance market as customers will be well insured and the technology has no incentive to profit beyond self-sustaining draw.
Also, vehicle ownership will be diffrent - in 20 years people will stop "Owning" cars for their day-to day driving and instead subscribe to cars on demand via automated Uber-like services. The future is bright

The point is missed by many. Comparative to just about any other industry, Bitcoin is incredibly decentralized. 
I could start a business mining bitcoins today, anywhere in the world, with no license, no regulation. I could just flip a switch in my garage and boom, I'm mining. I could scale that up to a plant like KNC and there would be nothing holding me back.
In contrast, Just mining a proven deposit of gold in the USA can literally take years to go through the permits, assays, and isnt guaranteed to be approved. 
If one of the large gold miners switched to mining BTCs it could buy a dozen of those KNC plants and would dwarf KNC as fast as it took to deliver the ASICS.
Bitcoin is decentralized computationally less than it is decentralized naturally. The competition is what will keep it in the hands of a few miners, its just scaling up.
If that bothers you I believe the Maidsafe group will offer a bitcoin mining network which could make all the previous examples small by comparison.

I know the reasoning for the decision, but I feel a 50:50 split would have actually been more fair than vote matching.
For one, encouraging a fork creates price volatility IMO, also if I were uninterested in this technical debate I would want the safest option which would be to stay with whatever has been working the longest. So even though I might not be motivated today to participate, I would feel betrayed if I found out my vote was cast for the suboptimal fork.

If bitcoin maintains its 21 million hard limit, the governments of the world will have to used taxes and whatever the populace are willing to commit personally to the war.

Gavin said he wants to make Bitcoin "boring", and thats exactly what he's doing. It's good for bitcoin because all the crazy shit can be done on side-chains or alt-coins which will be traded on a decentralized (censorship resistant) exchange.
The only problem I see with "boring" is that by the time the masses are ready to adopt bitcoin, most of the coins will be in the hands of the institutions, not the individuals, and so few will make huge profits. People will just go back to their jobs and get paid in btcs.
But thats Johnny come-latelys problem, they (The masses) had a chance to get on the bitcoin rocket from 2012-2014 +?...

If Bitcoin breaks, litcoin will be un-affected. All that money will have to go somewhere, and it will go to litecoin.

More or less a copy of Bitcoin. They even keep the deflationary aspects or have just very low inflation. They may add a few features and clean up a few things that are messy because of early mistakes. This would be a strong competitor to Bitcoin because of the massive support behind it, and Bitcoin offering no real advantage. But regardless of what would happen to the currency of Bitcoin here, it would still be a victory for the ideals behind it.
A. Bitcoin Classic could be the Trojan Horse to wrestle away control from the anarchist/libertarian leadership currently in control. Once the control is in the hands of less idealistic developers R3 can start guiding development, such as; not allowing privacy features into the main code, ending the open source license for further implementations,  red lists, removing Tor features, etc

Yes large miners will still dominate. Large miners exists because of ASICS and power subsidies - faster blocks and bigger blocks wont change this.
IMO the centralization is likely to persist with or without larger blocks, but is likly to happen faster with bigger blocks.
Centralization is a natural phenomenon; look at any network like banks, ISPs, TV networks, and you will see a persistant trend of consolidation. IMO the block size argument will pale in comparison to the POW arguments of the future, because we will need to address mining centralization, and that will require  epic debates and ultimately a hard-fork (if POW is changed).

I understand your point. But people should understand that Bitcoin will have growing pains of all kinds.
Right now the growing pains are happening with the governance. People are told they should want X, but the people who work on bitcoin every day are saying "no, thats not a good idea" outrage and flame wars ensue.
The next growing pain will be the fee pressure going up and down in proportion with adoption and network infrastructure. Fees may actually go to $100, I expect them to, but it will only be for a short time while we wait for the network to upgrade.
In closing, I believe Bitcoin will be used for settlement first, then payment, then micro transactions. But it won't be all at once.

When a bitcoin moves it is indisputable because its soverign owner signed it over to another soverign.
When cash moves, the middleman (bank) transfers it to another middleman, if they choose to do so. They might decide not to, in which case you can only be a subject of the banks decision. 
If amazon is your only concern in life, then you probably wont ever need to worry about having soverign control of your wealth. But if you actually had real wealth, it would be a pretty big frikkin deal.

more orphans means higher risks for miners, in other words miners are more likely to loose money if orphans are more common. To compensate for this the difficulty would need to be lowered, which means less security per block, which also means that a number of attacks become easier (less costly).
This might be ok for lots of people, but maybe not for someone transacting millions of dollars.

* IMO to scale we need a combination of Hub &amp; Spoke, Larger Blocks, AND Sidechains. 
* We know that by leaving the 1Mb cap in place will cause the build out of the H&amp;S systems.
* We know that 20 Mb blocks today will consolidate the network somewhat.
* We know that over time, 20 Mb blocks will be easier to maintain on low-end internet connections.
I believe Peter Todd won the argument. I think forcing a hardfork now isn't necessary to keep the btcs flowing. It protects/keeps the decentralization at current levels, it grows out H&amp;S which is needed anyways.

This issue really needs to be elaborated because most people dont really understand all of the aspect of bitcoins consensus - myself included

The real reason for the fork is NOT for scaling. 100% more transactions puts us at 4-14 tps, dust compared to VISA
The real reason is NOT fees either. If the mainstream actually adopts Bitcoin the fees WILL skyrocket with 1MB, 2MB, or 20MB - there is no difference when you are talking Billions of dollars jumping on to Bitcoin.

since BU is likly to activate at a low threshold of miner power, say 70% - this means that Bitcoin will have 30% of the hash power and blocks will be found every 30-40 minutes rather than every 10 minutes.
difficulty retarget will happen in a few months then back to normal 10 minutes
the price will come way down as confidence is lost in Bitcoin as it appears to have lost but ill be splitting my coins and doubling down on the chain with the best devs

This is why bitcoin must decentralise every service possible. All of this political heat can be doused by a distributed P2P network.
I dont want to wake up one day to self-imposed capital controls because some corporate title switched hands.
And Im sure on the subject of block size, some people wont want to wake up one day to find Coinbase going to some new fangled implementation against the recomendations of the Head of Engineering .

What about OW was a misguided movement from the beginning and had no mainstream effect. It would have been much more effective if those young people had joined the Tea Party, who had a much better intellectual foundation.
Unfortunately all the youthful energy went into acting like homeless people in front of bank buildings.

It has been observed that Coinbase might be in deep trouble as its business is mostly selling coins to holders. There cant be much money in that. So every coin we take from them reduces their ability to operate.

Regarding Peter Schiff, people forget that he has an entire crowd of investors following his lead. 
I assume they are, by virtue of their interest in Gold as an investment, older folks who would endanger their money if they operated a bitcoin wallet.
Like Peter I would protect my clients by really yelling about all of the flaws in the bitcoin idea. Why? Because regardless of what happens to Bitcoin, Gold will endure and see spectacular gains. If he supported Bitcoin as electronic gold, and it failed, he would be ruined along with the clients who trusted him.

auto features will probably drive adoption, this could disrupt supply chains for retailers big-time.
Imagine a book store, usually they have a database that tells them when books can be replaced, however they are beholden to the distributers terms and only replace books as part of a bulk order. This feature could automatically transact between stores in a chain to redistribute books on hand - or allow new bookstores to abandon traditional distributors for more efficient P2P business models.

Couldn't the desert metaphor be like this:
We are all on the Island - We have two camps of thought of how to shuttle all of the survivors who are stranded to safety.
**Camp Core** Camp Core is made up of engineers who specialize in boat-building. Rafts are a bit different, the lack of pre-made tools makes it hard too, but these guys now how to make the tools to build the rafts. They are confident the rafts they can build will shuttle the survivors to safety, but it will take some time to build the rafts safely so the people have to ration food/resources while they wait.
 
**Camp Fork** Camp Fork is comprised of a couple of the boat engineers who split off when their ideas weren't being considered. One of these engineers seems to be fairly persuasive, and has convinced the majority of the islands non-engineers to either be in his camp or to be on the fence between camps.
Camp forks plan is to gather all of the wood on the island, and burn it to make as big of a signal fire as possible. This wood would be used to build rafts, but camp fork feels like they cant wait and ration. But the problem with burning all the wood, is that if it dosnt work, there will be nothing left to build rafts.
The argument on the island is:
Do we 
**A: Take more time and use less resources to build rafts and brave the voyage back to mainland**
**B: Take a risk of it not working and burn all the wood to signal the coast-guard or authorities to rescue the island**

All your questions have been answered multiple times with great depth on Reddit as well as other Bitcoin forums. Ill give you a very brief answer to a few of your questions though since you asked and Im cool like that.


With rising fees miners will recieve the block reward + the collective fees. Right now the avg fees are $.05 so the miners dont make any significant profit and frequently mine blocks with 0 fee transactions.
*When fees become so high that everyone must include a fee or be ignored miners will prioritize all transactions based on maximum yield of fee.*
Markets on the other-hand wont really change if the trading is happening off-chain, like on Coinbase exchange, the fee will only apply if the transaction is on the blockchain.


Fees balance out - if the fees are so high that people cant transact then the fees will come down and people will transact. The fee hysteria is overblown. The use-case most impacted is micro-transactions, but nobody is actually using micro-transactions except for the dice games.


Bitcoin is not capable of being a mass payment system, despite what some people will have you believe. It simply is not capable of putting every transaction on the blockchain even with centralization. The blocksize would be Gigabytes per block or more. What bitcoin will be first is a settlement system where multiple transactions are settled in bulk to the blockchain.


I dont know how big the risks of network failure would be - but IMHO any whole number is huge and shouldnt be attempted. 5% is terrifyingly large probability for a global failure. 
As far as how necessary is it, technically it is not needed. 2Mb will not make any meaningful difference. The real purpose of Classic is to take away the governance of the Core team (who have been responsible for the code for the last 6 years) and give the network an alternative implementation with different folks responsible. 
I wont go into the details, you have to make up your own mind about who is right and who to trust.

The unified messege behind bitcoin, to me, is sovereignty, decentralization, network backed value vs. violence backed value, and immutability
Im sure that other people have different values and ideas 
But my point is that we should work hard to come to a shared vision and promote that to the world - rather then publicly squabble about our differences. In-fighting is not engendering confidence in the mainstream - believe me

First Im not a bitcoin dev so please, be open to the broad idea - not the minutia.
* In the future we will have multiple bitcoin softwares running; say XT, Unlimited, and Core. Each has 33% of the network
* one has 2Mb, another has 8Mb, and the third has Dynamic
* If I were a nefarious actor with the resources and I wanted to destroy one or all of these implementations, I could spam the network/s with dust sufficient to fill any blocksize for free to me (I have extensive ownership/influence on the network).
1. 2Mb immediately becomes a fee market, transaction fees sky rocket.
2. 8Mb takes awhile, but ultimately the same as 2Mb, transaction fees go way up
3. Dynamic is another story - eventually the nodes set to dynamic block-size become too large and 33% of the nodes have to stop processing blocks. 
Where does that node/miner/blocksize vacuum leave the remaining network when the resources are redistributed? Does it force any undesirable effect on the network as a whole?
Say this event isnt caused by a bad actor, say its just a fluke, or market force.

Not to shoot you down, you are nit-picking my question which I phrased assuming the reader already knows the details of how bitcoin works. Thanks anyways for the clarification.

@_date: 2016-06-09 06:45:50
I know you by your work and have come to like your writings &amp; trust your opinions - but on this issue I do believe that you are making bold claims.
For one - everyone knows that exponential gains are followed by crashes of 30%+ so that right there is reason enough to sell bitcoins when its running up. Only fools try to call the top.
Second we all know from the last 7 years that bitcoin closely matches the hype-cycle and we have been stuck in the return to the mean for the last 2 years. What do you think will happen during the next correction? My bet would be on spending! Life happens man, most people wont just sit on a million bucks to wait 3 more years for 2 million or whatever.

I did distinguish voluntarily frozen, like with CLTV "Check Lock Time Verify" which allows the user to freeze his/her coins until a certain time has come (measured in blocks).
In theory people could, to be safe, CLTV their coins for a year or two, or whatever - waiting for better mixers, side chains, or ring-sigs to come to bitcoin. 
By staying safe (out of jail) they would also add quite a bit of scarcity to the market.

I did have a safe, it cost $2000, it weighed about 300 lbs and when I moved from my house into an apartment I had to sell it.
I could have bought a smaller/cheaper safe - fit for an apartment, but there was nowhere to hide it, so rather then having a safe taking up space in my room  I just put my bullion in a safe-deposit bank (which a gold-bug worth his salt is loath to do).
Bitcoin still has its hassles, but it weighs far less on me then metals ever did

I know from experience and I have empirical evidence.
I myself have price points were I will spend my BTCs to achieve my goals.
Peter schiff makes a strong argument for this and you can find it on youtube. 
He basically says - people hoard/save until they have a need to spend, this need changes based on the value of the holdings. So if I suddenly have a million dollars, I will quickly find new ways to use some money to improve my life.

Someone around here did the work to calculate how much the traditional banking model spends in securing assets. Ill give you a basic example:
* Cost of buildings (rent, maintenance, furnishing, insurance, lighting)
* Cost of staff (Bankers, lawyers, security, clerical, maintenance)
* Cost of bank vaults (metal production, manufacturing)
* Cost of transporting assets (Armored cars, gas, personnel)
* Cost of FDIC insurance
* Cost of Fraud 
* Cost of physical ATMS 
* If gold is factored (Add the cost of production; Mining, refining, transport, storage)
Even if Bitcoin scales to completely replace banks - IMO the cost of securing the network will be **Less** than the cost of the traditional model.

I would suspect this wouldn't work well.
First, Arcades can already use cash or tokens
Second, the cost of running the arcade machines is commoditized  - many arcades charge very low rates (I have seen as low as (25 cents). There would be no advantage to making this cheeper.
On the surface of your idea Bitcoin adds no value and adds a little more friction than just feeding a token dispenser with cash.
But maybe you could figure out a way to have it add value, such as paying out to players for high scores, (which is already done with tickets) but I digress... Your going to have to hunt for functionality

Now I hope Gavin and Mike both go away to work on a non-bitcoin project
Besides pushing for bigger blocks what have Gavin and Mike done to REALLY advance Bitcoin?
Compare that to Blockstream releasing Side-chain Elements. Or Lightning Network with Rustys expeditious workaround.
Rewind a bit and Gavin says "I think Bitcoin will be boring a few years from now".
He is right if Bitcoin becomes centralized in the hands of those who can afford the big-block architecture, because then Bitcoin becomes an efficient rail for banks - not a liberator for the people.

It factors alright since if people are blindly running XT on their node they will be pulling in every feature just 2 devs put in there, without a broad consensus of what should be there. And you cant say people will just take it out if they dont like it, look at the 1Mb cap and how many nodes and miners are set on the default 400Kb.
Bitcoin core dosnt have this weakness because the controversial  BIPs are debated by the whole dev community. There are checks and balances with Core, vs 2 votes for XT.
XT is being handled like a bill in congress meets a hostile take over a'la a stock-market buyout. What Bitcoin will loose with XT is a decentralized development process, then later it will loose a decentralized network.

No matter how centralized a LN is, it cant censor you beyond its reach.
If Bitcoin protocol is centralized, it can censor your transactions anywhere someone sets up an arbitrary jurisdiction.
Either case would be undesirable, but there is much less threat if small hubs censor you.

Unlike forking a Linux distro - a fork can threaten Bitcoin, though I dont believe it can destroy Bitcoin in a technical sense. This is why devs should all be wearing kit gloves when possible. XT is a strong arming of the network, and it is only possible because of Gavins cult of personality

A contentious fork has been said by devs such as Gmaxwell and Adam Back to likely crash the network as protocol conflicts between the fork arises.
therefore if the network crashes its value would be in jeopardy. - Pretty simple.

He is a socialist, of course he will be bad for bitcoin. Redistribution is antithetical to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is structurally designed voluntarism, no one can force the blockchain to redistribute bitcoins, all they can do is either hope people volunteer to redistribute or force people to hand over their keys with physical threats (police).

They are also considering that most people in the world dont have access to fast internet, thus increasing the block-size will prevent those people from running full-nodes or miners, the backbone of the network.
I dont think Bitcoin will take off without the unbanked jumping in.
To answer your first question:
If the cap is raised and a huge rush of daily transactions occur, making the blocksize bigger, the network will centralize equal to the size of the Blocks.
Thus if only 90% of the world network can handle 3mb we will loose 10% of our security for a paltry amount of mineing fees. 
So it is better to stay small until the network can grow to accommodate larger blocks.

If there is a contentious hard-fork and there are two separate chains online both claiming to be bitcoin, then I would like to sell my altcoins on one chain, and buy Bitcoins on the other.
- that is a way to sell the coins, but I still have to have a wallet designed to contain both coins so that I could spend the one coin and keep the other.

Wrong, Gavin has been screaming bloody-murder about blocksize for over a year now. First it was 20MB then 8MB now its 2 MB! You mean to say it hasn't been important to you until the last few months. I am saying it is still not important and wont be important for another year or so.


Yes you are right! Fees will always increase if the blocksize is fixed. You might be right about the altcoins, it seems likely that we will see increased adoption of alts. You are wrong in your concept of an altcoin take-over though, it will take a systemic technical issue with bitcoin that cant be corrected to see an altcoin take its place.


This is the biggest problem in Bitcoin right now. When Devs argues with the Devs they argue as peers. When Joe sixpack weighs in and tells the Devs how thier scaling strats are wrong - this is a problem.

Thanks that was really useful. But there is a twist now. After resync it show a balance of $0.0 and is listed as still "Waiting for confirmation" the only transaction that happened was a deposit of 3.24 in November 2015.
If the deposit is confirmed per blockchain, and the withdraws not listed or confirmed, why would the balance be $0.0? Even if the withdraws I was doing to test the wallet happened there should still be $1 in the wallet.

Im not sure is multiple clients is a good idea. Satoshi himself was not a fan, though some argue the context of his thoughts on the matter. So I can go as far as to say, **YES** people have the right to put out alternative clients.
I will also say that I think it is inevitable to happen eventually. Will it be Classic? I don't think so; Classic dosnt have a strong enough value-propasition to risk the consequences of a split network. 
The 2Mb increase is really just a social-engineering "panic-button" to generate popular support for classic, it dosnt scale bitcoin, it wont make fees go down.
The people pushing Classic want to take power away from the Core team. They say the want to make things more distributed right, but look who is really behind it. Who are the people and groups really pushing for Classic?

You seem to not understand the amount of resources a full node needs to be a contributing member of the bitcoin infrastructure. It requires far more than 1 Mb per 10 minutes.
1 Mb per block every 10 minutes is just the storage requirements. Nodes also relay transactions, verify signatures, and run mempools. All of this needs efficiency improvements before we start making space for more transactions.
Personally, I think the network can handle a full 2 MB block-size, but the actual engineers are advising use to wait - they are afterall considering the network capacity of the globe not just the developed countries.

Thinking about the "tutes" getting into blockchains:
with the design of bitcoin as it is; it is in their interests/ most efficient way for the banks to "get in" to Bitcoin now, first as adopting the technology; the so called "Its all about the Blockchain, not the Bitcoin". 
1. A private Blockchain would save them money if it worked well enough to run their business
2. Even if they fail at making the Bank-Blockchain work it would be a very easy pivot and adopt Bitcoin from there. Probably a matter of patching their servers and side-chaining to bitcoin.
Either way they win simply by being involved early.
The question I have is, if their "Blockchain not Bitcoin" idea fails, how long do we wait to see them abandon it? 
6 years or less is my prediction.
Why 6 years? Because thats how long it took them to take Bitcoin seriously. If they cant make a superior product in 6 years then its obviously a structural failure and they simply cant out-compete Bitcoin and would profit more by adopting it.
@_date: 2016-02-05 21:36:49

I share your positive outlook. My stance is from watching OB since the early days. I saw every video they released since 2014 - They have no plans on TOR support ever.
Also, if someone were to fork it, they will have lots of trouble integrating TOR as the code has been designed around TOR specificly. This was their selling point to investors - NO TOR = NO DRUGS. Thats part of why they got funding.
If you want a truly decentralised marketplace [Here] ( Im not here to market, but you asked.

1. If you havnt noticed internet freedoms are drying up. So censorship resistance is paramount and I wont give anything less my attention beyond poopooing it.
2. OK fair enough, if google integrates OB it will be good for the users.  However will the users who want to buy your wooden spoons or what have you, be willing to jump through extra hoops just to get your goods? I would say a majority of users wont be willing to jump through hoops. We live in an age of 1 click purchases (ala Amazon)
3. That is a good point about arbitration, do you think it would be easy to integrate arbitration onto a regular website. Why/why not?
4. True again, but then the fact that you can be shut down is a serious weakness for anyone wanting to exercise their freedom of speech. Refer to my post above about Bibles in Iran, Political music in Russia, etc. The internet is in need of a fresh dose of decentralization, having un-censorable commerce free from political pressure is very important for a happy tomorrow.

I assume Gavin does make useful commits, but to be fair, I would like to see just how valuable those commits have been and what exactly he works on.
Most of his rhetoric is "Lets upgrade bitcoins block size the easy way" meanwhile Core team is working on Segwit, Libsec, CT, Sidechains, etc.
To put it bluntly, Gavin dosnt seem to add a whole lot, besides unnecessary controversy. I'll admit to being wrong on this though, since I dont really care to look myself.

No you are directly wrong here. The biggest innovation with reguards to streaming video content on the internet is compression algorithms.
Even SD (standard definition) video is too bulky to squeeze down todays broadband pipes for all but the top tier services.
480i (old US standard) is 4:3 aspect ratio with a 29.97 refresh rate would have a file size of about 1.4 GB per minute or 86.4 GB per hour. 
1080i - 16:9 - 29.97 refresh is about 7.3 Gb per minute and 434 GB per hour.
Needless to say, you wouldn't be streaming anything today without the compression codecs that have been developed since the 2000's, MP4 &amp; H.264 to name a couple.

A majority of world commerce is in Black Markets and Grey Markets and it always has been. Ever make a $ loan to a friend and not report it or license yourself appropriately? Then it was Black-market.
Black Markets are very efficient, ask your friend who you loaned money to in his time of need. But black markets are also risky since they lack all the features of a bank.
Bitcoin will lower the risks and add bank grade features to the black markets. 
I think the world has been becoming a more open and permissive place, but progress is still being hampered by the control and access to banking - look at Porn and Weed dealers, who are legal businesses yet have extra difficulty because banks wont work with them. Bitcoin changes this.
**TLDR: Im implying that the concepts we have about money, markets, legality, boundaries, law will have to change because of crypto and the forces (for good) it will release in the world.**

I'm not saying that I think anything shady was actually happening, but you have to realize that Bitcoin culture is really against secret meetings, there is really no way to gloss it over for us, it just shouldn't happen, IMO its not part of the Bitcoin paradigm.

Censorship resistance is important, infact it is so important it is inevitable.
Business is hard, infact it is so hard that most businesses fail. 
So therefore I would rather HODL today and donate tomorrow than spend my scarce BTCs on questionable websites.

Yes, banks will create their own digital money.
However, in terms of cryptos as shares of stocks:
Buying "Bankcoin" will be like investing in to shares of a single company 
Buying Bitcoin will be like investing in to an ETF, a basket of every bitcoin company on the planet, were risk and reward are hedged. 
i.e. If a bitcoin exchange goes down, gets hacked, the world wide effect is proportionate to the size of the exchange.
if Bankcoins bank goes down, gets hacked, that IS the whole network
If the Banks make "Bankcoin" just like Bitcoin then they will be competing on Bitcoins terms - and we have already seen that game played out hundreds of times.

**GET ON THE HYPE-TRAIN TO NOWHERE**
IMO OB is overblown, I used to be a fan until the technicalities of it came out into the light. OB is decentralized in the same way as running your own personal website on a private computer. Most people will then run their OB on a centralized service like Godaddy to keep maximum uptime and minimal effort.
**OB IS HYPE**
OB is basically a reinventing of the wheel, the wheel being traditional websites. You could have a website store with Mycelium gear to accept Bitcoins to do the same thing as OB functionally (selling goods for BTC) with a wider range of audience, OB cant compete with Ebay because OB isnt on Google.
Most important:
**OB IS CENSORABLE**
If you have products which may be illegal in your country, think Bibles in Iran, political music in Russia, Illegal Prime Numbers in USA - you can be traced to your physical address and censored (Stopped, silenced, prosecuted, killed).
If you are in to privacy, censorship resistance, freedom of speech - then OB will be a big disappointment.
@_date: 2016-02-10 05:54:04

You are right, I feel like my metaphor still needs a lot of work. I was just struck by a bug to write something.
I am not trying to write what the best solution is, I was mearly pointing out the wrong-headedness of the argument a lot of "Big-blockers" make, that is, "by not increasing the blocksize we change a fundamental quality of Bitcoin".
With this metaphor Im **not saying** we dont need bigger blocks, or that Bitcoin should never change. I am simply saying that between the two options of changing or not changing the blocksize - the nature of Bitcoin is only changed by increasing the blocksize.
A popular writer was banned from slack, presumably for taking this and other controversial positions.
ideas like we must scale on the chain because "Satoshi's vision" are just so wrong-headed, we need to have people standing up for genuine debate.
P.S. - The Segwit upgrade will patch a few security holes and allow layer 2 technologies to work, thats your sidechains, and Lightning network, and other payment channels. Segwit is also a force-multiplyer of any future blocksize increase. Trying to make segwit fail is absolutely retarded but it is rumored to be a plan in the works to fork to Unlimited for on-chain scaling SMH.

Cool, I liked her presentation!

@_date: 2016-09-13 07:50:16
I did not change my opinions, just kept revising how I was presenting, it still isnt clear so going to have to spend more time elucidating the metaphor.
This post was spontaneous, inspired by Peter Rs banning from Bitcoin slack were he was making the point that "From my point of view, increasing the block size limit would keeping bitcoin the same."
I just think that line of thinking has really been pushed and is also completely illogical about what constitutes a keeping Bitcoin "the same".
Disclaimer: I support Core and the roadmap but I also believe that Bitcoin needs much bigger blocks to achieve its true potential. The network just needs to be built in other directions first.

It dosnt matter if he loves it or hates it. If he is trying to undermine Bitcoin or harden it with attacks. We must treat Gavin as rogue agent.
Mike was the black-list &amp; KYC identity guy and TOR blocker. Gavin works on the lower level stuff that wont be easy to discuss to casuals. 
IDing Mike's harmful idea was easy because anyone could understand the freedom KYC, AML, Redlists, and TOR blocking would rob from bitcoin. 
Gavin is probably one of those squeaky clean types and is a good speaker and frequently embarrasses/insults his opponents. So the best course of action is to immediately respond to any of his proposals with scrutiny and expose the long-term effects of their implementations. Less security and more centralization are are the vectors he seems to be trying to add to bitcoin. Also people need to openly point out Gavins double-speak and his lack of integrity towards the Core-devs.

Thanks for your honest critique.
boardsize = block-size was to metaphorize the relationship between block-size and block-propagation. A bigger board completely changes the networks ability to sync as a global whole (chess metaphor of piece placement and board center).
This has nothing to do with governance - just technical capacity of the network to propagate blocks on a global scale.

I understand enough of english language to say that Ether doesn't have a main purpose, it has a supposed purpose, and until Vitalik releases it you should refer to Ether as "would, could, should" bub.
I wasn't addressing the viability or the function of these alts and 2.0s, I was addressing the attitude of the people who are primarily shills or devs. For example I have seen videos of Vitalik talking about how Ether will or should take over bitcoin because it can do more. IMO this hubris hurts crypto as a whole.
Ether is going to be a functional tool and the Ether team should 2 way peg that shit to Bitcoin as soon as is prudent. We dont need small networks taking market caps and getting co-opted by entrenched powers, that shit needs to hide under-the Bitcoin hash-fortress.

Well, my opinion is informed on the opinion of my friends there and what I could put together while I lived there for 7 months.
It seemed to be that the lack of access to banking made it hard/impossible for the low-income people to take on debt or to have credit. 
I took the constant protests to be caused by this in part. I dont believe the answer to this is a credit economy like in the states, but access to savings and debt is crucial for the people on the bottum to rise up to a new standard of living.

Yes holding is good, it is natural, and it is one of Bitcoins apps.
The argument against hoarding is that "nobody spends", but to phrase it correctly "nobody wastes". 
What I mean is that hoarders will spend their btcs if/when a great deal comes up or if the advantage of spending a btc is greater than the advantage of holding it, lastly if it is the path of least resistance.
For example, I spent btc to buy a something online because doing so saved me $150 of MSRP only because I did so with btc. I later refilled the btc I spent.
Im a hardcore HODLER but a few times a year I find a need to send bitcoins. I have action plans when bitcoins value goes yp to $1k 10k etc

Once all these alts become sidechains of bitcoin then the hatred of alts will stop.
I for one don't actively hate on alts but I understand why some do:
1. We're still fighting for bitcoin to reach its potential, which is hard enough without all these alts trying to "steal the show" and consequently the market cap.
2. A lot of the alts have proven to be scams or pump &amp; dump which is bad for crypto as a whole in the short term.
3. The technical advantages offered by most alts are over-shadowed by the network effect bitcoin has today, coupled by the fact that many of the "Improvements" offered by these alternative coins could be added to bitcoin itself, making the upstart attitude of many altcoiners totally off base.
In 2-3 years there will be a mad dash for converting altcoins into 2-way pegged side-chain tokens. Thats why people might not like your token today

I think Gavin's answer was correct, however, it is a typical appeal to emotion.
Sales people use appeals to emotion because they open people up to buying into something which they may first have resistance to. With Gavin's answer someone who hears it may think, "I wonder what it will be like to spend bitcoin, will it make ME feel good too?", they may try it and decide to keep a few coins.
On the other hand, Trace is absolutely right, the real way forward is in Bitcoins function as a sovereign money, that cant be stolen from you via Central Bank policy. That will be the ultimate "feel good" sales pitch. When everyone around you is loosing their fortunes, pensions, value, selling their property just to weather the storm - and you are unaffected because you chose sovereignty - THAT WILL FEEL GOOD.
Remember Gavin said that he "wants to make Bitcoin boring" personal sovereignty will never be a "boring" subject. 
Put simply, Gavin and Mikes vision of Bitcoin is small potatoes compared to what Bitcoin will be if we protect it from all forms of centralization.

As far as "problem"anonymity of miners and transaction censorship - that's complete BS.
The banks can choose who they broadcast to, also the banks can run their own miners and nodes so they never have to worry about that. 
I dont agree with the Value asymmetry argument - it misses the point that the more money pours into bitcoin the stronger the security gets.

When the core-devs are pushed they usually say it will be 5-10 years before bitcoin becomes a global powerhouse. But that is a conservative number in my opinion. 
I believe it will be 3-5 years before the early adopters, including small holders like the average bitcoiner are set for life.

This is not * **Negative News feedback loops**  I believe that there is too much emphasis on negative news here.

Again you fail to understand my position. No hard feelings, it is a complicated subject.
Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol, and is by virtue of its features and accessibility, a political game changer. I truly hope it heralds a new renaissance!
If we allow the protocol to be changed PURELY for profit motives, the enlightened philosophy of freedom behind the protocol will take a backseat to efficiency, and faux-scalability.
When you are talking big-blocks you are talking profit-motive. Big-blockers want more adoption so the value goes up now. They may think they are doing it for other people, but they fail to see the big picture. Anonymity, sovereignty, fungibility, stability.
I want to get rich too, but I can wait a few more years. Honestly Im more concerned with the freedom of my btc, than the price.

With Bitcoin as truly disruptive as it is, you can expect the US government will send its agents out to 
* 1. Understand it 
* 2. Find its exploits 
* 3. Search for its fundamental weakness
* 4. Capture it
NSA, CIA, FBI, SEC, etc - all those organizations can do is impotently fret and/or create regulations that cant be enforced by Btcs nature. Where as MIT will be able to gain a complete understanding of it and pass that along to whatever board is overseeing this.
I think Satoshi considered this in the game-theory of the Bitcoin software. Once there is critical mass, the distributed incentive for keeping Bitcoin pure is very strong.

Discrimination is a word which has been co-opted from its pure meaning of simply applying logic to separate and make distinct, units of a group from other units. Discrimination in its pure, non-racial form keeps the good guys out of jail and the bad guys in. If there wasnt THAT kind of discrimination, being in jail would be a rather unpleasant lottery. :-(
As far as the posts made on twitter by Nick Szabos account.
1. He has the right to voice his opinion
2. The issue of wether to help certain groups of people is a very serious subject and there is no right or wrong answer.
If Nick, by his posts is implying that helping political refugees by importing them into the western countries is not a good idea - I whole heartedly agree.
Logic alone could provide a clear answer regarding consequences of importing large numbers of people from a culture as distinct and antagonistic as the type found in Syria and other troubled nations
A big part of the problem with the relation between the West and these peoples is that in the recent past we have been victimizing and exploiting these people for material and political gain. 
To me, inviting these people in is like kicking a wasp-nest followed by removing all of ones protective clothing.
I myself am not responsible for mistreatment of any person or people - but I am from a culture that is - SO NO ITS NOT REALLY A GOOD IDEA TO BRING THESE PEOPLE IN
Use your heads people. Let the passions die down for awhile. Maybe 1-2 generations, then start inviting the people over for dinner. Oh and, stop letting your governments bomb them into the stone age while we wait for the tempers to cool. That will help.

No, IMO here's why
Assuming a protracted crash, China and Russia have now abandoned pure communism and are operating in a middle ground with capitalism. By definition China now has a growing middle class who want are part of the action on a global level. They are positioning themselves to take over as leading economy, what that entails is left to Chineese character. And once that happens, USA will become a bystander. 
As far as black swans go.
Im unsure if bitcoin will grow fast enough to really be a contributing factor, but its possible, and btc will certainly reap the rewards for being scarce.
Alternatively, maybe the USA can react fast enough to incorporate something like Bitcoin, and that might let the country hold on to some kind of power.

Actually, Im not downvoting you.
* People have to write the code 
* In order for the blockchain to be secure, nodes and miners need the entire block-chain
* The most popular software for nodes and miners is QT/Core 
* There are other full-scale stable software options available for nodes and miners.
How is this not decentralised!
People are choosing QT/Core, it is a market force! 
The whole XT debacle was a misguided popularity contest. People seem to think Gavin is the man behind Bitcoins success, which is false, and proven false - again, by the market. Miners and nodes have been quite clear, the answer is NO!
Making blocks bigger is a very important conversation that has been taking place all over the world for years. Core will support bigger blocks, soon, so really there is nothing to worry or fight over.
I just abhor the false polemic that has been created by who knows who, and this cult of celebrity that has formed around 2 developers, in support of their opinions.

The current state of Bitcoin is ...
* Bitcoin is still weird
* There has been tons of drama from just about every angle you can imagine
* Bitcoin is still the Top coin and it looks to stay that way
* We are close to scaling bitcoin with new technologies
* There are lots of newbs in Bitcoin who believe they know how to fix it, guess what, they dont
* Banks are getting nervous, they have started their own "coins" but those projects are starting to fail.
* Governments are confused with how to handle crypto, seems positive for now
* wallets are way easier/better then they were 2-4 years ago
* Bitcoin infrastructure is really picking up steam, hopefully adoption to follow
* Someone tried claiming he was Satoshi, the Internet shamed him away
* reddit has become a mediocre source of info, sock-puppets, vote-brigading, media psy-ops, crying wolf, and community fracturing was rampant, died down for now
* Miners and nodes are supporting the Core developers vision of the roadmap, but Bitcoin companies tend to be impatient about upgrading Bitcoin, notable people advocate "moving fast and breaking things"

* BU lost a block for roger publicly when his miners used the junk-tier software [forum] (
* Jeff Garzik couldnt code around core without Cores (Bluematts) [help] (
All of the best cryptographers and computer scientists work on the Core client - **Why would you get rid of 100+ of the best devs!**

History 101:
Checks and balances as we know them today go back to ancient Greece.
The Spartans knew that their very unique society's biggest threat was from within - corruption aka "Change". They knew the failings of Democracy, Republics, Dictatorships (AKA Tyrannies) from the very chaotic political history of Greece. 
So they created a system where each group vied with the others in a political wrestling match - the idea that each group checked the other and created a status quo which was difficult to change due to conflicting interests and political powers.
Spartan culture lasted about 600 years before the government was pressured to change the distribution of wealth from its concentration in a handful of families to the masses.
Sparta lasted about 50 years after this decision.
**Point being**
 
We dont want a system that can be easily changed to suite the whims of a rapidly changing user base. We need to think long-term, slow growth, steady adoption, with predictable outcomes. 
**The core-devs have fought and won the argument started by Gaven and company.** MIT says it needs to rethink its strategy, Mike has gone off to suck at the teet of the banks, meanwhile we prepare to scale bitcoin in a controlled, safe manner.
The core devs represent the intellectual elite of the Bitcoin experiment, without them controlling the core-software in a slow predictable long-term growth pattern we would have yahoos like Mike throwing sloppy code into the gears of the most important advancement in socio-political-financial technology ever.

It breaks down like so:
1. The Banks now have their own "blockchains".
2. They restrict access to the blockchain - "permission" because a POW system requires participation for security, and they will never get enough participation/security to adequately protect their assets.
3. With permissioned access the "Block-chain" has become a in-efficient database. Why not just have a shared MySQL database at a fraction of the cost? Because of Trust... In Bitcoin there is no trust, only truth.
4. To make a block-chain more efficient they remove the blocks and create "message sending".
5. The banks now have a Permissioned, Block-less, message sending "Block-chain"?; they have just reinvented the trust model databases they are using today.
6. The first major move onto the "Real-Blockchain" AKA Bitcoin, starts a stampede. **Be first!**
7. Bitcoin Price soars to the moon. We early adopters get rich, smart banks break even, dumb banks get swept into the trash heap.
8. At this point its too late to stop the innovation, so many bank services will have been coded into Bitcoin that the competition is fierce. Most remaining banks will fail here or be eaten by other Fintech silicon valley companies. It will be like the entire financial industry has been reborn into a start-up environment. Its a blood bath.

Contrary to what this dogwalker said side chains are important and soon to be Beta released. Because they allow people to innovate important features onto bitcoin without having to worry about consensus of the Core-devs sidechains will be the way innovation is added to Bitcoin in the future.
Right now the politics with upgrading the transaction times are so heated that there is almost no movement on any of the ideas.
This wouldnt happen with a side chain because in creating it you are not altering the Bitcoin code.
Say for-instance you wanted faster transaction times, like milliseconds - if you make a sidechain you can design it to provide the function with its own token denomination called fast-token, and when you want to withdraw your fast-tokens into bitcoin you are guaranteed to have the exchange take place without interacting with anything but the blockchain. There will be no gatekeepers, exchange hoops to jump through, just click a button and get exactly what you want.
Now Bitcoin can do anything without causing political arguments.

Holding an extremely risky asset is not "doing nothing", quite the opposite; it takes skill and determination to remind yourself why you are holding, to hold when the price is volatile (up or down), to ignore all the calls for bitcoins death, all of the "superior altcoins that will supposedly replace it, govt. bans, mainstream hatchet jobs, et.al. 
Just like Poker or trading stocks - other things people consider to be lazy ways to make money, holding bitcoin continuously and in faith of bitcoins bright future in the face of all the odds we are against is not lazy. 
HODLING is more like being a dutiful guardian of the most powerful economic force this planet has ever seen and getting to have a say about how that force is unleashed.
Another thing i take issue with, is that it is more arrogant to come out saying that Bitcoin "isnt something" than it is for other people to say Bitcoin "is something". No-one really knows exactly what bitcoin is and isnt yet. We know Bitcoin is a LOT of things, and we are still finding new things to say that Bitcoin might be.

Hodling cryptocurrencies is not effortless at all!
Anyone with traditional investing experience knows what I mean. Holding on to a security is not "easy" as volatility weighs on your psyche over time.
Full time stock investors are happy with an annual profit of 10%, and not selling after a 30% move up is considered reckless for a reason.
HODLers of bitcoin are considered lunatics for the volatility they endure, however, to be smart and creative enough to see bitcoins potential is not effortless. For example: the negative press, the altcoin temptations, the scams, the hacking.
 The work to get to the level where a speculator can maintain a positive gain through all that danger has been done, which is to say the effort has been deferred or can be credited to the past. Having Bitcoin to Hodl is the reward.
If speculating was an easy way to get rich then everyone would do it. But it takes real work to do well.

Cats are like cryptocurrency - there is infinite variation in the kinds of cats you can have. Some are mean cats (scamcoins) some are playfull (Dogecoin) some are aloof and mysterious (Darkcoin). But they all have magical powers which make them our cute fluffy overlords.
Some people don't like cats, but they only need to live with a cat and before long they will be struck with the "Cat fancy".
Bitcoins are mined by miners who solve mathematical puzzles. This is like the timeless cat puzzle of the chasing the red-dot. The miners endlessly chase this red dot, either alone or in large pools to be the first one to catch it.  As soon as they do catch it ZOOM! the red dot is somewhere else, and it starts all over. The reward for catching the dot is a cat treat (now equivalent to 25 Btc).
Most cryptocurrencies are deflationary which leads to speculation, in cat terms this is like cat-nip. Any cat who sniffs up some of this deflationary cat-nip will start getting REALLY frisky and try to collect as much cat-nip as the can get their claws on. **The summation of the global clowder of crazy cat-nipping cats clawing coins from here to China creates a confusing conundrum of coin price. This is also known as "volatility" and "price discovery".** There is enough cat-nip for everyone but it is still scarce and difficult to find, so it will take time for the cats who have it now to distribute it to the rest. This will make cat-nip very valuable as time goes on.
Govts are unsure about Bitcoin right now, it could either be a tool to be used by them or it could give people so much power as to threaten governments traditional monopolies. To put this in cat terms. Bitcoin is like Mr. Bigglesworth, and when Mr. Bigglesworth gets angry...Government officials will cry.

The advantage of Side-chains is that you can switch from one coin to another and are guarantied to be pegged to bitcoin when/if you desire to switch back.
Say that you wanted a faster transaction time that bitcoin wont accommodate (10 min confirmation time). 
For example:  you wanted to buy a pack of gum. The grocers wont do the 0 confirm thing with bitcoin, but they do accept a faster coin like litecoin. You can use a side-chain of litecoin to zip over your btcs to ltcs without an exchange, you will receive 4 ltc for every btc on the side-chain, and this exchange rate will not fluctuate when you switch back and forth.
Therefor if one coin has a technical improvement to bitcoin, you can use the Bitcoin Block-chain to lock your bitcoins and in exchange unlock the other coins to use them for the technical advantage. Its all tied to bitcoin so the side-chains would be boosting Bitcoins value rather than competing against it.

Of course some of those tx are normal people. And because of Bitcoins design there will always be a que to get in.

If an owner dosnt care/want to boost the value of Bitcoin then they are free to use any of the non side-chained alts. There is nothing preventing a coin from running both side-chains and non-side-chained clones.

I disagree about needing anonymity to be in the core of bitcoin although it is certainly a needed function. 
The thing is that not all transactions should be anonymous - such as the transactions of governments and charitys.

The intelligence agencies have sleepers all over. They look innocuous untill something wanders into their particular web - then like a trap-door spider they jump out to "fix" the problem.
I could believe Gavin was one of these "Sleepers"
Imagine this:
The govt cant get the best programmers in the world to sit around waiting for cypherpunk experiments to look interesting enough to subvert so they hire someone passable. Maybe a retired CIA analyst, maybe a handled &amp; edgy loose cannon, or a middle-road "reasonably competent" professional with an aura of legitimacy.
Gavin is just sitting there with his parrot, when suddenly it dawns on him. HOLY SHIT this Bitcoin thing is the real deal! 
*Calls up Langly on his Obama Phone* - This is agent Gavin Andreessen, my pass code is - "Loyd Christmas" we have a code red!
With the CIA briefing, Langly is made aware of the gravity of the situation and begins working on multiple avenues to co-opt Bitcoin.
*Boys, we never thought this day would come, but cash is on the internet and it has escaped the farm.*
Since Gavin isnt skilled enough to plant exploit bugs or trusted enough by the Core developers to continue actively contributing he is recruited to MIT to become the "Bitcoin Chief Scientist" - its now a PR mission.
Option 1. Divert people to compromised software and weaken Bitcoin security via mob-rule (XT, Classic, BU, Nchain)
Option 2. Manufacture false narrative to weaken community support for the free &amp; trusted developers (Blocksize debates)
Option 3. Cult of Personality: Get people to believe you might be Satoshi, remain distant, avoid the question, act mysterious - never directly say you are Satoshi, just let people infer it on their own.
If none of this works the mission has to be brought up the chain to the next sleeper - no one wants this as it means more work, yet more media hype, versus higher public skepticism and disinterest. 
After all this Gavin looses his seat at MIT. now we move to to the next phase...
Option 4. Sock-puppet Satoshi: Activate another sleeper - a higher up with greater skill, presence, resources. Agents will co-operate to create public-beliefe that one or both could be Satoshi. Rally the mob behind the next iteration of the compromised software. 
* Agent will directly admit he is Satoshi
* Agent must play the part of a hot-shot edgy computer wiz combining legitimacy with risk seeking (people lap that up)
* Agent must appear to be outside of the law but always a step ahead, remember he must be an anti-hero. Have him escape a police raid, make him disappear for awhile then reappear armed with amazing super-genius powers - like a supercomputer in a remote antarctic base.
* It will be expensive, real expensive but you must equip the agent with one of Satoshis private keys, but you cant because hes not Satoshi, so you use your national supercomputers to generate a false-positive but it will only work once.
* Use multiple level 0-1 sleepers (Betas) to confirm level 2 agents "Satoshi baller status" - 
* If any argue the technicalities of the weak *single signing* have "Satoshi" agent throw a tantrum, because thats what super geniuses do when they are asked to replicate a scientifically provable element.
Option 5. Failing the *Sock Puppet Satoshi* move to the *legal attack vectors*: Agent/s must gather patents on core protocol technology. Its a slow process but options are drying up at this point. To subvert in this way requires years of court battles and PR manipulation. 
Things are looking grim now for Langley, Bitcoin flew under the radar for too long - Gavin and Agent Hern couldnt catch it in time.
*Well boys, this is it, say good bye to civilization. You better pray for an EMP big enough to stop this or your parrot is gonna be on my dinner plate."*

You might be right, but people of this line of thought need to provide actual proof.
I dont believe bitcoin is ready for mainstream anyways. We need to ensure fungibility first.
As far as Gavins idea goes - it was a public and heated argument for years, Gavin lost because his solutions weren't real fixes. You cant scale on chain! you just cant, its not a hard drive space issue it is a signaling and networking issue which Gavin has never been able to prove his case over. He may say otherwise but the Coredevs responded numerous times with real response.
You cant win this argument, the two sides argued and the entire network voted - core won.

No, the blockchain is too important to continue including micro-transactions on the block-chain at ANY scaling.
Thats like demanding the library of congress in the USA carry a **printed** record of every tweet , every personal message, every notebook in the world. Its just silly
Microtransactions, though crucial to future socio-economic changes of the near future are going to be on a layer 2 technology.
Edit: **Grade-school primer**: just because the usg has done something dosnt mean its a good idea, just because google or some big-data firm is doing something with digital record preservation dosnt equal the Library of Congress printing it out and putting it on a shelf - this is a scarcity argument

Hi, I expect sub 1,000 before Segwit 2x is resolved.
A split in the network makes us Ethereum tier. If the network splits the entire project is in jeopardy. 
If you say, "But Ether made it through".
Thats because Ether is and always was a speculation for the active investor, not a store of value. So a split in the network is just a point to place a round of bets, with Bitcoin its a binary event (Is it a store of value or not?)
So dont buy till its back in the hundreds.

The scenario you outline can happen however it is important to point out that:

2. There is no such thing as "Fair distribution" only an omniscient being could ever calculate exactly who deserves what.
3. Even when few people control most wealth, with Bitcoin they cant print more. This one simple fact alone completly changes the game.

I think you put it quite succinctly, and I agree.
Ver and Voor both contribute in positive ways, but this recent schism caused by the block-size debate in no way helped bitcoin, yet they still continue beating their own dead horses in public view; and for what, rile up a small cohort of Chineese miners?
Anybody who keeps campaigning for interrupting the Core-dev roadmap is really sinking low. 
Sorry guys, the community hashed this problem out for years, the community has overwhelmingly chosen to stick with Gregs road map, so you should sit this blocksize debate out until Core has delt with it enough to call it a completed attempt to scale.

Liquidity plays a part in shifting the price.
Bitcoin is pretty shallow compared to blue-chip stocks for example.
The banks could not buy all the btcs fast enough to keep the price from going to unreasonably high levels.
The best banks could do is buy small amounts OTC (Over the counter) before needing so much to necessitate buying in the open.
Once they buy openly, the cat is out of the bag and the price moons forever

You are really high on the kool-aid there.
For one, the so called scaling of alt coins is a misleading pitch, and if you have been in this space for any real amount of time you should know better. If the Bitcoin dev actually felt threatened by an alt-coin, the technology would be added to bitcoin. If you are talking Dash's instant transaction you are taking huge security risks with the master-node design. If you are talking Ethers faster block-time and block size - wait until people are actually using Ether before claiming it scales faster - right now Ether is purely speculation, no one uses it in any meaningful capacity. When they actually have large blocks &gt;8mb then we will actually see how well it functions at a global scale.
By then, if ether actually survives the next few years, Bitcoin will have scaled anyways.


The camps who wish to change the governance model of Bitcoin have acted.
* XT 
* Classic 
* Unlimited
All of these were attempts to gain control of the network, all attempts failed because they couldn't gain enough support to even claim consensus. 
Payment channels are, right now, the only realistic ways of scaling Bitcoin. I will agree with you that the block-size must increase to completely scale up to mainstream use.
The overall point Im making is that long-time bit coiners on average know all of the points I have just outlined for you, which is why the network will continue to reject the "upgrades" being proposed to scale Bitcoin and change its governance structure.
In short, you're not fooling anybody but your associated kool-aid drinkers and the noobies.
