I want to move but currently theres a crazy 25 USD trading fee for moving 70 bucks..
Im new, so is this normal or only temporary?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:39:20
so do you go to often?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:22:21
cool, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:58:44
blockchain is the wallet, but I was curious after seeing a post where the Pirate Bay listed some adress to send bitcoin to, and I was curious if just anyone can set up a more permenant adress like that

common glitch on here and funnyjunk is comment duplication from mobiles, not his fault, and he wouldn't realize unless he looked over his profile right after making them
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:10:44
too many people here begging?
or you're deciding to not do the treasure hunt? Honestly the charity idea seemed pretty solid to me
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:42:45
woulve been so much easier to share just 1 picture yeah?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:32:44

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:20:38
ahhhh ok, thank you! All this time I thought whenever I tried to get an adress to recieve from, the old one was unusable and would lose any money it recieved
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:38:23
aw, why's it removed man? I was here earlier when it was around : /
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:21:26
this supposed to be a comment?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:13:56
damn good idea man, just make sure the charity isnt misusing funds before handing over stuff, I made that mistake once already
been using charity navigator to help weed out the fakes
best of luck on creating this treasure hunt sir, it sounds hella fun
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:11:02
I couldn't find a difference, just the quality of the pic is shit compared to the OC 
damn that could've been some real shit though if he did change it
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:27:54
ohno I didn't I just looked at the pics side by side, is it possible to make a custom QR code? I always thought they were given at random to prevent possible hijacks like this
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:10:51
 what should I do then?
