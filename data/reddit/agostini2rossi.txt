What is your last sentence?

So dumb. Kids used jolly ranchers as money at my school
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:50:36
Same shit. Learn you're its and it's's
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:55:57
Your argument is stupider
@_date: 2018-09-26 12:09:41
That's better. You said gold was "reserve money"
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:55:14
Money? Currency? Store of value? Confusion of these things makes you a good bitcoiner candidate. Invest now!!
@_date: 2018-09-26 12:30:33
Ahem. Gold hasn't been used as money in a long time. Only an idiot would call gold "reserve money." Ahem.
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:00:19
Walk away when you're done. Let it be.

Petulance is for the weak. Keep at it. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:59:26
Thank you for clarifying
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:27:11
Look at the post dimwit. It's talking about national currencies. Look at your comment. You're now saying your own comment was pointless. Wasting words. Go back to smelling your own farts. You're good at it.

Except he doesn't show up Krugman at all. He cherry picks an opinion that Krugman got wrong and uses that to prove Krugman is wrong about crypto. That's idiotic. He fails to directly address Krugman's core argument and blows his own main argument. You need to come up with an unlaughable answer to the exact problem bitcoin solves, and not ignore its serious shortcomings as a currency. It's all laughable as of yet. That's why it's stagnated. Also, cash is traceable, dummy!

Don't downvote people who school you. Admit your mistakes and be humble.

I'm sorry is that a question I can't tell because your(sic) not punctuating 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:07:26
Jesus... please don't give advice. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 02:29:09
I'm sorry. It's just that you contradicted yourself trying to explain how a price goes up. Get yourself into a learning mindset. Too many bitcoin enthusiasts think they know all they need to know and end up in a confirmation bias cycle that they can't let go of. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:20:13
Random date, June 4, 2018: $7484; Now: $6,443. 15% decline. Also a pump and dump?
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:20:31
You have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:03:52
But if you still had that dollar, it would be worth thousands now. Even those three cents would be worth hundreds. It only depreciates until it's rare. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:39:00
You missed my meaning. And it was so obvious. 1913 nickels are worth hundreds now. That single minded thinking will get you into trouble in the investing world. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:40:22
Think, for a minute, about how dumb it is to say "think about how powerful that is for a second." If it was powerful, people would just do it without you saying it. The fact that you feel the need to say means it's probably not that powerful. Why only one second? People can't think that much in one second. I don't think you're using "powerful" the right way. Where did the money "move" and how far?

Correction: 99% will be in a few worthless accounts. Soaking as a result of "accumulation" or "Hodling"...

Wont be as bad as Bitcoin Dec. 2017- present
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:53:46
Oh, so it wasn't bad if you bought at $18k?, $15k? $10k?
The stock market is only "bad" for people who lose money. People who buy at its peak. That's how it works. You don't know if bitcoin is going to hit $10k or $2k. If people knew, the price would already reflect it. It's even worse with btc because the are no proper valuation metrics to price it properly..., only faith by its fanboys that tell everyone that they don't know anything, or to just "watch and see."
@_date: 2018-10-06 06:48:01
LOL.. whoever sees this as inspiration is a fucking moron

If Bitcoin is out to destroy the world banking system, then I put my money on the world banking system. I think that's what it means by "win." Only one is left standing. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:09:38
A) You're lying. Nobody describes buying at "100, 200, 300." Stop lying pennymaker. B) My wallet is so much fatter than your plastic money clip, it's like when your momma got a fur coat, and a whole species went extinct. C) Millionaires don't comment on reddit. You got nothing but shit. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:35:30
Wow. A national currency in a bubble. Wow. So incredibly stupid. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:50:35
And, err, why bitcoin was worth $19k last year and is worth $6k now?
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:45:58
Hasn't it run out of supply of suckers to buy at peak? 
@_date: 2018-10-17 02:39:52
Okay, so these "unsophosticated" investors will push the price of BTC to 25k next year. Sophisticated investors, like yourself, are obviously smarter than those idiots. That's why the price is hovering at $6500 now. The dumb idiots haven't figured out what the sophisticated ones already know, and will be flush with cash next year to pump up your investment. I guess after that an endless supply of insanely rich morons will keep pumping the price up to $300k like the Winkledolt twins believe. Or you sophisticated ones will sell at peak and make out like bandits. In reality, only the dumbest of the dumb investors bought BTC in December 2017. Don't count on them coming back. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:42:06
Not true. An investment can burn to the ground or go bankrupt. In your case, it's blowing up in your face and you're sitting there trying to have an argument with me. Make no mistake. You're losing money right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:26:13
Hahaha... I will only if you stop losing your money buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:27:33
I do when I get trolled and harassed for being right about something.
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:18:27
Errr...  -3% in the last month. -8% in the last 3 months. Do these people know what bull run means?
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:47:30
Here's your problem. You're looking for optimism. In other words, you're looking for confirmation bias of your speculative decision-making. In plain terms, you're looking to remain in denial. It's time to sell, move on to the next stage of grievance, and then learn from your mistake. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:49:11
"speculation," not "investment" 
@_date: 2018-11-11 15:09:06
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:43:02
Well, also, unless it was december 2017, and you didn't sell within a month, you didn't make anything significant buying at 10k
@_date: 2018-11-05 20:04:15
Yes, you said "bailed out." He wasn't bailed out. And you're right, neither he or anyone else, including bitcoin holders, would escape harm if the "whole house of cards financial sector" collapsed. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:28:55
Just like when it was at 11k, then 8k, then 6k. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:43:50
Until you try to pay them in bitcoin... 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:51:39
OP means prices. Namely of speculative assets like BTC and gold. You Usain Dolt
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:00:31
I don't quite agree. I'd frame it a bit differently, based on risk and decision making. The return does not correlate completely with risk, although it's very related. If you have guaranteed returns, then it's never speculation. If you have returns based on your intelligent decisions valuing your investment properly, then it's not speculation. If you see returns, negative or positive, based on tossing money on tips or buzz, then it's speculation. Looking at price trends? You're definitely speculating.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:48:06
I remember having a stupid argument with you when BTC was at 10k and you were buying like crazy and calling me stupid. The absolute state of you, lad.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:07:42
Yeah, it was late January 2018. The price had dropped to 10k from around 16k, and you were calling me a moron for not buying the dip. I can see your attitude hasn't changed despite the absolute hammering you've been taking this year. I'm sorry buddy. It must be painful. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:30:59
Or, you can just sit there waiting while they work and get stronger. What a braindead joke of an anecdote.

I think he'd be less masculine, and more hipster nerd.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:52:46
Wrong. To be clear, you can invest your time and energy into making your house and property more valuable. You can invest your money in Certificates of Deposit, which guarantee a return. You can invest in government bonds which will also guarantee a return. This is not speculation. You can also take the time to learn about a company, learn about its valuation, and gauge whether its current stock price is a bargain. This is also not speculation. Putting money in stocks based on headlines or charts IS speculation. Putting money in BTC can only ever be speculation..., not investment. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:40:06
LOL 
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:28:39
Get your facts straight. He personally bailed out Goldman and other banks. The Fed never bailed him out. He's always been a value investor and was never even remotely close to financial trouble during any recession.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:59:43
Actually, the analogy is horrible. Ice cream has intrinsic value. It can be consumed and enjoyed. Its listed price is based on its intrinsic value, and when there is a sale, it's because, like you said, the seller wants to unload supply. The sale increases demand. BTC has no intrinsic value, or if it does, it's not possible to quantify. The sellers are speculators, and so are the buyers. When the price crashes, it's not because a group of sellers want to create demand. It's because they believe they'll get a better deal selling than holding or buying. It's constantly one group trying to screw over the other. Without valuation metrics to properly price btc, you have no idea whether you're buying a bargain or paying a premium at any given time. All you have is the price trend, which is the very worst way to predict future price. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:30:13
Does it matter? You buy 10k at any point, and you've still lost 45% now from hodling.
