Why all the hate care to elaborate as to why you think that?

Whats Pdiddys opinion? Did you guys ask ryan seacrest yet?
Really who gives a fuck, this isnt news this is gossip.

Alienware is made by dell which means **FREE NSA rootkits hardware backdoors** with every purchase too ... keep that in mind if you decide to give these cunts your bitcoins.

You are wrong, just watch.

doesnt matter they partnered with stripe and will support bitcoin soon enough
@_date: 2014-05-29 05:47:45
PSA use a different market.
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:13:21
hahaha thanks for the ELI5, but I know exactly how stripe works &amp; have friends on the dev team.. Applepay will support bitcoin once a merchant processor like stripe picks up the risk. Feel free to save this comment and revisit it in a few months :)

You would have to be retarded to still use a market that had the source-code seized by the Feds... check out there are other options.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:24:47
I know the blockchain is public but you fucks need to keep your noses out of other peoples business - Having a discussion/making a thread every time a large amount of coins gets moved is unnecessary 
@_date: 2014-10-10 03:16:57
So how the fuck do I use teraexchange?
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:31:10
I personally dont give a shit. Im glad every one who was using MtGox got fucked. They proved themselves to be quite incompetent from the very beginning and still you used them.

I dont think they could find a more unappealing spokesperson for their company.

Stop copying and pasting the same responses over and stirring up drama for attention.
Either put your cards on the table or shut your mouth.

What are some incentives for creating one? IE how could a company monetize ?
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:02:46
excellent, that was a trick question haha ;) most companies fail to realize how vulnerable RFID cards are.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:43:00
The sourcecode for this site would be interesting to see. Hopefully they release it
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:13:22
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:59:18
Anyone have a copy of the source, Id like to view it?
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:39:05
If you would opensource the code I would be soooooo happy :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:58:05
Far from a war. Embrace the change and hedge

Id be willing to bet Bitcoin is on the verge of becoming illegal for every american citizen
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:50:47
Are these cards RFID based?
@_date: 2013-10-12 02:19:17
CoinKite is kind of a shitty name brother, I love what your guys are trying to do though. Are you guys a bank? What country are you based out of? Why dont you whitelabel a mastercard/visa prepaid and add your own rfid chips?
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:15:16
Yep. Do they have a close relationship with a bank that they aren't disclosing? Im curious as to why I cant pull any tax documents on them, either they're using shell companies or ___????___

A billion dollar company operating illegally without the proper licenses. Lets see how long they last...
