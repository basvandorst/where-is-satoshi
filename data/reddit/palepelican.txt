Awesome, makes sense, that's the reply i was expecting. I just found the beginners intro to it. I'm going to do some reading later when i have time. ultimately, I'm just gonna drop whatever money i can afford and stick with it.

okay great! thanks so much, the comments are much appreciated. ill probably buy some now to avoid missing out, and then buy low if i get the choice. although, that goes against buying bulk.

lol fair enough, I'm in too! thanks for the reply

ahh, yes i missed the precision pointer. gotcha. i believe reading, understanding/research are the key aspects of investing? although as someone below pointed out that bitcoin isn't necessarily an investment. I'm definitely interested in buying in though. id rather lose money by risking it then keeping it in the bank and losing out on the reward for buying bitcoin.

thank you! i want to put some money in, I'm without a doubt willing to lose it if per say i can in contrast pull in high reward. 
Was i correct in buying form the local bitcoin trader? or do i need to be aware of some place else?

Wow, I actually had no idea that I needed to watch out for this type of thing. It didn’t cross my mind. I’m sorry, but what do I need to do to make a proper exchange?

undercover agents? bitcoin is legit though right, why would undercover agents have to be a worry?
meeting in person was kind of worrisome to me
