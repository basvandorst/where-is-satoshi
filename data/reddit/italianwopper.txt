lol indeed it does

Don't know, you will have to figure it out. That's just what Satoshi said. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:34:00
Quite bullish... I think a lot of people were expecting an instant decline but it seems they're taking it seriously. A straight "no" is officially off the table. This means we go from "no" to "maybe".
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:19:00
Of course it's happening. Many farms have been invaded already. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:26:34
I think that wall is the sell wall... it must be. I think Satoshi is trying to tell us something.

What happens when 99% of the coins are lost permanently to deaths. Can the world survive and trade on 1% of the remaining coins in circulation?

Oh well, I didn't know that, thanks for pointing that out.

What was the market reaction to the delay last year?

Also many people are buying tether, not to sell out but to hold tether in order to re enter. It's much more convenient than selling straight out to dollars. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:53:45
Nope, don't use stop them. Have done fine without using a stop-loss.
@_date: 2018-08-13 04:36:33
Considering they are giving white owned farm land without compensation to black people, who have no fucking clue what to do with it, it looks like the country is headed in a one way direction toward Zimbabwe's currency.

gauteng dont exatly know where their farm is, can't remember if it was past bronkosfontein, you know when you go past gold reef city.. further south. Ag can't remember might even be further north
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:28:51
Ahh fuck yes I corrected it thanks 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:00:30
I doubt they go advertising it everywhere...  i think they just want to be left alone to be honest. again, i dont know if they live that way.. but they're definitely in gauteng. Besides, it's nothing new really, squatters for years have just showed up on whatever land they wish. The only difference, is this time the government want's to make a move on it. So do you generally know everything that happens within a two hour radius of where you live?
I also don't know why you're so surprised, in South Africa crimes, rape, corruption, murder and injustice are happening all day every day, most if it get's zero attention because it's so damn normal. My brother is a doctor, and just in his small district alone he deals with about 4 - 6 deaths per day. Yes some are health related, but most of them are murders and attacks. And half of them, no-one knows or notices a thing that they're missing. Many of them don't even have id. 
When I lived there, there was a man about 4 houses away from us who blew himself up with explosives. A single father with children, he left his kids fatherless, the only people who knew anything where the people in our street. It never made press and no-one noticed, and probably everyone in our street quickly forgot, but i didn't. I bet you live within two hours, did you ever hear that story?? I bet not. I remember this clearly, because the kids used to always play in their yard with their dogs and i thought they looked very happy but then I noticed for a few months they wernt there. The reason the man blew himself up?? I suspect depression, loss of his wife or something was also a factor not sure. But the story was that he had lost his job through retrenchment, owed the tax man money and filled for bankruptcy. I imagine he tried to do some private work. Anyway, the government got nasty with his tax. Next minute social services got involved and threatened to take his kids away... said that he couldn't afford to take care of them. Which wasn't exactly true. Gov treated him like a criminal because of his tax debt as if he was a fraud or something. So i think there were court cases etc, but the point is, they FUCKING used his kids to threaten him to pay his tax. And Im certain they took his kids. How can that be legal, that was the real reason social services got involved, it was the tax. Fucking cunts, did anyone notice, did anyone hear the story???  Nope, sure the guy committed suicide which is unfair to the kids... but he had nothing left, do you blame him? I don't, fucking hell... I always wonder, what happened to the kids or the mother... and would things have been different if the government didnt act like cunts. That was 100% foul play by the government, they destroyed that little family, why is it that you didn't hear about that? Ok, it was a long time ago, assuming you still lived in gauteng several years back.
But my point is, you seem to think that when someone is done over by the government, everyone gets to know the story, the opposite is true my friend. Don't fool yourself.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:13:57
Yes people blow things out of proportion, although sometimes I wonder if they have a right to do that. After living in a country now where, petty crimes are blown out of proportion, you start to think... perhaps people do have a right to safety and freedom, and hopefully if you kick up enough stink something will be done about it. But when you, and every member of your family are a victim of some kind of crime, and not bullshit crime... serious shit. Rape, hijackings etc, and the police are so fucking uselss... blowing things out of proportion seems like a week excuse to try and ignore those things and live your life. And you have to do that, in south africa, you cant complain if you live there... otherwise leave. If you live there you have to take a positive outlook otherwise you'll live in misery. So thumps up to you, but i personally could never get myself to be okay with everything, even just the rape issue alone kept me up at night, having a wife and daughters... fuck no, im glad im out.
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:47:52
Show you, as in like send you pictures or articles or something?? Or drag you by your ear and show you? How about the friends of my in laws. Had 3200 acre farm, which was mainly crops. The government TOOK over 80% (could even be 90%) of it, handed it to locals... they wanted the whole lot but fought them via certain rights, as in it was their primary residence as WELL as primary source of income. So in response, the government told them, you can stay on the land and continue to farm, BUT... the remaining 15% or so where they live is now rented from the government. They PAY the fucking government for the remaining few acres, to live in their home and continue farming. Not only is it without compensation, but they're in a position where they fucking pay rent for it. They are GOOD people, warm, loving and giving. 
Their lives are fucking ruined, they are out of business, they farm mainly for themselves and sell to some friends to cover costs. The rest of the farm, is falling to pieces. There is millions of rands of equipment, they were forced to sell. Not only that, they GAVE... fucking GAVE some of the equipment to the locals who took over, in the hope that they don't fuck up all the DECADES of heart, blood and sweat into what they built, and at least not watch it turn to ruins. They have fucked up the equipment handed to them, their is basically nothing left but a group of shacks that have started to show up. The food and crops is mostly destroyed and wasting away because they don't know what to do with it.
It is fucking disgusting.
Now I already know what your useless excuse of response is going to be... that you simply don't believe it... a milk spittle cowardly excuse in order to spare your own feelings. But what you like to think or believe doesn't change FUCK all of that family is going through. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:50:31
Australia mate!!! Sorry to have vented out at you like that. It was tough, but very worth it. The hard part is just getting accepted or finding a way in. Employment etc, that's all the easy part.... which is funny, South Africans all have such a concern for employment, because they're so used to having an employment crisis. Like that's one of the main concerns... but actually employment is one of the least concerns here. The greater concern, is actually getting in and when you are here, the tough part is settling in and getting used to the differences, homesick etc. Which lasts about 2 years... after that, it's all good.
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:27:31
I don't blame you. Glad my family moved out from that shit hole.

I don't know, it was some kind of red looking pill. Satoshi himself gave it to me.

@_date: 2018-08-12 00:01:29
Satoshi said that 1 btc = 1 btc. It's the value of fiat that is going up for a short while, fiat is too fucking volatile these days. Stay with btc says satoshi. People are buying fiat for much higher prices these days, fucking idots will realise when fiat is worth what it was when we paid 1 btc for $20,000 fiat. Fuck, what happens when 1 btc buys you $100k fiat???
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:18:57
You fail to consider the OTC market which could contain up to 50% of the total transaction volume, if not more now. 
While small players on the exchanges are selling out, you say no new money is coming in. But if you look at the massive orders going through the order books by institutional investors in the otc space. Do you really think these big fellas have time to play on binance? No, and at the moment brokers are extremely busy!

Bitcoin will always be under attack. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:00:36
Because we can

@_date: 2017-09-15 08:21:58
I'll take a guess... it will hit $2500,if not $1900 then $10,000k

Good luck with that. The internet was adopted by the masses well and truly before it was regulated. In this case, the only push for regulation came from the Chinese government. Who, regardless of what people want, intend to serve their own agenda. 
And I'm afraid... most people, don't like that at all. Hence the reason why bitcoin took off in the first place.

Not at all, I'm at a loss and am not selling. You say that because you live in nanny state Australia, a country where all the boys and girls have curfews. Thankfully, other countries are not as pathetic...Did they really need a political review to change your curfew from 1:30am to 2am...really now. No wonder you feel that regulation will destroy it, in the same way Aussie has fucked their people over with their rules. We need this more than ever.

@_date: 2017-09-15 12:49:44
Register and get verified asap because his opportunity is not going to last long. Don't mean to make you panic, think clear and don't buy if you feel too excited. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:21:04
Even more reason then to not worry about the future of mining.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:24:12
that's right, tax, capital flight and also to maintain their inflation targets. Inflation is what controls the currency worth but bitcoin blows that shit up. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:17:09
I hope you're right, but I noted it seems like a persons opinion or "analysis" on the topic. Not necessarily a press statement / release. Let's hope so anyway, since I am holding neo atm.

@_date: 2017-09-14 04:36:16
Hopefully, there is obviously a clear division within Chinese politics that's why there are a lot of conflicting messages. But I think the majority in power would have incentive to try destroy anything related to decentralization. Not easily, good luck to them the fuckers.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:42:55
That is why you should stay away from it, if you are afraid that the thing you will invest in will end up a dud... you are then effectively coming here with a gamble mindset. First get do your research, decide if Bitcoin is a worth while investment and then make your choice. Don't ask for investment advice, rather research and learn more about Bitcoin and currency, and then you won't even need to ask for advice because you will know what the future looks like. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:35:51
Here's the official notice: 
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:23:07
It won't stay that way too long, until they start coming up with answers. Let's keep them out of it... rather.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:18:29
Yeh fuck off we don't care what China does. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:21:48
Correct, therefore the demand is not weak relative to Bitcoins value and trending. If it went below $2500, then I might say the demand is lowering... if it hit below $1000. I'd say demand could be weak.
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:46:25
What if.... the chances of 1 person owning all of bitcoin are next to Zero. 
Besides, you have to ask yourself... why would one person want to own all of Bitcoin? It would have to be incredibly valuable, or potentially valuable for someone to spend that much money to purchase all the coins. If that were the case, I'd imagine that as this person starts to buy all the coins... there would be a minority of people left over owning some Bitcoin demanding some pretty insane prices. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:18:13
Then nothing. It will just be the same thing, a US dollar. No difference. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:15:45
Yes back when China had 90% 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:31:38

We hope so!
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:59:36
Ooosh! Good luck, hopefully it get's that low. Make sure you buy back in under $2900 whatever you do. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:51:50
Suckers... you mean other people buying and selling like yourself. Good luck trying to fuck over Bitcoin believers, those holders ain't selling you shit. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:43:49

hahahaha true true
@_date: 2017-09-21 09:48:01
Any country that bans converting to a different fiat would become worse than north korea and isolate themselves from the world. 
I could easily trade to USD, then to Bitcoin then back to USD and back to my currency, or whatever other fiat that does trade with BTC. It would take the entire world, every country on the planet to ban trading from fiat to btc... highly unlikely. And even then, if the entire world banned fiat to btc... we'd probably have a decentralized internet where we could trade whatever the hell we like using btc. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:56:59
And they'll be hot on my tail... bring it on. I'm sure Chinese governments just love people like you.

lol bitcoin is not going anywhere... i was sarcastic
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:47:44
You obviously don't understand the difference between decentralization and centralization. A bank will never be able to offer a decentralized coin. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:12:41
Yeh hahaha same story different day.

Well well, it looks like things have turned again with the latest news coming out. Here is another:  
So which is it, your professor or the news that has just come out about the new so called shut down.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:48:38
This is what I'm talking about.
"Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said if China continues to toughen up on regulations to restrict growth in bitcoin, it may drive the business to the city." 
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:01:48

Try VPN or Tor..?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:32:08
Looking at your post history, it appears you want the bubble to pop. I very much doubt it at the moment, with an influx of new people every-time there is a sell-off. With many people welcoming the Chinese news, it's was obvious we would see massive buy orders. I was expecting some big buy orders, but fuck 300+ million in one shot was quite surprising.
Clearly there are a lot of eager outside people waiting to get in every time there is a dip. I think closure of exchanges is a move in the right direction, since this will open the path way to decentralized exchanges. There may be so called snap crackle and pops left right and center, but one thing is clear. Every time a bubble pops, cryptocurrency evolves to a new level. 
 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:26:14
They can go get fucked, of course they want to regulate and control it. Because they realise the only thing their bans will do, is the same as what antibiotics does to bacteria. Their call for so called "global effort" is cringe worthy. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:49:10
No, let's exclude all the exchanges that are shutting down. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:03:17

Yeh, that shit is very valuable.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:12:27
Indeed, the only thing China is going to do at this point, is provide an opportunity for new people to enter. This is excellent for Bitcoin.. I noticed when price when it was under it's most pressure all of a sudden we had an influx of new people asking how they can buy bitcoin. Because they realised, this may be the only chance they have to get some cheap coins. So while we could very well have some dips going forward, it's nothing to be afraid of, in my view there is more good to come out of it. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:27:46
And here's the thing... you can setup any system you wish... it is just that a system. In this case a financial system, or should we say a trade system.  The difference is, does this system solve a problem and can a society benefit from it? In this case it does, unlike the existing one which is full of problems, creates LESS value for society and creates more problems than it solves. Blockchain doesn't have to equate to real cash... real cash is not even real, it's paper. It represents something... real cash is just what you might consider familiar methods of payment, which reflects a very human response to change. And that's where mainstream will eventually slowly get it.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:50:52
I don't know, a lot can happen from now to then. I personally don't rely on China's movements since they are too unreliable. The 2x, not sure... but some are anticipating history will repeat

THe best medicine is to HODL... It's on the way down overall and you bought. I think that is fine. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:52:18
Agree. But do you think it's possible that everyone can adopt that attitude? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:10:02
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:44:14
Yeh, this is why I was telling people not to sell. Because you can speculate but you will never know. 
Don't buy back in yet, because it will probably still go down. 
Never make a choice in panic mode. Ever! You should still be fine, don't worry yet. Leave it and just keep an eye on the price. It shud go below $2920.. possibly $2500 this weekend if you are lucky. But if it were me, I would buy in again the moment it hits that $2800 mark, obviously to make back for your trade fees and withdrawal fees.

There's no "weak" demand, the article is just speculative. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:17:15
Then which news paper do you believe if they are contradicting? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:59:48
I think 30% is about right, then with cascade effects of about 40% until that corrects back to 30% because it's not just china selling out, USA and other people as well out of fear. So those buyers should return or at least new ones. Hopefully then we can get organic growth again. Im sure we will. At the same time, I don't think the full 30% of China will be dumped, probably about 5 - 10% would keep their funds somewhere else to recover. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:19:58
I doubt the price will plummet for too long, since most of the uncertainty has been priced in i think.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:33:26
Correct. I think it will break $3000 once more. If you look at the nature of this bounce... the second will be a surge right through $4k quite easily and quickly. That is why I warned a lot of people about selling out, because it's very very tough to catch that window in a buy back. I know you can set an order... but I don't trust the exchanges too much...
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:43:08
Told you they will come running back. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:24:38
We need diverse adoption
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:43:06
Indeed! It is an over reaction and a lot of panic. Most of a lot of the sellout are from people who intend to buy back in... and most of those people when they do buy back in... are going to miss the mark. That is why and how FOMO is generated... the moment you are looking at a chart that passes the number you sold out at... panic sets in... and you find yourself fighting over salvaging loss. Way too risky for me... HODL in rough seas... trade later.

+1 I drink to that. They somehow think they can steal open source software from people by preventing free use of it. Then they go and use it for their own benefit plus dictate who or what it can be used for. So yes, they can get thoroughly fucked blockchain is not owned by anyone. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:09:43
You can measure at least some demand by growth, some by interest  (such as the thousands of new coinbase accounts daily, new subs, etc) and also by the response of regulators trying to clamp down, if there was no demand, financial systems wouldn't have felt any effect. The opposite is true, because demand is on the increase governments are under pressure to enforce regulations. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:14:44
Hope not!! We need them out of it permanently.

@_date: 2017-09-15 12:07:22
Good luck with that. The internet was adopted by the masses well and truly before it was regulated. In this case, the only push for regulation came from the Chinese government. Who, regardless of what people want, intend to serve their own agenda. 
And I'm afraid... most people, don't like that at all. Hence the reason why bitcoin took off in the first place.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:48:55
I would use Bittrex. 
Electrum for the wallet. Verify it as a trusted source please! Otherwise you will lose your coins.

Yes, technical analysis is for day trading really.. maybe some near term ideas...it's not something you use to invest, it's something you use to hussel. And bitcoin is no place for beginner traders...long term holders yes.. but new traders will get eaten alive

I'm not going to read this, I just look at the comments and already know the answer.

Totally haha. They sound like broken records repeating the breaking news. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:39:38
Don't think of this as an investment. It's not, if you are planning to buy in only to get out a profit it shows one fatal flaw in your thinking. And that is, you are putting money into something you think has no future. 
If you want to think of this as an investment, the first and number one rule you should make, is to invest in things you think have a long future. Otherwise stay away, if you plan to "cash-out" it might show that you don't really think there is a future. So my advice is to avoid Bitcoin, because you will lose all your money with that mindset.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:19:36
You mean the great abomination of China.
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:21:16
Quite true, especially the South African government. Their reserve bank is shitting in their pants, they are such stingy cunts and make it very hard for you to take money out the country. YOUR money, if you leave South Africa, the government suddenly has all these rights over your hard earned money. 
With Bitcoin, it allows people to control their own money and if they wish to leave the country they can take their cash with them. So reserve bank, go fuck yourself. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:22:21
No they would not. The price will recover without China. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:38:04

@_date: 2017-09-15 11:36:57
Exactly. I have so many friends who are waiting to buy in now for the first time. Because previously, when Bitcoin was $5k, they felt it was too expensive. This time, they are ready to jump in but they are waiting for it to get cheaper. 
A lot of first time users will enter the market and get a new chance.

" but it's turned out Chinese Bitcoin holders had enough Bitcoins to drive the markets down by almost 40% alread" 
I'm inclined to disagree with that, as a lot of the sell-off would have come from the west as well... buyers waiting to get back in. I also very much doubt that the entire chinese market share would sell out. You have to factor a smaller minority who would choose to operate otherwise. For example, buy cheap coins and hold on in the hopes of a change in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:18:29

@_date: 2017-09-19 02:54:14
Haha yes, not different to fiat. They are just digitizing fiat which is basically the same handling our money online anyway. 
They will never be able to offer decentralized money. They are sitting with their fingers up their ass.

@_date: 2017-09-30 14:30:40
No, nothing like the banks.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:04:42
If that's all you think this is, then the governments would see no reason to take action. But instead they are responding viciously, because they realise that this can indeed potentially change revolutionize the finance system globally. So your claim that this "experiment" will never be used by people is incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:31:00

RIP China. Blame your Government. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:54:12
It's hard to 100% block them. They could trade to USD, to BTC back to USD and to CNY. We also may have proper decentralized exchanges in the future... for example if you ever used lbry credits. You can just download the software and run it from your desktop. In the near future, they'll be able to install a client that can access a decentralized exchange straight off their desktop.
No IP bans, No vpn required, no ISP controls blah blah. Totally different network. 
To totally stop and prevent it, they would have to prevent the CNY leaving the country totally. As long as they can covert it to USD, they are ok. I don't think they are ban, CNY to USD.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:55:58
If you are worried, I suggest you withdraw all your cryptocurrency and never use any of it again.

If there was zero demand, there would be zero value. The only person doing any fooling is yourself. You are hoping there is no demand and are probably just upset that people want Bitcoin. Bitcoin will continue to do well, and your little temper tantrum is not going to change a thing, lol.

This is nothing compared to when China had 90% of it and then issued bans, still recovered. It's actually China's fault the value rocketed by suppressing people and placing bans, it made people more hungry. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:50:08
If you want to warn Chinese people, you should warn them in China. We already know all this.

@_date: 2017-09-14 16:46:43
Incorrect. Here is the formal information:  your reasoning behind their so called regulatory steps is naive at best. They have a serious problem with capital flight, it's nothing to do with "protecting" consumers. Don't fool yourself, if they wanted to "protect" consumers, they would have factored in the implications of the billions of dollars in losses they have caused people who are currently vested in personally and commercially. I agree with you that this is could be an incredible buying opportunity. 
I also equally agree about the rumours. I have time and time again posted why we should ignore the FUD reports and sources by media. I don't believe any of it until there is an official statement or announcement by the authorities themselves. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:35:14
I see it as great news. 
1. Cheap buy in.

Incorrect. Here is the formal information:  your reasoning behind their so called regulatory steps is naive at best. They have a serious problem with capital flight, it's nothing to do with "protecting" consumers. Don't fool yourself, if they wanted to "protect" consumers, they would have factored in the implications of the billions of dollars in losses they have caused people who are currently vested in personally and commercially. I agree with you that this is could be an incredible buying opportunity. 
I also equally agree about the rumours. I have time and time again posted why we should ignore the FUD reports and sources by media. I don't believe any of it until there is an official statement or announcement by the authorities themselves.

No they would not. The price will recover without China.

The lower it goes the more ill buy.. and if it get's much lower I'll be going all in.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:26:03
I think a lot of it is self induced maybe due to the newcomers not experiencing notable dips. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:35:07
I also think a lot of people are looking forward to China's exit so that we can move on and get it over with. I wish they closed their exchanges yesterday already. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:09:21
That is good news then, with only 1% left over... it means your bitcoin will be worth a quite  a lot.

Yeh, just stand with your back to a mirror bend down and look through your legs.
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:40:18
Indeed, the other way to circumvent it is for the chinese to trade fiat to USD to crypto, to USD back to fiat. 
Although the NIFA is probably aware of this, they made an OFFICIAL statement that there is no legal basis for any trading to be taken place on concurrency exchanges. So if it becomes outlawed it will basically become illegal even if they can circumvent through Tor to gain access to exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:30:54
Not so sure, I thought the same but I think the sentiment has taken a turn and the anxiety lost it's effect. I think when we near $4k, there will be uncertainty.... not sure if it will cause a mass panic again...?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:16:00
Can they stop their trading today?
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:15:43
Just report the spam that's all. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:33:26
Correct. I think it will break $3000 once more. If you look at the nature of this bounce... the second will be a surge right through $4k quite easily and quickly. That is why I warned a lot of people about selling out, because it's very very tough to catch that window in a buy back. I know you can set an order... but I don't trust the exchanges too much...
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:58:07
Yeh, see you on the flip side. I'll be watching closely, no way will I sell but may look to buy. Selling at this point is idiotic.

I see it as great news. 
1. Cheap buy in.
2. No more China (hopefully for good).

I think people have already accepted China's situation. There may be a minor - moderate drop off... but don't expect mass panic as we had previously. I'm personally expecting the chinese to spam reddit with another wave of articles when they shut down to try spread fear... but I don't think it will have the same effect as before.

Doesn't make much difference to me if they close... I hope they do, it would mean we get some more cheap coins...  so i think it's a good time to buy a bit now... then if you're lucky buy some more if we do have a pull-back.
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:40:55
You should be buying on a down trend. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:55:24
Yes exactly. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:04:42
If that's all you think this is, then the governments would see no reason to take action. But instead they are responding viciously, because they realise that this can indeed potentially change revolutionize the finance system globally. So your claim that this "experiment" will never be used by people is incorrect.

It's good that you are a realist. And I see your point, and it's justified reasoning considering you live in Australia. But the rest of the world is not like Australia. Australia is far to shallow to know what's going on here. I've been a reddit user for a long time, just different accounts. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:20:32
Still interest in China? Surprising there are still a lot of buy orders. Why would China be buying bitcoins now?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:14:56
Many coins have limited supply, regardless of how that is set. You say artificially, yet we and our technology are a product of this planet just as gold is. And we didn't just do it with gold, every rock, gem, crystal, metal and even sand-stone has a value. Ask a geologist. 
There is actually more of an infinite supply of divisible digits that represent gold, when you consider inflation... care much for Zimbabwe? In the same way, your 1's and 0's on your computer screen when you log into your bank account, represent some metal. The same 1's and 0's on your computer represent a different yet trustless system of supply and demand, back buy incredibly valuable technology.

Yeh, it's okay. I see so many people posting on how they are making smart sell out's and buy in's on the down hill. Some get lucky, but most not so. Call me a fool for holding the whole way... but that's the best remedy in any environment like this. When prices drop, people panic and often assume they will fall much lower than what they do.. which is really the panic talking. While they justify that they will easily buy back in at a lower price and score, feeling that's smart right? Realistically, not. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:21:58
I'll take a guess... it will hit $2500,if not $1900 then $10,000k

Ah, yes of course but you get my point. There is a difference between original Nike and fake Nyke. I firmly believe that. If you gave someone two pairs of Nikes identical, same material everything and you told them one is the original genuine brand, while the other was a generic or copy brand. They would value the original more. 
And besides I could run that analogy across different goods not made in China, at least that I know of. I bet you no-one would pay full price for this chinese lambo

@_date: 2017-09-15 08:43:06
Indeed! It is an over reaction and a lot of panic. Most of a lot of the sellout are from people who intend to buy back in... and most of those people when they do buy back in... are going to miss the mark. That is why and how FOMO is generated... the moment you are looking at a chart that passes the number you sold out at... panic sets in... and you find yourself fighting over salvaging loss. Way too risky for me... HODL in rough seas... trade later.

Exactly. I have so many friends who are waiting to buy in now for the first time. Because previously, when Bitcoin was $5k, they felt it was too expensive. This time, they are ready to jump in but they are waiting for it to get cheaper. 
A lot of first time users will enter the market and get a new chance.

Actually I think fiat is the one fucking you. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:50:27
It just means another cheap buy for us, no problem. Besides, they can ban it like China, but it will just result in a deflection of the volume. To stop you need to kill the internet. No other way. China is having record volumes now in p2p trading. In fact, China was fucking stupid to ban it, now Chinese are finding ways to trade that don't need exchanges. When the regulated exchanges come out, these people won't really need or want to use them when they have already established other trade channels. So China has basically forced people away from the one thing they can monitor and regulate, exchanges. Fucking idiots.

A decentralized exchange, besides by the time every country in the world is baning fiat to btc, which is going to take decades for that to happen... no one will really want fiat anymore... so in response to your question of how do you get your "money" back... is Bitcoin would be the new money and no-one would really want worthless fiat. More and more of the money going into cryptocurrency will likely remain there forever.

Not at all, I'm at a loss and am not selling. You say that because you live in nanny state Australia, a country where all the boys and girls have curfews. Thankfully, other countries are not as pathetic...Did they really need a political review to change your curfew from 1:30am to 2am...really now.

Thanks for the reminder... 1st rule a professional "investor" would know...is to never invest in something you believe is a dud or due to fail.

Bullshit, rumors. If you actually believe this shit you shouldn't have or buy ANY bitcoin. I suggest you stay away from bitcoin if every time there is a report you're going to panic.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:35:21
I work in finance and fiat is utterly worthless. Tell your reasoning to 95% of the planet who suffer and will continue to suffer under the fiat system, regardless if it's digitized or not. 
Bitcoin is backed by nothing? It shows your lack of understanding. Bitcoin is backed by organic real-time growth, demand and solution. Why do you think it's so threatening to governments. It costs over $1000 to mine a coin and there is no controlling mechanism in place to try and dilute that. It is backed buy the technology itself, which solves a very important problem. If you understood the purpose of value proposition, it is the solution to a problem. The bigger the problem and pain that you solve, the bigger the demand and value it creates. Fiat creates more problems than it solves.  
Fiat is grossly artificial in value, we have money that represents gold.. Yet the value of dollar declines while gold is a limited resource supposedly to increase. This is because the value of fiat is artificial and controlled. How can you claim to hold a unit of money that declines in value, yet it represents something that increases in value? It is set and backed by nothing other than agenda, fiat is literally created out of thin air. 
If anyone thinks decentralized systems are not going to be met with force from the centralized powers, you are fooling yourself and shouldn't be here. But you are also fooling yourself if you think these powers can shut down the internet, or the future decentralized internet for that matter. 
Your comments... "It will retain value, as long as nation states retain their influence and power"? and.."people would want to mine worthless dollars because they wouldn't be worthless as long as they are considered legal tender"? This couldn't be more foolish. You mean like Zimbabwe right? I think Zimbabwe has done a good job of retaining their power, have you seen what their "legal" currency is worth? 
And your argument is a self referential incoherence, "as long they are considered legal tender". Fiat is legal tender now and it will be legal tender when digital, so what is the difference? Still, shitty and worthless, making it digital isn't going to suddenly make it valuable. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:20:49
It's mindset, when you sell, you have instantly made a loss. If you hodl, you have not yet made a loss. You could sell, make a loss and then buy back again in the hopes that you recoup some of your realized losses. Otherwise, just wait it out. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:12:14
Makes sense to me, if you look at their share around 2014 and the impact that caused... considering 90% of Chinese involvement you have high's of $1200, then a level bottom around $300. Today we are dealing less than 50% Chinese market share, probably around 30% - 40%. The impact will be far less. Also not the entire Chinese market will exit in the same way they did before, since they know that bitcoin will continue to grow without them, they have a partial sense of fomo here. A portion of them will keep their coins, possibly even try to buy some while they wait with hope for the long haul as the rest of society carry on with bitcoin. 
On the western side, we have idiots who have panic like headless chickens, they sell out with intent to buy back in. So a major portion of those sell orders are due to return relatively soon, especially since a lot of them sold at stupid prices. 
So your nett market share held by the Chinese is probably not as significant as some people fearfully thought.

@_date: 2017-09-15 06:59:48
I think 30% is about right, then with cascade effects of about 40% until that corrects back to 30% because it's not just china selling out, USA and other people as well out of fear. So those buyers should return or at least new ones. Hopefully then we can get organic growth again. Im sure we will. At the same time, I don't think the full 30% of China will be dumped, probably about 5 - 10% would keep their funds somewhere else to recover. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:36:50

Here's the official notice: 
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:54:58
In simple terms, no bank could ever create the same thing as bitcoin. Banks would create a centralized currency, basically just a digital version of fiat. While a decentralized currency is a completely different form of money. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:58:38
It's still fiat, fiat will never be decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:34:12
It could be pop john the seventh, I don't give a shit. The fact's are, ICO's are banned until further notice. Anything else is guess work. As far as banning exchanges, there is no ban in place so far and it will stay that way until the Chinese government, not professors or newspapers, decide otherwise.

Oh please don't start with that. The rumors are already out that China will open exchanges again.. fud off 
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:41:20
Incorrect, by that standard everything will have low demand, because even if Bitcoin was $10k, it would have low demand at $11k. That's a poor way to judge performance. A pull-back doesn't mean the demand is weak... it could mean there is uncertainty and that demand is still high, this is evident when people suddenly buy back the moment FUD has cleared. Demand is weak when there is a sell off for no apparent reason, when people simply don't want something or believe it is not worth buying. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:27:48
That's the spirit. Please stay closed for good. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:11:47

Yeh, it's okay. I see so many people posting on how they are making smart sell out's and buy in's on the down hill. Some get lucky, but most not so. Call me a fool for holding the whole way... but that's the best remedy in any environment like this. When prices drop, people panic and often assume they will fall much lower than what they do.. which is really the panic talking. While they justify that they will easily buy back in at a lower price and score, feeling that's smart right? Realistically, not.

Presuming your answer, why not just make your own one and gain millions? 
How is it that a piece of rock can have value? Who was it that said, oh thy shiny thing you shall be worth such and such... and then all of a sudden all these different rocks have values? 
We may as well take every rock known to man and create value they said, the millions of different stones, new ones discovered daily, shall be worth something... as we did. 
I find it more strange that we keep tons of metal, processed mostly inefficiently, stored away... and then create trillions of pieces of paper, also processed inefficiently... with pictures of people and buildings on them... create an entire system of trade on those papers, then reduce them to mere computer digits (because the paper is not that great of an idea after all) that now represent those piles of processed metal stored away by banks. Weird as fuck concept if you ask me. Who or what gave this it's value? At best it might describe the similarities of humans fascination of shiny things as do crows.
