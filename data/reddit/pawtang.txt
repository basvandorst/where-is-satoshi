I’m not concerned I was just sharing some thoughts. It’s ok if I’m wrong, most of us are wrong about investing more than 50% of the (money-weighted) time, that’s why some of us make money.

That’s like picking a new relative center of the universe and saying everything else is moving wildly in comparison to it but it’s not moving at all.  Fiat currencies are much more stable with respect to each other due to the fact that they are trusted to hold a stable value by the majority of the people who use them. Because you don’t have that stability available when paying with bitcoin it’s obviously a poor choice of currency in the current market if your goal is to gain and maintain purchasing power.

No. I’m saying it’s worthless as a currency when it fluctuates wildly as it is now. If it were relatively flat and stable like most usable currencies, investing in it would be like investing in the euro; less fun, but you could. 
And no, it’s not a problem for people to buy and hold, I just think that you miss out on profits by not buying and selling more often since you never realize your gains and then you just continually lose them. This doesn’t apply for people who bought back when it was low.

This is essentially a circular definition, I’m sure you know it’s a dumb argument though

My interest in discussing something does not equal concern over how you spend your money

I like to keep a limit sell right at the point that seems like a stretch, but still reasonable within the next day or so. If it goes up steadily I’ll remove the limit sell, but it’ll catch any sudden jumps and make me enough profit to be happy, then I can buy in again at the next dip

The price continues to oscillate about +/- 500 consistently around a slowly moving average. I feel like it makes a lot more sense and profit to keep buying and selling at safe fluctuation points than it does to just keep buying and holding when it’s clearly trending downward after the initial FOMO rise a week or two ago. Tell me why I’m wrong. 
Also if your reason to HODL is that you believe in the everlasting power of bitcoin; there’s really no correlation between what you believe and what the crypto is worth. Researching it more doesn’t change its value in the eyes of the masses. Especially when most of the masses buy and sell speculatively to ride the wave. Until you have a stable value, bitcoin is useless as a currency and therefore fundamentally useless in its only stated purpose - and once you do have a stable value, you can’t swing trade it or meme about it any more. So pick your poison I spose
