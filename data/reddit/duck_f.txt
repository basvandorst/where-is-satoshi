localbitcoins but the markup is going to be very high. card can usually only be purchased with cash or most people will no take .  the visa card might work with some sites that take credit cards. You might have to verify id as well.

Yes, I'm alluding to the fact that mining is not profitable now unless you are a company that made new hardware and can mine with it before its released or you have subsidized power.

or the start of a new one

Of course it would not make trader joes focused genocide. That is a ridiculous comparison. The FDA allowed a drug to be continuously sold, which had HIV in it, until the problem was fixed. They didn't tell anyone but they knew. Period. Now, If trader joes ,willingly and continually, sold food with HIV laced in it, that would be a different story. They would be on the same level as the FDA and yes they would be held accountable unlike the agents at the FDA.

Gavin really needs to stop smoking crack before posting on the internet.

I think the majority of the population ok with weed now?

Mine somewhere with free electricty or manufacture the hardware yourself and get faster hardware before everyone else.

Did you even watch the video or read anything? It's true. Concrete evidence.
@_date: 2016-04-05 03:38:44
pretty cool but I can buy usb drives cheaper and also store shit on it
@_date: 2016-04-23 18:11:18
That's because we have all moved onto sign language. Speaking is so barbaric.

That moment when a ponzi scheme miner just happens to take a transaction with a 291BTC fee.

Seems like a reasonable guess. Why would they be donating the money then? Tax writeoff?
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:28:35
they   still  do. try selling a good amount of bitcoin without an id.
@_date: 2016-04-27 21:21:01
It's being donated to bitcoin core and blockchain ect. not themselves. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 15:07:05
I'm  not judging you. I'm just being cautious. It could very well be a good service.
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:16:34
why can't you use it?
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:28:34
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:17:22
but bitcoin hasn't worked for the past 3 months according to @_date: 2016-03-15 17:24:20
Yesterday, I remember reading a comment on with hundreds of upvotes. It said that microsoft has lost interest in bitcoin and other big companies are probably losing interest...lol
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:55:45
He was using it as an example. I don't know anywhere that he stated it was a threshold line.
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:21:42
Nah ah. Bitcoin has failed silly! Haven't you heard from everyone on you better go buy some US currency and stocks if you don't want to be poor!
@_date: 2016-03-19 02:59:18
Yay another poster with an agenda
@_date: 2016-03-18 07:14:13
leet.gg has not worked for months.
@_date: 2016-03-28 13:42:06
exactly. coinbase was cool when it was just a wallet. well, not even then because it was an insecure web wallet.
@_date: 2016-03-05 22:13:26
the market
@_date: 2016-03-15 14:58:01
both accounts araf69 and bitbuilt have almost no posting history...hmmm
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:55:43
coin mama, but it's over priced.
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:26:40
found the banker!
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:50:14
I mean if he can't read how bitcoin works...there is not much hope. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:24:08
there is a lot of stuff going on with bitcoin right now that reeks of psyops. so many people want bitcoin to fail.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:58:34
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:05:11
hmm ceo of hushmail. they have been in bed with the feds for like 11 years at least.
@_date: 2016-05-07 03:03:37
I agree. Psyops is expected with something that can truly change so much.  I love theories. What if craig wright killed satoshi and he was trying to get a super computer to crack the keys to a drive with all the bitcoin on it? I wonder if the NSA's quantum computer can crack the keys?
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:13:48
You are guilty before you ever enter federal court.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:01:32
That's what should happen when someone tries to deceive someone.
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:58:36
Yes, they mostly use their brain.... unlike wright and gavin.
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:02:02
If any of the altcoins were actual competition to bitcoin...then yeah the developers might want to go into hiding as well.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:03:33
Wait you have to pay $200 to watch it? hahahahahaha gavin should not even be paid $200 to speak.
