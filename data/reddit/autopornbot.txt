I would put some into btc if you want to hold it long term. I think it will eventually go up to $100k or higher. But if you're looking to make money quickly, it's a gamble. We just finished an insane bull run, and it looks like the price is settling in around $15k. There are some changes happening soon and the price could go anywhere from here, up or down. You could make a lot or lose a lot in the short term. Long term, you're investing in the tech and the community dedicated to improving the tech - both of which I have a ton of confidence in long term. 
My advice would be to buy a bunch of cryptos, with btc making up the majority, and holding it all. If BTC fails it will most likely just be because one of the other coins proves to be the superior technology. So hedge your bets a bit and buy small amounts of all of the non-shit coins, but put most in btc because it is the flagship crypto. 
But I would just spend as much of that $15k as you are comfortable losing. Your government could make owning cryptos illegal next month, or some exploit could surface exposing the whole system as unsecure, or who knows what else could happen. I mean, you have similar risks with any other investment but cryptos are new so the risk is higher. And the market is inherently very unstable right now because it's all new. The current price is inflated due to speculation about what btc will be worth in the future, not really what it's worth right now. So if everyone lost confidence in it for some reason it could bottom out overnight. 
But if you don't buy any at all, you could be missing out on a once in a lifetime opp. I would at least take $10 or $100 or whatever feels like a minimal risk, and invest it just to experience how btc works. And if it goes up to $1M, your tiny investment turns into something big!

on coinbase you can set it up to buy a certain $ amount of BTC each week, using your bank account. It's a great way to dollar-cost-average, though there is a small fee unlike if you use GDAX to buy BTC. 
I've had $10/week going into bitcoin that way for a couple of years now. I think the fee is usually around $0.10 or so each time.

Stock prices rising doesn't really give companies any more money to spend. It keeps the owners (shareholders) happy, but unless a company sells new stock or sells some of their own shares, they don't get any of the cash really. They have to actually be more efficient or sell more products or something to have more money for employees. 
Many employees (especially at the top) do own stock in the company they work for, so it does benefit them - but only through higher dividends (which is usually tied to earnings), or if the employee sells the stock when it is up. 
Stock brokers and people like that benefit from a bull market, because they are essentially working on commission. Those big stock houses that we bailed out owe money back to the government - so some of the extra money the government is printing is going back into the government. Which is a really scary thing about this strategy of just printing more money to make the economy look OK.

I would be very interested. There isn't a good market available for me to sell legitimate products for btc right now without the risk that is inherent to dark markets. I can't risk selling on them because I live in the US and it's far too likely that the market will get taken down, and I go to jail just for being involved, even if I'm only selling legal items. But I really want to sell for, and support, BTC and other cryptos. I sell internationally on ebay, and I know that there are a lot of people who could benefit from being able to buy "normal" products online with bitcoin because of their country's restrictive laws or monetary woes. I know that cryptocurrency is the superior system, and the money of the future - but I would like to get in early, in a system that is likely to stick around for years and not just disappear once it gets popular and draws heat or the makers decide to cash out by stealing everyone's site wallet.

Another stupid question: 
Where is the blockchain? Are there dedicated servers around that host master copies of it, or is it floating around in the cloud in pieces that are bounced around from computer to computer?
@_date: 2015-05-17 16:26:09
Is that something that can be improved upon? If not, bitcoin is doomed to remain an 'alternative' currency (payment option/commodity/ledger - whatever you want to call it), forever. If it were to be used as often as, say USD electronic transactions, there would be a backlog that would become near infinite and crash. 
I'm a novice, I use BTC but don't fully understand the technology, so forgive me if there's something I'm missing. But it seems to me like that's a huge issue, a bottleneck that will keep it from ever being able to become extremely widely adapted.

When you set up a wallet it will give you a "seed" which is just a list of 12 words. It's basically a password that lets you recover your wallet if anything happens to it. So just write down the seed and keep it somewhere safe, away from the wallet. A bank box or at your mom's house or something like that. It's not recommended to save it on your phone or computer because in case that gets hacked they can steal all of your coins. 
I just use a USB stick and make a copy of it - so I don't even have to use the seed if something happens to one of them. Of course I keep the seed just in case. But that's one of the great things about the blockchain - the info is out there and can always be accessed. But the actual coins can't be moved unless you have the wallet and password, or the seed. 
There are fancy wallets like Trezor you can buy which have some other neat security features. But the built in security is already very good - so long as no one gets your wallet + password, or gets your seed. 
You don't want to leave a lot of coins on the exchanges, though, because something could happen to the exchange. Or the exchange could steal them - that's what happened with Mt. Gox, the first big exchange. 
There are also wallets online, like at blockchain.info. More secure than leaving them on an exchange because only you own the seed or private key (a private key is basically the same thing as a seed). Even if the site went down, you could recover the wallet. 
It's all a bit daunting at first, but once you learn a few of the basics it gets really easy. Just do a little research before trying things. You can set up a wallet with no risk - it is empty until you send some coins to it. And you can send one cent worth of bitcoin to it to test it.

Most alt coins are a little more difficult to buy. Basically you just have to buy bitcoin, ethereum, or litecoin with $$ on coinbase or wherever, then use it to buy the XLM or whatever other altcoins you want one one of the exchanges that trades them (bittrex, bitfinex, etc.). 
It's really not hard at all, just not a one step deal like buying bitcoins.

There's mountains of evidence if you look into it. Probably not on whatever news source you're looking at but if you look into it it's very clear what's going on, who is involved, and how. Just the lies and obstruction of justice are enough to bury the guy. But the money laundering is where it starts getting really dirty. 
Watch [Browder's testimony]( if you want to understand how bad this is. And while you're watching, remember that all those key players were working with Trump on building Trump Towers in Moscow and Baku. 
He's tied to Putin and several other Russian oligarchs on the sanctions list in the Magnitsky Act. He's lied about meeting with them and his staff has lied about it on multiple occasions, been busted lying about it and admitted to it.

Dollar cost averaging. I just have a standing buy order every week. It's definitely the way to invest. Almost no one is good enough to time the market - maybe some insiders, but not most of us. You just can't consistently predict something like that when almost any kind of random events can affect the market. And BTC/crypto is such a new market overall, you can't even say what the ceiling is. We could have already seen the highest price it will ever reach, or we could still be at 5% of what it's worth. But from day to day and week to week it's essentially just luck trying to nail the lowest price to buy or the highest price to sell at.

If it's so inefficient, why is China building so many solar panels for their power? Are they just trying to be green? (This is a genuine question, not snark - I don't know a lot about energy markets). 
It seems like solar is basically free energy after you build the panels. It seems like we could build them with whatever energy source we have and as we build them use them as the energy source until we're building all the panels using energy produced from solar.
I mean obviously there's the other factors to consider outside of just the electricity needed for manufacturing but with a big enough program you would eventually save so much $ by using the panels you've already built it would become super efficient. 
Do solar panels burn out after a while or something?
