hmm okay thanks for the detailed reply. I was just getting excited because the price was dropping. I thought I maybe could finally buy a BTC :D

How low do you think the price will go approximately before the fix is implemented?

I see what you mean but no he said that who ever made the Bitcoin was going to basically pull the plug. I didn't believe him because I didn't think that there was such a person who could do this. But he sweated on his life...

I live in Australia and I dis do quite a lot of research at the time about mining and I weighed the ups and downs at the time and it seemed worth it. Although now I'm not to sure.
