Let's not. This guy just writes a bunch of click bait devils advocate shit to get attention. That's his entire job. He's not worth the time or effort and we shouldn't reward him by giving it to him. The best thing you can do to fight against this kind of journalism and it's writers is to completely neglect it. Anything else will just drive traffic to the site generating the revenue and popularity that he's seeking.
I'd never heard of this guy and I hadn't read a ZDNet article in years until this was posted here. This is exactly the response the author was seeking.

Sorry, I thought I had. I must have been in the wrong section or something. I went back and did the very first problem. Did I do it right this time? haha

It's called a replacement because it's being designed from the ground up to have every non malicious feature that Skype does and to work as similarly to Skype as possible. There are already lots of "alternatives" to Skype such as mumble or jitsi, but none of them are as simple, accessible, or feature complete as Skype and that is exactly what tox aims to change. However, it's important to remember that tox has only recently reached alpha so it still has a long way to go, but has made exceptional progress in a relatively short period of time.

Did I do it right? I think it's really cool what you're doing! Any chance of Lua classes?

Correct. There is a distinct difference between open source and free software. Trezor's firmware was, but is no longer free. The software is still open source. This is exactly the reason why the FSF discourages the use of the term open source because it often misleads users into believeing they are using free software.
