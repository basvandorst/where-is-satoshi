Welcome to the club.
I think argumental logical fallacies only apply if I was trying to have an argument, or push an opinion, or counter a point of view. Was I was in fact saying, is that he is a fucking idiot. Nothing more or less. You are welcome to agree or disagree, I really don't care. It wasn't supposed to be a 'responsible statement', nor a 'claim', nor was it supposed to make strangers on the internet upset or give me fake internet points. If I have somehow caused emotional trauma to yourself or others by irresponsibly brandishing such a poignant rapier of a sentence, I apologise.

I got interested in NXT and even bought a few when it first got released. I then looked at the source code and sold everything I had bought. It was a disaster on every level in terms of code quality. I spent some time trying to dig out a good explanation of the main mechanisms and then gave up.
I'm sure that's not the case any more, I'm aware it has been rewritten at least. I planned to revisit it if I saw the market give it another chance, which it hasn't so far... Is there a whitepaper that lays everything on the table for Nxt?
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:16:12
I agree. There's really no need to advertise bitcoin, it needs to mature and grow naturally. Sponsoring tech events would be great though. Spreading bitcoin to non-tech-literate people right now is absolutely not what we need since it inevitably ends in disaster when money gets lost, people don't make 1000% profit overnight etc. People just want to push and push it so their stash gets more valuable.

Use a paper wallet, with an encrypted backup of that wallet in case something happens to the paper one. It's the best and simplest way by far.
- Be offline, boot to Linux distro from a Linux magazine cover for minimum effort
- Generate a plaintext page or two of public + private keys (use bitaddress.org or similar website that you trust saved to a USB)
- Print it **(Yay! A paper wallet)** - Note: Mint is a pretty good distro for out-of-the-box printer support.
- Encrypt this plaintext file with openssl (a one line command)
- Move the encrypted file to a USB **(Voila, a secure file you will probably never need to unlock and which you can copy anywhere you like)**
- Delete the original file, use the shred command if you like. Reboot computer.
Congratulations, you have an unencrypted paper wallet and an encrypted computer file.
Totally failsafe, since you now have multiple electronic backups password protected, and you won't have to use them anyway because you have a page of key pairs printed and hidden- unless your hiding place burns down.  This whole process is very, very straightforward and safe.
People seem to forget that the only information you need is a plaintext list of private keys (hell, even one private key). You don't even *technically* need the matching public keys since this can be generated from the private.

You are overly worried. The media does not matter. Bitcoin DOES NOT NEED MARKETING. In fact even good marketing just hurts Bitcoin because it causes too much price hike and speculation and makes the popularity grow too quickly.
What Bitcoin needs is growth, infrastructure, adoption. You are focusing on the wrong things. It really doesn't make a difference what we post or what the newspapers say as long as smart developers and business owners believe in it and work on it.

Good points raised in this thread. I think economically speaking bitcoin needs to prove itself, and the odds are against. I'm not an economist, I genuinely have no idea.  I'm betting on the coolness factor of a trust-free global programmable store of value. Also, the banks can't be fucking trusted with our money any more than we can be trusted to do cold storage correctly.
Most people newly interested in bitcoin are simply betting on a graph. I had someone say to me today that he is no longer interested in bitcoin as it is too expensive. I don't even know what that means. Either you are interested in it or you are not, and if you believe it will succeed then the price is a bargain. It's just the reality now that everyone will try to manipulate bitcoin to their own selfish ends and while the protocol is designed for that, maybe the human element will make it unfeasible.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:20:13
I don't care about a news sub, this one is fine for that, you can skim what you don't like and the important stuff gets to the top.
What we need is discussion about the code, the direction, the technological issues and how they are being addressed. This would be especially helpful for addressing the knowledge gap between those already up to speed on core development and those (like myself) who have an interest in software but are too green on historically debated bitcoin issues to contribute meaningfully to the bleeding-edge discussions on the mailing-list /

Reddit is a fucking terrible discussion format.
Short posts and memes garner more upvotes on Reddit than lengthy, well thought out ones, simply due to the fact they are quicker to read and upvote. Therefore the front page of any large enough subreddit quickly descends into memes and shitposts.
Also, popular opinions (especially American-centric ones) filter to the top and unpopular ones get downvoted into oblivion meaning you generally read through an uninteresting grey sludge of general agreement and circlejerking.
It *is* good for just getting the news and the most popular opinion on said news if you want it. But it's *not* a discussion forum.

Well said. Makes you wonder if a crypto-currency could be bootstrapped without the early adopter incentive. So much of the growth of bitcoin is fuelled by people driven solely by the price graph. Satoshi predicted and counted on this. Hard to imagine so many people on this subreddit being this fervent about putting their money into an experimental currency that doesn't offer a large potential return. Having said that, I am all for making money and I would love to see everyone do well out of it. I want bitcoin to burn the banks to the ground. I just wish we could stop stroking each other's dicks about it. Comments like "you've swallowed the red pill", reek of smug superiority. Let's allow and help bitcoin to grow naturally and stop pumping air into the speculation because WE are the ones who will get burned.

- You generate a public and private key pair offline. 
Send coins to the public key.
- If you want to spend the coins, you need to 'sweep' the WHOLE amount into a wallet or blockchain.info by typing in the private key.
- You could encrypt the private key in a text file at the same time you make the paper wallet- then if you lose it, you still have an encrypted file backed up in multiple locations, but you should never have to decrypt it unless you lose the paper wallet. Use openssl aes-256-cbc.
- You can do this with a bunch of public / private keypairs so you have multiple addresses pre-made to use in the future. 
All you need in the end is this one string though, the private key, and to keep that safe for cold storage. Even the public key can be recreated from the private key.
As long as you remember to sweep the whole amount into a wallet when you want to spend it, we are just talking about printing and protecting a short string of text.
To answer your question, nobody can steal the coins because they do not know your private key.  In theory, and theory only, someone could generate the exact same public and private key as you just by chance. But that chance is so incomprehensibly small you may as well consider it impossible.

Yea but bitcoin itself doesn't need it. People aren't stupid. The minute you start trying to sell something to them is when they get suspicious. Just using bitcoin yourself is the best advertisement possible.

I bought a curry for two people for 0.07 BTC last week. It was the first physical product I have purchased with bitcoin (non-software) and it really hit home for me that the technology was taking off.  I'm trying to get some zenmagnets from the UK using bitcoin as well but apparently they don't answer emails :(

Bitcoin doesn't need to be advertised. Don't treat it like a pyramid scheme. It needs slow steady adoption.

Doesn't look like they sell computers. Shitty website. There are quite a few other PC maintenance shops on Coinmap.
Move along, nothing to see here.

Yea I ordered the Single 60Gh/s about a week after the Jalapeno, not expecting it any time soon though. I wish they'd prioritized the customers who paid more, but it's BFL, worst company on the planet.
Anyway, I'm happy, this should pay for itself inside a month and I'm figuring the Single shouldn't have any trouble breaking even. Not expecting real money anymore like I was back in September but it's a fun little side project.
