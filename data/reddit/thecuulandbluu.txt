I'd say fees under $1 are reasonable, especially for everyday transactions.  Hell, they'll *have* to be.  And again, nodes having to run larger blocks for the same low fees could be a legitimate concern.  But writing it off entirely seems callous.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:12:19
You mean a stable price that hasn't fluctuated like mad, with fees less than a cent and transactions carrying through in a few minutes?

Doesn't that completely undermine the purpose of Bitcoin?  Why would I not just use a credit card by that point?

I'm not promoting anything.  I'm trying to get a better understanding of people's points of view.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:05:56
But they're not mine *yet*, is what I'm saying.

I don't know, I've never sold.  I was going to try selling a bit last night just to see what it's like, but then I realized I'd have to pay five bucks to move a few cents onto the exchange and then wait six hours, so I didn't.

This just sounds like a big long chain of IOU's.  Exactly how long will recipients have to wait before they actually receive their money?  What happens if an intermediary wants to pull their contract out from between two other users?
Edit: This is also starting to sound like semi-centralization.  You set up a contract and connect it with a shitload of people, then you get to act as an intermediary for everyone.  Then what happens if you pull out?

Ah, Heely's.  I wore a pair for senior year of high school with no shame.  Be warned, you have to walk like you're wearing high heels if you don't want to "Charlie Brown", and going down hills can be a bit of an arse.  Oh, and you can pump the skates by kind of zig-zagging your feet back and forth on the ground, or even just wiggling your front foot the right way, so you can just keep going and going.  You'll figure it out.
They're the dumbest thing you'll ever love.  Have fun.
PS get some gel insoles too, you'll thank me later.

Now that it's backed up like a Thanksgiving toilet it is, but back then I'd say no.

Just looked up this whole futures thing - it looks like a mix between a stock market and a betting pool, no?  Is that what Bitcoin is now, a betting game based off a betting game?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:37:32
Do you need the whole blockchain for every transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:51:25
That makes sense.  I admit, I had to look up the difference between mining and running a node, since until now I thought they were one and the same.  Nodes seem to be chosen randomly, is that correct?  That's a legitimate concern, and I admit I wouldn't have a solution for it off the top of my head.

BCH has reliably stayed around $1500 give or take over the past month, while BTC has skyrocketed by $10 grand.  Great if you're looking to make some dough, bad if you're looking for stability.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:34:19
So contracts are carried out at the end of each day, is that what you're saying?


It existed with Bitcoin.  If all we're doing is setting up a system that imitates what we already have, then I don't see the point.  Cash can be counterfeit and checks can bounce, but Bitcoin can still be used from a stolen wallet.


I don't... believe you?  And I don't see your point here.  And I don't see your point about the gold either.

It just seems to me like Bitcoin is going out of its way to avoid doing what Bitcoin Cash does, when it seems like the latter's method has been much cleaner and simpler, and the results have been immediate.  Granted their network and usage is much smaller than BTC, but it's still working for them.  It almost seems like we're in an arms race and BTC just doesn't want to admit that BCH has any good ideas.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:23
If you're trying to sell, yes.  You'll still get the same amount of BTC you purchased at that time and pay the same amount of cash for it.

Remind me why a Segwit2X blocksize increase would be supported, but Bitcoin Cash was put down?
Edit: I know Segwit2X was rejected, but now I keep seeing comments pop up that it's a viable solution, or at least plain Segwit is, which apparently still makes the block size bigger.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:15:18
Isn't that what Bitcoin Cash has already done?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:09:29
Okay that's fine and all, but that still doesn't address the problem that none of that goes through until some arbitrary point in time, and until then I don't actually see any money.  If someone sends me BTC on a network, I want it there and now, not some IOU saying, "Don't worry, it's totally yours, I swear".
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:25:06
Hard to get around, if you're hellbent on keeping Lightning Network.  It's an overly-convoluted solution to a much simpler alternative.

The video seemed to imply that transactions don't actually take place until the contract is closed though, no?  So would I open a contract, deposit money, perform the transaction, then close the contract immediately after?  And during that time, others could use that contract as a relay point.  So it's a bunch of mini-blockchains, is that accurate?
