hmm didn't think of that... didnt rene pickhardt have a video on his youtube on a possible solution for one way payments without an invoice?

they use a shitton of power and sound like an jet engine
no srsly tho, whatever room you put them in (even just one) will become unliveable.
also the most important thing is how much are you paying for kw/h... plug that number into a online calc and be amazed at how unprofitable it is (unless you have cheap power)
if you have free power and a place to put them (like a shed or a soundproof garage) go for it if the asics arent too expensive

if the price is higher or lower on futures someone will try to arbitrage by actually buying bitcoin
you see the price is higher on futures so you think the actual price will follow and buy, once the price has caught up again you sell. arbitrage.

yes i got that, but i don't wanna run your python scripts, so i'm asking for the option to just send you 10k sats, get credited on an account and then only have you pay me 1 sat every hour. one way.
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:56:02
if you can make this one way id actually consider using it, but running python scripts is a trust issue for me.
youd be eating the 1 sat cost to send the probe but at one sat you can probe a node once an hour for a year and itll cost you less then $1 (8760 sats to be exact)
it would only be testing receiving, but minimize the trust needed and i don't have to look at the python scripts and understand them
or let me load some credit (10k sats) on it once and then just use that to do the checks
also asking for "full name" is fucking weird for a bitcoin project imo and makes me not trust you at all. you really don't need to know my name, and i don't understand why you would even ask for that. youre just gonna get a lotta john smiths and john does...

the REQUIRE bip70. there is no way to get a normal bitcoin address. 90%+ of wallets people use do NOT support bip70. 
which means for 90% of people it simply doesnt fucking work. they get to the checkout, scan the qr code and their wallet throws an error. "damn fucking bitcoin doesnt work at all"... they don't know what bip70 is and they don't care, they just know shit doesnt work.
there a lot more to why bitpay is a shit tier company (s2x) but making bip70 mandatory when most wallets don't support it really takes the cake.


theres already like a dozen alternative companies

I think you need to tell roger to try harder, he's really been slacking off... this shit wasn't even slightly convincing, you really gave it away once you started talking about "core" and other classic bcash talking points...

value is time manifested in physical form
measuring value over time is hard and finding something that keeps its value over time is even harder... but saying "true value" doesnt exists is wrong. it's just all relative and we have no reference point to anchor it on.

btcpayserver + selling the coins yourself on an exchange?
there's actually a lot more, but i'm having a hard time remembering all the names
bitpay used to be unique, but at this point their just a really shitty company coasting on their past success
bit of googling and here's a more complete list:
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:08:56
bitstamp &gt; coinbase
use SEPA transfer

so far that has not been the case. maintaining backwards compatibility and making sure old clients stay in consensus is one of the reasons why softforks are preferred over hardforks (which would force everyone to update or fall out of consensus)
if you really want to use bip70 (lol why? it fucking sucks so hard) then just don't update.
you seem to not understand how opensource software development works and are trying to treat devs like customer support. nobody owes you shit. don't like it? though titties, use an old version or write your own.
also bip 70 is fucking horrible and you rly shouldnt be using it. don't believe me? try buying something on bitpay with a wallet that doesnt support bip70 (which is like 90% of them)... go ahead, i'll wait here, you come back and let us know how it went...
