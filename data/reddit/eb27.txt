That’s a beautiful point, we have to consider those Bitcoins that are lost. They’re the lost treasure.

Sorry, I don’t have another 20.99 million Bitcoin thoughts to add lol

Lol it will be 100k by this time next year. The bubble is not bitcoin. I already know what it is but I’m not telling.

And buy ‘they’ - I mean CNBC and the front end Wall St’ers working together to try and manipulate the price

Bitcoin is the gold of all this. If a bank robber steals a bunch of cash and converts it to bitcoin...how will they ever find the coin...they could say they lost the password...

"Bitcoin's price may collapse; its users may suddenly switch to another currency. But the chances are that some form of digital money will make a lasting impression on the financial landscape."

"[Bitcoin is] completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts… With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless."
