Isn't twitter's 140 character limit a legacy of using sms messages to post? Surely the limit has been technically unnecessary for a long time since no-one is posting from a Nokia 3310 anymore.
Also, the examples of imgur and medium as twitter's layer 2 solutions seem terrible. Twitter has been struggling to make money for years, while pushing traffic and users onto other services.

Is the maths in the cartoon accurate? And if so, is it linear. 
i.e. If 133MB blocks could support 14 billion channels per year, does that mean 1MB blocks can theoretically support about 100 million channels per year?

Doesn't it get harder to do the longer it is delayed?
I've read a lot about people wanting to implement various things (like SegWit) before trying to do a hard-fork. But I'm not sure I understand how those things will make it easier to do the hard-fork?
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:46:09
Isn't this a little bit... Completely and utterly untrue. I don't know how else to phrase it.
If the BU miners were to create a block bigger than 1MB, and the network decided to follow their fork, the only thing the Core maintainers would need to do in order to stay relevant is increase the maxblocksize in their own client. 
In the short term they wouldn't even need to adopt the emergent consensus rule-set. They would just need to change one variable to not reject blocks over an arbitrary and small limit.
If the miners, businesses, and a significant chunk of users were all to follow the bigger block chain and the Core developers all still said "Nope. No way. 1MB of data is enough for anyone"; would you still think that was rational behaviour on their part?
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:35:41


Why would it be catastrophic if 10% of miners went offline? Doesn't the network hashrate often increase by 10% a month anyway?


No it isn't. That's bad maths. Your cabal would go from 40% to 44%.

I don't think it really matters, does it? Strongly ideological people might be willing to pay extra to use a trustless decrentralised payment network. But the thing used by the other 99.9% of the population is going to be the "currency of the future".
There are lots of privacy centric email services for people willing to pay a monthly subscription. Collectively they are a like a flea on the back of the gmail's dog, and many of them will likely have gone bust in 5 years.
Facebook mines the crap out of their user's data and has publicly acknowledged they manipulate people's newsfeeds for experiments. They still have over a billion users.
Basically I'm suggesting that you need to think about what the average person values, not what you personally value.

Maybe it's not the best terminology, but coin.dance makes a worthwhile distinction between technical readiness for a proposed change and political support for that change. 
You and btc_is_gold seem to be insisting on referring to "support" in the broader computer science term. That seems pointlessly misleading when the term is already used in an explicitly different way in the data you are presenting.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:14:13
Yes I am making that assumption. But I also made a bunch of other points that you chose to ignore.
I just want to make sure that you - as an experienced and influential bitcoiner - understand that the "basic knowledge" you wrote up above is completely wrong? That a hard-fork caused by larger blocks wouldn't result in BU becoming the only Bitcoin client? That you are actively spreading misinformation?
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:10:41


Did they? The suggested sticky post only mentions F2Pool. I've seen the claim that "miners broke the agreement first" lots of times but there are never and details or evidence (something that should be really easy with a technology like Bitcoin). 
Seeing nullc talk about F2Pool put things in a new light. Isn't that the same pool that signalled for everything on April fools day? The one run by a guy who constantly says contradictory and inflammatory stuff on Twitter? He seems like the sort of person who would signal for Bitcoin Classic just to see what happens.

If Charlie *is* (present tense) Roger's friend then he wouldn't be disclosing that sort of private conversation, especially if he knew it would look bad on Roger.
If Charlie *was* (past tense) Roger's friend but they've clearly fallen out over the blocksize issue, then that would give Charlie plenty of reason to lie about this.
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:04:05


Kind of, yeah. According to the history books the block-size limit was originally introduced by Satoshi without actually discussing it with anyone. He put in a new rule, made a new release, tagged it as bug fixes and put it out there for the network to upgrade. Doesn't that sound a bit centralised to you?
There are a lot more people with eyes on the repository now, so silent changes like that probably wouldn't be possible anymore. But how many users do you think are thoroughly reviewing the Core releases before upgrading their nodes?
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:48:17
What are you Loling at? You asked if Bitcoin had been centralised at the development level. I gave you a clear example whereby Bitcoin was effectively whatever Satoshi decided it should be for at least a couple of years. He changed RULES. He introduced brand new RULES. He did so without discussing it with other developers who had joined him in working on the project.
It's not as true today as it was then, and I already said that in my previous message. But it is still true that most people treat Bitcoin Core as the default reference Bitcoin client. 
If Core decide to add/remove/change something then your choice is to accept what they want to do or stick with an older version of the client. The old version will stop being supported, bugs and exploits will be found, and eventually your choice will be to either accept the changes Core decided to make or stop using Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-04-27 22:40:28
I'm confused. The text you are quoting is exactly what I said. The 91% you are quoting as "support" actually includes a huge chunk of businesses who have made technical preparations just in case SegWit activates, but who don't explicitly want it to activate. 
**You are misrepresenting what these businesses have said and ignoring the very deliberate distinction that coin.dance has made.**
@_date: 2017-04-30 00:23:43
We're not just talking about an ideological disagreement between two gentlemen scholars. If that were the case then yet again I don't think Charlie would be disclosing details of Roger's private financial arrangements. 


You're talking about a public argument between two contraversial figures who have both spent time in prison. You're basically suggesting that Charlie would never lie on the internet because of concerns about reputation damage. But helping a criminal launder their money? That wasn't a concern for him.
Does that really sound like Occam's razor to you.

@_date: 2017-04-01 01:41:41




So, I phrased it as a question, but it was really more of a statement. Twitter's 140 character limit IS a legacy of using sms messages to post. That's universally known. 
Now the reason why they still limit to 140 characters even though the technical constraint is largely irrelevant; that is probably where your reasoning comes into play. But that's just an example of Twitter's owners wanting to keep an artificial constraint in place for reasons other than it was originally intended.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:25:55
For an individual it is a fairly simple split: you either "want" SegWit, "Do not want" SegWit, or you just don't care.
For a Bitcoin related company it's more complicated because you can "want" or "not want" SegWit, and your code base can "support" or "not support" SegWit's transaction format in a technical sense.
My interpretation of the plot is:
Green - we support the activation of SegWit both technically and politically.  
Blue - we support SegWit at a technical level but don't have a strong political view on whether it should be adopted or not.  
Grey - we don't care, haven't made any statements, can't be contacted.  
Red - we don't want SegWit to activate.
It's theoretically possible that some company could politically support SegWit but not have made the code changes necessary to accept SegWit transactions. But it was released more than 6 months ago, so that category isn't worth acknowledging.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:34:47


No, it's not. The whole reason the two categories exist is because some people were saying that any company that could accept SegWit transactions (anyone running recent versions of Core) must obviously "support" SegWit as their preferred scaling solution.
When people start talking about economic majority it's very important to distinguish between a company that is actively voting in favour of SegWit and one that is just technically compatible with SegWit transactions. You are misrepresenting things by lumping those categories together.
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:05:18
Because coin.dance already clearly stated what the terms on these chart mean. It's right there in the text you quoted. I think either you don't understand or you just don't want to.
The majority of the 91% you are citing are merely "prepared for" SegWit, they do not necessarily want it to activate.

That's weird. I read a paper that explicitly cited RAM as the biggest bottleneck in increasing blocksize.

I know there is a diversity of opinions on this sub. But are you by any chance someone who believes a small syndicate (or even just one guy) controls most of the hash power? 
Because half the time around here "Jihan is a dictator", and the other half people seem to assume that miners will fall victim to the tragedy of the commons, taking every last cent of fees if they have the blockspace available. 
I would trust most people who invest substantial amounts in mining equipment to realise that it's in their own best interests to maintain some level of fee pressure. I would certainly trust that a smallish number of pools would engage in some level of collective "price-fixing" to keep fees above some minimum. And I would absolutely expect one nefarious dictator to exploit his hypothetical monopoly to milk users for ever cent he can get.
So why would the fees be near zero?

If this agreement truly has as much support as this statement suggests, then the risk of the hard-fork causing a persistent chain-split would be tiny. Plus the miners left on the emaciated legacy chain would be economically incentivized to switch, since it's clear that this fork has the support of the economic majority. It's sort of like the way you think a BIP148 minority fork would play out, except with a massive majority on side. 
Besides that, the only reason the chain-split would happen in the first place is if people like you and nullc spend the next 6+ months desperately trying to get people to oppose the hard-fork. If you think consensus is so important why are you constantly trying to prevent it? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:21:46
Maybe i'm not understanding correctly. I think people are proposing that activation of the NY agreement should be done by signalling both bit1 (old SegWit) and bit4 the new proposal? 
However it would still be possible for someone who opposes the hard-fork to signal *only* bit1? 
Therefore the SegWit only signalling could reach 95% without the segwit2mb signalling getting to 80%. Thus SegWit activates, no hard-fork happens, the agreement is broken and there's crap all anyone can do about it. 
Am I misunderstanding this?

At least you're realistic about the prospects for "totally grass-roots, but mostly Blockstream-coin".
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:16:54
It's both. Have you not read "[what to expect when you're expecting a minority soft-fork]( 
The whole idea is to split the chain, then hope an overwhelming economic majority flock to the minority chain making it more valuable. This value will cause the miners to quit the majority chain (Bitcoin) and move to the minority chain (UASF). 
When the UASF chain becomes longer than the Bitcoin chain it is supposed to cause a reorganisation, wiping out and Bitcoin mined on the majority chain since the split.
Therefore Luke and others are hoping to blackmail Bitcoiners into joining their fork, and activating their desired functionality (which happens to be super-important for the company he works for) with the threat of potential economic damages if they don't. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:18:42
You know how the estimates of SegWit's effective blocksize have changed over time from as little as 1.7MB to as high as 4MB? That's because SegWit behaves differently and preferrentially to large complex transactions that combine lots of inputs. That in itself changes the economics of Bitcoin.
It's also true that the main reason we're seeing such a massive desperate push for SegWit and only SegWit is because it enables the deployment of Blockstream's lightning network. That potentially takes large volumes of transactions off-chain (possibly good) and also shifts a chunk of transaction fees from miners (who secure the network) to lightning nodes (who don't). 
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:59:45


And do you have any evidence to support these claims? Because there's 6+ months of evidence that the majority of the miners *don't* support SegWit even under the much safer less disruptive activation criteria originally required. 
If there were anywhere near 87% support we wouldn't even be having this discussion, would we? Signalling would have gone through the roof months ago and if that massive majority *really* wanted to push SegWit through they could have easily orphaned non-signalling blocks to push over the 95% threshold. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:18:55

@_date: 2017-05-30 18:36:56


I'm only willing to accept SegWit if we also see direct increase(s) to the blocksize. (NO, SegWit is not a blocksize increase, it's a fudge). So look, now there are two of us! Yay! In fact if you step out of your echo-chamber you'll see that there are quite a large number of bitcoiners who oppose the current Core scaling roadmap. That's why it isn't happening, not because of some evil Chinese bond-villain.  


He agreed to the NY agreement, because he is an adult with a lot invested in bitcoin and is willing to compromise in order to move things forward. Are you any of those things? 


If BIP148 had the support you are retardedly claiming it wouldn't even be an issue. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:36:56

You don't think that Bitcoin Core should compromise on anything *except* the criteria for safe activation of SegWit, which they set out in the first place? That's the one place you think it make sense to compromise? 
A literal handful of Core developers (not 400 contributors who have ever made a commit) have dug themselves into such a ridiculously deep hole that they are now actively pushing for something vastly more messy and unsafe than Gavin Andressen's original blocksize hard-fork proposal could ever have hoped to be.

@_date: 2017-05-24 00:00:54
I don't believe the text of this agreement is going to magically activate changes to the Bitcoin network. So they didn't circumvent anything yet. 
What they did is get a large proportion of Bitcoins most important economic participants to agree on what they think is a sensible and plausible root forward. 
What they *might* possibly do is implement the proposal in a non-Core bitcoin client. This would hypothetically circumvent the effective veto rights that a small set of Core developers seem to exert over any attempt to increase the blocksize. It doesn't mean the code wouldn't be reviewed. It doesn't mean the code wouldn't be tested. It doesn't even mean that people like Luke-jr or nullc couldn't give their views and feedback on the code. It just means they can't blockade changes that aren't their own.

Satoshi implemented pretty much whatever changes he wanted in whatever way he deemed appropriate. He could do that because Bitcoin at the time had almost zero value and was mostly being played around with by hundreds, maybe low thousands, of people.
If Satoshi wanted to make a change like - I dunno - installing a maxblocksize limitation that wouldn't be enforced by older clients and could therefore lead to a chain split. He just did it, because it was his network and there was little to nothing to lose.
None of that is true anymore. There is lots of money at stake. There are hundreds of competing cryptocurrencies nipping at Bitcoin's heels. And Bitcoin does not belong to the people pushing for "SegWit at all costs! And nothing else! Especially not maxblocksize hardfork". i.e. Blockstream

Many of the exchanges out out a statement some time ago about what they would do in the event of a BU induced chain-split. The major points were that they would at least allow users to withdraw both sets of coins, some of them would allow trade of both coins, and none of them would commit to any of this unless BU implemented some form of replay protection to ensure the two chains couldn't inadvertently reorganise into one in the future.
Presumably most of these exchanges will view/treat a minority UASF the same way.

Bitmain is basically the only company making mining equipment that they sell to normal retail individuals wanting a rig for their spare room.

So which of those companies is better for decentralization? 
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:17:38


And every honest person recognizes that this is a basically useless, extremely gameable metric. Anyone who wastes time and energy pushing node stats as a measure of support is clearly engaging in propaganda. 


You have no question about it because you get your Bitcoin discussion from a sub that through out a substantial number of users for discussing alternatives. If you spent all your time reading the_donald you've have no doubt that Trump is the best, most handsome, most awesome president the world has ever known. 


If you read between the lines you can make-up whatever explanation best suits your existing argument. The miners have expressed very real concerns about what will happen if Bitcoin scaling happens almost entirely off-chain. They want a viable long-term business. Is that such a crazy and corrupt thing for them to worry about?
 


The Core developers set the rules for SegWit activation. They were the same rules that had been used to successfully activate other new features. Changing the rules when you don't get what you want isn't uncommon but it's not usually something that gets so much organic, grass-roots support. 


With BIP148 people are pushing for a dangerous and coercive change to the network that will very likely cause a chain split. It is far more risky than a hard-fork would have been. 
The only reason why people like Luke-jr have started pushing for this is because they see BU signalling approaching 40%, they see the miners getting tired and skeptical about Core's approach, and they figure why not take a Hail-Mary shot at forcing the issue. 
When the dust clears either the bigger-blocks camp will have claimed "Bitcoin", or Core (but mostly Blockstream associated members of Core) will have introduced a new approach where a minority can force changes on the rest of the network. YAY! 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:51:40
Bitcoin's attempts at scaling are in full deadlock and have been for god knows how long now. The fashionable root forward here literally consists of:
1. Forcefully activating a change that the miners have refused to activate for the last 7 months. 
2. Watching the blockchain split in two. 
3. Hoping that exchanges and other businesses agree to support the minority fork, and it's coins end up being more valuable. 
4. Hoping the miners aren't too stubborn to stand their ground. 
5. Watching the minority fork *eventually* overtake the majority fork causing it to reorganize and wipe out potentially huge amounts of wealth... and that's assuming the stubborn miners don't invalidate the minority chain preventing the reorg from happening. 
6. Hoping and praying that after that nightmarish shit-show, Bitcoin is still somehow the dominant cryptocurrency. Even though it just demonstrated that it can in fact be changed by a minority group, just so long as they are manipulative and coercive enough about how they do it. 
Or, I dunno, maybe we could go with the proposal that has support from 80+% of the mining network, a huge list of the biggest companies in Bitcoin, and which achieves the same ultimate goal of activating SegWit. But no, that's boring, lets do the crazy retarded option instead. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:59:13


Yes, the ridiculous amount of time it has taken to get where we are means that neither SegWit nor a 2MB maxblocksize will individually provide enough capacity for mid-term growth. 
It's also important to test/prove whether a hard-fork can be conducted on a network this large. If it is not then the miners will have to change their long-term plans to account for the lack of on-chain transaction capacity (i.e. figure out which other coin they are going to mine on).
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:22:05
He means that the reluctance to scale Bitcoin with on chain transactions is allegedly to prevent full nodes from being pushed off the network by increased computational requirements. But modest blocksize increases would only remove the weakest, cheapest hobby nodes on the network.

The only thing these companies have circumvented with this statement is the Core developers. And the only reason the developers were circumvented is apparently none of them would agree to attend this meeting. 
People have been talking about the importance of the economic majority for ages. 
"A BU fork would never work because economic nodes will reject it".  
"A minority BIP148 chain-split will force the miners to switch over because the economy will support it"

This is an oxymoron. You want to reject a proposal that clearly has very broad support across the economic majority and miners. And instead attempt force through a controversial change, likely causing a chain-split in the process.

My comment (and all these other responses to your first comment) have little to do with the proposal. We are all trying to point out to you how unhelpfully naive you are being by saying you will run anything Core puts out. 
If that's really how you feel then fine, run whatever Core releases. But why are you bothering to engage in discussions about Bitcoin's direction when you don't actually have an opinion of your own?

It's true. Satoshi did make unilateral changes and put them out with little or no review in the early days. 
If he hadn't done that we might never have had the static maxblocksize limit that has caused all this drama. It's a perfect example of why you should think critically about what changes are/aren't being implemented rather than just assuming that "Core knows what's good for me".

There is a perfectly good and blatantly obvious reason not to signal for both the NY agreement and SegWit only activation.
If 20% of the mining power is owned (or rented) by someone who only wants SegWit and only SegWit, then the NY agreement could bring in the extra 75% they need, while still falling short of the 80% threshold needed to activate the hard-fork. 
After the last few years you cannot possibly expect people to trust that others will do the right thing. This agreement must be implemented in a way that unequivocally enforces both elements.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:26:56
I'm talking about long-term plans. SHA256 doesn't matter for their long-term plans. On-chain capacity and maximizing their future fee revenue matters. If they have to start working on ASICs for one or more other algorithms then they should start ASAP. 
But the point is that they won't keep investing huge sums in increasing Bitcoin hashrate if they know they will never get more than a few hundred thousand transactions per day. There is no realistic fee-level at which that throughput can support the mining network. The only way to gradually replace the block-reward is by substantially increasing the on-chain capacity, and that will require a hard-fork. If it can't be done now, then it won't be doable in the future.

The fun part about effective narrative control is that it takes time and practice to get it right. Auto-moderating every comment that hits a particular keyword is like smashing things with a big hammer. Everyone can see what you're doing and you accidentally keep hitting people who are on your side. 
If a more experienced and nuanced moderation team wanted to dispel accusations of censorship, the smartest thing to do would be to let *some* dissenting opinions through. If post X hasn't been removed or account Y hasn't been banned, then surely there isn't a problem.
But once you've already banned most of the people who disagree with you, the remaining voices of dissent start to look like fringe minorities yelling unpopular opinions. If the banned people try to come back with new accounts then they are easy to discredit. They're just month old sockpuppets. They're brigading from rbtc. Don't listen to them - just like the message OP's post is trying to deliver.

Bitcoin's security and advantage over alt-coins stems in part from the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in its mining network. After a proof of work fork, not only would Bitcoin reset to being vulnerable to anyone with a large botnet, but one of more sha256 alt-coins would see large increases in their hashrate thus drawing the attention of potential crypto-currency users.
Do things that affect Bitcoin's long term success not relate to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:35:52
I mostly agree, but I think you may have missed my point. 
There is actually rather a lot of real-estate between raspberry pi nodes and data centre nodes. 2MB, 4MB, even 8MB blocks would not be problematic for anyone with a half decent computer. 
The Jihan tweet that everyone seems so upset about is really just saying that a global decentralised currency network shouldn't be limited by the requirement to run on extremely cheap low-powered hardware or network connections. The Core developers seems
so carried away with seeing if they *could* scale Bitcoin with tiny little blocks, that they didn't stop and think if they *should*.

Nullc's comment was referring specifically to Jeff rejecting Luke's attempt to join the discussion.

The idea that Jihan Wu has been the mysterious Bond villian driving blocksize discussions for the last three years is laughably ridiculous.

This sounds like slightly confused talking points. 
The miners want larger blocks because they know that longer term they will make greater fees from millions of small fee transactions than they will from thousands of high fee transactions. 
Yes, bitcoin would become less decentralised at higher block sizes. But where do you think the acceptable trade-off for that occurs? Is it really a blocksize of 1MB? A value picked arbitrarily by Satoshi seven long years ago? Is is a block weight of 4MB? And if so, why is that value Ok, but 8MB is catastrophic?

People have been harping on about the importance of the economic majority for many months on this sub. I can't be arsed to look, but I strongly suspect you've made comments like that yourself in the past. 
Well good news! The economic majority just signed a statement collectively agreeing to a way forward. 
The biggest, oldest companies in Bitcoin. Companies that basically helped found the economy we now all benefit from. Plus the overwhelming majority of mining pools. They all signed up to an agreement.
But you don't like the agreement because it isn't exactly 100% the one and only thing that Core/Blockstream/Mostly just Greg fucking Maxwell has been pushing for. So now all those companies and miners don't count anymore. 
Why should we listen to the businesses like Coinbase and Bitpay? I mean what have they ever done for bitcoin? (The answer is a fuck-ton btw) And why should we trust their intentions? Just because they've built their entire businesses around the usage of Bitcoin doesn't mean they have Bitcoin's best interests at heart. 
No no. We should really go with the plan coming out of Blockstream. You know, that company that hasn't released any products in three years. That company whose only plan seems to be building products that work *around* using Bitcoin directly. That company that has been pushing for changes to bitcoin to enable their off-chain products, while simultaneously blockading any attempt to simply increase Bitcoin's on-chain capacity. They definitely have the best interests of Bitcoin at heart. 
Can you honestly not see how crazy this sounds. You're attacking the very people who jump-started Bitcoin's economy, and the developers who worked alongside Satoshi, and the miners who invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the network. And you're doing all of that to defend the scaling plan of a company that literally hasn't shipped a product with three years and $75 million in funding to work with.

"They" wanted 20MB blocks but certain Core devs shouted a bunch of FUD while providing no estimate of what they *did* consider to be an acceptable blocksize. 
Then "they" proposed a progressive scaling starting at 8MB, and continuing upwards decades into the future, thus taking advantage of the very very likely technological improvements that will occur over the next 30 years. But certain Core devs said made misleading statements about crazy 8GB blocks, about a 75% miner signalling threshold being to low, and a one month grace period being too short. Again these particular devs avoided saying what blocksize, threshold or time period would be acceptable. 
Then "they" proposed just forking the limit to 2MB. Not because anyone thinks that will provide a long-term solution to Bitcoin scaling, but because it was such a piddling little change that it forced those certain Core devs to acknowledge that they weren't really against previous suggestions because of their aggressive size increases. They just desperately don't want to see a successful hard-fork happen. 
So yes, "they" want more. "They" (rational minded forward thinking bitcoiners) have always wanted more. "They" want a network that will actually be global money. Not just some settlement protocol balancing the books between mega-financial institutions. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:26:05
Basically all software ever written has some form of compromise. 
The original 1MB limit Satoshi put in was itself a compromise. He wanted a value high enough to avoid inhibiting Bitcoin's growth, but also low enough that if someone started constantly spamming blocks it wouldn't cause problems.
The schedule of block rewards is a compromise between wanting to eliminate inflation, but also needing to provide non-fee incentives to miners for many decades while Bitcoin grows.
The 10 minute block interval. The two week difficulty retargetting. All of these things, and probably many others, are compromises.

If you really believe all this then I've got a fun suggestion. Try getting the mods here to release a list of all the reddit accounts that have been banned from posting in this sub. 
Let people investigate for themselves whether it's all just spam-bots and trolls. But it's not. You know it's not. I know it's not. Everyone is well aware that a sizeable chunk of those "rbtc brigaders" you're talking about are just rbitcoiners who weren't allowed to speak here anymore.
I suspect that if the user blacklist were published, then within a couple of days someone would have a "blocked-name explorer" up and running and it would be extremely embarrassing to see how many regular contributors to this sub had to be purged in order to steer the community in a certain direction.

You don't think the pools would upgrade to a blocksize hardfork? Especially one that wasn't being constantly attacked by certain devs (who all happen to work for a certain private company)?

The argument isn't that competition is bad. The argument is that bitcoin is currently competing badly. 
It doesn't matter if your currency is increasing in value when the next best currency is increasing several times faster.

But most annoying of all is someone doing that, being called out about the fact that the entire history of Bitcoin refutes what they are saying, and then desperately scrabbling around to change the subject or pretend they were talking about something completely different. 
You have absolutely no credibility. 
Increasing the blocksize would absolutely help. It would not get filled with speculative spam, and certainly not in the space of weeks. And the time it would take to fill up with legitimate fee paying transactions is roughly proportional to how big you make it. Every single part of the statement you made was completely wrong, and you just cannot bring yourself to admit it.

I think the inconsistency stems from shifting definitions. I think it used to be accepted that the blockchain was for transactions, off-chain/2nd layer would bring *micro*-transactions. i.e. sub-penny automated payments for ad-free browsing, machine-to-machine internet of things type stuff. 
As time has gone by and on-chain fees have gone from a penny to several dollars people are redefining things. First buying a coffee becomes a micro-transaction, then sending $20 to a friend is not proper use of Bitcoin, then it won't be efficiently usable for anything under $100+ transactions. So long as it happens gradually enough, lots of people here seem fine with Bitcoin morphing into something completely different than it ever was in the past.

Satoshi also said he expected that eventually full nodes would run in data-centers. So how does that fit with your concept of decentralisation?  
By the way, when he talked about "honest" miners he didn't mean virtuous and righteous true believers. He meant profit-driven miners doing what was in their own selfish best-interests. "Dishonest" miners would be people sacrificing large sums of money to try to break or undermine the security of the network. I believe he even stated at one point that he 'needed a better word than "honest"'. 


I'm not sure I follow your point? Does "economic majority" mean literally every company agreeing to something? 


This is known as a "no true Scotsman" fallacy. You're dismissing these companies - some of the biggest and oldest companies in Bitcoin - because they support something you don't.

You should hop on the magical history tour of blocksize proposals gone-by. Greg and Luke (and Peter Todd, Matt Corallo) have repeatedly made it their business to say what can't be done without providing their views on what can be done. 
I.e. Gavin's original 20MB proposal was way too big. Ok, so what *was* a plausible blocksize according to them? Also the proposed 75% hashrate activation threshold and one month grace period were deemed to be too low and too short. So what *is* a reasonable and attainable threshold for activation?
If these guys had been constructive rather than heckling every proposal, we could have implemented a hardfork back then with a *two sodding year* activation period and we'd still be in a better position today.

I think people talk about bought and sold reddit accounts far more than they actually do it. It would be easy enough to see the difference between a 5-year account that had never posted in a Bitcoin sub until the month they got banned vs. real contributors.

Whats more, they didn't just put out PSA messages on major discussion forums. They made up a catchy nickname that was designed to associate this pretty benign feature with one of the biggest most famous security exploits in the history of the fucking internet. 
But that makes sense. Because you need a good name if you're going to build a [dedicated website]( to spread the word about SPECTRE's latest attempt to destroy Bitcoin (or a total non-issue).
Massive amounts of time and effort went in to the big reveal of "antbleed". Massive amounts of time and effort was then spent hyping up the FUD around it. Literally nothing has ever come of it, and you still don't recognise blatantly obvious propaganda when it's jammed down your throat?

The maxblocksize limit has been 1MB for the last 7 years. Actual block sizes have reached saturation for how long? Is it 7 years? No. Is it multiple years? No. The last year? Maybe, but arguably more like 6 months.
 
So why do you imagine:

Infinitely boosting the value of an asset by artificially limiting its total supply is a good thing. Valuable money = good.
Infinitely boosting the cost of a service by artificially limiting its total supply is a ridiculously dumb thing.  Expensive services = doomed to be replaced.
The way to make bitcoin transactions more secure is by maximising the profit that miners can make from transactions. That isn't the same as maximising the cost of each individual transaction. 
If some farmer says I can buy 100 apples for 50 cents each. Or I can buy one apple for $10. Which one makes him more money? Hint: it's definitely the 100 apples option. Not just because of the basic maths, but also because I'm not paying ten fucking dollars for an apple!
Edit: the apples are bitcoin transactions, just in case that wasn't clear. And there are dozens of other farmers queuing up to sell me much cheaper apples.

Internet analogies are actually a great example here. A UDP packet has a defined maximum size (~65KB) just like Bitcoin has a maxblocksize limit (1MB). 
The key difference is that internet protocols are not designed to ensure you only get one UDP packet every X units of time. 
If someone had written that sort of limitation into the protocol back in the 80s then this wonderful world-wide-web would not exist. We would have been unable to make use of improving hardware and network infrastructure. Or - more likely - we would be using completely different protocols that were written to replace the poorly designed one. 
If Bitcoin keeps both its 10 minute block time re-targeting *and* a static blocksize or "blockweight", then it will not be able to take advantage of future improvements in hardware and network infrastructure. 
In the long term it will not be used if it has permanently baked in limitations based on very conservative estimates of current technological limits. 
Now none of this means I don't support 2nd layer scaling. I honestly think LN sounds like it will be a good thing for small frequent payments. But I genuinely predict that if the current Core roadmap is followed, it will take us to a point where Bitcoin is much larger than it is today in terms of users/businesses/value, and is therefore impossible to hardfork. We'll get to the point on the map where the blocksize hardfork is penciled in and everyone will conclude it's too late. 
If hard-forking a $40 billion network is scary and needs years of work, how appealing do you think forking a $500 billion network is going to be? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:15:20
Yes it was. None upgraded nodes were booted off the network. If any miners had failed to upgrade they would have been booted off too, creating a chain-split. 
It exactly *is* a hardfork. Also water is wet and fire is hot, just incase you're struggling with these concepts. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:46:23
In what way does SegWit prevent ASICBOOST but SegWit2mb doesn't? 
The only thing the SegWit2mb proposal seeks to do differently is including the activation of a blocksize hardfork. How does that magically re-enable covert ASICBOOST?
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:06:56
Once we reach the undefined critical mass you mention, it won't be possible to hard-fork bitcoin anymore. You can not make backwards incompatible changes to a protocol used by millions of people and businesses. You can't hard-fork a protocol with layers upon layers of other software built on top of it. 
You really think a blocksize increase will be *less* contentious when bitcoin is ten times its current size? That's crazy. Even the most committed big-blocker will recognize the challenge and danger posed by a hard-fork at that point. Basically all the FUD arguments that are made today will actually be true at that point.

@_date: 2017-06-12 17:14:25
Maybe try explaining yourself better. It sounds like you're implying that if Bitcoin fails due to an alt-coin overtaking it, then all cryptocurrencies are doomed because people will never trust them. 
Is that what you were saying?

If Bitmain controls or coerces the other miners into doing what they want, why hasn't BU signalling reached a majority?
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:34:46
Since they started entertaining activation methods that don't require miner majorities. 
Not just Luke's BIP148 fever. From the moment they realized miners weren't going to activate SegWit without a block-size hard-fork, nullc and others have been saber-rattling about PoW changes, flag-days, and any other way of bypassing the miners instead of just addressing the actual reason SegWit isn't activating. Hint: it's got crap all to do with the propaganda about Asicboost, and everything to do with providing long-term on-chain scaling and therefore maximising the fees that will pay for network security in the future.

Actually I just make it sound like nullc is a narcissistic control freak who takes personal offense if anyone tries to deviate from his master plan. 
But yes, the fact that employees of his company also keep attacking any alternative scaling proposals, while advocating for SegWit at any cost... that does sound like a conspiracy, doesn't it.

Apparently this table is mostly if not entirely pulled from the coin.dance politics and opinion page. The main difference being that this simple table doesn't allow for any sort of weighting by importance. So one-man webpages that don't take part in any real level of Bitcoin commerce are counting the same as massive exchanges and payment processors.
This representation is basically useless for any purpose other than making BIP148 look more popular than it actually is.

That is concerning. I wonder if the manufacturers will increase supply to meet the rising demand. I bet they will, since that's sensible basic economics.

The statement was brief, and could have been written in a more explicit fashion. But it isn't nearly as ambiguous as people like you have tried to make it sound. 
How can you say there was no agreement of any kind when the statement literally begins:

[58 companies located in 22 countries]( and that's assuming there were no further signatories after the event. 
So what's your plan zetsyuk? What are your criteria for making sensible changes to Bitcoin? 
In the beginning it was indeed hash-power rules. That's literally how Bitcoin was designed to operate. The purpose of proof-of-work is that it's proof... of work. It's expensive and can't be faked, and that makes it very resistant to bad actors. 
But tons of hash-power is centralised in China now. In fact I heard almost all the world's ASICs are piled up in a mountain fortress with Jihan Wu curled up asleep on top of them. 
So most people have been advocating for the economic majority to determine whether changes are/aren't accepted. That makes a certain amount of sense, if someone actually defines what they mean by economic majority. 
Apparently it *doesn't* mean major Bitcoin businesses. Because most of those (including Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain &amp; Circle) signed the agreement you're bashing. I genuinely don't think I can name any still operating Bitcoin businesses older than those ones. They are literally pioneers in this industry and they have more to gain or lose from Bitcoin's future than any of us ever will. 
So again, what's your plan zetsyuk?
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:29:31
If Blockstream didn't create a giant conspiracy theory about Roger and Jihan, and at various time points Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik, Erik Voorhees (Shapeshift), Brian Armstrong (Coinbase), Stephen Pair (Bitpay), Emin Gun-Sirer, Sergio Demian Lerner, and basically anyone and everyone who won't follow nullc's plan to the letter... Then we'd have bigger blocks and fees of a few pennies right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:12:43
The community (particularly *this* community on *this* sub) has been citing the importance of the economic majority and/or economically important nodes (exchanges, businesses etc) for months.
A bunch of representatives from some of the biggest exchanges, businesses etc. Plus an apparent super majority of miners, put out a joint statement about what they think is a reasonable way forward out of these literally years of stagnant deadlock... And suddenly the economic majority doesn't matter anymore. They're just evil "business men" in dark suits trying to co-opt the network. Right guys? Yay! Another win for totally consistent arguments and nicely fixed goalposts!!!
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:44:32
The miners will be ignoring new rules that are being imposed by a minority of users. Ignoring those rules is absolutely 100% what they are supposed to do. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:28:31
But you aren't addressing the point I made. Hard-forks are hard because *everyone* has to upgrade, right? That's the real challenge. That's why people say it will take years of planning and coordination (those same people have been saying that for several years now btw). 
So how is that challenge going to be easier when the Bitcoin network is many times larger? How is extra user adoption, extra business adoption, extra nodes, and maybe even improved miner decentralisation going to make coordinating a hard-fork easier? 
It's not. That's the simple truth. It will get harder and harder and eventually people will just accept that it can't be done. Then some other crypto is most definitely going to replace Bitcoin because no-one will give a crap about the ability to run a node on a raspberry-pi when other coins have 1000th the fee. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:36:46
That's really great news. Reaching consensus on Bitcoin upgrades has become near impossible. Luckily we don't need to worry about that anymore because - according to this "game theory" - anyone can make any change to Bitcoin so long as they have the resources to start a tiny UASF and prop up its value to some tiny nominal value. Phew!
But seriously, some people seem to think the definition of game theory is: start with the outcome you want to happen, then make up whatever assumptions and predictions are necessary to make it sound likely.
If a forked chain has a 1-day interval, and a $1 UASFcoin valuation, that means the block reward is $12.5 per day (plus fees). This $12.5 cannot be spent for 100 blocks which in UASFcoin corresponds to nearly 3.5 months. 
So no, it's not rational logical game theory for people to dust off their old mining rigs to get *a slice* of the $12.5 daily reward, which may or not be worth anything 3.5 months from now when they can finally actually spend it.
If the fear/hope of possible future reorgs can actually allow a tiny minority chain-split to take over - let alone *guarantee* it - then Bitcoin is broken beyond repair and its miraculous no-one has exploited this flaw before.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:57:17
If the people on the other side of the negotiating table keep saying "no, that's clearly not what we want", then no, it's not the compromise. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:04:16


That's precisely the kind of pseudo game theory I'm talking about. I admit I haven't read the article and am just going from your helpful summary. But it sounds like completely circular logic. *If* the miners believe UASFcoin will become the more valuable coin eventually then it makes sense to defect. *If* the miners defect then the coin will increase in value. 
But if we assume the miners don't believe the UASFcoin will become dominant. Or if Jihan Wu really does control 70% of hashrate and is dead against the UASF, then it has zero chance of success. Ta-da, "game theory".
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:08:12
What definition of economic majority are you using here? 
Miners will mine the coin that they can sell. Exchanges will list the thing that they think is Bitcoin. They may also list a forked off alt-coin so long as it has replay protection (BIP148 deliberately doesn't btw). Users will buy the Bitcoin that the exchanges support.
While no individual group has the power to force the others to switch to its own desired version of Bitcoin, I think it's safe to say that exchanges will lead rather than follow. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:48:55
Persuade certain Core devs to remove their heads from their own bottoms and work with the people they have been alienating for the last couple of years. 
A hard-fork that wasn't being attacked by people like Luke and Greg would actually be pretty straight forward to activate. And with everyone pulling in the same direction there would be a lot less market uncertainty about whether Bitcoin ever actually *will* scale, which is partly the cause for the recent alt-coin explosion. 
I'm not saying there wouldn't still be some risk in the 6 month time-frame for a HF. But a lot less risk than the current game of chicken being played with BIP148. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:53:07
BIP149 is a flag-day activation that does not require a majority of mining support. Have I got that wrong? 
You want me to prove that nullc has talked about changing the PoW algorithm in specific conversations about SegWit's lack of activation? You're actually saying you don't think that's true? Or you just want me to waste my time?
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:48:52
BIP148 will cause a chain split if the majority of miners don't support it (within the 2 month deadline). A HF will cause a split if a minority of miners don't support it by the 6 month deadline. 
Core has given the miners 7, maybe 8 months to support SegWit and the majority has not signaled support. 
Core has never given the miners, or anyone else the opportunity to support a blocksize increase. Apparently they are *so* certain that people don't want to increase the blocksize, there isn't even any point in putting out the option...

As I already said, it's not enough for miners to believe a mini UASFcoin has value, they have to believe it will hold that value for potentially months before their block rewards become spendable. 
Most people already acknowledge the way alt-coin prices can and do get pumped up on very little trading volume. My assumption is that the people behind BIP148 will definitely try to force up the coins value after the chain splits. But I don't think miners will be dumb enough to pile into a potential pump-and-dump at the expense of the Bitcoin network they have been helping build for many years.

I'm fully aware, and what you just claimed is complete rubbish. SegWit has never been the compromise. Saying "SegWit is the compromise" over and over and over again is not going to make it true. SegWit is functionality that will greatly improve off-chain networks like LN. SegWit's block fudging does happen to give a bit more headroom for transactions, but that doesn't mean it is "the compromise".
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:52:20
I think you're the one missing basic economics. The whole supply vs. demand concept relies on supply being a changeable thing. If supply is fixed and demand keeps increasing then price will sky-rocket.
When talking about the total supply of bitcoins and their price, that sky-rocket is a good thing and will take us to the moon. 
When talking about total transaction capacity and their fees, that sky-rocket is going to blow-up in our faces leaving a bunch of alt-coiners laughing their asses off at the way we threw away our chance to be a global currency.

Arguing against hard-forks for literally years because of the possible *risk* of a chain-split. Arguing that the 75% hash-rate proposed for Bitcoin XT was too low, that the one month grace period was too short, etc etc etc. Then throwing all of that out the window when it doesn't work for your own proposal. 
That sounds like integrity and principals to you? 
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:58:44
This is completely untrue. You BIP148 nodes are going to reject blocks the don't support SegWit transactions. SegWit transactions have never been a part of Bitcoin in the 8 years it has existed. 
The nodes, plus some hopefully minuscule minority of hash power, are the ones who will split the chain. They will be the ones running consensus breaking non-Bitcoin software. And I can only hope the people who push for this "our-way of fuck everybody" policy are never taken seriously in Bitcoin discussions ever again. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:21:40


You're first arguing in favor of pushing some proportion of cryptocurrency usage onto litecoin. A couple of years ago the only people who would advocate for that would be litecoin pumpers. 


If crypto is in such desperate need of a currency that accepts huge fees and massive transaction backlogs to ensure that anyone can run a node on a crappy computer/internet connection - then fine! Blockstream should fork off and create that coin. See how much uptake there is for a coin whose stated goal is tiny transaction throughput but cheap to run nodes. But that is not what Bitcoin was ever intended to be. That's not what drew people into the currency. That's not what we signed up for. 


Your added bonus is just wishful thinking. Gold was used as circulating currency for thousands of years before it was relegated to shiny bars in underground vaults. Bitcoin isn't going to magically jump from new technology to universally trusted store of value without becoming useful as a currency in-between.
