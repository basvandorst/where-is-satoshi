Focus on the Blockchain, one day it could be used to collect taxes, eliminate fraud, hold politicians to the word about campaign financing, auditing etc. The Blockchain has one hell of a chance of disrupting a lot of powerful industries and people.

About 8 dollars a week but with the rising price its been going up a bit, I'm not in it for a huge profit I know I would need an Asic or a few to turn a profit. I just enjoy it and want to do my part for the bitcoin network.

The block eruptors were $15-11 dollars each for 11 of them, there's an Anker USB 3.0 hub with 9 ports and another Anker 4 port hub not pictured.

It happened to me before and I contacted them. They got back to me a few hours later and said it was fixed but I had been trying to withdraw the whole time so the transaction went through. How long has it been? I received the funds after a little while, but I've heard other horror stories from them
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:15:43
Your right it has it on their website when you go to deposit, but the price has went up 10 bucks on Mt. Gox today
@_date: 2013-08-09 02:19:57
Worrying isn't fear so don't worry about my pair lol all the places I've named should be abolished with everything
 they've done in the name of "liberty"
@_date: 2013-09-02 12:15:21
Your right. I read an article on the site the other day that was highly critical of BTC but had false, conflicting info.
@_date: 2013-07-31 16:04:07
3 months is ridiculous, if you use BuyBitcoins to withdraw the funds from Mt. Gox, is it still a 3 month wait time??
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:49:01




Fcking ay good for you.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:44:15
I think I've read the word circle jerk wayyyyy too many times in this thread
@_date: 2013-08-28 09:26:24
I didn't think it had anything to do with taking your own picture 
@_date: 2013-08-26 19:33:52
I believe the people behind Bitcoin will wow the agencies with their knowledge of Bitcoin as well as their knowledge of the regulatory hurdles invovled.
@_date: 2013-08-09 02:24:19
Sad but true, hopefully with a strong community it will never vanish and continue to prosper.
@_date: 2013-07-28 21:30:35
Also does anyone know why the sell price on CB is different than Mt.Gox? I have accounts with both as well as Blockchain but the prices are usually 5-7 USD less on CB. Is it because of the withdrawal problems Mt.Gox is having in the US?

Nice to hear about good customer support after all the shit coming out about Avalon including the statement from Yufi. Congrats on everything working out🎉😁😎💴

I agree, they're mad that it is revolutionizing the way payments are sent and made. My only worry is that the IMF, Federal Reserve, and European Central Bank will find a way to bring it down cause it wasn't  started by them and is fucking with the status quo
@_date: 2013-08-28 02:04:31
They sell them on BTCGuild.com if they're still available, I have two now.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:14:47
Lol noticed that and now its blowing away from it.
@_date: 2013-08-17 22:43:41
@_date: 2013-08-29 02:10:32
Does anyone know if the trail they speak of can be done? With every BTC transaction?
@_date: 2013-09-23 13:21:12
I've been using it for a while now and have had no issues. Sorry about your dilemma. :(
@_date: 2013-08-27 19:31:13
China will probably have the least regulation
