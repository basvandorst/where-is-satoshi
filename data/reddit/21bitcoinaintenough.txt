1. Buy cryptosteel to save it on.
2. Get you bitcoin cash and sell them

Cryptocurrency are the developing force behind it. People have only realised its magnificent value due to bitcoin in my honest opinion but value of bitcoin is the reason.
Together all crypto currency are lead developing and testing this genius code but had it never been cause of money no company would be as deeply involved.
Unless microsoft, google or amazon would use it and spend their research and development money on it. But bitcoin was the proove of the logic that showed it worked.
This link says denmark would like to set international standards for it, after 8years hahaha.

Sell to me. My bitcoin broker is completely sold out. Happens always when the price is nice.
Of course you should wait. Wait to next financial crises. Not far away was 2008-2009 last time not long time to go from now. :D
By then everyone who sold will regret and see themselves as idiots thinking why and what the fud.
