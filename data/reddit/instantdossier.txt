The comment was that Bitcoin is simple, but Lightning is too complex. I was pointing out that there's a lot of moving parts you never see in Bitcoin as a product, just as you'll never see them in a finished payment channel product. The reason most users are encountering this is because the development process is being explained.

As far as performance goes the ECDSA signature cache is a significant factor in processing blocks quickly, you can run bitcoin core with `debug=bench` to see per-block breakdowns as well as global counters of where time is being spent. On a normal node near zero time will be spent on validating transactions before inserting them, for nodes with `blocksonly=1` a vast amount of time will be spent due to the cold signature cache. 
The signature cache is somewhat of a hack though and is very dependent on other participants in the network behaving properly. If anybody wants to they can make blocks which specifically hit or miss the cache in a portion of nodes and take a very long time to propagate as a result. If you want to see the performance of the network under adversarial conditions, the times shown in a non caching node should be part of your threat model.

The default value for this was also increased from `100` to `200`MB in 0.13 which helps significantly.

Who decides what checkpoints are added to the client? It's better not to have anybody dictate additional consensus rules like that, they were added as a crutch to get around excruciatingly slow sync times in 0.3.* which have been resolved by moving to LevelDB for the chain store and to libsecp256k1 for verification. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:46:06
Complexity? Bitcoin _is_ the definition of complexity. 
The system implements a massive scripting language, scores of operates with dubious utility, multiple hash functions, double and single byte opcodes for when there's more than 256 of them in existence. Validating the block chain from genesis involves tens of millions of scripts to be executed, as many ECDSA signatures checked, merkle trees that involve thousands of hashes that all work their way up to the root of the block hash. 
Making a transaction involves multiple hashes in decoding an address, making a standard `SIGHASH_ALL` transaction needs modifying and reconstructing a transaction for every single input, then signing that, then stuffing the signatures back in to make it valid. You might end up doing tens of signatures for a single transaction, hundreds of cryptographic hashes, and this is all once you've found spendable outputs to begin with. 
All of this is complexity, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Here you're hearing about design work before it is published as a working system, which is something you never saw in Bitcoin. Presented as a finished product, there's really nothing outlandish about payment channels, the design is basically nothing in comparison with Bitcoin itself.

Clients using BIP37 SPV wallets see lower bandwidth if the transactions they receive are segwit. They never validate signatures so any bytes used sending this data to them is a complete waste.

Checkpoints haven't been updated in over a year, and won't be updated. There's more verification load after them than before them at this point (140k blocks, the majority of the byte size of the chain).

Bitcoin was originally meant to make high-sigop transactions illegal with a hard limit per block, but due to an implementation mistake the counting of sigops happened in the wrong place and was completely ineffective. This would have been a proxy for a block size limit had it worked. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 00:24:42


Unfortunately SPV as described in the Satoshi paper is  inoperable. 


For a system like this to be secure there needs to be compact fraud proofs, a way of describing how a block is invalid without needing to store a fully validated UTXO (which by definition a SPV node does not have). In the absence of compact fraud proofs, a message that says "block n is invalid" can never be validated as true or false, on receipt of one your only option is to download the entire chain and validate it to be sure. As there is no way for this to be implemented, BIP37 does away with all validation and attempts to simply trust the amount of proof of work and absolute nothing else about a transaction they have received. 
In essence, they trust that a small hand full of miners are both validating blocks and are acting with the interests of their clients in mind- it has been demonstrated by mining pools creating 6 invalid blocks in a row (the normal stated threshold for transaction safety) that this is absolutely not the case even in the complete absence of malice. 
Without decentralization, Bitcoin is rather boring and you'd be best off replacing it with something specifically centralized- it would be significantly faster, more private, and with comforts such as consumer protection. Attempting to make a centralized system out of Bitcoin just gives you the absolute worst of both worlds. The whole attraction of Bitcoin is that we are able to validate that out currency system has integrity using cryptography, we aren't just blindly trusting what other people say.

Script can be removed in a backwards compatible way. You would need to retain execution, or move to a system where old scripts can be spent by proving a form of execution proof, but in actuality there's almost no scripts in use which aren't standard P2PKH or P2SH multisignature transactions.

The new sync method is faster than BitTorrent, the bottleneck is your CPU if you have a connection speed which can support it. ECDSA signatures are compact but unfortunately very slow, even with libsecp256k1 having hand written assembly for verification. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 10:19:08
That's often indicative of a hardware problem, Bitcoin is an extremely effective load test of memory and storage. Multiple failures to sync points strongly to this, though it's hard to say without knowing what errors you're seeing.

The OP is mistaken, the UTXO database has never been stored in memory on any version of Bitcoin Core, though a small portion (100MB until 0.13.0) of it is kept in a write cache. This is easily evidenced by the fact that the UTXO is over 1GB, and a node does not consume this amount of memory while operating.

ASN1 is the encoding format used by openssl for public keys amongst other things. There's essentially no specification, nobody implements the entire thing properly, half of it is devoted to encoding negative numbers, strings, negative numbers and other bullshit which no crypto system uses. There's multiple standards within it which all behave differently for utterly no sensible reason. Worse, OpenSSL doesn't even decode the same keys identically on different systems which is totally incompatible with a consensus system. 
It's not used in Bitcoin anymore.

Earlier this month during the chain fork SPV clients gained 6 fake confirmations on transactions, due to them trusting to do verification of transaction contents they weren't actually doing. &gt; 50% of the network was mining on headers without validation, so the principle behind SPV is completely broken. It is completely unsafe at this point in time to put any trust in the number of confirmations you see in a SPV wallet because there's a very good chance that by malice or accident, these will be fake and undone. It has so far happened twice, with alarmingly long chains being built each time. It's only dumb luck that nobody was stolen from by taking advantage of these incidents. 


You might find this paper on how un-private SPV bloom filtering is very interesting then. It goes into depth about how a group of researchers was able to successfully attack the privacy of numerous clients in the network due to bad assumptions about how private the BIP37 really was. They conclude that there is no privacy to be found at all in SPV bloom filtering, and none of their mitigations suggested have been implemented in clients like BitcoinJ so far.

This gives 3000 verifications a second for a high end core i7, quad core CPU with hyperthreading. Most transactions in the Bitcoin network have at least two signatures to verify, many have [20 or more]( The Bitcoin network can not sustain 3000 transactions a second based on CPU usage of ECDSA signature verification alone. This also does not account for actually catching up with the chain, just keeping up with it once you have.

You have of course just removed the ability of any single person running a node, and condemned everybody to use SPV clients with atrocious security and privacy.

Is there any evidence that they need to exist, however? Bitcoin already has smart contracts, without the hand waving and wishy thinking. The poster child DAO use case for Ethereum fell pretty quickly. If the system is so in demand, desired, craved, there must surely be a reason for its existence.

It begs the question what a "web browser equivalent" of a scripting language is supposed to be. It takes a lot of focused, wishy thinking to believe that this sort of nonsense can actually exist. Remember that the Ethereum developers have already admitted that the Ethereum EVM is completely unsafe, misguided, and are currently busy writing [its replacement]( If you believe it to really be the foundation of "currency 2.0", you might want to hold off for a bit.

A million people using Bitcoin is unlikely, to the degree of someone bringing out a radioisotope hairdryer for the consumer market. The system has hard caps on how fast the network can operate while maintaining decentralization, you can't get around simple limits such as ECDSA signature verification. If this is really why Brian Armstrong has been chaperoning the "big blocks" movement with this misguided vision in his head, there's some hard realities to be learned there.

Mining with different consensus rules means the security assumptions of SPV, that people won't make invalid blocks, is broken. It is no longer safe to use non-validating SPV wallets like Bread as these miners will happily extend invalid chains and wallets have no way of knowing that this has happened. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:11:27

There's always been a block limit of 32MB implied by the p2p protocol.
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:15:04
It basically means that they will mine on top of invalid blocks. The security assumption of SPV (that miners will validate blocks) is broken, no SPV wallets are safe.

How does anyone collect money from segwit?
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:26:06
They're invalid blocks Bitcoin Unlimited nodes will accept if they are under proof of work weight. This means I can make a chain of say, 2 invalid blocks, and Bitcoin Unlimited miners will continue to extend them blindly. This is a broken security assumption for SPV validation, who assume that all miners are validating.

You're right, they're just in blockchain.info's database and nowhere else. They removed this feature recently anyway.

You only need 33% of blocks to censor other miners, 51% is old school.

No, an address is the hash of a public key. You expose it when you spend, not before. The time between you exposing your public key and it being too deep for anyone to double spent is only a couple of hours. If you use a new address every time rather than reusing them, you are at least somewhat quantum safe. 
Most of the outputs of the first hundred thousand or so blocks are raw pubkeys though, their continued unspentness is good evidence that there's no general quantum computer (or it's in the hands of someone who can resist taking $3B USD worth of BTC).
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:09:32


@_date: 2016-10-17 11:23:20
With all P2SH addresses you made a script, stored it, and then made a hash of it, then asked someone to send money to it. You can search for matches of this hash same as you would a normal address where you made a pubkey, hashed it, and asked someone to send money to it. Even in a non pruned node there is no situation where you ever need to go back and look at blocks other than if you are rescanning an old wallet. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 03:50:32


I don't understand why you think it's inevitable, there's almost no changes that would require a hard fork other than changing the proof of work. Name a change that **needs** a hard fork other than that. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:34:33
Except for you know, the block size bit. That's a consensus rule, and has always been enforced by Bitcoin, even in its first release. 
You can't pick and choose which bits you'd like to validate, that's what makes people creating alternate implementations of Bitcoin so difficult! All of the rules need to be followed, even ones which are implicit or non obvious. If you don't follow all the rules you risk being forked off the chain, or even worse having your money stolen by getting coerced into accepting payments in blocks which other people consider to be invalid. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:10:19
Yes, but only in P2SH transactions, so only the hash of them. 28 bytes.

It's disingenuous to call them a "pool", it's a single actor with a huge hashrate. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:25:46
Yes, if there exists a real quantum computer than ECDSA is broken. Bitcoin itself isn't vulnerable, but addresses that have exposed their public keys can be cracked with significantly lower complexity than currently. Bitcoin can be extended to use quantum safe cryptography and continue as normal, but its generally less interesting than classical stuff. 
Fortunately, no quantum computers exist today. The often quoted dwave company can't produce anything capable of running the sort of tools you would need to break ECDSA.

You have to intentionally make a transaction that's invalid one one chain and not the other, there's no tools for doing this and it's not a realistic occurrence. You would need exchanges that can differentiate between one transaction type and another, and they struggle to keep money in one wallet in the best of situations.

That's how the system works, everyone in the economy validates transactions (either directly, or by a proxy) to make sure the inflation control and security is kept in check. If we end up in a situation where the majority of the economy aren't validating, we have a big big problem. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:45:20


Well they don't quite, they don't have the patience to keep rebasing patches on top of their set so they've fallen far behind Core in terms of performance and security releases. They're somewhere around 12.0 I believe. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:16:15
Nodes control the network, not miners. Miners can make any invalid shit, and my node won't accept it.
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:40:20
It's simpler than that. Do you trust the people who have been working on the performance of Bitcoin Core for years and know it inside out, or hacks that think that things are as simple as just ripping out validation rules and everything will be fine? If people have spent years working on protecting a piece of software they're not going to stick around if people truly fuck them over by going against all the best advice in the world. 
There's zero technical merit behind the agenda being pushed by Bitcoin Unlimited, and it shows by the brute force nature they are using, Ver is surely spending millions trying to get this through the door versus a disconnected group of coders on IRC.

Yep, it's manipulative as hell. 
Same reason Bitcoin classic versions are 1.1, to make it look "more upgraded" than Bitcoin Core at 0.13 (even though they are far far behind). Bitcoin Classic 0.12.1 wasn't even based off Core 0.12.1, it was just named that way to pretend they kept up with the rebasing of security patches from upstream.

That's not how the real world works. People will set their nodes to either the default, or the maximum in fear of being "left behind". The limit is therefor either controlled by the developers, or non existent. The control loop doesn't exist basically. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:27:34
Miners made 6 invalid blocks in a row after the BIP66 activation. If you just trusted them, you'd have accepted those blocks which completely broke the rules of the network. The security of the network is based around the *longest valid chain*, not the chain that has the most proof of work behind it. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:46:30
Everyone would reject them, as intended, as this is invalid.
