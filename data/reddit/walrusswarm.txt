I am happy to see that this tutorial included a simple firewall. However I would strongly advise that adding Fail2Ban and/or disabling SSH completely to keep these nodes secure. The security of the lightning network is at stake please take this seriously.  
  
Edit: typos

Cost price averaging is a mathematical way which in principal may allow you to spend out of a hole and break even sooner.   
**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice. Doing so would be a HUGE gamble. You would take on a lot more risk that would ride on the assumption that this is the bottom. Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose.   
   
  
Also something that might help you look on the bright side.

I think that what you’ve added is great and it is under an appropriate section title. Also, I like that you demonstrated how fail2ban works. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:53:59


Disabling SSH is possible. The Pi has an HDMI port and a USB port. You don't need to SSH if you have physical access to the machine.  


I think that it is essential because of the nature of the device, its exposure to the internet, and the potential reward associated with compromising the device.  
  
All precautions should be taken. I can imagine the bad PR that bitcoin is going to get if some blogger can legitimately post a clickbait title exclaiming that the lightning network was hacked.  
I would also recommend asking questions over at for suggestions regarding best practices for your project.

I’m just learning about the lightning network and I’m trying to decide how much BTC to put in my lightning wallet.  
  
Is the diagram saying that a lightning transaction of 0.1BTC can be supplied by 4 lightning nodes if each contains 0.025BTC?
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:11:33
Hey, I thought I should follow up because I’m tinkering around with Raspiblitz and it does put a swap file onto the external drive where the blockchain is stored. So whatever drive is attached would sustain additional writes which could cause a flash memory failure.

Damn, sorry you’re having trouble. They do need to get it together for iOS. I like my Yubikey for non-mobile purposes. I would like to see more browser support.  
The Ledger Nano S is a U2F device. Does that work with iOS? I haven’t tried, 
  
With respect to price. Don’t forget that they recommend having two just in case.   
Also with respect to price. Why are you buying a Yubikey Neo ($30-40) for use with U2F when you can buy the Yubikey FIDO U2F for $18

So I guess they’re slowly implementing the NFC for the iPhone which is a surprise to me. It looks like OTP works with NFC but no U2F. That is pretty lame they should make that clear on their product specifications.  
  
This blog post seems to explain why U2F doesn’t really work with iPhone.

Based on the above link, it looks like the issue is with Apple write permissions. Maybe we should be mad at Apple.   
On that note Android is fine. With all of your talk about throwaway accounts and burner devices. Why don’t you pick up a burner android device? It’s a hassle and t sucks but it might be your only option for a workaround.

I’m done with Coinbase and ready to move. Not selling or trading just moving everything to long term segwit Ledger Nano S storage. 
What are some segwit exchanges that I should check out? The most recommended exchange I see here is Gemini. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:55:49
Would you mind providing the link the tutorial you followed? I want to see if I can make a docker file for the raspberry pi from the tutorial.  
  
Edit: is this the tutorial you used?  
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:39:57
You can try CPFP (child pays for parent). I didn’t care to go that route because I was transferring from Breadwallet to a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:35:40
Yes. I just had this happen. After 2 weeks your receiving address will not show the pending transaction. The funds will be returned to the sending address. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:21:56
I’m not sure about breadwallet. I believe that they intend to support segwit. Personally if I were making a transfer during these days of ultra high fees I would transfer to a Ledger Nano S they support Segwit for sure. I don’t think I can use it with my phone yet though.

Running a full node is not very CPU intensive. For example a full node can be run on a Raspberry Pi, or a low power virtual machine. Mainly a full node takes up disk space and eats through your monthly data cap. *However the amount of data used can be limited/configured.  
  
Think of it like charity for the network. But also it secures the network. Read about a 51% attack is and how it works. Running a full node makes it more difficult for that sort of attack.  
  
Based on your comments, running a full node probably isn’t for you. It’s a fun project if you have some computer parts lying around. Heck, you might even learn something. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:16:53
I’m glad to see that this tutorial included fail2ban.  
I would like to add. If you’re using a RPi3/3+ (and an operating system that is based on Raspbian), you can flash the image to a USB and boot without a microSD card.  
*Some external HDD’s are bootable too. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 21:02:19
I agree, it’s not a charity. Rather, it’s a donation of time, hardware, and electricity to the greater good of the bitcoin network. I couldn’t think of a good simile for someone who is clearly in it for the money. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 18:23:30
There is no return on running a full node with bitcoin. Running a node helps secure the bitcoin network and its a fun project. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:54:39
I think that’s a solid comparison.

@_date: 2018-10-27 20:12:31
Yes this is a benefit of bitcoin. Check out the service fees for sending money using a service like Western Union. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:35:18
Yes, move along and please start using Bitcoin like a currency. Buy things, sell things and move money with low transaction fees as intended. Your lambo dreams are dead.

~~People running raspiblitz 1.2 are on 0.6 upgraded. 1.3 is a pre-release at the moment.~~  
  
EDIT: As of 21 hours ago RaspiBlitz is Version 1.3 with lnd 0.7.1-beta and bitcoin 0.18.1

Can I get a tutorial? New to lightning, I have a lightning wallet/node. Where do I connect? How do I connect my username to collect all of these tips?
@_date: 2019-08-16 03:24:01
Top 3 alternatives. Go. (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:28:49
Nope, I didn’t find any help here or elsewhere. Casa wants you to buy their product and use their software. The claim that their software is open source and you can run it on your hardware is a farce.  
  
Raspiblitz has tor and it’s a good option that can be set up with minimal terminal experience. The WebUI could be improved but it gets the job done.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:58:12
That’s not what the paragraph intends to say. They’re saying “you should just pull our pre built containers instead of building them yourself”. Supporting evidence is that they don’t provide a dockerfile so they make it even more difficult to build your own container.
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:27:39
So I can run a node from home just by forwarding the correct ports?
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:42:30
A 400gb SD is a terrible idea. You need a USB HDD.  
  
SD cards like all solid state memory wear out. The 1’s and 0’s get stuck, that part of the memory becomes locked and the usable size of the card/chip shrinks.
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:22:46
Personally I have worn out 3 Samsung Evo MicroSD cards. I thought they were quality. I have also worn out two Lexar USB3.0 drives. I still have them, the data is there and you can’t format or erase the drive.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:44:37
It takes some modifications to the configuration files and enabling swap to make the program think there is more RAM than there is. Last I checked bitcoin core requires 2GB RAM to work without those modifications.
@_date: 2019-08-16 03:12:38
You carry around a ledger x? Are you spending bitcoin regularly in person?

@_date: 2019-06-26 02:11:43
I found their github page. It does have dockerfiles when you dig through their repo...  
I might try those projects. But I want to start with something user friendly before I dig deeper.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:05:36
You’re right. Write processes like swap are a larger issue for flash memory. And I can’t really explain the two lexar usb drives. I was using them in school at the library because I didn’t have a laptop. Maybe something else failed.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:00:44
How does it take the ID? Barcode or Photo?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:58:45
Thank you, I’ve seen those and I appreciate the recommendation of raspiblitz. I am interested in the Casa Lightning Node specifically.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:32:38
That’s what I’m looking at using!
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:18:06
Yeah I saw that. I’m more than familiar with docker but there aren’t any instructions. Do I need to pull and spin up all of their containers? If that’s true why don’t they just have a docker-compose file.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:19:41
They’ve been financially wounded after buying at 19K. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:21:09
So many questions about both.  
  
Which does the network need more? Lightning or bitcoin nodes?  
  
How much data/month does a bitcoin/lightning node use?  
  
Are lightning nodes used by the public? Or are they for direct private payment? Or both?

Why run the node 24/7?  
Run your node during different hours while you’re not using the internet.  
2am-4pm M-F sleeping + while you’re at work.  
2am-9am Sat-Sun while you’re sleeping.  
  
Even more complicated, write a script to edit your config file and change the speed and number of connections based on your hours of use.   
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:18:22
Many types of coins can be stored on the same ledger. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:33:40
Okay cool that makes sense. 
Have you tried using Quality of Service (QoS) on your router? With QoS you can prioritize or de-prioritize packets from specific services or specific devices on your network. Just something to look into.  
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:15:41
Coinbase is not blocked. I do see that slushpool is. Sorry.  
This is an open source project the problem you’re having is with the maintainer of that block list. Not Pi-Hole. Here is your course of action.  
Step 1. Add the blocked domain to your Whitelist.  
Step 2. Post on to raise awareness. They can add bitcoin domains to the list of Conmonly Whitelisted Domains   
  
Step 3. Open a ticket with the maintainer of the block list on their github page.  
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:03:08
I’ve been looking for an excuse to get one too. 
Check out this new e-paper display that can display yellow. That would be perfect for bitcoin.   
It would be cool to just display the Bitcoin logo and your public key. The great thing about e-paper is that the screen lasts with zero power.  
  
I wish I had a CS background and could contribute. I’ll be proud of myself if I can complete your tutorial. Don’t forget to make a cross post to @_date: 2018-03-27 03:46:44
Wow that’s a long tutorial. Thanks for your hard work. I hope someone builds on your work so we can have more gadgets. I think an e-paper display would be a nice addition.

You might have better luck with dogecoin. It’s kind of their thing. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:03:49
Using anything with a free power source makes sense.  
  
Monro would probably be more profitable. Maybe he was using Nicehash to mine Monero and getting paid in BTC.  
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:28:40
Do any of them have a decent exchange rate? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:12:33
This could be negotiated more fairly in a contract. 
Instead of paying $500 USD worth of BTC/week. Employers should pay 0.05BTC/week. With a minimum USD value of $500 USD/week. Value is determined every Friday at 5PM.  
I believe that minimum wage laws could apply here. If the value of the payment at the time of payment drops below the minimum wage, then employers might be in trouble. This would be an interesting legal discussion which may result in a federal court ruling.  
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:25:46
How much data does a Pi node use? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:46:09
But 1 coin at 16K.  
Buy 2 more coins at 8K.  
Break even when the price hit $10.7K  
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:31:41
The price of Bitcoin is so speculative that opinion means more than facts.  
  
Shouting and arguing that this is a bull run is a self fulfilling prophecy as long as news organizations pick it up and agree.   
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:51:42
I can totally understand getting riled up over that.   
You can export and restore your lists using the teleporter tool from the admin page. Click settings and then the top right where is says teleporter.  
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:01:57
~~This is false. You are sounding the alarm with false claims.~~  
~~I use the PiHole adblocker and I have access to those domains. I just checked. ~~  
If you have a problem setting up your Pi-Hole or misconfigured your own setup post it on The developers and community there are friendly. Maybe I’ll see you there and help you myself.  
Being an open source project the PiHole is 100% configurable. PiHole does pull from specific blocklists by default these lists are not maintained by the PiHole developers. The developers have made it very easy to enable, disable, or add custom block lists to your unique PiHole.   
  
Have a nice day!

The reward doesn’t mean anything if the coin is worthless. Such a system would require its own exchange. SETI could/should ask for grants in bitcoin to reward miners. With government agencies having already seized bitcoin assets and accepting taxes in bitcoin this would be 100% feasible.  
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:33:33
I don’t know one person IRL wants to accept bitcoin largely because the price isn’t stable. And I don’t want to spent because next week it might moon lol.  
  
I understand that regular currency isn’t stable. But it’s more stable than bitcoin. My grocery bill does change but we’re taking +-5% weekly.

A traditional wallet often costs more than the sum of its contents. I have a $30 wallet with $15 in cash and a few plastic rectangles that I can render useless with 3 phone calls.  
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:39:37
I thought that you would be able to use wildcarding to whitelist domains. Looks like that’s not possible yet.  
  
The fastest solution is to disable that blacklist while you work on it. 
Looks like there is a script in the comments for finding domains and whitelisting them a lot faster 
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:44:42
You can cash out and get cash? Or is it like a direct deposit? Or some sort of loaded Visa card?

If you keep it in a waterproof bag/container that’s inside a fireproof safe.

For a different Raspberry Pi project I shucked a 2.5” 1TB usb HDD and it works great. No additional power input required.
