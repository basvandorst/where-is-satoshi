Could someone explain this like i'm 5?

If it would be a legality issue to issue shares, would it be able to issue bonds instead?

Owner of bitstock.org and front-end web developer here, if you guys are interested in a website developed i'd be more than happy to contribute.

There is no such thing as perfect software security - therefore all security is inherently false security. There are however prevention security measures that can *decrease* chances of successful attacks.
If you only want to look for faults and no solutions then i'm not sure why you are here.

I'm a beginning front-end developer - that does not mean i work with encryption or that i'm dealing with other people's money, or that i develop encryption schemes from scratch. I would not risk doing so without a proper background, which is why i'm presenting this idea for discussion.
Otherwise i'm not sure why this is about me and not about looking for solutions for this problem.

While i understand you concern, would you kindly refrain from quick judgement of others?
@_date: 2013-07-29 07:15:08
Perhaps the solution i'm looking for is not exactly protection in a perfect sense, since any local attack would always be able to access data etc - but in a sense of trying of taking **advantage** that a keylogger must have a limited amount of adaptation/size/complexity that it can have before becoming detected.
One way of seeing this is that what we need is not perfect security/protection - but random enough obfuscation that would *render the keylogger obsolete or at least more noticeable*.

Another way of looking at this issue is that there is no such thing as *perfect malware*. While it's true that any malware could be made to crack a safe, the *creator* of that malware must know *how the safe works*.
What we need is a system that would require such *extensive* adaptation from the malware's part to access the data, that it would render it too large/complex to not become detected.
Another idea would be having a system that randomizes it's own input structure which would require the malware to take considerable possibilities of instructions to access the data.

My main question would be why we can't have a Lambert upgrade now and not in the future?

I'm not sure what happened with you and these "people" but if you want i'm more than happy to contribute with anything i can.

Let's say i'm a coffee shop owner and i would like to sell shares of my company. Would there be a legality issue? Would i be able to do that with colored coins in the near/far future?
If so - let's assume the client is workable - what are the specific and concise steps i would need to make (eli5) to sell my shares? Can i provide dividends?
Would there be needed an indexing site as well? Or would i only need to use the blockchain?
Main question would be - since i'm selling shares how would trust be minimized? If this would be a legality issue would this be more appropriate therefore as a form of an electronic bond? I would see creating electronic shares would create a trust issue, since a way to prove ownership must be created, thus a need for a central authority.

I would imagine it would have to have a public &amp; private version of a hash tower, wearas while you cannot mine from the public hash tower, you can monitor the amount of stocks that is made by the company.

Are you sure? What about having a virtual mini-server that would contain the wallet.dat and decrypt it on it's own?
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:17:43
Are there any places like this in other cities?
@_date: 2013-07-29 08:21:19
I think there has been a misunderstanding - i do not have the background knowledge or intention to be able to develop such an obfuscation/security scheme, which is why i'm here to discuss if any other back-end developers are interested in developing this.

So, this is basically a Bitcoin IOU? O.o
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:00:10
What do you think of the Bitshare/Bitstock?
As in applying the bitcoin concept on stock shares? 
( Basically a de-centralized bitcoin version of the stockmarket)
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:11:05
The basic distinction is that this is a sister-system of bitcoin, whereas instead of replacing fiat currencies, it replaces the stock exchange, making any type of business no matter how small, to be able to sell their own stocks.
This would also inherently give Bitcoin the ability to *directly* buy Companies/Shares, something which we do not have right now.
In regards to our current Stock Market, when you buy your stock - ETFS for ex - it is usually your bank that actually buys the stock for you, but more importantly in order to open a Ticker/Stock of your own, there are many many restrictions that take place, which leaves out most small business out of the grid.

Is it possible to create a p2p decentralized cloud sharing system that basically has each user share a small amount of storage space - similar to freenet - but simply for storage?
It would need an upfront storage cache in the beginning and i'm guessing each client would have a portion of magnet links and seed links.
For example: i upload a 100mb file, i start seeding my file within designated lineup of leechers within the system. Thus new seeders that have more leechers and old seeders have less leechers. 
Another thing to note is that providing storage space for others has an incentive: the more designated space you give for other clients, the more individual seeders - which also means more individual leechers as well - the more designated space you can also have available. 
One interesting thing is that this system is also flexible to allow git repositories and git management tools as well.
I'm not sure why we don't have this already...

...um...if this is true, why would we need a public blockchain at all then?

Does this mean that these Contracts are basically a form of protocol that could be used for BitStock? Or is it an alternative? 
Alternatively is it's possible to make this into a more "usable" form for the general public?
