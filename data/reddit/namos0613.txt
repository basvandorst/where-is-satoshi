Guy from MN here, indeed, it sucks. My dad uses coinbase because I told him to invest.

Is kryptex any good? What are some user friendly nicehash alternatives

Are there any white hats willing to hack the hacker? People have found his bitcoin wallet online. Why hasn't someone done this

Please educate yourself, a hardware wallet would have done nothing, I hadn't payed out, as nicehash does it automatically every week if you have 0.001 btc.

I'm fucking using fucking nice hash on a fucking Nvidia 1060 with fucking 3gb of fucking VRAM. I'm also fucking using a fucking i5 fucking 6600k fucking overclocked to fucking 4.8 fucking GHz. I fucking just fucking started mining sweet fucking bitcoin a fucking week or two ago. All the fucking sudden today as I was fucking checking my fucking balance I fucking noticed there was a fucking connection error. I was all like "What the FUCK?!?". So I fucking restarted the fucking program and all the fucking sudden all my fucking sweet bitcoin was gone. So I was like "DOUBLE WHAT THE FUCK!!!". It fucking still hasn't fucking corrected itself and I'm this fucking close to fucking smashing my fucking fist through the fucking sweet fucking tempered glass. You guys better have a fucking solution to this, cause my fucking ADHD infested brain can't handle this shot for much longer. Fuck.
