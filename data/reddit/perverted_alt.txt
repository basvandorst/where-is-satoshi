Even that were as true, it's a farce of a comparison.
You act like the money IS THE GOVERNMENT'S and they are deciding between giving it to the rich or the poor.  That's absurd.


Means the government is giving people money *IT DOESN'T HAVE*


Means *TAKING LESS* from people.
You act like if a "benefit" was reduced and resulted in a "tax cut" for someone wealthy that means the wealthy person is taking money from the poor person.  That's silly and misleading.
If I take $10 out of your wallet because I want some of your money and then I give you $1 change back, how stupid would someone have to be to act like you are guilty of taking $1 from me? lol

LOL.  you need a gun *now*.  You're definitely going to need one then.

lmfao.  Please inspect my post history more and make fun of it while lecturing me on how to find common interests with people.
**"*Omg you disagree with my fiscal politics.  I hate every single thing about you now!  Why can't you just get along and focus on what we all have in common?*"**
You're a joke.  Seriously.  The fucking irony. lol
Fuck off.

Precisely.  The moment they learn than "closing the gun show loophole" means a gun registration they immediately withdraw their support.  The devil is in the details.

Awww, that's sad.

Wtf are you even talking about?  Nevermind don't answer.
Literally everything you write is just maximum cringe.

Btw, it's obvious that you're not from the United States and your constant commentary is just SAD.
Nobody fucking cares what you think about the US.  I don't know if you're from France or Germany or Brazil or whothefuckcares where.
Your opinion on our politics means precisely dick.
I'm sure you think you are an expert on US economics and politics and social issues.
So go jerk off looking in the mirror.  Nobody gives a fuck.
  **I'm going to block you and it will be like you never existed.**

In a desert.
Most places have streams, rivers, wells, and it rains quite a bit.
I'm not suggesting you should stockpile weapons.  AT ALL.
I'm suggesting it's silly to suggest you don't need a gun at all or that a gun is going to be useless.
They aren't useless now.  So they definitely won't be then.
Even if you are a die-hard gun control zealot......assume you never get to pass your gun control legislation.  You want to be the only person without one??
Anyway....yeah have some water too. lol   And some food.  And some gasoline.  And and and....

Until they learn that the only way that works is with a gun registration.  Then they immediately withdraw their support.
@_date: 2018-11-14 09:01:37
Yeah, nobody with a gun will ever kill you unless you have one too. /s

You hope.  No SSI is best case scenario.  You'll have your earnings in your old age if you are still working and any other savings.
Worse would be if they make good on SSI payments with devalued currency.  Then not only will your SSI payment be gone, but your income won't be good and your other savings will be gone.

Gosh you seem really smart
@_date: 2018-11-14 09:22:37






Oh, thanks for the lesson on cognitive dissonance.
I disagreed with your fiscal politics.  So you attacked me *personally*.   And then you had the balls to pretend like I am the one who attacked you personally.


Not really.  Because you don't exist in about 30 seconds..  I'm literally DELETING YOU from my existence.  You never existed.  You're not even an abortion.

3 is a lot.  It's very situational.  Am I just protecting my family and property from a future with extremely high crime due to poverty, etc?
In that case I'd say the percentage of winning any number of "gun battles" as you put it would be very high.
However, if you're thinking of some MadMax type of nonsense where I drive across the wasteland shooting it out with raiders for the last scrap of food....ummm, pretty low.
But still better than if unarmed.
A gun is a tool.  
Obviously you buy a tool like a saw if you have a particular project in mind for that saw.....but it's not like you would ONLY buy a saw for a specific project.  It's generally considered just something you might need.  
Maybe there is a famine and you're going to hunt.  Maybe there is crime and you have to defend your family.  Maybe it is actually MadMax and you do have to go to war with raiders in the wasteland.  Maybe the next genocidal government is yours and you have to fight back in a revolution or civil war.  Maybe absolutely nothing bad happens and you just shoot some targets and your kids inherit these tools that hold their value extremely well.  What's the downside?
