who are you to give advice?
@_date: 2017-01-23 11:50:13
the correct answer: that's not your business. get lost.

should I use `"averages": { "day": NNN .. }` from their rest api as the exchange rate between usd and btc and it'll be the one I specify in an invoice? Or `"last": NNN"`?

where can I see it?
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:57:50
I know. but read what I've written above.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:22:22
what's that?
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:26:46
maybe. but Electrum, for example, would consider that address free, hence when I create a new payment request for other client, Electrum might well use that same address.  
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:22:40
ok. what's a workaround?
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:36:49
do you even understand what I asked you? 




how would I not confuse the old client, who paid late, with a new one, who paid on time? both to the same addresses, possibly even at the same time. I mean, in a automatic fashion.

@_date: 2017-01-24 19:34:49
that's right. you're nothing to give advice not related to my question.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:58:37
how can I verify that in Electrum or in my own blockchain?
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:06:07
explain why.
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:39:34


And? Why would it? Electrum just gives me an address a client will have to pay to. Once a client has paid, it'll be broadcasted to blockchain. Not sooner than that. I see no problem with that. And you?
