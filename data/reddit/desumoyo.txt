Yeah, vulnerabilities exist in open source software, what I'm worried on closed source encryption software, is backdoor added by the company itself.

Because I'm unable to read on a screen, apparently, my bad!

Well, yeah, but he didn't come with the "without the financial component" part by himself, and if it happened, it would has been corrected.
What I guess was your major problem with it.

IBM ? yeah total noobs, they done nothing, well exept their own computer, the PC (Based on an x86 arch by Intel), you may have heard of it,

If you want software without any possibility of vulnerability, then you're searching a unicorn.
Heartbleed is known, Bash problem is known, how many backdoor your closed source phone baseband, your router (if closed source) have is unknown, and there is no way to know.

Netflix is the most popular VOD platform, DVD is dead. Blockbuster is dead.
Uber is replacing taxis, even if taxis try to lobbies governements about this, they didn't succeded at all.
Except if you're a fanboy, laugh if you want, but where is Windows Mobile today (See the ballmer video up to your post)? And what market share does Windows Phones has?
Facebook still has tons of users and tons of data to sell, they aren't dying anytime soon.
So i'd say that it's a good point for the BTC.
PS: I don't have a facebook account, I use an Android phone, I never use taxi or uber services and blockbuster never existed over here, please try to call me a fanboy for the lulz...

IBM clones were not made by IBM, but they are called IBM PC for a reason. I taken this exemple because this is the one that will speak the most for everyone.
Also, hint : Macintosh today are IBM PC Compatible, What a failure!
EDIT : Also, Macintosh CPU before that was PowerPC, made by IBM (The G5 one, the G4 was made by Motorola)

Your site is obviousely broken, Because I'm Satoshi Nakamoto, but you can't prove it !

Yeah, true. Today they are working on [Watson]( and some of the most efficient [supercomputer](

Well, trusting a closed source encryption system, No matter if it's Apple or anyone else, is pretty stupid.
Beside, Apple isn't the best with security, they take a f*cking long time to do security updates.

Well, yet, all those companies is making a lot of money, they are really really successfull, and their concurrent died/is dying.
When a company laugh at a concurrent, it mean they doesn't take the concurrent seriousely. if the concurrent product fail, everything is fine for them... however if it succeed, it mean that they planned absolutely nothing to reply. Microsoft/Apple mobile OS is the best proof of that you could find. Microsoft was so sure that Apple was gonna fail with the iPhone that they changed NOTHING to Windows Mobile, and Microsoft dissapeared from the phones market during long years.
Yeah, Android has bigger market share today, but let's not forget that Android phone prototype was originally looking like that:  , If google didn't transformed it to be closer of public expectation after iPhones, I'm sure it would has been dead today.

Especially because bitcoin is here to stay, grandma however have "an expiration date" to say it nicely.
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:40:04


You mean don't do like yourself?
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:02:14


Because this is an exellent idea and what all modern OS does.
The only difference is that Windows have way more shitty apps that will always ask for unnecesarry admin right, the UAC prompt is nothing more than the "sudo" prompt you can get on linux/OSX

Hey everyone look! it's the idiot who tried to enforce a blacklist on the bitcoin client!
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:32:32
Go fuck yourself.
(Seriousely, look at this guy history and tell me how credible he is?)
