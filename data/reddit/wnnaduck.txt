This looks great

Why does it matter, whether you found out someone stole your BTC one second after or 1 month after it happened it’s the same thing, you can’t get it back. A hardware solution is better as it will prevent that theft in the first place.

Things like the ledger nano s use a secure element to store all your keys, this is just like the secure element that’s used in the iPhone, same type of technology. 
The only difference is now my bitcoins are separated and kept on a totally different device (ledger). So it’s the same kind of technology pretty much if we’re talking protection of your keys, plus the ledger offers plausible deniability with the ability to create 2 wallets incase you ever had a gun to your head. It’s more likely that I will lose my phone than lose a flash drive sized item that’s stashed away deep in my house.
This is like saying you would rather keep 100K in cash in your pocket rather then keep it underneath your floorboards in your house, yes you would know it’s gone faster if it were kept on you, but the chance of it getting stolen is way higher being on you all the time than it is being stashed deeply hidden in a house.

How so? Gemini has worked wonders for me with wonderful support and batch transactions so absolutely 0 transaction fees. How are they “no better” ?
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:12:24
Maybe recently as they’ve started to get overloaded, but they’ve been damn near perfect to me in the past 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:51:24
Just because they are the most popular, doesn’t mean they are the best. They are just the easiest to use and the most popular because of its simplicity. 
Think of it like comparing smoking cigarettes (Coinbase) to smoking marijuana (Gemini). Cigarettes are the most popular, doesn’t mean it’s the better for your health.

Ah I actually wasn’t aware of this, I deserved those downvotes lol my mistake. Thanks for saying this
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:08:11
After coinbase fucked me over and stole my money I moved to Gemini, it was a learning curve I had to go thru but after 20 minutes I had my bearings 
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:01:03
Not with these kind of transaction fees lol
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:07:29
Transaction fees are mining fees, they are the same thing. So no there are 0 fees.

Coinbase WAS the best, it was cheap, simple to use, and pretty much perfect. But recently they’ve gotten expensive, the CEO has clearly stated he pretty much hates bitcoin and they’ve been the slowest to implement the lighting network. GDAX is better but still not perfect as it’s backed by the same crazy people over at Coinbase. 
Gemini is not rocket science, yes it’s different and it may take a learning curve but that’s with anything. They also have a team that actually cares for bitcoin and support batch withdraws and the ability to trade right when you want and you don’t have to wait a couple days for a deposit to come through, it’s just overall a better system.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:11:25
Yes, yes they did. Then they also took $30 from you in transaction fees every time you made a transaction with them, congrats.

Gemini/Binance for alts
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:46:08
Yeah use Gemini, I’ve been using them for months and have never looked back
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:01:11
Gemini does batch withdrawals, if you don’t know what that is, when users withdraw bitcoin from their account, it will be packaged in with other withdrawals on the network. This means that Gemini will cover the transaction fee and that one transaction fee will cover maybe 20 or 30 withdrawals. Making transaction fees non existent for Gemini users. 
So does this help the Blockchain bloat? kinda. But it definitely does make it easier for users to be able to send bitcoin without having to pay a $30 transaction fee.

The ledger in my opinion is better, it uses a secure element to store your keys and has support for more coins. It is also more robust and compact. I own a ledger nano s myself and have never looked back :)
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:12:44
Np :)
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:21:10
No not yet, but they do support batch withdrawals, so you won’t have to worry about paying high fees to move your btc. They are implementing the lighting network soon.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:04:50
Is paying $30+ in transaction fees worth a little extra “simplicity”?  I think not.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:08:41
Yea but Gemini isn’t backed by Brian Armstrong, thus making it better :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:47:50
when compared to cigarettes it really is ;)
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:22:24
Gemini all the way
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:56:19
Gemini for BTC/ETH, Bittrex or Binance for alts. 100% done.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:44:21
I’ve used Gemini for awhile and it’s nothing less than perfect, right now people are unable to get verified because of the sudden influx of the noobs coming into crypto, your day will come tho, just keep waiting :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:34:47
Yea just bitcoin and ether, I buy my bitcoin from Gemini then transfer it to Binance to buy altcoins

@_date: 2018-01-13 01:11:48
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:49:39
They’re probably backlogged now because of all the newbies getting into crypto, don’t worry they’ll get around to you. All exchanges are like this right now.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:32:48
Just use Gemini man, Coinbase is a joke of an exchange
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:02:22
No transaction fees at all. Gemini does batch withdrawals for users so nobody pays a dime for transferring btc out of Gemini.
