What a great read! I've been in crypto for just around 3 months now, do you really think it is a good option to margin/day trade? 
How can I get my mindset out of the HODL strategy and begin more of a high risk, high reward concept?

Same, while my brother and other friends were sweating, I actually had a smile on my face, just wondering what was going to happen next. Great learning experience, as you pointed out. 
Happy Hodling!!!

I saw that... very weird, to say the least. 
Let's hear the speculations

I'm sure you know from doing research for a year, but I will still reiterate it, buy a cold storage wallet like a Ledger or Trezor. Keeping it on whatever exchange you bought from is pretty much current banking right now and if you really want to protect and preserve your investment, you know a cold wallet is the right way.
