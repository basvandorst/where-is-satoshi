when the mempool is filled to the brim and fees are poppin and not just spam and empty spam and empty than maybe there would be a point but now look at bch they tested 32mb and it only cost like 600 in fees so it is easy to fill it up with spam

@_date: 2019-04-25 14:02:11
current 1 hour block time is ~87 sats a byte, you paid 1 sat per byte, 11 would be 8 hours, you should expect about 24 hours if at all

satoshis coins are going to be technologies ultimate jackpot
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:48:56
their solution to scaling is just removing the blocksize cap which doesn't take into account anything most specifically how cheap it is to fill up blocks and create a blockchain too large to store and validate which then becomes centralized
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:30:37
sounds like any memey discord
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:30:48
the system is based on game theory and price is part of it
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:38:16
propagating the blockchain is the weakest link not just storing it

@_date: 2019-05-04 19:31:04
it's safe until it's not, noone thought the big exchanges and mining pools would get hacked and lose all their money, yet here we are after it happens over and over and over trying to help other people not to have it happen to them
