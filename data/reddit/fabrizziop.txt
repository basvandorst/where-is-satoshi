It did fit, you just needed more ram and the 64 bit binary.
Source: Bought more ram just for Armory back in the day.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:45:11
Just download the new version and install it on top of the old one, it should work. Anyways, please back up your wallet.dat in appdata\roaming\bitcoin\wallet.dat

I'm here since price is 1$ and I haven't made lots of money, so if I think price will go down you can be sure it will go up.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:21:36
lol let me speculate : &gt;
actually it's the next huge support level, if we fall from 266$ expect to see 100$ or less.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:33:17
Nice way to not allow yourself to sell the coins, because we're goin' down!
@_date: 2014-07-05 11:21:11
You're using TOR and Bitcoin, you're really supposed to know what you're doing, it's a huge security problem to use TOR to access the web as exit nodes can and probably will spy/MITM on you, and you didn't bother to check if you were using SSL and the cert.
Sorry, but TOR isn't THAT user friendly, yet :(. This loss could be avoided with an extra warning message. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:13:24
We're going down, to 266$, prepare for the ride.

What CPU did you use there?. It looks like a VRM failure, it's normally seen on cheap 4+1 phase motherboards with a high-TDP CPU like a Phenom II X4 or above. If you used a Sempron then the failure was likely random.
fyi I saw a lot of burned MSI motherboard with the same failure, on forums.
@_date: 2014-02-19 23:07:38
Checked the board specs, I think a Phenom II X6 was too much for it, as it seems kinda low-end plus it has 4+1 phases. Please guys, if you can, buy 8 phase mobos for high-end CPUs, it could save you trouble.
You're probably out of warranty right now, but usually that's covered in it, specially if you didn't overclock.
At least it didn't burn your house :/
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:59:01
It was down earlier for me, now it loads fine.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:00:47
What platform are you using?. Regardless of that, just open the folder where the wallet.dat and the blockchain is, and delete everything in there **EXCEPT** the wallet.dat, then open the bitcoin client again.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:08:08
Please update your client first, we are on version 0.8.6
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:16:02
At the asrock site for your mobo, click specifications tab and it says something like 4+1 phase (I'm on my phone right now so don't know exactly).
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:11:18
it's in ~/.bitcoin/ delete everything there **except** wallet.dat &amp; try again

@_date: 2016-02-15 00:12:44
People here don't care about bitcoin. They just care about mining, because power is almost free. 
@_date: 2012-11-03 00:55:52
They need to allow users to create grid-based 2FA. That way users with cheap/no phones can be safer than normal.
@_date: 2012-05-15 01:20:07
Oh boy, I remember that time, it was around April 2011, I saw the buzz on /g/, and then on Overclock.net.
 I proceeded to change the TIM of my 5770 to be able to mine at a decent temp, and here I am, sitting in a hot room, with 6 5830s(5 more on the way), 1 5850 and my original 5770 with an ugly fan screwed in the ugly XFX "egg cooler" plastic(fan failed).
Well, with power cost in Venezuela at 0.01$/KWh, mining is very profitable.
@_date: 2012-05-15 23:53:55
I was thinking to make that, more on the lines of a ghetto datacenter, with the people shipping me the rigs and I'd charge a monthly fee for power, HVAC and cleaning (spare parts at your expense), but the idea is half baked and it seems way too implausible. Although it might be possible in the future.
@_date: 2012-10-14 12:25:09
I came here to talk about Venezuela but you beat me to that. I live there, and I can assure you that it's getting adopted a lot by the tech-savvy people, Venezuelan forums are exploding with Bitcoin threads, and most forums close them for legal issues, but people keep reading information about Bitcoin. The advantages for bitcoin in Venezuela is that mining is a high income activity, thanks to inflation and very cheap power I earn with 3.25 GH/s about 2 monthly full time min wages. And, the other big plus is that it allows Venezuelans to do p2p in-person transactions knowing the currency you're receiving isn't fake (fake dollars is a HUGE issue here).
@_date: 2012-11-01 15:12:19
lol sarcasm was implied.
@_date: 2012-10-23 12:24:56
LOL in Venezuela the official exchange rate is 4.3 VEF/USD and the black market rate is 13 VEF/USD. So here it gets you 200% more.
@_date: 2012-12-15 18:04:07
It's even less, official dollar is at 4.3VEF/USD, parallel is 16VEF/USD, so it's about a quarter of what you said. (you won't sell at the same price as the scarce subsidized dollars from govt are sold)

Just create and pair your GAuth token on an ubuntu live cd like I did, that way if they have a rootkit/trojan on my windows thing, they can't get to the GAuth QR code.
@_date: 2012-12-15 11:30:33
You're assuming everyone pays a lot of power bills. Power in Venezuela is 0.01$/kWh, so I easily make a minimum wage with 3.25 GH/s.
@_date: 2012-11-06 23:35:55
Black market rate for VEF is at lechugaverde.com . Prices are very good at the exchange, so I kinda doubt it's legit. Plus no SSL. My money is 1000 meters away from the site until they're proven legit.

There are easier and safer ways. Just memorize a long string. Then do like 1M PBKDF2 iterations (to slow down brute force), and use the resulting bytes as an AES-256 key. Then just encrypt with AES (in ECB obviously) the site name plus a site counter (shouldn't exceed 16 bytes). 
You could do something like that, but with HMAC. Any way, it would only be a few lines of python.

I learned about bitcoin when they were about 1$ each, in early 2011. Awfully I was only 13 y/o at the time, so I just mined with my GPU (one 5770). Well, I did nicely, making always more than a minimum wage, and now have some savings for my future. 
I spent all my savings in mining equipment back then, my family told me Bitcoin was a scam, but as soon as I learned about the technical details and the advantages it provides to a teenager of a third world country I knew right away Bitcoin was the future. 
I'm just mad I didn't learn about it earlier, just noticed it first on 4chan and overclock.net

Nice. I missed the &gt;80$ rocket, because I try to invest only when I'm almost sure I can make money (can't afford to lose much). 100$ will be a turning point, if we go up we will get to at least 300$, if we don't target is 50$ or less. ofc I'm speculating.

@_date: 2013-01-12 19:30:31
Just to know, is there any known trojan that, apart from stealing the wallet.dat, uses a keylogger to get the key?.
Personally I kept my wallet in an ubuntu/win7 dual boot system, encrypted (armory), and the /home of the linux system was encrypted with ecryptfs. But that made me see the advantages of ubuntu 12.04 over windows 7 so I switched to ubuntu fully and now it isn't offline :(

I'm there, I can confirm you could see lines and lines of parked cars outside stores, people even took the items in exhibition. In Venezuela saving money isn't good, it's better to either spend it or save it in foreign currency like BTC or USD. At least not even the government can take your BTC or make it illegal to trade btc for bolivares as it's a gray zone.

3 GH/s on GPUs, power is less than 0.01$/KwH.
@_date: 2013-03-24 11:50:05
It isn't possible. The technical explanation is: Remember the blocks you generate contain a SHA-256 hash of the merkle roots (hashes of hashes of transactions creating a tree joining them all) of all the transactions. The coinbase transaction contained in each block is the one that sends the 25 BTC generated to an address, and it must be 25 BTC or less that are generated or the block is rejected by the network.
The thing is, the information the pool sends you contains the hash of the merkle roots of the transactions that include the 25 BTC generation to **their** wallet. So, if you find a block with the pool work, and you change the transactions to send the 25 BTC to your wallet, the merkle root changes and then you no longer have a valid block.
tbh satoshi was a smartass.

@_date: 2013-02-07 00:08:40
I mean, it's really hard to get the dollars at official rates, so that's why there's a parallel market developed. So, I don't want to lose about 3/4 of the value by paying at official rates.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:20:05
This is a really important point the developers must address if they really want to keep Bitcoin decentralized. It hogs the whole upload of my 10 mbit download/ 768 kbit upload cablemodem connection. They should give the option to configure the upload limit of the client. It's better to have everybody running the client although with limited upload speed.

Me too, actually my first mining income is from 2011-04-28. I was a regular user of OCN, but bitcoin absorbed me a bit, and as they banned the discussion I had to migrate to Bitcointalk.

@_date: 2013-08-28 11:06:36
That was probably a manual transaction, you manually input all the addresses and amounts. If you aren't 100% sure of your bitcoin knowledge, please, don't do manual transactions.
@_date: 2013-01-30 13:33:35
I live in Venezuela, I can assure you that if you pay with bitcoins and they trade them at the unofficial rate the trip will be cheap as fuck.
@_date: 2013-09-08 15:16:05
Nope, but you shouldn't use it if you don't have the most basic knowledge about it. I don't ask you to create manual txns or how does mining works, but just a basic tip about bitcoin: don't send twice.

Mt.Gox will still process USD for customers who have a bank account in the US but don't live there and aren't US citizens. At least that's what MagicalTux told me in IRC.
@_date: 2013-09-02 00:33:10
He said network activity will be high and that's wrong. After all, hdd space is getting cheaper, and pruning will be implemented. 
Of course, why would you want the blockchain on a mobile device?. SPV is OK, like on bitcoinj. And there's multibit and electrum, too.
TL;DR: Bitcoin nerds like us will have full clients, the normal users will have SPV clients or other less-secure methods like blockchain.info

@_date: 2013-04-21 02:20:41
I'm 15 too, started with a 5770 back in 2011 (I was 13 back then), and now I've got 12 GPUs and 3 GH/s (power is cheap in Venezuela).
Right now, don't waste GPU life on that, it isn't worth it. Just amass all the money you can, and in 3 to 4 months, when the ASICs are in stock or with a delay less than two weeks (and difficulty is kinda stable), calculate the time to return your investment, and then proceed with your choice. After all, you don't have to provide for anyone yet.
FYI Bitcoin really helps teenagers, you don't have to enter any credit card details and you're free to manage your own money.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:52:02
Yes, lag creates further panic, and after all panic=volume=fees
@_date: 2013-06-22 02:33:37
BitMessage solves partially that problem, it just needs more initial adoption.

Bitcoin mining is just (double) SHA-256 hashing of a block header, not ECDSA operations. Although your example hits the point, people compare SHA-256 hashing with gflop/s.

There's nothing wrong with that, but it isn't a zero trust solution. Plus you will need to pay
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:35:59
They're randomly created in your computer, so they have the full entropy and not just a dumb phrase. Armory allows you to create the wallet in an offline computer and then import a watch-only code on an online PC, so the online pc can only generate your public keys (so you can receive money), but the private master code is only on the offline PC (and in the paper backup). Seriously, give Armory a try.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:41:07
Of course, that's the ideal solution, but other exchanges awfully aren't up to Mt.Gox's standards, like in DDoS reliability and so on. When a really good competitor to Mt.Gox rises, count me in.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:05:30
The full node uses up all of your upload, if I were you I'd limit the total connections to 12-20 unless your internet connection is dedicated/only for you and you don't mind.
With incoming connections, some times people automatically will connect to you to download the blockchain, so that's why the upload is hogged.
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:15:43
I'm in venezuela, too. Where are you located?. Any references or reputation?. I've bought bitcoins in person.
@_date: 2013-05-22 13:22:10
No, because it doesn't know when or if you did a backup of the wallet.
Remember the keypool is ALWAYS 100 keys, when you use one, another is generated and placed at the end of the queue, so you can use up to 100 keys before needing a new backup.
Personally I prefer the Armory client, it runs on top of Bitcoin-qt and it has deterministic wallets (only one backup per wallet per lifetime) and tons of advanced features.

I'm Venezuelan and using Bitcoin since 2011, people here awfully don't care, same with politics, they "hate" the "dictatorial unlawful government" but only protest via instagram and twitter. The situation is truly sad, the Chavistas say that "they don't eat dollars so the price doesn't matter", essential products have shortages.
There is a small Bitcoin community here, I've done in-person trades, but I think less than 0.001% of the population here know about bitcoin and even less use it.

@_date: 2013-04-14 14:30:09
litecoins are only useful for mining them with GPUs, obvious pump and dump, the difficulty changes a lot because when it's low lots of miners get in and as soon as it goes up miners leave for BTC. 
Personally I did mine LTCs but as soon as I get them I trade them for BTCs.
The only thing good for litecoin is that it's good for microtransactions because if BTC goes up too much the fees will be very high for small txns.
@_date: 2013-06-27 12:27:05
Not at all, there are reports at bitcointalk of people beaten out and robbed of bitcoins.
Just meet in a public place, after all most of the bitcoin community right now are geeks/nerds/whatever we're called, just meet someone that posts a lot at bitcointalk, that alone should reveal their intentions.
@_date: 2013-09-05 12:19:11
We will always have "bubbles", after all bitcoin is just becoming a bit known, it isn't anywhere near mainstream. I mean "bubbles" because they're accelerated growth by media hype, but we're unlikely to truly crash below the starting level.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:38:30
yeah, normal pump and dump would be something like ixcoin that was premined. 
With litecoin I mean it is only used by miners to profit more than bitcoin, and as soon as it's less profitable they switch back.
@_date: 2013-03-12 16:30:14
From what I understand in the thread, the liability is on the business. The issue is that they're "too big to fail" on the Bitcoin economy, you won't see a scammer tag in the thread, and the max "punishment" they will get from the community is a bit of whining. In several days the thread will be forgotten.

@_date: 2013-07-01 21:56:55
I don't sell as I think that Mt.Gox being fully seized/out of business is a small possibility and that's the exchange I use. BTC-e is to me totally unreliable and unprofessional, and I'm  too lazy to withdraw with coinbase, although this option looks nice. 
I think we will hit 50$-32$, so I want to sell and buy back lower.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:14:02
Keep your head leveled and feet on the ground... This last exponential growth is bubble-like. I only invested in BTC what I can afford to lose (mined BTCs), but won't take 30k$ in CC debt to purchase them.

@_date: 2013-09-11 23:35:42
There is a speed advantage, it is with the block upload time. After all, a 7 kB block is less likely to be an orphan than a 250 kB block, as your upload time and propagation time is reduced significantly.
As new transactions come in, you must change the work given to miners as the txn merkle tree will change. So, the thing is for the upload.
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:51:07
10-minute blocks are good for people with high latency and/or slow internet, as if they're mining and blocks change every minute they'll spend lots of idling time receiving the block and have lots of orphan blocks. That won't contribute to the decentralization of mining at all, as it would restrict users to pooled mining (only receiving the block header to hash) or to fast internet connections. That's the same issue than with unlimited block size.

They won't. A thai guy at bitcointalk withdrew money from his verified mtgox account to bank accounts from people he needed to pay, to avoid double hassle. Mt.Gox reported the transaction to the police and blocked his account until the matter was solved. I agree with mt.gox, they need to comply with aml/kyc to be legal.
TL;DR they verify your account for something.

Looks nice at first look, although I don't know if I understood the graph fully.

I know, I was around when the first spree of altcoins went live, like the ones by lolcust plus i0coin and those. Litecoin is the first scrypt coin to reach a nice adoption level compared to Bitcoin, and it really has a purpose by being good to manage microtransactions because of low fees and short block times.
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:09:59
Yep, but as the system is fully offline you have no mouse/keyboard use, no network packets nor other tasks contributing to randomness. Theoretically if you add the entropy to the system manually you could make it create flawed and easily-guessed-by-you numbers. 
I think the only real, practical solution is a cheap hardware RNG like  (note I fully credit the author), you could then hash the output of the RNG with Whirlpool or SHA-512 multiple times (to avoid patterns by hardware flaw) and then add it to /dev/random (for linux to hash it again/manage it as needed).
I mean, you're catering to the paranoid crowd here, the risks I've told you are tinfoil-hat level but we're talking bitcoin here.
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:42:55
Yep, I agree with you (if I didn't I wouldn't use Bitcoin). But it really changes the way of investing, after all keeping your BTC may give you more purchase power. When we reach mainstream, then I think the deflation rate will lower a bit
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:58:12
From what I've seen on BTC-e, the LTC price tends to stay between 2.2 to 3 dollars per LTC, and the LTC/BTC rate tends to move when Bitcoin price moves to keep the LTC to USD rate between that band.
Litecoin is useful for microtransactions, Namecoin for domains, Primecoin for math/prime calculations, PPCoin as proof-of-stake. Most other alt-coins are useless, they only change total amount and block time, and are probably made by people jealous of bitcoin early adopters. Yes, I'm talking about Feathercoin.

You're not buying a technology, you're just speculating on Bitcoins. If you really want to buy into the technology you should purchase too a small amount of alt-coins, remember any of them could be Bitcoin's successor.

Let them gamble, after all it's provably fair unlike a casino. Of course gambling is a loss to you on the long run, so it's pointless to do it for profit, it's for fun.
Personally I don't gamble, I only gambled 0.05 BTC on satoshidice 48% to see how fast it was and everything, I won (gambled 0.05 BTC and they gave me back 0.1 BTC), but I won't do it again.

To be part of an experimental project that break many barriers and inconveniences of current fiat, tightly regulated currency. If you buy bitcoins you're part of the early innovators of the technology, so if it reaches critical mass your bitcoins probably will be worth a lot more fiat currency (or fiat will be worth a lot less compared to bitcoins). And if not, you will gain experience in cryptocurrencies, which may be used in the future (I mean something based on bitcoins), so that skill and experience could be worth a lot.

lack of innovation, and/or premining of them before they're released to the public, to get a stash to sell as soon as they gain a bit of value. 
Namecoin has an use, decentralized DNS service, Litecoin could be considered an alternative to Bitcoin for microtransactions if Bitcoin gains a lot of value.
Litecoin changed the block rate (2.5 min), hash algorithm (scrypt), and total amount of coins (84 million).
Namecoin is merged mined, so everybody that mines Bitcoins could mine Namecoin at no extra compute effort (see them as "included" when you mine bitcoins, they're effectively free), so the Namecoin chain is kept secure and the namecoin price is very low.

Seller harassment and everybody-sane-is-bull typically signals a trend reversal. Although Bitcoin is just becoming mainstream, but still, don't invest more than what you can afford to lose (e.g. don't get 30k in CC debt to buy at 95$), remember rallys don't last forever. Although this one hasn't ended, yet.

I understand you, I'm 16 right now, found out about bitcoins on about april 2011 when people were raving on forums about how they made money with their GPUs. Bitcoin is really useful if you're not over 18, you no longer have to ask for a credit card nor anything.

Well, it's not about cleaning the fan, you must remove the inner sticker (the sticker facing the heatsink), drill a small hole in the plastic in the center, use a syringe to inject some oil there while spinning the fan to fill the inner oil reservoir, then replace the sticker you removed with duct tape (that way the oil stays there). In my case each fix lasts a year and is cheap, and if the fan fails again you just remove the tape, add oil in the hole, then tape the thing again.

The inflation is caused by shitty government economic policies like expropiating businesses, currency exchange control and so on. The official rate is 6.3 VEF/USD, the parallel rate is 30.7 VEF/USD, it means you can't fucking find dollars at the 6.3 rate so business owners have to find them in the parallel market. 
The official exchange rate also discourages exportations, as you will get in trouble if you sell those dollars at 30 VEF each.

That's the issue, your localbitcoin wallet address only for you to deposit there. If you send funds from localbitcoins to satoshidice directly, localbitcoins will probably send the bitcoins from another address, and if you win/lose they won't credit you the funds as they don't know who sent them. So, your bet funds are lost.
If you're betting on satoshidice, please use the blockchain.info online wallet, or a local wallet like Bitcoin-qt, Armory+Bitcoin-qt, Multibit or Electrum. Those are compatible.
