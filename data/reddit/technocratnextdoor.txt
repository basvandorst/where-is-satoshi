Buy a bit now so you don't regret it if it never corrects, then buy quite a bit more after a correction (probably) does happen.

Thank you, this actually does seem fairly plausible. Unfortunately it seems others in this sub disagree, but nonetheless your interpretation of the use of Bitcoin makes sense.


I totally agree, and in world where both coexist I agree that this isn't an issue.


This also makes sense.
Thank you for the answers. I think your explanations are a good example of why I totally understand Bitcoin as a store of value, but I struggle with it as a flowing currency.

I do think this is an important question. Ideally, Bitcoin would not only grow slower, but actually maybe even slowly decrease year by year if it is to act like other currencies.


Right, 75,000 Bitcoin today is 75,000 Bitcoin next year. But the real value of that Bitcoin changes. Perhaps 75,000 Bitcoin can buy 100,000 packets of ramen today, but 150,000 packets next year. For anyone who has debt, this is really bad because they're now many more "packets of ramen" in debt. If that debt is a lot bigger than whatever that student has in their bank account, they just got dealt a huge net loss.


I totally agree! That's part of my concern with Bitcoin, is it's sharply deflationary.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:13:42
It's about the direction.
The US dollar is inflationary, which erodes debts by decreasing the real value of the initial debt.
Bitcoin is deflationary, which increases the real value of the initial debt.
Volatility is a separate issue and one that I'm less concerned about so I didn't ask about.

Every currency has a real value, too, however. Yes, 75,000 Bitcoin will always be 75,000 Bitcoin. But if 75,000 Bitcoin is worth 100,000 packets of Ramen today and 150,000 packets of Ramen tomorrow, that affects my life in a big way.
That's why deflation matters even if there's only one currency. What you can buy with that currency changes.
So I'd still be interested in the answer to that question, because I don't think I answered it myself.

Err. Gresham's Law actually says the exact opposite, that bad money drives out good money, and that a more valuable currency will be hoarded and disappear from circulation. 


What about low-income people without rich friends or a good credit score? Or, perhaps more relevant to many people on Reddit, what about students who have to take on debt to go to college?


What deductive reasoning is that? You're totally right that central banks have really screwed up in the past, even contributing to the Great Depression! But more recently they've had a much better track record at maintaining stability, and I'm not sure how they could be blamed for the 70's oil crisis or the Great Recession.


Whoa. This is... a big thing, here. Are you saying that to buy into Bitcoin as a currency, I have to buy into Austrian monetary theories? I don't know if I can do that.

Wow, that's a lot of videos! Thanks for the resource. Unfortunately I can't watch all of them right now in one go, are there any particular videos in that list that answer any of the three questions I have here?

That's too much power. If I sell everything, Bitcoin will immediately be adopted as the official currency of five developing economies.

Considering that fee-free stock brokers do exist, and Bitcoin typically does have fees, this seems like a pretty weak case for Bitcoin.

Then why is it in /r/bitcoin?
