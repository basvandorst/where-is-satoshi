feels good!

I just sent them an email... Maybe they can be convinced to offer that payment option again :-|
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:04:12
Great idea!!
I think I'll tip you the 1USD worth of BTC-  I wish you the best!
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:34:32
...no updates so far, i think... You have to pay those fees for "international use of your CC"
@_date: 2014-11-19 09:27:05
nice one ;-)
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:59:28


Well, way to go... Cannot link my German bank accout and I won't use my CC (Visa) due to CC fees ;-)

The scale of the vertical axis is not like 1,2,3,.. But like 1,10,100
The distance from 1 to 10 is the same like from 10 to 100.
Therefore doubling the value of btc will always have the same length on the chart, no matter if from $1 to $2 or from $1000 to $2000!
Using this scaling makes sense, because in the field of trading, you often describe your losses or wins in %, meaning eg "doubling" or "halving". No matter, if you wete trading when btc was about $1 or later, about $1000. ;-)
I hope i could clarify...

...and don't forget about all those people wanting to collect the tray of BTC he leaves on his way up to the moon!
(I mean: there must be some reason for us to follow him up there, right ;P )

wish i had a pub accepting bitcoin here in germany :( (and nopes, i am not living in berlin...)
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:36:39

i use notepad++ very much and i am a real fan ^^ was happy to donate some!
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:29:53
yup, they partnered with coinbase. that was clear from the beginning i think. and why shouldn't they?
@_date: 2014-11-24 14:10:00
looks neat! But since my parents' home burned down, i will never store my private keys on wood.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:46:52
well, what do you expect...
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:22:26
furthermore, i do NOT see any point in posting QR codes.
this is the bitcoin sub, not the "play with you lego, lawnmower, whatever stuff"-sub   .__.
@_date: 2014-03-29 09:49:49
i agree with you-
but i also think this increase in "troll posts" corresponds with the increase of new user, so called "noobs" ;)

Comeon, you must know, how many discussions there are, about how easy or difficult it would be, to stop bitcoin- 
Besides, not everything once forbidden has failed or has been forbidden forever?
@_date: 2014-09-03 04:09:02
I am not sure, i guess some kind of tree-chain keys...
Similar to electrum? Like having a wallet with automatically generated pub keys, that derive from one seed? Usefull for change adresses etc... You'll only need one backup for all your keys
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:33:06
...not related? or related in the context of vanity btc addresses used for phishing?
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:58:33

theeere we go.
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:05:33
can confirm.  
works from Germany, but only with an international CC. (Visa in my case). Bankk acc does not work.
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:09:24
lots of misinformed FUD statements.... but also serious discussion, for those who are too lazy to translate ;-) ...so basically not different from comments on any other website
@_date: 2014-10-08 19:26:30
@_date: 2014-08-28 22:13:02
Sorry, cant provide link / proof, but: 
I read, that even nowadays, the freshly minted coins sold only account for roughly 10% of all sells- 
So there should be some downwards pressure, but dont overestimate it?
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:28:02
you do not simply get out of bitcoin *haha*.
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:28:34
The fee you pay here does only depend on the CC company you are using- and varies therefore (1% for me with DKB international student CC )
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:22:46
one try to answer this:
although nobody can say for sure, how the market will react... or if at all ;)
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:44:58
ah thx a lot, i didn't know that. i think vanity .onion addresses are easier to phish, because everybody would carefully check an address consisting of random numbers and letters. but if the original address would be "bitcoinpage123.onion", it would for example be easier to start a phishing attempt with the address "b1tcoinpage123.onion"  ;-)
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:58:40
I'm not sure, where you get that information from... "and provide an elegant, adaptive user interface for consumers to pay in bitcoin with their Coinbase wallet" well, that sounds strange, but i just can't imagine, that they would limit their service to coinbase wallets...
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:34:56
i laughed so hard :D
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:30:38
...done! several times actually ^^
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:08:45
thats it. this might be helpful, when looking at charts, where exponential growth can be expected.
@_date: 2014-08-22 07:42:38
I think it might be easier to use an android calculator, than to visit a website for that =/

After reading a similar post about Tox &amp; Bitcoin last week, i gave the program a try. I am totally convinced! Nice sleek outfit, all the functionality i need and secure, opensource, p2p, without ads, free.... It's a dream!

i'm happy to send a little tip to the pubkey provided on your site ;P

thats the adress used: 
...will contact support....
@_date: 2014-04-26 08:53:27
..and here
.. would donate if i could ^^
why not just give us an adress, since that Bitpay link seems to be broken =&amp;
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:25:24
for those, who dont know how this is related: Bitcoin = honey badger of money ;-)
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:26:54
just donated some-  i hope enough people use this :)

atm it is ~0.1 BTC for one XCP  ^^........... well done? .__.

well said. have my upvote.

Country: Germany
Buy/Sell: Only with an international CC and the corresponding fees?
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:56:33
neat ^^ ...international shipping?
@_date: 2015-05-12 14:23:15
There is a two-way ATM at the Entrepreneurship Center at the LMU (university). I've read, that there is a 100€ per day&amp;person limit, because the ATM is operated without a license. And there is only one bar in Munich, accepting bitcoin.... (  )
So i think for changing larger sums of btc to eur, you'll depend on localbitcoins or the MyCelium local trader app...

@_date: 2015-05-05 16:57:08
may i suggest coinimal.com?
located at austria, relatively cheap, instant (and direct BTC deposit to an adress of your choice), you can use popular payment services like SOFORT-transfer, neteller, giropay/eps,.....
haven't had any real trouble with them so far, but in case you have any questions, their support team is very quick and friendly!
they offer a "tell a friend" program, so if you want to check it out, you may use my reflink 
@_date: 2015-05-29 12:56:45
I dunno...
To me it seems, like expressing your opinion (alias up/down voting) should be free to do... 
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:02:47
anything required for this to work?
i am using uMatrix to block certain scripts &amp; cookies. allowing all the scripts so that the BTC address shows and then transferring the funds. wall not removed. cookies required? i dunno... did not convince me...
not asking for a refund, he may keep the 25 cent, i like the point he made!

@_date: 2015-05-18 10:41:58
There are exactly 2^160 possible addresses (public keys) as long as we keep using RIPE-MD160.
2^160 is 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976
so. generating the same address twice is- well. VERY close to impossible :-D
edit: 2^96 for private keys, but this does not change a lot...

beating gold's marketcap at one of bitcoin's peaks is one thing. beating it at an average is still another thing i guess.
it won't be an easy fight, the outcome cannot be predicted, but it will be an exciting ride for sure!

you haven't actually watched the video, right... it also explains, why 51% attack are extremely difficult to pull off, even for a government...
you failed to add something to this conversation, because you dont actually read/watch the other posts.
@_date: 2015-08-10 11:02:33
so you are living in Germany...
you might give  a try, for small amounts you won't need to verify, just create an account. The buy procedure is quick, because you can pay with "Sofort-Überweisung", you'll have your coins in a few minutes transferred to an adress of your choice
The service is based in Austria
edit: as others have stated, the verification stuff that takes so long, has nothing to do with BTC, but with the "Know-Your-Customer" and money laundering laws of the state. Once you own bitcoin, there will be no more such hassle!
@_date: 2015-07-30 09:34:48
you're not being serious, right o.O
comeon, flag it as sarcasm please :D
@_date: 2019-12-01 13:19:56
Difference is, that with Visa or Paypal this is obvious for most people. The contrary is the case with bitcoin / LN, it is just too young to expect the common populus to understand the difference.
People still have to be educated, so i think it might not hurt to be a little pedantic
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:36:43

@_date: 2015-07-21 11:14:48
i was in the same position as you are now, about 4 months ago. i took the chance. (at BLC)
let me tell you: be EXTRA careful, whom you lend money to. there are huge amounts of open loans, most of them from newcomers. i got scammed so many times, i am at -10% at the moment. considering my own learning curve i will make some btc soon, i have stopped to fund loans from rather new people and am completely sticking to "old" borrowers with 80+ successfully repaid loans, now.
summed up: give it a try, but please be very very careful.

the thing about anti virus programmes is, that there is not "the perfect one". Each has its advantages and disadvantages. While everyone thought NOD32 and Avira were pretty secure solutions, i found those extremely easy to overcome when trying to "stealth" a trojan myself. My point being: You can increase your security with such a tool, but you can !NEVER! be absolutely safe from malware... 
@_date: 2015-10-15 01:01:09
Well, on the bitcoin blockchain you can "settle" every 10 minutes (average). 
I am not sure, but i think the "usual trades" (assets etc) are settled once a day. During the settlement times, the trades are built on trust in the trading platform?
(not a pro). maybe i am wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:37:09
Enjoyed this program for more than six years. Glad to support you with some bits!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 06:39:32


OP is not talking about plainly understanding the tech. I think he means, that the parts you cannot understand about FIAT are just hidden a lot better. With crypto you get in touch with those parts you dont understand all the time: Trading, securing,....
So, lets see how that will change, i am optimistic!
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:53:41
wohoo °_°
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:01:44
