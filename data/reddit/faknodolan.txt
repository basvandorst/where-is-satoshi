Yes but ANYONE could have started mining them. Satoshi published his paper first, then started the blockchain and announced it. Everyone had a chance. Not so at all with Ripple. It's not even clear that Satoshi still has control over any of those early bitcoins, he hasn't spent a single one.

My analysis compares buying 50 BTC to buying the miner, so the price per bitcoin is irrelevant. The only variable is the pace of the difficulty increases. If it's above about 15% per cycle you'll lose, if it's below that you'll win. The devices use less than 100 watt so I just ignored cost of electricity for simplicity's sake.
The last 8 cycles saw an average increase above 15%. Time will tell but I decided to just take the 50BTC instead because it's lower risk.

Every transaction is stored on everyone's copy of the blockchain, so those transactions are STILL impractical.
Additionaly if upvotes cost a cent you'd see waaaay less upvotes. Most people would never pay a single cent.
And finally a site like Reddit can aggregate their microtransactions and only commit them to the blockchain when they are bigger than the minimum size.

Can you explain why so many people's buys are cancelled just before the end of the 4 day waiting period for being 'high risk' even when they've purchased before? It looks like Coinbase does this whenever the price goes up significantly in those 4 days to screw over purchasers.

Things are changing but not in the direction you think. Most people think they ALREADY have the freedom to share anything they want on Facebook. This is true because the stuff Facebook will censor just doesn't concern most people. 99% of people don't want to share anything that's against Facebook's TOS anyway, and they're not gonna join yet another social network. Facebook won. If someone wants to share something that's not ok with Facebook they can already do that very easily with any number of other methods.
I just don't see how a new 'private' social network can add any value anymore. Your ideological rant might be correct but it doesn't matter unless you have a workable plan.

I almost bought one of these but then I actually looked at the numbers to see how profitable they'd be... and the answer wasn't good. Right now you'll make several bitcoins per week but if difficulty increases by 15% every 2 weeks (which is the current trend) you actually won't make back much more than that 50 bitcoin you spent on the device.

Don't do it, dollar cost averaging reduces your profits, although it also reduces variance.
tl;dr: If the asset you're investing in is expected to increase in value, it's best to just invest as early as possible. Waiting and hoping the price will dip just wastes money on average.

I'm pretty sure no country in the world right now would consider Bitcoin a 'currency' for tax purposes.
Let me give you an example of how things work in the USA (and most countries I think?)
Let's say I bought a bunch of jewelry or diamonds many years ago, for $100k. Now let's say I use them buy a house from someone with a market value of $150k, because my diamonds have increased in value. For the tax office they'll argue that you sold the diamonds for $150k even though you got $150k worth of house instead of $150k worth of cash. So they'll want you to pay capital gains taxes on that $50k. And of course if there's sales taxes or whatever on the actual sale of the house those will be due at a valuation of $150k too.
Now obviously I can claim that the house and diamonds were actually only worth $120k or something and if you're lucky the tax man will agree but if you push it too far you'll get into trouble.

@_date: 2013-04-26 10:06:53
The answer to this question depends on what you do with the $150k. Do you bring it back to your country or do you leave it in Switzerland? In the case of the USA it technically doesn't even matter, you'll owe tax on it anyway. Of course there's no way for the IRS to know about it if you don't bring the money back to the USA but that's what they'll tell you anyway.
In countries like Australia you'll pay tax on the $150k if you bring it back into the country. If you move that $150k into an Australian bank account you'll have to explain where you got it and you'll be taxed accordingly.
Other countries do not tax income generated overseas so yea I see what you're saying.

I think privacy is becoming less important and people are getting MORE used to the idea that everything they do online is completely open and public. Look at things like Google Glass, sharing on Twitter, uploading to Youtube. People realize - no they EXPECT - that everything they post will be visible to the entire internet. And that's they way they like it too. Every kid in school knows that if you want to keep something private you keep it as far away from the internet as you possibly can.
A privacy network could not possibly work anyway since anybody you share something with can post it on Twitter ten seconds later anyway.

If they keep their 20%-25% hash power the share price will not drop, and asicminer is in china with some of the cheapest power around so they'll be just fine. They have another 100 TH of hashing power coming in the next week or three and much more in the pipeline after that.

For those of you wondering, here's the math: (EDIT: Updated figures)
3.5GH/s (later 4.5GH/s) Jalapeno on pre-order cost $150. OP ordered 4 and on 2012-06-09 we have BTC = $5.57 which totals BTC 108 (ex shipping)
These were later upgraded at a cost of $100 each, not sure when? Let's say it was when BTC was super expensive and thus the upgrade only cost BTC 2 in total. Therefore OP's order cost around **BTC 110**
Now that they've finally been received, you can mine with them for, let's say, 3 years, and you'd only make back **100 BTC** and that's only assuming 10% difficulty increase each 2016 blocks. Reality is more like 20% right now, which means you'll get closer to **55 BTC**.

Millions of people run Bitcoin clients, and all of these clients currently will simply accept the longest chain as the 'true' blockchain. If a bunch of merchants and a few random miners decides to fork the chain nobody will be able to transact with them without updating their clients. And we know how likely that is... approximately ZERO. MtGox will never take that risk simply to force a bigger block size. MtGox don't give a shit about the block size when they risk losing access to the majority of their customers.

Furthermore you can use a '2 of 3' key storage and leave one part with your parents and one part with your sister or something, even more secure.

They have 20% of all mining capacity right now. That's 30TH/s. They have another 200TH/s in the pipeline for the next month or two and version 2 hardware coming at the end of the year. In other words they'll probably have around 20% of mining capacity for a long time. It will take 4 years to mine a million bitcoins BUT they also sell mining hardware for massive profits so it will only take about 2 years to make that million BTC.

Have you looked at the transaction format? It's as compact as it gets. You're not gonna make any meaningful gains here.


Same as your first point, we can't substantially reduce transaction sizes.


You still need all the chains, this is not helping
In short, there's no good solution here. The main devs are not stupid, this is a hard problem. Raising the transaction block size is the only workable solution.

Correct, that doesn't make it legal though. The tax man has limited resources and therefore will go after the biggest fish. If you buy an ounce of silver with your mined bitcoins you'll probably be fine. If you buy a Ferrari you probably won't.
SELLING stuff for profit is taxable. If you buy stuff with bitcoin you bought yesterday then you are fine. If you buy stuff with bitcoin you MINED then technically you have to pay income tax. If you buy stuff with bitcoin you bought last year at a lower price than the current worth, you technically have to pay capital gain tax.
I'll say it again - tax is not on the currency, it's on the economic activity.

Dan being an idiot. There's almost zero chance that SHA will be abandoned on the Bitcoin network by the end of the year!
1) Nobody except for him are even talking about this! What makes him thing anyone wants to change?
2) Making a change as significant as this can't happen so quickly even if we wanted to. Getting everyone to agree, writing the new code, testing it and rolling it out to most people on the network will take YEARS, not 7 months!
3) Most of the mining power these days are the ASICs and they have a large vested interest in NOT changing to something else. If you can't get at least 50% of the miners to agree... then what makes you think this can happen
In conclusion, Dan doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about and he should shut his hole.

Currently they're mining 950 btc out of 3600 btc per day which is about a quarter of all bitcoins.
Once they get that 200 TH they'll be mining about 80% of all bitcoins and most GPU miners will stop mining because it just won't be worth it anymore. 
Then they could have as much as 90% of the total hashrate. Isn't this a disaster?

The tax man will argue that your bitcoins 'reside' wherever it's most convenient tax wise.

It's not about his CODE, it's about the completeness of the whole blockchain scheme and everything he built around it. Most experts don't think a single person could have foreseen everything Satoshi did in such detail. He knew that public key schemes would eventually be susceptible to quantum computers and thus used hashes for the addresses and recommended change be sent to new addresses, he realised that spam could become a problem and solved it with transaction fees and Bitcoin-Day limits, he knew how to create a robust P2P protocol to support all this, he knew he should use Base58 encoding to avoid ambiguous letters, and so on and so on. When you read his original paper you'll see what I mean. The code is mostly irrelevant as long as it works.

Well surely you can give us a ballpark number of watt-hours per dollar transacted? Otherwise it's just your word against mine. I also work at Mastercard in top management by the way, that's how I know you are wrong.
And you're wrong about miners ever going offline. They'll keep mining because they'll still get the transaction fees which will eventually dwarf the block reward. Mining power usage will only drop if people stop using bitcoin and the price crashes.
Here's my calculation: Bitcoin does about 1 transaction per second. Visa does about 2000. Bitcoin uses $150k per day in electricity. Do you think Visa pays more then $300 million every day in power bills? That's 110 billion dollars per year in power.
I think not. Their revenue is less than 10% of that! By any measure bitcoin is very power hungry.

Moore's law can never catch up to the crypto in Bitcoin. The only thing that could (MAYBE we don't know yet) would be quantum computers.
Cracking the crypto with regular computers are impossible, even in principle. A computer the size of the entire known universe running until heat death can't do it. We're safe against Moore.
But yes, Bitcoin can be updated to do anything - as long as the majority of bicoin miners agree.

Obviously the 5430 satoshi minimum is temporary. The number will be adjusted as Bitcoin's value increases. It's not hardcoded in any way. Each miner can set their own value. Additionally in about a year the block size will be increased past the current 1MB limit so everything is fine. There's no problem here. We just don't want pointless crap in the block chain, and 1 satoshi outputs are crap right now.

Make dozens or hundreds of paper wallets so you never have to do it again. Every time you use some coin just send the change to a new paper wallet. Secure as fuck. You might get someone to help you make the paper wallets the first time if you're not confident using Linux LiveCDs etc.

If most of the miners update to a new protocol then that becomes the new Bitcoin protocol - end of story. Clients will just have to update if they want to keep using Bitcoin. Otherwise Bitcoin forks and you end up with two blockchains. Who knows what happens then? Which side will YOU be on? How will you know which side to choose?

Yes you have to pay income tax on the bitcoin you mine. If you don't and you get caught you'll be in trouble for tax evasion. If you never spend your bitcoin then of course there's about zero chance you'll get caught but technically that still counts as taxable income. Think about it this way: If you started working at a new job and they paid you in gold instead of dollars, do you still have to pay income tax? Yes of course. Tax is on economic activity, not on the currency.
People do get busted for this kind of thing but obviously the tax man don't care about small amounts as much as a guy that suddenly owns a ferrari even though his declared taxable income is only $40k a year or whatever.

No that's wrong. Ripple makes it easy to exchange IUOs, at the end of the day it's just as hard to get actual currency in and out of the system. All you've done is add YET ANOTHER link in the chain (Ripple). Let's say you want to buy Bitcoin with USD. You still need to send your USD to an exchange and that takes time. And after you get your Ripple Bitcoin IOUs you still need to get someone to send your bitcoins to your bitcoin address and that still takes time. You literally don't save ANY TIME AT ALL using Ripple.

Not yet... wait for $80 in the next week or two (yes I can see the future)

He doesn't even have a lawyer! This is not going anywhere.

So... if these machines are gonna print money, why would Butterfly sell them instead of just running it themselves?
@_date: 2013-07-02 02:31:13
Yea but most bitcoins HAVE moved in the last year or two, I don't see how anyone can claim that 70% of bitcoins are forever lost. That's a mighty big claim with nothing to back it up as far as I can see.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:39:15
I like how you pulled all those number straight out of your ass.
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:58:22
So in your country, if you buy an asset and sell it for a higher price, you don't pay capital gains tax?

If MtGox fails, bitcoin will take a huge hit and many people will lose lots of Ƀ but the currency will survive. I'm not worried about that. The 51% mining share thing is a problem though. What if the next bit ASIC player comes along and busts out a massive mining rig? They could conceivably take over the chain in a matter of hours. I'm not sure what can be done about this.
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:53:44
TIL thank you
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:31:57
That's worth... like $50 per day at the current difficulty and bitcoin price?

If I do it my way I control the whole process, but using Ripple I'd have to worry about actually finding someone in my trust network to do the exchange and all sorts of other crap (defaulting on IOUs etc) You seem to assume that someone would instantly take my MtGox USD and someone would instantly grant me Bitstamp money.
My point is that Ripple is solving a problem that nobody has and introducing a bunch of new problems.

Can't he just scan the users' comments instead?

ok second worst

There are no new laws in there, they were just clarifying how they're interpreting existing laws.

Buy BTC, send to a different exchange, cash out fiat. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:42:41
ugh i hope everyone doesn't start spamming the blockchain, it's big enough already
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:22:33
Who knows. I can't work it out either. The first time they fucked me over I vowed never to go back there, and I haven't.
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:51:43
Haha with negative views on Ripple is a shill. Nice.
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:39:07
Paper wallets!

Not everyone agrees with that theory. Gold for example is deflationary and there's lots of hoarding but it's still very actively traded and very liquid. Bitcoin will act more like gold and less like dollars. There's no need to 'build an entire economy' solely on Bitcoin, regular currencies will still be around for that.
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:34:16
YES it is still possible! Contact Friedcat and he'll help you out. There are still a number of unclaimed shares so go get em!

I bet he had a weak password for his twatter

None of these have a history of hitting their targets so I'm not worried.

It looks like my original post was correct. Source:
$150 for 3.5GH/s Jalapeno pre-order in June 2012. OP has about 30GH/s which is around $1300, cost of a bitcoin was $6.6 which is around **BTC 195**
@_date: 2013-05-30 00:42:05


Er.. yes it WAS! Where do you think the 5430 number came from? Gavin calculated the cost of a transaction to the network and it was 5430 satoshis. 


@_date: 2013-04-27 04:59:01
No? Why?
@_date: 2013-06-14 08:45:29
You are buying a fixed number of bitcoins each time. DCA is buying bitcoins with a fixed number of dollars each time.

They seem to agree with the conclusions of this presentation.

Remember that most office printers have hard drives and will store your print jobs for a long time after printing your wallet.

No they treat it like any other valuable asset, like diamonds or whatever.

If I make a new one I have to take my new paper wallet backup to the bank and put it in the safe deposit box with the others.

They are all 'pre-mined' so you can't. The owners are keeping 80% of them for the investors and they're handing out the rest.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:27:18
We already have multiple exchanges! I don't understand what you want.
