Related: Ghana Medical Help started a cryptocurrency endowment fund for 2 reasons:
1. As a savings/investment account that the public can verify. 
2. As a way to defer converting cryptocurrency into fiat, so that we can eventually spend the cryptocurrency directly on goods/services (mainly shipping and medical equipment).

We have looked into beamremit.com as a way to transfer funds into Ghana. Unfortunately, the great majority of our expenses are medical equipment and shipping, and it's tough to use bitcoin to pay for these. 
We began a cryptocurrency endowment fund so that we can save in cryptocurrency with the expectation of being able to buy medical equipment and shipping in the future with cryptocurrency. This allows us to invest cryptocurrency to bet on its long term future. For more info:
