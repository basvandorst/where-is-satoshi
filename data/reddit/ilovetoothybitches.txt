1000^2 = 1,000,000
10,000^2 = 100,000,000
nov 2015: $376
nov 2016: $739 (+~50%)
nov 2017: $7300 (+~900%)
this is exponential growth

thats really cool. I wish they were more common. Its an exciting time to be alive.

this is my thought. If you buy at X, you either sell at X + Y, or you panic sell at 4/5 X

omg it was such a nightmare. GDAX gave me $50,000 leverage. I could have times'd that by 7 but I never would have used it because they were so untrustworthy. Especially around times when bitcoin prices were going crazy. What is the point of 0% interest on trades if whenever you actually need to make a trade the network is messing up and theres noone to contact about it.

it is scary i agree, but it could happen. i would happily keep 100% of my wealth in bitcoin if I could easily spend $5 from it for daily cigarettes and travel. We have ATMs, imagine if there was a reverse ATM for selling for direct cash? Imagine if you didn't even need to and your local corner shop accepted bitcoin? I can see bitcoin going much much further than it is now, which is pretty much just an investment. 
My brothers a stock trader and doesnt understand bitcoin. Ive tried. But the one thing I say to him is; imagine if you walked into a store and the clerk said you could get your coffee 20% cheaper if you paid in bitcoins? Youre going to go buy bitcoins, even if theyre a million dollars each.

my most successful trade was during a sell rush on GDAX and the network was so bad I couldnt sell. Next day I'd made over $400. My girlfriend was bragging to her dad that I was a successful trader.

Thanks. That helps a lot. So, I need to secure each receiving address and collect all the private keys separately? With my funds being split between each? Thats quite annoying.

I only use alts if I want to increase my BTC. Fiat is what my bank is for.

which is why I shut down my GDAX account. Coinbase support is useless. I lost my phone and they said there was no way to recover the lost 2FA stuff. Wanted me to make a new email address and reverify on a new account. Lol no.
