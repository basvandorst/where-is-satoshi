So apparently it was an exaggeration to make a different point than your actual point.
I suppose whatever interpretation I use for "underperforming" you'll go back to "I was simply spouting nonsense to make a point".
Other than that, what exact scenario do you have in mind in which ending up with more Bitcoin than you would have had otherwise is a bad thing? 
And if you didn't want Bitcoin exposure in the first place, give someone USD collateral, borrow Bitcoin from them and bet that. Then repay them their Bitcoin at a later date, once it "underperforms".
Summa: the grapes aren't magically sour just because the fox is stupid, short, and lazy.

It's probably denominated in BTC because BRK isn't cool enough to have a site somewhere that allows you to make bets using Berkshire shares.
How "BRK is kinda shitty" turned into "BTC is unfair" in your head I have no idea, but it may be 'cause you spent too long in line at the State Welfare Bureau.

This entire nonsense with "goes to zero" is much akin to someone whining that he can't buy puts on BRK struck at 18 cents. 
The discussion isn't about whether the Sun doesn't come out tomorrow, whether Obama publicly admits Putin is a much better leader, whether Bitcoin goes to zero.
The discussion is about whether the best that the fiat world has to offer can compete with Bitcoin. And the agreement, at least so far, seems to be that it can't, by a 200:1 margin. That's all there is to it.

Bitcoin changes whoever owns it. Think of it like that ring.

This is a perennial question. Who is buying oil futures on NYMEX? Are they just bored traders, trying to outsmart each other? Are they actually self-directed IRA investors or oil refineries or whatever? Probably some mixture of both types.


MPEx's own Mircea Popescu actually [ ( released details of the naming scheme&lt;/a&gt;. That leading O means it's an option.


This is not actually how the world works. For instance, the number of people sleeping out in an open field every night is pretty low, especially if compared with the number of people sleeping behind closed doors which are behind complicated corridors which are behind more doors and possibly doormen which are behind traffic jams, police stations and customs agents.


In theory it would appear so. Bitcoin behaves paradoxically (yet again?) in that a smaller number of well capitalized investors create a much more efficient market than a large number of amateurs working on negligible capital. Surely in terms of drama generated per BTC traded MPEx is woefully behind.

Ad hom is perfectly legitimate when someone pretends to act as the uninvited judge of disputes they don't quite comprehend.
Other than that, who exactly told you that when refuting some stupidity masquerading as a "hypothesis" I'm held to bring a hypothesis of my own?

GPG is hardly new software, is it? As bitcoin clients come out of their perpetual beta your proposal might very well be a good idea, but as it stands you don't replace three decades old "new" software with something some kids coded out of a paper napkin, a beer bottlecap and motorola's qt.

What's with this shirt phenomenon? Three threads on the subreddit front page (that I saw anyway)? Seriously? 
@_date: 2012-10-25 12:03:21
The article does not discuss "race". That's your own contribution. More generally, it's quite clear reading it that it follows a cultural rather than physical anthropology vein, and so your racial preoccupation is wholly misplaced.
The article does not discuss inferiority, that is again your very own contribution. (It does discuss difference, obviously, but that's something else).


Makes no difference what follows that "because." Did you do your homework ?
No you didn't because. F. Next time, do your homework.
More generally, it is not okay to run around calling "retardedness" anything that doesn't jive with whatever little you groked of the ideological mishmash being presented as a viable alternative to reality by whatever second tier college you happen to be partying at.

@_date: 2013-02-03 09:16:27
No, you and scanonn both fail at logic. Not that both of you aren't half decent at disguising it under semantics/being really confused.
It's not a problem of "being ready for the same". It's not the same, inasmuch as Mircea Popescu pointing out actual flaws in actual bad designs is not even vaguely comparable to random anon herpderping about temporary, quickly resolved, non-mission critical outages that they wouldn't even know about in the first place if the same Mircea Popescu hadn't described them. Sure, it'd be nice if every random anon were Mircea Popescu, and it'd be I guess nice if trivial occurrences could be somehow parlayed into stuff to write post mortem about. Apparently it doesn't stick, what can I tell you.
Go troll walletbit about post mortems, that's a case where customers wanted to place orders and weren't able to, that's where you need a post mortem. Or whatever, keep doing whatever you do, just...why is it that you expect me to explain to you why you're stupid?! I don't really care. How the fuck should I know "why it was"? But if indeed we believe them when they say they charge 50 BTC for an account or w/e, then it can't possibly be any sort of DDOS. Do I need to explain to you why registered accounts can't be DDOSing a service or can you figure that much on your own?
Reddit is quickly becoming the new BTCtalk, where do all you willful retards sprout from?!
@_date: 2013-03-02 23:48:04
Let's do some actual math. Currently the site says 7day OIX: 42.62 on 12,332.19 BTC volume. 
ITM Calls (O.BTCUSD.C290T) cost 0.32495870 BTC per, and have an implied break-even of 29 / (1 - 0.3249587) = 42.96 BTC/USD. Thus 1,000 BTC spent on these would push the OIX up to (42.62 * 12,332.19 + 49.96 * 1,000) / 13,332.19 = 43.17 (+0.55, +1.29%). 
OTM Calls (O.BTCUSD.C490T) cost 0.10275012 BTC per, and have an implied break-even of 49 / (1 - 0.10275012) = 54.61 BTC/USD. Thus 1,000 BTC spent on these would push the OIX up to (42.62 * 12,332.19 + 54.61 * 1,000) / 13,332.19 = 43.52 (+0.9, +2.11%).
If you had 1,000 BTC to literally throw away you could either buy something to the tune of 10k BTC for a 10% slippage loss on the exchanges (netting you a -1k) or else dump 1k into Calls struck at 49. It seems likely that the 10k BTC buy on the exchange would yield more price influence than the 2% OIX influence you can obtain, for much less actual risk. Therefore we can actually say that the OIX is (significantly) more stable/tamper-proof than any spot-rate based guess.
Whether it actually predicts anything however is an entirely different matter.
