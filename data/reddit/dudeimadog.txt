Sorry guys guess the protest is off, Apple can do whatever they  want

Here you go op
I find her more attractive with her mouth shut or preferably full though
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:27:21
I'm not trolling I'm telling you in my opinion people here have a complex about having to prove they are right all the time.
Maybe it stems from the fact people said "yea bitcoin will die" over and over in the past and subscribers here are used to arguing their point but now that sentiment is changing too many people feel the need to be right all the time and it puts people off inquiring and getting involved in discussion 
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:52:53
That sounds like what I'm looking for, will give it a read now

From a guy who made a lot of money shoring this, 
I pledge one hug and $50 to suicide charity.
Or you can just call me up but I will only advise you to go long soon

Wow, a jew who claims to be Scrooge McDuck.
I never seen that one coming /s
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:10:53
whale confirmed in my view, with so many bitcoin days destroyed it has to be someone big
@_date: 2014-01-24 12:25:54
Hide yo bitcoins, Hide yo wife because why would they do this just as the market is on a knife edge over china.
I'm going back Fiat until Monday
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:30:36
Well lets just say in comparison to Dogecoin the Bitcoin PR department is seriously lacking.
You can say it's silly and daft all you want but it sure has brought some fresh air to crypto
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:54:45
Can anyone tell me how do I go "long" to squeeze  those assholes more ?
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:43:39
I disagree and as someone who has worked in PR the best thing for bitcoin mass adoption right now would be to shed the image that it's something tech guys and libertarians are into.
DOGE literally found it's gap in the crypto market by doing just that and the positive vibes there vs doom and gloom about the world economy here are much more enticing to journalists and news sources.
R/bitcoin could have raised that money to send Jamaica to the winter Olympics but the thread would more than likely have descended to pros and cons of charity.
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:51:01


You just backed up in my mind what is wrong with r/bitcoin right there, 
It's like some sort of Libertarian/Free market proving grounds here now where everyone has opinions and it's all about justifying their own particular stance and if anyone steps out of line with the majority opinion it's all about downvotes and disproving them.
Take a leaf out of Doge, Lighten up, be friendly and have a joke about the impending financial apocalypse once in a while

They share the orderbook with bitstamp so they have that whole market as well as their own. 
Some other posted pointed to it being fake but I did only see one 2 orders at that price so had to be the same person imo
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:32:38
I thought it was a free market after all
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:53:51
Looks bad like whole database is either dead or pulled
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:52:35
But what if I want to buy more and don't want to wait to transfer fiat when the price might rise. :)
I'm not in the us so cant buy on coinbase either 
when i heard of people shorting the price you could out your bitcoins up as backing to buy more or something like that I believe
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:13:26
I would love that sooo much as they going to go nuclear on libertarian ethics as well.
I can just see Cartman now playing the "Governments gone too far role" 
@_date: 2014-09-24 01:00:38
someone linked a guide below which seems to cover it but yea margin is the correct term
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:18:16
Hedge in Doge the only safe coin right now
