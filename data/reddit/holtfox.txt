Convert some of your fiat value in that checking account to BTC.  You now have more BTC.  Same thing as working capital in a business. 
If your goal is to accumulate, this is an easy way.

Gresham's law is not applicable in a digital age.  There is not need to hold fiat if you don't value it.  Simply trade to BTC.

Over the past decade, we have checked that box.

Discretionary - There are enough places that take BTC to at least start. Companies such as Flexa, Bitrefill, PayWithMoon, etc.

I don't believe Gresham's law is applicable in a digital age.  There is no need to hold fiat if you don't value it.  Simply trade to BTC. 
If I had the option to take a silver coin or a silver-plated coin, I would always choose the silver coin and then pay with silver coins. Additionally federal law said both coins were valued at the same price.  There is no such law.

This is awesome.  I tested Moon this morning - Super slick integration. 
 I have my cart packed for Prime Day.

You rock. What is wrong with these people who have such blinders about using Bitcoin as an actual currency. Don't they realize that they can actually hold more Bitcoin if they do so and that they're spending will increase the number of transactions on the chain and create value.

Ok.  Great.  Use [foldapp.com](  Just start spending bitcoin.

Pretty dang easy to understand your gains from a block explorer and simple spreadsheet. 
Report your gains and there will be no problem. 
Making a decision to not make money because you are fearful of an audit is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.

There was nothing in the post that mentions going all in.  By no means am I suggesting to go all in.  I highly recommend a diverse portfolio.  I am simply saying non-deflationary asset such as BTC will outperform deflationary fiat.  
If you have a checking account, you have a percentage of your assets in a non-interest bearing deflationary asset. NOT good. 
I guess I should have called out **discretionary** a little more.

LOL. Fair enough!  But seriously, when I talk to people about spending BTC, there is almost a visceral reaction - "That is stupid - you need to hold or accumulate.
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:43:08
Because the BTC payment providers are growing. Example: paywithmoon.com, tenx credit card, etc.

I am very curious. What countries?

Taxable - only if the value appreciates.  Wouldn't it be better to pay \~30% taxes on an asset that increases in value. 
Not buying an asset in fear of having to pay taxes on it's appreciation isn't how you live life.

My point has nothing to do with the age of the person. The point is - In 1960, you didn't have internet or computers. Credit cards were just really rolling out. There is tremendous ease of transferring from one currency to the next.  Not the case in 1966. 
Additionally it is bad comparison in general.  Coins were mandated by the government to have the same value regardless of make. A silver quarter and silver-plated quarter were both 25 cents. Bitcoin and USD have fluctuating prices (sometimes too fluctuating for my nerves).

Chicken and egg problem. Customers won't get Bitcoin wallets because there's nowhere to spend BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:41:08
Yes. You are. However with an average accountant's advice, you can easily stay out of trouble. You will simply sell the BTC to Fiat and buy it again for short term capital loss to offset the losses. Leaving txable amount at only 5k

Get paid in fiat.  Immediately transfer all to BTC. Wait until the day the bills are due.  Pay in BTC.  
Get rid of the fiat immediately via exchange. 
I guess this is the case if the infrastructure is complete but if it was ...

Not more than the value appreciation of BTC. If you were able to keep a $2000 higher balance in BTC over the course of a year, you would be far ahead.

Taxes for crypto with a blockexplorer will be a piece of cake.

For those crypto investors who have been in for over 6 months, the market is still ~3x what it was 6 months ago. 
On 8/5/2017, the market was $100B. Now it is ~$293B. It for sure sucks to have so much value wiped away but 3x in 6 months is damned tough to beat. The market heated up to fast.

I am an American and am working in Beijing. The consensus is that BTC won't go much lower 6000. Also, it will all slow down on Friday when Chinese New Year starts.  Chinese New Year is like Christmas except they don't have credit cards so they need money now.

How did it increase that fast? The market as a whole is still double from 5 months ago.
