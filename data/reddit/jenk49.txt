Permissioned ledgers are the antithesis of Bitcoin and decentralization.

Exactly, so expect the same old scams and frauds with their permissioned ledgers.  Expect banker bailouts, and expect it to fail in the long run when it is forced to compete with decentralized, trustless, permissionless ledgers like Bitcoin.

Kind of like SWIFT??? Been there done that.

Well some of us are sick of the scams, and the banker bailouts, and illegal asset forfeitures. Some of us are sick of getting permission and and giving up all of our privacy. Some of us think that centralized scam systems won't last forever, especially when forced to compete with decentralized, trustless, permissionless ledgers.

Max Keiser says that Blythe Masters is the devil incarnate and that her and some unscrupulous people are trying to take over Bitcoin:

Of course they see the Bitcoin barons advancing, with the look of freedom in their eyes.  Her and her JP Morgan cronies need to take action to cut it off at the pass.  They will fail however, and Blythe and company won't be able to keep up with the power of decentralization and freedom.  Ultimately she will realize this and then position herself to join the advancing Bitcoin freedom herd and abandon her crony capitalist compadres.  This is already in the back of her mind.

She is still the devil incarnate according to Max Keiser, and is working with unscrupulous people to take over Bitcoin:
