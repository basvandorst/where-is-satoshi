They buy bitcoin because they think it helps with erectile dysfunction.

If it crashed to $700 I wouldn't really lose much investment, so im a little more comfortable than someone who buys in at $1200 and obsesses over watching the charts.

Try not to fuck up and lose it.

How long until all these people realize they were too late to the show and sell their newly bought bitcoins popping the bubble?

Everyone is like, "Better get some bitcoins"

I think seeing a couple years of steady increase attracted some people in to the crypto market.

I imagine it's going to take longer than usual.

Is there something wrong with investing in bitcoin to make money?

I'm not up that much.  I made a bit on ETH, but bitcoin has served as a high performing savings account for me.  If it explodes maybe I'll be able to pay off my student loans.

I use to use that Acorns app to save money through debit round ups but noticed I was losing money through fees or poor investment performance.  I made the switch to making a weekly buy of bitcoin instead.  
If I need some money for something I'll sell some coin.

I have friends that want to buy but they're waiting on a "dip".  It's been several months and they're still waiting and the value has increased several hundred dollars.  You'd be better off just jumping in and getting accustomed to the day to day fluctuation.

Bitcoin will die when the sun turns to a red giant.   And everyone will still be arguing about increasing the block size.
