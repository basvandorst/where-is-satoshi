No memes.

wow! $700k is a lot of money!!
@_date: 2016-04-23 19:01:20
This should certainly help our cause. Another thing for Uncle Sam to be afraid of.

It's going to be a little noisy in the theater but the film could surprise ya. The Pharrell "brotha-to-hoe ratio" thing where she shows her boobies part is promising.
@_date: 2015-12-06 14:17:55
Carvin wanted to tweak it from the inside out with little to no reservations. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:38:48
SHOOTER FUCKIN' JENNINGS, THAT'S WHO
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:46:20
What an arousing thumbnail
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:28:23
Oh cool, a meme
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:43:39
Just sad we didn't get in on this action sooner :(
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:19:55
How do I get the sound working?
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:34:38
Lol! Meme!
@_date: 2014-04-26 13:47:22
It's the upset memecoiners downvoting all of our new submissions. I'll bump it for you. Good work!
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:02:02
Ugh can we not do the MFW, MRW thing in here?
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:50:22
Memecoin is merely a fad anyway
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:38:49
When they found out the Dogecoin guy, a bunch of cult like fanatics showed up at his home and forced their way in. The stuff after that is too disgusting to post here
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:03:33
Memecoin I call it. It's discrediting legitimate crypto-currency 
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:09:24
It's Mark Karpeles from the future

I have to pay to view this article...
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:12:49
Less talk, more memes.
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:43:46
I thought memecoin was dead?
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:58:19
This scam preys on the dishonest. Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:36:30
No memes. Take it elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:32:38
Memes? Really guys?
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:23:14
Now THIS is the type of stuff I like to see in here, not these fking memes and gifs

@_date: 2014-02-04 04:01:48
It's a ploy to discredit crypto-currency and it's working
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:40:57
Okay that's it. I'm done with this shitty sub. You let memes and unrelated gifs ruin what could have been a great community. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 07:51:50
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:27:52
So I'm supposed to just take your word for it?
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:34:14

Are you not going to cite the post you grabbed this image from?
@_date: 2014-06-14 23:38:44
Fucking hell what the fuck
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:08:31
Are the memecoins having anything to do with growth/weakness?
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:58:05
Seventeen hours later and still no proof?
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:00:06
This makes no sense. it's just gibberish.
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:32:09
Can we use it in-store?
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:26:10
i'm reaching my *tipping* point

FRAUD ALERT

@_date: 2014-05-02 20:33:14
Oh weird. It does exist! I actually don't follow meme-currencies, as I believe they hurt btc's credibility

@_date: 2014-05-02 20:37:30
Cool. Now get out there and make actual purchases with it.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:15:33
Stick to memes.
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:21:33
It's gone to the ether :(
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:41:01
Hahaha memecoin is still taken seriously?
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:36:30
What they did to the dogecoin guy... It was disgusting!
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:39:20

LAWL HAHAHA LOVING THE MEMES GUYS KEEP IT UPPP
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:37:47
I love the sad fellow trying to make this about dogecoin, aka memecoin
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:11:50
I knew it. What can we do about this?
@_date: 2014-05-18 19:18:31
Ahh, another meme :(
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:39:57
Who the fuck is Dorian?
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:27:59
"Hey buddy! How about you lend me a few thousand bitcoin, you know, to ensure something bad doesn't happen"
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:13:57
Because you put your own wallet QR on here hoping for a handout?
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:58:29
What's with the mugshot?
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:32:40
Allow me to say, dogecoin is dead. It's all about the baby!
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:06:49
Come the fuck on... Why is this shit being frontpaged?! THIS ISN'T FUCKING MEMECOIN
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:31:12
Sorry Doge :(
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:02:25
Nah. Rather post memes.
@_date: 2014-10-12 10:38:56
When a mommy and daddy really love each other...
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:02:59
I just sent a coin over to that QR
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:57:32
Your move, memecoins
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:28:32
Not to mention all the rapes,
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:44:45
Could I make this purchase with my bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:00:25
May he rest and be remember.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:29:41
Is this like Grindr?
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:34:00
The Dogecoin is for the kids and the Bitcoin is for the parents.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:58:18
Don't tell me what to do.
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:11:27
Man, they're really trying hard. Gotta hand it to 'em
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:24:39
What's the memecoin doing during all of this?
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:02:28
This sub is one big joke, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:20:37
If anything, this type of thing discredits Bitcoin. Hell, just look at Dogecoin and how that died :/
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:25:32
Nice referral link!
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:16:52
Dogecoin is dead. Nyancoin is where it's at.
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:29:32
I understand bitcoin, but memecoin? Seriously?
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:47:43
I hope my .1 makes it there 
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:14:16
I knew. Nyancoin is next
@_date: 2015-05-25 03:34:05
You're a fool if you don't believe there was foul play involved.
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:24:15
I feel like Dogecoin or any memecoin discredits more reputable and accepted forms of cryptocurrency. The more their fanatics plead and demand for their currency to be accepted (among businesses), the less likely people will want to deal with Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:47:58
Haha. Appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:06:59
Hell yes! I love and support all things Israel!
@_date: 2015-05-18 11:13:48
They got his bitcoin too?I didn't see anything about that
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:36:25
Where did all of the mtgox coins go, anyway?
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:29:34

@_date: 2014-02-04 03:37:31
It's still a joke. A pretty malicious one. You'll see.
@_date: 2015-05-25 14:54:21
What's with the dykerock?
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:42:58

What's with the headless stick man?
@_date: 2015-09-10 04:02:24
Sorry Bernie. I've found my guy
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:31:43
This is HUGE news. It's only a matter of time before it's reflected in the markets. Hold on to your butts, people!
