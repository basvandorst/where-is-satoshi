You’re being facetious but you’re right. They tied up the guys wife and took their baby. I doubt that guy would act as hard as he says in that situation.

Imagine being able to /played your life and see all the strange menial statistics that show up. How many hours of your life have you spent on the toilet? I bet you Reddit has tripled it.

Sell them to collectors and use the fiat to buy BTC. No idea on directly trading them. I suppose you can put it a Craigslist ad saying you want to trade for crypto.

The difference is he said "I don't need help from my family now" which implies that they were going to cover it for him and now they don't have to. Look at the whole picture man.

I heard he hard forked Reddit and is now pushing Voat is the one true Reddit.

The difference is he is paying for med school with his profits. Anybody spending money meant to pay for their school on Bitcoin is a dummy.

At least OP is buying back in with the money he would have been using on the mortgage. They might never reach the amount of BTC they had before ever again, but if the value continues to rise this will be a great decision. Being debt free while having your own house paid off is nothing to scoff at.
