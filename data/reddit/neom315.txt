Considering Bitcoins are totally decentralized and because of that not directly "sponsored" or Promoted By a powerful entity yes!, this could be the only way to have leverage, bitcoins are by any means something created for the people and the people should use the only way they have to make their voice be heard, ERGO, you fuck with the people, the people will fuck you up.
This is democracy 101

Hodlers here and no brown pants so far. regret feels like loss? try to make 200k and lose them all then we talk about it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:27:55
This underline how important is to share more info as possible about the LN in order to understand every aspect of it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:27:17
it's not an infinite number of transactions, as far as I can understand, the channel open for a fixed amount of BTC and once that's reached it closes itself automatically and you have to reopen a new one.
But definitely cheaper then paying 20$ every single time
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:07:20
thanks to clarify
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:08:45
for your opinion? I'm sorry you really are wasting this great space now and my time.
I am trying to talk about something concrete, and the usual troll comes to say nothing except how good he is with the money he has not made, just because, hey I am in reddit and I can be someone. wtf.
there is really no chance to talk about the actual crypto situation on Reddit?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:57:54
lol point taken
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:21:05
Thanks, yeah I was going through the whole situation and I wanted to have an understanding of the problem witch is not a giant issue, but still is an issue, Xapo specifically I think have played they're clients by omitting in first place of this info and I believe only to avoid an exodus of clients. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:52:36
easily accessible to you perhaps, but clearly not everyone, including me, that have not yet a full grasp of how this technology works and discussion is what makes this topic clearer, definitely not act as a superior entity.
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:51:07
No! We need Atomic swaps and lighting network, then Bitcoin will be the most reliable and "exchanger free" coin on the market, fluctuation is another story.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:44:18
Yeah, i am not implying any specific attack, I think its just weird, none of these providers have given any warning whatsoever!
Anx for example have warned they're clients almost 2 months ahead.

Cmon seriously! someone needs to stop to post gif and pics depicting a cartoon reality, not everyone here is a HODLR or a first-time investor, not everyone here buy high and sell low or post stupid gifs of a fucking theme park rollercoaster going up or down depending on the trend.
Here there are people that invest in BTC and spend them every single day, people that hang on tight on theyre investments and come here to find some kind of common ground to understand what to do with theyre future, because yes, BTC have changed the fabric of our life, including mine, but in these moments I am fucking tired of these teenegers meme depicting nothing, some have really invested money, time and life in this and the last thing i wanna see is a buzzfeed memes that means nothing, they don't entertain anymore they just annoy and diminish everyone else effort who is just trying to understand what do to when times are complicated.
Rule number one, don't invest more then you can loo....bullishit! you don't get rich by being moderated! Then a minute after...buy when there is blood on the street...! truth is no one knows anything and so we all make fun of everything to feel less stupid, well it doesn't work we all are.
Let's work on making Bitcoin the movement it should be not a joke that in 1 year no one will remember.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:13:26
The actual situation with Bitfinex and tether being subpoenaed is the normal consequence of them not being audit properly, this does not necessarily mean Btc is dead, but definitely that there will be a reassessment with a much lower value, I am just speculating, but considering the importance of the allegations, we might see drastic drop to a price maybe even as low as 6.000$ if not lower.
Let's remember all the drama and FUD circulating to the equation and we might see a very severe adjustment.
In the long run, things might turn out well, in the short, I seriously believe there is already an earthquake shaking the very fabric of crypto currencies.
Everybody can see there is a homogeneous drop in all the currencies not just Bitcoin, so something else is at work.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:03:00
I haven't ask for your opinion about my sentence.
i am not pretending anything, i am expressing a personal sentiment like you, like the OP, like everyone else.
You are talking like a big shot, clearly because you don't understand what i said "big shot". but yeah maybe you are just a dumb...like me
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:49
Coincodex see it at 3500$ where Gdax buy at 9500$ There is something Fishy going on here.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:47:17
by exchanging larger quantities and not pretending to exchange 10$ worth of bitcoins for free, that's how.
What amazes me about people talking about high Fees is the idea we use Bank accounts and ATM withdrawals for free when we don't.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:38:04
And Actually, you should.
The market can't reach the levels is expecting to reach without some pushback.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:23:36
But we are in 2017 right? and even in this scenario, I would not call 25$ an investment, nothing personal everybody has their own vision of what investing means.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:50:27
Spike is real, got the chart on coincodex
But the same spike is visible on bitmex.
At the moment all exchanges seems giving a different value, ranging from 18.300$ to 17.854$
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:47
since then they are putting the real "today" price
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:59:44
CME will start trading bitcoin Futures, CBOE will do it from today.
There is the understanding that today will be Long term contracts and the 18th will be short-term.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:42:55
I wouldn't call a 25$ bet an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:08:08
you can exchange bitcoins in the currency you need, not every Hodlers are Keeping 100% of the coins in they're pocket, some exchange for profit (and buy more).
I honestly can't see the "hyper high fees" that someone sees, of course, if you move 5.000/10.000$ worth of bitcoins you can afford the 20$ fee, but honestly, i have made smaller transactions with as low as 3$ fee and they all went through quick and easy.
That said right now Bitcoin is an Asset to consider for middle/long-term investments, not an everyday currency, wait for just a little for the lighting network to kick in then you will have a almost free/instant currency.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:47:33
If by "the entire world" you mean my country then No! I don't have free banking and if you would do your due diligence you would understand you don't either
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:23:22
Because the buyer expects bitcoins to be worthing much more than 50.000$ next year.
If he/they are right they will still buy at 50.000$ per bitcoins instead of the actual price, which can be 100.000$ by then.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:38
Check Gdax 0 sell 0 buy there is a wall! this shit will hit the fan, Bch are inflated because the tokens generated by all coinbase users finally able to get their Bcash post Fork, but they can't sell
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:03:28
no in terms of....No, very instructive answer
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:04:42
Not yet, but thanks for pointing it out, i will defenetly.
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:58:18
what you mean with checklist? 
in my case i speak about investing around 100k to get (as far as i am understanding) a ROI of 450k in a year or so, but of course this require due diligence home works.
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:06:05
i believe that right now to get some serious cash and by that i dont mean millions, you shouldnt go for less then 10/12 units to start, the incresing difficulty makes it (in my humbling experience) prohibitive to kept for more then a year..
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:02:48
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:37:41
i saw Virwox works on this matter, but it needs 48 hours to evaluate the transaction (which is not a huge deal), thing is that i dont know if its a reliable source.
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:34:13
problem with Localbitcoins is that theyre rates are totally crazy, i just checked them and they sell at 440 usd, not mentioning that if i go to check paypal in the methodes of payment i dont see paypal in the list..
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:48:22
no in terms of what? Elaborate please
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:09:51
heh yes i speak about mining, to buy the hardware and start digging in lol
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:07:21
actually in my country electricity could be free yes, you just need to get the deal with the renting, thats why its super interesting to mine here...

174 thousand transactions 3 hours ago and now 166 thousand it's fixing it up! just made a 3k transaction, went through in 30 min  
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:49:25
I did not! I am reinforcing the principle 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:54:38
The first rule of HODL! keep your coins and don't get scared by the fluctuations, they can be high, but if you can wait, you can make a shit ton of money with them even now! so Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:39:17
Are you a teenager? I have lost 45k in this dip!! but made over 150k in three months put your shit together!! cmon this is how the market is built, if you don't have that money to invest in the first place just don't invest them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:25:09
It's Possimpible!

That's the best moment you will ever get to jump into BTC! with all the fucking FUD around it, 2x failing and a dust attack to block transactions, BITCOIN is at 6.1k by now!! and bitcoin cash is "STILL" at 1.5k after all the money pumping. if that doesn't provide enough support....
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:39:08
You don't see Visa comparison relevant? find me an atm that can let you withdraw btcash or a shop that isn't in tokio that can let you use Btcash to pay for anything at all.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:58:31
Well! that's starting to be interesting, I have made few small transactions yesterday, with a fee at around 5$ for around 100$ it went confirmed in 19 minutes (1 confirmation).
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:40:31
And yet, Price keeps dropping like a bomb.
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:42:50
wizards? no, people with more understanding then me yes, about possible scenarios that might aproach, theory or speculation of what can situation means. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:30:01
what this could mean in term of devaluation?
would be my bitcoins useless? valued back to zero? 
I have read a ton of articles and i still don't understand, should i sell all my bitcoins before finding myself with nothing in the end? or my bitcoins will still be there in the end? there will be high fluctuations?
