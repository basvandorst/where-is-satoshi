You could buy gift cards online, and redeem in store.

Definitely keep us updated as to the route you take. I was one click away from a Tiger Direct purchase but went with Gyft and Amazon in the end because I was more familiar with the transaction...  even though it cost me $20 more.

"Suspended service due to unusual activity."
Same here, I've been using Circle for months with no issues, now I cannot log in, cannot get an answer from support.
Reading thru this sub looking for answers.

Yes, but very little. I was generally moving into BTC and then transferring to another wallet, not leaving much balance in the Circle wallet.
This turn of events is very disconcerting.

Also, I was in the same boat until yesterday. Three emails in so far to support, no response.

Be nice if I could use it. Still waiting on a reason why I'm locked out of my account. Been over a week now. The only response was that I'd be getting a response in a few days.

I DM'd them on Twitter and they got right back to me but told me it would take a week. It has been a little more than two days thus far.

Same boat here. I'm going to try contacting them to see if it helps.

Nice. Be nice to see a modern version, better quality. I myself have been on the receiving end a few times and have written about it often.

Never talk to the police. If they knock on your door--do not open your door. If there is anything of any questionable legal standing going on in your house, don't even make noise. Don't flush the toilet, don't sneeze. Sit quietly. They will say all sorts of things from outside to encourage you do make a noise, or go to the door. If they have a warrant, they are coming in anyway, so don't even worry about it.
Always refuse to be searched. Never volunteer any information. Always ask if you are under arrest or free to go. Always be polite and respectful.
If you are under arrest, ask for a lawyer.

You can get text-to-speech with other apps, just not Kindle for some silly reason.
