Pretty simple, there is a trading ban on Russia by Nato countries because of the Crimea and Ukraine situation. 
So their currency gets devalued over time so bitcoin would just make it worse. The Russian Ruble has been going downward against the dollar for the last five years. But took a sharp downturn in may 2014 when the they went into Ukraine. 
So to to keep the Ruble stable they make it harder for people to leave for better currencies and so bitcoin is a clear threat.
The Blockchain working group at the Russian bank is probably just some people looking into the technology to understand it better. I don't think they care about innovation in bitcoin, understand that Russia is a semi totalitarian state, there is so much more freedom in the west. And having control over currency matters means power.
Even if someone there would make a crypto no one would use it, heck no one I know uses bitcoin on a day to day basis, there are so many people that are technologically handicapped, even just people in their thirties.

the f rune stands for "faun" that is a rune that means "wealth" and "cattle". Aur is also the name for the krona because 1krona used to be 100aur. But the inflation has been so dramatic that Aur or no longer in use. You can read more about it on  Then you have the Aurora Borealis that is quite common here in the northern hemisphere.

In the West there is so much more freedom then in China and Russia. What do people expect from these totalitarian regimes. If Putin can't control it through his horse leash it is not going to be allowed.

Never invest any money you cannot afford to lose. I would advice investing only 15% of your income every year into high risk investments. Some people have to learn it the hard weigh though. It is the way it is.

But why now suddenly? Are they afraid that the norwegian currency is going to devalue? Have they run out of oil and gas to sell to foreigners?

Apple has fallen out of grace or you could say Apple has fallen out of Eden. hohohoho

Im glad apple opted out of the ban. Bitcoin is bigger then just one company or even a country for that matter.

Statistics is just that, based on past, there is no meter of human aspirations in it.

I had plenty of btc on an exchange many years ago, then the exchange went out of business. But it is all just percentages really. I think btc is going to 50k in 2 years and to 300k in 10 years. So just buy before 50k and count your monetary blessings. Imagine the guy who bought the first pizzas for bitcoin. He's still happy go lucky.

What happens if the government of USA will not raise the roof of the ceiling in January. I have a pretty good source telling me that it will be a long strike or maybe they default, game over. Maybe some people will be flocking to bitcoin. The dollar has an unlimited supply and the feds can just keep on printing I guess they can just keep on raising the debt ceiling. But it is a question, if they wont extend it and take this with a grain of salt( im not an expert) the contractors of the government will not be getting more money. And people who work for the government also. Government bonds will go down or plummet. But the ones that borrow money to the USA such as China would they want the debt ceiling to be raised or not? their investment in government bonds would go down but still, can USA pay their loans back if they are always raising the ceiling? 
Who would benefit from the government NOT raising the debt ceiling? I mean, technically they are bankrupt and have been so for years but they just keep printing more money. They are too busy saving their falling system. And with the affordable care act(obamacare) more states will most likely go bankrupt because they can't afford it. This is one of the biggest reasons next january will be a long strike because the republicans will not stand for obamacare just like they did last october. And something tells me the tea party guys might have gods will behind their backs on that one. But either way, the system is technically bankrupt and how will Obamacare function in that kind of a system, will it last for months, years, I give it 18 months tops if they raise the ceiling. But when it falls how will bitcoin stand. Will bitcoin be like gold, that always rises in demand and value during a crisis or will it go down. I guess it depends on how the bitcoin market is going to be connected to the other economies on how the effect will be.

How will people want to transact with this currency, it is swinging like a bubble stock. And what about its security. Will the future not have encryption-breaking technology? I am sure governments are looking into all these things to determine if it might take off ass a new world currency, i.e. merchants all over taking it up. However if it is not perfect in all these cases I mentioned and how it will stabilize, maybe some other stable, un-hackable digital currency will be produced.

Hehe yeah I would say it's pretty good. So you think the republicans are going to back down again?

Because Bitcoin is now in the global consciousness more then flooz. The internet was not as big then as it is now. I think more people have heard of Bitcoin now after that china news then people have heard about the Swiss Franc or the Norwegian Krona.
