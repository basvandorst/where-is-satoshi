There’s fewer places to buy things with bitcoin now, therefore it’s failing as a currency. What have you bought in bitcoin without first switching to fiat, in the past 12 months??  You’re too biased 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:55:35
I don’t know if this will happen, but if it did happen, I can already read the articles in the future about how vast sums of money were wrenched from the hands of well-meaning investors in a matter of 6 weeks.

But that’s not my risk as the consumer. I’m being facetious to make a point. Why would the average person use some dodgy exchange when I’ve got a Visa in my pocket

Bullshit. Most people just wanna GRQ, you think because you immerse yourself in this sub that everyone is like you. The Facebook effect, positive reinforcement

Purse.io is a gimmick. How is introducing three or four unnecessary steps that someone can make money from you, an alternative to currency? It’s not. So fuck off. And the original comment was about currency you dickhead
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:35:45
You’re so biased it’s unreal. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:07:36
I agree with you. I was fretting over coming in at 5k because it seemed overvalued but I’ve just watched it come up and up since then, almost like watching a car crash lol. Can’t describe it. I don’t think all the mass media coverage helped things. Well, helped a few investors, but did bitcoin itself no favours in the long run. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:54:01
Sure, ignore my point, and keep surrounding yourself with the chorus of little boys, with their pocket money in BTC. You’re a winner in my book.

You’re going to lose money with such a blinkered view of things 
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:37:34
It’s not growing though, as a currency. In fact you’re less likely to use it as currency as you were 12 months ago due to the volatility of its equivalent fiat value

Houses aren’t bought speculatively by average joes. Whereas bitcoin had mainstream media attention and a flood of new, Dumb money all towards the end of last year, grossly inflating value. I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes more than 2 years to get back to 20k. You heard it here first. Also don’t buy bitcoin now that’s stupid advice

You’re acting as if the majority of people with bitcoin aren’t concerned with the dollar equivalent. People need easy ways to turn it in to USD, hence the need for coonbas etc

I don’t have any bitcoin and won’t be buying any. Fair play to the people who took a gamble (keyword gamble) early on and have made some money - if they are sensible and turn some into real money. Now there is no money to be made. This forum is drowning in confirmation bias. But it’s entertaining. I can already see the news articles in a few years time after it crashes and bitcoin becomes meaningless. See you then x

Bitcoin got to nearly 20k because of massive media attention, with stories featuring in every newspaper and website, however mainstream towards the end of 2017. The balloon inflated and popped, but now, the naive investor is going to listen to the story of how people lost 50% of their money in a week, so they won’t come. Now starts the game of finding bitcoins true value whatever that is. These threads are just wishful thinking and cherry pick statistics. Whilst ignoring the lack of consumer protection versus standard stock investments. Tread carefully with your birthday money kids

@_date: 2018-06-18 12:21:21
I couldn’t tell you what caused the initial run up to 5k but I can say fo sure I was reading articles about bitcoin in mainstream media from November onwards and that definitely contributed to the 19k meteoric rise. Doubt we will see that again
