The exact same thing happened to me. I got three deposits of .0001, two were to addresses associated with my coinbase account, one with my circle account. All last week within ~2 hours of each other. Figured it was spam, but I'm trying I to ignore my tin-foil hat feeling that it could be something more.

is there a chance the track could bend?

Hey, thanks!

So, are these newcomers late to the party?^Sorry^couldn't^help^myself 
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:30:52
Are we having fun yet?

Hey guy, I don't know you and don't want to come off as a dick, but posting your direct link to your change tip isn't a very good look. 
It is the same thing as holding a cup out on the sidewalk, only it is worse because you have an open laptop/PC next to you so you won't garner much in the way of sympathy tips. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:12:34
Good stuff, thanks in advance!
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:28:12
Isn't there a street corner you should be standing on, yelling at people who are trying their best to ignore you?
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:27:55
I think this is a very good thing. I always thought that r/bitcoin could take a cue from r/dogecoin about spreading the love, so to speak. That's the biggest reason dogecoin became a thing, the upbeat/friendly attitude of their members and their willingness to spread around a little bit.
The stuck up and sometimes dickhead attitude of people in this community stifles growth, which is a shame.

Thanks friend!

I have not gotten ripped off (in the bitcoin realm) and do not plan on it in the future. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:16:51
I figured it was a reference but I still enjoyed it, Gooey.

This is concerning, I've been using their service (mostly sports related) and I have only had 1 bet disappear (it reappeared within 2 days, after I politely emailed support about it) and 2 bets take 2-3 days to process. Overall, they have been honest/good to me. If it means anything, all the bets I had issues with were Golf related, I don't imagine they get much action on those. 
But if 20 BTC disappeared on me, yeah, I'd totally lose it.

I'm with you, things are feeling *different* over the last few days. I'm not sure that means we are heading towards the moon, but something is going on.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:11:46
Nice, keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:10:29
That's powerful stuff, Mr. Farts. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 23:35:38
Yes, I second this. Cloudbet has been fantastic to use throughout the football season.
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:50:35
This totally makes sense. All of it. Wonderful writering. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:47:44
I used shapeshift for the first time the other day, I think the service is fantastic. However, I had to use it at work (different state) as it is blocked at my home.

I'll put together a press release.
"The CEO of bitcoin not dead, just aroused."
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:26:29
I do the same, you are subject to potentially hour(s) long deposits and withdrawals, but as long as you stick to the more reputable sites it works.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:09:35
You should talk to my neighbor the accountant, probably a great golfer, huge ass.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:23:25
It does, thank you. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:07:35
Hi Matt, is there any limit on the purchase? Could I, for example, pay 20 dollars for a 3-4 dollar coffee and get 16 dollars back in btc? Apologies if I misinterpreted the whole thing. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:16:57
Hey, thanks for doing this! 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:45:58
I have not.
The design looks pretty awesome, but otherwise I'm fairly ignorant. 
Again, the ignorance. But, it looks pretty!
