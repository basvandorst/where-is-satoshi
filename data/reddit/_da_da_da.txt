This. Probably the most consistent theory so far. The gag order just doesn't add up.

It's nice to see some sanity here on @_date: 2014-12-29 13:38:19
Misleading title (you don't buy bitcoins, you have to register on a third-party, what you buy is a voucher), and the news is 4 months old (published september 3rd).

Exactly. "Bitcoin will take off, say guys with millions invested in Bitcoin". ..

Ok thanks!

Sweet! Quick question: can you filter results by type of conversion (Fiat-&gt;Crypto, opposite, or both) ?

Common sense vs circlejerk

and whether they were salted.

Very excite!

nope. ;) no complaints except what I mentioned in my original post, and I'm not sure it was their fault.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:51:29
I should have unsubbed long ago, this was the nail on the coffin. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:39:57
How does it work with traditional points of sale? Did you register with a payment network? What kind of API do you use? 
Very exciting project! I'd love to be an alpha tester, I have a Galaxy S5 running an AOSP rom. I'm touring Europe at the moment so it would be a great opportunity to test it in many countries in a short time span. 
Edit: does the device have to be online to complete transactions?

In another comment they implied they were using HCE, so 4.4+.
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:21:23
Thanks! If I understand HCE correctly, you are emulating a "card"  (virtual/tokenized) from a major payment network. Right? Does this mean you issue your own cards?

Does just-eat accept bitcoin ? (real question)
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:04:49
Thanks ! Arduino makes such things a breeze to develop. :)

Almost no one will accept PayPal because of potential chargeback scams. The only direct way I know is  but don't expect to buy a big amount there.
Don't forget localbitcoins.

All you need is an Arduino and a few lines of code :)
I made that past week.
@_date: 2013-10-16 11:03:14
The price is pulled every 5 seconds from the BitcoinAverage API by a [python script](
The value is then pushed over serial to the arduino. [Ino here](
