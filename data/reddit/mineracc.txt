You can't ban crypto. That was the entire point. They are unbannable.

The entire premise of that video is fake. There is no such thing as "iou's". Once a transaction is submitted in the lightning network it cannot be undone. Once the lightning channel closes the final balance will be written to the original chain.
The way he talks and then starts to point fingers to Blockstream it should already be very clear he has an agenda. You can hear the "I have no actual proof but look they are the baddies" in his tone.
Also bankers opening lightning channels doesn't matter. They can serve as a channel for transactions between users, but they cannot print Bitcoins themselves. They don't own any power to do anything with the lightning network than host it and receive a very small fee of each transaction done on their network. 
Think of it like using Uber, they can be a service to help people transfer their Bitcoins between eachother. They can't just take off with the Bitcoins. You don't have to trust anyone who runs a channel. It's just a service. 
He also very obviously avoids talking about why nobody wants big blocks. Because his side is the one that actually pushes for centralisation.
I'd really just recommend watching an actual video explaining lightning and it will be a lot clearer than this made up bs.

So why Btrash instead of Zcash? Bcash has MASSIVE fees, Zcash is like 4 cents. Zcash can be used privately, and its even faster.
Bitcoin cash has absolutely no reason to be their alternate coin. Bcash is a little faster than Bitcoin but it's way worse than almost all other alts out there.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:24:19
The money goes where the hype is. If Bitcoin has its scalability finished everyone would come jumping back. No coin currently has a solution yet so it's silly to say that you invest into tech. The tech grows with time, not with money. I severely doubt that Bitcoin raising in value would somehow speed up its development.

Scroll down a bit to the bottom to "red flags" and the gigantic flaws start being described. It's a very layman term article you should easily be able to understand it. 
Basically it just required something incredibly difficult to actually work, but because they don't have that difficult thing yet, they currently run a node that validates everything, basically taking away all decentralisation. 
Also that "incredibly difficult thing" should basically be the reason Iota actually has value. Problem is that they don't have a solution yet, thus defying the entire point of it.
It's like saying "wow we can make mankind teleport to to the moon and walk on there with spacesuits. The spacesuits are ready, but the teleporter doesn't work yet so we're using normal rockets"

If someone finds an extreme exploit that allows stealing any funds or worse, duplicating funds, it would devalue Bitcoin entirely. That currently does seem pretty much impossible though.

Idk if you're wilfully ignorant, a shill, or just incredibly stupid, but maybe you should turn on your brain for 1 second and think 
"Wow if all we had to do was increase the block size, why doesn't Bitcoin just do that? We wouldn't have Bcash then!"
And maybe you'll find that increasing the block sizes isn't a feasible way to run Bitcoin with the secure properties it's supposed to have.
This isn't about current transactions. If it's supposed to be the actual world currency. Millions of transactions per second. Upping block sizes to infinity is retarded and it's nothing but a band-aid until the network overflows again. Bcash is a stupid quickfix.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:23:50
This sub is overflowing it retarded ad-hominems just as hard as the Bcash sub right now. Can you morons stop devaluing something because of the person behind it? If the product is shit you call it shit. Attacking Roger instead of Bcash just screams that you have no actual arguments.

Bcash is Bitcoin with a little band-aid. It solves none of the problems, the only fix they adopted was to make it less secure in exchange for more speed. A choice Bitcoin made purpose.

Is Bitcoin really the best coin though? The idealism is great, but personally I support Monero more. Satoshi had a great vision, but even his plan wasn't without flaws.
 Currently Miners hold tremendous power over Bitcoin, and they refuse to implement all kinds of changes because it would result in them earning less from transactions.
Bitcoins change is dependant on people who would earn less money by changing it. Sadly miners aren't good Samaritans.

Quickfixing them and working with a network on lower load might have something to do with that.

Altcoins are perfectly fine. They don't try to name themselves Bitcoin and steal the project. Ethereum has made a big name for itsself already with something different. Bcash however barely provides anything new and just tries to steal the Bitcoin name. There's a thousand altcoins more suited for trading than Bcash already.

I personally think Bitcoin is still way too risky to use as an actual payment method for store owners.

I have a feeling this skyrocketing will straight continue until 5k and then some people will start selling, some with the intention to buy back in later through the dip.

1) Get 10 people to loan you $100 each, and get them to think about it as a deposit. You now have $1000 cash, and owe a total of $1000.
2) With your $1000 cash, lend out some amount **($1000, $5000, $9000)** to other people. If you lend out $5000, you'll now have $1000 on cash, **$5000** loans owed to other people, and you'll still owe $1000 to the original people.

If history repeats well we'll be dipping hard until we reach around half the initial price (5000/2)= $2500. Maybe a bit lower.
After that a steady rise of a few % every day, and the occasional dip. Then at some point the hype will start picking up again and it will skyrocket.
Now Crypto is always unpredictable but this has happened a few times so far so it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect a similar trend.
Don't invest any money you aren't willing to lose though. I'm personally not cashing out what I've invested until I've either made mad bank, or lost it all.

Tbh PayPal offers great protection. It's pretty hard to scam people with PayPal's service just recharging the money.

Trump just allowed America to go so hard in debt (passed a bill to go beyond the previous hard cap of 19 trillion) you could make a super sayan montage about America channeling what it's like to go beyond 19 trillion debt.
So now the USD is plummeting to new depths. Just Fiat doing Fiat things.

Maybe some of the whales with 5 Al's, insider knowledge of every big decision and an army of experienced speculators.

The gold standard is when money was backed by gold in the safe, and it was actually there. These days money is just worthless paper without any intrensic value.

US is exactly the same. They just don't do it as often, but when something threatens the government (hey Edward Snowden) suddenly there's no actual differenxe between US and China. There is no freedom.

If trend follows last few crashes we may very well see 1/2 of the price it had  before the crash or even a bit less, before it starts rising again. I think there's a very big chance we'll hit at least $2500

Yeah the US banning gold to push fake Fiat is free market lmfao. Dream on.

Not sure how serving any amount of time for using his "freedom" is fortunate.
The US is the exact same as authoritarian states. As soon as something actually threatens their rich, suddenly people get arrested for random reasons. The only difference between US and Venezuela is that the US doesn't need to crack down as much on people because their economy isn't complete garbage.
If US currency was as unstable as Venezuelan currency they'd ban Bitcoin directly. Just like they  banned gold because it posed a threat to their fake fiat money monopoly.

Personally I think this will be a very extended dip. Currently people still have way too much hope. Only when everyone loses hope and starts selling (a few months in) the whales can buy up the newbies, will the price suddenly start massively rising again. People will buy the coins they sold a few months ago for higher prices etc etc.

Oh wait they can't. Their entire system goes down.

Haha too real man. Had some brandead explaining how Fiat was better than the gold standard and baseless loans (the cause of all the massive economical crisises which only banks profited from) is somehow superior than having a gold supply.
Apparently fake money is better than real money.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:46:20
Thing is, Bitcoin is already outdated in many aspects. They are just the biggest and most reliable coin at the moment, coupled with its rarity is where the value comes from.
If Bitcoin takes a super dump and another better coin takes over, Bitcoin is never going to climb back up again unless extreme changes take place.

If history repeats well we'll be dipping hard until we reach around half the initial price (5000/2)= $2500. Maybe a bit lower.

You should probably get some other cryptos too. Putting all of your money in just Bitcoin is very dangerous.
Right now Bitcoin is the biggest and most trustworthy currency, but it isn't very easy to use. When something comes along that will be way more accessible to the mainstream, Bitcoin  will fall.
No king rules forever. Especially in the computer industry where the entire place looks completely different every 10 years.

Problem is banks can't loan out crypto they don't have. They can send you fake digital fiat never existed, but they can't just send you more Bitcoins which they don't have in stock themselves.
