I think the most important security failure in the exchange is when the client gave a bunch of money and personal information to an untrustworthy guy who then stole all of it.

Yeah, I understand that. But there is no inherent benefit for you, only when the vendors share their benefits with you do you see a real benefit. Internet shopping is so beneficial to the consumer that it was essentially demanded that the vendors participate. I'm not sure that benefits to vendors--&gt;consumers will be strong enough to create a fundamental change like with internet shopping. For instance, vendors now benefit from cash sales, but only a few places have cash discounts so the consumer rarely sees a benefit of carrying cash.

Because there are still bitcoins being mined now. That is one explanation as to why it's not a problem but could be in the future

I was just referencing the "you can send any currency" statement you made. I've paid for things on the internet from different countries in dollars using my debit card without a charge to me. I don't know what merchants are charged.

You can contract around most anything and the customers are likely not reading the contract for their 2500 dollar checking accounts
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:30:32
You could say the same thing about dollars right now

The benefits of paying your mandarin tutor and getting a netflix discount are both dependent on a vendor shifting their monetary benefit of using bitcoin to you, the consumer. The benefits of the internet over physical shopping are direct benefits to the consumer. If Netflix doesn't offer you a discount (say their contract with a cc company won't allow them to) and your tutor accepts paypal, all of the benefit to you is essentially gone and you've lost the financial security of a bank or cc company. Internet shopping seems different in that it was so much easier for a consumer that vendors changed their ways, not the other way around.

I think they get it from interest on loans and investments so you could say that the people they loan to are paying for it with higher interest rates. You could also say that they recover it from fees like overdraft charges so in that scenario, the public would be paying for it. Neither of those really makes my blodd boil though.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:49:34
You can only send bitcoins if I'm not mistaken, not any currency. And you can only send to a person or company who has a bitcoin address. And it'll get harder and harder to do it without paying a fee. It may succeed like internet shopping, but maybe not. I think it's a weak analogy either way.

Property records also don't just show "x owns this land" they contain fact-specific details about rights to access and use portions of the land so it would be hard to have a simple number-based transaction history for a piece of property. I can't figure out how that would work.

You can waive a right by most definitions of the term excluding yours of course.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:01:18
Great I think it's important to realize that some rights must be sacrificed to protect the rights of others. Now to the other question, why do you define nihilism as being the so small?
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:19:30
I think you're born with the right to do anything you like and the Sovereign government has those rights given to it by the people in the Constitution. If you'd like to exercise those natural rights that directly conflict with the Sovereign's exercise of its rights then you will probably lose. So what do you do? You say "well maybe I'll waive my natural right to waive my dick around in the street." Obviously the Sovereign has not considered your right to waive your dick around in the street worth protecting above the rights of other people not to watch you do that, so while you may be born with that right, the Socereign has been given the right to stop you from doing it.

That video makes a lot of assumptions that have no basis in reality it's an interesting thought experiment, but I think one of the main things it assumes away are irrational actors. And it didn't answer my question in the case of a trespasser who has not consented to arbitration (in the video's world, that would be a guy who doesn't have a rights enforcement agency).
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:47:01
What the hell are you talking about? I'm referring to the attitude of "let's get rid of all of this regulation and whatever happens happens." I also don't understand why you think nihilism is small. I think of it as amoral and apathetic I'd like to know what the fuck your idea is
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:45:57
I see what you're saying, but I think that the reason those two examples don't need the force of a government backing them in their decisions is because of the fact that they would like to participate in their respective communities. How do you resolve a dispute with someone who doesn't care about the respect of the community? If I want to stop some antisocial asshole from beating my ass up or just taking my house in a strictly private social setting what's stopping him?
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:21:41
What's your point though?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:30:20
You may have a contracts claim if you did anything for them. I don't know what those sites were about, but if they benefitted from having your coins stored in them, then you likely had a contract. Depending on where they were running the site from, an American court could have jurisdiction. 
It may be economical to get a group of people who were stung by them to sue them as a class.
I don't know how the sites were run, so I don't know how difficult it would be to find out who the person is or where they were running the site. In the future, it would be good to know the person you're dealing with so you can take them to court if they screw you over.

Environmental regulations on the whole are incredibly valuable in our overpopulated society. They internalize external effects for polluters who otherwise would not have to account for the damage they do (including loss of life) to the people as a whole.
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:03:03
I haven't read it, but it seems like that's based more on hypotheticals and assumptions than descriptive, scientific examinations of actual governments. I fundamentally don't believe in anarchy as a viable option. Specifically, off the top of my head because of what I see as the inevitable monopolization of water and oil.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:43:13
That's a pretty ridiculous statement to say that governments don't exist. The Sovereign is a group of people's will personified and it has the rights granted to it under the Constitution. It doesn't have more rights than you, it just has a police power and an army so the Sovereign wins if you two come into conflict.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:04:39
I'm not saying that that's good for society on the whole, I'm saying that that's a potential benefit for a non-techie bitcoin user and a vendor.
Edit: it looks like I was responding to a previous question you asked
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:01:42
What? I thought your objection was taking people's rights without their consent! Your anarchical society, in it's ideal form, means you buy whatever rights you can afford?

"In less" for "unless" is the most ridiculous malapropism I've ever seen written. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:03:46
Yeah, so we are born with them and we waive them by choosing to live in this country and adhere to the laws of the land written in accordance with our social contract as outlined in the Constitution. Love it or leave it!
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:25:25
It can be both. The truth is that we live in a society in which the state has certain powers which it defines by the Consitution. Whether or not you want to call the powers "rights" or not and whether or not you want to call the government a sovereign is up to you. I think it's pretty unhelpful to say "the government doesn't exist" when clearly people tend to follow its rules and participate in its programs.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:54:58
Yeah, but the trespasser hasn't consented to arbitration. So who has the power to arbitrate and why would the guy with the stronger security force consent to arbitration?
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:08:06
Vendors could avoid reporting their earnings and offer bitcoin users a 5% discount while still making a lot more money than they would if their customers used a credit card.
@_date: 2013-12-28 07:17:46
Yeah, I don't see why centralized currency is at issue here as much as selective enforcement of white collar criminal law.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:44:03
That's an honorable goal. Mine is generally for the wellbeing of society as a whole with a protection for certain inalienable rights to individuals.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:31:46
No, I think at best it would be what we have now. At worst it would be what's going on right now in every country without a central government which is war

I think the monopoly on "justice" in civil trials is the monopoly on "protecting rights." Whether or not private arbitrators would provide the same service without the FORCE of law behind them is debatable and I would be skeptical although things like FIFA and the emerging body of international arbitrators acting on precedent are two prominent examples of arbitration systems working without government backing. However, those two arbitration systems do get their decisionmaking authority from groups of people agreeing to abide by their decisions (the soccer community and the international business community respectively, but those aren't elected positions so that's an interesting discussion to have). I think those arbitration systems are a good example of two people becoming more than one because they do find their authority in the collective trust of the community. I disagree that elections are "religious" and would be interested to hear why you think that. Also I think the mafia is a form of government but are working without written laws, which makes them lose a lot of accountability and for me, legitimacy.

Congratulations, you successfully completed a conversation without asserting a single point besides "governments don't exist." The idea of a sovereign is pretty widely accepted, I'd like to know why you're so quick to dismiss it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:16:20
 this is essentially the basis for all modern political science.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:51:29
Civil trials are a good example of the government protecting individual rights. The reason I have trust in the government agent is because she is either elected or appointed/hired by someone who was elected. If you want to argue about the legitimacy of elections, I agree that money has undue influence on the winners and I would prefer more power be put into the hands of local officials, where my vote actually counts. Are you untrustworthy of the government agent just because she's a government agent? (Also notice how brave I am by using the feminine pronoun)
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:29:07
You're assuming the guy without the security agency is in the wrong. If there's a dispute, then it's probably because it's unclear who's wrong. If there is a dispute, he'll be fucked unless he pays one of the two security agencies that exist whatever they want him to pay. 
The scenario I'm thinking of is more like this. I get hit by someone who has car insurance and because I don't have insurance their insurance company takes my money to pay for the guy's car who slammed into me.
Also, how do you settle a dispute with a security agency? Go to arbitration, got it. Who's the arbitrator going to favor? The guy who's there for the first and only time or the repeat customer security agency who can take the arbitrator off of their form contract? This happens now when insurance and credit card contracts contain arbitration agreements in their form contracts.

What gives the private security firm the right to enforce what they or their customers belive is their right to property or personhood against someone who doesn't agree?
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:18:09
I see what you're saying. I think it's worth it to give government officials the right to do things I wouldn't want the hobo on the corner doing. The government also protects rights, it doesn't just crap on everyone all the time.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:34:29
How would you describe what's going on in Syria besides two competing rights protection agencies? Anyway, you have a faith in the market that I will never have and it's been good talking to you about your ideas about the possibility of successful anarchy. I have a short, interesting book on the growth of "governmentless" arbitration in the international petroleum community if you'd like to read it. It's not exactly a case the total elimination for territorial government, but I think you'd like to read it. PM me your address if you'd like me to send it to you. Later man
