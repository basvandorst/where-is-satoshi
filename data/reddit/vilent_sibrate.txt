It was over a year ago. Why do trump supporters keep bringing up the election?
edit: it's possible to think trump is a crook while also not liking Clinton.

I understand what you mean and you’re not wrong, but I see him less as a troll and more of a gaslighter, which is less benign in my view.

If you think his stupid “jokes” and style are what’s fooling the media, you are the fool.
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:52:18
I think his ego is exactly as big as it’s always seemed to be. He acts like he thinks he has all the answers and says he is his best advisor.
Seriously, my little brother says “I was only joking” when he gets in trouble.  You expect more from a 73 year old man.
Edit: I also take him seriously when he makes comments about how “negative” speech does not count as free speech. You should too.

USD and other fiat currencies are used for money laundering and financing terrorism way more than bitcoin fwiw.
I’m not a leftist, just a libertarian pushes out of the party for not wanting a ballooning deficit. Fuck me right?
If you don’t like what the news says about trump, maybe you just don’t like Donald Trump?

That’s worse

Just some advice. If it’s a decimal either round up or down. Don’t give the exact amount.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:08:57
I have. Works fine for me.

My only successful arbitrage was converting 1k of altcoin to BTC when BTC was 8k. Instead of completing the arbitrage conversion when it hit my ratio I am still holding the BTC.

The price of solar energy on small scales has halved in the last two years. I can see miners setting up renewable operations in the near future when set up costs allow it.

But the trump supporter never addresses the original claim. They are saying it’s ok because of X.
I find people on the left are far more quick to criticize Obama (iraq, Syria, gitmo) than a trump republican about potus. They literally can’t do it.

The idea is to *keep* debt, not pay it off.

Haha what? Why are you bringing up gender? I’m curious what you meant by “they” are salty. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:45:17
Because trump won’t say in detail what he would sign, they can’t get enough republican sects to agree.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:36:49
That’s quite a jump man. No one is saying that. You’re upset because the WH constantly changes on its positions and it’s difficult for WH staff to defend what Trump says.
Anyone who criticizes the WH is automatically a liberal, and it’s impossible for a conservative to do so?
Weird times.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:51:43
Many top republicans publicly stated they were waiting in the WH for detailed plans on what they would accept. Which is what held off voting. McConnell said he wouldn’t bring anything to the floor unless he knew the president would sign it because the WH was unclear on how it would proceed. Trump said he would sign any bipartisan bill on television during the televised meeting with R and D leaders. Days later he changed his tune. 
This is not limited to immigration. Trump tweeted out opposition to renewal of section 702, to which the next day the WH press office released a statement saying that the president DID support 702.
Back to cryptos... I hope that the WH does indeed plan to not support heavily regulating cryptos.
Edit: and just to be clear, I do support ending chain migration, better border security, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:46:53
Just stating that the WH doesn’t know what it wants, so we should take both action and non action with equal amounts of salt.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:29:08
I don’t think you understand my question. I’m asking what demographic you think have the ability to be critical of the WH.
Only people “unsure” of their gender ? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:07:46
That doesn’t mean their constantly changing positions don’t impact the legislative process. For example immigration legislation. The house wouldn’t even take up a vote until they know what trump wants because they know it will change.
Awful leadership.

He don't care

In the end, regulation is good. It means advocacy.

Who is they?

Yeah... that’s a government run bank in the eyes of the US banking industry. I think if it’s more than 40% owned by the state... maybe 50%.
