That's an oxymoron no?
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:08:48
Is there any financial benefit of running one of these? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:34:07
I prefer delta app

Sign up to Coinbase and deposit your 5k there. Don't buy the BtC there though!
Once fund are credited to go Gdax.com and deposit your Coinbase funds and buy BtC. It's instant and Gdax is Coinbases sister company! Doing it this way you buy BtC with zero fees. If purchased on Coinbase you pay 4% fees!
From Gdax you can withdraw as many or little BtC as you like and pay in to exchange to buy altcoins or if you just want BtC withdraw to a BtC wallet. Under no circumstances never give out your private key. In fact just create a paper wallet and lock it away in your safe and forget about it until latest beginning of December where no doubt we will go through the same crash we just recovered from

Bitconnect! 2.0
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:59:15
A £ or two below the market price bro
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:22:35
Coinbase is a more user friendly commercial fiat gateway to cryptos. Gdax is more for professional traders and takes more input to purchase which is why you get better rates. Especially if you're making limit orders. YouTube search Gdax and you'll get a visual reference and better understanding of the benefits and commission charges as to why it's better. 
You still need to deposit your fiat currency in to Coinbase but that's all you need to do then everything else within Gdax.
There's also a lot of altcoins out ATM which will have a much better return over btc but they're done after you managed to purchase your btc from Gdax. If you want any pointers or info there I'll be happy to help but just having btc and leaving altcoins alone will still give you a great return if you buy sooner rather than later.
Let me know how you get on or if need anymore help. No need to pay 10/20% commission for an advisor. Team work makes the dream work!
But tips welcome and can send to my btc address...
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:29:18
And yes you can also set which fiat currency you want to view your portfolio in to 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:50:03
So you're a scammer after credit card details? 
If not sing up to local bitcoins. There people can purchase btc and send you without the need to give you their previous credit card details

It's so much better than Coinbase!! Instant deposits and withdraws, zero fees when buying and withdrawing. Better base rates of cryptos. Coinbase is for newbies looking for instant crypto. Gdax is for more seasoned buyers who don't wanna get raped on commission and fees.

Still doesn't work though
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:44:50
No one onows
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:33:06
Ah sorry I read it wrong, I thought it said sell your wallet. Doh. No in that case. Public key is fine
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:38:07
Yes the catch is to make limit orders which are zero fees and market orders are 0.2%
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:49:15
It's where you set what price you pay and then the order is standing until Btc hits that price. 
So set the price just below the market price and wait for it to go through. 
A market order just matches you with the current price which is why it takes a 0.2% fee.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:28:19
If you select Kucoin as the exchange and the trading pair when you purchase on delta it will add the current market price for you

Sing up as a vendor on the darknet sites if it's illegal
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:05:42
Yeah don't fret shit happens. I had £800 worth of BTC back when it was at £2 each but used it all on Silk Road: fast forward to today and the shit I got was nowhere near better than the £100 million I could of had before Xmas��
On another note though, try the Revolut app as can do Sepa transfers which arrive same day so no need to wait a week to transfer and but tg beloved btc
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:30:19
If sold and they pay you money sure let them have it but not until!
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:11:11
No need for an advisor. Just buy now! We've past the FUD and Chinese New Year! Now the only way is up!
Although maybe put 4K in BTC and spread 1k over some infrastructure blockchains like Lisk, Ven etc
Donation of profits welcome instead of fees ;)

Try Carebit Masternode, huge ROI even though it's supposed to be a charity coin
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:49:13
Here's a charity worth investing in. Returns of £899 if running your own masternode:) 
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:52:06
Me too bro but now on to a winner! Forget Ico's, check out masternode coins! In 7 weeks I've made +10k as well as my initial investment doubling in value 
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:16:20
Thanks bro! Yeah of course there's always risks with every Crypto which is why I mine more than investing in them but still been a great turnaround since my portfolio from December 
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:04:00
Post a pic of it and let's see how we can always help!:P
That's a joke too btw! Don't post that anywhere online!
