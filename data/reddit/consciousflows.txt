This guy doesn't give up even when he has been exposed so many times. He has no shame whatsoever.

I don't understand how their orders work. I saw buy BTC at 8600 and then sell at 8200. Since they're quoting from multiple exchanges what explains the large gap?

That shouldn't fly too well in a community where freedom of expression and community driven consensus is at the heart of its values. When some actors are seen as bad by the majority does it justify a ban? At what point does that view become a tool for censorship and control?

You mistyped unfounded

A lot of replies in this thread supporting inflation starts from within the paradigm we are in and falsely assumes it is "the healthy system". It's the economy we live in that is based on debt, constant spending and constant resource extraction that is putting complex life on this earth in jeapordy. 
Is bitcoin perfect? No. But it's one part of much larger systemic changes that need to happen for society to function for the WE over the ME.

So you're measuring progress by price? Bitcoin has progressed immensely in the last 10 years. Posts like this make me sad but I guess the last run up brought in a lot of "moon bros". Which is fine because more people following this project is great.  But really price is really the least important metric for success.

I think every week that clown predicts a new price target to help his investments. He took a proud selfie with Roger Ver so yea....

Bitmain is shady AF. Anyone who invests in their ipo either has no values or is ignorant of their history.
