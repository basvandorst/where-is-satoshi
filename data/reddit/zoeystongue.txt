I’m sorry for your loss. My wife and I lost our son 3.5 years ago and every day is still tough. Make sure you are there for her as much as you can be, be a good friend, good listener, and a good father.  Don’t be afraid to express your own feelings as your wife unfortunately is now the only other person in this world that can truly understand your loss.  There are no words I can type to make you feel better or that will make it right but I know he will always be loved. 
A few quick notes
Holidays will always be hard going forward, I’m sorry. 
You will find some of your friends get it and you will lean on these relationships, however some just don’t get it. Those that don’t can say shitty things &amp; these are not truly friends, the faster you can separate from the latter the better. 
Go give your wife a hug for my family.
