Arcbit, now featuring stealth address support. Bip39 and reusable payment addresses. Better than samurai, only on ios
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:34:01
This has to be a scam
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:00:51
This smells like a 4chan post. It's too bad this isn't in green.

Same boat!!!
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:37:44
Was i right?
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:50:43
Seconded. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:04:56
SOOO i though i had read cryptsy is not to be trusted lately, what's the deal?
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:17:57
Can you report this post to the mods? I feel weird about this.. PayPal? Instantaneously? Really?
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:06:33
Bitcoinltd.net also seems super sus
@_date: 2015-12-27 20:50:04
I opened an account the other day to buy and i got the same thing. Infuriated with what was "instant" i contacted support and just said: "either you give me my money back (which you have already withdrawn from my account) or you send me my bitcoin, if i do not receive a response within 24hrs i will be contacting the bank to claim you are a fraudulent company and then preparing the necessary information to submit a claim to the better business bureau." Got a response within an hour and the coins with the response from support.
@_date: 2016-01-13 13:38:45
Agreed. That's was a wonderful explanation.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:31:09
I dont understand, so if I say had 100btc, what would happen when the fork occurs, hypothetical btc being stored in cold storage on a trezor. Do I have 200 then?
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:30:21
Yes, mostly p2p trading over the last 2 years. Recently got onto poloniex and started playing with eth, fct, and emc(livecoin.net) its all about due diligence and researching the coin before you make any bets.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:18:55
I have recently achieved cumulatively 100 because of the price swing, now i don't know where to go. I'm thinking alts now. ETH is looking good on polo
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:33:35
An ELI5 would be cool too if possible.
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:13:17
Spread that image like wildfire. Too funny
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:33:24
Favorited that video. New favorite.
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:32:47
THIS is what I have been WAITING for. Fungibility is back baby~~~
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:33:08
Now I just need the alpha update to roll to my phone :o
@_date: 2016-06-08 23:58:55
Clooooooooooose indeed, you ready for takeoff?
@_date: 2015-08-31 06:47:34
100% this
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:09:21
I like the sound of this. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:59:00
Hahahahaha trueeee
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:43:25
Slick wallet. Too bad i couldnt paste and address into the send bar. I had to scan a qr code. And while that's not a huge deal what if i had a paper wallet, it can't read written words. Cmon man.
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:34:23
I too have a YouTube channel, trezor, HW.1 and a ledger wallet.  I'd love to review the keepkey and be an affiliate, many people i know have been drafted into hardware wallets by me so I'd love to take a review on it.
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:23:52
Samourai and sentinel are life. I trust them. Their vision. And code. Have been a supporter since alpha enrollment was availible. Haven't lost a single satoshi. I literally refuse to use any other wallet. The hidden dialer feature is insanely unique.
@_date: 2015-09-12 07:23:21
I'll second you for the sake of that address my good sir~
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:30:25
Am interested to see what people suggest.
@_date: 2015-09-25 10:53:32
That's how I look at it too!
@_date: 2015-09-25 10:34:24
I have 100 coins invested that I picked up at 180$ over a year ago. I truly believe in it. And if anything I can keep cashing out during highs and waiting for dips. If you look at the trends its an upward trend with dips. It's bound to at least keep going up and down between periods of stabilization.
@_date: 2015-09-25 10:47:16
Well that trend is strictly going up so therefore it must crash soon yes?
@_date: 2015-09-25 10:48:37
But if all those dollars are being generated exponentially then the USD is just loosing its power, maybe not here but to all other countries, no?
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:50:49
Interesting, so I should just count my blessings then, huh?
@_date: 2015-11-10 06:27:08
Pm me too please :-)
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:49:50
So, Google the samourai wallet alpha, and request to be a tester via Google plus. Then you can scoop the apk. If you can't get it pm me and I'll send you the apk file.
@_date: 2015-11-08 07:35:04
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:58:49
It's secured, can you pm me why I needed to move them? I put them on my other trezor!
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:39:19
Hahahaha you silly
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:37:57
See that's the thing. It's my cold storage trezor. I never give out addresses for that. And they are deterministically made since I'm using HD
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:09:47
Android use samourai wallet for spending. And use sentinel for watch only of your cold storage wallets. I swear by these 2. Samourai also can fully obfuscate your transactions. As well as bundle with coinjoin transactions to further make your tx untraceable.
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:55:55
You will not regret using this wallet. You can even remove the icon from applications and your launcher and set it to launch from your dial pad by typing **xxxx and hitting dial. Very sneakyyyyy
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:03:06
Yes, the amount.
@_date: 2015-11-08 07:34:49
Pics or that totally did not happen
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:19:46
Wow nosey boys, but really I just wanted to figure out how it could have happened. I don't have many friends. And none that have sent me coin before. Like I said, not to my cold storage wallet at least.
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:52:39
Then color me confused..
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:54:55
Did any technological advance become a world phenomenon overnight? Think the Internet. Remember aol cds? There were people that were not aware of what the Internet was for a very long time.
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:53:15
This.. Go big or go home. I'm balls deep in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:12:17
Well I've diversified my wealth accordingly. I'm no dingus, but I believe in the technology and that it will be successful
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:54:24
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:03:59
No this was a substantial amount of coin. No message attached. According to block explorer the transaction was swept from over 40 addresses.
@_date: 2015-10-26 04:38:03
Holy smokes, these guys are SO desperate they will do anything for money, our government is SO sleazy..
@_date: 2015-10-07 14:14:33
Im not sure what any of the perks of using this site are? Can you use bogus details to register and participate?
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:33:08
Much better security in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-10-08 05:14:25
Insensitive really...
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:02:41
I too try and spend with my bitcoin. I try to support the BTC ecosystem. I have a cold storage for my hopes and dreams. And a small wallet I use when coin is up to spend through gyft when the value goes up. I love it. Instant gift cards to so many places. I love it. I have tried to get btc debit cards but they have insane limits like 200$ total can be spent with it. I need a better way. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:03:10
Every time I see threads like this, I just think of this video...
"The real reason I keep this bitcoin here.... Is the real reason I keep this bitcoin here, is that it is a reminder, that DREARSHS are still possible"
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:27:55
That place looks BEAUTIFUL
