Thank you for the reference - this is the best explanation I have seen for power law valuation metrics (Metcalfe and n log) and bitcoin so far. I am not sure why it needs to be either or. When valuing equity securities we often use top-down (industry trends, comparable deals) and bottom-up (Discounted Cash Flow) approaches together to triangulate a range of values.
To your point, power law valuation are very helpful in determining how the growth of the network will translate to increased value, but is limited in its ability to pin down an initial starting point. If you don't tie the value at any point in time to the specific utility, it is hard to distinguish between one network with n nodes and another. For instance I would argue that the bitcoin network with 100k daily users is already more valuable than Snapchat with &gt;100 million active users because of its particular utility.

If you download spreadsheet you can use your own assumptions. The blue bolded numbers are the original assumptions but you can try your own to see what you get.

Will definitely revisit supply assumptions for next iteration to better account for lost coins.
I implicitly include M2M and B2B in the Other category with black market activity since they are less established at this point.

I will definitely revisit the assumptions around the proportion that are held long-term and how those are likely to evolve. Thank you for the reference to the discussion.
