Thanks, working on it.

+25 doge verify
I'm mining about 200 doge / day with a crappy Mac Mini just for fun. It's not profitable if you pay for electricity but it's possible.
It's also possible to mine for a marginal profit on AWS if you really know what you're doing. It's really involved, and probably not worth it unless you want to know the ins and outs of working with spot instances.

Or encrypt your paper wallet with BIP 38, and keep the passphrase separate from the wallet.

That's actually a misconception. See:
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:36:26
Yes, I've used it. It's a bit too complex for my taste, and it requires using a browser. Even though I haven't added BIP38 yet, I was inspired to write this because of this post:

Worth reading, it's very clever. I wrote a Java implementation following the draft, if you're interested:

You could argue that a browser is a program designed to connect to a server and send data to the internet. It keeps caches and a history. The cold computer may connect to the internet at some point, and you don't know 100% that the browser will never send any data  back. Why use a browser if you don't have to? 
I wouldn't say it's a significant disadvantage, it's more of a philosophical point than anything else.

It's java's SecureRandom API, which uses /dev/urandom on Unix. This is better than DIY entropy generation.
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:47:32
No, it isn't. Been programming since 1983, hardly a noob. Read about /dev/random / urandom and its sources of entropy. See if you can do better.

The actual public key is a point in an elliptic curve. It's either 33 or 65 bytes (depending on whether it's compressed or uncompressed). The hash is 20 bytes, so it saves space in the blockchain.

It would be easier to boot a LiveCD on a computer without a hard drive, just to make sure nothing in the RAM filesystem gets written anywhere. I suppose that if I were storing a life-changing amount of money into a paper wallet, I'd probably use a cheap printer and securely destroy it afterwards. You can get a decent printer for $50 these days.

I find it hard too believe. How can a person write like non native speaker about his hobby, making mistakes in the grammar, and then change to other personality where he writes like an academic? It will take too much efforts to make the ocasional mistake in spelling that does not look obvious or forced and makes it seem that the person is foreign.
It took me a significant amount of effort to write the preceding paragraph. Perhaps I could get used to it, but it would take an enormous amount of practice. Let's say it's doable: you practice and become really good at writing in "foreign English" as a second language. Why would you use the same name for both online personas? *THAT* makes absolutely no sense. If it were me, my nom de plume for a cryptography forum would be something like Peter Lundberg or Michael Brannigan. I'd shoot for something that matched dozens of LinkedIn profiles. There is no good reason to obfuscate your writing while using your real name.

Many people thought \[long list of things that never amounted to anything\] were important.
They were obviously wrong.
Survivor bias is a bitch.

I sent you a PM yesterday about a deposit I made 15 days ago. I would appreciate it if you could acknowledge it. Thanks.

Cashed out? Bitcoin is a currency. When the dollar goes down relative to other currencies you lose purchasing power if you travel abroad. When bitcoin goes down relative to your local currency you lose purchasing power locally.

It looks like someone [just donated]( possibly because of this post.

The best "advice" is to think of bitcoin as another asset in a diversified portfolio, and rebalance your portfolio once in a while. Do you hodl enough bitcoin? Too much? Not enough? Same question about cash, stocks, whatever. Rebalance.

The rules of this experiment don't make sense. If you travel around the world with USD bills, there will be countries where people will be happy to take them at a fair exchange rate (that was the case in Argentina ten years ago, for example). In other countries, you'll have to exchange them for local currency if you want to spend them. Refusing to do so even though it's trivial (and insisting to only shop where people will accept your USD) just would be silly.
Furthermore, planning to start living on Bitcoin for a week *exactly at the time when your monthly rent is due* makes even less sense. It's just like a silly premise for a reality show.
I understand the intention, which is making readers aware of the current state of Bitcoin as a currency. Forbes has to call it an experiment in order to make it sound serious, but it's really just a stunt.
Edit: aware

Get one [here]( I'm using Bitcoin-Qt, there may be better ones.

Here's one guess: BTC is a currency. Some people are taking payments in BTC, but they don't necessarily want to hold BTC. Some surely need to convert BTC to their preferred currency asap. If most buyers cannot access their accounts, that causes an excess of supply.
Edit: can you explain the downvotes? Do you have a better theory?
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:08:54
No, but at least it buys an appetizer.

Watch this video, it explains how to set up Armory to create and use an offline wallet.
