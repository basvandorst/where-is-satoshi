Open Transaction looks like it could help people in my situation. Its good this is thought of but unfortunately not of use now.
You say its possible to conduct cash + remotely as two options. How would one go about this if I picked a secure seller. Simply contact them and ask if I can send a money order or cash envelope?

I've always purchased (registered) money orders through my bank. I'm not sure my local post offices customs, I hope the are the same. Frankly even if they require ID its MUCH easier to get a local friend to go pick up some on my behalf instead of getting someone several hours away that is more of an acquaintance to go purchase coin for me.
I think this method will work very well. I'm still at work but will read up more on campbx as soon as I'm home. I dont think $1000 limit will be an issue I'm not purchasing anywhere near that amount at a time.
Thanks again, it really is appreciated.

I asked this in another forum but felt very attacked for the need to do this anonymously.
I'll check out localbitcoins. I did not see this one yet for some reason. I'm not exactly in a major metro area but hopefully I can find someone within a reasonable driving distance.
*edit: I cant select in-person cash. I tried a few cities (Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, Montreal). Any ideas why this might be? edit2: Never mind, if I put in cities in the location area and hit enter I see different cash sellers under Buy bitcoins with cash

Yes sorry I didnt mean to imply I would use bank money orders. Only that bank money orders are my only experience to date and they always ID me.
I've looked a little into CampBX during breaks in wor but not much as its from my mobile. I didnt get a chance to stop by the post office before closing but I'm going to go in the morning and test a $70 order to cash and see how that goes without ID.

I'm rural. Our population is 100k spread over hundreds of km. The closest urban center that has anything associated with bitcoin (a single seller) is 300+km away. Thats 5-6 hours on winter roads.

BTW I've considered metals. Gold is out of reach. Silver is not, but in small quantities is inflated. I can purchase token amounts at the post office though for starting at $10 up to at least $200 (likely more). The inflation rate is pretty bad though at 15-50% (!) depending on the coin or format. Still, I do plan to ALSO take this route.

In person meeting is almost promised to be a day trip including return. For my quantities and frequency its not worth it on gas alone.
For pre-paid credit cards locally they take ID, and if I'm not mistaken some stores dont allow them to be bought in cash (could just be a local thing, we have few choices, and not many carry this in a usable form..lots of calling cards though).
Selling things would be enormously expensive due to shipping, and its a big loss. I'm planning to mix up savings with silver (maybe gold, but its out of reach for now) but these are Canada post purchased coins, even the basic ones are marked up. But still, less loss compared with reselling goods.
I think hey_wait_a_minute's suggestion will work for me. I'm going to read in more detail tonight and try it out if it fits.

2 of those are 5+ hours away unfortunately. I'm checking localbitcoins now.
*edit: Locations for cash sellers not much better. Val-d'Or QC is a good reference for distance I'm looking at here. Nothing local, its a day trip.
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:09:18
I do. Its going to be a bunch of small transactions though (&lt;$50 each for most) every few weeks/months. I could perform a few purchases this way but it might get old for them fast.
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:20:07
This is great. From the sounds of what you are telling me this is EXACTLY what I'm looking for. Its pretty late and I have early appointments. But I'll check this out first thing AM.
Thank you very much.

Rural, nobody in practical driving distance (its a day trip return) uses craigslist. I'm not even sure our area has a section.

I want to conceal the acquisition of the bitcoins.

Not from the court; I would not lie to them. But my exwife is not the court, just someone who sees my tax returns (so account interests and other factors that give away) and who can petition the court to make an order for adjustment. My order is not automatically fixed to my income or assets. Bitcoins would show up of course as a gain (income or capital I guess) but only upon sale. When that happens she will long be off the list of people who sees my tax return.

I'm north of Val-d'Or, QC Canada. I've no doubts I've seen the cards available in Ottawa and Montreal and maybe North Bay too. Its a pretty big trip though.
My real visa allows me to create prepaid visas (virtual, just the number, or card shipped). But these are just for protection of purchases and tie back to the real card for all transactions. Like a temporary number or alias.
