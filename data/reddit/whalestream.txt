... because they have less regulatory power...
I live in the 3rd world, if my country could regulate they would but they simply lack the manpower and infrastructure to do so.
Makes me appreciate my corrupt, useless “public servants” a little bit.

It’s not because were “under-banked”, it’s because were dirt poor and the money that is left is being claimed for tax.
It’s because were looking for new ways to earn an income and it’s because were looking for a global currency that isn’t tied to our own local currency. 
The unbanked people in my country can’t afford internet to be able to Google Bitcoin. If you believe OP’s narrative you have some serious soul searching to do. 
(It’s ironic that Bitcoin can hardly be called a currency but that’s a different topic)

Good. Sanctions are more effective in harming the general public than they are in swaying politicians.

Competition really. 
BCH is BTC’s biggest competitor...  and we must obviously slay the enemy /s

You use to be able to mine BTC on your laptop. 
You can thank Blockstream for the f-up.

This story is so blown out of proportion it’s not even funny.
This can and does happen to anyone in South Africa with any and everything of value. It was not ‘cause mah bitcoin!’, he was just another fool that got scammed in the worst possible way.
