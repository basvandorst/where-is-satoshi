Let me know if you like the site. It looks promising.

You should probably buy now so when it hits 10 you'll make some coin instead of buying at 10 and having it drop back to 7-8.
@_date: 2012-01-27 01:54:24
I don't see it dropping any further, so yes buy.
EDIT: guess I was wrong.

So I pay $99.45/73.95 per year for 100 MH/s.
At the current price that should yield about $137 per year.
Thats a $37.55/63.05 profit/year (assuming prices don't change much).
Sound worth it?

The bet says that it will be over 13 by the end of the day Friday, not the price will reach 13 before Friday. 
@_date: 2012-05-27 00:54:21
It'll take a fuckload of coins to manipulate it at this point.
@_date: 2012-01-25 19:27:45
Sorry to brag but I timed it perfectly.

HE ALREADY HAS 7,000 BTC!

Bets of Bitcoin is the real deal. I've used them plenty of times and they're great. You can just come up with a bet and make commission on it. If it's good enough you can actually make some good money on a bet commission. Never had any problems.

I have the weirdest boner right now.
@_date: 2012-01-18 00:34:13
Not bad for 30 minutes.
@_date: 2012-01-11 20:12:18
What's the catch?
@_date: 2012-10-04 12:02:20
Bad bet, weekend dip my friend.
@_date: 2012-01-25 22:27:13
What is bitbullbear?

To be honest it was just a lucky guess. I have a tracker on my iPhone that I check every 5 min. I'm starting to notice patterns, but BTC is unpredictable. 
@_date: 2012-09-29 03:31:33
Beef Jerky sounds great.
@_date: 2012-12-11 15:31:35
Already at spot 19.
@_date: 2012-11-07 14:10:36
I'm having trouble registering. Everytime I click register it opens a page with weird cat pictures saying "there was an error". Anyone else get this?
@_date: 2012-01-21 20:28:39
I'd absolutely love to help but know nothing about making a website, so I would be useless. The only thing I'd be good at is making a logo or graphic design.

If you have an iPhone you can get Bitcoin Ticker. I check it every hour and it's free.
@_date: 2012-05-18 03:30:12
The claim page isn't working for me.
@_date: 2012-05-16 13:23:56
I'm thinking it had something to do with Bitcoinica. Maybe people got scared and started moving their money around.
@_date: 2012-01-16 02:15:40
It'll still take them like a week to get bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-01-21 16:38:05
I really like this idea, yes it's risky though.
@_date: 2012-05-26 20:33:59
Stability is boring.
@_date: 2012-12-02 04:03:07
Trust and transparancy.
