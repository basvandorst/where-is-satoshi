Philosophically the concept is applicable to both when you think of them as 'assets', a TV is an asset you can swap for cash, cash is an asset you can swap for food. If you asset value is decreasing over time it is deflating.
Food is an asset that devalues very rapidly (because it rots) but you need it so you swap more stable assets for it. People need houses so they will swap whatever assets they have for one.
The value balancing power of a free market economy has proved itself over and over.

Excellent analogy

That's a pretty cool idea. Especially if it is a Mac with that clever magnetic power cord. However, I imagine the Feds were savy enough to grab him rather than the laptop, as they probably ran through all such 'instant lock-down' eventualities.

Good old snatch and run still works in this digital age. I love bitcoin, but I think it is only truly secure if you are rainman and just remember all your keys...

Don't tell me what to ignore. Have an upvote :D

That's not really what I was implying at all. I said that there was a similar problem with fiat money, and a solution was invented called interest. I am saying someone will inevitably figure out a similar elegant solution to make lending money a worthwhile venture.

I don't have a comprehensive answer, and it is a brain tickling question :) but I have a thought to consider. 
If there was no money system at all, and you were to propose the current system we have, the same question you asked would be asked in reverse, i.e. "If the buying power of £100 was to decrease over time (inflation), then surely banks would never lend money to fund new businesses/home buyers etc. because over time you would essentially owe the bank LESS than what they originally gave you..."
The answer would be: "Well they just offer a contract where they increase the number of £'s that you owe them back over time to (at least) keep up with the VALUE they lent you originally, (plus a little extra to make it worth their while).
I don't see a technical reason why a similar solution would not be invented to tackle this mathematical issue. People are good at making money from number games!

Although I did once read about this system where you replace all numbers with letters, e.g 5=L (Because L is 50 in Roman numerals, and you hand makes an L shape when you hold up 5 fingers. 8=B because it looks like a B etc.).
Then when you have a long number to remember, you swap out the numbers for those letters (Consonants), and fill the gaps with vowels to make words, then visualise the words, and remember the string of images.
It sounds convoluted, but I was surprised how quickly I could memorize significantly long numbers, and do the translation quickly.

That is technically what an Escort is, but hookers often use the title because it is a legal profession, and sounds better than 'fuck for cash woman'. 
Also actual escorts tend to fuck their clients after 'escorting' them for a suitable large tip.

Sounds like you could see more than her gears turning.

Brilliant idea :)

Well I have no legal or financial expertise, but I assume they are concerned how you got the money originally.
Cash for working as a waiter -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; Electronic fiat for payment.
Cash for selling drugs -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; Electronic fiat for payment.
If you only specify the bitcoin, that doesn't satisfy their money laundering concern.
Even if you tried to pay for a house with cash, they will want to know how you came to own the cash.
Bitcoin is basically a currency, so if the conversion rate went up you should specify where the money came from originally, when you bought the bitcoin, and by how much has it gone up.
To reiterate, I have no legal or financial expertise, this is just my very basic understanding of anti-laundering laws.

I like how a self employed woman, getting money for pleasuring herself, who made her own website, and has the smarts to dig for free advice and assistance from a bunch of porn &amp; bitcoin fanatics, is playing the 'I'm just a pretty dumb  girl' card. ;) Smart. I like your style.
