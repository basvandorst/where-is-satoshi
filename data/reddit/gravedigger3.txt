One of these is not like the others.

Pretty sure BTC will always have value, as a collectible if nothing else.

Bubble. Noone is using this shit for anything other than speculation.
When ether is being used for something other than these ICO pyramid schemes then maybe it will be worth something.

I'm right there with you buddy. I traded most of my ETH for BTC when ETH hit $395 and BTC was around $2600.
Left enough in so that if it continues to moon I won't feel too bad, but cashed out enough so that if the bubble popped tomorrow I wouldn't care.
I'm a bit worried about the upcoming drama with BTC though, and over the coming days I will move a good chunk of my BTC into other projects that have a chance of surviving a BTC/ETH crash.

Hahaha, maybe 6 years ago. And even then that is hyperbolic in the extreme.

If you bought more recently than that out of speculation then you deserve a smack of reality.

I remember looking at the housing market 5 years ago and thinking "well, this is obviously a bubble". Most intelligent people were saying the same thing during the dot-com bubble (well before it burst).
Sure a bubble isn't always so obvious.... but this is one of those times where it seemed anyone vaguely familiar with economics and history should have been able to put 2 &amp; 2 together. 
I'm not trying to come off as "holier than thou" so much as expressing my amusement at this lack of common sense and the rage and surprise it is causing. Nobody who understands Bitcoin should be surprised by its volatility, and if you invested in something you didn't understand then you have no one to blame but yourself.
The fact so many people are apparently surprised by this crash shows me that a good number of people are investing in something they don't understand.

I mean if people bothered to look at a chart showing BitCoin value over a year, or even a few months, it was obviously a bubble.
If people jumped on the bandwagon in the last month, with little understanding of what they were getting themselves into, then they have gotten a good life lesson in return for their money. They have no right to complain IMO.
