I've noticed more and more digital currency exchangers dealing in bitcoin - the kinds of company that currently deal in liberty reserve and pecunix, etc. 
The bitcoin exchange companies (ie: exchanges that came from this bitcoin "community") are soon going to face competition from these established e-currency dealers.

In the current system it's possible to make a loan of USD at market interest rates, be repaid in full + your interest and still lose a lot of value (due to under reported inflation).. in fact that's probably the case for most loans that are currently being made. 
While bitcoin is increasing in value there may not be many people willing to make loans - unless they are very comfortable with the level of risk they're taking.. but why should that be bad? The price of bitcoins can't go up forever.. people who have profited will eventually start to worry that the price will go down and start loaning or selling their coins.
I don't think it's a good situation where free money is being loaned out by the central banks to create asset bubbles.. it essentially allows people who can get access to cheap loans to gain free value by shorting the USD (taking a loan and buying other assets and waiting for the inevitable price increase vs. the USD). 
Think of it like this.. the current USD system allows people to profit by hoarding non-monetary assets - notably houses - which is extremely detrimental to young people who consequently can't afford them. If we flip this around so that there's more saving/hoarding in 'money' then people will have less money but everything balances out in the end and prices will be cheaper.
Why would anyone ever sell a house? The price is pretty much guaranteed to always go up forever.. sure there will be slumps along the way but so would there be with the value of bitcoins. People still sell houses.. people will still loan and sell bitcoins.
