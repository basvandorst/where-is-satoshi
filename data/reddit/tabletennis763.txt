They may have asked for Skype so they can see that his face matches the IDs he submitted. They are likely paranoid about releasing access to someone pretending to be him. However, I’d like to ask OP if he was able to successfully Skype with them via video call or not.

OP, have you tried posting your issue to Binance’s subreddit? I would suggest you do so (because their staff may not be often monitoring non-Binance subreddits), but keep the title and body of what you post cordial, diplomatic and non-accusatory. Otherwise, it’s likely to be removed immediately. Furthermore, send a polite tweet to the founder of Binance named CZ. He will likely delegate it to one of his staff to handle. **The key is to keep your communication civil and unemotional.** Moreover, you want to stay very patient throughout this process. It’s difficult to follow sometimes, I know, but throughout all of my experience dealing with online customer support, it’s the most effective way to get results. Good luck, and keep us posted on how it all goes.

Hi, can you post a clearer image? It is blurry when I open it, and I’m unable to read the text.
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:53:37
Agreed.

I trust you ordered the hardware wallet directly from the manufacturer, and not from some third-party source? Would hate for you to receive your Bitcoins, and then your Bitcoin wallet gets compromised.
Also, please make sure he sends you BTC, and not an offshoot forked coin like BCH or BSV. Good luck!

No. Read the findings of user “Seeking Satoshi” on Twitter. He explains CSW’s motivations.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:09:04
I’d post this into the Binance Reddit channel, not here. Furthermore, I’d contact their online support immediately to report this.

Darn it! I wish I read this 10 minutes ago. ��

You can access the Bitcoin network via satellite now, too.

Bitcoin can’t scale, said a misinformed asshole somewhere. Craig Wright is Satoshi, said a paid nChain shill. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, said an old man who drinks rat poison as an after dinner drink.

Google.com should yield articles from reputable sources on the matter for your state/country. However, be very diligent in your research before you transmit money anywhere. There are a lot of scams. Good luck.

This is why you buy a hardware wallet:

If it’s not that often (e.g., monthly), just set up a calendar reminder on your phone and you can do the purchase manually.

Kleiman wasn’t Satoshi. CSW just made that whole story up.

Hey, which tin foil hat do you recommend people purchase?

Sounds like a made-up story in order to spread the malware link he posted in there.

It’ll become more ubiquitous in time, if the demand grows (just like with all technologies). Rome wasn’t built in a day.

I am Satoshi.

Where are all the BCash people who like to say “LN doesn’t work!”? I wonder what they’re saying now, lol.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:56:47
Kleinman wasn’t sophisticated enough to be Satoshi. CSW picked him because they’d worked together before, and because Kleinman died, it was easy to invent a story about him afterwards that couldn’t easily be refuted. CSW has a habit of making up grandiose stories about people after their death.
Off topic, why did you remove the body text in your post?

Excellent article, Phil. Thanks for writing it. Misir did a great job on his podcast.

I’m sorry to hear this. I’m sure you’re kicking yourself for not properly vetting HitBTC (by reading various user reviews about them, etc. which tend to be mostly bad) before using them. Otherwise, you would’ve chosen to work with a more reputable exchange like Binance.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:55:18
Agreed 100%. Murad says the same thing in his podcast with Pomp. Currently, Bitcoin is mostly just a collectible, and a store of value. Later, it will enter the latter two stages.
@_date: 2018-07-13 18:13:00
The article wouldn’t load for me for some reason. However, I’m going to take a wild guess and say say that the Reddit title may need some tweaking. I don’t think a “physical” bank can be decentralized. How would that even be possible?

I hope you’re right.

Please tell us so some good can from this and we can learn from your mistake.
No need to feel embarrassed. Nobody here knows you.

Time, mistakes and reflection have made you wise. May you live long and prosper. ��

We’ll see what happens. People are predicting a recession soon with the stock market because it’s been a bull market for some time now. Do you think a stock market recession would help or hinder crypto prices?

I’m not sure if there is a reason for the latest drop. Sometimes there isn’t a reason, and it’s just random.

I just viewed his Twitter and see nothing about him being a Trump supporter. Can you kindly show us **proof** of this? Thanks.
