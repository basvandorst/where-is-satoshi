If it makes you feel any better, I spent 15k on ETH when it was $400... In April.... And then thought I had basically lost most of my money when ETH dumped to $150. It eventually rose to $300 where it stagnated for months. But look at it now!  In crypto, if you get the timing wrong initially, all you need to do is delete blockfolio, forget about crypto, and resume your normal life. Revisit in 3 months, then again at 6 months. Do not sell at a loss.

How did you cash out? I have made some money in crypto (nowhere near as much as you) but I'm worried about banks closing my account if I try to withdraw back into fiat. Did you encounter any problems? I'm also in the UK.

So you're assuming he'd have just given you his profit? Not sure why his savings has any relevance to you. Give yourself a break, yes he would have made money but probably would not have shared it with you, so you have nothing to worry about.

I own BCH and recently bought a Trezor a couple of weeks ago. Is it safe to 'send' BCH to the trezor? I usually hold on exchanges due to a limited understanding of how offline wallets work. So many stories of people hitting the wrong button when fiddling around with their wallet then poof, all their bitcoins disappear.

To use CNY in your own local area you would need two banks. First, a bank that can 'clear' CNY for you and any such bank ultimately would be situated in China. Second, your bank in your local area to transact in the CNY who may then have customers using the CNY for various reasons, like one customer may be operating an exchange in your example, perhaps. Your local bank would be the known as a 'correspondent' bank. China will know exactly what's happening with their CNY you can count on that. The 'clearing' bank in China will have many regulations, say,  reporting requirements unique to China, and can turn off the tap to CNY clearing whenever they please, stopping the flow of CNY to their customers i.e. The correspondent banks in your local area...Then as a corporate customer of the correspondent bank, your exchange suddenly has no access to CNY clearing anymore.

Stopped reading when you said you've only been in 5 months. I've been in 10 months but wouldn't try to delude myself and others.
