Yes, me and my "liberal" facts will go talk to other people. If you ever decide to stop hating facts because you disagree with them, you should really try watching those "Fake News" stations again, they actually aren't that bad.
Nice job "not backing Fox", you seem super impartial.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:57:47
Yes, it shows how bad Fox News is. Fox makes you less informed, not even Comedy Central does that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:59:23
You to, you will need it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:24:17
The study is real, but good job trying to shoe horn in "Fake News".
Try googling it, you will find an actual study was done. Look into it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:32:33
Fake News!
*also, you apparently cannot comprehend they study, but it wasn't about The Daily Show, they polled viewers of all news station, including NPR. NPR won, not The Daily Show.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:29:04
nope, try again.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:04:05
Listen, I supplied the study showing Fox is worse. It is still plenty recent, and completely valid. Don't get upset just because I called you out, and then provided a literal study confirming my facts, and disproving your opinion. All networks are not the same, and to say otherwise in the face of facts is ignorant.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:48:35
First off, your bias is showing. And it took me 30 seconds of googling... 
You are welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:28:39
No, I can when it is a trusted study. Just like the world at large agrees about Global Warming. Don't be upset that you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:55:17
The world at large disagrees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:41:01
No, they get shit on Reddit because they make people less informed. No one disagrees all networks exist to make money. There is no debate. 
We are talking equality, and with Fox, it is not equal. It is worse.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:26:24
1/3 of Americans still support him despite everything. His support and influence is frighteningly high.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:56:51
Screeching "Fake News" when you disagree with facts doesn't make them less factual.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:54:05
I have a study. You do not. Dont talk shit about my study until you at least have one from your side.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:56:58
Ha, funny, but you could claim that for the USA too! We are all putin puppets!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:37:03
FYI, NPR won, not The Daily Show. You should actually read the article.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:38:38
Jesus, read the actual article before claiming it is fake news, just because you don't like it. And FYI, NPR won, not The Daily Show.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:56:03
Yes, my facts are pretty biased. Oh wait...
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:29:35
No, that is false. Studies have been done showing this. Fox News makes you LESS INFORMED.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:25:12
No, and this is a bad lie to spread. Studies have been done showing viewers watching Fox News are LESS INFORMED than people watching no news at all.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:58:47
Oh yes, those are facts, and you dont get to disagree with them any more than you can rationally believe in a flat earth.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:54:40
No, lies. Fox News makes you less informed. It does the opposite of what news should do.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:57:45
And NPR listeners are the most informed of all. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:28:17
I have family in the South that feel the same way. It is really difficult interacting with them knowing how they feel. Stay Strong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:26:03
Original claim debunked, quick, pivot to a different point and hope no one notices!
Also in the news today, people go to work for money and not out of the goodness of their hearts!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:39:44
Found the Faux News viewer!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:38:59
Do you even have a study to refute my study? Or just gonna pout?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:33:22
Yea, that isn't what the study said. It was about non political world events going on, and if the participants were aware of them, and to what extent.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:38:14
Why is on capitalized, but for (the word is 50% larger than on!) is not? I find this unacceptable. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:55:29

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:58:29
Um, things like countries can't be politicized. Asking who the leader of Syria is isn't political.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:57:48
Those rural people distrust the government. They might not have much money or internet, but there are a lot of them and they are already conditioned to like bitcoin and dislike fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:56:05
Ha! Yea, keep telling yourself that. Fox News...Changed... Bwahahahahahahahhaaaa!
*Don't like facts because you disagree with them? Don't bother asking for them if you are gonna ignore them.

You need volatility in your assets to make money. You adjust your risk by adjusting your investment amount. If it is risky, invest less, but still invest.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:41:17
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:47:58
Yea, this is why Gold isn't used now days and is currently worthless. Too hard to use, fluctuates too much, and not everyone even uses it. Complete scam.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:20:54
I was born mid 80s, i remember the birth of the internet better than you.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:59:41
I agree 100%, but hope his hands stay full with Russia and Mueller. Also, it is Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, named after his daddy, and his daddy before him. And they were named after the President of the Confederacy and a ranking Confederate General.

There are volatile and non volatile stocks, your risk appetite determines your portfolio, much like crypto. If you wanted, you could have a very volatile stock portfolio.

You must have missed the Internet boom yielding Google, Facebook, Ebay, ect.
Remember when people talked about Email and internet and just said "I'm not a computer guy"? Yea, same thing. You don't get universal adoption overnight, and that is why Early Adopters are a thing. There is a whole concept of adoption of technology. We are at the AOL CD and horrible dial up noise zone right now in Crypto.
