So I'm not looking for an Internet argument here, but it kind of feels like you're not really hearing what I'm saying.
@_date: 2016-04-18 08:59:57
Sigh.. Okay, first of all I don't like commenting in this subreddit because as soon as you write something to someone and you don't agree 100% with what they're saying you instantly get put into the opposite camp regardless if you actually hold those views or not.
AGAIN I'm not saying "Oooh-weee look at the graphs, there's definitely a pattern here!"
I'm simply saying that they're both bubbles and that if the underlying reasons for them in the real world are similar that might give you a *hint*, a *parameter*, a *data point* of how bitcoin might act in the future situations (if you dig deep enough and if your methodology is solid and accounts for human nature).
You're ((s)he's?) basically saying that there is no way ever in the world to know anything about anything because we humans see patters everywhere thus those patterns are never to be trusted because it's only a biological illusion and human error in the fist place. I get it, but I think you're wrong.
Staring at graphs; you might as well be staring at goats. But if you go out of your way and read stuff on the internet and in physical printings (e.g. the news, financial reports, etc) released around that time you might come to some sort of conclusion that would help you predict the future just a tiny bit better.
I'm not saying "look at this fucking graph, it looks like the beginning of these fucking graphs" lets bet all our money on this because of that.
I'm saying that if you learn something from this "deeper study" you can incorporate it with your current view of what influences the price of bitcoin. But you have to do it right of course.
You're pretty much saying that there is no correlation between increasing bitcoin prices and capital outflow from countries hit by financial strife, because both events we're looking at have similar graphs? Since bitcoin is basically digital gold which *(A)* is much more liquid than regular gold and *(B)* has a lower capacity than regular gold; is that really that big of a leap of faith to take? Or might it just be interesting enough of a hypothesis to look deeper, even if you end up being wrong?
I personally think that both bubbles had people who wanted to stash their wealth before it got devalued by their governments and sought an easier alternative to gold without understanding bitcoins "max capacity" at those times. I did not draw these conclusions from "looking at graphs", I drew them from looking at events around the world that happened around the time of the two bubbles.
Sure we humans seek patterns, but if the pattern keeps repeating *time after time after time* as it has with the gold price around financial crises then those same patterns may also apply to bitcoin, but in another way because of different parameters between the commodities like liquidity. Do you also ignore the macro-economic cycle when making financial decisions? Because the long- and short-term debt-cycle pattern has been going for over 70 years. Of course not, you have to respect it.
I'm not saying bet money on this. I'm saying it's interesting to think about. It's frustrating AF when your argument gets devolved into "let's stare at graphs together".
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:08:28
What you posted I agree with actually. However while you must surely understand my argument I think you are fundamentally misunderstanding what I'm arguing for.
You think my argument is:
"If you find out what caused these graphs you can find out what will cause similar graphs or patterns in the future."
That is not at all my argument. (But I understand that you think that it is because of the comment I was replying to.)
My argument is:
"Since both patters were tied to similar events it might be *interesting* to find out more about the events and keep them in mind in case something similar happens in the future. (Not to bet money on it, but to keep evolving your understanding of how bitcoin behaves.)"
There just might be a similarity between bitcoin and gold. There is a reason that people invest in gold during economic downturns, and no offense, but to say that the same might not apply to bitcoin because the events tied to some graphs are similar is just bad advice.
5 years from now people who think like that will still be on square 0 when it comes to their abstract model of how bitcoin interacts with the economies of the world. It's like saying "let's not find out more about how the internet behaves because it's too complicated to understand" in the 1980s.
EDIT: And oh my god to say that patterns are useless is simply just false. Sure you can not predict the future with a pattern but if you have 1,000 predictions to make a pattern quickly becomes very important.
Let's say you're playing vs a casino bot that says it's fair (50/50) and you think you know a pattern, because some poor sod played 1,000,000 spins and roughly 49,5% of them he won. This might be a very real pointer to false information, but at the same time in an infinite universe it might also end up being a coincidence. But the chance of this is unfathomably low.
But from what I'm getting you're saying the pattern of 1,000,000 spins is useless because it doesn't predict the next spin well at all. And that is totally true, I would not bet my life on a margin 0,5%. But this is my point: NOW AT LEAST I KNOW IF I SHOULD BE PLAYING THE GAME OR NOT.
Am I wrong here?

Literally because it was the *first* number I thought of. I don't deal with -7500 often, neither do I deal with 54,349,978,234,675,220, 3.2x10^45 or 3.2x10^-45. 1 is probably one of the most common numbers I deal with so it's fresh within my memory and I'm lazy so I don't want to think of a more "random" one. The number never really was random because I'm human and I follow patterns like all other humans.

It's not interesting because of past performance. It's interesting because this means the market has behaved very similarly at two points in time. The reasons might be very different, but if you can pin world events to these patterns maybe, just maybe, you could get a glimpse of insight that would help you make decisions as similar events unfold in the future.
Looking at graphs is not a good way of predicting future performance, but digging deeper could yield more insight. That makes it interesting.
EDIT: I guess both in some way have to do with people trying to escape their governments control of their money, but they can't really make a risk-based assessment of the bitcoin price? So they crowd to the currency not knowing that they are in the process of overvaluing it in the long term. Cyprus played a role in the first bubble, and China played a role in the second. Both populations experienced currency control.

You guys keep doing what you are doing, I'm not even using the HD version and I'm very happy with the Software. Don't let some entitled little shits on the Internet stop you from trying a new business model just because they whine a lot, they are not the majority.

Wow, soon™ the 100,000,000,000,000 bill might actually be worth something as a collectors item.

Oh well, I guess it's alright then.

But then others might make payments into those addresses and how will the program keep track of what is for the game and what is just for charity?

This is really interesting because I'm sure that hashpower comes both from people for and against SegWit and/or Blocksize increase. Basically I think people are voting on the future of Bitcoin with their own resources.
You guys might fight it out all the time, but at least in this aspect it's doing really good things for our network.

For a second there I thought they we're talking about the famous Magic: the Gathering card with the same same.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:58:59
Could you give me an example of how a dynamic block size could be gamed or abused for gain?
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:24:19
I don't think I can come up with a solution here, I'm just not qualified. I'm just trying to understand the problem better by discussing it.
Wouldn't the simplest solution just be to increase the block size to 2 MB? Then when 2 MB gets too small, 3 or 4 MB can be proposed later and consensus will be reached when it is needed. This way resources won't be wasted; which is a problem with arbitrarily doubling the block size every X years, who knows if the networks grows as fast as the block size?
Sure this would be a bigger hassle from an administrative standpoint, but it would also lower the risk of wasting resources. Who knows if we'll need 8 GB blocks in the future? If we only need 1 GB, why make it 8 GB?
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:24:43
Is there any way to make this spam more expensive than the potential rewards?
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:33:48
Hehe, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the pros and cons of every solution. I'm not sure I can "give up" on something I don't fully understand.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:26:16
So if the block size limit is say 8MB that does not mean that all blocks will be 8MB?
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:11:10
Hm.. What if the algorithm was somehow "one-way", so that it could only increase in block size? But instead of being based on some arbitrary time in the future, it would be based on network transactions, but it would have to be designed in a robust way so that a single attacker would have to spend more resources to increase the block size than would be gained from it. Just like double spending. Not sure how this would look though, or even if the same principles applies (maybe it's just much much cheaper to increase transaction traffic?).
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:19:18
I think he means that the pattern before the $1000+ spike is the same as the entire graph now (it is basically repeating itself on a larger scale). Then there was a longer period of stability, then came the $1000 spike.
Not 100% sure though.

Dem amphetamines.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:50:32
I think that miners with limited broadband would be lagging behind and wasting much of their mining power before they "realize" that the block has been mined, also it takes longer time for them to sync up once it has been mined.
So someone could "spam" the system to exclude the smaller miners, forcing the ecosystem to centralize mining with a couple of big central players that can manage that kind of capacity, basically turning bitcoin into PayPal or something.
That's what I've taken away from all this drama anyways, I might not be spot on though.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:13:57
It's like it's 1998 and some dumb newscaster is talking about how a telephone company will destroy the Internet because they just invented their own closed WAN..
But honestly, if is technology the first step towards bank transactions being instant in the future between banks, I don't mind this at all.

Unless this person has control over 100% of hasingpower that would be pretty stupid. It's more like stealing bitcoin and holding a free lottery where you have some of the tickets.
