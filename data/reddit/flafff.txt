yes, cause following the advice of the single guy who got lucky by doing it and forgetting all those who didn't is a little stupid.

You realise lot of people invested when the price was above that, right ? So they are not up anything. Some invested when it was 18k, they are at a huge loss for now.


you have absolutely no idea about that.

The post is about yearly lowest. So for 2019 it will be **at best** 3700

I'm eager to see the point of showing a yearly growth if it's not to show performances. Please tell me?

**Past performance is not indicative of future results** that's like the 101 of investment.

It seemed to go "to the moon" last winter then dropped, it also seemed to stabilize around 6500 then felt at 3500. No one knows what bitcoin will be in the future, it can fall flat or become the money used by every countries and no one knows what the value of it will be.

But... you'd have gained more by pulling off when it was down to for e.g. 800 to buy again when it was going back up around 400.

Yep, trying to invest is only for rich people

For some 1k$ is a lot, for others 100k$ isn't. Those who are sweating the most are not always the ones who lost the most in value.

so that's... precisely what I mean, when says "sorry to tell you but it is just a couple of hundrets. some here are sweating big time :D a couple hundred for a lesson learned isnt expensive at all" It's simply a big pile of crap.
