Do I need anything else like a Bitcoin wallet or anything like that? Is coinbase just for the buying and selling of it?
Also would now be a good time to buy in?

Okay thank you.
I have just got an electrum wallet. I got bread as well but that wouldn't let me do anything on the app so went with electrum instead.
So the QR codes, there is one under receive and one under master public key. Which one does what? As I've seen people showing their QR codes and long addresses. Just so I know what I need to be sharing and not sharing when it comes to transactions.

Okay sounds good. I will have a little play and see how it goes. If I get stuck on anything I'm sure I will come back with more questions. Thank you.

Thank you. You have been a great help.
Just a question though (Sorry, so many), what is the difference then between my coinbase wallet and say my breadwallet. Wouldn't I want to keep it in my coinbase wallet so that it will rise at the moment? (Ofc possibly fall too). When would I want to transfer it to the other wallet if I'm just looking to leave it to grow for a bit during this wave?

Is there a wallet that you would recommend I use?
I'm using the coinbase app on my phone, so maybe a phone based wallet? Or PC wallet, idm.
Also how would that link to my coinbase account? Would they be two separate things?
Sorry if I sound stupid. Just trying to wrap my head around it.

Thank you, I will check it out.

Okay thank you for the advice.

Thank you! I have just set up an account.

So, I've just registered on coinbase and set it all up. It says if I register a bank account number it is for larger transactions, And credit/debit cards have extra fees but can do smaller transactions.
Can you still do smaller transactions if you just do it through the bank account to avoid the extra fees?
Also, as this post is generally about Bitcoin being so healthy right now, would now be a good time to buy in or is it due to go down a bit before it rises?
I haven't really followed it too much so not sure of the trends...

Okay thank you.
The one problem I'm finding is that the bread app is just not doing anything but the security to get in it is nice, and the electrum app is working and has what I need, but it just let's me straight into the wallet even after closing it, no asking for pins or passwords or anything. Which could be a problem.

I've wanted to get into this for ages but haven't got the first clue about how to go about it or where to go to do it without getting ripped off...
I need an ELI5 really.

Yeah but millennials also eat tide pods, so it's not saying much.
