Anyone have a ledger nano s? Can bitcoin be spent from the nano?

Seriously tho, wtf. Get that b.s. narrative out of here.

So we want to become a centralized, household industry? Traded on wall street, big gov't connections?

Do they honor the "official rate" when exchanging from bolívares back to USD?
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:17:31
