Electrum already uses a scheme that lets you convert 12 words (from a small 1600~ word dictionary) to 128 bits back and forth.  I think if a similar scheme were adopted by many people, addresses could be written as words which could be much easier to use, [or potentially written as a combination of words and base58.]

Because the fee market isn't actually a fee market.  The miner of the block receives the money for proof of work, but the cost is more than proof of work, it's also the cost of storing and transmitting the blocks.  This cost is socialized.  
In a tragedy of the commons, miners only have incentive to include every block that has fee larger than the implied cost of orphaning a block, instead of only having incentive to include a block that has fee larger than the total cost of adding the transaction to the network.  This difference is magnified with larger blocks and distorts the market.

Inflation produces more wealth inequality, not less.  Poor and unbanked people do not utilise or have access to investment networks, and their funds more quickly erode over time.

Bitcoin on-chain tx fees will continue to increase for quite some time, but that is okay.  Today, we pay $3 for a $100 credit card transaction.  We pay $100 to wire big sums of money.
People erroneously demand bitcoin to be cheap, secure, fast, decentralized, capped supply, and more.  Bitcoin should focus on the properties where it has a comparative advantage, which guarantee it's widespread use.  $0.20 transaction fees are completely unsustainable in the long run.  As such, and as fees rise to the $2 range (even after segwit), eventually bitcoin will not be used directly for things like buying coffee.  Other layers - including trust-based layers such as Paypal/venmo - can and will be used for these types of transactions.  For example, you could load $50 into a third party account like Paypal to pay for coffee, and they may also offer withdrawal to your bitcoin wallet.
Bitcoin has the ability to skirt legacy banking systems at a core level but does not have a turnkey ability to replicate all levels of financial services, those have to be built out.  They will be built out automatically when possible because of free enterprise seeking a profit, when and as the need arises.

They "believe on-chain scaling is possible" is a charitable way of putting it.  It's about control of bitcoin and it's governance.  Mining is a $7+ billion industry.  If layer 2 stuff actually works, they fear they will be getting a small slice of the pie instead of keeping the whole pie.  This creates billions of dollars of incentive to push against layer 2 technologies. 
 
They also spam the mempool with epsilon-fee transactions to push the argument the blocks are overfull, that's why the mempool disappeared briefly once the segwit fight was over (which makes no sense unless it was manipulated - you would expect it to always increase proportional to users basically).  They claim segwit is a regression so they can continue to use covert ASICBOOST and gain an edge over other miners.

I strongly do not support 2x, but I think the reasons given in this article are not the most convincing reasons. 
The real argument against 2x is to attack: How good is the extra space, the lack of strong veteran developers, and most importantly, the risk of further mining centralization through increased comparative orphan costs.
If 2x really was better, one wouldn't care about replays or how the agreement happened etc., we would just move onto that chain. And (this was basically 2 of 4 points in this memo), every major upgrade is a "fork" in terms of not being backwards compatible, it wasn't explained if the risk is a type of regular risk that happens when you do major upgrades, or if it is added from having a competing chain (which would in theory place the source of the risk as equally from both chains.)
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:19:27
Seems everyone is missing the point.  The Silbert agreement put on paper that those undersigned parties think Segwit is okay.  This is a political problem, not a technical one, and the agreement checkmated those people.

There's not free competition.  The govt subsidizes it with federal deposit insurance.  That's why banks have no incentive to compete in this dimension.  In contrast to crypto, plenty of exchanges provide proof of 100% reserve because it helps bring in customers.
And btw most talk against fractional reserve is incorrect.. fundamentally there's nothing wrong with owing more than you currently have.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:32:06
If you don't understand then you shouldn't be talking shit about "painting false realities."  Szabo is completely correct by using the words "can't" and "need."
First, in a scenario where Bitcoin has strong global adoption, (assuming that there is more than one miner,) the fees would still be very significant, as they are bounded below by the (marginal) orphan risk which is quite high.  Coffee can't happen on chain.  If 1 billion people bought 1 coffee per day it would add 250GB/day to the chain.  They would have to wait ~5 minutes for a block because of replace-by-fee.  That's not beating Paypal.  On-chain BTC is the wrong tool for that job, just like we don't use a bank wire or cheque to pay for coffee.  This is part of what we mean when we say we *can't* do coffee.  To be very clear, we can't do it because of the technical limitations: having to wait ~5 minutes, having to pay much more than $1 to offset orphan costs, and having the network shoulder the cost of storing ~50TB/yr.  The only way we can do this is if Bitcoin becomes a shitty Paypal with a monopoly miner, which is just worse than Paypal anyways.
Now, on-chain space should be capped because of subtle flaws in Bitcoin's architecture not initially perceived.  Bigger blocks have bigger orphan costs, but the risks are not shouldered equally.  As mining is zero sum, miners who are centralized get a comparative advantage, and these miners will always push for bigger blocks at the detriment first to other miners, and finally to users when monopoly or oligarchy is achieved.  Also, issues dealing with running nodes and keeping track of the mempool is not properly addressed because of misaligned financial incentives.
To talk about blockstream as you alluded to, there will always be winners and losers with any policy, but who do users benefit from?  We talk about blockstream making money, but opening the tx malleability gate provides a benefit to users through the flood of companies and protocols that will inevitably come in - all of which users can opt-in freely, which is a strict gain in utility.  Plus, we are talking about high quality standards like github.com/bitcoin, unlike btc1 which seeks to hijack the reference implementation to pursue political instead of technical goals.  Centralized miners have a great incentive to collude and cement power, as perfect competition drives profits to zero, whereas monopoly mining profits a lot more.  Protecting bitcoin from monopoly mining situations will have a far greater impact on fees than any other policy.
Finally the concept of somehow using on-chain scaling to help off-chain scaling misses a sense of proportion.  Demand will increase 100000x where on-chain scaling can only scale 10x (and even that is unsafe.)  Layer 2 solutions will be mandatory for providing more access to Bitcoin.  Models that rely on other companies will be part of those solutions, the way they are for credit cards, Paypal, or even your ISP, and people pay that or decide to trust a company because it saves them time and money.

In my opinion, the subunit in common use should be 1,000,000 bits == 1 bitcoin.
First, SI notation is the wrong direction.
Milli-, micro-, and nano- all give the impression that what the person has is somehow small in value.  
It's also not natural to say in conversation.  People prefer saying "cents" instead of "centidollars."
Second, seemingly unrelated names do not have a strong enough connection.
For example, a finney or satoshi being commonly said may confuse people as to whether these things are actually bitcoin related.
That leaves "bits".  Why 1 million instead of 1,000?  The extra decimal places makes it so you are dealing with fractions of a bit less often, somewhat like pennies.  And 1 million is a nice round number, "nicer" than 10^5 or 10^7 as it is more easily remembered.
Finally, while "bit" itself already has a meaning (as a unit of information), I see this as a minor problem, as it would not be ambiguous (mainly because most people do not refer to bits of information.)

There have been tons of astroturfing shills on some r/bitcoin threads.  Not everyone I disagree with is a shill, but many of these guys are so blatant.  
Go to r/btc and pick any post in the top 10 and look at the history.  Many of them are say, 3 month old redditors, speak with poor English (Chinese?), and nearly 100% of their posts are in r/btc and completely venomous.   
If a regular person is pro BU they would have at least visited r/bitcoin first or made some posts questioning it, instead they just jump to expert-level.

I think 50% of people wouldn't even know which is larger: microbitcoin or millibitcoin.  I used to be on the side of strict SI units but I think now it is just incorrect when we are talking about wide adoption.  It is also awkward to say because it has 4 syllables.  Every currency basically has 1 or 2.  Many people build slang for 1,000 or 10,000 units to keep it easy to say when 10k is a smaller amount in their country.
My comment on satoshis is because I think referring to a millibitcoin as say, 100 Ksat, is worse.
The reason I said it's the wrong direction is because of a psychological barrier where people don't want to get involved unless they can buy one of something.  Minor point.
I agree we can use the prefix of the SI unit, but in practice we would be using micros instead of bits?  I agree with the first part of your conclusion.  I think it would be better if there was a discussion of units and then the community converged on the best options, creating a sort of schelling point.  When mainstream people use bitcoin they can feel more comfortable if there were agreed upon conventions.
I think in applications it is appropriate to say something like "Balance: 1,234,567.89 bits (μBTC)" to reduce confusion.  I think though for the most part, people have already converged onto coins/bitcoins, "millies", and "bits".

Fractional reserve is not the problem, it's the govt lending money at cheaper than market rates, and federal deposit insurance.
Federal deposit insurance makes it so that banks have no incentive to compete in the dimension of proving they are solvent.  Also govt lending money at near zero rates (read: not market) floods the markets with cheap money which pushes prices up and devalues your savings.  Attacking the correct problem helps us not get caught in the weeds arguing about stupid shit.
All fractional reserve is, is that the bank owes more than it has - nothing wrong with that, and private businesses are free to do that.  You as an individual is also free to choose other banks or not deposit your money anywhere.  Or at least you should be free - who even knows nowadays with the war on cash.  
"Money out of thin air" is a meme for stupid people.  If I write you an iou then I've created 'money out of air' too, but who would call for banning ious?

You cant squeeze blood from a stone.  The cost of decentralization - at least with current methods - is very high.  There is a cost for many petahashes of work to be put on top of your son's birthday gift, plus storing and broadcasting the information until the end of time.  Saying you can't use Bitcoin for these uses because lightning network isn't real control, is like saying you can't use a credit card to pay for a coffee because it isn't a bank wire, or you can't use Paypal because it isn't physical USD.  The right tool for the right job.  I don't trust Paypal with $5M, but I'll trust them with $200 because they provide me value in the form of convenience.
You started with what you want instead of what you have.  The reality today is 10 minute confirmation and replace by fee - meaning you will never have instant payments on chain.  The reality is that even increasing the blocks 10x will not offset the 1000000x increase in demand.  Sure, tx's could go from $0.60 USD average now to maybe $0.10 if we increased the blocksize 10x (we don't know what the price will be - just a guess), but the tx fee will just increase again later.  Fundamentally, it is never going to stay below $1 long term.  
Years ago when everyone was ignorant about blockchain tech, everyone sold each other on this idea that you could pay a penny to transact ("frictionless").  With how global worldwide demand is trending, that idea was never going to last.  The revolution is being able to opt out of fiat.  Pushing for bitcoin to become a shitty version of paypal is a low reward, high risk play that threatens this dream for everyone.

No it's not a joke - Bitcoin would still be plenty valuable with $100 fees.  He said for digital gold (store of value) and mid-sized intl remittance.  Also as he said, it would "still be really good if fees were much lower."  But even in a bad case where fees were this high, it is not necessarily a deal breaker for Bitcoin as a store of value and way to settle large debts.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:47:30
That risk is only present in a system of many miners with similar latency to each other.  Very large blocks will push orphan costs significantly higher which makes having a smaller latency to more miners more important, increasing centralization.  Today, 20ms latency difference on a 250byte transaction in a 12.5BTC rewarding block where 1BTC=$3000 incurs a marginal orphan cost of approx $1.22 .  So the cost is very significant.

Not everything is about racism.  Poor English ability is evidence of shilling, because Chinese miners (most of the possible benefactors) are more likely to hire Chinese people to shill.
