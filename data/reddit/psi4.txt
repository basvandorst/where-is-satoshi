That's awesome man. I too was a Ron Paul delegate at the RNC and helped film the video showing the teleprompter that Boehner was reading during the votes with the results shown before the question was asked. It was truly sickening. The secretary wouldn't even announce the votes Ron Paul received as they did the state rolls.

Suggestion: change the text color from white to something darker in the "SIGN UP FOR EARLY ACCESS TO NEW DESIGNS" email field.
I really like the idea and your map designs are beautiful. I'd love to see Portland, OR rendered with your styling.
Edit: Nevermind! Somehow I missed the search at the top of the page and I now see you already have Portland. =P

It looks like I might be a bit late to the party, but I'd love to help out!

Awesome. Thanks!

Especially for substantial changes like this, they should at the very least have a statement at the end of the article stating what was previously erroneously posted.
I'm fine with them correcting minor spelling and grammatical errors if they don't change the substance of the article. However, even for those minor errors, it'd be nice to see an optional changelog so that you can judge for yourself if these minor changes were indeed "minor."

Very sorry to hear. RIP.

I'm sure you've already got this down by now, but if you need free hosting or other help with the webdev end of things for this project, I am at your service free of charge. Thank you for your service to the community!

Yeah, my understanding is that entrapment is more like: "we kidnapped your family and are going to torture them unless you commit this crime"

Fuck political correctness. It's a form of censorship.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:08:52
Not sure. You'll have to be a bit more descriptive.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:49:16
Curiously enough, it looks like it was corrected two months ago by a user who removed the payment:bitcoin tag and then was soon after reverted back with no comment.
@_date: 2014-02-22 08:21:54
No issues here as well.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:52:08
Yeah, it's quite disappointing. I've made a few edits around my local community on openstreetmap and it's always frustrating when people randomly vandalize the hard work you put in to make things more accurate.
Is there a way to flag users for vandalism/spam?
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:45:35
Thanks for adding that note at the end of the article.
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:44:39
haha, I'm in the same boat, though it's been a few days. It's actually supposed to arrive tomorrow.

I've been curious about bitcoin hardware wallets and would like to hear from anyone who owns or is familiar with a Trezor.
* What are your impressions of the device now that it's been out for a year?
* Would you recommend a Trezor?
* Are there any other bitcoin hardware wallets that are released or will soon be released that you would recommend?

If you're planning to make the transcripts freely available, I think [DocumentCloud]( would be an excellent choice.

Two of my favorite people talking about one of my favorite topics. =)

Thanks for reporting from the trial and setting this up. Here's my $1 @_date: 2015-01-05 11:37:13
Has anyone worked on any exciting projects mixing Yubikey hardware devices with bitcoin applications?
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:23:48
Excellent. I just sent a dollar your way.
~~I haven't looked into it regarding court transcripts, but [MuckRock]( is an excellent resource for filing, digitizing, tagging, archiving, and generally making public records available to be easily searched. I've used the resource many times to get searchable copies of FOIA requests, but I'm not 100% certain that they would be able to accept court transcripts.~~ Just heard back and they only handle FOIA related public records that they can track through the entire process.
Also, another option would be Scribd. Though I think DocumentCloud is essentially the same service but is built on opensource technology.

It appears that this video only has audio on the left channel. Otherwise, the volume seemed fine to me.

I prefer the "$5 wrench" title. There's mention of this (with relevant XKCD) in the [Trezor user manual](

I'm sure Mike isn't the only one who is experiencing this problem since others have also posted about it, but I'm not sure that this is likely a significant portion of the current mempool backlog.
If this was a primary or significant cause of the current mempool logjam, wouldn't the fee/size in the mempool have dropped as a result? Here's a [graph of the fee/size of transactions in the mempool over the past 7 days]( from [TradeBlock](
@_date: 2016-03-03 12:12:39
Here's [another one]( that was included in the OP github thread. I have no idea how pervasive this problem is, but it's clearly more than just Mike.
That said, my point above was that it appears to me to be unlikely that this change in the behavior of paytxfee is the source of a significant number of users with transactions stuck in the mempool. This is based on the graph of fee/size over the past 7 days (which includes prior to and during the current mempool backlog) more or less staying constant. If a large number of the transactions stuck in the mempool were due to this paytxfee change, it's my understanding that there would be a drop in the average mempool tx fee/size.
I could be wrong and welcome alternative interpretations.
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:31:42
I agree with both of you. It would be a decent implementation to suggest that users use PGP, and if that's not enabled, fall back to emails only with a generic message like mentioned.
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:44:47
I would imagine that the memory usage would still prevent that from really happening.

Excellent proposal and a much needed addition to Unicode.
I found a minor error in the "Previous submission" section. On page 8-9,


remove the extraneous "and" after the comma.

Nice! Do you think the Raspberry Pi 2 is beefy enough to handle running a full node? I want to setup a full node on a Raspberry Pi-like device as a fun project.

I'm glad you got your money back. Frankly, I'm incredibly surprised that eBay/PayPal sided with you even though you had plenty of compelling documentation. I'd consider yourself extremely lucky.

I just bought some bitcoin from coinbase with no fees and it arrived in my account instantly. Will probably pick up some more later this afternoon when I figure out what I want to order from adafruit.
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:47:37
Adafruit is also offering 10% off their entire store. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:06:53
Yeah. I'm definitely interested.

Here are some risks I can see for a company like Newegg to start accepting bitcoin:
1. Huge XBT/USD price volatility.
   * Alleviated by instantly converting to fiat with a service like Bitpay or Coinbase.
2. Uncertain and/or additional legal/regulatory compliance environment.
3. Need to develop new POS application to accept bitcoin.
   * Again, possibly alleviated by using a service like Bitpay or Coinbase. However, this would likely take a substantial amount of man-hours to integrate with Newegg's cart/payment processing system.
4. Possible risk of negative brand identity. "Bitcoin is used for drugs/crimes".
   * It is ridiculous that people think this, but it is certainly something that the media will try to spin. With a company like Newegg jumping aboard, I think that this risk is very small.
1. Likely to attract new customers, increase sales, and foster positive brand identity without much risk of reducing current customer base. This is especially true now since there are still very few businesses that accept bitcoin, especially those with the kind of brand identity as Newegg.
   * The bitcoin merchant space is still very empty, so Newegg has an amazing opportunity to snatch up a sizable chunk of the market share.
2. Lower/no transaction processing fees.
3. No risk of chargebacks. All bitcoin transactions are irreversible.
4. Receive transaction funds almost instantaneously.

Do you have a kit you're working from?
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:19:54
Yeah. I've sent them a support request on this topic and they claim it is something they are working on. This is the primary reason why I don't use Simple exclusively.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:01:09
Yeah, bitstamp is giving me 500 errors and the API has been down for a bit as well.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:34:10
Thank you for your generosity, +. It's always great to see these kinds of threads, though it's definitely better to see them while they're still active. Dang job and nap. =P
