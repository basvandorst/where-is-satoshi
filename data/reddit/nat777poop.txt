I like your line of thinking. I really do. Yet I bet that any movement of Satoshi's coins would drive markets down to a point where such noble efforts would be vastly diminished.

Yes, you should always be able to get to your coins. I think Trezor and Ledger each use BIP 39 which is a standard codex of words. From your specific words, your private keys and addresses are deterministic.  So if one company goes out of business you could go to the other. I'm no guru - others can comment on how you'd recover by hand in a dystopian world of no hardware wallets.

IMO a Ledger or a Trezor is an ideal solution.

I saw some gems in there.  When playing around I just typed PASSWORD.  I had a laugh

The current setup is a pain, but this release mentioned auto-adding and -removing the device apps as needed

Scrolling through comments here. Have the exact same question. I assume some type of direct connection is needed otherwise no point to IOS apps.

It’s so disheartening that folks keep steering others in that direction with a clear conscience.  I struggle so much with understanding toxic human behavior.

The release mentioned new features to automatically add/remove apps from the device

It cracks me up how everyone gets worked up by a fun picture like this.

Great work.  This is a lot of fun. Love making the car do midair flips.
