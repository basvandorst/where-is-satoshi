Skepticism is good for anything, including Bitcoin. I don't personally like the idea behind Ripple. That doesn't mean it can't or won't make it in the long run. Case in point, Bitcoin.

Bianca also shows confirmation progress too.
Edit: Binance also has this same feature.

Here's my cash. Now how do I get bit coin. If I work for you will you pay me in it? No? Then I guess I'll get a job that pays in fiat and then use that to buy bitcoin. Woah.

And this is why private wallets are the same. Exchanges are just as bad as banks, just more obvious.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:35:10
Right but as he explained GDAX is more fit for that (don't actually know what the difference between would even mean to the bank or how they would view it though).

We had a Hardee's in town that I remember playing in the ball pit of and then they went out of business and reopened as the new Hardee's. I didn't think it sucked really, but it definitely didn't compare.

It can be hacked sure. But then do that to all nodes at the same time. You'd have to have hundreds of operations of hacking you'd have to coordinate at the same time, or at least enough to cover more than half of all nodes(at least if I understand nodes correctly). It's not that it can't be hacked - it's that it is virtually impossible.

Hey, it's me, ur new shitcoin.

Trading was a great way to learn that if I was gonna keep trading and break even by the end of the day, I was better off just investing and HODLing. Now I just HODL and use Binance to aquire alts that I want.

I'm gonna regret saying this because it'll be a minute before I can buy more, but Vechain. I know everyone shills the fuck out of it, but if you can sign up at Binance and buy some, it is worth it. Won't even drop the referral link. Just go to binance.com
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:30:09
But then you also have hundreds of alts who profess a lot of claims with a fraction of the traffic. Increasing Block size isn't a fix all solution. You still run the threat of people saturating your blockspace. This logic applies to other issues too. Bitcoin has the benefit of the name and the adoption rate to make changes while the volume is there. Other coins don't have the same problems Bitcoin has, but Bitcoin's problems are because it's so popular. Things will get fixed in time.

No one should. If you believe in BTC, just hodl. If you have doubts and are leaning towards Ver and BCH, literally just don't see your BTC and just buy BCH. Whether or not you support one or the other, I don't see either currency failing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:25:30
It is when that is the market. People aren't actually using bitcoin yet for obvious reasons(technology barrier of entry, low mainstream adoption yet), so yes things like mining, banking, and trading should be making up most of the commerce. So yes I would definitely assume mining significantly effects pricing based on the cost and difficulty of it.

"Hey I got some legit bitcoin to sell you. Don't worry, it's really real. Well, no, its not the same as the bitcoin you're thinking of, but it's the same code and the names not trademarked so you're basically getting the real deal!"
Yeah that doesn't sound like Matilda levels of scam shit. It should be Bcash, not Bitcoin Cash. Roger Ver did an interview on Dave Rubin and the entire time he talked about Bitcoin and then would tell everyone to go buy "Bitcoin Cash of course." BCash might have a nice mission, but calling it Bitcoin Cash is preying on the misinformed. He knows what he's doing and refuses to even accept the name Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:35
It can still just be fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:02:15
Because part of the value it holds is not just how it is distributed and the anonymity, it's how much it physically costs in dollars to mine. You aren't going to spend $500,000 in electricity and others costs for bitcoin you intend to sell for $5 a piece.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:53:34
Nah I think I actually agree with this guy. It's like an expired coupon, and fortunately with bitcoin there is no expiration so policies like that seem really backward even though they make complete sense business-wise.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:57:00
Yes except when that happens, a lot of companies save face and that's how they survive. If btc is compromised, it's literally impossible to hide the fact that it's losing value.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:54:10
Any way to get something like this for binance? It'd be nice to know price notifications for manual stoploss when afk for too long.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:04:15
Bought at 12k to 15k. These are lessons learned so far. Still hodling cause I slept through the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:06:21
No no no. Go back to your bank and file for a 3rd mortgage. The market is down.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:13
Well... I mean... not to be blunt... but you conspire to do something before you do it...
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:39:22
So I'm signing in from rising posts. Anyone wanna explain what's going on right now?
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:07:54
So they are doing what they can to stuff it out before it goes widespread. I assume that won't really work well, considering there are probably many platforms bitcoiners (?) can talk, right? Or is this incorrect?
And no. I used to collect doge as a joke and stopped at like 30k. Lol.

It's not phishing to sell a used ledger with a written key under the official listing, considering it is sold used. Until the seed is recovered and the contents of the wallet stolen, there is no crime committed.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:02:50
I mean, Amazon yes but no crime was committed. You operate completely on faith that that person hadn't written the seed for themselves, but 1. you can reset the Ledger and 2. You can report someone for writing down words on a piece of paper, but that doesn't mean they did anything wrong. I'm not saying it's not obvious what is going on here, but I don't see how the law would get involved with this without OP being an actual victim.
