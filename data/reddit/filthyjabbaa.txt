I wonder if the Casinos will have games like [Primedice]( which have a really small house edge
@_date: 2015-03-29 09:56:39
[Primedice.com]( for sure, really low house edge

Is it possible to buy Bitcoin with PayPal? - Yes try [Virwox](
Bitcoin seems volatile. Is it safe to invest? - It's very volatile and not a wise investment(short term) long term I believe it is
Do believe Bitcoin has a long term future? - Absolutely

Not very clever considering BTC volatility. Personally I have 5% of my wealth in BTC, the rest is in Gold,Silver,Cash

doesn't work for my elecrum wallet. says "Hdseed is not of the correct electrum Master Public Key format" when it is....

On Blockchain.info It states that the balance is still in my desktop wallet and confirms that nothing was sent to the mobile wallet.
I really can't understand why my wallet is only showing 0.0029 but on blockchain.info it's 0.46

previous post -  
I had thought it would return to my wallet, but there's still nothing after waiting 24 hours
