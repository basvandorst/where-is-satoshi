I wouldn't store it on any other exchange but I have the majority of my bitcoin on a wallet at Coinbase. That seems like a  completely professional operation, it's probably safer there then on a wallet on my computer.

People, especially the big investors that are in bitcoin now,  could be getting some out to be in the stock market which has been doing great. When you get 10% in the market it's better than 10% in BTC because chances are that most of it's going to be there tomorrow.

The past few weeks I've done much better in the stock market than in crypto. Crypto has to produce or at least show that it can produce real value at some point (perhaps in the next two or so years) or it will fall like a house of cards.

It's an almost entirely speculative market that is open 24/7 with little to no real underpinning value at this point. There is your explanation.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:04:57
Convicted of what? What is the angle (based on facts not speculation)? There is a mess of speculation here and nothing else. You want it to be bad for crypto so you are putting the worst spin on it. Audits take too long and other firms are brought in all the time. But they are doing an audit. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:39:45
Because people like to exaggerate and I guess are emphasizing the point that you can lose money so nobody goes crazy. But if you are risking $20-100, which is the cost of a meal out, then you are not so "brave". I wish I had the time and technical wherewithal to try it myself. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:31:24
When there is an audit available (and I agree there should be an audit) and there is no crash I guarantee you that every single one of the people posting FUD here and elsewhere will be nowhere in sight.

Because they are trying to undercut Bitcoin and steal its name and reputation by calling it Bitcoin Cash (among many other things). That whole project is built on fraud and deception. Its no coincidence that their "chief scientist" is a fraud who perpetrated a hoax to pretend he is Satoshi. If that doesn't make it deserving to be called "BCash" then nothing does because that's what it is.

Er, wouldn't it be a problem if they only operated in such states and countries? Also, that list: Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, etc. is pretty limited, no?
I would like to see a full, independent accounting but I can't say I buy it. I don't see what Bitfinex, which is making an absolute mint anyway, gets out losing their business, being exposed to legal jeopardy and  potentially crashing the market. Also, if Tether is pushing the prices in this way (there are alot, there needs to be given demand and to keep it at a dollar) where is the discrepancy in prices with places that take fiat such as Coinbase? That would be one heck of an arbitrage, wouldn't it?

"Fuck you bye" to trolling retards like yourself who I am sure don't make up 90% of the user base. Go use BCash with stagnant technology and no development because BTC should be just like it was described in the white paper in 2009 forever (which BCash isn't anyway). 
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:28:37
They should have it beforehand but according to your theory they DO have the cash to back up Tether. Unless they are plowing it into a Swiss bank account or snorting a mountain of coke or something. But they are raking it in with the operation of the exchange so why do they need this? Anyway, there should be no room for speculation so there needs to be an absolute full, independent accounting and I hope there is enough pressure on them so that they will provide one. Here is something that seems underwhelming -   and it appears there is at least a claim that one is ongoing.

Barely anyone uses smart contracts or can figure out if they add value to anything yet. I own ETH and I hope they do but I wouldn't be surprised if in five years from now hardly a single real business or company (not an ICO) has used a "smart contract".  And you know ETH needs and is working on a second layer solution as well. And there are about twenty different technological developments coming to BTC in the near future (few that I understand but they are coming) and there is a huge development team working on BTC all of whom I am sure understand much, much more than the a reddit poster who has bought into the latest coin hype. And the LN is going to rock, you know it, I know it, don't be in denial.

I think it was BCash being added to Coinbase that led to the downturn. Another coin to take some of the dollars coming into CB.  It also emphasized a criticism of Bitcoin (whether valid or not) - that nearly anyone can create a copy of the coin and have another cryptocurrency all their own. If so, why does Bitcoin or any of these cryptocurrencies have value?

If its not used, it is for the same reason that most crypto isn't used for anything but speculation, namely volatility (along with tax implications). 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:50:43
This is true, but ultimately it is based on getting money to the right people to produce the best goods and services. It is terribly inefficient and the amount of skimming where "the illusion becomes real" that goes on is obscene. Perhaps therein lies the value of crypto as you say. We shall see, exciting times. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:31:15
All this talk of scaling solutions but volatility seems to me to be at least as a significant issue. It seems to preclude for now the use of crypto for anything but speculation . . .

BCash doesn't have Segwit which precludes it from efficiently getting a host of crucial improvements in the near future. It also has in effect two miners as it still permits the covert ASICBoost exploit. There is reason to believe that these miners blocked progress of Bitcoin so they could have just this kind of monopoly. BCash's "chief scientist", Craig Wright, is a man who perpetrated a bizarre and elaborate hoax to fool people into believing he was Satoshi Nakamoto and its main backer is the felon and unstable personality Roger Ver. There is lots more where that came from.

I only hold. The problem your are so worried about is being worked on in a reasonable (and ingenious) fashion. There are many good solutions being worked on by very smart people that are coming. Sorry, no one can snap their fingers and make an instant, decentralized, secure payment network despite what you think. We could make the blocksize 1GB or perhaps just put a SQL server in the basement of Bitmain and the problem as you see it would be solved. But that's not what I or most reasonable people want from Bitcoin.

The truth is that people are not buying cyptos so much because they believe in this or that technology, anyway. They are buying it because they think other people will buy it and this will drive the price up. It's almost all speculation at this point with a basis in hype and uncertainty.

Yes, but you can base you decision to buy on whether Lulemon is going to sell more tights and thus produce real value for the economy. And they pay a dividend based on their earnings to reflect this. No one can honestly say (even though they might believe it) whether crypto will start to produce real value for anyone but speculators in the future. In five years from now I doubt the price of Ether is going to go up because Vitalik wrote the latest type of smart contract (or whatever) if no one can use Ethereum (or Bitcoin or Bcash) for anything but speculation. In that case I hope I know the right time to jump ship.

Luke-jr, the problem is that so many just don't buy that. We have seen all sorts of iterations of blockchains with different parameters and schemes now that seem to be up and running and doing fine. Litecoin, for example, is not crippled (in fact, it is thriving) and it produces blocks at 4 times the rate of Bitcoin. You might be right but I suspect that you are using hyperbole to try to get your way. You are certainly arguing from authority but there are other knowledgeable people that disagree. I think the average user sees a fork and most importantly the loss of the contributions of Core to the chain with the greatest hash power as the biggest threat to Bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:55:10
That's why BitPay is doing this I assume. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:16:24
An overwhelming majority of the hash power is enough isn't it? That's what I suspect will happen with the upcoming fork. You got Segwit and I for one appreciate your effort, hard work and guts but it's hard to believe a change to 2 MB blocks would mean that much. Wouldn't it be ridiculous to have a Bitcoin with Segwit with 1MB blocks and another Bitcoin with Segwit with 2MB blocks? A skeptic of the value of Bitcoin might say that the coin can be replicated and copied ad infinitum and thus it has no real value at all. Another fork gives credence to that argument, no? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:13:11


Yes there is. 2x will have an overwhelming amount of hash power behind it.

Bitcoin being engaged in "survival of the fittest" completely ruins the idea of a blockchain as a safe store of value, doesn't it?

"Segwit itself increases the block size to 2-4 MB. You mean Segwit w/ 2-4 MB vs Segwit w/ 4-8 MB? I suppose that'd be ridiculous, but still less ridiculous than only the 4-8 MB variant."
Yes, that's what I mean but I disagree that having two such coins would be a better outcome than having just one. I am no expert, as you can guess, but from what I see it isn't that big of a technical difference but a matter of principle and might I say stubbornness. At some point political considerations need to be taken into account  even if the outcome isn't ideal from your point of view. Thanks again for your hard work. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:17:37
Don't get it twisted. I think Bcash and Ver suck immensely and I greatly appreciate the Core developers. But their obstinance and the overall pissing match is clearly a greater threat to BTC than an increase in the base block size from 1 to 2 MB.

So I removed some coins from Coinbase before the fork, split them after the fork according to this post  I had Electrum on my PC and "ElectronCash" on my laptop. After I split them and they were on two different wallets I figured the coins were separated so I sent the BTC back to Coinbase from my Electrum wallet. The BTC transaction cleared in Coinbase but I think the transaction showed up in my ElectronCash wallet and now my BCH is gone (although the time on the BCH transaction seems earlier than the Coinbase transaction). Was sending the BTC back to Coinbase a really bad move? Should this have happened? Is there anything I can do?

"LN is years away".  I don't buy that at all the way things are progressing. If there is not adoption it might just be because people don't see a use for the whole idea of crypto.

"In contrast, by design, Bitcoin Cash must notify tens of thousands of nodes (“databases”) around the world of the transaction, wait for them all to get in sync, and then ask all of these nodes to store the transaction record forever."

"The Bitcoin cash community would like to artificially suppress the price for processing a transaction (despite the fact that it has a real cost on everyone supporting the network).
My concern about this approach is that the cheap block space will be consumed as fast as it can be created so, in short order, we eventually end up with higher transaction costs anyways."

No one knows for sure what will happen with the USD and the trade issues, etc. But we know the capital gains tax will at least stay where it is with Trump in there.

@_date: 2018-07-19 20:15:07
I doubt either party will push through a ban but unreasonable regulation is a threat. The big issue is the capital gains tax which Democrats tend to favor increasing. Clinton's capital gains tax plan (no short term for six years and then still 20%!) would have been a wrecking ball for crypto. Crypto needs to get out from under the capital gains tax altogether if it is to truly be successful.

If there is a patent on ASICBoost than it's not profitable for anyone else to mine BTC so government is in effect granting such a privilege.

I don't see them pushing Segwit only. In fact, I've seen them open to subsequent block size increases. Not to mention that Segwit itself does in effect increase the block size. I'll hold if there is a reasonable compromise soon (Segwit activation of what's in place followed by a block size increase seems reasonable) but what came out of New York doesn't seem remotely feasible or reasonable. No one cares if I hold my BTC, of course, but if enough people get spooked the bubble can bust over night.

From what I understand there is no guarantee of such a thing with a hard fork and Rootstock is involved and they have an interest as well (as in a patent) in seeing that ASICBoost continues. Plus, the timetable offered (6 months) was totally unreasonable and dangerous. Just activiate Segwit in August and then a safe hard fork can happen 12 months after. Anyway, I won't care soon, I made a nice profit and I am ready to dump. BTC is a speculative balloon (see just today) and if the miners want a monopoly they will see it swiftly popped by those who don't want the uncertainty.

Well, I just diversified away from my big holdings in LTC and picked up more BTC (in case of this deal working out) and more ETH.

I think he will if he can get a face-saving subsequent HF (it probably doesn't matter what it is, as long as he gets his way on something). The alternative is that everything goes to shit and he has ASICBoost miners but no coins to mine them with. In LTC he got a nebulous agreement for a future HF and seeing as the alternative was a UASF he went for it. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:43:24
Let's see - 1) they manufactured their ASICs and included chips on them, at additional cost to them, specifically to use the exploit, 2) they admitted to using it on testnet (but they don't use the money making covert exploit on mainnet, suuure), 3) their unusual mining behavior is exactly what you would expect to see if they are indeed using it and 4) they filed a Chinese patent on the technology.

There is direct evidence, there is circumstantial evidence and there is speculation.

If he agrees to activate Segwit via softfork first and thus make ASICBoost a non-issue then we will know he is serious. Otherwise, it's time to blow up BTC in order to save it from monopolization. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:54:07
If a technology, particularly software, can't be upgraded and upgraded safely yet efficiently it won't be around too long. See below what doesn't work with ASICBoost: 
If ASICBoost isn't gone soon (and I mean very soon) then you can say sayonara to BTC. There are so many others to take its place and in fact ETH is more than half the way there. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:03:58
Sounds like the final agreement is obvious - Just activate this version of Segwit by August, then prepare a HF to 2MB in a year from now.

Well, presumably you aren't involved in doctoral level (or even graduate level) mathematics or statistics then. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:10:44
Go to any stats journal (or math or computer science) these days and look at the typesetting requirements or the articles themselves. Go to the PhD programs, they all have Latex templates and styles for doing dissertations which are requirements such as -  If you are a serious academician or even researcher in industry this isn't something that needs to be "proven"; it is an every day fact. EVERYONE uses Latex. By the way, given the atrocious grammar and typesetting in that Wright paper (I doubt he knows how to tex up anything) I wouldn't use it to line a bird cage.

dP indicates the "total derivative", I assume. In this case you would be correct. CSW's formula works trivially if V is strictly zero which is not what I assume he intended (you may as well try to discern what a monkey at a keyboard intended).

There's no way I would lock any of my money up on that shady exchange. Later on, if I am absolutely sure it is safe and provided it still exists and is worth anything, I will dump it and get more BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:05:22
No, Latex is becoming more and more pervasive in ALL scientific disciplines. In stats there were some old timers that stuck to Word or even typing but everything is done in Latex these days - presentations in Beamer, manuscripts, entire journals, dissertations, posters - you have to be nuts to do anything in something besides Latex. And collaboration is AWESOME with Latex, using git or something like overleaf. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:01:31
I have collaborators in different parts of the US and overseas. Git for tex and code is the only way anyone I know works together anymore (at least anyone under the age of 50). It is so good I wouldn't do it any other way.

Did you see his talk on YouTube the other day? He looks like a blathering, delusional idiot who doesn't know what he is talking about. I think him being so is the most logical explanation for all of this.

Someone that stupid and who would carry out such a ridiculous, elaborate hoax wasn't part of any such group. Also, he claims to have a PhD which he apparently doesn't have. What does that tell you? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:02:48
I think including the copyright and proper attribution is more a matter of fairness and personal integrity than a legal matter. That he apparently has little or no such integrity isn't surprising given for whom he is working.

I bought 5 of them when the price was about $200. I buy stuff every once in a while from Purse.io and then replenish my wallet so I get a little more (I bought a $27 calculator for example and bought $30 of bitcoin to buy it).  I have 25 Ethereum as well. You could do the same thing with 1 or 2 Bitcoin - I see the chance of the price bottoming out out any time in the near future as quite small so you don't have too much risk. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:25:59
Not I, I am dumping at least half my BCC as soon as I get a chance. I will hold some to see what happens, however. I think the idea of huge blocks to hold every transaction for the rest of time is a dumb idea. I also think the people involved with that project, such as Craig Wright and Roger Ver, are senseless and deeply unscrupulous.

"We" is commonly used in academic papers with single authors. It means "myself, the author and you, the reader".
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:13:05
I have been around long enough to know that Segwit makes increasing the blocksize easier and safer. Also, I read: "Bitmain's ASICBOOST is incompatible with most soft-fork upgrades, e.g. (U)TXO commitments". And if you believe that the miners care about anything except illicitly (not illegal, of course, but severely detrimental to the prospect of upgrading the network) monopolizing profits then I have a bridge to sell you. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:25:18
It's the threat that it is finally making things happen but I don't care to see it come to pass.

BTC is still significantly going up in value. The big issue driving the move to ETH is the uncertainty surrounding BTC and Segwit, a possible fork, etc. People look for something different to get into and there is Ethereum and its ICOs. It's why I have the majority of my money in ETH not because I am sure that it will amount to some sort of "world computer" or that even "smart contracts" will even be feasible. But who knows? In short BTC better get its act together and accept the compromise before August 1st or else you might see a big balloon pop and it will be in BTC not ETH like the writer states. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:36:16
It's hardly even cryptocurrency at that point but just a retarded, central data base. I can set up a SQL server in my garage that can process many more transactions than that and sell a coin that is a record of your holdings. What's the point? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:48:45
In the real world adults compromise. There is an offer to activate Segwit but with a increase of the block size to 2MB.  Even if you don't like this approach (I guess I don't) and think it's hasty with a bit of sense and maturity you should say, "ok, I don't agree but I am going to get in there and help out with the compromise". It's not a game, at this point there are people and businesses with lots of money and savings in BTC. My advise to Luke Jr. here is to grow-up and don't be a douche bag. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:06:01










It was opposed so Bitmain could keep using ASIC boost. There were no real objections with any merit. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:08:49
I was encouraged but now I'm not. J Garzik won't give a straight answer. Is SEGWIT IN THE AGREEMENT GOING TO BE ALTERED TO ALLOW COVERT ASICBOOST OR NOT? IF SO WHY, GIVEN THAT JIHAN WU SAID ASICBOOST (PRESUMABLY THE WHOLE THING) SHOULD BE DISABLED? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:25:55
Please read people: J. Garzik: 
"The WG agreed to 'segwit AND 2M', and that what we are focused on delivering.
To the extent that current segwit disables asicboost, or not, that remains unchanged and unmodified.
This issue asks the question, therefore, do additional changes need to be added, to further ban/disable/render inert asicboost."
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:07:11
So can we assume that Bitmain and other miners won't signal for it then based on their "contingency plan"? We were told segwit2x would have over 80% hash-rate support. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:23:11
Hot damn, he just a gave a straight answer. This is looking great. Thank you J. Garzik! If we can get rid of ASICBoost all together before or after the fork then even better. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:03:39
This means Segwit and no covert ASICBoost and no BU and has parts that both sides don't seem to like which means it is a compromise. Most importantly, some of us would like not to sell and if we don't we wouldn't like see the significant amount of money we have in BTC go down the crapper.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:17:42
I'm no expert for sure, but from what I understand as it activates the original version of Segwit it does to the same extent that Segwit does, i.e., the "covert" version of ASICBoost is disabled. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:29:22
Maybe someone can program a BTC AI master robot to make these decisions and compromises then. Until then we live in the real world with much money at stake.

If there is a chain split the price ain't going to half unless you mean half of almost nothing.

I just can't see a chain split going "well". If not a technical nightmare it will certainly be a complete PR disaster. Holding out hope that it gets resolved before August 1st. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:15:56
No offense, it's just an honest assessment of your "Segwit is patented" conspiracy theory. By the way, I thought the problem was that OTHERS had patents for technology used in Segwit not Blockstream. Also, patents take time, has anyone applied for such a patent? Complete nonsense.

There will be 42M if there is chain split (which is one among a number of reasons such an event would be a train wreck).

Seems like Segwit now + HF in 6 months is safer and less disruptive than UASF (even though the latter is bringing on the former). Where is Coinbase (and other exchanges)? They are raking in the dough. Why don't they spend some of it to safeguard their business, hire more developers and put more $$$ into expediting the process and making it safe? @_date: 2017-06-01 23:00:29

Last post says "Core just tagged 0.14.2 RC1". Sounds like they are on the way soon (I hope). Sorry, don't really want to dump nor do I care to lose my money and watch BTC and crypto in general blown to pieces. I'm sure others feel the same way.

Who knows, why don't they signal Segwit right now? Perhaps because in the real world human beings do funny things for not always rational (i.e. economic) reasons.

"SegWit is patented". Utter bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:14:34
The chain split from a UASF, which could come out of failing to   coerce a majority of the hash power to come along or else, sounds far more drastic then say a little chain that doesn't die forming say "Classic Bitcoin" (ala ETC) and some exchange picking it up. I really doubt that the highly speculative market for BTC would survive the possible chain split from a UASF but if a rump BTC survives despite nearly all the actors working together then who cares?
