Random variables have measurable frequency distributions, means, standard deviations, etc.  The fact that a time series is random does not imply that no profitable trading strategies are possible.

Sell liquidity.  I started trading at $25, now it's $11 and I'm still ahead of the game.  I've made more trading against the volatility than I've lost from the unfavorable trend.

A couple of points on the stability fund:
1. Genetic algorithms are the wrong approach.  The Bitcoin market is evolving too fast.  A GA will give you something that backtests OK, but has no predictive power.
2. The benefits to the Bitcoin economy (liquidity and stability) don't require a large pool of funds under one management.  They are served just as well by a multitude of amateur trading bots using different strategies.
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:14:04
Sorry, by "overkill" I meant grinding away at historical data without improving your return.  If you're right, and your genetic algorithm outperforms my simple-minded bot, of course I will turn it off immediately and sign up for your mutual fund.

It seems to me that the sellers would adjust their prices upwards by .54% to pass half the commission on to the buyers.   Otherwise, people would buy on one exchange, and sell on another.
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:59:18
If I'm right that AI is overkill, then I think we'll see lots of amateur bots with simple strategies.  It could be as easy as tweaking some open-source code.
When Bitcoin funds appear, I will of course monitor their performance to see if the GAs add value.
I suspect that better avenues for adding value might be: arbitrage among multiple exchanges, and negotiating directly with the exchanges to get sliding fees based on volume.

Instead of placing one order and wondering whether you priced it correctly, place multiple orders at different price points ($9, $9.50, $10, etc.).  Now you can be a bit wrong on your prediction, but still get some activity.  This will take away some of the temptation to change your orders.
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:17:17
Bravo!  Please put up a web page where we can monitor its progress every now and then.
And just out of curiosity, do you let your algorithm run wild, or do you review its orders before it places them?

$100 is a psychologically significant number, so there may be some more resistance as people cash out.  However, $100 bitcoin is also a news story, so once past $100, more publicity to bring more people in.

It doesn't have to be revolutionary.  It could be as simple as an expandable money supply pegged to the dollar.  That would be different from bitcoin, and it would be something that can't be backported into bitcoin without making bitcoin into something it isn't.
Would such a currency displace bitcoin?  That's for the market to decide.  The masses who are not already ideologically committed to bitcoin might prefer the stability.

There are indeed two different things going on here: a secular trend based on the fundamentals (the "rising floor" in OP's terminology), and the current price spike.
Now which of these two things is much bigger than the other?  Right.  The price spike is much bigger than the secular trend.  Calling a price spike a "mini-bubble" instead of a "bubble" doesn't make it any smaller.  It is what it is.
Because the price spikes dwarf the secular trend, there is money to be made "mitigating these cycles" regardless of whether the secular trend is gently up, or gently down, or even if one is agnostic as to the long-term fundamentals.

If you place limit orders, consider bitfloor.  They have a "maker/taker" fee structure, and if you're a maker, that is if you place a limit order that is not immediately executed, your commission when the order is filled is -.1%.  That's right, a negative commission.  bitfloor is paying you to provide liquidity.
If you buy and hold, or place market orders... not so much.

The whole argument depends on the bitcoin interest rate being zero, on there being no way to generate the extra bitcoins to pay the interest.
This is just wrong.  Even if the bitcoin supply is fixed (it isn't, due to mining), it is still possible for some people to earn bitcoins at the expense of others.  Bitcoin casinos are a great example.
Take a look at Coinlenders, Graet.loan or Ukyo.loan... adjust for risk, and you get some positive interest rate r for bitcoins.  Plug that into the interest rate parity equation, and there is no reason bitshares can't earn up to that rate of interest.

Not exactly.  Players with counter-trend strategies (arbs, market makers, etc.) provide negative feedback and increase stability.  Players with trend-following strategies (momentum investors, etc.) provide positive feedback and decrease stability.
Now one glance at the chart shows that the trend-following strategies are dominating lately.  So... the situation is very unstable.

Volatility is very low lately and there is not much to be made trading.  If you want to buy and hold, I suggest CampBX.

A few points... 
You can reduce fees by transferring $300 to an exchange at the beginning of the month and buying bitcoins at $10/day.
Dollar cost averaging reduces risk but doesn't increase return.
You CAN earn interest on bitcoins, Coinlenders for example.  Whether the interest is worth the counterparty risk is debatable.
You can also earn interest on your dollar balance awaiting conversion to bitcoins, for example by lending to margin traders at Bitfinex.  Again, there is the question of counterparty risk.

The market will fix this.  A rising price encourages hoarding, and a falling price encourages spending.

Right, and it's still a bubble because there's nothing limiting how low the price can go.  That doesn't mean the bubble has to pop this week or the next, but bitcoin crashed once before and it can crash again.
The interesting question is how to play bitcoin so that even if it crashes, you come out ahead.

Possible negative: **competition**
Bitcoin has a first-mover advantage, but it's possible that a new digital currency could disrupt.  Possible attributes might be: acceptability to regulators or stability (tied to gold or the dollar).  These attributes might not appeal to bitcoin community, but if they appeal to consumers in general, they could displace bitcoin.
Governments certainly have the resources to create a new digital currency; so do companies like Google and Amazon.
Note also that the VC-funded startups are not tying themselves to bitcoin in particular, they are building infrastructure for businesses based on virtual currencies in general.

Why not do both?  Convert fiat to bitcoin and invest in bitcoin-denominated businesses.

Suggestion: check out the various services that will print an uploaded color image to T shirts, aprons, etc.  I don't think you can get images printed to white duct tape, but there should be a way to get images printed to some kind of cloth that you can integrate with your duct tape wallets.
When I saw "customize however you want", I thought about having a wallet with a Bitcoin image on it... then I saw "please keep it simple".  Maybe there's a way to have it both ways.

I like the idea of modelling the system, but I think you've over-simplified things.  In addition to users, there are speculators (trend followers) who increase volatility, and market makers (counter-trend) who decrease volatility.
You might also model the news flow.  Right now, the rising price increases the positive news coverage, which increases the number of speculators, which raises the price.  We'll see a similar feedback effect with negative news on the downside.
@_date: 2013-09-09 01:21:06
OP is absolutely right.  Any bitcoin business that carries off-blockchain, bitcoin-denominated balances can engage in the equivalent of fractional reserve banking.  All it has to do is extend credit, in other words create more balances than there are bitcoins in reserve.
Given the ideological fixation on a fixed money supply in the bitcoin world, I don't know of any businesses that admit doing this, but I think some of it is inevitable:
- businesses that judiciously extend credit will be more profitable than those that do not
- because the balances are off the blockchain, there is nothing the bitcoin software can do to prevent the practice
- there is no central authority to forbid or regulate the practice

I'd like to run this in the background and be able to tell from the sound whether the market (BTC/USD) is trending upwards or downwards.  I don't know whether that means additional programming, or if you just need to explain what the sounds represent.

Bitcoin is **not** a technology.  Decentralized, cryptographically secured blockchains are a technology.  Bitcoin is a particular implementation of that technology.
It is entirely possible for the technology to succeed while the implementation fails.

The Buffett reference needs some elaboration.  The problem is not that everyone expects to get rich.  There's nothing wrong with selling picks and shovels during a gold rush.

I'd rather be honest with people.
"Yes, I'm excited about bitcoins.  I'm a crypto anarchist computer nerd and bitcoins are like catnip to me.  But you're more or less normal, so don't mess with it!"
