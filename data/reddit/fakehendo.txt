No. Let's ask them to validate my damn registration already. Almost going on two months with 4 support tickets now. :E
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:30:08
just as soon as Gemini wants to finish verifying me... looking about 1 month of waiting now -_-
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:01:58
I just did that last night actually lol I had forgotten about it and this thread reminded me haha
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:44:28
They finally just verified me today. Took 1 month, 18 days, and 4 support tickets where their responses were to "check the FAQ" lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:53:27
I always love this lol He can claim that he has to give them what they want all day long but if someone wanted to buy guaranteed lose money shares in a ponzi? Or ocean front property in Arizona are they going to sell it? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:52:22
you've solved it! I wonder why nobody else ever thought to check his forum profile
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:18:30
For a serious answer, they have said in the past that they're stored in multiple safe deposit boxes spread all around the country.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:04:20
lol yea someone from work telling me I should cash out because that's the only way he's going to believe that I made any money off of bitcoin lmao
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:10:59
omg lmfao
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:12:23
yea I remember an old(as in btc $200 old) interview with some early investors who were talking about their friends frying hard drives with 10,000 bitcoins stored on them. At the time it happened the wallets were only worth about $50 total. At the time of the interview...$2mill... and now............. makes me want to cry lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:03
of course he's going to say that. He has to lol because if he doesn't he admits that he's just trying to steal the name for self gain
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:11:54
Since I got voted down for making fun of Ver while everyone else got voted up, I'll take it the person doing the voting doesn't practice Jiu-Jitsu lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:02:10
not much of a dip seeing as it was this price barely a week ago lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:45:11
how can you take inactive coins lol that's like saying he wants to take them from anyone in this thread who has been holding long term
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:03:54
he doesn't start standing
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:53:30
this guy is such a douche bag lmao
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:04:04
Not sure why I'd be downvoted for giving the real answer lol Maybe if I said that every safety deposit box is on the top row so they need to be tall to get it? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:21:44
Good luck!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:45:11
lol don't worry, it will be back soon enough
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:41:09
Nice. I've actually been looking for something to use since I just put everything into cold storage. Any chance you'll be adding different skins or graphics to the portfolio page? Something similar to Exodus maybe. I like being able to see the graph depicting different percentages. Or possibly a way to denote when we bought in so we can see lifetime +/-
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:20:46
Nice try, Jihan.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:48:23
Unfortunately when one fails the people who spearheaded it will come back and try to "fix"(change) the victor
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:38:30
Because the people who forked off BCC don't control Litecoin. They're the only ones who "NEED" it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:53:52
so what are you getting at? almost this entire sub is essentially a twitter repost and new all time high meme feed lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:18:29
a twitter feed or a price ticker for every time we hit a new high. *new post* "OMG 5200!"   Then 30 seconds later... *new post of...* "OMG 5201!" by someone else
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:00:13
Given the nature of the show and the writers behind it, I don't think that it will portray it in a bad way.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:54:03
Unfortunately a large lump sum of money changes people. Note the ridiculously high divorce rate among lottery winners. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:29:22
Yes please. I say this all the time -_-
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:07:02
you think they accidentally typed the word core?
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:12:54
Yea fair point. I suppose you're right. They're the pretty face in front of the camera for the average person sitting at home 
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:45:11
Struggling... /eyeroll Still WAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY up over where it was in February of last year. But yea, struggling.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:15:06
I'm leaving for a vacation in Europe in October. I keep kicking myself saying, I'd have another coin or two by now if I wasn't going on this trip.  The struggle is real....
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:05:08
This is exactly what I was thinking. Ugh.
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:45:57
to the common person bits is better branding than satoshis. Go ask someone on the street which sounds better for a unit of money(especially when you tell them it's a piece ofa BITcoin. Rather than answer directly they're probably going to say, "wtf is a satoshi?" All respect to the creator but it sounds like something from an anime rather than a unit of money.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:27:06
You're right, you don't have to give a private road your money. Hence why a private road or bridge system is a pipe dream of libertarians who haven't read a history book. There would need to be so many tolls all over that people would avoid using said bridge or toll by any means possible, driving them into the red. Back when private roads were a thing, the large majority of them weren't profitable due to shunpiking. Then we'd be stuck with a completely fractured and localized road system. Around cities, yea, it might work in this day and age, but do you think roads that see little traffic are going to be privately funded? There are roads that see such little traffic that entire communities would be cut off. Transportation and infrastructure would crumble.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:22:06
he was quoting futurama
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:55:54
The new Tappan Z cost 4 billion. The Bay Bridge cost 6.4 billion and took 11 years to build. I don't think bcash is gonna cover that amount of speculation. Keep drinkin that kool-aid tho
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:35:49
Because people always want more. Not sure why this is even a question lol Humans are inherently greedy beings. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:35:41
he was making an example of someone creating an altcoin... pretty simple to understand. I guess he could have called it stellar, cardano, monero, or steem instead. /eyeroll
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:43:44
Damnit Jerry. You were supposed to ask them something simple. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:54:45
No. When someone comes to my door collecting money to build a new bridge I'll never use, I will 100% donate to help the project. I promise.  :x
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:38:39
Yes. It's annoying. We don't need 20 new threads every time there is a new high. "OMG BITCOIN 4500!!" 30 seconds later "OMFG BITCOIN 4550!" 30 seconds after that. "Bitcoin just hit 4552! Moon here we come!"  I realize that some may be easily excitable but people need to chill a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:34:17
As much as I like what they're doing with Gemini, I'll never understand why people care their opinion or think that they're somehow, in the know. They're not developers. They're basically just two rich kids who heard about bitcoin while at a bar and then went and bought $11million worth of it on a flyer. Asking them about bitcoin is kind of like asking Ronald McDonald where he sees the hamburger industry going by the end of the year. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:36:41
Step one. Don't talk about how much you have bought while at the same time asking about how to protect them. You're going to get yourself hacked, unfortunately. :/
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:42:11
yea it always cracks me up when people say, "I have X number of bitcoins."
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:33:56
It's closest without going over. So you're living up to your name it seems. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:27:55
And there is an estimated 4 million coins lost forever. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:59:13
Seriously guys? Are some of you really that slow? Substitute the words "golden pony dollars" for the word "litecoin" "steem" or "Kin" make sense now? It's not rocket science. He is talking about some artist creating his own altcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:18:58
Hi. We don't need a new thread updating the price every time it goes up.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:42:18
Yup. No corruption in the private sector. Instead of people trying to get every last dollar out of driving up the price, instead we'll get skimping on materials and cutting corners. That's the kind of bridge I want to drive across. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:41:25
Good for you man. Keep up the good work. While I never smoked, I somewhat know from watching others trying to quit just how hard it can be. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:33:01
Yea, you're right. Better just stick with printing them out on paper. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:39:25
