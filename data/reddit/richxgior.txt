bro they are mining bitcoin for themselves. mcaffee even said it only takes 2000 dollars roughly mine 1 bitcoin. They are doing it at the same time while charging customers premium rates where they can make scraps but still profit liek crazy. this is a billion dollar business. People have been doing this for a year now. check youtube, check everywhere its not a scam its real..
