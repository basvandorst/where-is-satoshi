Why does she get mad at you? Like you have control over it. 
Yeah that's scary man. She just sees you as a walking bitcoin symbol bail out for her.  Yeah. Watch it. Tell people you invested in another coin and lost it. Or something.

If the people are happy and don’t want a union. Then the union should stop trying to push their way in. 
The best way to stop unions is to treat the employees so good you don’t need one. Example: Costco.

Until they only care about their own interests. The best way to avoid unions , is treat the employees so well they don’t want a union. Unions have done a lot of good. But they can and do stifle companies.

Sorry. Not racist. Indians are Caucasian. It’s your culture. Of course not all Indians are this way. But even if it’s a small portion out of a billion people. Well that’s going to be a world problem. 
No means try harder and lies are ok as long as you get what’s needed for your family. Not a polite way to navigate through the world.

I wonder if he is in tech. Lots of resentment towards Indians with H1 visas.
