It's always worth remembering that market prices drive market prices, or atleast help toward. That premium may always be a little ahead of the current price, but when it comes to selling those BTC/LTC for cash/services, the fact that you paid a little more means you value them higher, thus asking a higher price, in turn, the person buying them goes through a similar mindset etc etc.

What I'm trying to get at, is that when you take USD out of the equation, which we hope will happen in 20+ years, if you own 10 Bitcoin NOW, you'll still own 10 Bitcoins in 20 years. 21 million total supply means you'll always own a percentage of the currency, more can't be printed in order to diminish that percentage.
By the way, you might want to keep that attitude in check if you want to be involved in sensible discussion.

That's a great analogy. They turned amazingly complex "behind the scenes" software into a colourful button on a screen that literally anyone can press and do stuff with. Nobody cares about the underlying tech, the complexities of the software, the millions of man-hours put into the refinement - the end product is chic and useable by anyone, and Bitcoin at the moment is a long, long way away from that.

I think FOMO (Fear of missing out) is rife across the spectrum, and not just Bitcoin. Don't worry, buy what you can afford. I mined 5BTC way back, hodling since. Do I wish I kept my rig running and mined more? You bet. But, I sold my equipment at almost no loss, and from time to time buy a little more here an there. As long as you keep track of how much you bought and and at what price, you can keep track of your investment :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:10:10
The FAQ is slightly misleading in as much as it's not necessarily about the number of miners, but the overall network hashrate (in this day of ASIC miners that is).
It is true however, that mining is what contributes toward that hashrate, and therefore makes the network less susceptible to attack the more independent nodes there are who have to "agree" on the state of the blockchain and transactions.
So it's not that mining is BAD, it's just that it's not worth it unless you have a lot of money to put into it.

Transactions are instant, its just 10 confirmations which 'concrete' them into the blockchain, in case of a fork or 51% attack, which has RARELY happened. Think of it like a company who accepts credit cards has to wait around 2 days for that transaction to hit their bank account, but they only don't give you what you purchased unless the monetary value is large.

Music's just fun man, it's about art and expression, which in a funny way is kinda the opposite separate from what Bitcoin IS. It'd be amazing to find a way to integrate the two in some way that genuinely benefits the community. Where the two cross-over and are similar is in the independence they inspire.
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:53:24
Whatever you say, pal.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:07:28
By all means be careful when looking into mining Bitcoin, the cost of the equipment is high and the chance of a return-on-investment is low.
Alt-coins however are something which newbies CAN get into, and Litecoin is a great place to start as it has the largest alt-coin market cap, equipment is cheaper and the community is always helpful.
The title of this post should have been "Dear Newbies, if you're thinking of mining, put the money into buying Bitcoins directly instead.
Or, if you want to learn about mining etc, the testnet is always there.

Is what I started my post with. I deal with the public day in day out at the PC repair workshop I run, and this is my observation of how Average Joe reacts/will react to these things. I'm not complaining that it's not going fast enough, I'm observing that for real mainstream adoption by the non-tech masses, it has to be dumbed down and made easy for them. You have to remember that some people don't even have a smartphone, you start talking computer, even in laymans terms, and they clam up. These are the majority of the general public, and they are the ultimate target audience.

I run a PC repair shop - the amount of times I've asked people who their email provider is and they "don't know" is mad, but understandable. I have to ask them what their email address is, and tell them that the bit after the " sign can tell me who their provider is. My point is that email has become so dumbed down to the end user, as well has standing a test of time - two things Bitcoin needs to work toward.
Like, Joe Bloggs doesn't care if his email is POP or IMAP, wether it uses SSL or TLS for authentication, they just email. Again I think that if you start using phrases like "multi-sig" or "offline wallet" it's going to freak people out and make them close up.

I understand what you're saying, from a technical point of view. If we want something adopted by the masses though, it has to be made dumb (to the end user).
You're quite right about banking and long numbers, but there's always someone you can phone to tell you what to do, what numbers to use and where to put them. There's nothing really like that yet for Bitcoin, and that in itself is a symptom of decentralisation which is possibly not favourable.
It's payment processors who will take the lead in dumbing down Bitcoin to the end user, providing such services as a layer on top of Bitcoin, but one that is transparent to the Average Joe.

This is bollocks to try and scare the average Joe away from Bitcoin. Decentralised banking = less money for the banks and less bonuses for the goons in charge, simple as that.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:47:33
Hence my point about the Average Joe already having a credit card, debit card etc. There's no inclination there to learn something new, why would they if what they already have works for their needs? I'm not trying to quash your point there as it's totally valid.
Another side of it could be, I've just been to the bank and there was a lady in there drawing cash out of her account.

This winds me up so much to see post like this. A large majority of people with Bitcoin hold them on their PC's with no issues.
Security is a 99% user-based thing. IF you're not a secure user, then your Bitcoins aren't secure.
If you're the kind of user with decent AV, different passwords for every website and wise against scam emails etc, then your Bitcoins ARE SECURE.
Paper wallets are great for long-term offline storage of huge amounts, but the work it takes to create load and unload paper wallets is way too much for the average Joe.

Are you spending ridiculously high amounts of USD in Doge? If I buy a house in BTC and the seller wants to wait 10 confirms, I'm happy with that. If I buy groceries at the store, there's literally no reason to wait for confirmations. The transaction IS instant.

At the moment I sell CD's for basically whatever people want to give me (even if it's nothing!). Little over 12 months ago Reddit kindly upvoted my SoundCloud album to the front page, I had my Bitcoin and Litecoin address on each song for donations, over 100k listens and... none ;) That was over a year ago though. The point is that I think it should be more than just a song about it and there we are. You ever get the feeling there's something *more* you can do, but not quite sure just *what*? Like, some kind of sponsorship, or a song FOR a Bitcoin campaign or something like that maybe.
Thanks for the suggestion though :)

What I like most about the Gox fiasco, is how ruthless and brutally honest we all are now when it comes to what we want out of an exchange.
It's good. It's phenomenally good, because when something is decentralised, it's faucets are only useful when used by the masses; and if the masses don't want to use it, it's no good.
Good on you so far, Reddit, for (in a good way) ripping a lot of this stuff to shreds, it'll make for a bigger, better, safer Bitcoin community in the future.

Totally agree. But the end user doesn't care what a protocol is, nor do they have any inclination to learn. To them, Email is just Email. I'm trying to look at this from the perspective of the target audience, which ultimately has to be the 99% of the world who aren't technically inclined.

I'd be willing to bet that a number of these people have fallen victim to a scam of some sort.
The amount of emails I get every week from "bIockchain.info" or similar mis-spellings, claiming to need my login details to process a deposit is massive, and only that I work in IT do I notice - a lot of people, tech savvy or not, click things in emails (especially where the promise of money is presented).
Also, people with malware on their PC's which change search settings etc can often hijack Google searches etc. Someone types "Blockchain" and they get re-directed to a scam site. In goes their login details and blam, funds stolen.
Nobody is "hacking" Block chain accounts. Nobody is specifically targeting users. I've fixed PC's for a living for nearly 10 years now, and 99.9% of the time when someone's account, on anything, is compromised, it's because they've (knowingly or not) given an attacker access.
This is why 2FA is vitally important in any situation, because even with a user name and password, nobody can access an account with 2FA (or it's certainly MUCH more difficult to do).
EDIT: It's also worth pointing out that in my experience, even if you can actively show someone that they've enabled a scam to take place, they will deny responsibility and blame it on hackers. It's human nature to not want to admit we fucked up.

I got in to LTC originally, when diff was around 600. Had the option of spending £2000 on mining equipment, or £2000 on LTC. Went with the former. Mined about 500, gambled a load away, ended up with 167LTC which I sold for 4BTC.
No regrets, I learnt so much and had a blast. Had I have just bought and held then sold off at (more or less) the peak, I'd probably have long forgotten about cryptocurrencies and the world of decentralisation.

@_date: 2015-01-03 17:05:54
No. The price is a reflection of the exchange rate, the ON-market supply and demand.
MS accepting Bitcoin is a reflection of how "good" it's doing. Growing consumer and merchant adoption. A growing number of transactions is a better reflection. Hashrate etc etc.
So many things are a much more concrete reflection on how "good" Bitcoin is doing than the price, which, let's be honest, 90% of these people are hanging onto like 0.1BTC and are complaining because it's not at $1000000000000 yet so they can get rich super quick.
I've been a part of Bitcoin for 3 years, I didn't sell when the price soared, I have continued to buy some, use some, spend some and donate some.

It's not a fallacy, it's a fact. If I have 100 apples and 200 people want to buy more than one, then the price goes up because those apples have become more sought-after. If I'm receiving 10 new apples a day, but the same amount of people want to buy, then the price is going to slowly drop. It's how markets work.

You're fucking everywhere on this sub whinging about people trading bitcoin?
Judging from your posting history you're a "get-rich-quick"er who's butthurt that his 0.5BTC isn't worth $1mil yet. Good luck with that. You're clearly an "expert", why not pop over to and have a pop at them over there?

TeamViewer is password protected, but it appears to have been my password which was compromised, and therefore how the attacker got in.
Again I don't necessarily think the issue is having the two on the same machine, it certainly would have been had I not had the seed offline and no password on the wallet.
The other issue with Virtual machines is that using this method, the attacker would've had access to those too.

TeamViewer is remote access software. You create an account, install it on all your PC's and you can then access any from any other.
@_date: 2015-04-19 22:46:41
Food for thought.
TeamViewer has always been out of convenience, it's now been totally uninstalled.
For now, I have a Hamachi VPN running and UVNC on my machines with a separate password for each, until I can figure out how to set up a proper VPN; I've always had bad experiences with OpenVPN, time to try again I guess!

I used to be a mod on WeMineLTC (missed the BTC train slightly!) in Early to Mid 2013, not long before the big bubble. The Cryptospace was... different back then. Not so many trolls, just a load of cool people involved with this thing. The price rose and normal average Joe's who were just into geeky stuff could suddenly afford to buy houses. After $1100, and the influx of new people, that "golden era" ended somehow... Fond memories. Not that I'm complaining, because the infrastructure we have now is beyond any of our crazy dreams even 2 or 3 years ago. I wonder if one day we'll look back on today as a golden era.

So it looks like these guys are going to take ASIC mining to the consumer market, and VC's seem to think they'll succeed... very interesting. Subsidised heating maybe? What kind of incentive does this provide for the consumer I wonder? Exciting times we live in.

I do this. I have my BTC in a Password-protected Electrum wallet, then my 12 word seed is stored in a hidden Truecrypt volume on 3 separate nano USB sticks in places only I know and then on two separate cloud-based storage facilities. Every 12 months I replace the USB sticks &amp; rotate all my passwords.

I'm an LTC adopter here, please please don't downvote.
I hate Bitcoin "versus" Litecoin. I really do. It's not what it's about. We're not the "silver" to the "gold", we're an alternate cryptocurrency with a large and growing userbase, a lot of whom have moved GPU rigs over to mining Litecoin.
There's tens of new alts per day, which are fads, pump and dumpts etc, but I think the relationship between Bitcoin and Litecoin is only going to get healthier, we support each other in the grand scheme of things.

Hm - surely looking at the sheer increase in Bitcoin price over the last 12 months is a clear indicator that they'll be worth more in another 12 months?
Or would it be better to invest that money in buying 4 or 5 bitcoins today and hoping the value increases as it has already?

I have £1500 money saved, I've not touched it in a while, it's not generating much interest. Looking at the price of BitCoins compared to how much they were worth 12 months ago, I could stand to atleast double that, and, in all honesty, I wouldn't be TOO bothered about losing £1500 if it all crashed.
Where would I buy bitcoins from in the UK, and how does one go about cashing them in?
