Absolutely no scam at all.  I work very hard to provide this service.
May I ask what lead you to think this was some sort of scam?
And the starter account will always be free and it provides unlimited email and SMS alerts so no scam in that.
Regarding the premium accounts, I use Stripe as my payment processor and you can also choose to use Paypal, or Payza so I'm confused on why you could say it is a scam?

**BTC-Monitor Update!**
BTC-Monitor has been updated and our Multiplex Alert has even more alert configuration options!
With a Multiplex Alert you could create an alert to monitor the markets and notify you when market "A" goes above a certain price while at the same time market "B" is below a certain price. 
**But this is a just scratching the surface of the power in a Multiplex alert.** A more detailed example would be an alert to notify you when market "A" reaches a certain price and the trading volume of market "B" has decreased by 10% over the past hour and market "C" has seen a price drop by 5% in the same hour!
**With Multiplex alerts you have the power to create and fine tune alerts for practically any set of market conditions for any combination of the major markets you can imagine.**
