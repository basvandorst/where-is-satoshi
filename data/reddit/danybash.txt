eh.. bought from them a few times.. in the past, terrible customer service.. at least they used to have terrible service a few years ago. 
Also they seem to pad the shipping costs a lot.. there used to always be someone complaining about them on overclock.net don't know if still bad though.. my exp. is from a few years ago

being new to BTC, can someone explain to me why someone would join such a large pool? from what I understand the larger the pool the smaller your share unless you have a really large hash rate.
so wouldn't make more sense even for people with large hash rates to join smaller pools like slush's?
