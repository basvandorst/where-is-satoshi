Private Forkchains are the future

Expect volumes in India to surge more. They just fired their central bank head who was against drastically lowering interest rates. Almost all big Indian companies are heavily leveraged and along with the government and government run companies, would love the money printing machine to accelerate. 
tl;dr: if you are in India, get out of the rupee.

Well looks like it wasn't all that bad a strategy ;) 
I usually try to buy on dips. I want to diversify a little to some Alts, but that market seems to be super hot now. Would you recommend anything in particular?

I have been buying a small percent of my salary every month. I have not been investing since it hit $1200 before the BU/Segwit crash. 
I want to buy more, but now seems like not the right time. I am thinking of buying again if it dips below 1600. Would you reckon that's a fair call?

Bitcoin has long been dead.
It's all about that private blockchain tech these days. All of us here are just trolling.

No. Private blockchain. Like "Secure Blockchain" built on CitiQL®.

making it illegal to buy new bitcoin will only help make hodlers millionaires.

Regulate it the way the government regulates gold - for the sake of equivalence. They are not the same things, but almost are. 
Banning it is pointless - can't really be done.

Where did you find that chart btw? I am new to this, and want to track.
