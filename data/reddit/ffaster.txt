One of the easiest ways is to go to bitminter.com and register with them and download their client.  It runs using Java, so if you don't have Java installed you may also have to do that.  You CAN mine with your cpu and/or graphics card if your pc or mac has one.  If you use those, it will probably take a long time to mine even 0.01 Bitcoins.  Most people now are using ASIC chips, and you can buy some USB Block Erupters on amazon or ebay.  Those can be had now for around $10-$15 each.

The code is set to generate 25 bitcoins approximately every 10 minutes.  When bitcoin first started, it was 50 bitcoins.  As more and more people start mining with faster and more powerful equipment, the difficulty increases so that the number of bitcoins awarded for solving a block will stay the same.  Eventually the number awarded will halve itself again to 12.5 btc and keep halving on a set schedule - not sure but I think every 2 years?  This model was created so that an even number of bitcoins in currency will continue to be created no matter how many miners or what the difficulty is until the number reaches 21 million bitcoins.  If suddenly a bunch if people stopped mining or lost electricity, the difficulty would adjust itself and go down.

It's free to set up an account, I believe they take 2.5 percent of sales.

Aha thanks, just learned something new.  I have noticed that a new block is usually generated in less than 10 minutes, so that makes sense.
