The best you can say is that you have no idea why that call was made, saying it's either a bunch of tiny traders or 1 person is creating a false dichotomy (it could have been a group, an institution or any number of other scenarios that none of us can think of) and saying it was 1 person who did it to drive down the price is naively speculative.
But yeah, keep chasing that white whale to try and make a rational narrative from an irrational system. No one knows why that 30,000 Bitcoin sell was made, then retracted, except those responsible for it. If you know exactly what's going on behind the scenes, why don't you explain it to us so we can all make money?

It's the manifestation of a community that has confused gambling with investing. Whale's are gamblers with huge amounts of money to throw around. Bears are investors who believe a stock is priced too high and intend to make money when it falls. Bearwhale is the combination of the fears of gamblers who fancy themselves investors when they suddenly start losing a significant amount of money.
It's pretty transparent, they're trying to inject a rational conspiracy into a fundamentally irrational system so that at least they have a chance to outsmart it and come out rich. It's grasping for control where there is none.

I love blaming this crash on some boogeywhale as if $1000 bitcoins weren't hysterically overpriced to begin with. No, this isn't a correction after widespread media coverage overhyped some new currency/commodity, it's some evil rich guy driving down the price of his investment! Why? So he can buy it cheaper! It's sooooo diabolical!

It's absolutely a sock puppet. I'm willing to bet the picture of the 'son' was a picture of OP's 10 year old little brother, because there's no way OP is older than 15.

This is hilarious.

$o R where's the spork?
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:44:23
Wow you are really invested in OPs story... definitely not an alt, though, definitely not.

Number 8 is truly well rounded.

The whole thing is a sales pitch by an investor in Chipotle, from a company with investments in Chipotle. This is embedded advertising. 
Aside from that, you got to love an article that closes with a snake oil sales pitch:


The link then leads to a form where apparently you only need to enter your email address (not a credit card! how nice of them) to get this secret 100% surefire stock that will make you rich.
At least they know their target audience.
edit: for the record, I'm a total bitcoin outsider. I have no money invested in bitcoins, never purchased anything with bitcoins and don't plan on it anytime in the near future. This article just lacks any credibility whatsoever. It's blatant embedded advertising.
edit: i found the company Motley Fool is shilling. SWIR

Or it's like you've lost 4 games straight, but if you zoom out and combine all the scores, you end up with more points than your opponents. Which is absolutely meaningless because you still lost those 4 games- and it has nothing to do with whether or not you'll win the next one.

They weren't using a truly random number generator? How stupid can they be? Next you're going to tell me they weren't powering their servers with free energy machines.

This is what continues to confuse me. I thought bitcoin was a new currency not a new addition to your investment portfolio.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:57:47
Not even close. He's saying bitcoin enthusiasts act like assholes when the price is up, so they can't complain to assholes who show up when the price is down without being hypocrites. That has nothing to do with the just-world fallacy- you're just trying to sound smart.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:51:51
My point is telling people to GTFO because you disagree with them is idiotic.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:43:25
You're using your brain mostly to argue with people who are trying to explain why this would never work, even if you could magically convince every person in this sub to buy $5 worth of bitcoin.

Holy crap you're a hipster economist.
"The *real* definition of 'inflation' is too mainstream..."
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:35:02


Yeah, only positive echos allowed in this chamber. This isn't place to discuss bitcoin- it's a place to praise it unconditionally. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:29:23
For what it's worth, that conversation was hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:18:29


Sounds more like a direct appeal for information.

See, I'm aware that investing in currency is possible and many people do so successfully, but those are typically professionals in finance, whether they be professional investors or large institutions. With Bitcoin, it seems as almost every enthusiast talks about its incredible mechanisms as an alternative currency while treating it like an investment. 
90% of the content of this sub is focused on the price as it relates to USD and the implications of that price on peoples' portfolios. However, 90% of the posts that attempt to define bitcoin describe its utility as a currency. 
It's possible that I'm having trouble really getting a grasp on Bitcoin because I'm trying to define it in traditional terms when it's really something entirely new.
