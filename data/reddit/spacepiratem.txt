Oh my god.  300MB.  Do you even realise that at 6 blocks an hour, thats 1.8GB blocksize growth per hour?
Firstly you have issues with block promulgation, and chain splits would be occurring every hour.  Secondly, this rate of blocksize growth is absolutely unsustainable, gonna be centralized server farms.  Easy Banker takeover.

We need to reduce the blocksize!! 300kB should be fine for decentralization and that will kill off the miners scam Btrash coin!!

True.  There is no "backlog".  Just FUDDING by BCASH shills.  Go back to the other sub.

C'mon, Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell has recently celebrated the high fee events by uncorking champagne.  Bitcoin Core developers are celebrating this occasion!  High fees clearly represent a good store of value!!

I agree.  Everyone should withdraw ALL BTC held on Coinbase immediately.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:03:57
Absolutely correct.  THis guy is a well known scammer.  
We need to shore up our defences and reduce blocksize to 300kB to prevent these scammers and VER from spamming our mempool.  Then we will hit 100k by 2018

Go and fork off then.  Call your altcoin fork BTC 2X ver2.0
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:16:35
Everyone beware, VER paid shills and scammers are infiltrating r/bitcoin to restart the 2X attack!
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:58:01
True.  Everyone needs to chill.  BTFD

Coinbase is in league with Ver and Jihan to dump BTC  
This is an unacceptable position for a large public company to adopt.  We should withdraw all our BTC immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:48:55
Don't be daft.  Use LTC for transactions, BTC is a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:51:00
BTC is not handicapped.  This is functional design.  Let the altcoins have fast transactions, we need to focus on decentralization, which is the true goal of BTC.
Those alts will be bought out by Banksters soon, mark my words.

Luke was right.  We need to focus our efforts on 300kB blocks to prevent spam attacks.
If we lower the block size, scammer Roger Ver and Btrash can't attack us any more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:19:28
Incorrect.  Larger blocks increase the attack vectors for spam attacks, which is what is happening now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:01:14
As soon as coinbase opens, dump all scamcoins/alts, buy BTC, transfer off exchange and close coinbase account.

Luke was right.  We need to focus our efforts on 300kB blocks to prevent spam attacks.
Lowering the blocksize will stop coinbase and ver from attacking us

Luke was right.  We need to focus our efforts on 300kB blocks to prevent spam attacks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:39:12
Finally an astute observation!  Luke-jr was right, 300kB sizes to weed out spam is the way to go.  LN will resolve off-chain txns
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:54:51
Don't be ridiculous.  A healthy fee market is a good sign of high demand.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:33:11
Stop being sarcastic.  High fees indicate a good store of value.  Give LN the time it needs to get it right.  Security and decentralization are key to BTC.
