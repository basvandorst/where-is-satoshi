Segwit is a pre-req for LN, so yes. That is a true statement.

OP, correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like all of the comments are missing your point. They're talking about getting your piece of paper with the seed written down, while you more meant you'd be 'fishing for recovery seed sentences' through word bank manipulations through software?

I'm a large advocate for mid volume acorns trading (just round-ups won't see gains above the fees) and crypto. You're properly diversifying!
I personally am following a similar approach, but putting only what I could stand to lose into crypto as there are many uncertainties. It's a higher volume spec stock if I had to rank it as something in my portfolio. Acorns on the other hand is something with less volatility so it's obviously a much safer investment and I don't see it as a place I only put what I could stand to lose. 
Do your due diligence and understand risks associated with all investing, but also make sure your money works for you instead of sitting in a checking account or a bogus basis point savings account.

I have to respectfully disagree. I'm slightly older than OP but in a very similar financial situation. 
There's absolutely no telling what could intervene on Bitcoin **tomorrow** that could drive the value significantly down, even to parity with the dollar, never to rise again. While blockchain will most certainly be utilized in many forms in the near future and likely be a major technology in most industries, Bitcoin itself could be obsolete. I'm a risk seeker. My portfolio is extremely aggressive to the point I'm often times scared of elections/politics impacting markets, or whenever Jannet Yellen opens her mouth into a microphone. Liquidating an IRA to put entirely into Bitcoin is absolutely not the correct thing to do. Not hedging your investments properly could cause you a world of hurt in a moment's notice. An IRA will provide a **stable** income post-retirement, especially if OP is compounding starting in his early 20's. If Bitcoin goes to 100k/BTC next year and OP didn't liquidate, the regret will be substantially less than if OP liquidates all assets into BTC and BTC fails.

I posted on Twitter a couple of days ago that I’d send any of my friends interested, 10USD of bitcoin. Each time I sent on super economy out of copay I had a 15% fee. With popularity of bitcoin increasing, how is this sustainable? Many mobile wallets you can’t reasonably justify sending BTC to a merchant for say a slice and a beer. The fee will deter any of this type of commerce. What could help this sort of issue/can we do to improve the situation. As a public perception this is terrible.

Will your balance fluctuate with the price of bitcoin or do you send BTC for a static amount? That'd be neat if while you didn't 'spend' the BTC it held like a wallet because you haven't spent it yet.

It's not about a judge being an idiot. It's more about this likely not being in court enough to where a precedent wasn't set. The law *is* precedent.

Yeah, I stopped.
I don't disagree with him either, just man... dislike toxicity in this sub. It's getting more and more prevalent imo.

*kith* I reacted poorly. I do appreciate the info. I went and looked up a lot about Lightning Labs!

Excellent, thank you!
You'll notice in this thread not everyone was as helpful as you lol. That really does help me though. Thanks for the followups.

So, did he get some BTC? I'd vote yes.

Didn't the devs openly say for the community to not use mainnet?

As I said in a further reply, I haven't been keeping up lately. I work 60 hours a week and travel most of the time for my job. I asked a question. I was grateful for another community member who replied to me and informed me otherwise. I'm clearly not a technology guru nor am I claiming to be. 
We could all do without your toxicity.

You sound like Roger Ver making statements like this.
