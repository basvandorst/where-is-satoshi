You will see people will rather believe recent bullshit stories about scifi book author Neal Stephenson being Satoshi....
And you know what is more important .  SN didn't only write a white paper, which is where 99.99% of people will stop their research... He wrote a shitload of code,  no one is looking at it....  It was rewritten and cleaned, but the dirty original code still exists, and I wonder why it's never a topic of discussion... I mean it's the real code written by the real Satoshi.... It's where the rabbit hole starts and gets interesting and pretty obvious when we look at le roux's works.. When you look at the code and the decisions made by 'both' authors, good and bad coding practices... 'they' both used only what 'they' knew.

My friend you can visit the old source forge repos and see for yourself... The question is what are you going to do with your findings?

The frightening part is the similarities between truecrypt and core's code, also look at comments and references. And so we all know who made true crypt, where the author is now.  Luckily I don't see this news coming out soon, it will just be rediculed as some conspiracy theory... Maybe it's better that way with our investments made into this currency.

If you have time read some of the code of Truecrypt on SourceForge and then also abit of the v0.1 code of bitcoin core...  What you will find is frightening. Luckily none of these 'crypto' people can understand it or draw the conclusions and the bitcoin price will not crash on this news.
