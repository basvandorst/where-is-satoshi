I can't use Robinhood from where I am, so I don't know much about it...but from my understanding the trades they do for stocks are free as well.  So how are they making profits off of stock trading?  I always thought their business was just run at a loss and then to sell it once it reached critical mass type thing.

Thank you, I've been in contact with them and they have assured me they will list it with me shortly.

I think your confusion comes from the terminology ATM, all Bitcoin ATM's are currently cash based.
No Bitcoin ATM currently in the wild has the ability to use a debit card as payment.  All of them are essentially cash in and bitcoin (in the case of one directional ATM's like the Lamassu) or bitcoin in cash out (this is an additional feature that larger ATM's like the Robocoin Kiosk or BitAccess have and makes it bi-directional).
The reason there is a need for Bitcoin ATM's is that it offers a simple and comfortable way for people to purchase Bitcoin.  As regulations tighten though more and more KYC/AML features are having to be utilized on these ATM's which makes it a bit more difficult.
The ATM's allow for easy setup of permanent locations to purchase Bitcoin, and many people would rather buy from a fixed machine then off the internet or somebody they met on an on-line forum.

Not I.  Are there quite a few Robocoins heading to Toronto?  I heard there were about 30 already slated to ship to Canada end of April.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:54:12
I spoke with Lamassu and those are the shipping locations where Lamassu has sent the ATM's.  They are by no means permanent locations (especially as Lamassu's are fairly portable).

I love this.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:39:57
When these guys open up they'll be added to the [ATM map](  Along with the functionality of being able to search by coin type.  I'm surprised that none of the big players (Lamassu, Robocoin, and BitAccess) have made a move to accept any alt-coins yet.  Although I am kind of happy as I see alt-coins being the biggest threat to bitcoin in the long term.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:28:37
You are correct.  I've updated it to reflect that.
Thank you.

As far as I know there isn't a permanent ATM setup in New York right now, although at least one resident has a Lamassu sitting around.  He just can't use it due to regulations right now.
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:59:46
I try to keep up to date with that, but I need the communities help.  But just to give you a quick rundown.
[BitAccess]( ID scanner with webcam for facial match for transactions over $3000.  SMS verification.
[Lamassu]( No form of ID whatsoever, although there are currently some plans from third party developers for SMS verification.
[Genesis1](  Has an optional fingerprint scanner so it comes down to if whether the operator wants to pay the extra $500 or not.  
[Robocoin](  All of these are optional and it comes down to whether the operator lives in an area or demands it.  The Robocoin kiosk comes with a palm vein scanner (used because it is a useless metric unlike a fingerprint), webcam, ID scanner, and SMS verification.  Each of these can be turned on or off individually.
These are the machines you'll be most likely to run into in North America, if you'd like to know about some of the other ones coming out of Asia (Numoni) I'm not as well versed in those.  Haven't had a chance to get to Asia recently.

I don't see how showing the manufacturer is really detrimental to providing the nearest location of the ATM.  We are just trying to build the community in general and also provide information for people looking to purchase ATM's.  
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:35:40

I created this to help show the growth of the bitcoin community throughout the world.  As I'm constantly contacting owners of new ATM's to get them to add their ATM's to the map I've been able to see all sorts of neat ideas/community initiatives built around them. 
I just received 2 e-mails from redditors about the Winnipeg and Montreal ATM's and they will be added to the map!
@_date: 2014-06-26 21:06:03
Hey man!
Haven't seen you at BEMU in awhile, hope to catch up soon.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:29:30
I believe that's one of the reasons that Robocoin went with a palm vein scanner.  As far as identification goes it's a pretty useless metric, you never put your palm veins on anything and noone else uses it.  A fingerprint scanner would freak me out a bit though as it's fairly ubiquitous.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:45:05
Thanks for posting my site, there are a huge number of ATM's that are prepped and ready for launch right now.  Just today there was news and I have been talking to the people ready to launch a few hundred in Dubai.  Yesterday there was the news of the first ATM to be able to accept multiple forms of cryptocurrency.
In the next couple of months I expect this number to grow exponentially, and if you guys can throw any information my way (fee % especially).  I'd be greatly appreciative! 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:02:37
It's kind of interesting right now to see how regions are affecting the spread of the machines with BitAccess dominating eastern Canada...and Lamassu taking over the European market.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:31:18

Bitcoin Puts Hit on Dogecoin
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:45:29
No problem!
I'm starting to get new additions from the client side and am working hard to track down news stories of ATM's opening up worldwide.  This month should be huge for ATM deliveries so keep checking back as more Lamassu's go on-line and that Robocoin shipment goes out at the end of the month.
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:25:46
The Genesis1 has yet to launch an ATM, but I believe when they launch they will be very competitive.  Currently in my opinion the Robocoin kiosk has the best KYC/AML(Know your customer/Anti-money laundering) procedures in place if you live in a country where that is important.  BitAccess has the best track record of meeting shipment deadlines (for a full featured ATM where you can both buy and sell bitcoin) and looks very competitive.  
If you are looking for something that just allows a customer to buy bitcoin and aren't worried about AML/KYC then Lamassu is your best bet, they are shipping quickly and cheaply.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:55:08
The ATM operator chooses the fee, currently these fees are anywhere from 3-12% around the world with the majority falling between 3 and 6.  I have heard no reports of any cards being skimmed, although currently most ATMs only do cash to bitcoin (or the reverse).
I think that as the market settles you will see these fees drop to between 1 and 3% at ATMs.

Any wallet will work, most of them work by scanning the QR code that your wallet provides and then depositing directly to that.

That's awesome, are you releasing your own machine or purchasing a ready made one?  You can add it yourself so you have control over the listing. 
Or if you are releasing your own machine I will add it to the directory.

I just went to open a business account at BMO yesterday.  Had to fill in a ton of paperwork, it's interesting that they kept calling it 'Digital Gold'.
Anyways, I'm really hoping that them making me jump through these hoops is a sign that they want my business.  I want to be legitimate but FINTRAC won't recognize me, and other banks keep shutting me down.
I'll keep you guys posted on what happens.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:35:42
You guys should send me an e-mail when you open a new ATM so I can easily add it to the [map](
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:28:01
It varies between 3-12% with the majority of them being between 3-6%.  This has been falling as more ATM's come online and I expect within a few months the industry standard will be 3%.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:04:52
A lot of times it doesn't have to do with a specific law or regulation that is in place but the expectation of that regulation to happen.  
For example in Canada there is no current regulation on Bitcoin and the majority of Bitcoin companies (with the exception of Vault of Satoshi) can't even get an MSB licence because the government doesn't regulate it as it's something entirely new.
The people who DO regulate it are the banks, and no bank will come near you if there is the hint of money laundering.  A lot of people say that banks won't work with bitcoin due to the fact that they are afraid of it taking away from their bottom line...this could have some truth to it, but in reality the biggest risk to banks is the AML side of things.
Now why does a Bitcoin company need a bank you ask?  
It's the only legit way to transfer fiat money to your exchange account that needs to be constantly refilled as people use your ATM to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:42:01

I'm always interested in getting more information on any of the ATM locations.  Currently most of my posting information has been directly from users, operators, or the manufacturers.  I'm still lacking a lot of the ATM fee% information so when these ATM's become more widespread consumers can make educated decisions.

@_date: 2014-03-03 18:25:30
There are a few people working on that right now actually.  Trying to get all of the ATM operators on board with something that follows KYC (Know your customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering Legislation).  It's a neat idea, but from what I hear from the main ATM players currently (Robocoin, BitAccess, and Lamassu) that Robocoin is the only one who doesn't want to contribute/play nice with that idea.
This idea wouldn't be stuck with a card but would most likely be attached to an SMS number, so you can probably expect that in the near future (Possibly with everyone but Robocoin).
One thing that people need to realize is that you aren't going to get far in a brick and mortar operation (like a permanent ATM spot) without complying with regulations.  In Canada a lot [ALL] of the banks won't even allow you to open up an account if it has anything to do with Bitcoin even with all of the anti-money laundering tech that a Robocoin has.  Basically if you try to take the easy money and not have the scanner set up then you are more than likely going to be taking in some dirty money.  This dirty money is why places get shut down.
But yeah...it sucks, rules suck.  Let my bitcoins be free.

I created a shortlist of banks/credit unions who haven't expressly come out against Bitcoin that I'm working my way through.  
I also set up a meeting with the CAMLO of a major bank, but I'm not expecting too much from that.  I think my partner has already been e-mailing back and forth with you, but I'll let you know if we are able to affect any change. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:19:56
That ATM was a temporary one.  I emailed the people at Safello to see if they were putting it in a permanent location and hadn't heard back from them.   It's hard to keep track of all the Lamassu's as they are so easily moved about, on BitcoinATMmap I try to ensure that all listings are permanent/verified locations.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:56:27

ATM fees worldwide currently vary from between 3% to (reportedly) 12%.  I know where I'm from there was a guy charging 12-15% and doing 40K a week.  He runs one of those WE BUY GOLD businesses though so I expect he really isn't into it for the community building aspect.

Quote from Wikipedia
Liberty Reserve was a Costa Rica-based centralized digital currency service that billed itself as the "oldest, safest and most popular payment processor... serving millions all around a world"
Liberty reserve billed itself as something that it was not.  They marketed it to people who didn't understand how the transfers worked...they just made it happen.  Bitcoin doesn't advertise or market, but it's a complex system.  Even though there are similar ways to use BTC people still need to be taught about it in a way...there is no marketing team, just a belief.  If someone I'm acquainted with asks me about bitcoin I ask if they are willing to sit down for 10 minutes, because that's how long it takes to understand just the basics.
