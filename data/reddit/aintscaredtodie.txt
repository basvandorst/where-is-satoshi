Intellectual acceptance is a synonym for logic?

Rest assure they're wrong, I made a post about it right here and maybe 1 out of 20 were able to come up with roi range, was talking about 100K, the others had no idea whatsoever (sorry for the terrible generalization, it's my figure of speech) - gamblers, calling on blind, addicted to their own hand, and casino-high.

True but at some point the value of converting our BTC to the local currencies would be vulnarbale to inflation due to the fact it's not just us that thought about converting at the 11.5 last week but 20% of the coin holders.

Actually XRP broke correlation, only cryx up since yesterday, see the charts,(IMO) BTC will stand on 14Kish on Monday and then 8K till next week. (HnS formation)

Every investment is made based upon the realisation of profit prior to the change in the value of the asset.. keep holding the BTC is not a wise investment if you did not understand that at some point you'll want to use it.. so you need to determine what should be the rate that you would consider that a proper investment otherwise you are just getting addicted to your own hand.

So you are not going to cash out your BTC but simply wait for the majority of the western world to ditch their own money for a lower amount of money.. then what?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:41:23
It is the old shift between commodities such as Gold, Sugar, Oil vs. A digital coin..which is undoubtedly would at some point replace governmental currencies but isn't that would require world peace or at the very least - global financial laws first?

Tell that to the 'experts' - the dump is way closer than they think since there's already 2,000 cryptocurrencies atm, ETC already broke the BTC correlation and it's main advantage is simply a slightly newer technology, while Litecoin/LTC was sold by its own founder upon reaching the 32x ceiling but fuck do I know, just another broker.

Wait for the taxes..

Yes, Charts/Trends for correlation theory, also sentiment does play a major role since the majority of BTCH out there doesn't really have a clue about anything other than terminology, while the others with a minor experience with cryptocurrencies have any actual experience with forex.
Have you ever heard any average BTCH thinking to buy at $17K+? Nope, that train left the station.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:12:18
That's exactly my point, at some point the value of your BTC will get lower hopefully not lower than the amount you've already purchased your BTC with.

Bitcoin is less tied to domestic economy that's true but it is still very vulnerable to inflation, I'm not going to accept BTC payments since that would mean I'm not able to use it domestically, meaning I will have to x my BTC to the local currency in order to do that and since the only ones to be able to do that are other investors that would cause a serious inflation since the BTC would forever remain tied to the local currencies and here we are, trying to compete with our banks.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:54:10
When are you planning to cash out?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:10:43
Who would you sell that to? Jamie Dimon?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:11:09
BTC is already dying imo.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:06:04
Investing in the idea of bitcoin because..?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:16:18
I'm saying expect a BTC dump soon.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:12:54
Spend it where.. govs going to tax it.. (finally a realistic investor!)
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:10:13
Only gamblers put their money on a blind outcome .. so you just going to hold BTC regardless of anything and not knowing when you'll be able to use it? (If)
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:41:45
Actually no, Bitcoin is dropping because it reached a ceiling and the majority of bitcoin holders are amateurs that heard about it cause it went viral so they bought it just because it was the first of its kind.
Now popularity drops when better alternatives in terms of tech and security are present (XRP is the new shit now, broke market correlations) - if you did buy bitcoin and you didn't know when to sell it.. I suggest you to sell.
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:40:21
Very cool, now would you spend your Bitcoins for a noodle? 
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:39:14
So all the suckers stuck with their BTC will claim your downvote is a FUD and you can get banned.. pff.

I'm fking dying xD
