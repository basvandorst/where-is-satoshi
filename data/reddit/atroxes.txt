By "the same", I mean it'll budge only  a few percent to either side in the next few years, *if* the BTC valuation stay at or around $400. It's highly unlikely this will happen though.
You can't think of value as being something that you hold up against USD. You have to think differently and think about "What can I buy with X amount of Y currency?". My personal bet is that X amount of USD, as time has shown, will be able to buy less and less due to inflation and the fact that more and more USD are produced every day.
Bitcoin also inflates, but will do that even less so in the future after the next halving. This means that the amount of "stuff" 1 BTC can buy in 2018, will only slightly diminish over time compared to USD or most other currencies. This, coupled with the inflation of popular fiat currencies such as the Dollar, means that the number of Dollars 1 BTC will be able to purchase, will naturally slightly rise over time. Even if no more "outside money" is put into Bitcoin, the USD value og 1 BTC will still rise slowly, because BTC in the future will inflate significantly slower than USD does.
Currently BTC inflates at about 9-10~% per year (assuming again no added outside value coming in) due to the amount of generated coins. In 3-4 years, USD inflation will surpass BTC inflation and the inflation gap between the two will continue to widen as time goes on.
An extremely bullish outlook, assuming Bitcoin doesn't fail horribly, is that if we can maintain the current market cap, USD/BTC value will rise slowly on its own, simply because of the inflation of fiat.
It's only numbers though. The actual *stuff* that BTC can purchase will stay exactly the same. Outside value has to be put into Bitcoin for stuff/BTC to rise and that's really what hodlers want.
The USD cost for an item isn't particularly interesting to people holding large sums of BTC since stuff/BTC will naturally stay the same as the market adjusts.
I can only suggest that people who hold BTC stop worrying about month-to-month fluctuation and spend more time looking at the long term and how the protocol develops and matures.
Forget months or weeks and start counting in years. This will take a long time.

I've found Kraken to be extremely professional though. SEPA transfers take about 6 hours and BTC transfer is instant.

The price follows user adoption and user adoption is tightly bound to ease of use. Ease of use is improving rapidly with services like Trezor and Circle to name a few.

Thing is... thousands of people have probably been trying to get their Bitcoin out for months and months, but have been stuck in verification queue.
Mt. Gox has been able to completely control how much funds were leaving their site at any given time. They can just stop verifying accounts and say that there's a delay, due to too many people having to be verified.
Even though you've been responsible and only had a few Bitcoin at the site and decided to pull out maybe 6-8 months ago (like me), you could have been stuck on verification for months or as long at Mt. Gox felt like having you stuck.

Given that many value BTC in USD, if BTC stays at $400 the Bitcoin market cap will stay at the same number but you'll be able to buy less and less with your BTC if you keep converting to USD when buying.
With the inflation of USD, BTC value in USD should slowly but surely rise naturally unless something awful happens.

They won't.  They'll end up using a centralized service where bitcoin moves freely around that system for free, like Coinbase. Then at the backend you still have the blockchain. It's not ideal but that's how poor countries will get to use bitcoin.

Nothing from that thread is telling me Kraken is scamming anyone. It's just a bunch of users complaining about slow customer support during early december 2013 rush and people bitching about going over the withdrawal limit their verification tier allows them.

**Edit:** Just now, for kicks, I checked my verification level (tier). Yesterday around 11am I uploaded passport and utility bill images for verification purposes. Sometime between then and just now, I got tier 3 verified.

Not this again...
Come on. You can't expect any company to make a multi million dollar bet that bitcoin will succeed.
Services like Coinbase were created exactly for this purpose. They're a gateway into accepting bitcoin that's risk free for the companies choosing to use it. This results in a lot of companies going "Why the heck not?" which is precisely what we need considering bitcoin is barely 6 years old. Bitcoin is immature and has a long way to go. Easing into it is the correct move for these types of companies and eventually, they too will see the light and start investing into the ecosystem.

Try thinking ahead instead of insisting on staying in the present. Bitcoin is amazingly bad at handling small transactions and incredible at handling larger transactions, exactly because confirmation times are quite long. Getting 6 confirmations for a $5 transaction  is a pain but for a $100.000 transaction it's a non - issue and you'll happily wait an hour to transfer that amount securely.
Smaller transactions should be handled by centralized handlers like Coinbase or BitPay. When those companies say a bill has been paid you can rely on it as a merchant and don't have to wait for even 1 confirmation. Yes, in a perfect world you would be able to use bitcoin for all types of transactions but bitcoin isn't perfect. In the future a developer might solve the issue with smaller transactions but in the meantime just accept the fact that smaller transactions can be cumbersome.
Use centralisation  where necessary and use decentralization anywhere else.

People turn their computers on and off every day, usually they're turned off at night to conserve electricity, mine are at least.
Wouldn't this sometimes result in the 3x redundancy being not enough? In my mind, it won't be that rare for the 3 nodes where your own important data is located to be turned off at the same time, at that exact critical moment where you need your data back from the Storj network.
To combat this, do you plan on implementing some sort of stability rating system for nodes? Or do you have other plans? Or will you simply not accept users to run nodes that aren't online 24/7?

I think the big increase in merchant adoption lately is really beginning to show, since the vast majority of companies who accept Bitcoin, exchange for fiat instantly upon customer purchase.
I know this has been mentioned hundreds of times on here already, but I really do think this is the main "culprit" with regards to the crashing price as of late.
Imagine you yourself being a person who holds thousands of BTC and then suddenly you start seeing reputable companies with products that you actually want, start accepting BTC as payment. You have thousands of BTC and you can 2-3 of those and get a sweet new gaming rig or a new smartphone. I think that's simply too tempting for many of the early-early adopters.
Other than that, I have no idea. The price has been going down for weeks now and for any "bad news" to stay hidden that long seems improbable.

ALWAYS hold your coins yourself. If you don't hold them yourself and if you aren't the only one with the private keys, they're not your coins.

As a side note, be careful if you wish to laminate a folded paper wallet. Many paper wallet generators require you to fold the paper wallet to of course hide the private key.
However when using a laminator, the heat it generates can make the printed private key transfer to the paper it is folded up against and can make the private key unreadable. The problem is, you might first notice this 5 years later when you eagerly want to get that 1 BTC from your paper wallet, only to see that it's unreadable :(

Currently the BTCGuild pool is hovering around 3.150 TH/s and it's rising steadily.
Assuming every single miner connected to the pool uses PPLNS at a 3% fee, BTCGuild is making per day an average of 32~BTC or roughly $28.700. This income is steady and is predictable. The best kind of profit.
BTCGuild, due to the fact that they've long ago chosen to only use the Stratum protocol, are not spending $28.700 a day to maintain their servers. I do not know how much they spend on user support, but I'll bet my left testicle (the large one) that at least 80% of their earnings are going directly into their pockets, which is fine by me, it's a great and stable pool.
So, could they scam every miner and make a larger short term profit? Certainly. Would it be the best way to make money in the long term? Hell no.
It would be insanely, indescribably stupid of them to stray from what they are currently doing. They're earning more than $850.000 a MONTH from mining fees. That's $10.000.000 a year. TEN million. Assuming that their hashrate follows along with the difficulty, this number is steady, but will increase as the BTC/USD increases.
They have an insanely profitable business model right now. They'd have to insane to change anything about it.

Let me try and put things into a bit of perspective for you:
*The printing press* disrupted how books were copied (books were copied by hand before it) and gave a much wider audience access to more books at less cost.
*The typewriter* enabled any person to quickly and efficiently type up very long pieces of text and disrupted the current established system of hiring professional writers to handle long texts that you wanted to write down. Before the typewriter, you need professional help to publish large quantities of texts if you didn't want to do it all by hand yourself.
*The car* changed how far, fast and easily people could move within a certain time frame. It disrupted the industry of "moving people" and moved people away from using trains, boats or horses, into using cars.
*The MPEG-3 file format* disrupted the music industry by enabling everyone with a computer to store compressed audio on their home computers while still retaining a good enough audio quality for listening. Before MP3, you used a psychical medium such as a CD, a cassette or a vinyl record. Before MP3 other digital formats did exist, but they weren't very effective at compressing the audio and therefore didn't reach wide adoption.
*Bitcoin* disrupts not only the current banking system, but our entire way of transferring value from place to place. A few hundred years ago, if you yourself wanted to move a large amount of money, you could use for instance paper money, gold or silver. Regardless of your choice, the medium was psychical. Bitcoin enables you to digitally move value, effectively rendering the psychical movement of value obsolete. As an example, who would move 50 lbs of value 3,500 miles when you have the ability to move the same value the same distance, digitally? It costs money/energy/effort to move weight, be it paper, gold or silver, so why not remove that cost? This is what really makes Bitcoin disruptive to our current financial systems.
Yes, money can be moved digitally today already by banks. You can choose to let a bank handle your transfer of value to another place. If you want to take care of doing the transfer yourself though, you have to deal with a psychical medium, there's is simply no way around it. This also quite severely limits the options you have for moving your value far distances. You end up having to deal with regulations regarding moving psychical value from country to country. It really isn't possibly for a normal person to move their savings to the other side of the globe without the help of a bank.
Bitcoin enables anyone, anywhere to do that. Bitcoin takes that power and puts it into the hands of every single person on this planet with an internet connection. If a person has $500,000 (800~ BTC) saved up after having worked hard for decades, they'd have to pay huge fees to move that money to the other side of the globe, since you simply can't move that much value psychically through several airports.
With Bitcoin, you don't even have to "move" your 800 BTC. You simple travel to wherever you wish to live happily ever after and you spend your BTC at that place.
That's extremely disruptive, and that's only ONE of the things Bitcoin enables you to do.

Please calm down and take a look back through history. Again we can make the simple comparison to the early days of the internet.
Only for specialists and hobbyist nerds. Very few actual uses. Extremely hard to get into and required extensive knowledge to use.
Look at the internet today. My 5 year old nephew is installing apps on his Android tablet by himself.
Saying that our generation has somehow agreed on something is simply wrong. That's like saying the internet was at some point "agreed upon" which doesn't fit at all. It's gradual and it'll happen over time. That doesn't detract from how wonderful Bitcoin is though, regardless of current market price. The technology is a revolution in and of itself.

For every Xcoin, any psychical store merchant wants to accept, they have to to be able to present a QR-code to the customer.
This means that it's very unlikely that any psychical store merchant will have more than 2-3 QR-codes plastered around his cash register. That alone is enough for that merchant to choose the most widely spread Xcoin and stick to that. Currently, Bitcoin is thousands of miles ahead of any other type of distributed currency, so merchants are much more likely to simply default to Bitcoin. Of course the merchant could invest in a tablet and payment processors like BitPay might in the future accept a plethora of other currencies, but then it suddenly becomes a hassle to accept them. The merchant has to spend hours educating themselves on the topic of distributed currencies and why there are more than one, has to invest in hardware and has to educated themselves and employees on how to use the tablet/system.
This is the main reason why I think we won't see a world where there are 5-10 really big distributed currencies that are competing around the same market cap. One big currency and then a bunch of other ones, some with more use than others, will exist but they will mainly be used for online trading, money laundering, gambling and the likes.

You are under the false assumption that Bitcoin is currently peaking. It isn't.
Services, utilities and methods will continue to be developed and layered on top of Bitcoin. We simply don't know what tomorrow will bring in terms of new use cases for Bitcoin. When the internet was born, it was horrible and useless place to find anything and was mostly used as a gimmick. You could say Bitcoin is at the same stage today, although Bitcoin is far beyond only being a gimmick already.
Give a few years. You'll start seeing companies build easy-to-use systems that will start empowering users with way of sending and receiving value that you can't even begin to think of right now.

$7.000 at before 25 years of age, is good number and the right time to do it. If in 5 years Bitcoin is no more and your money is lost some how in the progress (bug happens, value reaches 0 in an hour) you simply lost $7.000. A large amount of money, sure, but far from impossible to recover from.
If Bitcoin stays at $500 forever, great, perfect thing to do, moving your money into Bitcoin, you simply saved yourself a ton of fees.
Remember though, Bitcoin doesn't accumulate interest. Its value only fluctuates. I wouldn't treat that $7.000 as life savings, but more as a rainy day fund now.

Bitplastic.com is probably one of the shadiest looking websites I've ever seen.
To his statement regarding "the hacker injected his own withdrawal address to your withdrawal request." that would require either your network to have been compromised or their network.
Either way, Bitplaces.com doesn't even have the option for enabling HTTPS. Going to  results in a timeout. ANY business that doesn't do any and all transactions over HTTPS should be considered scams or at least be considered extremely unprofessional and very insecure.
Claiming that "some hacker" took your funds, is a classic Bitcoin scam method.

Regardless of what timezones you place the data duplicates in, situations will eventually arise where that data becomes unavailable, even with 3 or 4 duplicates of that data. It is unlikely, but possible.
I'm wondering what's being done for this to become near *impossible*.
One could imagine the "system" always trying to make sure that 3-4 copies exist and are *online* at all times, meaning if a copy goes offline, the data will spread to a new node and over time the data will try to make sure it only exists on the most stable nodes.
@_date: 2014-05-31 11:31:56
So basically, if I'm seeing what I'd call a relative low number of incoming connection to my full node, it simply means the Bitcoin network is healthy and little can be done to make even healthier.
If suddenly a ton of other reachable nodes got disconnected, my incoming connections would spike and I'd then be receiving the connections instead of them.
Gotcha :)

25 years ago you couldn't expect anyone to take e-mail seriously either. A cumbersome project to handle a terminal, knowing the right commands, typing in long addresses that were hard to remember, simply a pain to use and even though it was smart, free and fast, it made little sense at the time to use it for anything serious.
Boy did things change huh?
Why am I making this parallel? Because you cannot look at how a technology is currently used and by that judge its usefulness or its right to exist.
Bitcoin doesn't need to be "trusted". Time will handle that all by itself. As with all new technology, in the beginning it can be quite expensive (read: time = money) to use and Bitcoin takes TIME to use right now for your average holiday shopper, compared to a credit card.
If you do not believe Bitcoin has a "case" you can choose to sit back, wait and then see what'll happen. E-mail didn't have a "case" in 1990 either. MP3 files were once primarily used for illegal copying of copyrighted works. Touch-devices were once just a nifty gimmick and what would ANYONE ever need 1TB of storage for?
What would anyone ever really need Bitcoin for? Wait and see.

If they own Bitcoin, they know the price fluctuates on a day-to-day basis. Noone who pays you in Bitcoin will expect you to act like an exchange and they are fully aware of the fact that when they choose to buy something with Bitcoin with a store that primarily uses USD when pricing their products, the customer in fact converts their Bitcoin into USD, and then make the purchase. The USD amount is printed onto the receipt, as with any other purchase, and you should then simply tell the customer upfront that in the case of return of the merchandise, he or she will be reimbursed as per the USD amount on the receipt, in USD.
Then they themselves can turn that into Bitcoin again if they so wish.
just be upfront and let the customer know how you deal with these things, that's the most important part.

So in 10 years, every single person who uses BTC will still have to share the available amount of coins. If we're in a situation  where BTC is so succesful that fiat crumbles, you don't really think BTC will have the same purchasing power as it has now right?
It's basic math and logic. For BTC to conquer fiat, we'd have to have adoption on an extreme scale in he order of at least half the entire world population using it. Lets say 18 mill. coins for 4 bill. people...
I don't know how many people are using BTC actively today, but you can easily divide that 4 bill. by a 1000, at least.
Purchasing power of a currency is proportionate to the amount of trust people put in that currency. For BTC to gain more trust than fiat and thereby killing fiat... that's a lot of trust/purchasing power.

An understandable concern. I think however that we'll see mining staying quite decentralized between a number of mining operations, hundreds or even thousands of them.

The ENTIRE REASON Netflix has become so popular, is because it's cheap, easy to use and because it isn't PPV.
When you buy a Netflix subscription, you buy freedom. Freedom to watch 150 movies a month or to watch 2. You buy unrestricted access to the content.
This is a business model that has made Netflix extremely successful. Why on earth would they be interested in going PPV, when they already have a model that WORKS?!
Now, for Bitcoin and Netflix to make sense together, the only sensible thing they could do, would be to offer 1,2 or 3 year memberships at discounted prices if you pay with Bitcoin. Netflix saves transaction fees and the customer gets a cheaper product.

Let me tell you why:
Want to hide some money from *someone*?. Buy bitcoin with cash through localbitcoins or other ways from private sellers. Do it over a longer period of time. That money can later be spent as you wish, in any country in the world, at any time. All governmental control of where and how you spend your paycheck is obliterated.
That money can still work for you if you're wise about investing it. Cash can't work for you while it's under your madras, bitcoins can, if you know how.
Drugs and illegal services is what always keeps getting highlighted on here, but the fact that any and all governmental control with the finances of its people is completely gone is a much larger issue in my mind.

This will in turn make sure the general public becomes aware of mobile device security.
Here in Denmark, it was extremely rare to get pick pocketed in the streets of any larger city here. Now it's an every day occurrence. As such, people have become aware of the problem and have started taking precautions such as never carrying too much cash, putting their wallet in a secret pocket or simply only bringing a credit card. People have evolved with the times.
The same thing will happen with Bitcoin. Noone will (and hopefully aren't right now) store more in their mobile phone than they are currently storing in their cash wallet. People will start actually thinking about what they put onto their phones and won't just mindlessly install every single free game and expect them to be safe.

Even though the FED has a lot of capital to run an alternative to Bitcoin, securing it is a whole other matter.
It would require huge amounts of hashing power for them to keep their "FEDcoin" network safe from potential enemies who would want to take over the network. Running their own alternative to Bitcoin would be VERY costly, if they want it to be secure.
Simply using Bitcoin would be a much cheaper and a much safer approach for them.
Nothing prevents them from buying Bitcoin through multiple inlets, pooling them together and transfer those funds around the globe, without anyone being able to attach specific transactions to the FED. Over time, someone, somewhere, might be able to find out what addresses the FED uses, but if they go about this correctly, they can stay virtually hidden.

There are a myriad of things you cannot do with 1.5Mbps upstream bandwidth, simply because **it's not enough bandwidth to do anything in 2016!**
To name a few, without crippling your latency, you cannot:
* Upload just about any size file to a hosting service
* Host *any* type of server
* Video chat

The primary fear when it comes to a hard fork, is that we might end up with a minority  and a majority chain, which would "split" Bitcoin in two. With the way Bitcoin PoW and difficulty adjustment work today, this is unlikely, but, a possibility.

You casually omit the part where I write: "To name a few, without crippling your latency, you cannot:"
I assume when Chakra_Scientist states "noone else in my house can do anything on the internet" he's refering to web browsing, gaming, watching Netflix and generally consuming multimedia content from the web.
In 1984 there were litterally no services that required low latency to function properly. You expected to wait a few seconds for data to come your way when you requested it. Web pages, which were primarily text-based back then, were a few thousand bytes in size. Today, almost every type of service requires millisecond latencies to function adequately.
This link shows a list of 110 countries that have at least 20.000 speed tests made, and on 23rd place you find the United States with an average upload speed of 5.4Mbps. 
1.5MBps is on par with Malaysia, Albania, Honduras and Brazil. 1.5Mbps is simply not enough upstream bandwidth to run a full node without affecting the latency of that connection, even with 1/4 of todays block size.
Do you think we should reduce the block size by 1/4 to 0.25 MB to accomodate Internet users with upstream bandwidth that are *way* below par for the times?
Or do you think we should cater to the hundreds of millions of users who have a completely average Internet connections that are already more than capable of handling blocks 4-8x times the current size?
Using the lowest common denominator as a measuring stick for how we should scale Bitcoin is nonsense. We have to be reasonable, but *reasonable* is a two-way street.

0-confirmation payments are made significantly less reliable when blocks are constantly full and a high fee paid one moment, suddenly isn't high enough the next.
A few years back, 0-confirmation payments were great for smaller payments, coffee, groceries, dinner. When we're constantly at the 1MB limit, not so much.

Miners who consistently control &gt;51% of the hash power can enforce any rule they see fit. However, they are incentivized to act in the interest of the community since they rely on profits from mined coins to keep their operation profitable.

Before blocks were constantly full, 0-confirmation payments were somewhat reliable and secure *enough* for smaller amounts, because there was a very high probability that the payment would be included in the very next block.
Today, even with an appropriate fee chosen, it's a gamble whether your transaction gets pushed to the back of the queue by an influx of transactions with a slightly higher fee.

It's a complicated topic and *really* hard to put into few words or even few sentences, but I'll try and share my view.
Section 6 of the white paper talks about incentives for miners:


It all comes down to "What will make me, as a miner, the most profits?".
This is what creates this illusive *Community Consensus* they we see mentioned everywhere these days. There's no place to find a formally written statement of what the current *Community Consensus* is, it's no declared anywhere, at least not directly.
Community Consensus is shown through the valuation of Bitcoin. The price (or value) you get in EUR, USD, XMR, ETH etc., when you trade in your BTC for another currency or property, or when you trade it back into BTC.
So, in short:
1. A consistent majority of miners make a choice.
2. Community Consensus is shown through an increase or a decrease in valuation.
3. The miners were either *right* or *wrong* in their choice.
It's very hard to know beforehand what the community actually wants. If exchanges are against a rule change and miners push it through anyway, the users might then change the mind of exchanges by only using exchanges who *did* support the rule change, and vice versa.
It's such an interesting topic, but not a very simple one, at all.

I really appreciate the work you guys have put into making using Bitcoin easier and more convenient to use while keeping security a high priority. I love Coinbase and have used your services many times in the past.
When storing bitcoin long term, it just doesn't make sense to me, personally, to involve a 3rd party in any way shape or form.
Even though keys are generated locally in the browser, you're still *online* while doing so. Inexperienced users, who you guys are trying to help, are very likely to have no idea if the system they're using is secure or not, putting them at risk. That is not in any way Coinbase's fault, that's just the harsh reality of the world we live in.
I'd suggest any of the following:
* A Raspberry (without bluetooth and WiFi) with Electrum, that doesn't touch the Internet after wallet generation
* Paper wallet from bitaddress.org, generated offline
* Hardware wallet from a reputable vendor
If I'm wrong, please lecture me! I might be severely misinformed.

What you fail to understand is that with no block size limit, demand directly dictates the size of the blockchain. Putting an artificial limit (as is in place right now) constrains the growth of Bitcoin and keeps the blockchain size artificially low.
Right now blocks aren't full, on average. Imagine if they were. Yeah, the blockchain size will grow very predictably with 1MB blocks every 10 minutes, but who in their right mind would use Bitcoin in the long run? If blocks are full an queues are piling up with transactions, your average Bitcoin user will never be able to participate on the blockchain due to ever-increasing fees. At some point the system simply breaks because what happened to digital money free for everyone to use? Only those willing to pay dollars, maybe even tens of dollars, will be able to transfer ownership on the blockchain. Sure, that's a really great system for those with amazing amounts of wealth, but are those the people we are building this ecosystem for? I'm not.

The users can definitely change the rules of Bitcoin, and are already enforcing them indirectly. Users can't change the rules by putting up a few non-mining nodes though.
For users to change the consensus rules, it's a long an arduous process of placing their business and resources according to their beliefs, thus slowly altering the economic incentives of the miners.

You are judging the merit of a new technology based upon who is currently using that technology and the current state of that technology.
I will try and go over your points as briefly as possible:
- Why is centralization bad? Because money/value is power and centralized power corrupts. A system where a central authority ultimately has control over your personal ability to spend your own money, is fundamentally a flawed system that's just begging to be exploited.
- Security, or lack thereof. At the most basic level, to use a credit card online, you have to hand over your credit card information to a 3rd party. You mention "so long as someone doesn't obtain your card or card info". That's what you do, every single time you shop online. You hand over your information to someone. Multiple corporations around the world have shown they cannot handle this responsibility, including a company you specifically mention in your reply, Target.
- International transfers. Maybe most people would actually use international transfers if they weren't costly, slow and only available to 1/7th of the worlds population. Bitcoin enables anyone, anywhere, to do international transfers for a few cents, securely and instantly.
- Charge backs. You do not have "options" if you're selling a product to someone with a stolen credit card and VISA, MasterCard or PayPal initiates a charge back. You cannot possibly know in advance, if your customer is using a stolen credit card. The fact that you do not "work with scum" is possibly true, until it suddenly isn't and you're left with the bill as a merchant.
- Comparison to Morse code. You have strong opinions regarding Bitcoin and you're of course entitled to those. That doesn't make them either true or false though, they're just opinions. Bitcoin is no more a pyramid scheme than investing in stocks or precious metals are pyramid schemes.

You sound like someone who've known about bitcoin for less than a year. Some of us have been here since bitcoin went above $10 a piece.
Of course we hope bitcoin will become valuable. That doesn't mean I would suddenly cash out though. I've bought at $10, $30, $200, $800 and recent at $220. I have sold a tiny bit and later rebought that again.

Bitcoin is extremely similar to gold without any of the disadvantages. Gold has a 7 trillion dollar market cap. If Bitcoin succeeds, I see younger generations using bitcoin as a safe store of value instead of gold. With higher market cap comes less volatility.

If a majority of miners agree on raising the 21M coin limit, nothing would stand in their way.
Other than, you know, economic incentive not to do that, since all faith in Bitcoin would vanish overnight, thus imploding the price and turning miner hardware into expensive space heaters.

@_date: 2017-07-21 14:58:22
SegWit2x (the agreement includes a 2MB block size increase) is backed by nearly 100% of miners and a large majority of economic actors.
Personally, I would like 8MB, or even 20MB, blocks within the next few years, however, the agreement stands: 2MB blocksize is coming.
Unless of course multiple actors back out of the agreement, which would be a monumentally dickish move on their part, having already agreed to the entirety of the SegWit2x agreement.

The headline "Bitcoin CEO" has been missused time and time again and anyone who's been following Bitcoin is well awwre of that. Up until today, every single time some blog or news site has called anyone a "Bitcoin CEO", they've been ridiculed for doing so and for not doing their research properly. You all know perfectly well why Andreas wrote what he wrote. What we're discussing here is the mindset of the person who wrote the headline and since that person can't participate in this discussion you can't possible know their intention with the headline so stop blaming Andreas for assuming the term was used wrongly again when it's been used wrongly countless times before.

The white paper assumes all nodes are mining nodes. Remember, it was written in 2008.
Page 8 - Chapter 12 - Last two paragraphs:


Non-mining nodes serve as block relay hubs, nothing more. Bitcoin can function perfectly fine without any non-mining nodes. It would be a lot more centralized and less secure though. I guess BIP148 supporters don't mind worsening the security of the network and making Bitcoin more centralized, if it means they get their way.

Briefly explained, today I made, in bulk, 25 accounts with the bitaddress.org downloadable website on an offline computer with no haddrive in it, booted on a Ubuntu live CD.
Printed a psychical copy for safe keeping and put an .xlsx file with the public and private keys into a truecrypt container. Threw that onto a USB stick and put it into my Dropbox account.
So the 25 "accounts" are stored on:
-One piece of paper
-Inside an Excel file, in a Truecrypt container, on my Dropbox account.
It can be done even safer, but im comfortable with how it is right now.

Currently the blockchain is 14.2GB. That's roughly 0.355% of the space of a standard sized 4TB harddrive or 0.473% og a 3TB harddrive.
Let's say that Bitcoin takes off, big time, in the next 2 years and the block chain grows to 300GB. At that time, harddrives with capacities of 6-8TB will be normal, if not bigger.
At 6TB, 300GB is 5.00%, 
At 8TB, 300GB is 3.75%
Even with an explosive growth in the blockchain size, regular consumer harddrives will easily be able to store the data.
Of course, if we're talking EXPLOSIVE growth, only power users will be able to accommodate the blockchain data, but with that kind of growth they'll also have the money to buy the extra capacity ;)

Copypasta from Wiki:
"Today the Bitcoin network is restricted to a sustained rate of 7 tps by some artificial limits. These were put in place to stop people from ballooning the size of the block chain before the network and community was ready for it. Once those limits are lifted, the maximum transaction rate will go up significantly."
Regarding blockchain size in GB or TB, Currently, most home computers can fit a blockchain on their harddrive that is 10 times the size of what it is at this point. Also, downloading the entire blockchain isn't necessary if you just want to use Bitcoin as an average user.
In a few years, the size of the blockchain will grow significantly. However so will the storage devices we will have available along with it.

Eventually, the American government will try to regulate Bitcoin via controlling the way Bitcoin exchanges do business. That's actually besides the point.
Bitcoin has value because the people using it, *says* it has value. Currently a lot of that value comes from Chinese investors pouring money into Bitcoin. People are *saying* Bitcoin has value by taking what they find valuable (their money) and trading it for Bitcoin.
You can trade anything into Bitcoin, merchants do it every day. I could probably find someone who would buy my used smart phone and who would pay in Bitcoin. My *value* is my used smart phone. I'm placing that value into Bitcoin.
You cannot regulate what people put value into, therefore you cannot regulate Bitcoin. You can regulate a large exchange, sure, that's easy and that will eventually happen. You cannot regulate Bitcoin itself because you cannot control it.
Bitcoin is the virtual currency equivalent of BitTorrent. There are laws in place, in almost every country of the world, that prohibits illegal use of BitTorrent. Noone can prevent illegal use of BitTorrent because BitTorrent is decentralized (P2P) and therefore uncontrollable. You can try to control it, but you will soon realize that it is incredibly expensive to control even tiny amounts of the BitTorrent ecosystem.
I am fully aware of the fact that countries around the globe will eventually put restrictions on what the exchanges can and cannot do. However, imagine for a moment a world where the knowledge of Bitcoin is widely spread. Dollars and cents are controlled (as they are today, via your bank) but Bitcoin remains a currency that is as uncontrollable as BitTorrent is right now. Let's imagine that there is no way, in the world (due to extreme regulation and surveillance) that you can turn your Bitcoin into cash. What good is Bitcoin then?
Well, you can still send it over vast distances, instantaneously. It's still anonymous, if used correctly. It's still recognized as a currency. The fact that it is still recognized as a currency, means you can buy services for your Bitcoin. People can still sell your their services for Bitcoin (thereby again placing value in them).
What's important is the thought, the idea, that Bitcoin has value. It has value because we put value into it and value doesn't necessarily mean dollars and cents. Time and effort has value and when you can turn your time and effort into Bitcoin then Bitcoin will never cease to have value, regardless of the existence of Bitcoin exchanges.

- You can buy Pu Tea and the only purpose of the Tea is to either drink it yourself or sell it to someone else; Bitcoin can also be bought and sold, but Bitcoin can also simply be spent on goods and services.

Be careful about laminating the type of paper wallet provided by bitcoinpaperwallet.com if you printed it on a laser printer.
The heat from the laminating machine will affect the toner on the paper and will lead to bleeding of the toner to the opposite side of what it is pressed against, and vice versa.

Whenever you are setting up 2FA with the Google Authenticator, the site you are setting it up with will present you with a QR code that contains the private key information you need to later restore 2FA capability for that specific site.
You can consider that QR code a way to backup your 2FA for that site, so save a screenshot of it and put that screenshot into a secure Truecrypt container or similar.
Later, if you want to restore 2FA for website X you simply scan the QR code and the 2FA will work again on your phone.

Regardless, Peter Schiff ignores the fact that Bitcoin has real purposes. Those purposes have been listed numerous times on here, so I won't do it again.
Yes, Bitcoin can become this obscure technology that noone really uses in 10 years. To me though, that would be very unlikely, looking at the current adoption and the sheer amount of possibilities the system has and where we are in the world today with the corrupt banking system and the ever increasing credit card fees to name just two things.

You give the NSA way too much credit.
You can't stop encrypted traffic on all ports, unless you stop every kind of encrypted traffic on all ports. The NSA aren't gods, they too are limited by the TCP/IP protocol.

So PayPal can block you at a whime from receiving payment, if they deem the product you're selling to not be "OK" by their standards? To my knowledge eLiquids are not illegal in the U.S.. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
PayPal has in fact *chosen* to block your payment system because they *felt* like it.
P.S.: I got a 404 error when hovering your Bitcoin image. Also, make it smaller, it seems very "IN MY FACE!!" ;)

Bitcoin uses TCP/IP for communication, as does SSH, FTP, HTTP/HTTPS and a bunch of other protocols. That's my reasoning for saying Bitcoin isn't like TCP/IP.
TCP/IP is, as you said exactly, a transport layer. Bitcoin uses that transport layer to transmit information. You'd put Bitcoin in the same layer as the ones I listed above as they all rely on having a transport layer for communication.

I somewhat agree with you.
However, the financial experts as you call them, have been looking at known economic systems for years. They've never seen Bitcoin before.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:08:08
Many have tried to. None have come remotely close to the level of adoption Bitcoin has.

Furthermore, I don't think you math very well.
21 million Bitcoin, that's it. You can divide Bitcoin all you want, but you aren't making more of them. Changing how you present a number, doesn't change the number.
If I have 10 Bitcoin today and keep them for 100 years, regardless of if one Bitcoin is then worth $1 or $100.000, I still have 10 Bitcoin.
If a Bitcoin is worth $1000 now, and if I have one Bitcoin and we divide that Bitcoin into 1000 parts, I simply have 1000 times 1/1000th of a Bitcoin each worth $1, a total of $1000.
It's really not that hard.

Bitcoin isn't "like" TCP/IP.
If you want to compare it to another protocol, compare it to HTTP/HTTPS.
Go back 15 years and think about what HTTP/HTTPS was used for. This is where we are now with Bitcoin.

I see your point.
The Dropbox file is ofcourse encrypted. I put it into a Truecrypt container and put the container file in Dropbox. That way, I can also later change the container password to keep it "up to date" so I don't forget it.

The banks don't want the public to know how transfers really like take place.
There's no paper. There's no psychical material changing hands. No signatures. No manual typing. Nothing.
A "wire transfer" (makes it sound HARD right??) is as simple as when we transfer Bitcoin to each other. They put in an amount, a sender and a receiving address and BAM, it's sent.
But wait, they don't actually. We do, ourselves, through online banking... Which means... we're doing their job, for them, and they're getting paid for us doing their job.
They're laughing all the way to the... themselves. Criminals.

Bought 0.3 BTC at just below $1.000. I'm pretty happy :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:02:19
Thanks for clarifying what you originally meant. That makes a lot more sense :)

You seem rather "worked up" which is somewhat understandable. Currently, those 169 BTC cost you $1.500.
Take those $1.500 and secure them in a paper wallet/cold storage. Then start contemplating what to do.
Buying even more BTC would at first glance seem like a great idea. However the cost to you now, with your, im guessing, rather limited budget, would be pretty high.
My advice would be to hold 150 BTC in cold storage. Tuck that stuff securely away in 2-3 *secure* locations.
Then you can *play* with the remaining 19 BTC. Pull it out in dollars and get that investment back plus a lot more. If you have a loan currently, you might want to consider taking care of that ASAP though.
I can't tell you what to do since I can't tell the future and don't know your situation, but if I had 169 BTC, I'd use *some* of it to make sure my financial situation was stable and that any loans or debts were fully paid off. Then I'd start reading up on Bitcoin and make an informed decision that fits my lifestyle and who I am.

I sold 17 BTC back in February 2012 and between 30-40 BTC during 2011.
I did the right thing at the time and that's all that matters. Given the fact that noone can predict the future accurately, I have no guilt :)

Regardless of the speed of your miner, remember that the BTC value could potentially skyrocket one day.
Having had the option to mine that extra 1.5 BTC or whatever might suddenly cost you a small fortune if you didn't ;)

Even at 20% diff. increments and with an expected delivery date of July 1st 2014, the Neptune will barely even make ROI.

There's no law in any country, to my knowledge, that prohibits any person of any age from storing digital currency on any electronic device or in a psychical format.

Essentially to "Do with it as you please".
You can help family and friends by giving them money if they are financially troubled. You can buy expensive stuff for yourself. You can donate to charities and help the lesser advantaged. You support businesses that accept Bitcoin or a mix of any of the above.
When I say "Play" I say it because I believe it is important to feel that your investment paid off. Feeling good about the return on an investment will keep you satisfied and happy about what you've done, instead of making sit at home and count every cent the Bitcoin price rises and crying every time it going down by a dollar.
Take some of the stress off of your shoulders and reward yourself however you see fit. Acknowledge that what you did back then has turned out to be the correct choice and draw a line in the sand that marks the end of your investment period.
After that line in the sand, you now have 150 BTC and what you do from here on out with those, well... that's your choice :)

Remember, USB sticks can deteriorate and/or break. Make sure you at least have one copy that will never go missing or break. Truecrypt container with triple layer encryption made on an offline PC and put that container into SkyDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox or similar. Those services will still stand after a natural disaster hits your home.
