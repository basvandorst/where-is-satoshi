how many bothans?
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:49:17
do they have actual deployed machines? the picture on the website looks like a cartoon. I like that robocoin is a 700 pound monster. its a big secure device.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:22:23
they have a few different options. i use google authenticator with them.
@_date: 2014-11-09 13:07:32
I dont think bitcoin is meant to be anonymous.
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:11:24
I just bought some Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:08:45
one way...
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:51:48
Go to school, kids.
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:44:31
Ok! which one?
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:05:22
Good timing.

[WOOO HOO HOO!](
@_date: 2012-11-02 22:07:01
How so?
@_date: 2012-11-04 03:03:26
How do you purchase your coins?
@_date: 2012-11-02 22:29:47
[Why]( [would you]( [say that?](

Is there a better way to invest in BC? This is like trying to play an adventure game from the 80's. Did I use the right lexicon this time?
@_date: 2012-11-02 22:08:44
The password could have been better. It was unique. I have no clue how this happened. I will look into getting a Yubikey or something like that.
@_date: 2012-11-02 22:06:32
I run MSE and do frequent checks. I am pretty sure I am clean of that.
@_date: 2012-11-03 18:49:22
Is there a better BC bank?
@_date: 2015-02-15 13:54:51


Because when they made murder against the law, all murder stopped because it was impossible.
@_date: 2015-10-02 11:17:08
Do you have a good comparible alternative?
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:57:25
Betamax or VHS?
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:48:37
Yay! my first comment that pays!
I only called you out on it because I find myself saying "on tape" a lot when meaning recorded.
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:41:23
They held my money for a week and a half then returned it saying my transaction was "high risk" despite coming from a verified account at a large banking institution. After not having access to my dollars or coins for that long I bought BC with my regular BC provider. I asked Coinbase "why am I risky" and it took another week to get back to me. when they did they apologized and immediately pushed the original transaction through without my approval and over drafted my account. I didn't ask for that, so i asked for another explanation and never got a response. that was a month or two ago. These people are amateurs.

I don't like politics, but you must acknowledge their existence. Embracing the SR is bad politics.
Edit: Bob Guccione and Hugh Hefner made great strides for free speech and censorship, but you don't point them out too much in that context unless you have the right audience.
@_date: 2013-06-21 22:03:16
Wait... you aren't allowed to buy bitcoins? Why not? I didn't realize they were stopping people from buying BTC with dollars.
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:23:46
That's not weed.
@_date: 2013-09-27 00:03:53
I agree. I'm just saying you can't wave it like a flag in the same way you can't wave penthouse around as the figurehead of free speech. It's a good extreme example, but you shouldn't advertise it to people who are in the fence about the subject. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:52:12
No, they will not answer my customer service complaints.
@_date: 2013-07-19 02:09:21
Check your Swift code. They recently changed.
@_date: 2013-09-21 16:36:44
That's a good sentiment, but it's not practical. We should document, remember and recite this history as bitcoin grows, but we can not embrace it. Politics are real. They are illogical, but real.
@_date: 2013-08-23 09:05:25
You have BoA and you cannot log into their website and bank online?
@_date: 2013-01-14 12:05:47
This graph is NOT in millions of US dollars. It is in US dollars.
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:48:58
Hi Adam, I think the main problems that it is so hard to purchase bitcoins and your company is not helping. you just ad to the frustration and confusion. I have used your service and it is terrible and the customer service is irresponsible. if you want companies to take bitcoin as payment there has to be reliable ways to buy bitcoins other than through fly-by-night start-ups that obviously have no idea what they are doing.
@_date: 2013-08-27 00:13:09
They held my money for a week, then told me that my purchase was "too risky" took another 4 days to give me my money back and they still haven't responded to the emails i sent them asking "why".
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:52:10
@_date: 2013-09-13 21:47:06
or they could just use black on white so we could read it easier.
@_date: 2013-08-22 12:15:00
I wonder what they think of my GW posts...
@_date: 2013-08-27 08:00:37
It took them four days just to tell me "we are looking at this"
@_date: 2013-09-16 01:42:54
send a bunch of the next flyers to me and I will test it out for you.
@_date: 2013-08-27 20:38:01
They linked to my BoA account. They successfully withdrew my money and held it for over a week. They had my money, they knew it was good, and they knew my bank was legitimate (BoA jokes aside)
@_date: 2013-09-21 16:36:54
Dread Pirate Roberts.
@_date: 2013-08-27 07:57:44
It took them four days to respond with this:




This isn't a whole lot of cash, but it's enough money where these types of delays aren't acceptable. I can't be kept away from my money for well over a week without any kind of explanation.
@_date: 2013-01-10 23:09:28
Shit, people notice that?
@_date: 2013-09-22 02:53:38
I feel like bitcoin has a much grander destiny.
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:51:13
Do it online. I have BoA and their online system is really easy. It's still $45.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:39:09
Explain why you let hackers access my account and steal $750 from me then you did nothing to aid the police or track down the culprit.
