Andreas Antonopoulos was actively involved with Bitcoin since 2012. Shouldn't he have thousands of bitcoins and already be a millionaire before?

If you sold your bitcoin, or are just planning to buy more. Then caring how low the price goes matters because you need to be ready to buy.
However, if you're holding bitcoin, and plan on holding it long term - there's really no point in worrying about the short term price.

If I trade using 50x leverage and Bitcoin goes up 10%, I make 500% (50 x 10%). However, if Bitcoin goes down even 2%, I'm margin called and lose 100% of my investment (50 x -2%). Margin trading basically amplifies gains or losses, thus increasing volatility.

It takes years of experience to become good at trading. And even then, most professional day traders can't beat the market average.

If you see an incredibly active spokesperson for bitcoin that's been around since nearly the beginning, and who's done hundreds of technical talks around the world, it's unreasonable to expect that he's invested at least a few thousand dollars into bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:53:59
If he has zero now, then he should have capital losses instead of capital gains. He could use that to offset income he makes on his taxes until those capital losses are gone.

Not sure what industry you're in, or what you hate about the job, but there's plenty of jobs that pay well and that people love doing. Often times higher paying jobs in the same field are more rewarding as they usually allow for more flexibility, autonomy and work impact.
If your job sucks, it could just be the company that sucks and not the entire industry. Changing companies could mean a huge difference in how you're treated, work hours, benefits, etc.
If I were you I wouldn't change careers, but I would definitely consider looking into different companies.

Bitcoins were $1-30 each in 2011, you gave away $900-27,000 for lulz?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:49:49
6000 at 0.2 per BTC (optimistic settlement outcome) = 1200 BTC = $14,400,000.
6000 at $448 (pessimistic settlement outcome) = $2,688,000.
Don't know if he had 6000 BTC on there, or if he made a claim, but either way it's worth investigating.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:07:09
If you were that easily swayed into not buying it, chances are you would have sold it once it hit highs of $30, $100, or $250 anyways. So probably not a huge loss.
Tons of people including my friends, family, and coworkers told me repeatedly not to buy bitcoins, later to sell my bitcoins, and that I was an idiot, but my belief outweighed their advice.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:38:23
You don't need to be a mega multi-millionaire to do these things. You can find/make time while still working.
I also know a few people who've retired, and most of them say their happiness level is about the same as when they were still working.

If someone made a claim that almost half a billion dollars in coins was missing/lost from your exchange, I'm pretty sure you would refute it. No matter how tight-lipped you normally are.
The fact that he hasn't, yet continues to make announcements on his website, speaks volumes.

It won't be a Ponzi scheme if it's actually built into a great exchange.

Well if you bought from MTGox it kind of was.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:30:29
Why wouldn't it be priced at the norm? If they were actual coins that could be moved on and off the exchange, then they would be the true price. The only reason goxcoin prices is a thing is because you can't.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:35:23
I don't see how it's unethical to buy out a company.
Also it's silly to compare a company buy out price to the wage of a single employee.

Well, we're assuming that it's handed over to the users for no money.

No, any coins Gox is in control of will keep being siphoned off slowly until they declare that they were "stolen" too and have 0 BTC left.

Perhaps there should be a "test-coin" of sorts for new BTC code to run on. To make sure there aren't any bugs.

"The report details the loss, or theft, of 744,408 Bitcoin, or roughly $383 million based on this afternoon's trading prices.  
In the IRC obtained by FOX Business, Karpeles denies the document was produced by Mt. Gox, but confirms that it is “more or less” legitimate."
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:53:32

@_date: 2014-02-27 13:24:54
So we're assuming the SEO forum admin is a liar and produced that entire fake IRC chat.
We're assuming 2bitidiot is a liar, and produced several thorough fake documents.
We're assuming everyone who claims to have been following 2bitidiot, and know his character enough that he wouldn't make up stories for publicity, are wrong.
We're assuming MTGox won't refute the 750,000 lost BTC claim despite being given several days and several opportunities when they post their announcements.

No attack/hit points? Not a creature.

If that were true, then they were selling assets that weren't theirs. They would also have had to breach their cold wallet policies.
Wouldn't this be illegal?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:47:30
So the funds were stolen just last month? Right, so why weren't they paying out withdraws for many months then?
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:09:32
So did the funds go through?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:10:27
Except the previous information had been confirmed by various people including Mark K...
@_date: 2014-04-08 20:22:40
Assuming he did steal the coins, why would someone wack him when they could just torture him and get all the coins for themselves?
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:00:37
He "lost" them and he'll mysteriously "find" them once he's in the Bahamas.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:45:45
Well it'll be crowd-sourced.  
It'll have people who lost coins committed to promoting it/using it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:05:19
What happened? MTGox finally died.

If the exchange is great, then I don't see why it wouldn't attract new money. That, of course, hinges on the exchange being great.
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:10:24
Well, if bitcoin becomes more mainstream that 4% could easily become the norm, if not much higher.
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:32:40
**I'll tell you why, even if they don't take pre-orders.**
**Option 1**: Mine with 100 devices and make $500,000 in BTC gradually over the course of 6 months (assuming prices don't go up or down, another reason why many companies don't choose this option).
**Option 2**: Sell the 100 devices for $500,000 immediately. Then use that capital to expand the factory/shipments/employees/R&amp;D so you can produce double that amount.
Whether you mine with it yourself, or sell them to other customers. Difficulty will go up the same regardless. Why mine with them, when you can sell them and reap massive profits instantly? Even if they didn't invest in infrastructure, cash now &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cash over 6 months.
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:51:58

@_date: 2014-02-28 15:55:44
If it's actually a good, solid exchange. Then there'll be plenty of new users who use it. Along with previous MtGox users themselves (even those who lost money), investing new money.

Basically half a billion dollars goes missing and you're asking why people are "still going on about this"? It hasn't even been 3 months yet, and we still don't have answers. Are you retarded?

How the hell do you recover from losing 7.7% of all bitcoins in existence? Over half a billion dollars?
MtGox would have to be operating at high profitability for over 2 years just to hit EVEN. That's never going to happen.

I'm not sure you realize how an exchange works.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:57:36
Buying bitcoins is supposed to be risky because of the market price, not because of the chance that some scumbag can run off with them.

People will adopt it if it means cutting down on fees. Even if it's sending it to your wallet, or sending it to an exchange, why pay a high fee when it could be nearly free?
There's no immediate benefit to adopting Segwit, there is for using a channel.

And it might get even lower after trading picks up.
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:57:46
Yeah, relax. Just go with the flow.
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:56:20
If you have no immediate plans to buy/sell, then it's not worth looking at the price that often.

Not true, bitcoin cash's price was one of the highest day one.
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:44:52
If bitcoin goes to 0, it's not like one of the altcoins will suddenly jump to take it's place in value. Most likely something that catastrophic would severely hurt the confidence in digital currencies as a whole, and most of the top altcoins would suffer dramatic price losses. I'm not saying they would go to 0 too, I'm saying that expecting "skyrocket" gains is unrealistic.
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:32:56
Same reason it always goes up, China.
@_date: 2016-10-28 02:15:52
The price for digital currency is only because people are willing to pay that much, same goes for anything. I'm not disputing it's "real value". History is the best indicator for future behavior - take a look at the BTC/altcoin price history for any major up or down swing, and you'll know that what I'm saying is true.
Again, just disputing the claim that altcoins will skyrocket in a catastrophic event that brings BTC to 0. Anyways, you're your own person, feel free to invest in what you believe.
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:55:45
Usually the opposite happens. If the value of bitcoins plummets, every single altcoin also plummets in value as well (usually at an even more drastic rate) as the faith in digital currency is shaken.
When the value of bitcoin rises, altcoins tend to rise faster, as people believe the digital currency ecosystem has a future and that there could be room for other alternatives.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:09:55
You don't have to buy a single bitcoin, it's divisible by 100 million. 1 satoshi (the lowest unit) is only $0.000018.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:47:54
I don't understand, there were rumors about MtGox + people not being able to withdrawal for months before the collapse.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:30:41
Most altcoins are complete junk, and the recent pumps are fueled by hype and people who know very little about cryptocurrencies.
Always check your emotions (fear/greed), always do your research, and always try to play the long game.
Day trading is risky business, and even those with years of experience often can't beat the overall market.
The best time to buy is when no one's paying attention to it, and price is undervalued. Worst time to buy is when everyone is buying in and the price is sky high. Don't get suckered into FOMO. Time is on your side, be patient, there will always be opportunities.
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:03:12
Same, I've seen several sites use this term as well.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:24:07
I wouldn't sell off 50%. Bitcoin has the potential to grow much more over the years.
I would maybe look to sell ~2-5% of your current BTC savings each month. This way you'll still be gradually cashing out, but you won't miss out on price rises as much.
Also, pay your taxes on capital gains.
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:09:41
I know it isn't the best comparison, but gold's value today is mostly because of it's worth as a value store and not as a luxury or industrial product.
If a major alternative threatens to be a better value store, it could potentially steal a large chunk of gold's value.
