Do you want the private key to?
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:37:38
I understand your disbelief. Its hard to understand. Your not mining at the current time you mining in past time. Ok the block chain has a list of all transactions from past to present right. Ok your mining the past blocks with adjusted hash to move the funds from the lost wallets to your wallet when the blocks catch up with current block. Does that make any sense to you. I have gave you every thing i can man to how it works if this does not help i dont know what to say. I wish you the best of luck 
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:41:46
sorry for the misspelling my bad 
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:26:17
your entitled to you own view.
If peoples view is they think its a scam there more than welcome. i have ask and ask how and why you thank its a scam and no one is answering i beginning to thing yall go around to random post and do this to people for shits and giggles  
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:52:13
it create me a new wallet i give you every thing if you want it
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:11:43
LOL trace back further. If you don't be leave me that fine your inclined to your own view. im not going to say your wrong nor your right. If you be leave your right A++ to you. i have given you every thing you need to trace down the lost wallet. 
Have a Blessed day and wish you the best of luck. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:39:11
I would love to sit here and play a game of golf with you but your relying on old myths and old facts. The blockchain is not immutable in no way its a text by text algorithm based on sha-2 factor based from 1993 how can it be immutable. 
If it will make you fell better "no my way will not work" 
;) Ps that post/link is from 2016 try google
Have a Blessed day
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:34:53
lol have you read any of the last comments. you cant modify wallets i know that dip shit. agian what makes you think its a scam have you tryed my service if not how can you say its a scam
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:41:19
There is a first for every thing. what part of that do you not understand.
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:49:42
and again where is the problem. well i think your sun exploded  
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:13:38
what deposits there are none 
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:21:23
what makes you think its a scam
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:25:58
I can see were your coming from. A private key is needed only if you are sending funds from the wallet its-self but funds are not being sent from the wallet there being sent from the block chain. All BTC is is a hole bunch of hashes based on a Sha-2 a 256-bit (32-byte) text that can be reassigned to another party address  Sha-2 came out in '93 do you really thing it would be that hard ( Says in joking Way).   Hope that can clarify some. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:21:15
No brute force needed, just adjusting the hashes of the block chain to show that it suppose to be in another wallet. Not cracking private key.
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:38:34
still have not answered my question
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:14:31
were does it say send me bitcoin its free.
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:09:29
I understand where your coming from. If you take a look at the Lost BTC tab on the website you will see a list of all lost wallets/funds. Mining will try adjust the block chain in moving funds that have not been claimed or have been lost. It like solo mining but easier. Every one has a chance at mining on what ever pool they wish. It took me a while to set up but with my little antminer U1 i can do a few cents the more hash the faster it can 
 find and move them. Most people spend 1,000's of G/hs on solo mining im just trying to make it easier by mining whats already there and not being used. Hope that helps.  
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:46:02
I retract my previous claim.
I have taken all in to account and i would not have released for public use if i had not tested my self.
But i am thankful for the advice
@_date: 2018-09-20 01:06:15
Thank you i thought you would never stop lol
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:21:42
Have you ever mined before.
If not heres how it works
There is a stratum pool that is used for mining. and there is a worker (thats what they call miners) and people mine on a pool for money.
Your more than inclined to your own view as i stated before.
Ive told you im not scamming
Fell free to report the post. i have not broken any terms or conditions.
;)  
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:45:04
Thank you for the information the spelling will be fixed.
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:38:52
I wish you the best of luck as well.
Have a Blessed Day.
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:16:12
yes Its free!
No money Needed nor am i asking!
So how is it a scam!
So if you dont like it your free to leave!
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:38:01
nothing is impossible. who ever told you other wise needs to be slapped
 
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:22:49
I wish but all its doing is adjusting the hashes on the block chain to show that they were never claimed and moving them to the correct address of the user who did claim them.
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:27:35
ive asked your not answering
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:25:57
The entire block chain does not need to be rewritten only a few 16 bit hashes of the transaction where they went in to the wallet and never left. if there is no out put why does the whole chain need to be changed? If there is an out put then yes you would need to do the entire chain and i dont have the knowledge to even program some thing like that. all it needs is to adjust a few hashes. and BTC block chain is about 200 GB storage and it has over 5,000 nodes to change the entire block i would love to see some one try lol
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:40:07
the more you comment the higher rating i get so let it all off your chest 
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:27:16
Thanks for the advice.
Have a blessed Day
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:17:21
how the fuck do yall come to the conclusion is a scam.
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:49:30
I can do better i can give you the wallet. lol it ant much.
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:24:03
Glad you like!
