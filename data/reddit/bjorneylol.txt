I am aware what segwit is. 
Segwit gets fee subsidies, so if I hypothetically do not want segwit and abstain from using it I am penalized. By introducing segwit as a soft fork, users who do not want to use it are now forced to remain on a network where their non-segwit addresses are inferior. With a hard fork they could have just not upgraded if they preferred the other chain.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:09:07
Not really, considering that after Bitcoin core the most active clients are things like UASF, unlimited, XT, classic, segwit2x (with a combined user base making up 3% of the Bitcoin network)

Bitcoin hard forked to fix an overflow bug in 2010, core 0.8 was inadvertently a hard fork due to lack of backwards compatibility and the 0.7 version achieved consensus so there was no fork. ETH hard forked and many people chose the old chain. Segwit didn't have consensus so BCH forked.
I haven't picked anything to defend, I only asked you to explain what was actually wrong about OPs post, which you haven't, instead you keep changing the subject and offering strawmans.
p2sh had community consensus so there wasn't any outrage about it being a soft fork. segwit was argued over for a year and clearly didn't have that consensus.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:38:15
26 - why does that matter

Segwit was not a good example of decentralized consensus, and Dash's dao vote and subsequent hard fork is a better example of consensus than anything I have ever seen with bitcoin.

Honestly not a lot. ETH is the only major contender when it comes to smart contract platforms, XMR is the only contender for privacy centric coins.
BAT/OMG/Golem all seem like promising projects but I don't think they have as much room to grow since they are narrower use cases.
Nano/Iota are both unproven technology with too many kinks to be considered viable right now imo - they are speculative moonshots
I think dash had a good concept with the masternode/treasury but it's appalling how far behind it's fallen on the development roadmap considering it literally has a consensus mechanism built in that let's it pay developers full time.
Honestly I think the whole bigger blocks = less decentralization is exaggerated - even BCH with it's 32mb blocks will be something a hobbiest can afford to run at home (even though it will be years before it can even fill those blocks). Dash solved this by offering a portion of the block reward to node operators who staked coins, so that even those who couldn't benefit from the economies of scale associated with mining could contribute to the network without a financial burden.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:30:49
I was under the impression bitcore was a node.js wrapper on top of the core library (but I looked into it and apparently that's not the case - my bad)
Either way the point I was trying to make is that node count is so horrendously skewed towards Core on the BTC side that other clients are more or less footnotes (other than bitcore, almost all the nodes on the BTC network are remaining clients from old fork attempts (classic, unlimited, XT, UASF, segwit2x)

Please explain how that quote can be perceived any other way than suggesting OP take out a loan to pay off debt.
Please also explain how taking a loan leveraged against a volatile asset and paying down interest on that loan is better than selling and buying back later.
I have an idea of how salt loans work, but i don't think you have any idea if you think this is a good idea for OP. What if Bitcoin goes down? He is still in debt and now has to liquidate his Bitcoin at a suboptimal rate to pay off the loan he took out, plus he had to pay interest on top of it

LN routing has not been demonstrated with that level of usage afaik, so i would be hesitant to make that claim. 
Visa also has 880 million users, it would take 6-8 years of full blocks for each visa user to open their first channel assuming no other transaction happens on chain during that time (let alone, adding balances, closing channels etc)
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:03:25
Those are wallets and/or thin clients, which isn't really relevant.  98% of btc nodes are running some variant of Bitcoin core (the remainder are things like UASF, segwit2x, ABC/unlimited/XT back when they were BTC clients). BTC effectively means Bitcoin core.
Bitcoin ABC is only 65% of BCH nodes, the rest are mostly BU, then XT. BCH doesn't have an overwhelming client majority so you can't really say ABC == BCH

The whitepaper describes a protocol, rather than a specific implementation.  Core, Cash, BU, Classic etc are implementations of the Bitcoin protocol. In that regard, I would disagree with the "absolutely not Bitcoin" statement - it is absolutely "Bitcoin", just not "The Bitcoin" as long as it represents a mining minority relative to the Core implementation.
I would say the economic majority is intrinsically linked to that definition though - the implementation with the most economic support will be the more valuable coin, and whatever coin is the most valuable (per unit of hash power) will garner the most miner support.

If sha256 is broken the community will most likely hard fork and revert the chain to before the rewrite. It's not like people will "temporarily switch to LTC to transact during the downtime" because everyone's assets will be frozen on the other chain.
The only thing LTC does to complement BTC is provide an alternate means of exchange during BTC backlogs because it is less utilized and has a larger effective block size. In this regard LTC is arguably worse than ETH because there is less functionality and vastly reduced network security.
Arguing that using other coins as an alternative medium of exchange is a fruitless endeavor because it centralizes the ecosystem. If you want to transact with LTC you need to hold your funds on an exchange. If you want to use an atomic swap or decentralized exchange you need to publish the transaction to both chains (which is contrary to the reason you were transacting with the alt in the first place).

No, exchanges maintain balances on one, MAYBE 2 hot wallets per coin, and a handful of cold wallets. All user deposits are immediately pooled otherwise there would be no reasonable way to efficiently process trades/withdrawals. Exchange balances are entries in a database not tokens on a block chain. 
You clearly don't get the point (doubly so because I'm not even American). If 87% of wallets contain more Bitcoin than an American citizen could afford, then that makes 99% of Bitcoin users 'whales' to people in 3rd world countries.

DAO was 15% of ETHs market cap, the July parity bug was 0.15% (no hard fork) and this is even less than that.

"was it a bit? Or a byte? What's the difference between a mBTC and a Satoshi? Is the conversion 100000 or 1000000 to a BTC? What's that in dollars?"
Not as easy to grasp as "I have $50 worth of Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:44:41
Those are not numbers that are easy to remember. "You can buy in $1 increments" is the solution here

A one time small daily transaction (buying a coffee at a new shop) would require two LN transactions. The only way it would work is if a large institution operated a LN hub and processed the transaction on behalf of both the store and the user. This will lead to one major hub processing all transactions because nobody wants their funds locked up on Starbucks, Dunkin donuts, burger king etcs. LN hubs concurrently and thus we have a large company like Visa monopolizing all Bitcoin transactions because they have the most popular LN hub

You were probably around the break even point with non-asic hardware assuming North American power rates. So like $0.75c worth of Bitcoin a day at 2011 prices

Market cap is also heavily inflated for Bitcoin because of the huge number of 'circulating' supply that is no longer in circulation
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:05:58


So you are agreeing with what I'm saying - market cap should be calculated based on circulating supply not speculative supply
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:55:01
Either every user has to run a full node, or every user has their funds tied up in a custodial service.
Yeah I wonder why they didn't go for that...
@_date: 2019-04-27 13:48:26
Yes, the missing coins is priced in, which means when you use that price to calculate market cap, you should be using the circulating supply that is priced in, not the circulating supply that doesn't accurately reflect the number of coins in circulation.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:50:32
Yes the market cap influences the price, but so does TA and we both know that has no tangible bearing on bitcoin fundamentals
Bitcoin's market cap is currently 92 mil with a price of 5300 and a circulating supply of 17.6 mil.
Assuming 15% of coins are lost forever the ACTUAL circulating supply is 15m which means its 'real' market cap is only 80mil
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:53:28
Tons of things would. There is a 20mb backlog of transactions that gets dealt with at a rate of 1mb every 10 minutes. any of the proposed solutions to move transactions to secondary block chains (lightning, etc.) would help,  as would a block size increase (temporarily, until blocks fill again). Problem is nothing will get implemented without a large consensus and the network has been undecided for 1.5 years on the scaling debate now.

ETH wasn't rolled back to help a single entity, ETH was rolled back because a bug in the code allotted 1/6th of all existing coins to a single hacker, not completely unlike the time Bitcoin forked to make bad coins disappear in 2010

But since Bitcoins valuation is determined by demand, the pizza in your analogy would need to become tastier and more filling every time you subdivide it, which it doesnt

Roger is putting 4 million in holdings on the line, Adam organized a group buy rather than accept a 250 BTC bet (an amount he called pathetic) with his own holdings. 
Opinions of Roger aside, he isn't the one coming off as full of shit right now
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:49:03
This whole board seems to be saying that Bitcoin is what the market wants, not what miners want, but completely disregard the fact that miners represent the market.
If the market wants 1mb blocks then that chain will be more profitable to mine and consequently will attract the hash power. Vice versa for 2x. The most elegant thing about Bitcoin is that it is built to function when everyone is acting selfishly - hash power determines what Bitcoin is because hash power can't be faked, and it represents the most valuable coin in the eyes of markets and users
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:57:39
Everyone knew about it, and the market majority didn't care, otherwise ETC would be worth something
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:16:39
ETH wasn't rolled back for the sake of the user, it was rolled back for the sake of the network. If an exchange hack caused one person to gain 3.5 million Bitcoin it would be catastrophic and I guarantee the user consensus would be to fork it back
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:53:46
Ethers rate of production decreases exponentially but it doesn't have a hard coin cap the way bitcoin does. It may not be "deflationary" but to call it inflationary would be nit picking
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:52:44
Thats a pretty shit explanation, because it assumes that high fees has zero impact on usability or adoption. Also - if high fees are required for security then why is reducing transaction size on the roadmap at all?
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:56:06
You are paying to send the transaction and then the costs to consolidate the UTXO. It costs valve $2 to actually USE the $5 you send them, so bitpay includes that in their network fee.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:27:50


Yeah, so I guess you could say, hashrate and miners are representative of the market...

Lightning transactions aren't on chain so they can do whatever they want.
Obviously when you close the channel these have to get rounded off for settlement on chain so it's kind of a moot point

Everything under the sun is taxed more heavily here in Canada, as well as throughout much of Europe. We don't complain about it because it's high enough that public services can stay afloat.

If they find a valid block before they can download and verify the transactions they are likely just going to broadcast it as is rather than risk someone else finding it.

The ones I've seen have all been 10% premium. 5% is great considering that's almost what banks charge you to convert foreign currencies.
Bitcoin ATMs don't benefit from the same economy of scale of regular ATMs so they are probably way more expensive up front which gets paid down with these fees. I'm sure there is also overhead due to insurance and accountability - what if the machine gets broken into, what if someone plugs in stolen cash and the police seize your assets because of it?
