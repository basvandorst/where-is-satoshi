How do you think that it will keep? Now it is fluctuating between $15,200 and $16,000. Indeed at $16,000 there is a strong resistance level. 
Since Dec 8 BTC is moving between $15,000 and $16,000 with one important drop.

Or when you are dreaming that you pee and you wake up at the correct moment and finally you pee. Bull traps are these moments when you dream that you are in the toilet and you try to pee. In the end you pee in bed.

Indeed, Asian Markets open at the same time in which the CBOE launches Bitcoin Futures. It will be really important to follow side by side Asian markets and the CBOE’s actions. 
We need to be careful not to mix local and international influences in the markets. The CBOE will have an important influence in Asia, but lets remember that in South Korea the government may ban cryptocurrency exchanges. 
How much of the % change up or down will come because the CBOE and the Local environment? How can we measure and distinguish the impact of one variable and the other? Its quite difficult. 
If markets are up we can’t say that this is 100% because of the CBOE or 100% because of local topics. The same if the markets will operate negatively. 
I believe there will be a nice amount of buying pressure there.
