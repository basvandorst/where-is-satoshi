What looks good about the chart?  It's been in steady decline since July 13. From its peak, it crashed, regained but lower then the previous high and dropped again, regained lower than most recent high and dropped again.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  On very few occasion was it able to recover above its previous high and even then it was a nominal gain followed by a drop.  
Edit: never mind, you explained below.

Assume I want to buy 1btc.  I go to coin base and hand over $200 (roughly the current price and a round number to make the math easy).  In 5 days the price drops to $100 and my transaction is finally completed after the price drop.  Do I get 2btc or 1btc and $100 loss?

No they aren't culpable. Again, it's a legal product.  As I understand this guy is on trial because allowed (if not encouraged) illegal activity to take place.  
If I had a flea market and someone sold knives at one booth, baseball bats at another and third guy sold hatchets.   If these items were used to kill people I have no liability because they are legal products.  If I let one get sell meth, another sell heroin and third sell cocaine, I'd get arrested for it because I'm allowing illegal products to be sold at a venue I operate.

I think the difference is email was a unique communication method.  It provided something other communication couldn't - nearly instant transmission of text and files.  It was an improvement in current communications
I have something I can exchange for goods and services - the dollar. So bitcoin needs to better or at least solve a problem a that the dollar doesn't.  That can only happen with stability.

Because email allows near instant communication where US mail takes days.  Email and bitcoin are not analogous.  
I'm trying to figure out how bitcoin is better than the dollar.  I'm all for something better, but I don't see bitcoin as a solution to any problem that I encounter during my daily life

Then people would move to bitcoin but bitcoin is valued in terms of fiat currencies 1btc = $234).    I don't quite understand how bitcoin can become a stand alone currency.  If it could, and the achieve stability, it's viable.

Stability absolutely matters for currency.  Merchants won't accept a rapidly declining currency or they will have to rapidly change price just to keep up.  Buyers won't separate with a rapidly currency.  Why buy a pizza for $10 today when I can buy a filet mignon tomorrow for the same $10.

I haven't had a need for wire transfer so I don't know if bitcoin is an improvement.  Western Union, Wells Fargo and bank to bank transfers exists so I don't know where bitcoin fits in that niche.  
I'm talking about daily routine consumer.  The dollar does a really good job as acting as a medium for exchange.

How widespread are those needs and is there currently a way to do it better. So I can buy something from a business in CA with bitcoin and neither of us has to pay transaction fee typical with credit card.  The problem is bitcoins current volatility eats any savings to be made by eliminating transaction fees.  It needs to be stable to be a currency.

I'm a bitcoin lurker because I'm interested in the concept, but if govt subsidizes it you might as well just call a dollar and kill the thing.  A govt wouldn't just subsidize, it would regulate and control.  If bitcoin can't stand on its own, it can not stand.

But if it's a currency, it needs to be stable.  If I earned $315 in my paycheck last Friday and it's only worth $235 today, that's bad.  My paycheck isn't an investment. It's the mechanism I used to buy things.  That's what a currency is - a unit of exchange.  
Without stability, it can't be a widespread unit of exchange.  If there are dramatic drops in value, sellers won't accept it because there profits will be destroyed by the change in value.   If it rises dramatically, buyers won't use it because they won't want to buy something for far more than it is worth.
