Because the coins you have are a percentage of all the coins that exist. if you have 21 coins you own 1 millionth of all the market cap of the bitcoin. Not everyone can have 1 millionth of the bitcoin supply. as time goes on the later people wait, the more they have to pay for less coins. When i first bought bitcoins they were 20 each, i bought 20 and they cost me 400. Now to buy 20 it will cost me 4,600 for the same 20 damn coins. What will it cost in another 5-10 years? a lot more. So while you're sitting on a gold mine, people way down the chain might be making 0.00005btc per week. 5,000 satoshis per week, not a bad wage. Meanwhile you're sitting on 2.1 billion satoshis (at 1 millionth of the total supply) and lovin life. I guess whats hard to wrap your head around is the floating price. You're used to a fixed value. 100 cents/pennies is 1 dollar. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:31:15
I think any time bitcoin is mentioned it is planting the seed, people will decide good or bad, but the more people hear about it the more people discover how good it is and hopefully how transformative it will be and spread the word. All news is good news.

"Instead of a war on poverty, they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me...."
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:56:33
The key here is "Divided" 1 bitcoin divided to satoshis is 100 million. You can either say you have 100 million satoshis, or 1 bitcoin, Both are correct, but if you give away even 1 satoshi, you now have less than 1 bitcoin. If you give away 0.5 bitcoin, you only have 50 million satoshis left.

Yes, just imagine a pizza. it has 8 slices, you own 2 whole slices of that pizza.. now evenly cut all 8 slices in half. Now the pizza has 16 slices, however they are all skinnier and now you now own 4 of those (2 cut in 2). Cut the 16 slices in half again and you get 32 slices, of which you now own 8 even skinnier pieces etc etc....... each time you still own 1/4 of the pizza... That never changes

Bro, lets say theres only 2 bitcoins ever in existence. you get one and I get one. the bitcoin price is 100 million dollars per coin. This makes the market cap 200 million. each bitcoin can be divided down to satoshis. So assuming the above rate, 100 million satoshis is 100 million dollars. (ie 1 satoshi per dollar). If the price goes up to 200 million dollars per bitcoin, your satoshi is now worth 2 dollars, however there is no increase in bitcoins, only the value per bitcoin. you and i still both have 50% of the coins. As the market cap goes up, your bitcoin has a higher value, but you still have the same amount of bitcoins and the same percentage of bitcoins. If today you have 5 bitcoins in a trezor, you have 500 million satoshis, but you dont tell people you have satoshis, for the same reason you dont tell people you have 10,000 cents in your wallet, or pay 1500 cents for a movie ticket at the theatre. 1 Bitcoin is cheap now, however if it hits millions per coin the purchasing power of that coin will mean that instead of today buying a skateboard for 0.25btc, you will pay 0.000008btc instead. A much smaller chunk of your net worth. Hope this helps.

Some do at a cost. You have to realise it's not feasible to have customers hanging around plant shredders especially if you have 2-300 clients that all want to monitor the destruction. its a safety hazard. One client of ours was a particular embassy and they were the only ones who we would let supervise a shred. they paid a high premium for the privilege so it was allowed. Basically most companies simply trust that their documents will be shredded, and if you go to a reputable company you will have no issues.

That selling at a loss realises those losses. only time will tell if that was the right move. The history of bitcoins price movement is a reminder that we've been in this situation before. Now before those parrot on about how you cannot predict the future based on past results, If you're afraid and want out then go for it..... many have done so and regretted it. Those who bought late 2013 (like me) have a different perspective to those who bought 2011/2012. As for rubbing it in, tough titties if people ignored bitcoin until it reached its peak and are now regretting it. I sleep fine because i'm not in the hole if the whole systems goes under.

I had a discussion with a work colleague in regards to buying a bitcoin and he stated (price was around 800 at the time) that he would consider buying at 600. It kind of blows my mind that something that has a change for huge roi all comes down to a couple hundred dollars. I dont think he understands the potential, however I know he has to believe himself and do the due diligence so suppose either he'll never buy, or will only buy a fraction in future. oh well.

I don't see bitcoin as a payment system, I see it more as a way to store value that just happens to be fairly easy to spend/transfer instantly compared to banks. yes the value swings all over the place, but its still only early days...... 
@_date: 2014-11-23 15:16:24
Who's pushing? If you're not comfortable at this stage using it, then don't. nobody has a gun to your head. in the meantime people are working on safer ways for newbs to store their money. bitcoin is not without its risks i'll be the first to admit it, however its a completely voluntary protocol. If you want to use it you need to do the research to learn how to secure your coins. Now what value that has vs the benefits of bitcoin at this stage probably suggest that most people without some technical skills shouldn't get into bitcoin yet.

That's a common line trod out ad nauseum here.  How much of the populations there use their local currency vs how much people use bitcoin? how about a bit of perspective. The technology is still early, its complicated for most people, so it's too early to count bitcoin out of the game based on volatility. Give it a few more years when the mining rewards come down and other economies have taken a fall.  Perfect opportunity for a remindme.... Happy to be laughed at if it fails....

No one can make that choice for you, however hopefully the more you read and learn about it and how it works, the more confident you will be and want to buy some to play with. Theres nothing to say that this could fade out into obscurity and you lose your money. theres also nothing to say that this doesnt take off and reward those who invested early. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose. There are a lot of pro bitcoiners in here (myself included) and some of the over enthusiasm can cause you to get swept up in the moment and invest irrationally if you're not careful. good luck.

Just because you are mega paranoid, doesnt mean the trezor is any less useful. You're more likely to screw up something the harder you make it to access your btc.
To OP: I say if you can afford it, buy it and try it out. Satoshilabs have made a great product. It was built for people who want to keep their bitcoin safe without having to go to extraordinarily complicated lengths.
I use Armory offline storage as well (requires a second pc) and keep a bit in both. Armory is a bit more of a pain to use, however that depends on how often you are retrieving funds. Also consider that if the bitcoin price goes up in future, the amount you have could suddenly become a real large chunk of change. Countless people have been reckless with their holdings then kicked themselves when the value shot up.

You create the transaction on the online wallet and save a transaction file to a usb stick and plug into offline computer. then you click sign offline transaction and the offline computer will authorise the transaction. then you plug back into online computer and broadcast the transaction to the network. This sounds hard, but its really 2 minutes work to do once its all set up. All in all less than an hours work to initially set up for peace of mind. The online computer has all your addresses and BTC amounts, so all the offline computer needs is to sign and you're off.

No one can know this, however what we do know is how many bitcoins will exist and work of some assumptions. One of those assumptions is the financial world not being able to fix its own problems, hence people losing faith in the current climate and starting to think about diversifying into PM's, real estate and bitcoin.. Im very bullish, but not enough to sink me if it doesn't work out. Can't wait to see how this pans out.
* Edit - Assuming the Bitcoin economy keeps growing and evolving into a more user friendly system, the decrease in bitcoin has to lead to higher prices. At the moment we're keeping our head above water in terms of price, but what happens when the supply halves in 2 years. And in that time how many more users will there be?

Mass marketing. Signwriters, billboards, those mobile billboards on the back of scooters, blanket tv coverage. Large btc value competitions, heaps of charity donations, BTC faucets, bitcoin sponsored road runner type giveaways (like radio stations have that give away free stuff). 
More research on peer to peer shared blockchain pieces, ie 100mb per device with an app/program installed, with automatic lottery incentives to keep it running constantly. Have bitcoin seminars where they teach you everything you need to know and be comfortable with using this technology, then at the end you get rewarded with BTC to spend when you leave. 
BTC sponsored private cars, wrapped with the big logo and a qr link or web address and paid a few hundred or so for a year of advertising....... stuff like that.

In hindsight its easy to say that, however you need to look forward man! dont look at what could have been. First time i heard of bitcoin was at around 5 dollars when someone had their wallet.dat stolen and they had lost at the time a huge amount of which i cant remember but enough for me to find out. i looked into it and got a wallet for myself and got some faucet btcs, but purchasing at the time was way too convoluted so didnt keep up to date until mid last year.

First of all welcome :). Second of all if your son wanted to purchase drugs he could buy off friends probably easier than going through bitcoin related drugmarkets
Thirdly have a talk with your son and let him know you are always there for him no matter what. there is nothing in the world you can't talk to me about and that includes drugs.
I should point out that just like alcohol, there's a huge sliding scale from those who are responsible and have a few odd drinks every now and then to those who wake up every day needing a top up before going to work. This also applies to illegal drugs. It depends on what kind of attitude your son has and what events are occurring in his life at the time.

This is whats great about bitcoin. Its the ultimate tool for those who hate endless money printing. Its the ultimate tool for keeping financial transactions semi anonymous. Its the ultimate tool for sending grandma some cash in syria, its the ultimate tool for micro payments, etc etc the reasons are endless and every person has a different motive whether its selflessness, or selfishness, everyones welcome to participate for any reason and there are no wrong answers. I think this is what gives bitcoin its strength, the freedom to take the protocol and do what you wish to do with it.

I'd like to know how much money will return back to the bottom rungs of society with bitcoin.... If we have a fairer monetary system, surely one would think the distribution of wealth would be a lot better as well. I'd like to hope that people who invested early and got a huge amount of bitcoin would be more likely to dish it out amongst their peers as they didnt earn it the traditional way. I know if my small stash gets to astronomical figures im sure as hell not going to hoard it like scrooge mcduck. Im sure im not the only one with the thought of future charitable inclinations. Just a thought. Someone holding trillions can do a lot of good for humanity.

I think he said  "I'm not comparing the regulation of cars to anything. I'm saying Bitcoin already is regulated.

Sorry guys, $69 AUD for postage is ridiculous.

Even if satoshi cashes out it still does not undermine the network itself. someone else buys the coins he sells, he has then given up his share of the coins. Sure, such a sell off would dump the price a bit, but overall its a drop in the ocean. I cant wait to see if anything happens from his stash in the future. right now there isn't enough stability for him to cash out without causing big problems but in the future, not so much. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:15:34

What do you think happens when wall street money starts flowing in? It starts to redistribute wealth to people and give them a chance to give back to society. One of the reasons we are in this mess is the prosperity is being held back by money being sucked out of the economy.

I used to work for a shredding company. Most of the documents that were shredded were done so just in case as a matter of prudent document management, but were not necessarily destructive to the company if they got out. most shredding bins are used for waste paper from photocopiers. some highly confidential documents are shredded first, then put in the bins for further shredding (like payslips, sensitive proprietary info etc). The sheer volume of paper that gets put through the shredders makes it a painstaking job to read everything that comes through. Safety in volume. where i worked (relatively small company) we would shred upward of 25-30 full household bins of paper per day (240l). Literally tonnes of paper. Some companies do not shred, but simply dump all the paper in a sea container and send it offshore for recycling. For embassies, they escort you to the facility and overlook you shredding it all.

My Advice, sell 2/3rds, use the other third for bitcoin charities or giving back to the very system that has just given you this wonderful gift somehow. Win win situation. Its an awesome position to be in and i think you could do some real good for a lot of people later down the track it this takes off. Either way congrats and good luck.

Money seems to be the common ground for which bitcoin can represent everyone, regardless of affiliation or political persuasion or country or personal morals.  bet you could find a hundred different reasons why people get into it.... from savers, remitters, speculators, innovators, anarchists, it just brings everyone together.

you generate the receiving address based on the key derived from when you create a new wallet. this key is randomly generated to form a bunch of words that allow you to spend from and create new addresses you control. these words are your backup to be able to recreate your wallet balances you can create as many addresses to receive funds as you want because the secret key is used to sequentially make new addresses. the hardware allows you to sign transactions securely, without revealing the secret key used. Check out this link to get an idea of how to set up a hardware wallet.   
Bottom line, you create the secret key on your app (mycelium/breadwallet etc) or your hardware wallet (trezor/ledger)
@_date: 2017-01-01 10:03:47

wtf are u on about?
@_date: 2017-01-29 06:04:51
the key is the offline signing of the transaction. the hardware wallet makes it secure to move and spend coins from your wallet. there is always the risk when you regenerate your keys to spend on a computer or phone, that this key can be stolen. Trezor is now even more secure as it's weakest part was the recovery seed to restore your balance. now after the latest update, the recovery seed is done on the device similar to how you put your password in by clicking boxes, to which the values are only shown on the device. this means the key can't be screen or keyboard captured....  Much more secure. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:45:52
Don't forget to dump it so we can all laugh later
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:10:13
There is also the chance many will keep the coins, as a risk free way to diversify. especially if the price has risen substantially before the bches are free. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:49:38
so many missed opportunities. to be fair BITCOIN IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND EVER CREATED. even the professionals took a long time to try and find the catch before coming to the conclusion that it's legit. most people probably missed it a couple of times before actually sitting down and investigating how it all works. I first saw bitcoin at 5 bucks but dismissed it like most as some scam.
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:06:08
what? are you telling me people use other peoples images? impossibru!
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:30:16
thats the game everyone should be playing. set aside a few bucks for trying to day trade if you really want to, but leave a fair chunk in and don't touch it until you can retire.
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:07:20

There sure are some thick people commenting on here. Bottom line, Don't use your exchange as a common bank account. don't leave funds in that you aren't going to be actively trading with. It's just bad practice. if one of the exchanges goes tits up, don't come on here whining that your coins have been hacked. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:34:56
dry your eyes mate, nobody likes to see newbs crying on reddit.

@_date: 2017-08-21 12:11:37
Not raising the blocksize before it became a problem, then blaming the spammers for congestion for using the network as intended is an insult. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:34:44
supply of new coins is hard coded into the protocol to reduce by half every 4 years. 2012 it went from 50 every 10mins to 25/10mins. Last year it went from 25/10mins to 12.5/10 mins. in 2020 it will again reduce from 12.5/10mins to 6.25/10 mins and so on.....
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:45:34

No, please do. Im up for a laugh. lets see how brainwashed you are.
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:25:30
id like to think every time the price goes up, more people get excited enough to buy some, which spreads the bitcoin out further amongst the masses. some will sell later on to others etc and the cycle continues. the more people who buy the more people will realise they are making money for nothing and ride it. those who cash out only increase the chance of more holders getting some long term spondoolies.
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:05:54
I am in no way suggesting you buy now, but do you think you're too late to the party? if so what would you think if it went to 2k. my point is you're not too late, however you will be paying more for the opportunity..... don't invest more than you're willing to lose....
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:21:31
can't have that.... much better to stomp your feet and have a sook
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:11:11
so they should be. there's nobody behind the steering wheel
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:16:42
We did settle, are you aware of the recent hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:45:09
see you in another couple of years, WHEN YOU WILL REALLY HAVE MISSED THE BOAT!.... but seriously, theres no better time than now. no point trying to buy at 100k
edit: Consider this. 80% of the supply (maybe more) have already been issued. theory has it that at least 1 million are lost etc and cannot be spent, every 4 years the supply of coins drops by half. last year we went from 25btc/10 mins to 12.5btc/10 minutes. in 2020 the reward goes to 6.25, in 2024 it does to 3.125, in 2028 it goes to 1.5625.. Do you think once the supply drops that low that people will be less interested or more interested? I believe the demand will way outstrip supply, and hence cause the price too become mooncheese. what do you think will happen? spend accordingly. good luck.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:29:43
no it wont
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:07:06

@_date: 2017-01-02 05:13:22
its not too late to get 3 bitcoins again. it will just cost more now. just get 10 bucks at a time for then next couple of years...
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:48:14
Most of us here consider the moonshot anywhere from 100k to a million, so theres plenty of room, limited supply, and the take up is still super small because everyone still thinks its a ponzi. they won't once it starts hitting 6 digits, by then the rewards won't be as great.
consider it a long shot and only invest money that wouldn't make you bankrupt. good luck
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:48:20

@_date: 2017-08-15 09:45:16
the hardware wallet just signs the transactions using your private key, which is derived from those 12/24 words. if the wallet fails, you just buy a new one and recover from your words

Are you kidding right now? so the backlog a few months ago benefited users somehow? by making it longer and more expensive to transact. How much coolaid have you drunk?

The question is, will you tell everyone you're broke again in a few years time when you could easily have just invested now instead? inaction is keeping you broke.

super cool tiny perspective bro.

I wonder how we got in this situation? All starts with the leadership. they could have increased the blocksize and there would be no forks, no bullshit and everyone will have been better off. They made their bed, now they can lay in it.
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:10:22
no thats whats great about bitcoin. People sacrificing their coins for the greater good. we all get bonus value from it.

Worst piece of advice i've seen on a bitcoin forum. Computers cannot be trusted. viruses, keyloggers, remote logins can all turn your cash into someone elses cash (There are plenty of people who have been burnt). The purpose of a hardware wallet is that the private keys stay on the hardware device, and the signed transaction is the only thing that ends up on the computer to be transmitted.

I think so mate, in the next decade there will be another 2 halvings (3 in 11 years from now) which will really constrict the amount of coins available. we are currently at 12.5/10mins, by 2028 it will be only 1.5625/10 mins. and by then who knows how many eyes will be watching, looking to get in. HOWEVER IN SAYING THAT NOTHING IS GUARANTEED. do not invest more than you are willing to lose.

until it gets even higher and they feel like an idiot for not putting something in there.... heck, it may even take 3 or 4 looks at the price  and everyone around them talking about bitcoin before they finally get some.... realistically though, those people are just stuck in their old ways and that's fine.

Maybe a countdown timer of x seconds can activate when the amount is x% larger than the standard current fee. that way you cant physically press send and have a chance to fully comprehend what you're doing. it makes sense. All it takes is a small moment of inattention...

Wouldn't it be nice to let the network grow to that size instead of sitting on 1mb like idiots hey? who's worse? someone blocking progress now? or someone letting the network grow and worrying about it when it is actually a real issue?
@_date: 2016-12-11 11:57:32
Yeah why bother fighting it. it's not like we have the ability to plan it out better by increasing the blocksize first or anything instead of rushing into it
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:42:48

Bitcoin actually reaches its theoretical limit around 2100, however there are plenty of subdivisible units to share around. 2,100,000,000,000,000 units(satoshis) to be exact. The price can hit 100 million per coin and still be spendable in 1 dollar amounts. And with a simple change, the decimal can be pushed further out to divide the coin even more.

If it dies, it dies. If it cannot stand up to attacks then its not worth using. there are plenty of other cryptos out there (i say this as a long time hodler since the first 2013 rise) Majority of my stash is still bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-28 16:09:09
Yeah don't worry. like 5 percent of the miners are with you.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:46:48
You seem to forget one person does not speak for many. Maybe some real questions should be asked as to why this may be the case.... alas i suspect you don't know what happens outside the walled garden of fail.
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:01:28
sounds like a whole heap of hot air coming from you champ. you may need a bit of fresh air.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:41:32
This could have been prevented, don't blame the miners for 3 forks, blame the developers for not giving the people what they wanted all along.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:38:14
You mean to tell us that miners are just in it for the money? quick somebody get to the batphone and call satoshi.
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:43:23
like you do yourself a disservice to humanity?
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:34:54
Some people believe that the whole world will implode because 2mb. I say they need to get other opinions rather than the shit they're spoonfed.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:50:45
Just relax kiddo, nothing to worry about
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:08:06
whats your point exactly? do you go creeping at night to see what your old girlfriend is up to too? lmfao
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:16:48
when you initialise you choose recovery seed instead of new wallet. it generates the same wallet based on the recovery seed. then you set up decent password, and you're good to go. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:08:21
Relax kiddo
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:22:33
not if the chain dies with no support.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:28:30
Is that all you've got? Did he run over your dog or something? lmfao
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:41:35

@_date: 2017-09-28 15:58:41
no shit sherlock, nobody was going to pay 10 dollars to use bitcoin. everyone scattered like ants to better coins. now bitcoin is a ghost town
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:22:55
and as a result the alts have gained a massive amount of ground.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:38:46
Its only unsafe because you've been lied to over the last 2 years.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:56:49
That's laughable... no keep on doing what you're doing and lets see who comes out on top.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:37:00
Ignorance and dumbasses thinking 2mb blocks will ruin bitcoin. don't be thick

step out of the chamber bro, it's turning your mind into spaghetti.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:26:32
you do realise 2mb blocks have been repeatedly called for now for at least 2 years. this should have been nothing but a distant memory but it has fallen on deaf ears, so now it is being pushed by the majority. its a shame this has taken so long for such an easy step.

chillax. the fork only happened a couple of months ago. quit being such a drama queen
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:19:28
Forgetting the fact that the bitcoin network shat itself and sat there like a stunned mullet for weeks while all the alts gained massive market share. Great strategy bro. Don't need big blocks if everyone bails.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:46:10
That's perfect. maybe you can message everyone who uses bitcoin and they can look up that handy obscure URL so they don't get overcharged. yeah nah.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:49:12
Or perhaps they lost faith after all the mental retardation that exists in this sub.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:57:37
Theres enough loyal bitcoiners ready for that mass dump, google the slaying of the bear whale. Many cheap coins were bought that day, I got myself a bargain that day as many others did.

Hardware wallets create a firewall between your private keys and the internet. and you have your seed words to recover your funds just in case the hardware wallet fails.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:03:34
if bitcoin fails, another will learn from it and be stronger. move along, nothing to see here
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:00:22
Are you kidding me? a hardware wallet gives you a paper wallet with the added bonus of being able to transact safely... this guy was a numpty for not backing up his "paper wallet"... whether the keys are derived from 24 words or the actual key it makes no real difference.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:00:46
Don't feed the trolls mate. Guess who owns @_date: 2017-10-31 15:41:17
Theres always a dip, however that dip may end up being higher than when you first thought about buying in. If you believe in moon prices, buy in now and regularly tuck away a few bucks here and there
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:30:30
And people are equally free to sell their coins and dump the network. nobody is being forced, and the crypto ecosystem is still a beta project. don't invest more than you are willing to lose through (in your opinion) unwanted consensus
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:28:46
nothing you can do. it has 90 percent miner support. this means whatever you do, you will be doing as a minority chain.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:30:37
And when the next wave of people try to use bitcoin and it shits itself again, do you really think anyone is going to actually want to hold bitcoin after experiencing such a schemozzle? not likely my friend.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:44:29
and now heres /bitcoin screaming that the world is going to end and stomping their little feet. both just as bad. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:29:22

@_date: 2015-04-08 09:51:47
The risk is you lose what you put in. the upside is being financially independent. Buy based on your own circumstances, treat your purchase as a gamble and hope for the best!

if regulatory agencies are able to influence btc so easily, then btc is not worth holding. good news is there are plenty of other coins and they can't all be co-opted.

Its highly likely that the more people need to rely on the blockchain, the more the native currency to interface with said blockchain will be worth. This also depends on how quickly the money flows around. I say yes.

Eventually people will realise they are better off holding btc and transferring directly. I believe remittance will be a temporary thing at first, then gradually become less important over time.

No such thing as safe, everyone is hopeful and thinks it will. definitely make bitcoin part of your financial plan just in case, however spread your risk amongst other assets.

The bank's excuse is bullshit. When you use most reputable services you are required to provide id to be able to create an account or deposit cash. And places like coinjar allow you to fund your account from your regular bank account which has a full trail. They just want to choke innovation, And hopefully the accc does something about it.

Different. the hardware device signs the transaction using the private key inside the device. the signed transaction cannot be modified after it leaves the device and gets broadcast to the network. The private key never leaves the device. It's like having a little midget inside signing cheques. And boy do they get angry if you don't feed them.

Consider this. Everytime you use Circle your transaction details are sent to you via email. We know that email is compromised, therefore your email is attached to your real life identity via circle, and thus should be relatively easy to track unless you break the chain somehow via mixing or exchanging between different alts.

Since you're being [ernest]( They could, however they would need to overcome the huge network effect that bitcoin has. Whatever the other coin is, it would have to be pretty darn good to supplant the Bitcoin network. Theres nothing stopping users from transferring out and into whatever the latest coin is either. Just have a look at coinmarketcap.com where bitcoin is dominating big time. This of course doesnt mean bitcoin cant be overtaken, however you would see that happening well ahead of time, and if you were smart, you'd throw a few bucks that way and hedge your bets.

Heya CleverEmu, 
Nearly all wallets are now HD (Hierachical Deterministic) which basically means all your accounts derive from a master seed which can be a password or a series of words. The beauty of this is you no longer need to keep backing up .dat files anymore, when you can just enter your seed words and re-generate all the accounts on any device. While Coinjar is great, I wouldnt recommend it for storage of your coins. One of the owners has a shady past. Having said that i dont think theres any danger in purchasing coins through there, i have many times with zero issues. Good luck Bush Chook ;)

Trezor have a plausible deniability feature where you use a password to gian access. all you need to do is set up your trezor so it loads a small value wallet by default (no password) but have the real wallet seed activated by an actual password. when you go through customs you can show them the default blank password wallet with little value on it (put like 50 or 100 on there so its legit)... that way you can plug in and show customs a small amount, but keep the other wallet a secret
@_date: 2015-03-01 07:01:25
I dont think you do know. 1 bitcoin can by divided into a hundred million pieces. you dont need to spend 250 to buy 1 coin. you can buy 10 bucks worth if you want.

The Labor Government did this in Australia on a smaller scale at the height of the financial crisis. giving 900 dollars to every Aussie.

I don't spend bitcoin with the exception of changetip, however just because i dont use it right now doesnt mean i wont use it regularly in the future when the infrastructure makes it easier. I'd love to be able to visit another country and withdraw into a local currency from a bitcoin atm and avoid the banks altogether. so short term its more idealogical, however im long and think this is too good a technology to fall by the wayside. But having said that, dont put all your eggs in one basket, diversify people.

just because they are able, doesn't mean they will. if they don't think they are of any value now, they aren't even going to get in at this current price. You have to play the long game to see how this all works out. Good luck

Hey Patchy, try:  getbitcoin.com.au,   I think btrade is the cheapest both in terms of fees and going rate. also i have used btrade and getbtitcoin and spendbitcoin at least once without any problems.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:28:25
Heres what i've discovered so far:
(4.4% fee  getbitcoin.com.au - used this no probs)
(4.9% fee  btradeaustralia.com - used this no probs)
(10% fee   spendbitcoins.com.au - used this, expensive)
               (bitcointrader.com.au - Not used yet)
               (coinloft.com.au - not used yet)
               (bitxoin.com - not used yet.)
Anyone else have any other sites they know of? Anyone had success with the last 3? bitinnovate used to to be the go to place but they have suspended operations.
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:31:27
Just shop around man, currently btradeaustralia have the best rate but before i buy, i always compare the other rates and none of them have beaten btrade yet. these sites will keep popping up and competing with eachother. competition is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:56:16
Bro, don't stress, Here are some alternatives:
Its really easy. Submit a buy request, take money to local bank, deposit cash into their account using their reference number, then sit back and watch your bitcoins arrive in your wallet. She'll be right cobber.
