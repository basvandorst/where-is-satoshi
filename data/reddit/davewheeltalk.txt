Any update that's resistant to quantum cracking would probably need an entirely new cryptography scheme.  That means every existing private key would be no good anymore, which would make Bitcoin (and any elliptic-curve cryptography, which most cryptocurrencies use right now) fundamentally broken.
The only way you'd be able to save yourself is to sell off all your BTC before it's too late, and to buy something quantum-resistant like IOTA with the money.

I know this is a way old post, but I've been hoping somebody was building a bot.
Features: I'd want a bot that can watch your wallet addresses, and can automatically send you a message when any transaction involving your wallet address is executed.  I would also like scheduled alerts telling you the balance in each of your wallet address(es) once per week.
Platforms: definitely Facebook Messenger, also maybe Telegram.

If I'd bought into cryptos about 3 years earlier, you'd be on the receiving end of some Reddit Gold right now.
Unfortunately for both of us, I didn't.  Still thought you should know...

Sent a 1sat/byte transaction about 2 hours ago, to see if it would confirm and how quickly.  The wallet I was using said to expect 7 hours until confirmation - let's see what tomorrow holds.

Edit: I honestly did not realize that these aren't common in Europe anymore.

Points taken, you're right.  I was just afraid after the insane fees, and the insane  mempool backlog that we saw 2 or 3 months ago, and was pleasantly surprised that this all worked out.

Yup, I feel the same way.  For this transaction, I actually was moving from a non-segwit address to a segwit address (both mine, both on my Trezor) so I actually had a practical reason to send anyway.  And when you're sending to yourself, sometimes a 7 hour confirmation time is no problem at all.
That said, I'd probably go closer to 10, maybe 15 sat/byte if I needed to get money to someone else ASAP.  That would still confirm in like 30 minutes, in all likelihood.  I'm just impressed that 1 sat/byte did work (and in a matter of hours, not a matter of weeks) in this case.

TIL that checks aren't used much in Europe anymore!  Sorry for laughing at you.
But, yes, in the US it's still very common to pay rent, property taxes, utility bills and such using a check.  If you owe the government money during tax season, you would send it to them using a check; if the government owes you a refund during tax season, they would send it to you using a check.
Several grocery stores and clothing stores also accept checks in the US too - but most customers will use cash or a credit card instead.

I mean, I wanted to move everything from the non-segwit account on my Trezor, onto the segwit account on my Trezor anyway...
If anything this is anti-spam!  Now I have all of my BTC in a place where segwit is activated!  :D

Really, as a hedge.  I hold on to about one-tenth of a BTC, so that I can take a small win the next time there's a bullrun.  I definitely do invest in other (faster, fee-free) coins as well.
I believe in the adage that BTC is crypto gold (a store of wealth), and other coins are crypto currency (an actual means of spending).
