For those wishing this would go to ten thousand right now, it's actually a terrible idea to have a large stake of people using it on mainnet this early.  It's not secure yet and it needs refinements.  Though it does help the developers to have some people take the risk and start using it, but keep the amount of BTC small enough that it won't hurt you to lose it, because the risk is still high.  That won't change for about a year, and then maybe exchanges can start coming into the space, and then we're golden.
Remember: if you start using lightning before 2019, keep the amount of BTC involved small enough that you can afford to lose it.  We'll get there in time, HODL.

I'm sure I'll get knee-jerk downvotes, despite owning BTC.
I send Interac transfers with no fee, and pay no fee on my credit card either, given that I never leave it unpaid.  Instant and virtually flawless in being reliable.  Maybe with very large transactions BTC is competitive, but only from being faster to transmit (it's not even cheaper than wiring).
Bitcoin won't come close to being competitive until Lightning is universally available, with convenient interfaces set up in every wallet so non-technical people can use it too.  And even that wouldn't be enough, as people opening payment channels still require a transfer each to set up, and having millions of people go do that would use up the blocks for several weeks.  Throw in unrelated non-lightning transactions and it would be months of escalating fees and long delays.
The engineers working on crypto have their work cut out for them.  I wish them the best of luck and I believe in this cause.  But this forum is filled with the delusional behavior.  How can you people not tell that this is still a few years away, probably?

I give about a 70% chance that Satoshi's coins sit there unspent for eternity.  Satoshi might be dead.  And even if alive, they would paint a terrifyingly large target on their back if their addresses make contact with the real world.  I can only see them ever being spent in a minority of outcomes where Satoshi is A) alive, and B) BTC develops extremely thorough privacy methods (it will gain better privacy over time, but it probably will never be that private IMO).
Which I'm totally cool with; more value for my meager amount of BTC then.

I'm at the level where I refuse to even "sell" in the sense of converting back to fiat.  I demand to see the Bitcoin project go to its technological endgame, which will make it possible for me to just spend my BTC directly on goods or services somewhere (if anyone intends to lecture me about how you can do that now in some narrow ways, what's available right now is inconvenient and quite inadequate for most people, and it's not helpful to pretend otherwise.)

You mention "support", "getting involved" and "making things happen".  For what you are talking about: what does it consist of, and how does it make any difference? If anything, the recent bubble-ish attention has drawn more government scrutiny, not less.  Technological development is the bottleneck, not hype.  What specific thing are you doing that you think makes a difference to the devs? The only possible things I can think of are bug reporting, lobbying governments to not regulate, managing a crypto startup that isn't a scam, or fetching a dev lunch for them/doing their laundry for them, on the premise that the favor made them more productive.

"Nobody actually bought that high. If they had, the price would have stayed there. "
That is pretty silly.  Every single price you see on a broker's chart is a price where someone did, in fact, buy.  And people buying that high is perfectly compatible with the price later plummeting.  It doesn't at all predict that the "price would have stayed there", that's a very strange portrayal of markets.  I have no idea how you typed that and thought it reflected how the market works.

When you say "more taken from me than owed by the welfare statists employed at the IRS", are you just saying that you will pay the same tax rate as a no-coiner in the same tax bracket? As opposed to what? Please clarify that.
I'm also confused about your first sentence.  People who conspicuously consume can indeed have that used against them in matters of tax evasion.  Are we not talking about tax evasion? That was what I assumed.
Interestingly, I don't even need to have an opinion about whether you demonstrate "guilt", "intent to cheat", etc.  I merely predict that if anything remotely in the direction of hyperbitcoinization happened, governments would adjust their policies.  They would almost certainly find a way to catch you\*\*, as their incentive to put more effort into that goes up.

"It really can't go down to 3K at this point."
Delusional statement.  It is always possible for the price to go lower, until it goes to zero.  If the price was $100,000, it would still be possible for it to go to 3k or even $3.  There will never exist a time when the price "can't go down to 3k", that's not how markets work; it would just take more extreme conditions to induce such a price.

This is incredibly terrible advice.  It can *always* go lower.  You don't know 100% that the BTC project will succeed, nor that you won't lose your BTC (many people have).  And whatever percent less, that's the percent that you're willing to throw your current \*and\* future savings away.  The people who made a killing by taking out a loan to buy BTC played Russian Roulette and got lucky.  You don't hear from the people who quietly live ruined lives.  Having a chunk of my portfolio in BTC (plus DCA every month) lets me know stress-free that if BTC succeeds I can retire no problem -- and if something goes wrong, my life is not ruined either, I'm right at [the sweet spot](  I can't imagine the anguish of someone already broke getting into debt and then losing the investment.

Sanity check: stock to flow makes predictions that don't make any sense (finite valuation when block rewards are very small, and then "infinite" and/or mathematically undefined valuations when the block reward becomes zero).  Additionally, it's based on few data points.
So just HODL and don't get too married to a model that is actually highly flawed in multiple ways.  Vaguely speaking, BTC's valuation is the state of its tech divided by how high-functioning governments are.  Governments can be expected to continue being dysfunctional, and the tech can be expected to improve, so we're good for the foreseeable future.

How is Bitcoin more portable than fiat? Where can I carry my ledger nano s that I couldn't carry either a banking card, or physical bank notes? If anything fiat is more portable because it can be safely jammed into places that an electronic wallet can't.

I have no idea how you're suggesting the only difference in risk is the interest on the loan, and not also the lost principle that exceeded the person's capacity, and the opportunity cost to your future self who is now unable to invest that lost future income.  Suppose you lose the BTC investment; in one scenario you were paying 50 a month, you lose what you had invested up until that point, and you move on with your life.  In the other scenario you also lose the principle of the loan, and you are locked in to keep paying off interest plus the principle.  If we add another financial setback on top, then for at least half the population this would be financial ruin, it's hardly melodramatic.  The only people for whom this makes any sense would be people who had more money in an illiquid form (so the loan would be collateralized, and THEN you can say the only difference in risk is interest).  For everyone else it's financial Russian-roulette.

Roughly speaking, the occasional price rallies will likely continue until the network stops improving, or until governments become high-functioning.  Neither of those are likely anytime soon.  There is a variety of major improvements to the network that are being researched or tested, and governments are structurally designed to not change very much.
I give an 85% chance that we see $250k USD at some point, and a 15% that the project dies before that price.  I also give about a 70% chance it eventually reaches $1mil (this would not be for decades, if it happens).

I understand totally why people react that way, given how many delusional idiots like Bitcoin.  My first major exposure to Bitcoin was from an old coworker who is a crackpot that believes in all kinds of pseudoscience and scams.  Of the various risky or unproven things he was into, one of them happened to be  Bitcoin.  And he was extremely vocal about Bitcoin to anyone who would listen.  This was in 2015, and I have barely spoken to him since.
And I don't intend to.  He was a crackpot then, and he hasn't changed.  Even a stopped clock is right twice a day, and my least favorite thing about crypto is the *fucking morons who are into it,* who think they're non-conformist but they're unbelievably overconfident about certain memes and notions.
So every time someone reacts badly to Bitcoin, I remember that delusional idiot who happened to be vocally into Bitcoin.  And I understand completely why the reaction to be bringing it up is so negative.
And it works out because, from an investment standpoint, I don't need to advertise Bitcoin (contrary to the said morons).  The network isn't remotely ready for mass adoption anyway.
The reason is YOU, you fuckers.  Every time you demonstrate terrible portfolio management, every time you start saying crackpot economic ideas or tinfoil hat notions, every time you share a misleading crypto media article, you make it harder for other people who wanted to talk about Bitcoin.  Let Andreas promote Bitcoin and shut the fuck up.

I disagree for multiple reasons.  Partly because there have already been many ways to hedge against inflation for a long time (such as an index fund, owning a business, commodities for people who are bad at researching what performs well in the long-term or who are retiring soon and need an acyclical to sell if equities tank, etc).  But more importantly, Bitcoin has far better things to offer than mere inflation hedging.  I lose a small amount to inflation because of my money that I have to keep in cash form, but most of my net asset value is inflation-hedged and I don't really care as much as some others seem to.  I lose probably about a hundred bucks a year.  Annoying but honestly not that important to me.  To someone who isn't well-educated, or high-functioning enough, or well-connected enough to have this hedge taken care of, then yes it's really terrible, but for me it's not a big enough problem to lose any sleep over.
Bitcoin's value proposition is the new experimenting with institutional designs, in a manner that skirts around incumbent institutions.  That is the MASSIVE value proposition that many people don't understand.  Bitcoin won't bear its full fruit for decades because building new institutions takes time -- unlike hedging against inflation which I can get done any time.  It's the increased possibility of different kinds of institutions that wouldn't be able to exist before (an example is prediction markets, though that's almost entirely on Ethereum).
Additionally, there is a side-effect of the deflationary part of bitcoin that I think is also more valuable than the actual inflation-hedge part.  It's the effect this would have on consumer behaviour.  One of the side-effects of monetary inflation is a reduced incentive to be careful with your resources, rather than spend only on things that are important.  Deflation encourages hoarding of money, which means velocity plummets and people don't spend.  Inflation encourages "waste" (many smart people would disagree with me that it's waste but I'm pretty sure it mostly is), and is in my opinion a serious negative.  I want companies selling short-sighted and unimportant things to go bankrupt, for the most part.  It's easier to have that happen with a fixed money supply, where everyone is actively trying to not spend money -- which is how I want people to actually handle their money, and I disagree with those smart people who say monetary deflation is bad.

It makes an asinine prediction: price goes to infinity when block rewards go to zero.  The only coherent scenario that maps to that is all fiat going away and therefore BTC/USD being "infinite" in the sense that USD is valued at literally zero, which isn't happening.
A related problem: it predicts ongoingly exponential returns in the coming years, but that doesn't make sense.  BTC's volatility will continue gradually falling, along with the returns tapering off as the market cap gets bigger.  This seems incompatible with what stock to flow predicts.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:07:23
It is bizarre how the rhetoric in this community assumes that hedging against inflation is either new or difficult.  There have been many ways, for many years.  My BTC could just as easily be an index fund, which also hedges against inflation.  (I own both.)

EDIT: Oops I was off! See mrmishmashmix's correction below.
Since it's a poisson distribution, the standard deviation is actually the same as the mean average; i.e. 10 minutes.  And a counter-intuitive fact about poisson distributions: it doesn't matter how long ago the last block was, the next one still has an expected time of 10 minutes from now! Even if it's been an hour, the expected time for the next block is still, on average, 10 minutes from now.  These numbers are assuming hashrate held constant, and some other things like no delay from broadcasting.
So waiting 30 minutes is only a +2 standard deviation event -- something that should happen more than 2% of the time, given an ordinary distribution and nothing unusual happening.  It doesn't necessarily indicate anything wrong with the network.  I wouldn't start to really worry until you hit an hour or so; that's not desirable, although again, it will happen once in a blue moon even with no unusual events or issues, just randomly.
