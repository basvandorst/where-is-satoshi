Police departments are known for having a fairly strict budget, so when they can expand that budget by focusing on crimes which use lots of cash or easily liquidated assets, you wind up with a war on drugs.

How do you "short" Bitcoin? I'm new to this whole investing thing and I've heard the term used a ton
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:17:51
I use Bitcoin Chart Widget. It works pretty good.

It's a currency that is still brand new. It's not stable yet. Give it time.

They sell your coins lower than market value and buy coins above market value.

Wooow this is a useless bot.

It shows the wrong perspective.  A 50% drop just relates percentage change in Fiat, not to actual buying power. If I had 1btc at $10,000 vs 1btc at $100, the difference is much more than 2x buying power, despite the graph only showing double the height.  It hides the true buying power and hides the true loss that happened in the crash.

What is north of the north pole?

Wow that logarithmic Y axis is misleading. I'm not saying we're not going to the moon, but making $100 the middle point of that axis is purposely hiding the crash we just went through.

~~It's under 9k now. :(~~
Back at 10k.  I'm very happy I put a buyback at 9.1k.

Three years from now: "you didn't buy in under 10k?"

If they are "what's really running the country behind the curtain" then surely they would have at least some hand in that.   
I know they have power, but not that much power.


And shhh. I know that, and you know that, but I'm not entirely sure op knows that.

Please, do go on.  I'd love to hear your theories on how the fed has lead to Trump's approval rating being below 40% pretty much since January, or lead to bush being thought of as incompetent, or Lincoln being the most memorable president. 
I love fairy tale stories!

That's how you know how bad things are here.  We are non-ironicallyposting fucking McAffee tweets about bull runs.

On a local level it's not unheard of to go without power for weeks or even months in a natural disaster.  It'll be pretty hard to spend any crypto with no power at all. And I'm saying this as an owner.
